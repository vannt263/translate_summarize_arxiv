    "the discovery ( johnson et al .  1972 ; leventhal et al .  1979 ) of the diffuse galactic positron",
    "annihilation radiation at 511 kev from the inner galaxy has led to extensive studies of the possible origin of the annihilating positrons .",
    "these studies have shown ( e.g.  ramaty & lingenfelter 1979 ; kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 ) that , of all the various potential sources , the positrons from the decay of radioactive nuclei produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae are the largest and , hence , most likely source .",
    "recent measurements , however , have raised new questions about the source .",
    "analyses of the measurements by the gamma - ray spectrometer ( spi ) on esa s integral spacecraft of the distribution of the diffuse galactic positron annihilation radiation have shown that the luminosity of a galactic positron bulge within 1.5 kpc of the galactic center is @xmath1 1.4 times that of the galactic disk ( kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 ; weidenspointner et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a ) .",
    "their best fit models are either concentric shell sources , or gaussian spheroidal sources , in a bulge extending out to @xmath1 1.5 kpc combined with a thick disk with a half thickness of @xmath7 0.4 kpc , that extends from the galactic center to well beyond the solar distance of 8 kpc .",
    "they also find a large additional contribution from a spherical halo extending beyond the bulge .    in order to compare with these observations",
    ", we use these model fitting definitions of the positron bulge , thick disk , and halo , following kndlseder et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and weidenspointner et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008a ) in all of the discussion that follows , although both have been defined in various other ways in the literature .      the best - fit analysis of the spi / integral first year s data ( kndlseder et al .  2005 ,",
    "shells+d1 ) gave a 511 kev line luminosity of @xmath8 photons s@xmath9 in a spherical bulge from 0 to 1.5 kpc and an old , thick disk luminosity of @xmath10 photons s@xmath9 , scaled to a solar distance of @xmath11 8 kpc .",
    "this gave a bulge to disk 511 kev luminosity ratio of @xmath12 .",
    "the subsequent best - fit analyses of the first two years data , which included more coverage of the disk ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "2007 , for 4 nested shells and old disk ) , gave a bulge flux of @xmath13 photons @xmath14 s@xmath9 in spherical shells out to 1.5 kpc , a thick disk flux of @xmath15 photons @xmath14 s@xmath9 , and a marginally detected spherical halo flux of @xmath16 photons @xmath14 s@xmath9 from 1.5 to 8 kpc . to infer the corresponding 511 kev line luminosities , we use the flux to luminosity ratios from their earlier modeling ( kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 table 3 ) , which are essentially just @xmath17 where @xmath18 for the bulge , about 0.57@xmath19 for the thick disk , and about 0.93@xmath19 for the halo . from the best - fit fluxes",
    ", we infer a 511 kev positron bulge luminosity @xmath20 photons s@xmath9 in the spherical shells out to 1.5 kpc , and a thick disk luminosity of @xmath21 photons s@xmath9 for a @xmath22 .",
    "most recently from more than four years of observation , weidenspointner et al .  ( 2008a , model bd ) fit the 511 kev fluxes and luminosities to a two component narrow ( fwhm of 3@xmath23 , or 0.42 kpc ) and wide ( fwhm of 11@xmath23 , or 1.5 kpc ) spheroidal gaussian distribution and thick disk from more extensive observations that increased the effective sampling distance to 0.75@xmath19 for the disk .",
    "they found best - fit fluxes of @xmath24 photons @xmath14 s@xmath9 from the bulge and @xmath25 photons @xmath14 s@xmath9 from the disk . scaled to @xmath11 8 kpc",
    ", these fluxes give a best - fit 511 kev luminosity @xmath26 photons s@xmath9 in the spherical bulge @xmath0 1.5 kpc , and a thick disk luminosity of @xmath27 photons s@xmath9 .",
    "this gives a bulge to disk 511 kev luminosity ratio of @xmath28 .",
    "they also found a best - fit combined halo and bulge luminosity of @xmath29 photons s@xmath9 for similar scaling , and subtracting the bulge luminosity , suggests a spherical halo luminosity of @xmath30 photons s@xmath9 beyond the bulge , for a total galactic 511 kev luminosity @xmath31 photons s@xmath9 .",
    "best - fit spi / integral spectral analyses by weidenspointner et al .",
    "( 2008b ) also show an asymmetry in the positron annihilation line flux from two opposing inner disk components at 0@xmath23 to 50@xmath23 to either side of the galactic bulge .",
    "these show an @xmath32% excess in the 511 kev line flux at the negative longitudes compared to the positive .    assuming simply that the positron annihilation and production rates are in local equilibrium , these observations of the luminosities have been taken to imply a similar bulge / disk ratio and asymmetric spatial distribution for galactic positron production .",
    "this suggested production ratio and distribution has challenged supernova source models , since it is much larger than that expected from the distribution and mean bulge / disk ratio of galactic supernovae ( e.g. kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 ; weidenspointner et al .",
    "as we show , however , these spatial properties can be fully explained by positron propagation .",
    "we also consider the other two fundamental spectral properties of the galactic positron annihilation : the ratio of the broad to narrow 511 kev line emission and the fraction ( @xmath33 ) of the annihilation that occurs via positronium ( ps ) formation .",
    "as shown by jean et al .",
    "( 2006 ) neither of these can be explained by any of the proposed positron sources , either old or new , without extensive positron propagation , since all of these sources are expected to produce most of the positrons in the hot tenuous phases of the interstellar medium , which can not be their primary annihilation site .",
    "for this reason alone a detailed treatment is required of the production , propagation and annihilation in each phase and region of the galaxy .",
    "studies ( e.g. guessoum , et al .",
    "1991 ; guessoum , et al .",
    "2005 ) show that positron annihilation in different phases of the interstellar medium occurs in differing ratios of direct annihilation on both free and bound electrons , to indirect annihilation via positronium formation , depending on the ionization fraction and temperature .",
    "direct annihilation produces two photons at 511 kev , while positronium annihilation produces either two 511 kev photons or a three photon continuum depending on the spin state .",
    "positronium is formed 25% of the time in the singlet state , parapositronium , which annihilates with a mean life of @xmath34 s into two 511 kev photons , while 75% of the time it forms in the triplet state , orthopositronium , which annihilates with a mean life of @xmath35 s into a three photon continuum between 0 and 511 kev ( e.g.  guessoum et al .",
    "1991 ) .    the spi / integral measurements of the ratio of the galactic 2@xmath36 511 line flux to that of the 3@xmath36 continuum in the bulge and disk shows that the bulk of the positrons annihilate via positronium ( ps ) with @xmath37% ( churazov et al .",
    "2005 ) , @xmath38% ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "2006 ) , and @xmath39% ( jean et al .",
    "the weighted mean positronium fraction of @xmath40% also allows us to determine the total galactic positron annihilation rates , @xmath41 , in the bulge and disk , since @xmath42 . from the above",
    "we see that @xmath43^{-1}$ ] , which equals 1.69@xmath440.17 .",
    "thus the inferred best - fit positron bulge and galactic disk annihilation rates are @xmath45 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 and @xmath47 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 using the previously derived l@xmath48 and l@xmath49 . in the hot tenuous plasma of the halo , however , the positronium fraction depends on the refractory grain abundance , ranging from only about 18% with narrow ( fwhm @xmath1 2 kev ) 511 kev line emission , if all the refractories are in grains , to 42% with broad ( fwhm @xmath1 11 kev ) if the grains all disintegrated ( jean et al .",
    "thus we assume a possible range of @xmath50 there .",
    "from the best - fit halo flux , we thus infer a halo annihilation rate of @xmath51 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 , implying a total galactic positron production rate of @xmath52 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 .",
    "the width of the 511 kev line also depends on the temperature of the medium and its state of ionization which effects the fraction of positronium formed by charge exchange with h , h@xmath53 , and he by superthermal , @xmath110 ev , positrons as they slow down ( guessoum et al .",
    "1991 ; guessoum et al .",
    "the prompt annihilation of this fast moving positronium produces a characteristic broad ( fwhm @xmath1 6 kev ) component of the 511 kev line , while the subsequent thermal annihilation , either directly on free and bound electrons or via positronium formed by radiative combination or charge exchange give much narrower ( @xmath0 2 kev ) lines .",
    "even the annihilation in the hot ( @xmath54k ) , tenuous ionized medium which would produce a broader ( @xmath110 kev ) line from the hot free elections , can instead produce a narrow line if most of the positrons annihilate on refractory dust grains ( guessoum et al .",
    "1991 ; guessoum et al .",
    "2005 ) . the dust",
    ", as it does with interstellar molecule formation , provides a 2-dimensional regime with much higher interaction rates for surface chemistry .",
    "the width of the galactic bulge 511 kev line measured by spi / integral from the first years data has been recently fitted ( churazov et al .  2005 ; jean et al .",
    "2006 ) by two components with about 67@xmath4410% of the emission in a narrow line with a width of 1.3@xmath440.4 kev and the remaining 33@xmath4410% in a broad line with a width of 5.4@xmath441.2 kev by positronium formation in flight , giving a broad / narrow 511 kev line flux ratio of @xmath1 0.5 .",
    "the combined positronium fraction and relative fluxes of the broad and narrow 511 kev line emission strongly constrain the bulge annihilation processes , as we discuss in detail below .      the large difference between the ratio of the 511 kev annihilation line bulge / disk luminosity and that of the expected positron production by supernovae has led to suggestions",
    "there is some new , unrecognized source of positrons in the galactic bulge .",
    "this seems unlikely , however , since various recent reviews ( e.g.   dermer & murphy 2001 ; kndlseder et al .",
    "2005 ; guessoum , jean & prantzos 2006 ) of the potential galactic positron sources all conclude that supernovae are still the most plausible source and that other suggested sources , including cosmic - ray interactions , novae , and various exotic processes , all seem to be weaker and much less certain",
    ".    however , as we have shown ( e.g.  guessoum , ramaty & lingenfelter 1991 ) , the 511 kev annihilation emission only illuminates the annihilation sites , not the sources , of the positrons , since these positrons must first slow down to energies @xmath2 10 ev before they can annihilate .",
    "thus , we examine in detail the propagation and annihilation of the @xmath55-decay positrons in the bulge , disk , and halo , and we show here that the expected positron propagation and annihilation are very different in the bulge and disk , and the cloud and inter - cloud environments . when these differences are taken into consideration , we find that the spatial distribution , the 511 kev line widths and the positronium fraction can all in fact be clearly understood in the context of a galactic supernova origin .    although positron propagation has previously been discussed , the arguments range from the simple suggestion ( prantzos 2006 ) that most of the disk positrons might diffuse along dipolar field lines and annihilate in the bulge , to monte carlo transport simulations ( gillard et al .",
    "2007 ) suggesting that they travel less than a few hundred parsecs in all but the hot phase .",
    "we therefore also carefully examine both the physics of mev electron propagation and the observational evidence of such propagation from extensive measurements of solar flare and jovian electrons in the heliosphere .    here , we examine in detail the mechanisms of the relativistic positron propagation in the various phases of the interstellar medium .",
    "overall , we assume that the galactic stellar and interstellar distributions are defined by two superimposed systems : a stellar bulge - disk - and - halo system of stars and an interstellar bulge - disk - and - halo system of gas and plasma , as shown in figure 1 . the stellar bulge and disk populations essentially determine the distribution of supernovae from the decay of whose radionuclei the positrons are born . following ferrire et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the interstellar bulge , disk and halo define the distribution of gas and plasma where the positrons die by annihilation .    as we discuss in more detail later , the stellar bulge is confined within the interstellar bulge , which is blown out by a bulge wind to about 3.5 kpc in the galactic plane and above the disk it feeds and merges into the halo .",
    "the stellar disk extends not only throughout the interstellar disk out to at least about 15 kpc , but also all the way into the interstellar bulge .",
    "the interstellar disk , however , extends in only to the outer edge of the interstellar bulge , and starts in the so - called  molecular ring \" at around 3.5 kpc , which is defined primarily by the two opposing innermost spiral arms .",
    "threading the combined stellar and interstellar systems , is the galactic magnetic field , along whose flux tubes the positrons travel from their birth to their death .",
    "we assume that the flux tubes are nearly vertical ( e.g. beck 2001 ) , perhaps dipolar , in the inner part of the interstellar bulge and are blown out by the bulge wind ( e.g. bregman 1980 ; blitz et al .",
    "1993 ) roughly radially in the outer bulge , out to the molecular ring , where they begin to be tightly wound into the spiral arms of the interstellar disk ( e.g. beck 2001 ) . there , in giant star formation regions along these spiral arms , hot , massive ob star associations are formed , whose collective supernovae generate superbubbles , that blow out plasma as well as flux tubes into the overlying halo ( e.g. parker 1979 ) .    within this framework we model the various aspects of the production , propagation and annihilation of galactic positrons .",
    "we show that roughly half of the galactic positrons are born in the extended interstellar bulge ( e.g. ferrire , gillard & jean 2008 ) in the inner @xmath1 3.5 kpc of the galaxy , and nearly all result from snia occurring in the hot , tenuous high - pressure plasma fills nearly all of that volume .",
    "we show that @xmath1 mev positrons created in these snia supernovae are expected to escape from the remnants into the surrounding tenuous plasma",
    ". there they propagate along magnetic flux tubes by 1-dimensional diffusion , resonantly scattered in pitch angle by turbulently generated magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves that cascade down to the thermal electron gyroradius . in these plasmas",
    "the diffusion mean free path is long enough that only a negligible fraction annihilate there and @xmath1 80% of the positrons escape down into the dense hii and hi shells of neighboring molecular clouds within 1.5 kpc , where they quickly slow down and annihilate , while the remaining @xmath1 20% escape out into the halo and disk beyond .    in the galactic disk beyond 3.5 kpc , the filling factor of hot ( @xmath56 k )",
    "plasma is more modest ( @xmath1 20% ) . here",
    "the plasma is mostly in superbubbles , created by the correlated core - collapse supernovae of massive stars .",
    "consequently , the bulk of positron production via @xmath57al decay , synthesized by these stars , occurs preferentially in the superbubbles .",
    "the larger bubbles blow out into the halo , sweeping the magnetic flux tubes up with them .",
    "again the diffusion mean free paths of the positrons are such that the positrons escape along the flux tubes , either up into the halo , or down into the warm ionized envelopes , surrounding the base of the superbubble generated chimneys , where they slow down and annihilate .    in the warm ( @xmath58 k ) , but essentially neutral hi gas , which fills the largest fraction of the disk @xmath3 3.5 kpc",
    ", we show that the cascade of magnetic turbulence , created at parsec scales , is damped by friction between the ions and neutral gas long before the cascading turbulence reaches the positron resonant gyroradii .",
    "thus the positrons suffer much less scattering , and stream along the flux tubes with an isotropic pitch angle distribution .",
    "therefore the positrons also mostly stream out into adjoining phases , either into the halo or into those warm ionized envelopes , separating the ubiquitous warm hi gas from the hot superbubbles , where they slow down and annihilate .",
    "therefore we find that roughly 1/2 of the positrons , produced anywhere in the disk @xmath33.5 kpc , slow down and annihilate there , primarily in the warm ionized gas , while the rest escape from the disk into the halo .",
    "this escape thus accounts for the low observed annihilation radiation luminosity of the disk and explains the observed ratio of annihilation rates in the bulge and disk .",
    "moreover , the efficient diffusion of positrons out of the hot tenuous plasmas in both the bulge and disk , where nearly 70% are born , and into the warm ionized envelopes and cold neutral interiors of molecular clouds , where they annihilate , also explains both the observed positronium fraction and broad to narrow 511 kev line flux ratio .",
    "the positrons escaping into the halo from the bulge and disk also lead to the annihilation of roughly 1/3 of all the positrons in the halo , even though there in no significant production there .",
    "although the processes of galactic positron production , propagation and annihilation are rather straightforward , all the details still make the determination of the expected 511 kev line emission both lengthly and complicated .",
    "we consider positron production from the decay of three separate long - lived radioisotopes , each synthesized by distinct classes of stars : the @xmath59ni and @xmath60ti , respectively , by snia and snip from thermonuclear explosions of @xmath1 gyr - old accreting white dwarves in close binary systems , and the @xmath57al by young ( @xmath0 40 myr ) , massive ( @xmath3 8 m@xmath61 ) stars , most likely through wolf rayet ( wr ) winds and core collapse snii and snibc .",
    "the supernovae , snia and snip , from older stellar populations are known to occur in galactic bulges and disks , while wr stars , snii and snibc , formed in extremely young stellar populations , occur in active , or recent , galactic star - formation sites , such as spiral arms , molecular - cloud complexes , and galactic nuclei .",
    "thus in section 2 we briefly re - examine the production of @xmath55-decay positrons by galactic supernovae and their spatial and temporal distribution in the light of recent observations and theory .    in section 3",
    "we then explore in detail the expected energy loss , scattering , and propagation processes of the relativistic positrons from these supernovae in the different phases of the interstellar medium .",
    "we consider collisionless scattering of these positrons by small - scale fluctuations generated by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the ionized interstellar phases , based on extensive studies and observations of relativistic electrons in the analgous turbulence in the interplanetary medium . within this context",
    "we adopt a self - consistent transport model tied to field - aligned turbulence dependent on the properties of the ambient interstellar phases .    in sections 4 , 5 , and 6",
    "we determine the expected spatial distribution of positron production , propagation , slowing down and annihilation in the various phases of the positron bulge , disk and halo . in each of these we review the fundamental properties of the interstellar medium , which constrain positron transport as well as leave signatures in the positron annihilation line emission features . here",
    "we explore the very large differences between the interstellar properties , and the resulting positron propagation and annihilation , in the well - studied local interstellar medium compared to those in the inner @xmath1 1.5 kpc of our galaxy , where the diffuse 511 kev emission is most intense .",
    "finally , in sections 7 & 8 we give a summary and conclusions , comparing the expected 511 kev line emission with the spi / integral observations .",
    "we show that the observed spatial and spectral features of the galactic positron annihilation radiation can all be fully understood in the context of a supernova radionuclide origin , when the differential propagation of these @xmath1 mev positrons in the various phases of the interstellar medium is taken into consideration .",
    "here we briefly re - examine the production of positrons by @xmath55-decay radioactive nuclei produced by different types of galactic supernovae .",
    "we also re - examine the rates of such supernovae in the galaxy and the resulting spatial and temporal distribution of their production of positrons in both the galactic bulge and disk in the light of recent observations and theory , in order to determine the expected positron bulge / disk ratio of the such positron production , @xmath62 .",
    "positrons resulting from the decay chains of the longer - lived radioactive nuclei , @xmath59ni , @xmath60ti , @xmath57al , all produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae , have long been thought ( colgate 1970 ; burger , stephens & swanenburg 1970 ; clayton 1973 ; ramaty & lingenfelter 1979 ; chan & lingenfelter 1993 ; milne , the & leising 1999 ) to be the major source of galactic positrons .",
    "the total galactic positron production rates from these radionuclei depend on their supernova mass yields @xmath63 , the supernova occurrence rates @xmath64 and the survival fraction , @xmath65 , of their positrons in the supernova ejecta as it expands into the interstellar medium .",
    "the decay chain of @xmath59ni@xmath66@xmath59co@xmath66@xmath59fe produces a positron only 19% of the time , since @xmath59ni decays solely by electron capture with a mean life of 8.8 days into @xmath59co , which also decays primarily by electron capture , and just 19% by @xmath55 emission into @xmath59fe with a mean life of 111.4 days .",
    "thus the production rate of positrons from @xmath59co decay is @xmath67 , or @xmath68",
    "e@xmath46 s@xmath9 , where @xmath69 is the time - integrated survival fraction of @xmath59co decay positrons in the expanding supernova ejecta , @xmath70 is the production rate of @xmath59ni atoms per s , @xmath71 is the @xmath59ni yield in m@xmath72 per sn , and @xmath64 is the galactic supernova rate in sn per 100 yr .",
    "this galactic rate alone would greatly exceed the observed rate of positron annihilation , if all of the positrons escaped from the supernova ejecta , but most do not .",
    "the nucleosynthetic yields of @xmath59ni , whose decay energy powers the visible light from the exploding ejecta , have been extensively calculated in all different types of supernovae .",
    "this is particularly true of the cosmologically important type ia thermonuclear supernovae in accreting white dwarves , which are best described by the deflagration model w7 of nomoto , thielemann , & yoko ( 1984 ) that gives a @xmath59ni yield of 0.58 m@xmath72 .",
    "the peculiar subclass of type ia(bg ) , also called type ip , supernovae in accreting sub - chandrasakar white dwarves are expected to produce 0.44 m@xmath72 of @xmath59ni from the helium detonation model ( woosley , taam & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "because of the relatively short decay mean life of @xmath59co , most of these positrons lose their energy and annihilate in the ejecta before it becomes either thin enough for them to escape or sufficiently rarefied for them to survive .",
    "indeed , quantitative studies of the survival of positrons in the expanding supernova ejecta ( chan & lingenfelter 1993 ; milne , the & leising 1999 ) , for various supernova models , have shown that essentially all of the positrons produced by its decay in the most frequent , but massive , core collapse snii supernovae slow down and annihilate unobserved in their much denser ejecta and do not escape into the interstellar medium .",
    "in particular , chan & lingenfelter ( 1993 ) have calculated @xmath69 of positrons from @xmath59co decay expected for various supernova model distributions of the ejecta density , velocity and magnetic fields .",
    "they found that in the limit where the magnetic field is thoroughly tangled , the positron survival fraction for snia deflagration model , @xmath69 , ranged from 0.1% to 2.5% for unmixed versus uniformly mixed ejecta .",
    "alternatively in the limit that the magnetic field is fully combed - out ( e.g.  colgate , petschek & kriese 1980 ) the snia @xmath69 was much greater , ranging from 5% to 13% for unmixed and uniformly mixed ejecta . following this same procedure milne , the & leising ( 1999 )",
    "have further shown that a mean survival fraction @xmath73% for the deflagration model gave the best fits to snia light curves at late times ( @xmath31 yr ) , when the positrons from @xmath59co are the dominant source of energy . using the deflagration model ( nomoto , thielemann , & yoko 1984 ) @xmath59ni yield of 0.58 m@xmath72 , we calculate the expected positron production rate @xmath74 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 .      chan & lingenfelter ( 1993 ) have shown that the positrons from @xmath60ti@xmath66@xmath60sc@xmath66@xmath60ca decay , which produces a positron 95% of the time from @xmath55 emission of @xmath60sc to @xmath60ca , is a significant source of the annihilating positrons . the solar system abundance ratio of @xmath60ca to @xmath59fe of 1.23@xmath7510@xmath76 ( e.g.  lodders 2003 ) requires a similar relative nucleosynthetic yield ratio of @xmath60ti to @xmath59ni , since these radionuclei are the primary sources of @xmath60ca and @xmath59fe ( woosley & pinto 1988 ) .",
    "the much longer @xmath60ti decay mean life of 89 yr would allow essentially all ( @xmath3 97% ) of its positrons to survive in the expanding ejecta of even the most massive supernovae ( chan & lingenfelter 1993 ) . therefore the total galactic positron production rate from @xmath60ti decay can be scaled by the solar system abundance ratio of @xmath60ca to @xmath59fe , assuming that half of the galactic @xmath59fe is produced by snia ( e.g. timmes , woosley & weaver 1995 ) and @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 or @xmath79 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 .",
    "the most likely sources of these @xmath60ti decay positrons are the peculiar snip supernovae , typified by sn 1991bg ( filippenko et al .",
    "1992 ; turatto et al .",
    "1996 ) , so that we assume the same spatial distribution as snia .",
    "in particular , the primary source of galactic @xmath60ca appears to be he detonations in accreting sub - chandrasakar mass white dwarves , whose calculated ( woosley , taam & weaver 1986 ; woosley & weaver 1994 ) @xmath60ti yields of @xmath80 are @xmath1 16 times the solar system @xmath81 ratio . and such models also give the best fits to the light curves of these peculiar supernovae ( e.g. milne , the & leising 1999 ; blinnikov & sorokina 2004 ; the et al .",
    "the @xmath81 ratios calculated for other types of supernovae are much less than the solar system ratio .",
    "thus we assume the spatial distribution of the snip is the same as that of the snia and we also scale the @xmath60ti production to that of @xmath59ni in snia .",
    "the additional contribution of positrons , produced 82% of the time from long - lived ( @xmath82 yr ) decays of @xmath57al to @xmath57 mg , can be determined much more directly from the measured galactic luminosity of the 1.809 mev line , which accompanies that decay .",
    "this luminosity implies a steady - state galactic mass @xmath830.8 m@xmath84 of @xmath57al ( diehl et al .",
    "2006 ) , or a positron production @xmath85 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 .",
    "thus they can contribute @xmath1 15@xmath444% of the total galactic positron annihilation rate of @xmath86 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 inferred from the best - fit bulge , disk and halo annihilation luminosity discussed above .",
    "kndlseder ( 1999 ) has shown that the @xmath57al 1.809 mev line luminosity is strongly correlated with the distribution of massive stars in the disk , which confirms that it is produced in wolf rayet winds and/or in core collapse supernovae , snii and snib / c .",
    "with these calculated yields of @xmath59ni , @xmath60ti and @xmath57al in various types of supernovae , we now estimate the total galactic positron production rate from the decay of radionuclei synthesized in supernovae in the bulge and disk , assuming no significant production in the halo ,    @xmath87    scaled to the mean galactic occurrence rate , @xmath88 of snia supernovae per 100 yrs .",

    "it is also quite consistent with the mean value of @xmath102% inferred ( milne , the & leising 1999 ) from snia light curves at late times , when the positrons become a major source of ejecta heating .",
    "here we investigate both the _ stellar _ bulge / disk ratio ( @xmath103 ) of galactic supernovae and their radial and transverse distributions within the stellar bulge and disk . of primary concern",
    "are the snia and snip , which appear to be the source of @xmath1 85% of the annihilating positrons .",
    "we first determine the relative contributions of snia occurring in the galactic stellar bulge and disk .",
    "it is well known that the snia occurrence rate is essentially the same across the hubble sequence of galaxy types from ellipticals ( e ) through late - type spirals ( sd ) , when such rates are defined in snu , the number of supernovae per year per unit of blue luminosity of the parent galaxy ( e.g.  cappellaro , evans & turatto 1999 ) . across this broad hubble sequence ,",
    "the fraction of galactic blue - band luminosities contributed by galactic disks range from zero in ellipticals to 95% in late - type scd galaxies ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) , yet the snia birth rate per unit blue luminosity of parent galaxies remains the same .",
    "since the snia occurrence rates per blue luminosity is independent of the relative contributions of galactic bulges and disks , we scale the ratio of snia birthrates in the stellar bulge and disk of our galaxy by the corresponding ratio of stellar bulge to disk blue luminosities , @xmath104 . in their classic study simien & de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) investigated the systematics of bulge - to - disk ratios in the blue - band .",
    "the mean value of their tabulations of @xmath104 for our galaxy is 0.25 .",
    "thus , we expect that the galactic stellar luminosity bulge / disk ratio implies a similar time - averaged , mean stellar bulge / disk ratio @xmath105 0.25 for galactic snia and snip . adding the star burst contribution of 0.025 snia per 100 years in the bulge , which is a 30% enhancement over the mean bulge rate of 0.08 snia per 100 years , gives a current stellar galactic bulge / disk ratio @xmath106 0.33 for snia and snip supernovae",
    ".    to model the spatial distribution of snia in the galaxy , we use the representations of dehnen & binney ( 1998 ) who parameterized the large - scale stellar distributions within the galaxy by comparing models to the galactic rotational and other observational constraints .",

    "they concluded that the most important model parameter was the ratio of the disk scale length , @xmath118 , to @xmath119 , the distance of the sun from the galactic center .",
    "they found that the observational constraints were best satisfied by any of four models with @xmath119 = 8 kpc and @xmath120 of 0.25 , 0.3 , 0.35 , & 0.4 . here",

    "although the great majority of massive stars , which synthesize @xmath57al , are located in the outer ( @xmath3 3.5 kpc ) galactic disk ( mckee & williams 1997 ) , some massive stars found in the inner ( @xmath0 0.2 kpc ) stellar bulge . since galactic lyman continuum radiation is also produced by a massive star population ( e.g. mckee & williams 1997 ) , we use the ratio of lyman continuum radiation emitted by the inner stellar bulge to that from the outer disk to estimate the corresponding @xmath57al ratio .",
    "gsten ( 1989 ) estimated a luminosity of ionizing photons from massive stars in the inner bulge of @xmath127 photons s@xmath9 .",
    "comparing this to the estimated ( mckee & williams 1997 ) total galactic value of @xmath128 photons s@xmath9 , we expect that roughly 10% of the massive stars and their generated @xmath57al occur in the inner bulge , amounting to @xmath129 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 .    for the remaining disk portion",

    "as we see from figure 2 , of the positrons produced from snia and snip in the disk , 13% are born within 1.5 kpc . although the best fit disk model used in the spi / integral analyses ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "2007 , 2008a ) of the annihilation radiation also includes 12% occurring within that radius , in order to treat the propagation of the positrons before the annihilate , we obviously need to include them in the total production within 1.5 kpc .",
    "once we have determined the distribution of the subsequent annihilation of all of the positrons , we then adjust the estimated bulge ( @xmath0 1.5 kpc ) and disk ( @xmath3 1.5 kpc ) annihilation luminosities to compare with the spi / integral bulge and disk components , as we discuss in section 7 .",
    "therefore , the positron bulge production ( @xmath0 1.5 kpc ) , @xmath135q_{b+d } \\sim [ 0.21 +   0.64(0.13 ) + 0.1(0.15)]q_{b+d } \\sim 0.31 q_{b+d}$ ] , and the disk production , including the ob contribution , @xmath136q_{b+d } \\sim [ 0.64(0.87 ) +   0.9(0.15)]q_{b+d } \\sim 0.69 q_{b+d}$ ] .",
    "thus the effective positron production ratio in the bulge and disk within and beyond 1.5 kpc is @xmath137 0.45 .    from the ratio of positron production rates in the bulge @xmath138 and disk @xmath139 we now determine the differential propagation of the positrons within and between those regions and the halo before they annihilate . in simplest terms we define the resulting positron bulge / disk annihilation ratio as , @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are respectively the fractions of the positrons , born in the bulge @xmath143 and disk @xmath144 beyond 1.5 kpc , which annihilate in the positron bulge @xmath145 kpc , while @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the corresponding fractions of those positrons which annihilate in the disk @xmath144 beyond the positron bulge @xmath148 kpc .",

    "the expected ( chan & lingenfelter 1993 ; milne , the & leising 1999 ) mean energy of the escaping positrons from the shorter - lived ( 111.4 day mean life ) decay of @xmath59co is close to 0.5 mev , reduced from their initial energy by ionization losses in the still dense ejecta , while the mean energy of those from the longer lived ( 89 yr @xmath60ti dominated meanlife ) decay of @xmath60sc is essentially unchanged at about 0.6 mev in the much less dense ejecta .",
    "the mean energy of positrons from the decay of the very long - lived ( 1.04@xmath7510@xmath94 yr ) decay of @xmath57al is likewise about 0.5 mev .    in order for these surviving relativistic positrons to annihilate in the interstellar medium they must first be _ decelerated to energies , @xmath2 10 ev . _ in order to slow down to thermal energies , these @xmath1 0.5 mev positrons , must run through @xmath1 0.12 g @xmath14 ( berger & seltzer 1964 ) , or @xmath150 h @xmath14 , in unionized interstellar gas , and this range is reduced by a factor of @xmath151 if the gas is ionized with an ionization fraction , @xmath152 , relying solely on collisional ionization losses . in the process of traveling this slowing down distance , @xmath153 kpc , the average velocity of these positrons ,",
    "@xmath154 is @xmath1 0.7 of the velocity of light , so their slowing down time ,    @xmath155    where @xmath156 is the mean h density in cm@xmath76 .",
    "thus we see that since the slowing down distance of the radioactive decay positrons in the nominal phases of the interstellar medium is @xmath3 0.5 kpc in hi clouds with typical @xmath158 40 cm@xmath76 , @xmath3 50 kpc in warm media with typical @xmath158 0.4 cm@xmath76 , and @xmath3 3 mpc in hot phases with typical @xmath159 cm@xmath76 .",
    "since all of these distances are far greater than the scales of their corresponding interstellar components , these fast positrons , streaming along the large - scale interstellar magnetic field , would all escape the galactic disk before they even slow down , _ unless there is sufficient plasma turbulence to efficiently isotropize their trajectories .",
    "_ we thus investigate in detail under what conditions the interstellar turbulence can isotropize the trajectories of these relativistic positrons .      in ionized interstellar phases we expect that the interstellar mev positrons are scattered by resonant interactions with ambient turbulent magnetic fluctuations .",
    "consequently , the efficiency of these scatterings in turn depends on the fundamental properties of the mhd turbulence at very small spatial scales of the electron gyroradius , @xmath160",
    ". however , the basic properties of mhd turbulence is poorly understood . in a recent review of turbulence and magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas , schekochihin & cowley ( 2007 ) state  despite over fifty years of research and many major advances a satisfactory theory of mhd turbulence remains elusive .",
    "indeed , even the simplest ( most idealized ) cases are not fully understood . \"",
    "an important advancement was the realization that in many astrophysical sites mhd turbulence is anisotropic .",

    "they presented the concept of  critical balance \" which predicted in inertial regime of turbulent mhd flows , first , a filamentary shape for turbulent fluctuations , via a relationship between the wave numbers parallel ( @xmath161 ) and transverse ( @xmath162 ) to the direction of the local mean magnetic field , k@xmath163 k@xmath164 and , second , the modeled energy spectra of transverse turbulent components possesses kolmogorov ( 1941 ) scaling , @xmath165 , observed in low - speed , terrestrial flows .    at present , a puzzling dichotomy exists between these model predictions and a plethora of solar - wind observations and numerical simulations .",
    "power spectra of small scale electromagnetic fluctuations in solar - wind plasmas have been found to have the expected @xmath1665/3 spectral index ( e.g. horbury et al .",
    "1996 ; leamon et al .  1998 ; bale et al .",

    "unfortunately , analyses of single spacecraft measurements are unable to determine the full modal three - dimensional wavevector spectra of turbulent fluctuations ( e.g. horbury , forman , & oughton 2005 ) and thus can not confirm or refute the critical balance prediction about filamentary - shaped fluctuations ( beresnyak & lazarian 2008 ) .",
    "although much progress has been made in the understanding and modeling of anisotropic mhd turbulence , such models , which assume that the frequency of the turbulent fluctuations is low compared to the proton gyrofrequency @xmath167 , still have difficulty in representing high - frequency collisionless turbulence evolving on frequencies , @xmath168 , which seem to be most efficient at resonantly scattering @xmath1 mev positrons , where @xmath169 represents electron gyrofrequency .",
    "the application of such models of anisotropic turbulence seems to imply that collisionless scattering of mev electrons would be modest and mev electron transport should be dominated by streaming at @xmath170 .",
    "yet a great variety of independent investigations of mev electron transport in the interplanetary medium irrefutably demonstrate that such particles propagate @xmath171 in the collisionless solar wind plasma , although the nature of the plasma fluctuations which actually scatter such electrons remains yet unknown .",
    "thus , we employ a simple phenomenological model of collisionless mev electron scarttering by turbulent interstellar fluctuations tied heavily to the well determined properties of electron scattering in turbulent solar - wind plasmas .",
    "the propagation of mev electrons has been well studied in the interplanetary medium employing measurements of electrons accelerated by solar particle events as well as by the jovian magnetosphere .",
    "the propagation of jovian mev electrons is , for the most part , dominated by diffusion ( ferreira et al .  2001a , b , 2003 ) .",
    "fits to intensity and anisotropy time profiles of solar - flare electrons also illustrate the dominance of diffusive transport at these electron energies , and , consequently , lead to the straightforward determination of scattering mean free paths via fits to intensity and anisotropy time profiles ( kallenrode 1993 ) .",
    "bieber , wanner , & matthaeus ( 1996 ) related such phenomenologically - derived scattering mean free paths from solar flare particle measurements to the determination of @xmath172 power spectra of magnetic fluctuations at mhd spatial scales . since it is impossible to determine the full three - dimensional wavevector spectra of turbulent fluctuation from single spacecraft measurements ( e.g.  fredricks & coroniti 1976 ) , bieber , wanner , & matthaeus employed a simple two - component representation of the anisotropic interplanetary mhd turbulence .",
    "they found that their magnetic - field data consisted of two anisotropic populations , fluctuations with large correlation lengths transverse to the direction of the mean magnetic field ( slab turbulence ) and fluctuations with large correlation lengths parallel to the direction of the mean magnetic field ( quasi - two - dimensional turbulence ) .",
    "in such slab models the wave vectors of the fluctuations are aligned parallel to the direction of the mean magnetic field , and a simple interpretation is that in the inertial range slab turbulence consists of alfvn wave propagating along the mean magnetic field .",
    "later investigations ( oughton , dmitruk , & matthaeus 2004 , 2006 ; oughton & matthaeus 2005 ) have demonstrated that this simple two - component model of anisotropic turbulence seems to model the basic properties of solar wind mhd turbulence .",
    "bieber , wanner , & matthaeus found that interplanetary turbulence is dominated by quasi - two - dimensional turbulence , and the mean ratio of the power in slab turbulence to the power in two - dimensional turbulence is @xmath10.15 .",
    "further , observing that the modeled two - dimensional fluctuations do not contribute to particle scatterings , they calculated scattering mean free paths expected by resonant interactions solely with turbulent slab fluctuations via quasi - linear theory ( jokipii 1969 ) .",
    "they found that such scattering mean free paths agreed well with the values determined independently ( of the analyses of the turbulent magnetic variations ) from data fits to intensity and anisotropy time profiles .",
    "based on these discussions , we model _",
    "interstellar _ mhd turbulence as composite slab / two - dimensional turbulence .",
    "we assume here that the ratio of the power of interstellar slab turbulence along the mean magnetic field to the power of 2-dimensional turbulence normal to the direction of the mean field is 0.15 following bieber et al .",

    "thus , by such one - dimensional ( 1-d ) diffusion the positrons in their slowing down time @xmath196 would be distributed along a flux tube a mean length @xmath197 in either direction from their point of origin .",
    "the bulk of the galactic interstellar mass resides in primarily neutral phases ( hi & h@xmath198 ) , concentrated in a cloud population ( e.g. tielens 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , a major fraction of the disk ( @xmath3 3.5 kpc ) is filled with warm neutral hi ( kulkarni & heiles 1987 ) .",
    "consequently , the nature of mhd turbulence in predominantly neutral interstellar phases needs to be addressed .    in partially neutral plasmas , where magnetic forces act directly on charges , and indirectly on neutral atoms via ion - neutral collisions ,",
    "the turbulent nhd fluctuations are dissipated into heat when ion and neutral velocities differ significantly ( higdon 1984 ; goldreich & sridhar 1995 ; lithwick & goldreich 2001 ) .",
    "turbulent mhd cascades are quenched at scales of roughly the collision mean free path of protons with neutral atoms , if the proton collision rate with neutral atoms exceeds the eddy cascade rate .",
    "the mean free path for proton - hi collisions is @xmath199 cm at 8000 k , or if hydrogen is fully ionized , and he is the dominant neutral species , the mean free path for proton - he collisions is @xmath200 cm where @xmath156 is the h number density , including both ions and neutrals ( lithwick & goldreich 2001 ) .",
    "consequently , they showed that mhd turbulence can cascade to small spatial scales , much less than these damping collision mean free paths , only if the hi fraction , @xmath201 , is less than a critical value ,    @xmath202    therefore in predominantly neutral interstellar phases turbulent mhd cascades are halted by ion - neutral collisions at @xmath203 , spatial scales far greater than the gyroradii of mev positrons .",
    "hence we expect collisionless scattering of positrons by such large - scale turbulent mhd fluctuations to be very inefficient .",
    "similarly simple elastic collisions with ambient electrons , whose mean pitch angle scattering is 90@xmath23 and mean energy loss is 50% , have a mean free path much longer than slowing down distance due to ionization losses ( e.g. berger & seltzer 1964 ) , so they too offer no significant scattering .    in the absence of such scatterings , @xmath1mev positrons might be expected to generate plasma waves by a resonant streaming instability , similar to the creation ( kulsrud 2005 ) of ion alfvn waves by streaming relativistic cosmic ray nuclei .",
    "but these do not appear to be effective either .",
    "these @xmath1 mev positrons generate resonant whistler waves ( schlickeiser 2002 ) at wavelengths significantly less than the scale of the thermal proton gyroradius , @xmath204 , at frequencies approaching those of thermal electrons , @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the thermal proton speed .",
    "the phase speed of whistler waves in the direction of the mean field is the _ electron _ alfvn speed , @xmath207 if the positron streaming velocity , @xmath208 , and if the whistler waves were nt damped so they grew to saturation , then the resulting magnetic field fluctuations in these waves would interact with the streaming positrons via quasi - linear wave - particle interactions that change their pitch angles , reducing @xmath209 to a level just less than @xmath210 .",
    "however , in predominantly neutral interstellar phases such whistler waves are also subject to severe ion - neutral damping ( kennel 2008 private communication ) .",
    "thus , we expect that positron streaming velocities along the magnetic flux tubes are comparable to their particle velocities , @xmath211 , similar to the very high drift speeds found ( felice & kulsrud 2001 ) for cosmic - ray nuclei in warm hi regions .",
    "nonetheless , in turbulent media the flux tubes themselves may essentially random walk , so that the propagation is described by so - called  compound diffusion \" ( lingenfelter , ramaty & fisk 1971 ) .",
    "using these models of relativistic electron transport , we now investigate the propagation , slowing down , and annihilation of positrons produced in each of the different phases of the interstellar medium in the positron bulge , galactic disk and halo .",
    "the schematic model of the bulge , disk and halo is shown in figure 1 . because the positrons , produced by snia and snip , are widely distributed in the bulge and disk ( equation 3 ) , we assume that the fraction produced in the various phases of the interstellar medium are proportional to their appropriate filling factors .",

    "although we have also made monte carlo simulations , we estimate the propagation of positrons during their slowing down in each phase of the interstellar medium , using a simple approximation .",
    "since even the average properties and structure of the magnetic field especially are very poorly known in the various phases , no more sophisticated treatment seems justified . for the 1-d diffusion in a uniform medium with a mean free path @xmath212 along a magnetic flux tube",
    ", @xmath213 positrons produced at a point , @xmath214 = 0 and @xmath215 = 0 , will be distributed in both directions along the flux tube with a density , @xmath216 , where @xmath217 , by the time @xmath196 that they slow down and annihilate .",
    "this corresponds to a mean positron density @xmath218 over the total mean length @xmath219 .",

    "thus , if the positrons are produced uniformly along some mean length @xmath222 of the magnetic flux tubes threading through some phase @xmath223 , from the above we expect that the probability , @xmath224 , that such positrons will slow down and annihilate in that phase before they escape is crudely ,    @xmath225    where @xmath226 is the slowing down length in that phase .",
    "the remaining positrons have a probability , @xmath227 , of escaping from phase @xmath223 into a neighboring phase , and we estimate the relative fractions of the escaping positrons that go into each of the adjacent phases from simple geometric arguments , allowing large uncertainties of @xmath44 50% .    the probability that positrons which diffuse into a phase @xmath223 will slow down and annihilate there is only slightly different from those born uniformly within it .",

    "we need to separate the positron production and annihilation in the bulge and disk into five regions , shown in figure 1 , defined primarily by their galacto - centic radius , although they also have very different mixes of interstellar phases , as recently reviewed by ferrire , gillard & jean ( 2007 ) . these are 1 ) the very hot , dense inner or nuclear bulge , @xmath235 , ( @xmath0 0.5 kpc ) ; 2 ) the hot , middle bulge and tilted disk , @xmath236 ( 0.5 to 1.5 kpc ) ; 3 ) the hot , tenuous outer bulge , @xmath237 between @xmath1 1.5 kpc and the galactic molecular ring at around @xmath1 3.5 kpc , dominated by the bulge wind ( e.g. bregman 1980 ; blitz et al . 1993 ) ; 4 ) the predominantly warm neutral outer disk beyond 3.5 kpc , @xmath238 , and 5 ) the hot , tenuous halo , @xmath239 , beyond 3.5 kpc and above the disk . the properties of each of these regions , which we discuss below , are summarized in tables 1 and 2 .    based on the distributions of the surface density of the three positron source components , given in equation ( 3 ) : the bulge and disk distributions of snia and snip occurrences , and the disk distribution of massive ( ob ) stars ( mckee & williams 1997 ) , we estimated the fraction of positron production in each of these regions .",
    "the cumulative production as a function of galactic radius is shown in figure 2 for each component .",
    "we find that 45% , 38% and 17% of the positrons from the stellar bulge @xmath240 component of snia and snip are produced in the regions @xmath0 0.5 kpc , 0.5 to 1.5 kpc , and 1.5 to 3.5 kpc , respectively , plus 10% of the massive star @xmath57al component within 0.5 kpc . of the positrons from the stellar disk @xmath241 component of snia and snip , 2% , 11% and 30%",

    "outside of galactic centers , ultraviolet radiation flux at an arbitrary location in galactic nuclear regions is generated by nearby ob associations , or by single o stars distributed randomly throughout the regions ( wolfire , tielens , & hollenbach 1990 ) .",

    "the extent of such irradiation is not known , however , and here we arbitrarily assume that it extends only to 0.5 kpc .",
    "we also assume that the magnetic flux tubes nominally pass through the cold clouds in a parallel array , but with large turbulent perturbations superimposed , as suggested by magnetic field in giant molecular clouds .",
    "li et al . ( 2006 ) , using the sparo 450 @xmath265 m polarimetry observations , have found that within some such clouds in the disk , the direction of the magnetic field is roughly correlated with that of the local galactic field .",

    "thus , we assume a nominal field to calculate the base mean length of flux tubes through the clouds , and then from an estimate of the scale length of turbulent motions , we estimate the increase of that mean length resulting from the effective random walk or meandering of the flux tubes through the turbulent perturbations . the nominal mean flux tube length through cold cloud cores is @xmath266 , where @xmath122 is the core radius , while the nominal mean length through an overlying shell of thickness @xmath267 , is @xmath268/(r + \\delta r)^2 $ ] . conservatively taking the outer scale of turbulent motion @xmath175 as the step size , which minimizes the random walk , we expect a mean meandering flux tube length , @xmath269 .    in the inner bulge",

    "similarly , the large line widths observed in the extended hii gases in the galactic center region ( e.g.  rodriguez - fernandez & martin - pintado 2005 ) imply that turbulence also dominates the hii pressure .",

    "they also suggest that less than 2% of the positrons escape beyond the bulge ( @xmath3 1.5 kpc ) , since they tend to be reflected , because the scattering mean free path there is much shorter and the slowing down time is much longer , so there is little likelihood of their slowing down and annihilating there before they diffuse back out and eventually diffuse into the hii below .",
    "although , as we discussed above , about half of the positrons entering the turbulent hii envelopes are also reflected , because of the closeness of clouds , positrons escaping from one cloud envelope quickly enter another , so after just half a dozen cloud encounters nearly all have slowed down and annihilated in the hii .",

    "thus , we might expect that much of emission from positron annihilation in the tilted disk would not have been counted as part of the modeled thick planar disk fitted from the spi / integral data and would instead have been counted as part of their modeled extended spherical bulge from which it is essentially indistinguishable .",
    "here we model the interstellar phenomena of this outer portion of the tilted interstellar gas disk , again assuming that a hot tenuous plasma permeates the region , pressure equilibrium exists among all the interstellar phases , magnetic pressure is in equilibrium with gas thermal pressure , and the properties of the hi , and h@xmath53 regions are related to each other via the pdr scenario .",

    "thus , the median distance from positron sources in the hm to the labyrinth of hi cloud envelopes in the disk is @xmath1 0.5 kpc for both populations . with the roughly vertical magnetic field in that region ( e.g. beck 2001 ) ,",
    "the positrons are born along flux tubes above and below the disk with a mean length @xmath347 1 kpc , twice the median value .",

    "thus as we saw with the vh , we expect from equation ( 8) that the fraction of positrons born in the hm and slowed down and annihilated there , @xmath404 0.07 .",
    "as monte carlo simulations also suggested with the vh , only a few percent of the positrons are likely to escape into the tenuous region above 1.5 kpc , while the bulk ( @xmath1 91% ) diffuse into the cloudy labyrinths of both the tilted disk and the cmz below .",
    "there due to the closeness of nearby clouds within these disks , essentially all of the positrons from the hm that enter these two labyrinths rapidly diffuse on into the turbulent outer envelopes of clouds where they slow down and annihilate .",
    "we further estimate that the relative fractions of positrons born in the middle bulge that enter into the labyrinth of clouds in the outer tilted disk and annihilate in their hi envelopes , compared to those that escape down into the inner bulge and enter into the labyrinth of clouds in the cmz and inner tilted disk and annihilate in their hii envelopes , are proportional to the relative surface areas of the two disks , or about 75% to 25% , respectively .",

    "but because of the negligible filling factors of these cloud cores , no significant positron production should occur within them , and we show that essentially all of the positrons born elsewhere are expected to slow down and annihilate in the overlying hi envelopes before they can get into the h@xmath53 cores .    in the overlying hi envelopes between the cold h@xmath53 cloud cores and the hot hm plasma , we assume a mean density of @xmath409 h cm@xmath76 at a temperature @xmath302 100 k , giving it thickness @xmath378 1 pc , as discussed above .",
    "therefore the positron slowing down time in the hi , @xmath196 is @xmath1 90 yr from equation ( 5 ) , and since the mhd cascade is also damped by ion - neutral friction , the isotropic streaming positrons are distributed along a flux tube over a mean length @xmath410 9 pc in both directions in their slowing down time .",

    "these positrons are all effectively born within a scattering mean free path of the surface .",
    "thus , since @xmath414 , we expect also that @xmath1 0.5 slow down an annihilate in the hi , before they can penetrate into the h@xmath53 cores below , and the remainder escape back into the hm above . there , again because of the close proximity of the clouds , the escaping positrons quickly diffuse into another hi envelope , where the process is repeated , and soon virtually all are slowed down and annihilated in the hi",

    "although the density of the hi envelopes are quite uncertain , the expectation that they are thick enough to slow down and annihilate the positrons is rather robust .",
    "that results from the fact that the thickness of the hi and the slowing down length are both inversely proportional to the density , because the column depth of the hi , which shields the h@xmath53 from dissociation , is fixed and so is the required column depth for the slowing down .",

    "we further found ( higdon & lingenfelter 2005 ) that the majority ( @xmath1 85% ) of core - collapse supernovae ( snii & snib / c ) occur in superbubbles and an additional fraction ( @xmath1 20% ) of the snia and snip occur there randomly with a probability equal to the superbubble filling factor .",

    ", we expect that the positron annihilation in the disk occurs almost entirely in the warm ionized hii and wi phases , which are concentrated along the spiral arms ( e.g. drimmel & spergel 2001 ) .",

    "the total galactic production rate of positrons from long lived ( 1.04 myr meanlife ) decay of @xmath57al of @xmath582 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 , produced by massive stars , is determined directly from the spi / integral measurements ( diehl et al .",

    "the galactic positron production from the much shorter lived ( 111.4 day meanlife ) decay chain @xmath59ni , however , depends on an additional factor , since most of these decay positrons slow down and annihilate in the dense ejecta and only a fraction , @xmath69 survive into the interstellar medium .",

    "we then estimated the relative fractions of the escaping positrons that go into each of the adjacent phases by simple geometric arguments .",

    "some segments of these flux tubes thread through the warm ionized gas and hii shells that separate the warm neutral gas from the hot tenuous plasmas , while other segments have been blown up into the halo by the hot expanding superbubbles ( e.g. parker 1979 ) , and , since there is no preferred direction , the positrons diffusing or streaming along them should have roughly equal likelihood of either going into the warm denser ionized shells , where they mostly slow down and annihilate , or out into the halo . from the estimated propagation fractions , assuming large uncertainties",
    ", we find that nearly half of the positrons enter the ionized shells and annihilate in the disk , and that other half escape into the overlying halo , giving a total annihilation rate in the disk beyond 3.5 kpc is @xmath594 e@xmath46 s@xmath9 .",

    "( 2006 ) have shown and we list in table 6 , if the refractory elements in the hot plasma are all in dust grains , only @xmath1 18% of the positron annihilation occurs via positronium formation , and fully @xmath1 90% of the 511 kev line emission is narrow with a fwhm @xmath1 2 kev , while the remaining 10% is very broad ( fwhm @xmath1 11 kev ) .",
    "this gives a halo flux of @xmath665 @xmath14 s@xmath9 in the narrow line alone .",
    "that in turn gives a combined bulge and halo flux of @xmath666 @xmath14 s@xmath9 , which is quite consistent with that from the spi / integral best fit flux of @xmath597 @xmath14 s@xmath9 ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "2008a ) , see table 7 . combined with disk flux , that would give a total galactic bulge , disk and halo flux of @xmath568 @xmath14 s@xmath9 which is also quite consistent with the combined best - fit flux of @xmath569 @xmath14 s@xmath9 , from the spi / integral analyses .",
    "this also gives galactic average values of the positronium fraction of only @xmath667 and the broad / narrow 511 kev line flux ratio of only @xmath571 , for which the best - fit spi / integral values have not yet been published .",
    "if on the other hand , the grains have all disintegrated , the halo flux would still be almost as large , @xmath572 @xmath14 s@xmath9 , but it would all be in the very wide ( @xmath1 11 kev ) 511 kev line , so the galactic average value of the broad / narrow 511 kev line flux ratio would jump to @xmath573 , and the positronium fraction would increase only slightly to @xmath574 .",
    "the actual dust content of the halo undoubtedly lies in between and _ since we expect the broad / narrow 511 kev line ratio from the halo beyond 1.5 kpc to be extremely sensitive , ranging from @xmath1 0.1 to @xmath668 , spi / integral measurements of that ratio should provide a unique measure of the halo dust . _",
    "in conclusion , we find that roughly half of the galactic positrons from supernova generated radionuclei are produced in he bulge and inner disk within the stellar bulge of @xmath669 kpc , and half in the stellar disk beyond that .",
    "essentially all of the bulge positrons are produced in the very hot plasma , through which they diffuse with a calculated mean free path of only 1% of the size of the region .",
    "therefore , before they can either slow down and annihilate in the plasma or escape beyond , most of them are stopped and annihilate in the very dense ( @xmath1100 - 1000 h cm@xmath9 ) warm outer shells of the molecular clouds that lie within @xmath671 1.5 kpc .",
    "the disk positrons , on the other hand , are produced about equally in the warm hi gas and the hot superbubbles , which blow out into the halo .",
    "we calculate that roughly half of the disk positrons , which either stream through the low density ( @xmath10.1 h cm@xmath9 ) neutral hi at close to @xmath187 , or diffuse through the hot superbubble plasma , escape into the overlying halo before they can stop and annihilate in the low density ( 0.3 - 3 h cm@xmath9 ) photoionized outer shells of clouds and superbubbles in the disk .",
    "thus , positron propagation easily explains the larger annihilation flux from the bulge .",
    "moreover , it explains the high observed postronium fraction and narrow observed 511 kev line width , that both require annihilation predominantly in the warm ionized gas and not in the hot plasma in which nearly all of the positrons are produced , either in this or in other suggested sources .",
    "we expect these conclusions to be quite robust , since they are based on 1 ) extensive observations of galactic supernova rates and distributions , 2 ) observationally confirmed models of supernova yields of radionuclei and their decay - positron survival fractions , 3 ) wide ranging observations of the properties and distributions of the various phases of the interstellar medium and magnetic fields , and 4 ) the widely used photodissociation region ( pdr ) models of molecular cloud shells . from these",
    "we have calculated the expected propagation of positrons in the various phases , assuming streaming in the neutral phases and diffusion in the ionized gas and plasma phases , using diffusion mean free paths in the latter phases calculated from a two - component , phenomenological model of anisotropic turbulence , which is consistent with observations of particle propagation in our best natural laboratory , the interplanetary medium .    thus , as we show in table 7 , when positron propagation is considered , the positrons from the @xmath55-decay chains of the radioactive nuclei , @xmath59ni , @xmath60ti , and @xmath57al , produced in galactic supernovae , can fully account for _ all _ of the features of the diffuse galactic 511 kev and 3-@xmath36 continuum annihilation radiation observed by spi / integral .",
    "_ we have also predicted additional measurable features that can not only further test such an origin of the positrons but provide new information on the nature of the interstellar medium . _",
