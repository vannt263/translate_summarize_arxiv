    "a sizable fraction of the main sequence a and b stars are observed to be strongly magnetic , with typical surface field strengths between a few hundred g and more than 30  kg @xcite . unlike the active late - type stars , in which tangled magnetic topologies are generated by a contemporary dynamo involving differential rotation and turbulence",
    ", the early - type stars most likely acquire their magnetic fields in the process of star formation and then retain them during the main sequence evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . to maintain stability",
    ", these fossil fields must have a mixed poloidal - toroidal geometry in the stellar interior @xcite , but at the surface the fields are expected to be essentially poloidal , with the dipolar contribution dominating the field geometry .",
    "observations of the mean line of sight magnetic component , the so - called longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath1 , generally reveal a smooth , single - wave variation with the stellar rotation @xcite , consistent with a simple , dipolar - like structure of the magnetic field topologies in the early - type stars .",
    "recent comprehensive investigations of the linear and circular polarization spectra suggested the presence of small - scale magnetic field structures in some chemically peculiar a - type stars @xcite . at the same time , these studies still found a dipolar - like large - scale field organization , just as one would expect from simple @xmath1  curves of these stars .",
    "only a few early - type stars show longitudinal magnetic field variation deviating significantly from a single - wave sinusoid .",
    "these stars , hd37776  @xcite , hd32633 @xcite , hd133880 @xcite , hd137509 @xcite , and @xmath2  sco @xcite , attracted considerable attention because even a relatively small distortion of the @xmath1  phase curve indicates a dominant higher - order multipolar field component .",
    "this challenges theoretical models to find a satisfactory explanation for the existence and apparent stability of these rare global stellar magnetic field topologies .",
    "in this context , investigations of unusual non - dipolar fields represent an important step towards achieving a more complete theoretical understanding of the hot - star magnetism .    among the stars with conspicuously non - dipolar longitudinal magnetic field variation ,",
    "hd37776  ( hip26742 , v901  ori ) has the most bizzare @xmath1  curve .",
    "this young he - strong b2iv star belongs to the orion ob1b association @xcite and shows a prominent rotational variation of the brightness in different photometric bands @xcite , spectral line intensities @xcite , and flux distribution @xcite due to the combined effect of a strong magnetic field and an inhomogeneous distribution of chemical elements over the stellar surface .",
    "uniquely for an early - type star , its longitudinal magnetic field curve shows four well - defined extrema during each rotation cycle .    a consistent rotational period of @xmath3  d follows from the variation of the longitudinal magnetic field @xcite , the strength of the neutral he lines @xcite , and multi - color photometry @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented a combined analysis of different time - series observations obtained for hd37776  over 31 years .",
    "they reported a remarkably rapid rotational spin down by 17.7  s during this period .",
    "the first quantitative model aiming to explain the puzzling longitudinal magnetic field curve of hd37776  was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1  measurements were reproduced with an axisymmetric combination of the dipolar , quadrupolar and octupolar magnetic components with the strengths 3.4 , @xmath4 , and 44  kg respectively .",
    "the resulting mean surface magnetic field strength exceeds the 34  kg field intensity measured for babcock s star @xcite , making hd37776  the most magnetized object among all non - degenerate stars .",
    "however , this conclusion is sensitive to the adopted parameterization of the field geometry and assumed inclination of the stellar rotational axis .",
    "the very large predicted field strength can not be confirmed by direct detection of the zeeman splitting of spectral lines due to the rapid rotation of hd37776 .",
    "@xcite derived magnetic field geometry and surface maps of chemical elements for hd37776  with the help of the doppler - zeeman imaging technique .",
    "the magnetic field structure was approximated by a superposition of non - aligned dipole and quadrupole components .",
    "the study employed a simplified treatment of the line formation in a magnetic field and was based on the circular polarization spectra with a sparse phase coverage . despite these shortcomings , the theoretical @xmath5 light curves calculated for the surface abundance distributions of @xcite fit the observations very well @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", no definite magnetic field model could be found in @xcite study , with lines of different elements giving @xmath680  kg , @xmath7160  kg , and different orientations of the magnetic axes .",
    "none of these models succeeded in reproducing the observed longitudinal magnetic field curve .",
    "the inconclusive results of the previous magnetic field studies of hd37776  and the lack of a definite magnetic field geometry model compatible with different types of magnetic observations warrants a new investigation of this unique star . in this paper , we present a new analysis of the magnetic field topology of hd37776  using all magnetic field observations available for this star . in section  [ obs ] , we describe the longitudinal magnetic field measurements and time - resolved spectropolarimetric observations employed in our analysis .",
    "sections  [ multipolar ] and [ mdi ] provide a description of the multipolar and doppler imaging modeling of the magnetic observations .",
    "in section  [ 3dfld ] we study the magnetospheric structure of hd37776  using potential field extrapolation .",
    "the paper concludes with the discussion of our results in section  [ disc ] .",
    "a strong longitudinal magnetic field in hd37776  was found by @xcite .",
    "their seven @xmath1  measurements showed the presence of a kg - strength variable magnetic field , which exhibits a peculiar double - wave modulation with rotation phase .",
    "longitudinal magnetic field measurements of hd37776  were continued by @xcite .",
    "all these observations were carried out using a photopolarimetric zeeman analyzer , tuned to the wings of the h@xmath8 line . in total , 44 photopolarimetric @xmath1  measurements were collected in 19771978 and in 19821984 , spanning the range from @xmath9 to @xmath10  kg with a typical uncertainty of 300400  g.    in 1993 , five additional spectropolarimetric longitudinal field measurements were obtained for hd37776  by @xcite .",
    "these authors derived the line of sight magnetic field component from a mean stokes @xmath11 profile of 17 metal absorption lines .",
    "the errors of these measurements are 170360  g. despite being of a rather different nature compared to the h@xmath8 photopolarimetric longitudinal field diagnostic , the @xmath1  data points published by @xcite agree well with the previously established longitudinal field phase curve . taking this into account , we combined the photo- and spectropolarimetric @xmath1  determinations in the analysis presented below .",
    "we recalculated the rotation phases of the longitudinal magnetic field measurements using the cubic ephemeris of @xcite , which takes into account the rapid rotational braking of hd37776 .",
    "the updated longitudinal magnetic field curve is presented in figure  [ fig : bz ] . in this plot",
    "the phase 0.0 corresponds to the maximum brightness of the star .",
    "the application of the non - linear ephemeris yields a slightly larger scatter of the @xmath1  measurements at close rotation phases compared to the constant period of , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the overall distorted double - wave structure of the longitudinal field curve , as well as satisfactory agreement between the observations by @xcite and @xcite obtained a decade apart , is retained .",
    "an intensive spectropolarimetric observing campaign of hd37776  took place in 19941996 at the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( sao ) .",
    "the star was observed in different wavelength bands with the main stellar spectrograph ( mss ) equipped with a ccd detector and an achromatic circular polarization analyzer .",
    "observations of hd37776  employed the second camera of the mss , giving the effective spectral range of 50007000    and a dispersion of 14   / mm . from october 1994 to 1996 spectra were recorded using a @xmath12 pixel detector , while a @xmath13 ccd was used after march 1996 .",
    "both detectors provide a spectral resolution of @xmath14 , which is adequate for the analysis of rapid rotators such as hd37776 .",
    "thar lamp was used as a comparison source .",
    "the instrumental profile is close to a gaussian with 22.5 pixel sampling of the fwhm .",
    "the extraction of the mss zeeman spectrograms was accomplished with the reduction package dech20 by g. galazutdinov .",
    "this software was also used to perform continuum normalization and to determine the wavelength solution from the measurement of the centroids of thar lines in the two orthogonally circularly polarized comparison spectra .",
    "subsequent steps of the spectral processing and analysis employed the codes written in the eso midas environment @xcite",
    ". further details about spectropolarimetric observations of hd37776  as well as reduction and analysis of these data can be found in @xcite .",
    "hd37776  was observed in three different wavelength regions during the spectropolarimetric campaign at sao . by far the most extensive data set of 30 circular polarization spectra is available for the region containing the  5876    line .",
    "these spectra have a signal - to - noise ratio of 300500 and cover the 58305900    wavelength interval , which includes the sharp interstellar d lines .",
    "these features are not expected to show detectable polarization signal , allowing us to verify and fine - tune the relative wavelength alignment of the left- and right - hand circularly polarized beams in each observation .",
    "the rotation phases of the sao spectra were calculated using the non - linear ephemeris of @xcite , consistently with the longitudinal field data .",
    "these circular polarization observations provide a dense coverage of the rotational cycle of the star .",
    "the average phase sampling is 0.03 and the largest phase gap is 0.14 of the rotation period .",
    "@xcite used a subset of 9 spectrograms from the sao  5876    data in their doppler - zeeman analysis of hd37776 .",
    "this subset provides a poor rotational phase coverage , with several phase gaps as large as 0.20.3 .",
    "in this section we aim to revise the multipolar model of @xcite using the new ephemeris of hd37776  and a more realistic value of the inclination angle of the stellar rotational axis .",
    "@xcite assumed @xmath15 , which together with the rotational period found in previous studies of hd37776  and @xmath16=91  kms@xmath17  determined below ( sect .",
    "[ mdi ] ) implies an implausibly small radius , @xmath18 , for a main sequence b2 star .",
    "other authors reported systematically larger radii : @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this range of radii corresponds to inclination angles between 40  and 50 . giving more weight to the more recent parameter determination by @xcite",
    ", we adopt @xmath22 .",
    "this inclination angle is close to @xmath23 favored by the doppler imaging analysis of @xcite .",
    "keeping the inclination angle fixed , we used a least - squares optimization algorithm to fit the observed @xmath1  curve with a low - order , axisymmetric multipolar magnetic field topology .",
    "the free parameters of this widely used global magnetic field parameterization @xcite include the angles @xmath8 and @xmath24 , giving the obliquity and azimuth of the magnetic field axis .",
    "the field intensity and structure are determined by the polar strengths of the dipolar @xmath25 , quadrupolar @xmath26 , and octupolar @xmath27 magnetic components .    our best - fit multipolar model of the field topology in hd37776",
    "is characterized by the reduce chi - square @xmath28 and has the following parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31  kg , @xmath32  kg , @xmath33  kg .",
    "the upper panel in figure  [ fig : bz ] shows the comparison between the @xmath1  measurements and the model longitudinal field curve .",
    "evidently a very strong axisymmetric octupolar magnetic field structure is capable of providing a reasonably good approximation of the complex longitudinal magnetic field variation of hd37776  ( figure  [ fig : bz ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the inferred multipolar field topology is illustrated in more detail in figure  [ fig : sph_bz ] .",
    "these spherical maps demonstrate that the field strength varies between 35 and 100 kg over the stellar surface .",
    "the mean field modulus changes from 43 to 49  kg with the stellar rotation phase ( figure  [ fig : bz ] , lower panel ) .    taken at face value , the multipolar field modeling results suggest that hd37776  is indeed the most magnetized non - degenerate star .",
    "we reconstructed the magnetic field topology of hd37776  with the help of the doppler imaging ( di ) code invers10 .",
    "this magnetic inversion code was described by @xcite and @xcite , and applied to the analysis of ap - star magnetic field geometries by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "invers10  determines the surface distributions of the magnetic field vector and chemical abundance from the phase - resolved spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "the code models individual line profiles using a realistic numerical treatment of the polarized radiative transfer in a stellar atmosphere .",
    "the surface maps are constrained by the tikhonov regularization @xcite , which ensures the uniqueness of the di reconstruction and provides the smoothest solution justified by the observational data .",
    "the absence of the stokes @xmath34 and @xmath35 data in our study might complicate the magnetic field reconstruction , leading to some cross - talk between the radial and meridional field components at low latitudes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as suggested by the recent comparison of the magnetic inversions for the ap star @xmath36  cvn using four stokes parameter observations and limiting the input data to circular polarization alone @xcite , the linear polarization spectra enable reconstruction of small - scale surface magnetic features that can not be detected with stokes @xmath11 data . we emphasize that these problems arising due to lack of linear polarimetry are not unique to our study but apply to all previous zeeman doppler imaging analyses of cool active stars and hot massive stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for modeling hd37776  we used a version of our magnetic di code that fits simultaneously the spectropolarimetric data and the longitudinal magnetic field curve @xcite .",
    "the surface maps were sampled on a 1176-element surface grid with an optimal distribution of surface zones ( see figure  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "the polarized spectrum synthesis calculations for the  5876    line employed an lte solar metallicity model atmosphere with @xmath37=22000  k and @xmath38=4.0 from the revised atlas9 grid .",
    "the effective temperature and surface gravity adopted for hd37776  are consistent with the stellar parameters determined in previous studies of this star @xcite .    before proceeding to the magnetic inversion , we compared the predictions of the multipolar magnetic field model obtained in the previous section with the observed circular polarization profiles of the  5876    line . in this calculation",
    "the he abundance was adjusted to be @xmath39\\equiv\\log(n_{\\rm he}/n_{\\rm h})-\\log(n_{\\rm he}/n_{\\rm h})_\\sun=-0.2 $ ] to roughly match the average strength of this line in the unpolarized spectrum .",
    "the comparison of observations and multipolar model predictions is illustrated in figure  [ fig : prf ] .",
    "evidently , the magnetic field topology inferred from the longitudinal field curve alone fails to account for the rotational phase dependence of the circular polarization within the line . in particular ,",
    "major disagreement between the predicted and observed stokes @xmath11 profiles is found for the rotation phases 0.070.29 and 0.610.93 .",
    "similar significant discrepancies between the details of observed @xmath11 profiles of magnetic cp stars and those predicted by multipolar models have been previously found for 53  cam and @xmath8  crb @xcite but not for 78  vir @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the unsatisfactory results obtained with the multipolar field model , the di reconstruction of the magnetic field geometry yields an excellent fit of the circular polarization spectra ( figure  [ fig : prf ] ) and an adequate description of the @xmath1  curve ( figure  [ fig : bz ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the resulting magnetic field distribution , constrained by the tikhonov regularization but not limited to a low - order axisymmetric multipolar topology , is shown in figures  [ fig : sph ] and [ fig : rec ] .",
    "the former figure illustrates the spherical surface maps of the field strength and orientation while the latter one presents the rectangular projections for the radial , meridional , and azimuthal components of the magnetic field vector .",
    "the he abundance distribution obtained together with the magnetic maps is shown in figure  [ fig : sph]c .",
    "the he concentration changes from a moderate underabundance with respect to the solar chemical composition to an overabundance by up to a factor of 100 inside he spots .",
    "our magnetic di reveals a strikingly different picture of the magnetic field in hd37776  compared to the suggestions of previous multipolar models .",
    "the field topology is complex and notably non - axisymmetric .",
    "there are six distinct areas of the positive and negative magnetic polarities , reminiscent of a somewhat distorted @xmath40 spherical harmonic . at the same time",
    ", the di model yields a much weaker surface field strength than commonly assumed for hd37776 .",
    "the field intensity changes from @xmath05  kg to @xmath030  kg across the stellar surface , which is still a lot compared to a typical magnetic b - type star but certainly less than the field on several most extreme members of this group of stars .",
    "the mean magnetic field modulus of hd37776  determined from the di maps varies between 13 and 16  kg .",
    "this is substantially lower than the @xmath046  kg field modulus predicted by the multipolar model ( see figure  [ fig : bz ] , lower panel ) .",
    "aiming to characterize more comprehensively the field topology obtained with the magnetic inversion , we applied to the final di maps the spherical harmonic expansion method of @xcite .",
    "both poloidal and toroidal spherical harmonic modes with the angular degree @xmath41=110 and all possible azimuthal numbers @xmath42 were included in the expansion .",
    "the resulting expansion coefficients are presented in figure  [ fig : expansion ] .",
    "we found that non - axisymmetric @xmath41=34 harmonic components give the largest contribution to the magnetic field topology of hd37776 , although a non - negligible power is evident for the lower - order multipoles and for the @xmath41 values up to 56 .",
    "the relative fractions of the poloidal and toroidal field components appear to be similar .",
    "the presence of the significant toroidal field in hd37776  is an interesting and somewhat unexpected result .",
    "although the toroidal component frequently dominates over the poloidal one in cool active stars @xcite , it is seldom diagnosed in hot magnetic stars and is never included in the parameterized low - order multipolar field models of these stars .",
    "results of the present investigation as well as the previous polarization line profile studies by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the toroidal component should not be disregarded in the magnetic field analysis of hot stars .",
    "the strong magnetic fields of the early - type stars have a prominent effect on their radiatively driven winds and circumstellar environment .",
    "it is understood that a strong enough magnetic field confines the mass loss , producing the regions of hot , x - ray emitting shocks and cooler , denser clouds where the plasma is trapped by the magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "the magnetically confined wind and inhomogeneous magnetospheres manifest themselves with the characteristic variability of the wind - sensitive uv lines @xcite , emission in the hydrogen balmer lines @xcite , and photometric indices @xcite .",
    "the rotational spin - down , recently detected in some helium - strong stars including hd37776  @xcite , is also determined by the interaction between the wind and the stellar magnetic field @xcite .    with the exception of the slowly rotating , chemically normal early b - type star @xmath2  sco , which has a weak non - dipolar magnetic field @xcite ,",
    "the previous studies of the hot - star magnetospheres were limited to the objects with dipolar fields .",
    "our analysis of hd37776  probes a previously unexplored parameter range , offering an insight into the magnetospheric structure and the wind - field interaction for a star possessing a strong magnetic field with a very complex geometry .    to investigate the extended magnetic field topology of hd37776  we calculated the three - dimensional structure of the circumstellar magnetic field using the potential field extrapolation technique of @xcite . in this method",
    "the magnetospheric field is determined using the radial field component of the magnetic di map and setting a spherical source function at the alfvn radius , where the field lines are expected to become open under the wind pressure .",
    "this outer boundary surface is located where the wind confinement parameter @xmath43 @xcite , characterizing the ratio between the magnetic field energy and the kinetic energy of the wind , is on the order of unity .    adopting the typical magnetic field strength at the stellar surface @xmath44@xmath014.5  kg , the stellar radius @xmath45@xmath04@xmath46 @xcite , the average mass - loss rate @xmath47@xmath48@xmath49year@xmath17 , and the terminal wind speed @xmath50@xmath48@xmath51  kms@xmath17  @xcite , we find the wind confinement parameter @xmath43@xmath48@xmath52 for hd37776 .",
    "this yields the alfvn radius @xmath53 for a dipole - dominated surface field and @xmath54 for a quadrupolar magnetic topology .    despite several uncertainties in our estimate of @xmath43 and @xmath55 , the results of the potential field extrapolation in the immediate vicinity of the star are weakly dependent on the assumed location of the source surface as long as @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , we limit the following discussion to the inner @xmath57 of the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "the circumstellar magnetic field topology established in this region with the potential field extrapolation procedure is illustrated in figure  [ fig:3d ] . in this plot",
    "the closed magnetic field lines are rendered for four rotation phases .",
    "the color variation along each field line corresponds to the radial field component .",
    "not unexpectedly , we find that the magnetospheric field structure of hd37776  is far more complex than a dipolar or an axisymmetric low - order multipolar field .",
    "the extended field topology is dominated by a network of the closed magnetic field lines , concentrated along the six ridges stretched mostly in the meridional direction .",
    "the location of the closed field line loops is determined by the six distinct areas of the positive and negative field polarity on the stellar surface ( see figure  [ fig : rec ] ) .",
    "this non - trivial inner magnetospheric field structure should give rise to an equally complex rotational phase dependence of the parameters tracing the wind inhomogeneities and circumstellar matter .",
    "in this paper we presented a new analysis of the magnetic field observations of the unique he - strong star hd37776 .",
    "the unusually complex magnetic field of this object distinguishes it from other early - type stars , which have mostly dipolar field topologies .",
    "we reanalyzed the longitudinal magnetic field measurements of hd37776 , finding that a very strong , @xmath58  kg , octupolar field is required to reproduce the rotational modulation of @xmath1  under the assumption of an axisymmetric multipolar topology .",
    "however , we found that this multipolar model is incompatible with the circular polarization time - series observations of the  5876    line . using both the longitudinal magnetic field measurements and the stokes @xmath11 spectra , we derived a new model of the surface magnetic field topology of hd37776  with the help of magnetic doppler imaging .",
    "this magnetic field structure for the first time explained all the different types of magnetic observations available for hd37776 .",
    "the field turns out to be highly complex , bearing no resemblance to a low - order , axisymmetric multipolar geometry commonly assumed for early - type stars .",
    "thus , together with @xmath2  sco , which has a much weaker field @xcite , hd37776  belongs to an unusual group of the early - type stars with conspicuously non - dipolar fields .",
    "our investigation of the longitudinal magnetic field variations of hd37776  clearly demonstrated the fundamental limitation of the multipolar field models based on fitting the @xmath1  curve alone . while the multipolar model requires a record - strong field to reproduce the @xmath1  measurements , magnetic di yields an order of magnitude weaker magnetic field intensity , with the average field strength @xmath59  kg .",
    "this is below the field modulus directly measured with the zeeman splitting in several ap / bp stars @xcite .",
    "the he abundance distribution in hd37776  was previously studied by @xcite using a subset of data analyzed here and a somewhat less sophisticated line profile modeling technique @xcite .",
    "their he abundance map is compared with ours in figure  [ fig : he ] .",
    "the he spot distribution derived by khokhlova et al . has a significantly higher contrast and abundance range , but the location of the two main overabundance features agree reasonably well with our results . on the other hand , the fine structure of the he variation across the surface of hd37776  inferred by khokhlova et al .",
    "is likely to be spurious .    using the magnetic field topology inferred with doppler imaging as a starting point , we applied the potential field extrapolation method to calculate the extended magnetospheric field geometry of hd37776 .",
    "the field structure above the stellar surface was found to be complex and non - axisymmetric , with most of the field lines closed within a sphere of @xmath57 .",
    "this magnetic geometry must correspond to an unusually complicated configuration of the magnetospheric plasma , which is broadly consistent with @xcite observations of the complex variation of the and uv wind diagnostic lines .",
    "the existence and stability ( at least on the time - scale of a few decades covered by the longitudinal field measurements ) of the very complex magnetic field in hd37776  poses an interesting challenge to the fossil field theory , which is usually applied to explain the magnetism of massive stars .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite demonstrated that both toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields of comparable strength must be present in the stellar interior to maintain the global stability of the fossil field structure . on the surface",
    ", the field appears to be purely poloidal , axisymmetric and dipolar - like . in the context of these results , it is difficult to explain complex non - dipolar magnetic fields with a substantial toroidal contribution at the stellar surface .",
    "subsequent mhd calculations by @xcite revealed a different class of the stable magnetic equilibrium solutions , consisting of one or several large - scale twisted flux tubes lying under the surface of the star .",
    "each tube is formed by the toroidal field , with the poloidal field lines wrapped around it .",
    "the multiple flux tube scenario , realized in braithwaite s simulations if the initial unstructured magnetic flux is sufficiently spread out inside the star , seems to be applicable to the cases of @xmath2  sco and hd37776 .",
    "however , the theory still has difficulties explaining the observed presence of significant surface toroidal field in both stars .",
    "in particular , it is challenging to understand the origin and nature of the current system in the stellar atmosphere required to support these toroidal fields .",
    "the complex equilibrium fields studied by @xcite evolve on diffusive time - scales , comparable to the stellar life - time on the main sequence .",
    "the flux tubes gradually rise towards the surface and undergo lengthening and narrowing due to the loss of toroidal magnetic flux .",
    "it is generally expected that the diffusive field decay proceeds faster for higher - order magnetic components . in this case",
    ", the magnetic topology of the old stars should be closer to dipolar , while the field structure of young stars , such as hd37776  ( @xmath60 yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , could be more complex . however , @xcite presented examples of simpler axisymmetric fields evolving into more complex , non - axisymmetric ones . a calculation tuned for the specific parameters of hd37776",
    "is required to ascertain whether these changes can be observable and to what extent the unusually high degree of complexity of the field in this star can be related to its youth .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that the presence of a very complex strong magnetic field in a young , early b - type star is not inconsistent with the current qualitative predictions of the fossil field theory .",
