    "actinide based materials possess interesting physical behaviors due to the existence of strongly - correlated 5@xmath2 electrons and have attracted extensive attentions @xcite . different from actinide oxides which have been widely studied to reveal the detailed configurations and correlation effects of the 5@xmath2 electrons @xcite , none of the actinide chalcogenides has ever received comparable concerns . here",
    "we take us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 as two representatives to study the electron correlation and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effects of 5@xmath2 electrons in actinide chalcogenides .",
    "the other reason for us to investigate their electronic structures is that they employ the layered mx@xmath1 structure ( with m to be a metal element , and x to be s , se , or te ) , which can be used as models for studying electronic behaviors in 1-dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "the mx@xmath1 structure belongs to the space group of p2@xmath3/@xmath4 , with its atomic organizations depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) . in the monoclinic lattice , the top two chalcogen ( s , se or te ) atoms form a tightly bound pair suggesting that the mx@xmath1 compounds may be regarded as mx(x@xmath5 ) @xcite . the top x - x pair together with an underneath m and a more underneath x atom form a triangular unit , which repeats along the @xmath6 lattice direction forming a 1d chain , and two such triangle units form a unit cell of the mx@xmath1 compounds in the ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) plane . in this way",
    ", the mx@xmath1 compounds are always considered as 1d materials . for example , the metallic zrte@xmath1 and nbse@xmath1 exhibiting charge - density - wave transitions have been thoroughly investigated in angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) and optical experiments @xcite . in the present paper , by contrast , we address the electronic structures of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , two semiconducting members of the mx@xmath1 family .    in studies of actinide based materials , one has to be careful for the electron correlation and soc effects of the actinide 5@xmath2 electrons .",
    "as an example , for actinide dioxides conventional density functional theory ( dft ) schemes that apply the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) underestimate the strong on - site coulomb repulsion of the 5@xmath2 electrons and consequently fail to capture the insulating properties @xcite . several approaches , the lda / gga+@xmath0 , the hybrid density functional of ( heyd , scuseria , and enzerhof ) hse ,",
    "the self - interaction corrected local spin - density ( sic - lsd ) , and the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , have been developed to correct the pure lda / gga failures in calculations of actinide materials . among them",
    "the effective modification of pure dft by lda / gga+@xmath0 formalisms has been widely used in theoretical studies of uo@xmath5 @xcite and puo@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the obtained structural parameters as well as the electronic structure and phonon dispersion curves @xcite accord well with experiments . in our present work , the gga+@xmath0 schemes due to dudarev _",
    "_ @xcite are employed to study the electron correlation and spin - orbit coupling effects in us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , as well as the two materials electronic , mechanical , and raman properties .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the computational method is briefly described . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of the physical properties of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , and discuss the electron correlation and soc effects of the uranium 5@xmath2 electrons .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "iv , we close our paper with a summary of our main results .",
    "our total - energy calculations are carried out by employing the plane - wave basis pseudopotential method as implemented in vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the exchange and correlation effects are described with the gga approximation in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) form @xcite .",
    "the projected augmented wave ( paw ) method of blchl @xcite is employed with the frozen - core approximation .",
    "electron wave function is expanded in plane waves up to a cutoff energy of 400 ev and all atoms are fully relaxed until the hellmann - feynman forces on them are less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "a 7@xmath99@xmath91 monkhorst - pack @xcite k - point mesh is employed for integration over the brillouin zone of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 .",
    "the uranium 6@xmath106@xmath115@xmath126@xmath137@xmath10 , sulphur 3@xmath103@xmath11 , and selenium 4@xmath104@xmath11 electrons are treated as valence electrons .",
    "noncollinear calculations are used when considering the spin - orbital coupling effects . the strong on - site coulomb repulsions among the localized uranium",
    "5@xmath2 electrons are described by using the formalism formulated by dudarev et al .",
    "@xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the total gga energy functional is of the form @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the density matrix of @xmath2 states with spin @xmath16 , while @xmath0 and @xmath17 are the spherically averaged screened coulomb energy and the exchange energy , respectively .    in this paper , the coulomb @xmath0 is treated as a variable , while the exchange energy is set to be a constant @xmath17=0.51 ev .",
    "this value of @xmath17 is in the ball park of the commonly accepted one for uranium compounds @xcite and close to the theoretically predicted value of 0.54 ev in uo@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "since only the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath17 is significant , we will henceforth label them as one single parameter @xmath18=@xmath0-@xmath17 , while keeping in mind that the nonzero @xmath17 has been used during calculations .",
    "the phonon frequencies at the gamma point for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are calculated by using the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) . and",
    "their raman - active frequencies are obtained through symmetry analysis on the corresponding vibration modes . before dfpt calculations",
    ", the lattice constants and atomic positions of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are further optimized using a denser @xmath19-point mesh of 9@xmath913@xmath93 , and a finer force convergence criteria of 0.001 ev /  .",
    "a 2@xmath92@xmath91 supercell is subsequently used for dfpt calculations . since both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1",
    "are stacked along the @xmath8 direction through van der waals interactions , and with relatively large lattice constants , we do not extend the supercell along the @xmath8 direction . during dfpt calculations on the 2@xmath92@xmath91 supercell ,",
    "the @xmath19-point mesh is set to be 5@xmath97@xmath95 , and the energy convergence criteria is set to be 1e-6 ev .",
    "experimentally , the magnetic orderings of uranium trichalcogenides were studied ever since 1961 @xcite .",
    "the relatively large atomic distances between neighboring u atoms in us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 suggest that magnetic orderings may occur in these compounds through super - exchange interactions of uranium 5@xmath2 electrons via the s or se ions @xcite . and",
    "different measurements indicate that both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 crystals undergo afm transitions at very low temperatures , with the magnetic moments of the two uranium atoms within each unit cell opposite to each other @xcite . in the present gga+@xmath0 study , we consider the nonmagnetic ( nm ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phases for each choice of the @xmath18 value and then determine the lowest - energy state by a subsequent total - energy comparison of these three phases .",
    "our calculated electronic energies for different magnetic phases of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are all listed in table i. one can see that within gga formalism or the gga+@xmath0 formalism with a too small @xmath18 value , the fm state is more stable for both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , in contradiction with experimental results . therefore , the electron correlation effect has to be accounted for to correctly describe ground - state us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 . in the discussions that follow ,",
    "we will confine our reports to the afm solutions for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 .",
    "the experimentally determined lattice parameters of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are ( @xmath20=5.37  , @xmath21=3.96  , @xmath22=9.94  ) and ( @xmath20=5.65  , @xmath21=4.06  , @xmath22=10.47  ) respectively @xcite .",
    "our calculated lattice constants with different @xmath18 values are summarized in table ii , together with the experimental results .",
    "we can see that different from what we found for actinide dioxides @xcite , the lattice constants of actinide trichalcogenides do not change monotonically with the value of the @xmath18 parameter .",
    "besides , the lattice constants obtained in gga calculations are obviously too small in comparison with corresponding experimental results , for both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 . for us@xmath1 ,",
    "the value of @xmath18 has to be as large as 6 ev to get reasonable lattice constants compared with experimental results .",
    "differently , a @xmath23 value of 4 ev is enough to get reasonable lattice constants for use@xmath1 , and changing @xmath18 from 4 to 6 ev has negligible effects on the obtained lattice constants .    besides of the prominent changes in the atomic structure parameters , the most dramatic improvement brought by the gga+@xmath0 formalism when compared to the gga results is in the description of electronic structure properties . for this , we have investigated the band structures in afm phases for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 aiming at revealing the fundamental influences of considering the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show the obtained local density of states ( ldos ) for the s1 , s3 , and u atoms in us@xmath1 , and se1 , se3 , and u atoms in use@xmath1 respectively . without accounting for the on - site coulomb repulsion",
    ", one can see that the gga calculations predict an incorrect metallic ground state by nonzero occupation of uranium electrons at the fermi energy ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "when switching on the @xmath18 parameter , as shown both in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , the uranium electronic states in us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 begin to split at @xmath24 and tend to form two peaks with the gap of @xmath25 .",
    "the amplitude of this gap increases with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "previous electric resistivity measurements pointed out that use@xmath1 did not conduct at room temperatures @xcite , thus a band gap at @xmath24 should be contained in its electronic structure .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "2(b ) that an energy band gap appears only when @xmath18 is larger than or equal to 4 ev for use@xmath1 . for us@xmath1 ,",
    "the value of @xmath18 has to be enlarged to 6 ev to open the band gap at the fermi energy .",
    "these results also imply that the electron correlation strength might be different in us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 . from the last figure in figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , we can see that the sulphur ( selenium ) and uranium electronic states overlap with each other and contribute equally to the valence band maximum ( vbm ) of us@xmath1 ( use@xmath1 ) , while the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) is composed of uranium electronic states .",
    "the orbital mixing between sulphur ( selenium ) and uranium electronic states below the fermi energy indicates that there are covalent interactions between the sulphur ( selenium ) and uranium atoms in us@xmath1 ( use@xmath1 ) .    to further analyze the orbital - resolved electronic structures , we calculate the projected density of states ( pdos ) for the x-@xmath26 ( @xmath27=3 ( x = s ) or 4 ( x = se ) ) , u-5@xmath2 and u-6@xmath28 electronic states in ux@xmath1 . figures 3(a)-3(d ) show the obtained pdos for us@xmath1 in different calculations , while the corresponding pdos results for use@xmath1 are shown in figs .",
    "3(e)-3(h ) .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is chosen to be 6 ev in all gga+@xmath0 and gga+@xmath0+soc calculations .",
    "one can see that without considering the electron correlation effect , us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are both wrongly predicted as metallic materials , which contradicts with experimental results . after adding the @xmath0 parameter to describe the strong on - site energy of u-5@xmath2 electrons ,",
    "the energy gaps are opened for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 .",
    "we can see from figs .",
    "3(d ) and 3(h ) that further considering soc has little influences on the electronic states around the fermi energy . for both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 ,",
    "the soc effect lies in the deep energy level , causing an energy splitting of the u-6@xmath28 states . from the pdos results",
    ", we can also see clear difference between the x1- and x3-@xmath26 ( n=3 ( x = s ) or 4(x = se ) ) electronic states . the pdos for the electronic states of the x2 atom is very similar to that of the x1 atom and thus is not shown here .",
    "the different electronic state distribution of the x1(x2 ) and x3 atoms proves the theory of considering ux@xmath1 as ux(x@xmath5 ) , and indicates the strong covalent bondings between the x1 and x2 atoms .    to analyze more carefully the soc effects in us@xmath1 and use@xmath1",
    ", we recalculate the electronic structures of them with higher resolutions , with the reduced gaussian smearing width of only 0.02 ev and a pdos resolution of 0.01 ev .",
    "figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) show the obtained pdos results for uranium 5@xmath2 electrons of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , by using the gga method , while figs . 5(a ) and 5(b ) show the obtained energy band structures of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 by using the gga+@xmath0 method , respectively .",
    "all the gga+soc and gga+@xmath0+soc calculations are noncollinear , with both soc and orbital polarizations considered . and",
    "the results before and after considering the soc effects are shown in solid and dotted lines respectively . from the pdos results obtained by using the gga method",
    ", we can see that pure inclusion of soc to the gga method does not lead to energy band gaps for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 .",
    "this discovery is different from the situation of coo , where soc can solely open a band gap @xcite .    from the band structures of us@xmath1 shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) , we can see that both the lowest unoccupied conduction and highest occupied valence bands distribute along the @xmath29-z direction . for the lowest conduction band",
    ", the soc effect causes an energy downshift of 0.05 ev along the @xmath29-z direction .",
    "contrarily for its highest valence band , the soc effect causes an energy upshift of 0.03 ev at the @xmath29 point and an upshift of 0.07 ev at the z point . as a result , the energy band gap of us@xmath1 changes from indirect ( @xmath30z ) into direct type ( z@xmath31z ) after considering the soc effect , and the gap value reduces from 1.59 to be 1.48 ev . different from us@xmath1 , the lowest conduction and highest valence bands of use@xmath1 distributes along the k@xmath3-b and b-@xmath29-y directions respectively . for the lowest conduction band along the k@xmath3-b direction",
    ", the soc effect causes an energy downshift of 0.04 ev at the k@xmath3 point and a downshift of 0.02 ev at the b point .",
    "correspondingly the cbm of use@xmath1 moves from b to the k@xmath3 point .",
    "however , since the vbm of use@xmath1 is at some point along the b-@xmath29-y direction instead of at any high - symmetry @xmath19 points , the soc effect does not change the indirect band gap type .",
    "overall the band gap of use@xmath1 changes from 1.30 to be 1.23 ev after considering the soc effect .",
    "our studies reveal that the energy band gap of use@xmath1 is smaller than that of us@xmath1 .",
    "after systematically presenting the electronic structure results for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , we now turn to their mechanical properties .",
    "the elastic constants are obtained by solving the eigenvalues of their hessian matrix , which is calculated based on the hooke s law and small position changes on independent s , se and u atoms .",
    "the obtained elastic constants of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 in different calculations by using the gga and gga+@xmath0 methods are both listed in table iii .",
    "we can see that the elastic constants calculated by using the gga formalism for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 do not satisfy the stability criteria @xcite for monoclinic structures that the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 should be all positive .",
    "this result further proves that conventional gga formalism fails for describing the uranium trichalcogenides .",
    "contrarily , the calculated elastic constants by using the gga+@xmath0 method for both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 satisfy the above stability criteria , as well as the other six criteria for monoclinic structures @xcite , proving the stable existence of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , and their strong electron correlation effects .",
    "based on the elastic constants of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , we further calculate the voigt and reuss bounds on their bulk ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) and shear moduli ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) @xcite . and the bulk and shear moduli of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 can be estimated by @xmath42=(@xmath38+@xmath39)/2 , and @xmath43=(@xmath40+@xmath41)/2 . and the poisson s ratios can be calculated by @xmath44=(3@xmath42 - 2@xmath43)/(6@xmath42 + 2@xmath43 ) . the obtained mechanical properties for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are all listed in table iv .",
    "we can see that the voigt and beuss bounds obviously differ from each other for bulk and shear moduli .",
    "this result reflects the structural anisotropy of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 . besides",
    ", the bulk and shear moduli are both found to be larger for us@xmath1 than for use@xmath1 .",
    "the poisson s ratio is calculated to be 0.19 and 0.22 for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 respectively .",
    "until now , there are no experimental reports on the mechanical properties of us@xmath1 or use@xmath1 . hence our theoretical values can be used as references for further investigations or industrial applications of them . at another side , the raman properties of the mx@xmath1 group materials have been systematically studied for a long time , and some of the characteristic peaks of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 were successfully observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we further calculate the raman properties of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 . according to group theory and the symmetry of them , both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1",
    "are predicted to have 12 raman - active vibrational modes @xcite : 8 a@xmath45 and 4 b@xmath45 modes respectively .",
    "the symbols a@xmath45 and b@xmath45 represent for two different vibration symmetries respectively : vibrations inside and out of the mirror plane .",
    "specifically , a@xmath45 corresponds to the vibrations where @xmath46 is always 0 while b@xmath45 corresponds to the vibrations where @xmath46 is not 0 .",
    "our raman results of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are obtained by symmetry analysis based on the vibrational modes calculated within the gga+@xmath0 method , where soc effects are considered .",
    "figures 6(a ) and 6(b ) show our determined raman frequencies for us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 respectively , together with the experimental results by g. nouvel _ et al .",
    "one can see that by using the gga formalism for both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , the raman frequencies are totally confused compared with the experimental results . at another side , the gga+@xmath0 results on the raman frequencies are clearly reasonable in two obvious aspects : i ) there exist a highest single raman frequency for both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , corresponding to the molecular - like x@xmath5 mode vibrations ; ii ) the highest raman frequency of us@xmath1 is much larger than that of use@xmath1 , indicating that the s - s interaction is stronger than se - se .",
    "when comparing all the raman frequencies , there seems to be a frequency shift of about 25@xmath4735 @xmath48 between our gga+@xmath0 and the experimental results .",
    "by using the gga and gga+@xmath0 methods , we have systematically studied the electronic , mechanical , and raman properties of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , aiming to reveal the underlying electron correlation and soc effects . by comparing the calculated lattice constants of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 with corresponding experimental results , and monitoring their electronic structures with different @xmath18 parameters ,",
    "we conclude that a @xmath18 value of 6 ev is needed to get reasonable lattice constants , and the right insulating properties for both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 . after considering soc effects ,",
    "the deep u-6@xmath28 band will be split into two separate energy bands in both us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 .",
    "the soc effects also changes the energy band shapes around the fermi energies and lead to the fact that us@xmath1 is a direct band gap while use@xmath1 is an indirect band gap insulator . because of the soc effects",
    ", the energy band gaps of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 reduce by 0.11 and 0.07 ev respectively .",
    "based on the obtained antiferromagnetic ground states of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , we then systematically give out their electrical , mechanical , and raman properties .",
    "the vbm and cbm of us@xmath1 ( use@xmath1 ) are found to be contributed by 3@xmath28 - 5@xmath2 ( 4@xmath28 - 5@xmath2 ) hybrid and 5@xmath2 ( 5@xmath2 ) electronic states respectively .",
    "the elastic constants of us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 are found to satisfy the stability criteria , and their poisson s ratios are calculated to be 0.19 and 0.22 respectively . for the raman properties , we theoretically repeat the two important experimental observations that the s - s or se - se dimer vibrations have the largest frequencies in us@xmath1 and use@xmath1 , and the frequency of the s - s dimer vibration is larger than that of the se - se dimer vibration .",
