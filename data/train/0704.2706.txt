    "in this paper , we present a number of results concerning a dynamical version of coalescing random walks , which was recently introduced in  @xcite .",
    "our results concern times of hausdorff dimension less than one where the system of coalescing walks behaves exceptionally .",
    "the results are analogous to and were motivated by the model of dynamical percolation and its exceptional times  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we define the basic model treated in this paper , which we call the dynamical discrete web ( ddw ) , recall some facts about dynamical percolation , and then briefly describe our main results .",
    "the justification for calling this model a discrete web is that there is a natural scaling limit , which is one of our main motivations for analyzing the discrete web ( as it is in  @xcite ) ; we also discuss in this section that scaling limit , which is a dynamical version of the brownian web ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a paper is in preparation  @xcite on the construction of that model , which is closely related to the brownian net of sun and swart  @xcite .",
    "we note that conjectures conerning ways to construct scaling limits of dynamical percolation ( in two - dimensional space ) appear in  @xcite .",
    "we further note that exceptional times for dynamical versions of random walks in various spatial dimensions have been studied in @xcite and elsewhere , but these are quite different from the random walks of the ddw , as we note in subsection  [ mainresults ] below .",
    "let @xmath4 for @xmath5 denote a simple symmetric random walk on @xmath6 starting at @xmath7 , i.e. at @xmath8 at @xmath9 .",
    "( for real @xmath10 , we set @xmath11)$ ] , where @xmath12 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath13 . ) if we also consider other simple symmetric random walks starting from arbitrary points on the even space - time sublattice @xmath14 , which are independent of each other except that they coalesce when they meet , that is the system of ( one - dimensional ) coalescing random walks that is closely related to the one - dimensional ( discrete time ) voter model ( see  @xcite ) and may be thought of as a one plus one dimensional directed percolation model .",
    "the percolation structure is highlighted by defining @xmath15 for @xmath16 to be the increment between times @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the random walker at location @xmath19 at time @xmath17 .",
    "these bernoulli variables are symmetric and independent and the paths of all the coalescing random walks can be reconstructed by assigning to any point @xmath20 an arrow pointing from @xmath20 to @xmath21 and considering all the paths starting from arbitrary points in @xmath22 and following the arrows .",
    "we note that there is also a set of dual ( or backward ) paths defined by the same @xmath15 s with arrows from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the collection of all dual paths is a system of backward ( in time ) coalescing random walks that do not cross any of the forward paths .    the ddw is a very simple stochastic process @xmath25 in a new dynamical time parameter @xmath0 whose distribution at any deterministic @xmath0 is exactly that of the static coalescing random walk model just described .",
    "specifically , let @xmath26 be a family of independent continuous time cadlag markov processes with state space @xmath27 and rate @xmath28 for changing state in either direction , with the initial condition that @xmath29 is a family of independent bernoulli random variables with @xmath30 .",
    "although this dynamical version of coalescing random walks sounds quite trivial at first hearing , it turns out that it can have interesting behavior at exceptional values of the dynamical time parameter s. this is a feature that it shares in common with dynamical percolation .",
    "static percolation models are defined also in terms of independent bernoulli variables @xmath31 , indexed by points @xmath32 in some @xmath33-dimensional lattice , which in general are asymmetric with parameter @xmath34 .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath35 when the system has a transition from having infinite clusters ( connected components ) with probability zero to having them with probability one .",
    "it is expected that at @xmath36 there are no infinite clusters and this is proved for @xmath37 and for high @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in dynamical percolation one extends @xmath31 to time varying functions @xmath38 , as in the case of coalescing walks , except that the transition rates for the jump processes @xmath38 are chosen to have the critical asymmetric @xmath39 distribution to be invariant .",
    "the question raised in  @xcite was whether there were exceptional times when an infinite cluster ( say , one containing the origin ) occurs , even though this does not occur at deterministic times .",
    "this was answered negatively in  @xcite for large @xmath33 and , more remarkably , was answered positively by schramm and steiff for @xmath37 in  @xcite , where they further obtained upper and lower bounds on the hausdorff dimension ( as a subset of the dynamical time axis ) of these exceptional times .",
    "we apply in this paper the approaches used for dynamical percolation to the dynamical discrete web .",
    "although we restrict attention to one - dimensional random walks whose paths are in two - dimensional space - time and hence analogous to @xmath37 dynamical percolation , by considering different possible exceptional phenomena , we use both the high @xmath33 and @xmath37 approaches of  @xcite .",
    "a natural initial question was whether there might be exceptional dynamical times @xmath0 for which the walk from the origin @xmath40 is transient ( say to @xmath41 ) .",
    "our first main result ( see theorem  [ th1 ] in section  [ tameness ] below ) , modeled after the high-@xmath33 dynamical percolation results , is that there are no such exceptional times .",
    "as we explain in remark  [ remtame ] in section  [ tameness ] , a small modification of the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] shows that there are also no exceptional times where some pair of walks avoids eventually coalescing .",
    "our other two main results are modelled after the @xmath37 dynamical percolation results .",
    "one of them ( see theorem  [ violation ] below ) concerns a kind of violation of the central limit theorem , or more accurately a kind of weak subdiffusivity , by the random walk @xmath40 for exceptional dynamical times @xmath0 ; namely , that @xmath42 for all @xmath43 .",
    "the other ( see theorem  [ dimension ] ) gives upper and lower bounds on the hausdorff dimension of these exceptional times , that depend nontrivially on the constant @xmath3 so that the dimension tends to zero ( respectively , one ) as @xmath44 ( respectively , @xmath45 ) .",
    "this is strikingly in contrast with the dynamical random walks of @xcite where there are no exceptional times for which the law of the iterated logarithm fails . to explain why the walks of @xcite can behave so differently from those of the discrete web , we note that a single switch in the former case affects only a single increment of the walk while some switches in the discrete web change the path of the walker by a `` macroscopic '' amount , as discussed in the next subsection on scaling limits    see also figure  1 where switching has changed one of the paths macroscopically .    by an obvious symmetry argument",
    ", there are also exceptional dynamical times @xmath0 for which @xmath46 .",
    "one may ask whether there are exceptional @xmath0 for which @xmath47 .",
    "as discussed in remark  [ twosided ] below , it can be shown , at least for small @xmath3 , that there are no such exceptional times .",
    "the case of large @xmath3 is unresolved .",
    "[ fixeds ]   be the random walk at dynamical time @xmath0 starting from @xmath48 .",
    "this graph , with @xmath13 the horizontal and @xmath49 the vertical coordinate , represents simultaneously the family of functions @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the lowest path , say for @xmath13 greater than about @xmath52 , differs `` macroscopically '' from the others.,title=\"fig : \" ]      there is a natural scaling limit of the ( static ) coalescing random walks model , the brownian web ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "here one does a usual diffusive scaling in which the random walk time @xmath13 is scaled by @xmath53 , and space by @xmath54 so that the random walk path starting from @xmath55 $ ] at time @xmath56 $ ] scales to a brownian motion starting from @xmath57 at time @xmath58 .",
    "the collection of all random walk paths from all space - time starting points scales to a collection of coalescing brownian motion paths starting from all points of continuum space - time . now taking the rate of switching to be of order @xmath59 , rescaling time and space respectively by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and then letting @xmath60 go to @xmath8 leads to a nontrivial limit @xmath61 , the dynamical brownian web .",
    "the idea of taking a scaling limit of the dynamical discrete web to obtain a dynamical continuum model is a natural one , which is at the heart of  @xcite , although their approach appears to be somewhat different than the one we had already been taking .",
    "both approaches are closely related to the brownian net construction of sun and swart  @xcite as will be extensively explored in  @xcite .",
    "as we shall discuss in the next subsection , our approach is based on the construction of a certain poissonian marking of special space - time points of the ( static ) brownian web .",
    "these are the so - called @xmath62 points where a single brownian web path enters the point from earlier times and then two paths leave to later times , one to the left and one to the right with exactly one of the those two paths the continuation of the path from earlier time and the other one `` newly - born '' ; see figure  2 .",
    "neither the idea of doing a poissonian marking of special points for the brownian web nor the idea of using those marked points to construct a scaling limit of a dynamical discrete model is completely new .",
    "in particular , we note that a different type of marking ( of @xmath63 points ) was used in  @xcite to study the scaling limits of noisy voter models . also the idea of using",
    "marked double points of @xmath64 to construct the scaling limit of two - dimensional dynamical percolation is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "one motivation for the proposed marking in the @xmath64 context was the analogy with markings of @xmath62 as well as of @xmath63 points of the brownian web .    in the dynamical brownian web @xmath65 , one can also consider exceptional dynamical times @xmath0 where the path @xmath66 starting from the origin at continuous time @xmath9 behaves differently than an ordinary brownian motion path .",
    "the results of  @xcite are very similar to those of this paper for the discrete web .",
    "indeed , in some respects , the proofs are simpler since calculations with brownian motions are often easier than those with random walks .",
    "there is however one substantial complication , which is the main focus of  @xcite and the reason we do not present the dynamical brownian web exceptional time results already in this paper .",
    "that complication is the actual construction of the dynamical brownian web  a construction that is considerably less trivial than that of the dynamical discrete web , as we explain in the next subsection .",
    "[ changedirections ]   is the vertical and @xmath49 the horizontal coordinate .",
    "if a @xmath67 ( left ) point of the original web ( left side of the figure ) is marked to switch at some @xmath68 $ ] , then the direction of that @xmath62 point in the web @xmath69 is changed at @xmath70 so that it becomes a @xmath71 ( right ) point as on the right side of the figure with the incoming path joined to the rightmost of the two paths starting from that point.,title=\"fig : \" ]    at the discrete level the scaling is chosen in such a way that between the dynamical times @xmath8 and @xmath0 , in a macroscopic box ( i.e. , one with size of order @xmath72 in the original lattice ) , the number of arrows that change direction will be of order @xmath53 .",
    "the situation can be simplified by focusing on switchings with `` macroscopic '' effects ( i.e. , switchings that will lead to a macroscopic alteration of a walker s trajectory in the initial web @xmath73 ) .",
    "a priori , one should also consider combinations of switchings that have macroscopic effects , but it turns out ( this will be proved rigorously in  @xcite ) that the probability of macroscopic effects from switching two or more arrows is negligible compared to switching single arrows , and can be neglected .",
    "there is a natural way of characterizing those critical switchings .",
    "for example , let us consider the forward ( rescaled ) path @xmath74 starting from the origin in @xmath73 and assume that the arrow located at some @xmath75 is orginally oriented to the left .",
    "now we ask whether a switching of this single arrow will alter the path in such a way that the altered path will be to the right of @xmath76 , where @xmath77 are both positive macroscopic quantities .",
    "this will happen if and only if the backward path @xmath78 starting from @xmath79 hits @xmath74 at time @xmath13 ( more precisely , hits @xmath80 at time @xmath81 ) .",
    "more generally , the critical arrows leading to similar alterations are the `` contact '' points between @xmath74 and the backward path @xmath78 at which a switching occurs on @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "but it is now fairly easy to see what the statistics of such a set of points are .",
    "in fact , let @xmath83 be the random variable counting the number of such switchings up to the macroscopic time @xmath13 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath83 is simply given by : @xmath84 where @xmath85 are i.i.d .",
    "bernoulli random variables with @xmath86 , which is @xmath87 as @xmath88 .    as @xmath88",
    ", @xmath89 converges to the `` local time '' @xmath90 of the forward brownian path @xmath91 starting from the origin along a backward brownian path @xmath92 starting on the right of the path @xmath93 ( the joint distribution of @xmath93 and @xmath92 is analysed in  @xcite and this `` local time '' will be defined precisely in  @xcite ) .",
    "further , it is a standard fact that @xmath94 converges to a poisson process .",
    "hence , @xmath83 will converge to a poisson process run by the random clock @xmath95 .",
    "in other words , this set of points will consist of a two - dimensional ( @xmath13 and @xmath0 ) poisson point process with intensity measure @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is lebesgue measure and @xmath98 is the local time measure ( note that @xmath99 will be a locally finite measure so that the poisson process is well defined ) .    so far , we have only selected the critical switchings inducing a specific type of macroscopic effect .",
    "namely , the ones altering the path @xmath93 in such a way that a point originally on one side of @xmath93 will be on the opposite side after switching occurs . but in order to select all the critical arrows leading to any kind of macroscopic changes , we should not only consider a poisson process run by the local time of a single forward path @xmath93 against a single backward path @xmath92 , but rather a poisson process run by the `` local time of the entire forward web along the entire backward web '' multiplied by the intensity @xmath100 .",
    "in other words , the set of marked points will be a three - dimensional poisson point process with intensity measure @xmath101 , where @xmath97 is lebesgue measure ( in the variable @xmath0 ) and @xmath102 is the local time measure of the forward web along the backward web . would not be a locally finite measure  i.e. , the set of marked points in space - time is actually dense in @xmath103 .",
    "however , like what is presented in  @xcite ( see p.  11",
    "there ) , one can add an extra coordinate and lift @xmath102 to be a @xmath104-finite measure , or equivalently approximate @xmath102 by a sequence of locally finite measures @xmath105 , do the markings using @xmath105 , and then let @xmath106 . ]",
    "since the @xmath62 points of the continuum web are precisely those at which a forward and a backward path meet ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the measure @xmath107 will be supported by this set of points . from our previous description of them , it should be clear that each @xmath62 point has a preferred left or right `` direction '' .",
    "for example , a @xmath71 ( right ) point is one for which the continuing path ( coming in from earlier time ) is to the right of the `` newly - born '' path .",
    "hence , at the continuum level , the analog of an arrow switching will simply be a change of direction of all marked @xmath62 points ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "the web @xmath69 at time @xmath108 will be `` simply '' deduced from @xmath109 by switching the direction of all marked @xmath62 points whose @xmath0-coordinate is in @xmath110 $ ] .",
    "a last comment concerns the nature of the dependence of the two continuum paths @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "these turn out to be a pair of `` sticky '' brownian motions , which are independent except when they touch each other .",
    "this is one of the major observations in  @xcite ; we give a brief derivation of this fact in section  [ pairsofpaths ] by analyzing pairs of paths in the discrete setting to see what must occur in the continuum scaling limit . in section  [ tameness ] , we state our main theorem about tameness ; i.e. , that there are no exceptional dynamical times when the random walkers are transient .",
    "we also give there some other results about tameness in two extended remarks  one about non - coalescence and the other about two - sided bounds of order @xmath113 . then in section  [ existence ] , we show that there are exceptional dynamical times when the walkers are ( weakly ) subdiffusive  i.e. , have one - sided bounds of order @xmath113 . in section  [ hausdorff ]",
    "we derive upper and lower bounds on the hausdorff dimension of the set of such exceptional dynamical times .",
    "some estimates for random walks that are needed for our arguments are given in appendix  [ appendix ] .",
    "the dynamics can be described , equivalently to the definition in section  [ intro ] , in the following manner . the initial configuration is set to @xmath115 , but now we place independent poisson clocks at each site @xmath20 that ring at rate @xmath116 . every time clocks ring we toss independent fair coins to decide on the values of @xmath117 after the ring .",
    "statistically the two descriptions are equivalent .",
    "the motivation for this second description is that it leads to a useful representation of the interaction between the discrete webs at different dynamical times @xmath0 and @xmath118 . in particular , let @xmath119 and @xmath120 be the walks starting at @xmath7 and defined for times @xmath121 , belonging to @xmath25 and @xmath114 .    if @xmath122 , then @xmath123 and @xmath124 are independent since the directions of the arrows at two distinct sites are independent . on the other hand , if @xmath125 , then the next steps of the two walks are now correlated .",
    "if the clock at the site @xmath126 did not ring on @xmath127 , then the two paths will coincide at time @xmath128 .",
    "if it rang at least once , then with probability @xmath129 they will coincide , and with probabily @xmath129 they wo nt .",
    "let us now define inductively a sequence of pairs of stopping times @xmath130 with @xmath131 and : @xmath132 on the interval of integer time @xmath133 $ ] , the paths @xmath134 coincide and at time @xmath135 they decide to separate with probability @xmath129 . in other words , from time @xmath136 , the walkers @xmath137 move independently until the next meeting time @xmath138 .",
    "hence , if we skip the intervals of time @xmath139 , @xmath140 behave as two independent random walks @xmath141 , while if we skip the intervals @xmath142 , the two walks coincide with a single random walk @xmath143 . furthermore , since @xmath143 is constucted from the arrow configuration at different sites than the ones used to construct @xmath141 , it is independent of @xmath141 ; and @xmath144 are i.i.d .",
