    "following cosmological recombination at a redshift @xmath9 , the baryonic gas filling up the universe became predominantly neutral . given that this gas is known to be mostly ionized today",
    ", one arrives at two of the major questions in current extragalactic astronomy : _ (",
    "i ) when were the cosmic hydrogen and helium re - ionized ? _ and _ ( ii ) which sources dominated this reionization process ? _ the answers to both questions are likely to be different for hydrogen and helium ( see review by barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "recent observations provide preliminary answers to the first question .",
    "the absorption spectra of sdss quasars at @xmath5 indicate that the neutral fraction of hydrogen increases significantly at @xmath10 ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the uv spectrum of quasars implies that helium is fully ionized only at @xmath11 ( jacobsen et al 1994 ; tytler 1995 ; davidsen et al . 1996 ; hogan et al . 1997 ; reimers et al . 1997 ; heap et al .",
    "2000 ; kriss et al . 2001 ; smette et al .",
    "the latter observations also indicate , through a cross - correlation between the hydrogen and helium forest of absorption lines ( kriss et al .",
    "2001 ; smette et al .",
    "2002 ) , that the ionization of helium at @xmath12 had significant contributions from both quasars and stars .",
    "no analogous evidence exists for hydrogen at @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we make theoretical predictions for the reionization histories of hydrogen and helium .",
    "we calculate the contribution from quasars using a model that matches all the existing observational data on the quasar luminosity function at high redshifts ( see wyithe & loeb 2002 for details ) .",
    "we model the less constrained stellar contribution using two free parameters , which are in turn constrained by existing observational data .",
    "since the recombination times of both hydrogen and helium are shorter than the age of the universe in overdense regions of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , it is possible that these species experienced more than one epoch of reionization .",
    "one of the goals of our detailed study is to identify the parameter values for which multiple reionization epochs are possible .",
    "the reionization history has important implications for the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "anisotropies on scales smaller than the angular size of the horizon at hydrogen reionization are suppressed by a factor @xmath13 where @xmath7 is the line - of - sight optical depth for electron scattering ( hu & white 1997 ; haiman & loeb 1997 ) , and secondary anisotropies are added ( hu 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "reionization is the primary source of polarization anisotropies on large angular scales ( zaldarriaga & seljak 1997 ; kamionkowski et al .",
    "1997 ; hu 2000 ) .",
    "polarization anisotropies might be detected in the near future by map on large angular scales ( kaplinghat 2002 ) or by ground - based experiments on small angular scales .",
    "so far , the available data on the temperature anisotropies of the cmb provides an upper limit of @xmath14 ( wang , tegmark & zaldarriaga 2002 ; bond et al .",
    "we will use this upper limit to constrain the free parameters of our model .    throughout the paper we assume",
    "density parameters values of @xmath15 in matter , @xmath16 in baryons , @xmath17 in a cosmological constant , and a hubble constant of @xmath18 ( or equivalently @xmath19 ) . for calculations of the press - schechter  ( 1974 )",

    "( 1986 ) . unless otherwise noted we adopt an rms amplitude of @xmath21 for mass density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath22mpc",
    "the simplest estimate of the epoch of reionization is based on the following simple considerations . given",
    "a co - moving density of ionizing photons @xmath23 in a homogeneous but clumpy medium of comoving density @xmath24 ( where the size of the hii region is much larger than the scale length of clumpiness ) , the evolution of the volume filling factor @xmath25 of ionized regions is ( haiman & loeb  1997 ; madau et al .  1999 ; barkana & loeb  2001 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the case b recombination coefficient , @xmath28 is the scale factor , @xmath29 is the comoving electron density , and @xmath30 is the clumping factor .",
    "this equation describes statistically the transition from a fully neutral universe to a fully ionized one , and yields reionization redshifts for hydrogen of around 7 - 12 .",
    "large uncertainties arise in both the source term and in the value of the clumping factor ( because more rapid recombinations lead to a slower evolution of @xmath31 ) .    a more realistic description of reionization in a clumpy medium is provided by the model of miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in what follows ,",
    "we draw primarily from their prescription and refer the reader to the original paper for a detailed discussion of its motivations and assumptions .",
    "the model assumes that reionization progresses rapidly through islands of lower density prior to the overlap of individual cosmological ionized regions .",
    "following overlap , the remaining regions of high density are gradually ionized .",
    "it is therefore hypothesized that at any time , regions with gas below some critical overdensity @xmath32 are ionized while regions of higher density are not .",
    "the assumption of homogeneity in equation  ( [ fillfactor ] ) implies that the volume filling factor equals the mass filling factor .",
    "therefore , within the model of miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we replace @xmath33 by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fraction of mass in regions with overdensity below @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the volume weighted probability distribution for @xmath38 .",
    "the product @xmath39 can be rewritten @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fraction of the volume with @xmath42 .",
    "the quantity @xmath43 is therefore the number of recombinations per atom in the igm per second .",
    "note that the term analogous to the clumping factor is calculated from the volume weighted distribution .",
    "the mass fraction @xmath44 ( or equivalently @xmath36 ) therefore evolves according to the equation @xmath45 this equation assumes that all ionizing photons are absorbed shortly after being emitted , so that there is no background ionizing field , and no loss of ionizing photons due to redshift .",
    "we therefore implicitly assume that the mean free path of ionizing photons is much smaller than the hubble length .",
    "this should be valid at redshifts not too much smaller than the overlap redshift .",
    "the integration of equation  ( [ postoverlap ] ) requires knowledge of @xmath37 .",
    "miralda - escude et al .  (",

    "they assume @xmath52 , which corresponds to the distribution of densities of an isothermal sphere , and solve for @xmath53 and @xmath54 by requiring the mass and volume to be normalized to unity .",
    "we repeat this procedure to find @xmath37 at higher redshifts .",
    "the proportionality of @xmath55 to the scale factor is expected for the growth of structure in an @xmath56 universe or at high redshift otherwise , and its amplitude should depend on the amplitude of the power - spectrum . the simulations on which the distribution in miralda - escude et al .",

    "a more accurate model to describe the evolution of the ionized volume prior to overlap was suggested by miralda - escude et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in our notation",
    "the appropriate equation is @xmath60}{dz } = \\frac{1}{n^0}\\frac{dn_{\\gamma}}{dz } - \\alpha_{\\rm b}(1+z)^3r(\\delta_{\\rm crit})n_{\\rm e}q_{\\rm i}\\frac{dt}{dz}.\\ ] ] or @xmath61\\frac{q_{\\rm i}}{f_{\\rm m}(\\delta_{\\rm crit})}.\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath31 is redefined to be the volume filling factor within which all matter at densities below @xmath62 has been ionized . within this formalism",
    ", the epoch of overlap is precisely defined as the time when @xmath31 reaches unity .",
    "however , we have only a single equation to describe the evolution of two independent quantities @xmath25 and @xmath63 .",
    "the relative growth of these depends on the luminosity function and spatial distribution of the sources .",
    "the appropriate value of @xmath62 is set by the mean free path of the ionizing photons .",
    "more numerous sources can attain overlap for smaller values of @xmath64 .",
    "assuming @xmath62 to be constant with redshift , we find that results do not vary much ( less than 10% in the optical depth to electron scattering ) for values of @xmath62 ranging from a few to a few tens . at high redshift , these @xmath62 correspond to mean free paths comparable to the typical separations between galaxies or quasars .",
    "we assume @xmath65 ( which lies between the values for galaxies and quasars ) throughout the remainder of this paper .",

    "the ionizing radiation field is described by the comoving densities of ionizing photons for ionized hydrogen , singly ionized helium and doubly ionized helium , namely @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively .",

    "two classes of sources , quasars and stars , contribute to the ionizing radiation field .",
    "we discuss these in turn in the following subsections .      to calculate the comoving density of ionizing photons emitted by quasars , @xmath98 , we integrate over both the quasar luminosity function and over the mean quasar spectrum ( specified in schirber & bullock  2002 ) . given the b - band quasar luminosity function @xmath99 at redshift @xmath100 in units of @xmath101 , we find for example @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the planck constant , and @xmath104 is the luminosity in units of @xmath105 of a quasar with a b - band luminosity @xmath106 . at redshifts below @xmath107 we use the luminosity function of boyle et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . at @xmath108",
    "we use the theoretical luminosity function of wyithe & loeb  ( 2002 ) ; the reader is referred to the original paper for more details .",
    "this quasar evolution model successfully describes all known properties of the high redshift quasar luminosity function ( fan et al .",
    "2001a , b ) , and reproduces measurements of the black - hole / dark matter halo mass relation ( ferrarese  2002 ) as well as estimates of the quasar duty cycle ( steidel et al .  2002 ) . since quasars at high redshift appear similar to typical examples at low redshift ( fan et al .",
    "2001b ) , the luminosity function fully determines the ionizing radiation field .",
    "we therefore have almost no freedom in our calculation of the ionizing radiation field from quasars at high redshifts .",
    "this allows us to explore the effect of different stellar radiation fields on the reionization history of the universe .      to compute the comoving densities of stellar ionizing photons , @xmath109",

    "we also consider a second evolution for the stellar ionizing field , denoted hereafter as case b. a recent study ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2002 ) has shown that in a large sample of local galaxies , the ratio @xmath131 ( where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the total stellar and dark matter halo masses respectively ) scales as @xmath134 for @xmath135 , but is constant for larger stellar masses .",
    "note that the star - formation efficiency is proportional to @xmath136 .",
    "since star - formation is thought to be regulated by supernova feedback ( dekel & silk 1986 ) , the important quantity is the depth of the galactic potential well , or equivalently the halo circular velocity . using the stellar mass tully - fisher relation of bell & de jong  ( 2001 )",
    ", we find the threshold circular velocity @xmath137 that at @xmath138 corresponds to a stellar mass of @xmath139 . in this case",

    "a and b we make the distinction between the ionizing radiation field due to a possible early population of zero - metallicity stars , and the metal enriched stars observed at lower redshifts .",
    "it is thought that the primordial initial mass function favored massive stars ( bromm , copi & larson  1999 , 2001 ; abel , bryan & norman  2000 ; mackey , bromm , hernquist  2002 ) .",
    "the possible existence of this population is very important for reionization because the spectrum of these stars would result in an order of magnitude more ionizing photons per baryon incorporated into stars ( bromm , kudritzki , & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the formation of the very massive stars was suppressed as the material out of which stars form was enriched with metals .",
    "the fraction of the ionizing photons produced by metal - free stars depends on several unknown parameters , including the mixing efficiency of metals , the environments in which new stars form , and most importantly , the threshold metallicity above which star formation is transformed from being dominated by massive stars to a scalo  ( 1998 ) initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the threshold metallicity is believed to be small ; bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argue for a threshold @xmath154 of the solar metallicity value .",
    "the efficiency of mixing of metal enriched outflows from star forming galaxies to the surrounding igm is even more uncertain ; scannapieco , ferrara & madau  ( 2002 ) find that the mass weighted mean metallicity can reach values greater than @xmath155 of the solar value at redshifts as high as 20 , and note that the average metallicity scales with star formation efficiency , supernovae rate , and the fraction of supernovae energy that is channeled into outflows .",
    "the average metallicity increases roughly exponentially with redshift as it is modulated by the exponential growth in the collapse fraction of baryons at high redshifts .",
    "since the first metals were produced by supernovae , it is reasonable to suppose that the enrichment of the igm with metals at redshift @xmath100 is proportional to the mass of baryons that has formed stars by that redshift .",
    "the average metallicity at a redshift @xmath100 can then be written as @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a constant .",
    "note that the baryonic collapse fraction @xmath158 , which is computed from equation  ( [ fb ] ) is affected by the reionization history .",
    "the formation of metal - rich stars is assumed to be proportional to the average metalicity , with the fraction reaching unity when the average metalicity of the igm reaches @xmath159 . before @xmath160 reaches  @xmath159 we may approximate the fraction of star formation at redshift @xmath100 that is in zero - metallicity stars to be @xmath161 , while after @xmath160 reaches @xmath159 we may assume all star formation to have a scalo  ( 1998 ) imf .",
    "for a given star formation efficiency and escape fraction , the above prescription yields a characteristic redshift for the build - up of the threshold metal enrichment .",
    "the exponential growth in the collapse fraction with redshift implies that the evolution in the mode of star formation resembles a step - function .",
    "we therefore define a transition redshift @xmath6 below which metal - rich stars with a scalo  ( 1998 ) imf dominate the production rate of ionizing photons .    through most of the paper we present results in terms of @xmath0 , but",
    "return to a justification of this choice in ",
    "[ justification ] . at redshifts above @xmath6 ,",
    "we use values of @xmath110 calculated for each of the three species @xmath83 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 assuming massive ( @xmath164 ) zero - metallicity stars and the generic spectrum calculated by bromm , kudritzki & loeb  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath165 are @xmath166 for h@xmath72 , @xmath167 for @xmath162 and @xmath168 for @xmath163 . at lower redshifts we assume metal enriched stars ( 1/20th solar metallicity ) with a scalo  ( 1998 ) mass - function , and",
    "use spectral information from the stellar population model of leitherer et al .",
    "this results in values of @xmath169 for h@xmath72 , @xmath170 for @xmath162 and @xmath171 for @xmath163 .",
    "the typical distance that an ionizing photon of neutral helium can travel through neutral hydrogen having a cross - section @xmath172 before the optical depth reaches unity is the absorption mean - free - path @xmath173 , where @xmath174 we find @xmath175^{-3}$]kpc .",
    "this distance is much shorter than @xmath176mpc which is the typical size of an hii region around a @xmath177 halo prior to reionization ( barkana & loeb  2000 ) .",
    "therefore , at @xmath178 the @xmath162 propagation front can only lead the @xmath83 propagation front by a small fraction of the size of the hii region , and the excess @xmath179 ionizing photons photo - ionize additional hydrogen . on the other hand , most ionizing photons for hydrogen ( @xmath180hz )",
    "are not absorbed by helium , and so the expansion of the hii region is not inhibited by the presence of helium . obviously , due to the absence of singly ionized helium the @xmath181 front can not propagate beyond the @xmath182 front .    following these considerations ,",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] provides a schematic representation of the three epochs in reionization history .",
    "in this section we derive reionization histories for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath188 .",
    "these histories are shown in figures  [ fig2 ] ( for case a star - formation ) and [ fig3 ] ( for case b star - formation ) .",
    "for case a we show results for combinations of @xmath189 and 0.005 , and @xmath190 and 20.0 .",
    "we note the following features .",
    "large values of @xmath191 allow the massive zero metallicity stars to reionize both hydrogen and helium in the universe at very early times .",
    "if the zero metallicity stars do not reionize helium , quasars result in the overlap of heii regions by @xmath192 , consistent with observations showing transmission just blueward of the helium ly@xmath193 line at @xmath194 ( jacobsen et al 1994 ; tytler 1995 ; davidsen et al .",
    "1996 ; hogan et al .",

    "2002 ) as well as evidence for a temperature rise in the igm at @xmath195 indicating the reionization of helium at that time ( schaye et al . 2000 ; theuns et al . 2002 ) .",
    "interestingly , we also find that it is possible for hydrogen and/or helium to have been reionized twice .",
    "this situation arises if the zero - metallicity stars reionize the universe prior to @xmath6 , but below @xmath0 the recombination rate is sufficiently high that the softer spectra of normal stars can not maintain overlap .",
    "overlap of hii regions is then re - achieved at a later time as the collapse fraction grows and the density of the igm is lowered . a second overlap of heii regions results from the rise in quasar activity at @xmath196 .",
    "similar results are found in case b , for values of @xmath191 that are a factor of @xmath197 larger than in case a.    we would like to reiterate the point that multiple reionization epochs occur for some sets of parameters as a result of multiple peaks in the emissivity of ionizing photons as a function of cosmic time . in such cases the first emissivity peak occurs at @xmath6 , at which point it drops due to the softer spectra of metal enriched stars .",
    "later , when the collapsed fraction of baryons has reached a sufficiently high value , the resulting increase in emissivity further reionizes the igm . as we will show in   [ justification ] , this double peaked behavior is still seen if a smoothly varying fraction of collapsed objects at metallicities below the threshold produce the hard spectra rather than sources emitting prior to a fixed @xmath6 .",
    "a double peaked emissivity will always arise so long as the relevant metal enrichment time is less than the time required for the collapse fraction to change by a factor equal to the ratio between the emissivities of the first generation of stars and subsequent metal enriched stars . from numerical simulations . ]",
    "there are two small , sharp jumps in the reionization histories that are artifacts , but warrant explanation .",
    "the first is in the evolution of @xmath198 immediately following the overlap of heiii regions .",
    "this small jump ( note that the curve is smooth , not discontinuous ) arises because our formalism demands @xmath199 at this epoch .",
    "however following the overlap of he@xmath73 , the he@xmath95 front is free to rapidly expand , powered by the strong ionizing radiation field , and the mass fraction @xmath200 therefore grows until the he@xmath95 front reaches the h@xmath72 front .",
    "the second jump occurs at @xmath107 where we switch from computation of the ionizing flux due to quasars using the model quasar luminosity function , to calculation using the empirical luminosity function .",
    "neither is a perfect description around this redshift , and there is a discontinuous jump in the luminosity density , and hence in the ionizing radiation density , resulting in a jump in the reionization histories .    at early times the rise in temperature associated with reionization curtails star - formation .",
    "the effect of this is clearly seen in panel ( a ) of figure  [ fig2 ] . here",
    "the zero metallicity stars rapidly increase the ionized fraction , but as @xmath66 approaches unity , the ionizing flux is reduced , and the rate of reionization slows .",
    "this feature is not seen in cases where overlap occurs at lower redshift ( e.g. panel ( d ) in figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "many combinations of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath188 predict significant reionization without overlap due to the early presence of metal - free stars , resulting in a peak in the ionized fraction centered on the transition redshift , followed by recombinations before further reionization due to normal stars and quasars .",
    "we term these peaks _ failed overlaps_. in section ",
    "[ visability ] we show that these failed overlaps leave a significant imprint on the visibility function for electron scattering of cmb photons",
    ".      different reionization histories result in different densities of electrons as a function of redshift .",

    "on the other hand , if the product @xmath191 is too small , then the ionizing radiation field will be too weak for the hii regions to overlap by @xmath205 . if the transition redshift @xmath6 is large , then @xmath191 may obtain higher values since the harder spectra of metal free stars are only available to the ionizing radiation field at high redshifts when the igm is dense and the collapse fraction is small",
    ". however if @xmath6 is low , then @xmath191 may take smaller values and still result in overlap of hii regions by @xmath205 .",
    "in addition to the above constraints , observations suggest that the igm was metal enriched by @xmath205 ( songaila 2001 ) to a level that would lead to a scalo stellar mass function ( bromm et al .",

    "the regions excluded by the aforementioned constraints are shaded grey . for our case a star - formation model we find that @xmath207 if @xmath208 . for a higher @xmath6 , we find that larger values of @xmath188 are possible .",

    "we find that the lower limits on @xmath188 are larger by a factor of @xmath213 for our case b star - formation model .",
    "however since the intensity of the stellar radiation field is curtailed by feedback at high redshift in this model , we find that @xmath191 can be as large as @xmath214 for @xmath215 , or even larger for @xmath216 .",
    "interestingly , the contours for @xmath7 and @xmath217 are not parallel .",
    "a significant range of @xmath7 exist for different @xmath6 ( particularly where case a star - formation is assumed ) .",
    "this indicates that measurement of optical depth does not determine the overlap redshift .",
    "we discuss the reason for this puzzling result in   [ visability ] .    in   [ histories ] we mentioned that hydrogen and/or helium could be reionized twice , and showed examples of reionization histories that exhibit this behavior . in figures",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we show contours of the overlap redshift for hydrogen ( left panels ) , and helium ( right panels ) , for case a and case b star - formation models .",
    "the redshift of the most recent overlap is described by the dark contours . at high values of @xmath6 and low values of @xmath188 ,",
    "the overlap redshift is almost independent of star - formation since then quasars dominate the ionizing radiation field .",
    "this is particularly true for helium , which is ionized by quasars at @xmath192 in the absence of any stellar ionizing radiation .",
    "cases where there was an additional earlier overlap are denoted by the grey contours .",
    "the region of the @xmath218 $ ] plane that results in multiple overlap epochs is shaded grey .",
    "we see that this area covers a significant portion of parameter space , and therefore that it is quite possible the universe was reionized twice .",
    "the contours representing the upper limit of @xmath3 , and the lower limit for the overlap redshift @xmath219 are also shown ( thick dashed lines ) . as mentioned earlier , parameters in the region between these limits",
    "are not excluded by current observations .",
    "the visibility function @xmath220 describes the probability that an observed photon was scattered between conformal times @xmath221 and @xmath222 @xmath223(1+z)^2e^{-\\tau_{\\rm es}},\\ ] ] where @xmath224 , @xmath7 is the optical depth from redshift 0 to @xmath100 and the @xmath201 are mass filling factors .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the visibility function is peaked during the recombination era , with a second , lower amplitude , but broader peak coinciding with the epoch of overlap of hii regions .",
    "however we have found that overlap may have occurred on multiple occasions , and that many combinations of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath188 predict significant reionization without overlap ( _ failed overlap _ ) at high redshift due to the early presence of metal - free stars . during these failed overlaps , examples of which",
    "are shown in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , the ionization fraction can be significant .",
    "following a failed overlap at @xmath6 , recombinations dominate the evolution and the ionization fraction drops before further reionization ensues due to normal stars and quasars .",
    "the higher cosmic density at early times might more than compensate for the smaller ionization fraction , so that the peak of the visibility function does not coincide with the epoch of reionization .",
    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "figures  [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] show visibility functions corresponding to the sample reionization histories shown in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "generally , if the early metal - free stars succeed in achieving reionization , then the peak in the visibility function coincides with this overlap epoch ( e.g. case a in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] )",
    ". however the optical depth @xmath7 is large and many of these cases are already excluded by cmb measurements . of the 8 cases shown in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , those that exhibit failed overlap have visibility peaks that coincide with this failed overlap , rather than with the actual reionization epoch .",
    "_ thus , the visibility function may probe the nature of the early generation of stars rather than the reionization epoch itself .",
    "_    the reionized gas during a failed overlap will be in bubbles .",
    "gruzinov & hu  ( 1998 ) have pointed out that a universe which is ionized in patches induces additional cmb anisotropies on arc - minute scales .",
    "thus , patchy reionization due to a failed overlap at high redshifts will modify the shape of the small - scale power spectrum of cmb anisotropies .",
    "however , the amplitude of the added secondary anisotropies was predicted to be at a level well below the feature in the spectrum detected more recently by the cosmic background imager ( padin et al  2001 ) .",
    "this feature was explained by bond et al .",
    "( 2002 ) as being due to the foreground sunyaev - zeldovich effect from x - ray clusters .",
    "as mentioned in   [ stars ] we have approximated the evolution in the mode of star formation as a step function .",
    "that is , we have assumed that the production rate of ionizing photons in the universe is transformed sharply at @xmath6 from being dominated by massive , metal - free stars to being dominated by metal - rich stars with a scalo imf . in this section",
    "we justify this approach by comparing its results to those obtained with a scheme involving gradual metal enrichment of the igm as described in ",
    "[ stars ] by equation  ( [ gradualenrich ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] shows two sample reionization histories computed using the gradual enrichment scheme , together with the resulting visibility function .",
    "the examples correspond to panels a ) and c ) for case b star formation in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the thick grey line in these panels shows the fraction of star formation resulting in a scalo  ( 1998 ) mass function as a function of redshift .  in each of these cases the value of @xmath157 ( listed in the figure )",
    "produces around 50% scalo  ( 1998 ) imf star formation at the previously used redshift @xmath6 . note the different values of @xmath225 , and the different histories of the collapsed mass - fraction .",
    "the features discussed for the corresponding examples in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig9 ] are still present in figure  [ fig10 ] . these include the double overlap of he  iii in a ) , and the non - coincidence of the overlap redshift of hii and the peak in the visibility function in b ) .",
    "furthermore , we find unchanged values of @xmath7 .",
    "these calculations appear to justify our use of a single parameter @xmath6 to characterize the reionization histories and visibility functions .",
    "we have explored the reionization histories of hydrogen and helium due to stars and quasars .",
    "the results were analyzed as a function of the two free parameters in our model , namely : ( i ) the transition redshift , @xmath0 , above which the stellar population is dominated by massive , zero metallicity stars ; and ( ii ) the product of the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the star - formation efficiency , @xmath226 .",
    "the quasar model was not varied since it provides an excellent fit to all existing data on the luminosity function of quasars up to redshift @xmath227 ( wyithe & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show sample reionization histories for different choices of @xmath6 and @xmath188 .",
    "we find that a wide range of @xmath228 is allowed for @xmath229 if the star - formation efficiency does not depend on galaxy mass ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) or @xmath230 if the efficiency is suppressed in low mass galaxies ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this wide range satisfies the constraints that overlap of the hii regions must be achieved by @xmath5 ( fan et al 2002 ) and that the optical depth for electron scattering must be limited to @xmath3 .",
    "the allowed range leads generically to @xmath8 ( see figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the map satellite is expected to have sufficient sensitivity to detect values of @xmath7 as small as @xmath231 ( kaplinghat et al .",
    "2002 ) , well below this range of expected values .",
    "a major fraction of the allowed range of @xmath191 and @xmath0 leads to an early peak in the ionized fraction due to metal - free stars at high redshifts",
    ". often this peak results in a small but significant filling factor that is subsequently reduced ( temporarily ) due to recombination . in a restricted range of the allowed parameter values",
    ", we find that either hydrogen or helium experience two overlap epochs , separated by recombination ( see shaded regions in figures  [ fig6 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "that helium might have been reionized twice due to the presence of early very massive stars was previously pointed out by oh et al .",
    "the first overlap phase is caused by the population of zero - metallicity , massive stars and the second is dominated by the quasars for helium or by stars and quasars for hydrogen . even if early overlap is not achieved , the peak in the visibility function for scattering of the cmb often coincides with the early partial ionization peak rather than with the actual reionization epoch ( see figures  [ fig7 ] and [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath7 is therefore larger than expected based the reionization redshift alone .",
    "thus , the cmb visibility function may be probing the nature of the early generation of stars rather than the reionization epoch itself .",
    "future cmb experiments , such as map and planck , will provide tighter constraints on @xmath7 and will reduce the range of allowed @xmath188 in our model ( see figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) . any additional observational data on the composition of the stellar population or the abundance of hei or heii at @xmath232",
