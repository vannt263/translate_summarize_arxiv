    "mesoscopic superconducting circuits in which there is an interplay between josephson tunneling and electrostatic charging effects display a wide range of interesting behaviors . the quantum coherence and non - linearity generated by josephson junctions",
    "make superconducting circuits obvious candidates for qubits.@xcite however , the usefulness of qubits depends strongly on the extent to which the level of dissipation and the attendant decoherence can be minimized.@xcite in contrast , there are many other applications of superconducting circuits , as measuring devices@xcite or as coolers,@xcite where irreversible transport is necessary and hence dissipation plays an essential positive role .",
    "the superconducting single electron transistor@xcite ( sset ) is an example of a superconducting device with applications where both coherence and dissipation are important .",
    "the sset consists of a small superconducting island linked to superconducting leads by josephson junctions . a voltage gate coupled to the island",
    "can be used to control the flow of charge .",
    "the strong dependence of the charge transport through the sset island on the properties of the gate makes it an ideal sensing device ; it can act as either an electrometer@xcite or , ( when the gate is mechanically compliant ) as a displacement detector.@xcite sensing typically involves a coupling between the sset island charge and the degree of freedom being measured , hence the charge noise spectrum@xcite determines the back - action of the sset on the measured system ( within the linear response regime ) .",
    "although the back - action is a nuisance in the context of measurement , it can be used to manipulate the state of the measured system:@xcite one recent experiment used the back - action from a sset to cool a nanomechanical resonator,@xcite whilst another demonstrated the production of laser - like states of self - sustained oscillation in an electrical resonator.@xcite from another perspective the back - action of the sset can be seen as providing an efficient means of probing its quantum noise properties.@xcite    the sset supports a wide range of different current carrying processes depending on the choice of operating point.@xcite when a large voltage is applied ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the superconducting gap ) , it becomes energetically favorable to break up the cooper - pairs and the transport is dominated by inelastic ( incoherent ) tunneling of quasiparticles at both junctions . at lower voltages",
    "the transport involves josephson tunneling of cooper - pairs , though dissipation is still required to generate a dc current . in the regime where @xmath2 , current resonances known as the josephson quasiparticle@xcite ( jqp ) and double josephson quasiparticle@xcite ( djqp ) cycles combine coherent cooper - pair tunneling and dissipative quasiparticle tunneling .",
    "the jqp and djqp cycles have attracted much recent attention as the resonant and ( partly ) coherent nature of the transport leads to measurement sensitivities approaching the quantum limit , as well as a range of interesting back - action effects.@xcite    in this article we focus instead on cooper - pair resonances@xcite which occur at even lower voltages than the jqp and djqp cycles and involve the coherent transfer of one or more cooper - pairs across the two sset junctions . at these lower voltages quasiparticles",
    "are almost completely absent and dissipation and decoherence are dominated by the electromagnetic environment of the sset .",
    "cooper - pair resonances are known to give rise to sharp features in the current voltage characteristics of the sset,@xcite though much less is known about their quantum noise properties .",
    "we develop a simple model for the sset system , valid at low voltages and for embedding circuits with resistances much less than the resistance quantum , @xmath3 .",
    "this model , which has important similarities with the standard description of resonance fluorescence of quantum optics , divides the energy levels of the system into pairs of resonant levels with the spacing within a doublet much less than the spacing between doublets.@xcite we derive the master equation of the sset within the born - markov approximations and then calculate both the average current and the charge noise spectrum in the vicinity of the cooper - pair resonances . the dominant feature in the charge noise spectrum is a triplet of peaks centered at zero frequency that is a characteristic of a driven two - level system,@xcite additional weaker triplets of peaks also occur at much higher frequencies .",
    "we also investigate the back - action that the cooper - pair resonances would have on an oscillator coupled to the sset island .",
    "the asymmetry in the triplet of peaks centered on zero frequency means that the resonances could be used to cool a mechanical resonator with frequency in the mhz range though not all the way down to its ground state .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe our model of the sset at low voltages , discussing the origin of the cooper - pair resonances and the way in which the electromagnetic environment couples to the charge passing through the transistor . then in sec .",
    "[ sec : me ] we show how the hamiltonian of the sset close to a cooper - pair resonance can be transformed to give a description in terms of a set of doublet states .",
    "we then use standard approximations to derive a master equation that describes the sset charge variables in the presence of dissipation due to the electromagnetic environment .",

    "josephson coupling links together adjacent members of the same ladder , but does not connect states from different ladders . assuming that quasiparticle tunneling ( which can link the ladders ) is negligible , we need only consider one of the sets of states .",

    "we further assume that the embedding circuit provides a low , real ( ohmic ) impedance , @xmath39 , such as would be generated by a transmission line.@xcite our description can easily be extended to take into account a finite impedance in series with the gate voltage,@xcite but since we take the limit @xmath40 this has a much weaker influence and so we neglect it here .    the voltage dependence of the charging energy leads to resonances where the eigenvalues of the charging hamiltonian , @xmath41 [ eq .  [ eqn : hch ] ] , become degenerate .",

    "the energy levels near the @xmath46 and @xmath47 resonances are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : presonances ] .    close to degeneracies in the charging energy the josephson coupling becomes important and the pairs of states @xmath25 and @xmath42 become strongly mixed forming doublets .",
    "the interaction with the environment can then cause the system to decay into the neighboring doublets with lower energy .",
    "taken together the coherent evolution and decay form a cascade in which @xmath30 increases systematically and hence a dc current flows . away from the resonances",
    "the coherent evolution is suppressed and decay processes can not take the system to ever higher @xmath30 values so the current is also suppressed .",
    "thus , the degeneracies in the charging energy lead to resonances in the current.@xcite the one exception to this picture arises for the @xmath46 resonance where one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : presonances](b ) that for voltages above resonance , @xmath48 , the system can move indefinitely to larger values of @xmath30 via incoherent decay processes alone and hence in this case the resonance becomes strongly broadened on one side.@xcite",
    "having seen how and where the cooper - pair resonances arise , we now proceed to obtain a detailed quantitative description of the charge dynamics of the sset that includes the dissipation and decoherence induced by the electromagnetic environment . as a first step we use a unitary transformation method to derive an effective hamiltonian which provides a systematic way of accounting for the coherent effect of the josephson coupling between resonant states .",
    "we then proceed to derive the master equation for the sset tracing out the environment using the born - markov approximations .",
    "the resulting master equation can then be used to derive a much simpler equation that describes just the sset island charge .",
    "close to the @xmath49-th cooper - pair resonance , and provided that the voltage , @xmath4 , is not too small , the eigenvalues of the sset charging hamiltonian are grouped into doublets , @xmath50 , with the spacing between members of a given doublet much less than the spacing between the doublets .",
    "the main effect of the josephson hamiltonian will be to introduce couplings between states within each doublet .",
    "since the full system hamiltonian can not be diagonalized exactly , we treat the josephson coupling as a perturbation and use a unitary transformation to derive an effective hamiltonian which takes into account the mixing it induces between states within a doublet.@xcite    we seek a unitary transformation , @xmath51 , such that , @xmath52 is block diagonal in the space of the doublets .",
    "this transformation is found as a perturbation series in @xmath53 , and we keep only the leading order contributions ( details are given in the appendix ) .",
    "this results in an effective system hamiltonian which is block - diagonal in the pairs of nearly - resonant states @xmath50 .",
    "each block takes the form , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the average charging energy of the resonant states , and @xmath56 is the high order coupling between the states . for @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 . for the case",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath60 .",
    "the splitting between resonant states , @xmath61 , is given by , @xmath62 the first term is the electrostatic energy difference between the states and the second term is a correction which arises at second order in the perturbation calculation@xcite .",

    "the block hamiltonians are diagonalized by a rotation , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the usual pauli matrix , to give the eigenstates of the doublets ,    @xmath66    [ eqn : eigenstates ]    and the corresponding eigenenergies , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is defined by    @xmath70    [ eqn : sincosalpha ]    and the energy level splitting is @xmath71 which changes sign at the resonance .",
    "note that the description of the system in terms of doublets is only valid within a region around each resonance .",

    "for states within the same doublet , this leads to dissipative transitions between the eigenstates ( intra - doublet transitions ) .",
    "the next non - zero contribution comes from terms of the form @xmath89 , which link states from a given doublet with states in the nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor doublets , leading to inter - doublet transitions .",
    "the same generic description applies to all the resonances with @xmath90 , but for the @xmath46 case the states in a given doublet only couple to one other doublet leading to a slightly different form for the master equation as we discuss below .    to calculate the inter - doublet terms we note that close to resonance the inter - doublet transitions occur on a much larger energy scale than the spacing between levels in the doublet , @xmath91",
    "this allows us to simplify the calculation by ignoring the @xmath56 terms in the block - diagonal hamiltonian [ eq .  ] and treat the charge states @xmath92 as the eigenstates of the system .",
    "thus , using the charge state basis , the inter - doublet contributions take the form    [ eqn : inter ] @xmath93    where we have assumed @xmath94 and the dephasing rate is given by @xmath95 with @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "the transition rates at the center of the resonance@xcite are given by @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "for the @xmath46 case there is only one decay channel linking different doublets , and the associated energy difference is @xmath100 .",
    "thus , provided @xmath101 the same set of inter - doublet terms is obtained , but with @xmath102 .    to calculate the terms in the master equation describing the intra - doublet transitions we need to use the full eigenstates of the system [ eq . ] and take account of the effects of the @xmath56 terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the energy differences between the states within a doublet can be much smaller than those between the doublets , and so in this case we include the effects of a finite temperature .",
    "this leads to the intra - doublet equations ,    [ eqn : intra ] @xmath103    where @xmath104 gives the transition rate between the states @xmath105 and @xmath106 within the @xmath30-th doublet .",

    "@xmath109 , it is possible to simplify the master equation significantly by applying a further rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "after this approximation the master equation takes the form ,    [ eqn : me ] @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112    where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the transition rates between the states @xmath116 , which are given by    @xmath117    we have also defined    @xmath118 \\frac{s_v(0)}{\\hbar^2 } , & \\delta k\\neq 0.\\end{array}\\right.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    for the rwa to be valid we require that incoherent decay rates are much smaller than the bohr frequency associated with the doublets , which , for @xmath57 , results in the condition @xmath119 ( since @xmath120 is the largest decay rate ) . from eqs .   and , we find that , @xmath121 . by tuning the gate voltage , @xmath122 can take on any value in the range @xmath123 , thus , for a given value of @xmath124 , the requirement that the rwa is valid puts a limit ( which becomes stricter as @xmath49 increases ) on the maximum voltage that can be considered .",
    "our interest here is in the regime where the sset charge dynamics is largely coherent , leading to sharp resonances in the current , and hence we naturally focus on the regime where the rwa is valid .",
    "since these conditions can only be met in practice@xcite for the lower values of @xmath49 , we will concentrate on the @xmath125 resonances .",
    "the master equations bear a strong resemblance to those which describe the radiative cascade of quantum optics.@xcite in the radiative cascade a laser field drives a two - level atom and when the field is treated quantum mechanically the eigenstates of the system are atom - field hybrids ( dressed states ) .",
    "decay processes lead to a cascade in which photons are emitted and the laser state moves progressively towards lower photon numbers .",
    "analogously in the sset the states @xmath126 are like the atom - laser dressed states , with the island charge states playing the role of the atom and @xmath30 like the state of the laser . in this case decay processes",
    "generate a cascade in which the system evolves towards states of ever increasing @xmath30 .      although the full master equation for the sset is rather complicated , it is possible to derive a much simpler set by tracing over the charges that have passed through the sset . defining a set of reduced coherences,@xcite @xmath127 and carrying out the trace over @xmath30",

    "the resulting master equation describes a two - level system ( tls ) which is both driven and damped .",
    "this simple two - level description is all that is required to calculate the main charge noise properties of the sset .",
    "the full density operator does not have a steady state , the system cascades to increasing values of @xmath30 as charge tunnels though the transistor .",

    "note that here and in what follows we drop the superscripts on @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the case @xmath134 .",
    "as a first application of the master equation , we calculate the steady state average current , @xmath141 , through the transistor .",

    "the only non - zero terms after performing the trace come from the dissipative parts of the diagonal master equations [ eqs .   ] which give rise to the incoherent transitions .",
    "since these terms only depend on the reduced coherences of the system , the current reaches a well - defined steady - state in the long time limit , @xmath145 within the regime where the rwa is valid , this matches the results obtained previously@xcite using a rate equation approach and fermi s golden rule .    the current near the @xmath46 and @xmath47 resonances is shown in fig .  [ fig : current ] for the typical parameter values@xcite @xmath146@xmath78ev , @xmath147mk , a resistance for the embedding circuit @xmath148@xmath149 and we have set @xmath150 [ we use these parameters throughout for the numerical calculations ] .",

    "[ fig : current](a ) ] .",
    "the two resonances show rather different characteristics .",
    "the current around the @xmath46 resonance is broad and highly asymmetric .",
    "this is because in this case purely dissipative processes can generate a dc current for @xmath151 ( incoherent cooper - pair tunneling@xcite ) as can be seen from the energy level diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : presonances](b ) .",
    "the current for the @xmath47 resonance is much closer to the standard lorentzian form of a resonance , the small amount of asymmetry still present arises from the intra - doublet transitions . for @xmath152 , relaxation between the levels of the doublets ( controlled by @xmath153 ) hinders current flow whilst for @xmath151 it helps it .",
    "this leads to a small asymmetry in the current as a function of voltage which is only removed when the temperature is sufficiently high such that @xmath154 and a lorentzian shape is recovered .    extending our calculation to include the regime where the rwa is no longer valid , we find that the current peaks at the resonances become suppressed .",
    "this is because outside of the rwa the system is unable to build up the coherence between charge states necessary for current to flow .",
    "this is consistent with ref .   where this effect was studied in detail .",
    "we now turn to consider the noise properties of the sset close to the cooper - pair resonances .",

    "[ fig : gammanbar ] we plot the damping , @xmath183 , for @xmath187mhz and @xmath188ghz .",
    "the small asymmetry in the low frequency noise spectrum gives the damping a very small magnitude , but for the high frequency resonator it is much larger .",
    "the lack of symmetry in the noise spectrum , @xmath198 , leads to quite different magnitudes for the damping at @xmath195 , with the anti - damping peak suppressed by the intra - doublet decays for both the high and low frequency cases .    when a resonator is coupled to the sset its steady state",
    "is determined by a combination of the back - action of the sset and the influence of the rest of the resonator s surroundings which are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath13 , and give rise to a damping rate @xmath199 .",
    "the overall occupation number of the resonator , @xmath200 , is given by the average,@xcite @xmath201 where @xmath202 .",
    "thus at a given @xmath13 , the sset can be used to cool the resonator provided provided @xmath203 .",
    "such cooling is important for nanomechanical resonators with frequencies in the mhz range as even at temperatures @xmath13 below @xmath189mk they will still contain a large number of thermal quanta.@xcite    figures [ fig : gammanbar](c ) and [ fig : gammanbar](d ) show the behavior of @xmath184 ( plotted as @xmath204 to emphasize the behavior near minimas ) around the resonance at @xmath189mhz and @xmath190ghz . for @xmath187mhz , the minimum in @xmath184 occurs when the system is tuned directly to resonance where the central peak in the noise spectrum vanishes . for the typical device parameters we have chosen ( given in sec .  [ sec : current ] )",
    ", we find a minimum of @xmath205 which corresponds through the expression @xmath206 to an effective temperature @xmath207mk , only slightly lower than the bath temperature , @xmath147mk .",
    "this result is , however , dependent on @xmath13 through the intra - doublet rates and the relative cooling potential does improve at higher bath temperatures , for example @xmath208mk for @xmath209mk and @xmath210mk for @xmath211mk .",
    "the main problem with using the sset tuned to a cooper - pair resonance to cool a mechanical resonator is the spacing of the peaks in the noise spectrum . for effective cooling",
    ", we need the frequency of the resonator to match the separation of the peaks .",
    "this can not be achieved at low frequencies in this device since the minimum intra - doublet spacing ( and hence minimum peak splitting ) @xmath212 is in the ghz range .",
    "trying to engineer a device where this splitting was much smaller would lead to a deterioration in the effectiveness of the cooling because of the effect of thermal noise on the sset itself : the asymmetry in the peaks would be reduced and they would also be broadened ( this would take the system outside both the regime where the rwa is valid and also the resolved sideband limit where optimal cooling can be achieved@xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , for a driven tls@xcite the potential for cooling is much greater as it is possible to tune the drive ( which corresponds to the josephson coupling in our system ) and it is the _ difference _ between this frequency and the level separation of the tls(both of which can be @xmath213 ) that sets the spacing of the sidepeaks in the corresponding noise spectrum .",
    "the full charge noise spectrum also contains contributions at other frequencies far from @xmath214 .",
    "these arise from the higher order contributions in the perturbative expansion of @xmath157 . in this section",
    "we investigate the most significant of these high order terms , which arises from the @xmath215 term in the expansion .",
    "the form of @xmath216 is calculated in the appendix , @xmath217 for @xmath90 , in the case @xmath46 the first term is not present . when this is transformed to the eigenstate basis",
    "it contains terms proportional to @xmath218 , with @xmath219 , for @xmath46 only terms @xmath220 are present . as an example we calculate the corresponding spectrum , @xmath221 for the @xmath47 resonance ( note that in the steady state @xmath222 and so we do not need to work with the operator @xmath223 ) . to do this we use the regression theorem and the reduced master equations [ eq .  ] with the values of @xmath224 .",
    "we find that the spectrum consists of triplets of peaks centered on the frequencies @xmath225 with the sidepeaks separated by the intra - doublet level spacing in each case .",
    "the triplets with @xmath226 and @xmath227 simply differ by a constant prefactor and a slight modification to the decay rates and so we concentrate here on just the @xmath226 case . the spectrum around @xmath228 is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : n1n1](a ) and [ fig : n1n1](b ) .",
    "the peaks in this part of the spectrum arise from first order josephson coupling between states at the relevant frequency differences .",
    "we show the relevant transitions and their frequencies in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1n1](c ) .",
    "since this spectrum occurs at higher order in the perturbation theory the magnitude of @xmath229 is much smaller than it was for the zeroth order spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cnomega ] ) .",
    "the central peak in both figs .",
    "[ fig : n1n1](a ) and [ fig : n1n1](b ) is the same because the transitions which give rise to these peaks always link corresponding states within the two doublets ( i.e.  an @xmath230 state with an @xmath230 state or a @xmath231 state with a @xmath231 ) for both the positive and negative frequency processes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n1n1](c ) .",
    "however , the sidepeaks of the two triplets are quite different . the weights of the sidepeaks are proportional to @xmath232 where @xmath233 and @xmath234 is the initial ( final ) state for the relevant transition .",
    "this means that each of the four sidepeaks has a different combination of matrix element and population .",
    "far from the resonance only one of the three peaks is present in each triplet . in this region",
    "the eigenstates are very close to the charge states and since the josephson effect only couples the states @xmath25 and @xmath235 we find that each state is only coupled to one other . very close to the resonance",
    "all of the peaks appear , the eigenstates are mixtures of charge states and so transitions between all of the states in the doublets can occur .",
    "the features seen in this part of the spectrum arise because the system is not as simple as a true tls , they arise from couplings between different doublets and hence require more than two energy levels .",
    "the frequencies at which the features in part of the spectrum occur , @xmath236ghz , are much larger than the range that can be probed with a stripline resonator .",
    "however , it might be possible to observe the noise at this frequency in a different kind of experiment in which the sset is instead coupled to another mesoscopic conductor such as a sis junction.@xcite",
    "we have analyzed the quantum dynamics of the sset tuned close to cooper - pair resonances .",
    "an effective hamiltonian for the sset was derived .",
    "this exploits the separation of the energy levels into doublets and accounts for the josephson coupling between resonant states .",
    "we then derived the master equations for the system including the effect of the electromagnetic environment using the born - markov approximations .",
    "we calculated the current in the vicinity of the resonances and find , in accord with previous studies , strong peaks at the resonances .",
    "calculating the charge noise spectrum in the vicinity of a resonance , we found that the spectrum is dominated by a triplet of peaks centered on zero frequency : a structure typical of a driven , damped , tls .",
    "however , the detailed form of the triplet in this case differed in important respects from a standard classically driven tls because of the intra - doublet transitions .",
    "an experimentally realizable method of measuring the quantum noise spectrum is to couple the sset to a resonator and measure the back - action . using a linear response approach we found that the effects of the intra - doublet relaxation can be observed in the asymmetry of the damping rate , @xmath183 , and effective occupation , @xmath184 , of the resonator . it would also be possible to cool a low frequency oscillator using a cooper - pair resonance , though not to the ground state as the large separation of the sidepeaks in the noise spectrum , @xmath212 , strongly limits the minimum occupation number that could be achieved .",
    "we also carried out a detailed calculation of the higher order triplet features that arise in the charge noise spectrum .",
    "these features occur because of the josephson coupling between different doublets .",
    "we thank miles blencowe for useful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to the british council ( u.k . ) and the french foreign affairs ministry ( france ) for financial support through the program phc alliance .",
    "additional support from the epsrc ( u.k . ) under grant ep / c540182/1 and anr ( france ) through contract jcjc-036 nemesis is also acknowledged .",
    "we begin with the system hamiltonian @xmath22 as defined in eqs .   and .",
    "we find a unitary transformation , @xmath237 ( we drop the subscript @xmath238 in this appendix ) , such that @xmath239 only contains diagonal elements and those which couple resonant states . to do this we define the projector onto the @xmath30-th doublet as @xmath240 then the condition on @xmath239 above becomes @xmath241 for @xmath242 .",
    "we then write the transformation as@xcite @xmath243 with @xmath244 and treat @xmath245 as a perturbation .",
    "this allows us to write a series expansion for @xmath238 in terms of @xmath53 , @xmath246 there are infinitely many transformations which satisfy the condition on @xmath239 and so to uniquely specify @xmath51 we choose that @xmath238 should not have matrix elements within the doublet , @xmath247 .",
    "we note that @xmath248 , since for the case @xmath249 we need no transformation .",
    "this then allows us to find the transformed form of the hamiltonian as @xmath250+[ij{s^{(1 ) } } , h_j ] \\\\ + [ ij^2 { s^{(2 ) } } , h_{\\text{ch}}]+\\frac{1}{2 ! } \\left [ ij{s^{(1 ) } } , [ ij{s^{(1 ) } } , h_{\\text{ch}}]\\right]+\\ldots,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] which we can then write as a power series @xmath251 where we have grouped terms by order in @xmath53 ;      these can then be used to construct the expression for @xmath238 term by term and so build up the effective hamiltonian . as an example we give the calculation of @xmath253 .",
    "we begin by noting that @xmath254 for all @xmath17 and @xmath242 which gives , @xmath255 from which we can calculate the matrix elements of @xmath256 as @xmath257 and the obvious conjugates . @xmath258 and @xmath259 then become the natural small parameters of the perturbation theory .",
    "these expressions can then be used to calculate @xmath260 and so on .",
    "this allows the transformed hamiltonian to be found up to any order , for example we find that the second order corrections to the diagonal elements are given by @xmath261 we also need to be able to calculate the off - diagonal coupling between resonant states , @xmath262 .",
    "this appears to order @xmath263 in the perturbation expansion .",
    "the method outlined above becomes very cumbersome at high orders and so to calculate @xmath262 for higher orders we introduce the level - shift operator@xcite @xmath264 where @xmath265 . which then allows us to calculate @xmath266 .",
    "this gives the expression found in eq .",
    "however , we have checked explicitly that this approach gives the same expression for @xmath267 ( the highest order used in the main text ) as that obtained using the perturbation expansion .",
    "we also need to transform the operators @xmath30 and @xmath17 . to illustrate the method we give an explicit calculation of @xmath84 .",
    "this is done in exact analogy with the calculation of @xmath239 .",
    "we first write @xmath84 as a power series , @xmath85 where ,                                                                                    we evaluate @xmath56 and the second order correction to @xmath61 using the resonance value for the voltage , @xmath44 , as these terms only give a significant contribution in the vicinity of the resonances when the electrostatic part of @xmath61 is small .",
    "making this approximation simplifies the calculation of the perturbation series .",
    "secular terms are those for which @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the coarse - graining timescale ( much larger than the correlation time of the environment , but much shorter than the timescale over which @xmath279 evolves ) over which the master equations are valid .",
    "only terms where @xmath76 are included since the smallest bohr frequency in the system is @xmath280 which we can safely assume is much larger than @xmath281 ,    in our calculations of the current and charge noise in the vicinity of the resonances we generally evaluate @xmath282 using the resonance value for the voltage , @xmath283 , as within the range of voltages over which the doublet picture is valid these quantities are typically very slowly varying ."
