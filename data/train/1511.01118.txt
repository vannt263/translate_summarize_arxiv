    "the origin of the stellar mass spectrum is thought to be closely related to star formation processes . and therefore the initial mass function ( imf )",
    ", the mass distribution of stars from a single star formation event , is a crucial diagnostic tool with which to understand star formation processes .    although the imf seems to be universal according to a number of previous studies ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bastian , covey , & meyer 2010 ) ) , many evidences for the variation of the imf have been reported both from observational and theoretical studies ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "one of main reasons for this debate may be caused by the use of inhomogeneous data .",
    "thus , we focus on the results from a homogeneous imaging survey of young open clusters in the galaxy ( `` sejong open cluster survey ''  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sung et al . 2013 ) ) .",
    "the young open clusters are useful objects in the study of the imf because they are not only a coeval and co - spatial population but also an ecological indicator in the galaxy .",
    "we investigated the imf of 16 famous young open clusters by analyzing their hertzsprung - russell diagrams .",
    "the upper left - hand panel of fig.[fig1 ] shows their imf and its slope @xmath5 ( the data from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lim 2014 ) , references therein , and ongoing work ) .",
    "variations of the slope @xmath5 with respect to the surface density and total mass of the clusters are shown in the upper right and lower left - hand panels , respectively .",
    "the slope of the imf in the high - mass regime ( @xmath6 ) appears to be shallow for massive dense clusters .",
    "the maximum stellar mass is also larger for more massive clusters ( lower right - hand panel ) .",
    "this @xmath7-@xmath8 relation is consistent with results from analytic approaches ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "it may imply the deterministic origin of the stellar mass .",
    "the galactic variations of the imf and the cluster properties were also investigated to simply test the environmental influences on the star formation processes .",
    "the massive dense clusters tend to be formed in the inner galaxy , while the formation of less massive sparse clusters seem to be dominant in the outer galaxy .",
    "we tentatively suggest that the star formation is likely to be controlled by local environmental conditions rather than a universal process .     with respect to the surface density of the clusters ( upper right ) and the cluster mass ( lower left ) , and a dependency of maximum stellar masses on the mass of host clusters ( lower right ) .",
