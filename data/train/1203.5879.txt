    "<S> using a generalized genetic algorithm , we propose four new sp@xmath0 carbon allotropes with 5 - 6 - 7 ( 5 - 6 - 7-type z - aca and z - cacb ) or 4 - 6 - 8 ( 4 - 6 - 8-type z4-a@xmath1b@xmath2 and a4-a@xmath3b@xmath3 ) carbon rings . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the four new carbon allotropes show amazing stability in comparison with the carbon phases proposed recently . </S>",
    "<S> both 5 - 6 - 7-type zaca and z - cacb are direct - band - gap semiconductors with band gaps of 2.261 ev and 4.196 ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , the 4 - 6 - 8-type z4-a@xmath1b@xmath2 and a4-a@xmath3b@xmath3 are indirect - band - gap semiconductors with band gaps of 3.105 ev and 3.271 ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their mechanical properties reveal that all the four carbon allotropes proposed in present work are superhard materials comparable to diamond . +    carbon is considered as the most active element in the periodic table due to its broad sp , sp@xmath4 and sp@xmath5 hybridizing ability . besides the four best - known carbon allotropes , graphite , cubic diamond ( c - diamond ) , hexagonal diamond ( h - diamond ) and amorphous carbon , </S>",
    "<S> an unknown superhard phase of carbon has been reported in experiment @xcite along with the structural phase transition in cold compressing graphite . </S>",
    "<S> several structures have been proposed theoretically as the candidate for this superhard phase , such as the monoclinic m - carbon@xcite , cubic body center c4 carbon ( bct - c4 ) @xcite and the orthorhombic w - carbon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the monoclinic one , namely m - carbon , has been preliminarily identified by a following experimental process of compressing graphite@xcite , bct - c4 and orthorhombic w - carbon can also fit the experimental xrd - data to some extent . </S>",
    "<S> these discoveries attract great interest in theoretical predication @xcite and experimental research @xcite on such superhard carbon allotropes . very recently </S>",
    "<S> , another new carbon allotrope , named as z - carbon , was proposed and investigated at almost the same time by three independent research groups @xcite ( this structure was also named as oc16ii in reference [ 8 ] and cco - c8 in reference [ 10 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> z - carbon is more stable ( its cohesive energy is about 129 mev per atom above diamond ) and harder than bct - c4 , m - carbon and w - carbon . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , its transition pressure is around 10 gpa which is lower than those of bct - c4 , m - carbon and w - carbon . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is believed that cold compressing graphite prefers forming z - carbon . </S>",
    "<S> although none of them can solely fit the experimental results satisfactorily , these theoretically proposed intermediate phases are significant in understanding the experimental process of cold compressing graphite and the cold compressing carbon nanotubes @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> all of them can be divided into two groups : 5 - 6 - 7-type ( m - carbon @xcite and w - carbon @xcite containing 5- , 6- , 7-carbon rings ) and 4 - 6 - 8-type ( bct - c4 @xcite and z - carbon @xcite containing 4- , 6- , 8-carbon rings ) . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that , from the point of view of structure , they all can be constructed through mutating h - diamonds or combing the segments of h - diamond and c - diamond . </S>",
    "<S> h - diamond and c - diamond are the most favorable sp@xmath0 carbon allotropes in nature that could be used as excellent parents for finding new carbon allotropes through hybridizing their stable segments . for example , bct - c4 and z - carbon can be looked upon as the hybridization of h - diamond and mutated h - diamond . </S>",
    "<S> m - carbon and w - carbon can be taken as the hybridization of distorted h - diamond and c - diamond segments . </S>",
    "<S> the 4h @xcite , 6h @xcite and 12r @xcite carbon allotropes can be regarded as the superlattice of c - diamond ( along [ 111 ] direction ) and h - diamond ( along 001 direction ) . by hybridizing c - diamond and h - diamond in different manners </S>",

    "<S> the genetic algorithm is widely used in searching for zero - dimensional ( 0d ) element clusters such as the carbon fullerenes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is an effective method in prediction three - dimensional ( 3d ) superhard carbon phases @xcite . in this paper , using a generalized ga , we choose h - diamond and c - diamond as parents to hybridize new carbon allotropes . </S>",

    "<S> the results indicate that all above carbon allotropes are superhard intermediate phases between graphite and diamond due to their considerable bulk modulus and hardness . </S>",
