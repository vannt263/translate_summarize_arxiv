    "one of the most puzzling observations in high energy astrophysics in the last decade or so is that of the over - luminous type  ia supernova .",
    "more than a dozen such supernovae have been observed since 2006 ( e.g. @xcite ) , whose significantly high luminosities can only be justified by invoking very massive progenitors , of mass @xmath2 where @xmath3 is solar mass .",
    "however , the chandrasekhar - limit prohibits the existence of such a massive progenitor white dwarf . proposed models explaining these highly super - chandrasekhar progenitors include rapidly ( and differentially ) rotating white dwarfs ( @xcite ) and binary evolution of accreting differentially rotating white dwarfs ( @xcite ) .",
    "another set of proposals which has recently brought the issue of super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs into the limelight relates to highly magnetised white dwarfs . in a series of papers ,",
    "the main message of this work has been that the enormous power of a magnetic field  irrespective of its nature of origin : quantum ( due to constant super - strong field : @xcite ) , classical and/or general relativistic ( due to a varying strong field exerting magnetic pressure and tension : @xcite )  is capable of revealing significantly super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs .",
    "remarkably , unlike other proposals , this work also adequately predicts the required mass - range @xmath4 of the progenitors in order to explain the set of over - luminous type  ia supernovae .",
    "the impact of high magnetic fields not only lies in increasing the limiting mass of white dwarfs but it is also expected to change other properties including luminosity , temperature , cooling rate etc .",
    "indeed , observations ( @xcite ) argue for the suppression of cooling in white dwarfs due to strong magnetic fields .",
    "this is in particular due to suppression of convection over the entire surface of magnetised white dwarfs , which in turn hinders their cooling evolution .",
    "therefore , highly magnetised white dwarfs may have lower surface temperature , and hence , luminosity .",
    "nevertheless , poloidally dominated magnetised white dwarfs are shown to be smaller in size ( @xcite ) , which can account for their lower luminosity .    although magnetised white dwarfs were attempted to explore earlier ( e.g. @xcite ) , no author concentrated on the effects of magnetic fields on the internal properties of white dwarfs , e.g. thermal conduction , cooling rate etc . as well as luminosity , even though sometimes the chosen field was well above the critical field , @xmath5 g for landau effects to arise ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the same is true for the exploration of magnetised white dwarfs by the mukhopadhyay - group , mentioned above .",
    "such an investigation has been more important for the magnetised white dwarfs proposed by the mukhopadhyay group , because the underlying central fields could be stronger , sometimes @xmath6 g. nevertheless , super - chandrasekhar , magnetised white dwarfs were also explored with relatively weaker central fields , e.g. @xmath7 g , which do not reveal any quantum mechanical effects , but the underlying magnetic pressure gradient , determined by the field geometries and profiles , is responsible for making the mass super - chandrasekhar ( @xcite ) .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the cooling of magnetised white dwarfs and calculate the corresponding luminosities .",
    "while the cooling of white dwarfs is not a completely resolved issue , it has been investigated since 1950s , e.g. , when @xcite attempted to understand the source of energy of white dwarfs and to estimate the ages of observed white dwarfs .",
    "subsequently , @xcite also explored the cooling of white dwarfs and found them to be radiating at the expense of their thermal energy .",
    "they also showed , by including the coulomb contribution to the thermal energy , that the lifetimes of white dwarfs are twice as large as estimated earlier .",
    "the evolution and cooling of low mass white dwarfs , beginning as a bright central star to the stage of crystallization after about 10 billion years , were also addressed by @xcite who argued that the similarity of a modern cooling curve then to the one predicted by @xcite is the consequence of a series of accidents .",
    "furthermore , @xcite reviewed the physics of cool white dwarfs , in particular their impact in order to extract valuable information about the early history of our galaxy .",
    "the above works either did not consider the effects of magnetic field or the fields embedding the star were assumed to be too weak to have any practical effects . on the other hand , the field of magnetised white dwarfs considered by our group ( and some others ) , as mentioned above , is high enough compared to that of all previous works which addressed the cooling of white dwarfs .",
    "hence , here we plan to explore the cooling and luminosity of magnetised white dwarfs proposed by us earlier .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we recapitulate how the density and temperature profiles at the interface can be obtained for non - magnetised white dwarfs , in addition to computing their cooling timescales . in  3 , we include the contribution of the magnetic field to the pressure and density of white dwarfs and compute the resultant density and temperature profiles for different luminosities and magnetic field strengths .",
    "subsequently , in  4 , we consider white dwarfs having either fixed interface radius or fixed interface temperature and evaluate their luminosities for increasing field strength . in  5 , we compute the cooling rates of magnetised white dwarfs for the cases discussed in  4 .",
    "next , we discuss the implications of our results for non - magnetised and magnetised white dwarfs in  6 .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary in  7 .",
    "in this section , we recapitulate how the luminosity - temperature relation and the temperature profile can be obtained using the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and photon diffusion for a non - magnetised non - relativistic white dwarf having a nondegenerate ideal gas envelope .",
    "once we know the luminosity and the specific heat in terms of temperature , we can find the cooling rate of the white dwarf .",
    "we use the same notation as used by @xcite .",
    "the electrons in the interior of a white dwarf are completely degenerate and have a large mean free path .",
    "this results in a high thermal conductivity and a uniform temperature in the inner regions ( core ) of the white dwarf .",
    "nondegenerate surface layers , which form the envelope and are in `` radiative equilibrium '' with each other and cover the isothermal interior of the white dwarf . by radiative equilibrium , we mean that the matter is in thermodynamic equilibrium locally and energy flux is carried outward by photon diffusion .    using the equations for photon diffusion and hydrostatic equilibrium , we obtain , @xmath8 in the above equation , @xmath9 is the pressure , @xmath10 is the temperature , @xmath11 is the radiation constant , @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath13 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath14 is the mass enclosed within radius @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the opacity of the stellar material and @xmath17 is the luminosity .",
    "the opacity can be approximated by kramer s formula @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the density of the stellar material , mass fractions of hydrogen and heavy elements ( elements other than hydrogen and helium ) in the stellar interior , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the opacity is due to the bound - free and free - free transitions of electrons ( @xcite ) .",
    "surface layers are expected to be much thinner as compared to the radius of the white dwarf and therefore , @xmath24 where , @xmath25 is the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "henceforth , the solar luminosity will be denoted as @xmath26 and the terms `` surface layers '' and `` envelope '' will be used interchangeably . in eqn .",
    "( 1 ) , we substitute @xmath21 using the equation of state ( eos ) of nondegenerate matter ( ideal gas ) and integrate with the boundary condition @xmath27 at @xmath28 to obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath31 is the average mass of particles in units of @xmath30 and @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the above relation between @xmath21 and @xmath10 is valid only in the surface layers and breaks down for the degenerate core of the white dwarf . at the interface between the degenerate core and the nondegenerate envelope ,",
    "the variation of density with temperature can be obtained , by equating the electron pressure on both sides , as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mean molecular weight per electron in units of @xmath30 . for a typical white dwarf , @xmath35 , the mass fraction of helium @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "using @xmath39 , @xmath40 and combining eqns . @xmath41 and @xmath42 ,",
    "the luminosity at the interface can be written in terms of temperature as @xmath43 hence , the interface temperature of a white dwarf can be determined if @xmath17 , @xmath25 and the composition are known .",
    "for observed white dwarfs , @xmath44 which corresponds to @xmath45 k and @xmath46 . substituting the expression for @xmath21 in the photon diffusion equation and integrating across the envelope ,",
    "we obtain @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the temperature at the surface , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the radii of the interface and the surface , respectively .",
    ", when @xmath51 km and @xmath52 k. ]    , when @xmath51 km and @xmath52 k. ]    we consider white dwarfs with @xmath53 . using the chandrasekhar s relation for white dwarfs , this corresponds to radius , @xmath51 km ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider this set of mass and radius throughout the paper .",
    "however , the results presented here practically do not change for other values of @xmath50 ( e.g. , in the range @xmath54 km ) and @xmath25 , unless @xmath55 is as high as @xmath56 k which we do not observe .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the variations of density and radius , respectively , with temperature in the non - degenerate envelope .",
    "figure 1 shows that the density at a given temperature , and hence radius , is suppressed with increasing luminosity . from eqn .",
    "( 6 ) , it can be seen that the @xmath57 relation is independent of luminosity .",
    "hence , we obtain the relation to be of straight lines with the same slope for different values of luminosity , as shown in fig . 2 for @xmath58 .",
    "as @xmath59 is different for different luminosities , the corresponding @xmath57 lines originate from different temperatures at the interface .    with the increase of @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath59 increases whereas @xmath49 decreases . for @xmath60",
    "k and @xmath61 k , @xmath62 corresponding to @xmath63 k , we have @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the central density of the white dwarf .",
    "table 1 shows the variations of @xmath59 , @xmath66 and @xmath49 as @xmath17 changes for a given value of @xmath48 and @xmath50 .",
    "we see that as @xmath17 increases , @xmath59 increases whereas @xmath49 decreases .    table 1 : @xmath59 , @xmath66 and @xmath49 for different @xmath17 , when @xmath67 k and @xmath68 km    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as discussed in  4.3 , the @xmath69 and @xmath70 profiles are sensitive to @xmath48 only at relatively low values of @xmath71 .",
    "hence , for larger values of @xmath71 , we do not have any considerable change in the values of @xmath59 and @xmath49 ( as obtained for @xmath67 k ) , by changing @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we do not calculate the cooling rates for this case as the change in @xmath59 is observable only for smaller values of @xmath71 , which is the same as the non - magnetic result .",
    "in this section , we discuss our results described in the previous sections and their physical significance .      from table 1",
    ", we see that as @xmath17 increases in the envelope , @xmath59 and @xmath66 both increase whereas @xmath49 decreases . using eqns .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we obtain @xmath72 hence , a white dwarf having a larger @xmath59 has more stored thermal energy , which it can radiate thus giving rise to a larger @xmath17 .",
    "also , a larger @xmath59 corresponds to a larger @xmath66 . for a fixed @xmath48 and @xmath50",
    ", @xmath49 should decrease as @xmath59 increases .",
    "this is because the outer regions of the white dwarf are cooler as compared to the inner ones .",
    "we also find that @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 and the cooling rate @xmath75 increase with the increase in luminosity of the white dwarf . from eqns .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 15 ) , @xmath76 note that @xmath17 corresponds to the energy flux which is transported across a spherical surface and hence a larger luminosity means a larger flux ( for a given radius ) i.e. a larger @xmath77 . from eqn . (",
    "34 ) it is clear that hotter or more luminous white dwarfs cool faster as @xmath78 is larger .",
    "therefore , the cooling rate should be more for a white dwarf having larger luminosity .      in  4.1 ,",
    "we have found out how much the luminosity has to increase or decrease for a magnetised white dwarf for it to have the same interface radius as a non - magnetised white dwarf .",
    "then in  5.1 , we have also computed the cooling rates for the corresponding cases and used the values of @xmath17 as obtained in  4.1 to obtain the surface temperatures . here",
    "we discuss our results .      for a fixed @xmath49 and constant @xmath71 ,",
    "we have computed @xmath79 , @xmath66 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath82 , corresponding to @xmath83 for the non - magnetic case .",
    "we have found that as @xmath71 increases , @xmath17 , @xmath59 and @xmath66 all have to increase for @xmath49 to be fixed , which can be seen from table 8 . from eqn .",
    "( 26 ) , we have @xmath84    from eqn . ( 35 ) , we see that if @xmath71 increases , then @xmath85 decreases for a given @xmath10 and @xmath17 . as the initial conditions are the same , we obtain a smaller value of @xmath21 for a given @xmath10 , if @xmath71 is larger .",
    "hence , the presence of magnetic field suppresses the matter density at a given temperature . as a result , @xmath59 , which is obtained by the intersection of the @xmath86 curve with eqn .",
    "( 4 ) , increases .",
    "this is because the density of matter at which it becomes degenerate is reached only at a higher temperature .",
    "similarly , an increase of @xmath17 also leads to the increase of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the increase of @xmath71 leads to the increase of @xmath59 and @xmath17 .",
    "also , @xmath66 increases as @xmath87 by eqn .",
    "we find that the temperature falls with radial distance from the centre of the white dwarf .",
    "@xmath88 , and the rate of cooling of the white dwarf , i.e. , @xmath89 , both increase with @xmath71 .",
    "as @xmath59 increases with increasing @xmath71 and @xmath17 and @xmath49 remain fixed , an increase in @xmath88 is expected .",
    "we have @xmath17 to be of the form @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constants which depend on the magnetic field strength , as given in table 12 . with the increase of b ,",
    "@xmath91 decreases and @xmath92 increases .",
    "hence , we have @xmath93 which gives @xmath94 when @xmath71 increases , @xmath95 decreases but @xmath96 decreases more such that their ratio decreases .",
    "this is because @xmath78 increases more in comparison to @xmath10 with increasing @xmath71 , as can be seen from table 12 .",
    "therefore , the cooling rate increases with the increase of @xmath71 .      in  4.1.2 and  5.2.2",
    ", we have fixed @xmath49 for a varying magnetic field and calculated @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath66 and @xmath81 .",
    "we have used @xmath82 , i.e. the value of interface radius corresponding to @xmath97 and @xmath98 . from table 9",
    ", we have seen that as @xmath71 increases , @xmath17 , @xmath59 and @xmath66 all decrease for @xmath49 to be fixed .",
    "this is the opposite of what is observed for a constant magnetic field .    from eqn .",
    "( 30 ) we have , @xmath99 it can be seen that eqn .",
    "( 38 ) is quite similar to eqn .",
    "( 35 ) , with the denominator having an additional term in eqn .",
    "( 38 ) . for the @xmath71 configuration that we have considered",
    ", the strength of the field increases with density .",
    "therefore , @xmath100 is positive and we obtain a smaller value of @xmath85 for a given field strength for the varying magnetic field case as compared to the one with a constant magnetic field .",
    "therefore , a varying magnetic field suppresses the matter density at a given temperature more than a constant field and we obtain a larger value of @xmath59 , for a similar reason as the constant field case .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath49 also decreases such that @xmath101 decreases . from eqn .",
    "( 27 ) , @xmath102 in this case , the decrease in @xmath21 with the increase in @xmath71 is large enough to counteract an increase in @xmath103 and @xmath104 decreases with the increase in @xmath71 for sufficiently small @xmath17 .",
    "this does not happen in the constant field case as the reduction of @xmath21 is not large enough and @xmath104 near the interface increases with increasing @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , in this case we have a smaller @xmath59 and a smaller @xmath17 for larger field strengths , for @xmath49 to be constant .",
    "the value of @xmath66 also decreases with field as @xmath87 .",
    "we find that @xmath88 and @xmath89 both decrease with @xmath71 .",
    "as @xmath59 decreases with the increase in @xmath71 and @xmath49 remains fixed , a decrease in @xmath88 is expected . as for the previous case",
    ", @xmath17 is of the form @xmath90 as given in table 13 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath105 when @xmath71 increases , @xmath95 and @xmath96 both decrease .",
    "however , the decrease in @xmath95 is more such that @xmath106 increases . with increasing @xmath71 , @xmath78 and @xmath92 do not change considerably whereas @xmath91 decreases by orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the cooling rate decreases with the increase in @xmath71 .",
    "in  4.2 , we have computed the change of @xmath17 of a magnetised white dwarf for it to have the same @xmath107 as a non - magnetised white dwarf .",
    "then in  5.3 , we have found the cooling rates for the corresponding cases and used the values of @xmath17 as obtained in  4.2 to obtain @xmath48 .",
    "here we discuss our results .      for a fixed @xmath59 and constant magnetic field ,",
    "we have computed @xmath79 , @xmath49 , @xmath66 and @xmath80 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath108 , which is the interface temperature corresponding to @xmath83 for the non - magnetic case .",

    ". as the initial conditions for the @xmath86 profile are the same , @xmath85 has to be larger near the interface for the magnetic case , which is achieved by the reduction of @xmath17 .",

    "this is achieved as the decrease in @xmath17 is sufficiently small in comparison to the increase in @xmath103 such that @xmath112 near the interface increases and we obtain a larger value for @xmath49 .",
    "an increase in @xmath88 is expected as @xmath59 is fixed whereas @xmath49 increases .",
    "we find that the cooling rate @xmath89 decreases with the increase of the magnetic field strength . as in  6.2 ,",
    "@xmath17 can be written as @xmath90 as given in table 14 and the expression for the cooling timescale is given by eqn .",
    "( 37 ) . unlike the fixed @xmath49 and constant field case , here",
    "the decrease in @xmath96 is not as much as that for @xmath113 which makes @xmath106 larger for larger @xmath71 .",
    "as mentioned earlier in  6.2 , @xmath91 changes by orders of magnitude whereas @xmath78 and @xmath92 do not change considerably .      in  4.2.2 and  5.3.2 , we have fixed @xmath59 for a varying magnetic field and calculated @xmath79 , @xmath49 , @xmath66 and @xmath80 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath114 k , which is the interface temperature corresponding to @xmath83 for the non - magnetic case and found that as @xmath71 increases , both @xmath17 and @xmath49 decrease , whereas @xmath66 remains constant , as can be seen from table 11 .",
    "we recall eqns .",
    "( 38 ) and ( 39 ) which are applicable here as well .",
    "as @xmath87 for a nondegenerate envelope , @xmath66 has to be fixed as @xmath59 is fixed .",

    "as the initial conditions for the @xmath86 profile are same , we should have larger @xmath85 near the interface for the magnetic case , which happens because of a reduction in @xmath17 . therefore",
    ", for @xmath59 to be fixed with increasing field , @xmath17 has to decrease .",
    "now , as the initial conditions for solving eqn .",
    "( 39 ) are the same as those for the non - magnetic case and @xmath104 near the surface is larger for larger magnetic fields ( from fig .",
    "12 ) , @xmath104 should be smaller near the interface for obtaining a smaller value of @xmath49 for a given @xmath59 in this case .",
    "we find that with increasing @xmath71 , the luminosity for the varying field is sufficiently small in addition to @xmath21 being small , which counteracts the increase in @xmath103 thus making @xmath104 near the interface smaller .",

    "@xmath101 decreases as @xmath59 is fixed whereas @xmath49 decreases .",

    "we have , @xmath115 as given in table 15 and the expression for the cooling timescale is given by eqn .",
    "( 37 ) . as for the constant field and fixed @xmath59 case , here",
    "the decrease in @xmath113 is larger as compared to the decrease in @xmath96 , which makes @xmath106 larger for larger @xmath71 .      for the solar neighbourhood of radius @xmath116 kpc and disk thickness @xmath117 kpc ,",
    "the expected number of visible white dwarfs with number density @xmath118 pc@xmath119 ( @xcite ) is @xmath120 as the average mass of observed white dwarfs is @xmath121 , the mass of these white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood is @xmath122 now , @xmath123 of the main sequence stars , with density in the solar neighbourhood @xmath124 , ultimately turn out to be white dwarfs .",
    "hence the upper limit of total mass due to white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood is given by @xmath125 from eqns .",
    "( 44 ) and ( 45 ) , we have an approximate estimate of mass corresponding to non - visible white dwarfs @xmath126 interestingly , this is the same order as the missing mass , of density @xmath127 , in the solar neighbourhood , which is @xmath128 .",
    "now , observed white dwarfs have luminosities in the range @xmath129 . in  4 ,",
    "we have shown that the luminosity of a magnetised white dwarf has to decrease for either @xmath49 or @xmath59 to be the same as a non - magnetised white dwarf , except for the case when there is a uniform magnetic field inside the white dwarf and @xmath49 is fixed .",
    "in other words , for a magnetised white dwarf to have similar interface parameters as a non - magnetised one , its luminosity needs to be much smaller  the luminosity can be as small as @xmath130 for very high magnetic fields .",
    "indeed the surface temperatures of white dwarfs with different @xmath71 are found / observed neither to be coherently changing with @xmath71 nor to be differing significantly for different @xmath71 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such low luminosity white dwarfs are naturally not visible . above estimate",
    "argues that such highly magnetised white dwarfs may be a significant component of @xmath131 . like neutron stars ,",
    "they are supposed to be in the very bottom left of the h - r diagram and hardly visible .",
    "we have investigated the effects of magnetic field in the luminosity and cooling of white dwarfs . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first systematic attempt towards this mission .",
    "this is very useful to account for observability of recently proposed highly magnetised white dwarfs , in particular the ones having central field @xmath132 g. however , we have deferred our investigation for white dwarfs with fields @xmath133 g for a future work , which will affect the eos significantly and , subsequently , might change the thermal conduction and , hence , observable properties more severely .",
    "we have computed the variation of luminosity of highly magnetised white dwarfs with magnetic field strength ( both radially constant and varying cases ) and evaluated the corresponding cooling timescales for white dwarfs having fixed interface radius or temperature . except for the fixed interface radius with constant magnetic field cases",
    ", we have seen that the luminosity is suppressed with the increase in field strength , in addition to a reduction of cooling rates ( marginally ) .",
    "therefore , white dwarfs with higher magnetic fields have lower luminosities and slower cooling , for the interface radius or temperature to be fixed .    for a similar gravitational energy ( similar mass and radius ) , an increasing magnetic energy",
    "necessarily requires decreasing thermal energy for white dwarfs to be in equilibrium , which results in a decreasing luminosity .",
    "we have found that the luminosity could be as low as @xmath134 for a white dwarf with the central field @xmath7 g and the surface field @xmath135 g , for a fixed interface temperature . as a result , such white dwarfs appear to be invisible with respect to current astronomical techniques . with decreasing the surface field , while the luminosity tends to be in the observable limit , it is still @xmath136 for the surface field @xmath137 g. for a fixed interface radius , however , luminosity could be much lower , @xmath138 , for central and surface fields respectively @xmath139 g and @xmath140 g. by decreasing surface field to @xmath137 g , it is still @xmath134 , well below the observational limit . therefore , such white dwarfs , while expected to be present in the universe , are virtually invisible to us , perhaps lying in the lower left corner in the h - r diagram .",
