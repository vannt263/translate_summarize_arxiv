    "since the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , the ubiquity of highly luminous young star clusters in starburst environments , sometimes referred to as `` super star clusters '' ( sscs ) , has been firmly established .",
    "some of the best - known cases include merger galaxies such as the `` antennae '' @xcite and ngc  3256 @xcite , but sscs have also been found in galaxies that do _ not _ show any obvious indications of having been involved in recent merger events .",
    "examples of isolated starburst dwarfs with sscs are ngc  1569 and ngc  1705 @xcite .",
    "the large magellanic cloud also contains a number of `` blue populous '' or `` young massive '' clusters ( ymcs ) @xcite , many of which have ages characteristic of milky way _ open _",
    "clusters , i.e.  a few times @xmath9 years or younger , but are an order of magnitude more massive than any young cluster that is known in our galaxy today .",
    "such clusters are also present in some spiral galaxies , and there appears to be a fairly tight relation between the star formation rates ( sfrs ) of galaxies and the number of ymcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lr2000 ) .",
    "the current terminology is confusing and reflects , to a large extent , a lack of understanding of how different types of clusters are related .",
    "the terms `` populous '' , `` massive '' and `` super '' clusters were introduced as a reference to star clusters that apparently have no counterpart in our galaxy , but do they actually constitute a separate class of objects , fundamentally different from low - mass `` open '' clusters ?",
    "do they require special conditions to form ?",
    "there is not really any _ a priori _ reason to assume that the open cluster system in the milky way is representative for other galaxies or even other spirals , and by the same token , the _ presence _ of ymcs in e.g.   the lmc may be no more unusual than their _ absence _ in our galaxy .",
    "it may be more appropriate to view the cluster system of our galaxy as part of a continuum that ranges from very cluster - poor galaxies with low sfrs such as ic  1613 @xcite , over our galaxy , to the lmc and finally to starburst environments .",
    "simple statistics may play a role in determining the luminosity of the brightest cluster in a galaxy , since random sampling of a power - law luminosity function ( lf ) will give brighter clusters in galaxies with richer cluster systems @xcite .",
    "rich cluster systems , in turn , would generally be expected in galaxies with high levels of star formation .",
    "in addition to statistical effects there may be a physical upper limit to the mass of star clusters that can form in a galaxy , determined by factors such as the gas density and -pressure of the interstellar medium which are also expected to correlate with the overall star formation rate @xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear to what extent sampling statistics or physics dominate the maximum observed cluster luminosities and -masses , and under what conditions one or the other might prevail .    in reality , very little is known about how the lf of young cluster populations depends on environment .",
    "@xcite found that the lf of milky way open clusters is well described as a power - law of the form @xmath1 with @xmath10 for @xmath11 , but may steepen somewhere in the range @xmath12 .",
    "studies of young cluster populations in other galaxies generally find somewhat steeper slopes , @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xcite suggested a bend at @xmath14 for young clusters in the antennae with @xmath15 for brighter clusters and @xmath16 for fainter clusters .",
    "unfortunately , there is little overlap between observations of open clusters in the milky way , which cover a very limited section of our galaxy and include few clusters _ brighter _ than @xmath17 , and studies of young clusters in external galaxies where the identification of clusters _ fainter _ than @xmath18 is difficult because of the risk of confusion with individual , luminous stars .",
    "even with hst , unambiguous identification of star clusters in crowded environments is problematic at distances greater than 1015 mpc .",
    "considering the diversity of properties encountered among young cluster populations even in normal spirals , hst images of nearby spirals may provide some insight into correlations between properties of the cluster systems and host galaxy parameters .",
    "the hst archive contains a number of wfpc2 datasets covering nearby spiral galaxies , including many of those studied by lr2000 .",
    "at the typical distances of these galaxies ( @xmath19 mpc ) , one wf pixel corresponds to a linear scale of 23 pc , comparable to the typical half - light radius of a star cluster .",
    "this makes it possible to identify star clusters based on their angular extent and thereby greatly reduce the risk of contamination by individual stars . in this paper",
    "i examine hst archive images of 6 selected galaxies from lr2000 , some of which possess rich populations of ymcs while others have more modest , presumably more milky way - like cluster populations . as with any survey based on archive data , the choices of exposure times , filters and exact pointing are limited by what happens to be available .",
    "however , even with exposures in only one band one can perform interesting comparisons of the cluster populations in different galaxies . as a bonus",
    ", the wfpc2 data can be used for a check of the ground - based cluster identifications .",
    "the detailed structure of individual clusters will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the data were downloaded from the hst archive at the canadian astronomy data centre ( cadc ) with standard `` on - the - fly '' pipeline processing .",
    "only datasets including exposures longer than about 5 min in a @xmath20-band equivalent ( f547 m , f555w or f606w ) were considered .",
    "when several exposures in a band were available they were combined using the crrej task in the stsdas package in iraf to eliminate cosmic ray hits .",
    "the wfpc2 datasets used in this paper are listed in table  [ tab : datasets ] and the pointings are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pointings ] . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pointings ] , the pointings cover different parts of the respective galaxies relative to the center , spiral arms etc , and a more uniform coverage would certainly have been important in a dedicated survey .",
    "nevertheless , the archive data used here should still provide a basis for a first rough intercomparison of star clusters in the different galaxies . in some cases",
    "the pc chip is centered on the galaxy nucleus but the main focus in this paper is on clusters in the disks , and the nuclear regions , where crowding and dust extinction may pose more serious problems , have generally been avoided .",
    "objects were detected using the daofind task in daophot @xcite running within iraf , using a 3@xmath21 detection threshold .",
    "when exposures in more than one band were available , daofind was run independently on each exposure and the resulting object lists were matched to reduce the number of spurious detections .",
    "aperture photometry was then done with the apphot task in daophot , using aperture radii of 3 and 5 pixels .",
    "when only one band was available , calibration of the photometry to standard @xmath20 magnitudes was provided by the zero - points in the _ _",
    "wfpc2 handbook__. otherwise the transformations in @xcite were used .",
    "aperture corrections were determined by convolving a synthetic point spread function ( psf ) generated by tinytim  @xcite with various models for the cluster profiles and measuring the flux within apertures of various sizes .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : apc ] for aperture radii of 3 and 20 pixels , relative to a reference aperture of 5 pixels @xcite .",
    "in addition to point sources ( the pure tinytim   psf ) , the aperture corrections were determined for king and moffat models @xcite with fwhm of 0.5 and 1.0 pixels , covering the typical range of intrinsic cluster sizes expected in the galaxies .",
    "the calibration by @xcite includes an implicit correction of 0.1 mag from their @xmath22 reference aperture to infinity , which agrees fairly well with the aperture correction from @xmath23 to @xmath24 pixels for point sources in table  [ tab : apc ] .",
    "however , magnitudes measured in the @xmath23 pixels aperture will be underestimated by an additional @xmath25 mag for the most extended objects . for an aperture radius of 3 pixels",
    ", the magnitudes of objects with fwhm=0.5 and 1.0 pixels will be too faint by about 0.12 mag and 0.35 mag , respectively ( assuming king @xmath26 profiles ) , if the @xmath27 mag aperture corrections for point sources are used .",
    "for accurate integrated photometry of the clusters , knowledge of their intrinsic light profiles would be needed , but for the present purpose it was decided to simply use an aperture correction of @xmath28 mag for photometry in the @xmath29 pixels aperture . finally , note that the size - dependent corrections for _ colors _ are generally negligible .",
    "sizes were measured for all objects using the ishape  code .",
    "the code is described in detail in @xcite , and extensive tests of its performance have been carried out in that paper and elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "briefly , intrinsic object sizes are measured by adopting an analytic model of the source and convolving the model with the psf , adjusting the shape parameters ( fwhm , orientation , ellipticity ) until the best match to the observed image is obtained . for the analytic model a king @xmath26 profile",
    "was used , while the psf was modeled with tinytim . when exposures of adequate depth were available in several bands ,",
    "the sizes were obtained as an average of measurements in each band .",
    "distances to the galaxies were taken from the references in @xcite , except for ngc  6946 where a distance modulus of 28.9 was assumed @xcite .",
    "corrections for galactic foreground extinction were applied according to @xcite as provided by the _",
    "nasa / ipac extragalactic database _ ( ned ) . the adopted distance moduli and reddenings are listed in table  [ tab : datasets ] . even though the galaxies studied here",
    "are oriented nearly face - on so that the effect of internal extinction is minimized , significant extinction may still be present in some areas , especially within dusty regions in spiral arms where @xmath30 can exceed 1 mag ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in sect",
    "[ sec : reddening ] , @xmath31 data are used to obtain reddening estimates for clusters in one of the fields , suggesting modest reddenings for most of those clusters ( @xmath32 mag ) . in the other fields there is no information available about the reddenings of individual clusters , so reddening within the galaxies has generally been ignored .",
    "some considerations concerning the effect of variable extinction on the observed luminosity functions are given in sect  [ sec : masses ] .",
    "because of the complete @xmath33 coverage the data from hst program 8715 ( field ngc  69463 ) are very suitable for a comparison with the ground - based data used in lr2000 .",
    "wfpc2 images of all cluster candidates in this field identified from the ground are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl6946f5 ] with each panel covering a @xmath34 pixels ( @xmath35 ) section around each candidate .",
    "an extremely luminous cluster contained within the pc chip is discussed elsewhere @xcite and has been omitted here .",
    "ground - based and wfpc2 @xmath33 photometry and sizes are listed in table  [ tab : f5 ] .",
    "most of the objects in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl6946f5 ] are clearly extended and very likely clusters . with adequate s / n",
    ", objects with intrinsic fwhm down to 0.2 pixels can be resolved by ishape  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to about 0.8 pc at the assumed distance of ngc  6946 .",
    "only one object ( # 2350 ) is smaller than this limit , but this object is far too bright to be an individual star ( @xmath36 , from the wfpc2 data ) and is most likely a very compact cluster . for objects # 1490 , # 2210 and # 2745 the classification as star clusters is more dubious , because these are located in crowded areas where a blend of two or more stars might be mistaken by ishape  for a cluster .",
    "for this reason , these three objects have been omitted from table  [ tab : f5 ] .",
    "it therefore appears that about 3 of the 13 objects in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl6946f5 ] might be non - clusters , indicating a `` contamination '' fraction for the ground - based cluster identifications of @xmath37 .",
    "inspection of ground - selected cluster candidates on the full set of wfpc2 images in table  [ tab : datasets ] corroborates this estimate and a similar conclusion was reached for a ground - based survey of young clusters in m51 @xcite .",
    "the wfpc2 photometry in table  [ tab : f5 ] was done with an @xmath23 pixels aperture , correcting the @xmath20 magnitudes by @xmath38 mag to account for the extended nature of the objects .",
    "even after that correction , the ground - based @xmath20 magnitudes remain somewhat brighter than those measured on the wfpc2 images , with a mean difference of @xmath39 mag . for _ colors _ the systematic differences are very small , with @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the offset in @xmath20 magnitude is most likely due to the use of a much larger aperture ( @xmath43 ) for the ground - based measurements , including contributions from nearby stars and clusters which do not fall within the smaller aperture used for the wfpc2 photometry . to test",
    "if this can account for the difference between hst and ground - based photometry , @xmath20 magnitudes for the clusters were also measured in an @xmath44 pixels ( @xmath43 ) aperture on the hst images .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab : f5 ] as @xmath45 , except for object # 1371 which is too close to the edge of the wf4 chip .",
    "the measurements in this larger aperture do indeed agree very well with the ground - based ones , with a mean difference of only @xmath46 mag .",
    "concerning the sizes , it is clear that huge differences exist between the measurements on ground - based and wfpc2 images .",
    "again , this can be attributed to the presence of other objects near the cluster candidates , which tend to blur the ground - based images and make the clusters look bigger than they are .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in @xcite , where it was also shown that even relatively distant `` neighbors '' can affect the size estimates significantly .",
    "even relatively short wfpc2 exposures allow cluster candidates to be identified with reasonable confidence to much fainter limiting magnitudes than from the ground because of the better angular resolution and improved contrast .",
    "reliable size measurements require a s / n of 3050 @xcite , which is reached in about 10 min with the f555w filter for a @xmath47 object superimposed on a moderately bright sky background , such as that encountered within the disk of a spiral galaxy . with the same exposure time , the broader f606w filter permits size measurements for somewhat fainter objects .    fig .

    "all photometry was done in an @xmath29 pixels aperture . for objects brighter than @xmath48",
    ", there is a fairly clear separation between extended sources and compact , unresolved objects which fall near the @xmath49axis and have fwhm @xmath50 pixel . to reduce the risk of including contaminants in the cluster lists , relatively conservative size- and magnitude limits were chosen . for the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : v_sz ] , cluster candidates were selected as objects with @xmath51 and fwhm @xmath52 pixels .",
    "for the other fields the adopted magnitude cuts ranged between @xmath53 and @xmath47 , depending on the quality of the data . to ensure homogeneity in the selection of cluster candidates , no other selection criteria , such as color cuts , were applied since some datasets contained exposures in only one band .",
    "the magnitude cuts used for selection of the cluster samples are well above the level where completeness effects are important .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmpl ] , which shows completeness functions for each wfpc2 field .",
    "the completeness functions were determined by adding artificial sources to each of the wf chips at random positions ( but with minimum separations of 10 pixels ) and redoing the detection- and photometry procedures and counting how many of the artificial sources that were recovered .",
    "objects with magnitudes between @xmath54 and @xmath55 were added at 0.5 mag intervals , with 500 objects per chip at each magnitude step .",
    "the artificial objects were modeled as king profiles with an intrinsic fwhm of 0.5 pixels , convolved with the tinytim  point - spread function .",
    "note that the completeness is not a simple function of the exposure times ( see table  [ tab : datasets ] ) , but depends on factors such as the sky background in the individual fields , degree of crowding etc .",
    "the solid parts of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmpl ] represent the magnitude intervals used for luminosity function analysis in sec  [ sec : obslf ] . in all cases",
    "the completeness is formally better than 93% in the relevant magnitude intervals .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that these tests only give a rough indication of the actual cluster detection efficiency , since the clusters are not distributed at random within the frames but tend to clump together in ways that are not easily modeled .",
    "the main concern is contamination of the cluster lists by other objects , of which blends of stars in crowded regions is the most serious problem .",
    "this effect is expected to be more severe at fainter magnitudes , possibly causing the slopes of the luminosity functions to be overestimated , and is considered below ( sect .",
    "[ sec : obslf ] ) .",
    "another potential problem is that some clusters might be more compact than the adopted size limit and therefore would not be counted as clusters , but to first order this should not lead to any systematic errors in lf slopes because the linear sizes of star clusters are nearly independent of their masses / luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "background objects , especially early - type galaxies , might also resemble star clusters . to test how",
    "many such objects would typically be expected in the relevant magnitude range within the wfpc2 field , f606w exposures of two reference fields were downloaded and reduced in the same way as the galaxy data .",
    "one field was the _ hubble deep field _",
    "@xcite , of which 7 exposures with a total exposure time of 6300 s were used , making it much deeper than any of the galaxy datasets .",
    "the other field was a parallel wfpc2 exposure located 175  from ngc  628 ( program i d 9244 ) , exposed for @xmath56 s in f606w and thus of about the same depth as the galaxy datasets . in the hdf and ngc  628 reference fields ,",
    "a total of 10 and 13 objects brighter than @xmath47 and 5 and 6 objects brighter than @xmath53 were found , of which only about half met the size criterion used for cluster selection . in the presence of dust extinction in the cluster",
    "host galaxies , these numbers would be further reduced .",
    "the density of distant background galaxies may vary across the sky , but contamination by background galaxies is clearly not expected to pose any significant problem unless a rich galaxy cluster happens to be in the background .",
    "[ fig : bv_ub ] shows a ( , ) two - color diagram for cluster candidates in ngc  6946 with @xmath31 photometry ( table  [ tab : cl6946f5 ] ) , corrected for galactic foreground reddening . the solid curve superimposed on the plot represents the mean colors of lmc clusters @xcite while the dashed line is a 4 myr solar metallicity stellar isochrone from @xcite .",
    "there are a few objects with redder colors than expected , which could be highly reddened clusters or possibly background galaxies , but the majority of the cluster candidates have colors that are compatible with the lmc clusters .",
    "although the location of the bluest clusters in the ( , ) plane is not very different from that of individual early - type stars , the fact that most of the cluster candidates fall near the expected location provides a good sanity check on the identifications .",
    "the color distributions for cluster candidates in fields with photometry in more than one band are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : colfig ] .",
    "the information contained in a single color is limited , but slight differences between the fields do exist and are most likely due to different reddening and/or age distributions . in particular , the broader  color distribution in the ngc  5236 field may suggest larger variations and a higher mean reddening in this field compared to ngc  69463 .",
    "however , multi - color data are needed to resolve the age - reddening degeneracy .      for clusters with complete @xmath31 photometry , an estimate of the individual reddenings can be obtained using the `` @xmath57''-method ( * ? ? ? * hereafter vh68 ) , where the intrinsic color ( e.g. ) of the cluster is assumed to be a function of the reddening - free @xmath57-parameter .",

    ", corresponding to ages below @xmath68 myr , @xmath69 ( or any other color ) is no longer a simple function of @xmath57 and the @xmath57-method may underestimate @xmath60 by up to @xmath70 mag for the youngest clusters .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the shape of the `` loop '' in the colors of the youngest clusters is strongly metallicity - dependent . a similar effect exists for @xmath71 ( age @xmath72 160 myr ) , although the effect would here be to grossly overestimate the reddenings .",

    "the plots do show some clusters with apparently very large reddenings , but for most clusters the observed reddenings are compatible with the galactic foreground values and the internal absorption in ngc  6946 generally appears to be less than about 1 mag in @xmath60 .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached from inspection of figure  [ fig : bv_ub ] .",
    "for some clusters the derived reddenings are actually smaller than the foreground value , which might be partly due to the ambiguity in the reddening determinations for the youngest clusters .",
    "another uncertainty arises from stochastic color variations , especially in low - mass clusters where the integrated light is dominated by a few individual stars @xcite .",

    "this difference may very well reflect uncertainties in the area normalization of the cluster surface densities , and/or the exponent @xmath88 , dust extinction etc .",
    "also , the lr2000 survey excluded clusters with h@xmath88 emission and objects located in very crowded regions , introducing a bias against the very youngest and hence most luminous objects . to remove the offset by changing only the cluster densities would require the mean cluster densities within @xmath138 to be a factor of 3 lower than the estimates in table  [ tab : lffit ] .",
    "the only spiral where the spatial distribution of ( young ) star clusters has been discussed in some detail is m31 , where the clusters are strongly concentrated at intermediate distances from the center @xcite .",
    "if the same is the case in the galaxies studied here then one can suspect from fig .",
    "[ fig : pointings ] that the mean cluster densities are indeed somewhat lower than inferred from the wfpc2 pointings . alternatively , extrapolation of a power - law lf with @xmath139 from the observed @xmath97 $ ] would also remove the offset , although this would be incompatible with most of the fits in table  [ tab : lffit ] .",
    "a more complete survey of clusters is necessary in order to establish the relation between , luminosity functions and the cluster densities with greater certainty .",
    "as pointed out by bhe02 and @xcite , the two dwarfs ngc  1569 and ngc  1705 both contain a few highly luminous clusters that are much brighter than expected from the general size of their cluster populations .",
    "it is interesting to note that these two galaxies fit better into the `` pure ''   @xmath140 relation in panel ( c ) . the luminosity function of star clusters in these galaxies might be peculiar and perhaps biased towards high - mass clusters .",
    "although the observed behavior of @xmath140 as a function of @xmath5 and  is well accounted for by random sampling of a power - law lf in terms of the slope and , to a lesser extent , the normalization , some scatter remains in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_vm ] .",
    "part of this scatter may be due to uncertainties in the distances ( @xmath141 ) of the galaxies , but such uncertainties are partly compensated for by the fact that both the observed and predicted maximum cluster luminosities scale with distance : @xmath142 , while @xmath143 ( for @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , even an error of a factor of two in the distance of a galaxy only leads to a deviation of about 0.5 mag in the @xmath144 relation , substantially less than the observed scatter .",
    "however , for the @xmath145 relation there are no such mitigating circumstances to reduce the effect of distance errors since  itself is distance - independent .    to test how much scatter",
    "would be expected if the maximum cluster luminosity is the result of random sampling , a set of monte carlo simulations were carried out . in each simulation , clusters were picked at random from a population with a power - law luminosity distribution with @xmath7 until 2000 clusters had been counted in the interval @xmath146 .",
    "a histogram of the @xmath123 magnitudes of the _ brightest _ cluster encountered in each of 500 such simulations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lmaxmc ] .",
    "the mean and median of the distribution are @xmath147 and med(@xmath124 ) = @xmath148 , respectively , while direct integration of the lf ( as in eq .",
    "[ eq : norm ] ) yields @xmath149 for a cluster population of this size .",
    "the standard deviation is @xmath150 mag , similar to the observed scatter in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_vm ] .",
    "if the high - luminosity tail is truncated at @xmath151 , e.g.  by a physical upper limit to the mass spectrum , then the scatter would decrease to @xmath152 mag .",
    "thus , we find that not only the slopes but also the observed scatter in panels ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : sfr_vm ] are fully accounted for by random sampling of the lf , and that the scatter increases significantly if the maximum cluster luminosity is plotted as a function of  only .",
    "several lines of evidence therefore suggest that statistical effects related to sample size play an important role in determining the luminosities of the brightest clusters in galaxies",
    ".      physically , it would be more relevant to compare cluster _",
    "mass _ functions rather than lfs .",
    "however , useful estimates of cluster masses based on integrated photometry require fairly accurate knowledge of ages because mass - to - light ratios are very sensitive to age .",
    "for a sample of clusters with a range of ages , the shape of the luminosity function will generally be different from that of the underlying mass function @xcite .",
    "if the role played by sampling statistics is as important as suggested in section [ sec : compobs ] , it may be difficult to find galaxies that provide large enough samples of clusters to make detection of a physical upper limit to the lf possible .",
    "however , it is still possible that physical conditions play a role in shaping the _ mass _ distributions of cluster systems . for a continuous star formation history ,",
    "even relatively quiescent galaxies ought to form very massive clusters once in a while if only sampling effects were important .",
    "such massive clusters should be able to survive for long periods of time .",
    "the milky way does contain a number of rather massive `` open '' clusters that are several gyrs old @xcite and the 2-gyr old cluster ngc  1978 in the lmc @xcite is another example .      a simple illustration of how the luminosity function may differ from the mass function is provided in fig .  [ fig : lf_synt ] , which shows a simulated luminosity function for clusters with ages uniformly distributed between @xmath127 and @xmath153 years .",
    "the mass function was assumed to be a power - law with exponent @xmath154 for @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath20-band mass - to - light ratio was estimated as @xmath156 , obtained as a fit to model calculations by bc2001 .",
    "the slope of the composite luminosity function is clearly steeper than that of the underlying mass distribution , as indicated by the dashed line which is a fit to the interval @xmath157 and has a slope of @xmath158 . if the mass distribution were a single , untruncated power - law then the combined luminosity function would , of course , be a power - law with the same slope . the steeper slope of the lf in fig .",
    "[ fig : lf_synt ] is due to the truncation of the mass function at @xmath159 , but more subtle effects like a change in the slope of the mass function at a certain mass would have similar consequences .",
    "this type of simulations can also provide some insight into the effect of dust extinction on the observed lfs .",
    "two cases were considered : 1 ) random extinctions , varying between @xmath160 and @xmath161 mag ; 2 ) random extinctions , varying between @xmath160 and @xmath162 for @xmath163 , as above .",
    "the latter case was adopted as an approximation to a probably more realistic situation where the mean extinction decreases with age . with the extinctions added ,",
    "the clusters become 0.5 mag fainter on the average , so the fitting interval was adjusted to @xmath164 in order to probe the same mass range . for case ( 1 ) , the slope is virtually unchanged at @xmath165 , while case ( 2 ) gives an even steeper slope of @xmath166 .",
    "this suggests that age - dependent extinction will steepen the lf slopes , but a correction for this effect would require detailed knowledge about the age distribution of the clusters involved and the variation of mean extinction with age .",
    "@xmath31 data allow ages to be derived with reasonable accuracy and masses can then be estimated with help from population synthesis models .",
    "ages for all clusters in table  [ tab : cl6946f5 ] were derived according to the `` s''-sequence calibration in @xcite , which is based on lmc clusters .",
    "the metallicity of clusters in ngc  6946 may be different from that of lmc clusters , but metallicity has only a small influence on colors for young objects , except for clusters younger than about @xmath127 years where the integrated colors are strongly affected by the rapid , strongly metallicity - dependent and poorly understood evolution of red supergiants . for such clusters ,",
    "a simple relation between broad - band colors and age no longer exists and rather than quoting uncertain age estimates they are simply listed as @xmath167 years in table  [ tab : cl6946f5 ] .",
    "note that s - sequence ages are not strongly affected by reddening ",
    "a @xmath20band extinction of 1 mag will typically lead to the cluster ages being overestimated by @xmath168 dex .",
    "finally , m / l ratios from the bc2001 population synthesis models were used to estimate the mass of each cluster .",
    "the models used here assume a salpeter stellar imf with a minimum mass of 0.1 .",
    "more realistic imfs show some flattening below 0.5  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which will result in a smaller total mass than for a salpeter imf extending to 0.1 , but this does not affect the relative comparisons performed here .    fig .",
    "[ fig : age_m ] shows mass vs.  age for the clusters listed in table  [ tab : cl6946f5 ] and clearly demonstrates that any attempt to derive a meaningful mass distribution requires deeper photometry as well as a much larger sample of clusters .",
    "because of the rapid increase in m / l ratio as a function of age , illustrated by the dashed line , only the most massive clusters are detectable at ages greater than @xmath9 years or so , and an appropriate mass range can be observed only for the youngest clusters . essentially no clusters older than about 300 myrs are detected .",
    "discarding a couple of clusters with very large and uncertain ages , the most massive clusters found in this single wfpc2 pointing have masses on the order of @xmath169 , comparable to the masses of the most _ luminous _ clusters in ngc  6946 as a whole .",
    "the observed mass distribution in this field is again most likely limited by sample statistics and offers little insight as to whether or not a real upper limit to the mass distribution of clusters exists in this galaxy .",
    "the cluster populations of 6 nearby spiral galaxies have been examined on archive hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "reidentification of cluster candidates selected on ground - based images in previous work suggests a success - rate of roughly 75% for ground - based cluster selection .",
    "the ground - based photometry tends to overestimate the brightness of the clusters by up to several tenths of a magnitude , because other objects than the cluster itself are included within the relatively large apertures used for the ground - based photometry . on the other hand ,",
    "ground - based colors agree very well with the wfpc2 photometry .",
    "typical slopes for the cluster luminosity functions @xmath170 studied here are @xmath171 , clearly steeper than the @xmath10 for the milky way open cluster lf found by @xcite but in good agreement with data for lmc clusters taken from @xcite . however , the milky way data cover a much fainter magnitude interval and van den bergh & lafontaine pointed out that the lack of very luminous clusters in the milky way by itself suggests a steepening of the lf at the bright end .",
    "there is a general tendency for fits covering brighter luminosity intervals to have steeper slopes , but a direct hint of a change in slope at @xmath18 is seen only in two galaxies ( ngc  1313 and ngc  5236 ) , at the @xmath172 level .",
    "the surface densities of clusters ( @xmath97 $ ] ) scale with the area - normalized star formation rates of the host galaxies . assuming that this scaling is generally valid ,",
    "the maximum cluster luminosity expected from random sampling of the lf was estimated by extrapolation of a power - law lf with @xmath7 , scaled to the area @xmath5 and  for a sample of galaxies .",
    "both the slope and scatter of the predicted relation agree well with observations by @xcite and @xcite , spanning a wide range in  and physical dimensions .",
    "the maximum cluster luminosities are , however , overpredicted by about 0.9 mag , possibly because the mean density of clusters in the galaxies is lower than estimated from the hst pointings .",
    "some starburst dwarfs do manage to form clusters that are significantly more luminous than expected from the size of their cluster populations , indicating that the lf of young clusters in these galaxies may be peculiar .",
    "it remains to verified whether the cluster lf is really universal , concerning the slopes and their dependence on magnitude , as well as the location and even the existence of a `` bend '' in the lf .",
    "data presented here suggest that a change in slope occurs at @xmath173 , but observations of a similar bend at @xmath14 in the `` antennae '' suggest a possible dependency on factors such as environment and/or the age distribution of the clusters involved . an interesting point is whether or not the mass distribution observed in young cluster systems",
    "can be reconciled with that of old globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "the low - mass end of the old gc mass spectrum is likely to be strongly affected by dynamical evolution @xcite , but for masses above @xmath174  the mass distribution is well approximated by a power - law with slope @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat shallower than the slopes of the luminosity functions at bright magnitudes found in this paper , but similar to the faint - end slopes .",
    "the interpretation of these differences is complicated by the fact that the lf of a population of clusters with a range of ages is , in general , different from the more fundamental underlying _ mass _ distribution . in particular ,",
    "if the mass function has a physical upper limit then the lf of a cluster population with a range of ages will tend to have a steeper slope than the underlying mass distribution .",
    "this is well illustrated by the finding that the mass function of antennae clusters follows a single power - law with @xmath82 over the range @xmath176 @xcite .    because random sampling statistics appear to play an important role in determining the luminosity of the brightest clusters observed in galaxies , the role of physical processes in regulating the upper mass limit of star clusters in galaxies is difficult to determine .",
    "for galaxies with a continuous star formation history , observations of the cluster _ mass _ distribution should make it possible to establish with greater certainty how the maximum possible cluster mass depends on host galaxy properties .",
    "this , however , would require fairly accurate age estimates for large samples of clusters , down to @xmath177 or fainter .",
    "the new advanced camera for surveys on board hst will be very suitable for such studies because of its large field of view and superior sampling compared to wfpc2 .",
    "an essential ingredient in future surveys should be inclusion of @xmath99 band imaging , which would allow better age estimates as well as providing constraints on cluster reddenings .",
