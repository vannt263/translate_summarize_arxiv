    "the basic idea behind this method is to replace the sharp boundaries between the particles and the fluid with a smooth interface .",

    "finally , we note that neither the method of reflections nor the induced force method is able to directly take into account lubrication forces , caused by the relative motion of particles at short distances , as they require the high - order terms to be included in both expansions .",
    "following durlofsky et al.@xcite , these contributions are usually added to the friction matrix by assuming a pairwise superposition approximation . in this work",
    "we will consider only the collective motion of a rigid agglomerate of spheres , so that lubrication effects need not be considered .",

    "the results obtained from dns simulations are compared to the exact se values , as well as those obtained using an rpy approximation.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ] +    finally , to see in what way the structure of the helix will affect its motion , we consider the @xmath164 components of the @xmath166 and @xmath108 friction matrices , as a function of the pitch distance @xmath144 .",
    "as the pitch is increased and the helix starts to stretch , fluid flow between the turns of the helix will start to increase , while the cross sectional area of the particle ( @xmath167 plane ) is reduced .",
    "the latter will increase the torque felt by the helix ( as the particle must now drag the fluid along ) , while the former will tend to reduce it ( by reducing the moment of inertia ) .",
    "these effects give rise to the behavior seen in fig  [ f : helix_pitch ] , where the @xmath108 coefficient shows a maximum at an intermediate pitch value @xmath168 .",
    "similar behavior is observed for the @xmath166 coefficient , although the maximum is obtained at a different pitch value @xmath169 , and the coupling between rotation and translation disappears for @xmath170 and @xmath171 , as expected . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we have also plotted the results obtained using the ewald - summed rpy tensor@xcite in fig  [ f : helix_pitch ] .",
    "the agreement is surprisingly good for the @xmath158 tensor , but a considerable discrepancy appears in the coefficients of the @xmath108 tensor , as this rpy formulation does not include hydrodynamic effects arising from the particle rotation .",
    "we have extended the sp method to apply to arbitrary rigid bodies . for the moment ,",
    "we have considered only particles constructed as a rigid agglomerate of ( possibly overlapping ) spherical beads , but alternative formulations are straightforward .",
    "we have verified the accuracy of our method by performing low reynolds number dns simulations to compute the single particle friction coefficients for a large variety of rigid bodies .",
    "our results were compared with the exact solutions to the stokes equation , showing excellent agreement in all cases . while there are several methods capable of performing these type of calculations , they impose a number of restrictions which can severely limit the type of systems to which they can be applied .",
    "our method can capture the many - body hydrodynamic effects very accurately , and it is not restricted to zero reynolds number flow or newtonian host solvents . in future papers",
    "we will consider the lubrication effects of non - spherical particles ( chains , rods , disks , tori , etc ) , as well as the dynamics at high reynolds number and in the presence of a background flow fields .",
