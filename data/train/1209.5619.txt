    "in the past decades , electronic components have become continuously smaller and reached the nanoscale . at these scales ,",
    "electron transport can no longer be understood on purely classical grounds but quantum mechanical effects , such as , for example , the quantization of energy levels , quantum interference effects and tunneling processes need to be taken into account .",
    "single - molecule junctions , where a molecule is contacted by two macroscopic ( in most cases , metallic ) electrodes , represent prime examples of nanoelectronic devices . these junctions allow to investigate molecules under controllable nonequilibrium conditions and may facilitate an ultimate step in the miniaturization of nanoelectronic devices @xcite .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to understand the electron transport properties of these junctions .",
    "experimental studies employing a variety of techniques , such as mechanically controlled break junctions @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite and electromigration @xcite , have shown that molecular junctions exhibit a large variety of interesting transport phenomena , including , for example , switching @xcite , negative differential resistance @xcite , diode- and/or transistor - like behavior @xcite .",
    "many of these transport properties are not fully understood yet .",
    "on one hand , this is due to ambiguities in the contact geometry , which may lead to large variations in the recorded current - voltage characteristics @xcite .",
    "while strategies to control the contact geometry exist , for example , by the use of special linker groups @xcite , direct binding schemes @xcite , or click - chemistry approaches @xcite , the electrodes themselves may show irregular behavior .",
    "it is therefore expedient to identify transport properties of molecules that are robust with respect to the contact geometry of the contact , such as , for example , inelastic electron tunneling spectra @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "electron transport through a molecular conductor represents a complex many - body problem , where , aside from multiple electronic states , the coupling to numerous vibrational degrees of freedom has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other nanoelectronic devices ( _ e.g. _  quantum dots @xcite ) , electronic - vibrational coupling is typically rather strong in molecular systems .",
    "this is due to their small size and mass and can lead to pronounced vibrational effects in the respective transport characteristics @xcite .",
    "thereby , the interplay of electronic and the vibrational degrees of freedom of a molecular conductor often involves strong nonequilibrium @xcite as well as quantum mechanical effects @xcite .",
    "a fundamental quantum mechanical effect is quantum interference .",
    "the occurrence and observability of quantum interference effects in electron transport through molecular junctions has received great attention recently @xcite .",
    "quantum interference effects in molecular junctions arise because , very similar to a double - slit experiment , an electron may take different pathways through a molecule .",
    "thereby , pathways can be spatially different paths in molecules with an appropriate topology and/or originate from different paths in energy space , _",
    "e.g. _ , for molecules that exhibit quasidegenerate electronic states @xcite . recently , strong experimental evidence for quantum interference effects in molecular junctions has been reported @xcite . moreover ,",
    "quantum interference effects have been observed in the closely related field of electron transport through quantum dots that are set up as aharonov - bohm interferometers @xcite .",
    "depending on the magnetic flux that is threading the quantum dot , the transmission amplitudes of the electrons interfere constructively or destructively with each other , leading to sizable oscillations in the conductance of such a device @xcite .",
    "a great deal of theoretical work @xcite has been devoted to study quantum interference effects in molecular junctions , which is , on one hand , due to their fundamental importance but , on the other hand , also due to possible device applications , such as , for example , in transistors @xcite , thermoelectric devices @xcite or spin filters @xcite .",
    "thereby , in most of the studies , the effect of electron - electron interactions and electronic - vibrational coupling has been neglected .    in this article , we investigate the influence of electronic - vibrational coupling on quantum interference effects in single - molecule junctions .",
    "thereby , we extend our earlier studies @xcite and analyze in detail the mechanism of vibrationally induced decoherence .",
    "moreover , we consider the effect of local cooling by electron - hole pair creation processes and show how these processes facilitate a mechanism that allows to control quantum interference effects by an external parameter , that is , the temperature of the electrodes .",
    "only recently , this mechanism has been experimentally verified by ballmann _",

    "@xcite for a number of different junctions , including different molecular species .",

    "we employ a nonequilibrium green s function approach developed by galperin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which was recently extended by some of us to account for multiple vibrational @xcite as well as multiple electronic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the approach is based on a separation of electronic and vibrational time scales and , therefore , allows a nonperturbative description of electronic - vibrational coupling as it is required in this nonequilibrium transport problem .",
    "moreover , it suits to describe quasidegenerate levels , which exhibit pronounced quantum interference effects . besides this approach",

    "the molecular bridge may respond to this current , in particular , to the fluctuations of its charge state , which are induced by the tunneling electrons , by adapting its geometrical structure .",
    "if the equilibrium positions of the nuclei are different in the different charge states that are probed by the transferred electrons ( which is usually the case ) , transitions between the different vibrational levels become available , and the vibrational degrees of freedom of the junction may be excited according to the standard franck - condon picture @xcite .",

    "a discussion of the effect of electron - electron interactions on the transport characteristics of a molecular junction can be found , for example , in our earlier work , refs .  , or in refs .  .",
    "in this context , it is interesting to note that for high bias voltage and within the wide - band approximation , electron - electron interactions have no substantial influence on the electrical current .",
    "this was shown by gurvitz and prager @xcite based on their exact microscopic rate equation methodology . at small ( finite ) bias voltages , however , it has already been demonstrated that in the presence of electron - electron interactions quantum interference effects become quenched by spin - flip processes @xcite .",
    "we like to stress that these effects are interesting on their own and very important , but that they are beyond the scope of this work",
    ".      the central quantities in ( nonequilibrium ) green s function theory are the single - particle green s functions , which are given for the electronic degrees of freedom by @xmath43 they allow to calculate all single - particle observables , such as , _ e.g. _ , the population of levels or the current flowing through the junction .",

    "therefore , we consider another model system in this section , model desvib2 .",
    "it is very similar to model desvib but , in contrast , includes electronic - vibrational coupling also in state @xmath97 : @xmath98 but @xmath99 ( see tab .  [ parameters ] for a complete list of parameters ) . as a consequence of the coupling to both states ,",
    "inelastic transport processes are , similar to electronic transport processes , also suppressed by destructive quantum interference effects . in contrast , however , electron - hole pair creation processes are not suppressed , because they involve the coupling of an electronic state to just one of the electrodes and not to both , and , even if the respective coupling strength is negative , its square is not .",
    "this has a strong impact on the excitation levels of junction desvib2 .",
    "the corresponding vibrational excitation characteristic is shown in fig .  [ figcoolingbyint ] by the solid black line .",
    "it exhibits very similar features as the one shown by model desvib but approximately only half of the corresponding vibrational excitation levels ( cf .",
    "[ decoherenceseqtunlinearfig]b ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that inelastic transport processes are suppressed by destructive quantum interference effects in this system while electron - hole pair creation processes are not .",
    "thus , the ratio between heating and cooling processes , which is typically between 1:2 or 1:1 for resonant electron transport through a single electronic state @xcite , is shifted towards much lower values , resulting in much lower levels of vibrational excitation .",
    "this cooling effect is even more pronounced , if the level spacing between the two electronic states is smaller and , consequently , the suppression of inelastic transport processes is more pronounced . the solid blue and red line in fig .",

    "such pairs of electronic states are often found in realistic models of single - molecule junctions @xcite .",
    "the cooling mechanism described in this section can , therefore , be expected to occur in a large variety of single - molecule junctions .      in sec .",
    "[ localcool ] , we have shown that electron - hole pair creation processes facilitate an important cooling mechanism for the vibrational degrees of freedom of a single - molecule contact @xcite , particularly in the presence of strong destructive quantum interference effects .",
    "within the local representation of the linear molecular conductor by two localized molecular orbitals ( as in fig .",

    "the two parts of the molecule behave as being part of the left or right electrode , that is they also acquire the same equilibrium state .",
    "this thermalization is facilitated by electron - hole pair creation processes and is comparable to the thermalization of a molecule adsorbed on a surface with the substrate .",
    "thus , the temperature in the electrodes can be used to control the excitation levels of the vibrational modes of the left and the right part of such a molecular conductor .",
    "moreover , as higher levels of vibrational excitation enhance the effect of vibrationally induced decoherence ( see sec .  [ sequtunreg ] ) , the temperature in the electrodes can , in turn , be used to control quantum interference effects in single - molecule junctions .",

    ", the stability of the contact geometry can often only be maintained for low temperature variations @xcite . in order to demonstrate control of quantum interference effects via the temperature of the electrodes , we therefore consider a model of a single - molecule contact that includes low - frequency vibrational modes , which , in the given range of temperatures , exhibit significant changes in their excitation levels . to this end",
    ", we consider a mode with a frequency of @xmath105mev , which represents a frequency value at the lower end of the vibrational spectrum of a larger molecule @xcite .",

    "[ figtempdep ] .",
    "thereby , we have used a bias voltage of @xmath111ev@xmath112 , which corresponds to the resonant transport regime of this junction .",
    "note that , at this bias voltage , the current level of junction descool is influenced neither by the thermal broadening of the fermi distribution functions in the leads @xcite nor vibrational sidepeaks that are associated with the onset of resonant excitation processes ( fig .",
    "[ basmech]a ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figtempdep ] , however , the current and the excitation level of the vibrational mode increases substantially with the temperature in the electrodes .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the quenching of destructive quantum interference effects by inelastic transport processes , which is enhanced , via the thermalization mechanism described above , for higher temperatures of the electrodes .",
    "this shows that the temperature in the electrodes can be used to control destructive quantum interference effects in a single - molecule junction .",

    "accordingly , the solid blue / green lines in fig .  [ figtempdep ] represent the temperature characteristics of model descool that we obtain by reducing / increasing the two coupling strengths by @xmath97mev .",
    "these results corroborate that vibrationally induced decoherence is , to a large extent , driven by nonequilibrium effects ( see , e.g. , the discussion at the end of sec .",
    "[ sequtunreg ] ) , because for smaller electronic - vibrational coupling strengths we find lower levels of vibrational excitation and , due to the consequently less effective quenching of destructive interference effects , a more pronounced suppression of the current level . as a result ,",
    "the relative temperature dependence @xmath114 is stronger for weaker electronic - vibrational coupling strengths in this system .",
    "it should be noted at this point that , in systems where destructive interference effects are not active , weaker electronic - vibrational coupling is typically associated with larger levels of vibrational excitation @xcite .",
    "this counterintuitive phenomenon is related to the suppression electron - hole pair creation processes , which , in the resonant transport regime , is more pronounced for higher bias voltages but also for weaker electronic - vibrational coupling .",
    "this suppression of pair creation processes is counterbalanced in transport through junction descool due to the presence of destructive interference effects .",
    "we have investigated the role of vibrations in electron transport through single - molecule junctions , which are governed by strong quantum interference effects . to this end , we have employed both analytical and numerical results that are obtained from nonequilibrium green s function theory @xcite .",
    "our results show that electronic - vibrational coupling has a strong and non - trivial influence on the transport properties of a molecular conductor , in particular , if quantum interference effects play a dominant role .",
    "this has been demonstrated by investigating models of molecular junctions , where pronounced quantum interference effects arise due to the existence of quasidegenerate states . on one hand ,",
    "these states provide different pathways for a tunneling electron , which gives rise to strong interference effects in the respective transport properties . on the other hand , however , each of these states is , in general , also very specifically coupled to the vibrational degrees of freedom of the junction such that interaction of the tunneling electrons with the vibrations gives information about their tunneling pathway . this which - path information quenches the interference effects that are inherent to transport through quasidegenerate states .",
    "as we have shown , this decoherence mechanism is more pronounced for higher levels of vibrational excitation or , equivalently , higher effective temperatures of the vibrations , because the probability for an interaction of the tunneling electron with the vibrations increases with temperature .",
    "for example , at high bias voltages , where resonant transport processes may result in high levels of vibrational excitation , vibrationally induced decoherence is therefore very pronounced and quantum interference effects play only a minor role . at the onset of the resonant transport regime ,",
    "however , interference effects may result in sizable effects , such as , for example , a reorganization of step heights in the current - voltage characteristics or a modification of the widths of these steps . at low bias voltages or in the non - resonant transport regime , where the excitation levels of the vibrational modes are typically rather low",
    ", vibrationally induced decoherence is less pronounced . in this regime , the interplay between interference and decoherence may , nevertheless , result in a strong modification of the signals that are associated with inelastic electron tunneling .",
    "for example , in the presence of destructive interference effects , the onset of inelastic processes is , in general , more pronounced , while in the presence of constructive interference effects the respective signals are suppressed or even reversed . as a result ,",
    "negative jumps in the conductance - voltage characteristic can appear , although the conductance of the molecule is much smaller than the conductance quantum @xcite .",
    "a correct and thorough analysis of vibrational signals in the transport characteristics of a single - molecule contact needs to take into account these effects , as they may lead to strong deviations from the commonly employed franck - condon picture .",
    "we have also elucidated the role of electron - hole pair creation processes in the presence of strong destructive quantum interference effects .",
    "in contrast to transport processes , electron - hole pair creation processes are not suppressed by interference effects and , therefore , constitute the dominant inelastic processes in such junctions . at low temperatures of the electrodes",
    ", they are solely cooling the vibrational degrees of freedom . in this case",
    ", the effective temperature of the vibrational modes is only very weakly influenced by inelastic electron transport processes and rather determined by the temperature of the electrodes . because the level of vibrational excitation determines , inter alia , the efficiency of vibrationally induced decoherence in such a junction",
    ", electron - hole pair creation processes thus facilitate an effective mechanism to control quantum interference effects in single - molecule junctions by an external control parameter , that is the temperature of the electrodes .",
    "this has recently been demonstrated in experiments on a variety of different molecular junctions by ballmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "while we have presented a comprehensive study of vibrationally induced decoherence in single - molecule junctions , further research is required that addresses not only the anti - adiabatic regime but also the adiabatic and the respective cross - over regime . as quantum interference effects appear in particular for quasi - degenerate electronic states , it is also interesting to investigate the effect of non - adiabatic electronic - vibrational coupling @xcite in these systems . moreover",
    ", the analysis should be extended to regimes , where the renormalized electron - electron interactions @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] ) are not negligible .",
    "these extensions require the development of theoretical methods that allow a nonperturbative description of electron - electron interactions as well as electronic - vibrational coupling , including higher order effects and correlations .",
