    "spin qubits confined in semiconductor quantum dots are promising candidates for quantum computing@xcite due to their demonstrated long coherence time , high control fidelities@xcite as well as expected scalability .",
    "a natural approach , proposed by loss and divincenzo,@xcite is to encode one qubit using the spin up and down states of a single electron .",
    "however , difficulties in performing esr - type single electron spin rotations@xcite in this type of the qubit have led researchers to propose alternative ways to encode qubits in the collective states of two or more electrons.@xcite the singlet - triplet qubit is the simplest qubit that can be controlled all - electrically via the exchange interaction,@xcite but its full control still requires a magnetic field gradient.@xcite in a seminal paper,@xcite divincenzo proposed a qubit employing certain three - spin states as the qubit , which can be controlled solely by the exchange interaction , and is thus termed as the `` exchange - only '' qubit .",
    "the exchange - only qubit , together with its variant  the resonant exchange qubit , has been experimentally demonstrated at the single - qubit level.@xcite nevertheless , hyperfine - mediated nuclear spin fluctuations@xcite as well as charge noises@xcite contribute to decoherence , preventing the implementation of more complicated operations required to operate two or more qubits , despite extensive theoretical studies on the two qubit gates.@xcite a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between noises and controls is therefore of crucial importance for the field to progress .",
    "dynamically corrected gates@xcite ( dcgs ) are useful measures to combat decoherence .",
    "inspired by the dynamical decoupling technique developed in the field of nmr quantum control,@xcite dcgs have been successfully developed to reduce both hyperfine and charge noise in the singlet - triplet qubit@xcite as well as the exchange - only qubit.@xcite the fundamental assumption of dcgs is the non - markovianity of noises , i.e. the noises are assumed to vary with a much longer time scale than typical gate operations . with this assumption ,",
    "the dcgs are tailored under the static noise model , usually by canceling the effect of noise on the evolution operator up to certain orders using piecewise constant pulses . in realistic situations ,",
    "the dcgs should work well for the low frequency components of the noises but not high frequency parts .",
    "theoretical validation of this approximation has been performed through the randomized benchmarking@xcite for the singlet - triplet qubits@xcite under the @xmath0 noise,@xcite the power spectral density of which is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown there that the dcgs offer great error reduction for @xmath6 but no error cancellation otherwise , where for the dcgs developed for the singlet - triplet qubit system@xcite the critical @xmath7 .",
    "the validity of dcgs can then be assessed by measuring the noise spectra before they are actually being implemented , the feature of which is very useful for their experimental realization because the noise spectra are typically easier to be mapped out@xcite than actually carrying out the relatively complicated composite sequences.@xcite    on the other hand , however , benchmarking of dcgs for the exchange - only qubits under realistic noises has been lacking in the literature .",
    "this is an important open question because there are considerable differences between the exchange - only qubits and singlet - triplet qubits .",
    "firstly , the pulse sequences now involve two exchange interactions thus is more complicated.@xcite secondly , the hyperfine noise not only causes dephasing as in other types of spin - qubit,@xcite but also leads to leakage outside of the computational subspace.@xcite third , the pulse sequences are longer than those of the singlet - triplet qubit.@xcite one may therefore speculate that the sequences proposed in ref .",
    "would require noises with a larger @xmath8 compared to ones for singlet - triplet qubits , namely the noise must be more correlated for the dcgs to work in the exchange - only qubit .",
    "it is unknown , without any qualitative results , that whether @xmath8 would exceed the experimentally measured value , for example @xmath9 ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) , rendering the dcgs useless .",
    "it is therefore an important problem to study the effect of dcgs undergoing realistic noise for the exchange - only qubit system , in particular the determination of @xmath8 , which implies the range of the noise spectra with which the dcgs work .    in this paper",
    ", we perform a numerical study on how dcg pulses perform under @xmath0 noises for the exchange - only qubit .",
    "we focus on the sequences developed in ref .   which correct the hyperfine noise .",
    "we numerically simulate the randomized benchmarking,@xcite comparing sequences composed of uncorrected and corrected single - qubit clifford gates respectively .",
    "we find that the critical noise exponent for the dcgs developed in ref .",
    "is @xmath10 .",
    "although this value is larger than that found for the supcode sequences of singlet - triplet qubits , it is still lower than the experimentally measured ones available in the literature,@xcite reaffirming the noise - compensating power of the dcg sequences .",
    "we also discuss the filter transfer functions@xcite , which offer complementarily useful information to the benchmarking.@xcite    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we give a summary of the model of an exchange - only qubit , the noise involved , and the dcgs that we are going to employ in this work .",

    "these ideal rotations are denoted as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which can then be utilized to implement arbitrary single - qubit rotations .",
    "operations of an exchange - only qubit are subject to two major channels of noises .",
    "the nuclear noise , @xmath40 , causes dephasing within the logical subspace and leakage to state @xmath41 . the charge noise , on the other hand , results in errors of the the control .",
    "dynamically corrected gates are developed in order to combat these noises and improve the fidelity of the gate control , with the fundamental idea being the `` self - compensation '' of error . in particular , for the exchange - only qubits , it has been shown that cancellation of the leading order error arising from the hyperfine noise can be achieved by a composite pulse sequence containing 18 pieces .",
    "further , if simultaneous resilience of charge noise and hyperfine noise is desired , a longer composite pulse consists of 13 properly combined hyperfine - noise - corrected sequence can cancel both noises to their leading orders.@xcite these composite pulses are theoretically tailored based on a complete cycle of permutation between different spins , the symmetry property of which has greatly simplified the problem .",
    "an important assumption behind the family of dynamically corrected gates is the non - markovianity of noises .",
    "while this quasi - static - noise approximation is justified by the fact that the time scale with which the noise varies is much longer than the typical gate operation time , it remains necessary to benchmark these gate sequences in a more realistic time - dependent noise environment , for example the @xmath0 noise.@xcite this practice has been done for the supcode sequence developed for the singlet - triplet qubit,@xcite and the conclusion is that the dcgs will generally offer improvement for the noise exponent @xmath42 but not otherwise .",
    "however , the benchmarking remains to be done for the exchange - only qubit because there are important differences .",
    "as mentioned above , the pulse sequences for the exchange - only qubit involve two - axis exchange control and are longer than supcode .",
    "moreover , there is one additional channel of error  the leakage  which needs to be treated .",

    "while the fidelities or errors of individual quantum gates are of great interest , they can not be straightforwardly used to predict the fidelity of a quantum algorithm , which involves a number of such gates . moreover , when the noises are time - dependent , the duration of one quantum gate is typically too short for the noise to exhibit the desired spectrum .",
    "a widely - used approach to this problem is the randomized benchmarking.@xcite the benchmarking is implemented by averaging the gate fidelities over random sequences of gates drawn from a subset of quantum gates  the clifford group  undergoing different realizations of noises .",
    "the average gate fidelity is then obtained by performing an exponential fit to the fidelity decay curve .",

    "we have averaged the fidelities of at least 500 random gate sequences undergoing different noise realizations for a given noise spectrum before the exponential fit is made .",
    "[ fig : fidplot ] shows the results of the randomized benchmarking of the single - qubit clifford gates , comparing the uncorrected ones and ones corrected against the hyperfine noise .",
    "the fidelities decay approximately exponentially , and they saturate at a value of @xmath96 .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical investigation of situations involving leakage.@xcite the gate error inferred from the decay of the fidelity is therefore a combination of the dephasing and leakage error .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](a ) shows the case with @xmath97 , meaning that the noise is very much similar to a white noise and one does not expect that the composite pulse should offer any improvement .",
    "in fact , the steep initial drop of the red line indicates that the corrected sequences have much larger error compared to the uncorrected pulses , represented by the smoothly decaying blue line . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](b ) where @xmath98 , it is still the case that the error is larger for the corrected sequences , but the differences from the uncorrected pulse are smaller .",
    "as @xmath2 further increases , the noise concentrates more at low frequencies and the composite pulses work better , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](c)-(f ) . to make the comparison clear , we have chosen the amplitudes for noises with different exponents such that the error for the uncorrected pulses are comparable for these panels .",
    "we note that it is difficult to make a direct comparison between noises with different @xmath2 values because they have different energies .",
    "therefore we show typical results for noises with specific amplitudes in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot ] , but consider the dependences of gate error on the noise amplitudes in the next step . for @xmath80 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](c ) ] , the error for uncorrected and corrected sequences are comparable , although that for the corrected sequences is still a little larger than the uncorrected ones for the amplitude @xmath99 . at @xmath100 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](d ) ] the corrected sequences start to offer improvements , and the improvements becomes much more pronounced as @xmath2 becomes even larger .",
    "for @xmath101 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](e ) ] , the gate error has been substantially suppressed by the corrected sequence so that after 500 gates the fidelity is still larger than 0.5 . in the case of @xmath102 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](f ) ] , the fidelity is maintained above 80% after 500 gate operations , indicating the strong power of the noise - corrected sequences .",
    "we fit the fidelity decaying curves as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fidplot ] to @xmath103 where the fidelity decay constant @xmath104 is related to both the dephasing and leakage error of the quantum gates .",
    "it is difficult and unnecessary to separate the two for this work , since our main focus is to investigate the improvement of the overall gate fidelity by composite pulses under different noise conditions .",
    "we will therefore use the fidelity decay constant @xmath104 as a measure of the gate error , without distinguishing different kinds of error .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : aveerror ] we show the dependence of the fitted fidelity decay constant @xmath104 on the noise amplitude @xmath73 .",
    "this can be considered as a summary of all benchmarking results , among which only representative results have been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot ] . for small @xmath2 ,",
    "the noise is similar to the white noise and dynamically corrected gates will not reduce the error but rather increase it , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : aveerror](a ) and ( b ) . for an intermediate value of @xmath80 , uncorrected and corrected pulses",
    "have similar performances . as @xmath2 increases ,",
    "the noises become more correlated and the corrected sequences outperform the uncorrected ones .",
    "[ fig : aveerror](d ) shows that for @xmath100 and small enough noise @xmath105 the dynamically corrected gates have reduced the error by about an order of magnitude , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : aveerror](e ) , we see that the error reduction becomes about two orders of magnitude for the case of @xmath101 .",
    "the reduction is almost three orders of magnitude when @xmath2 is as large as 3 , in which case the noise becomes slowly varying and is similar to the quasi - static noise originally conceived in the development of the dynamically corrected gates .",
    "these are consistent with the qualitative consideration that dcgs work better for low frequency noises but would produce even larger errors than uncorrected pulses if the noise contains a substantial higher - frequency part .    in order to further understand how the improvement made by dynamically corrected gates relates to the structure of the noise , we define an improvement ratio @xmath106 as the ratio between errors resulted from the uncorrected and corrected pulses under the same noise condition . we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : aveerror ] that for noises with small enough amplitudes the two curves becomes two parallel lines , and a ratio between them is well defined .",
    "the reason is that while the dynamically corrected gates can fully cancel zero frequency noise and can compensate the majority of the contributions from low frequencies , it can not fully remove the effect of low frequency noises , let alone higher frequency parts .",
    "therefore the first - order correction to the evolution operator due to the noises , proportional to @xmath73 , always exist and such dependence will be made clear when @xmath73 is sufficiently small .",
    "therefore the defined improvement ratio @xmath106 is essentially the ratio between the coefficients of the leading - order error in the gate fidelity for uncorrected and corrected sequences .",
    "note that for @xmath102 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fidplot](f ) ] , the two lines are not parallel for @xmath107 and the error shows different scaling . here",
    ", the noise varies so slowly and the dcgs works so well that compared to the second order error in the evolution operator , the first order error is almost removed by the dynamically corrected gates . nevertheless , for sufficiently small @xmath73 ( in this case one must go down to @xmath108 ) the two lines will still become parallel . in practice due to",
    "the lower bound to @xmath73 and @xmath104 imposed by the machine precision the range that the two lines are approximately parallel is much narrower than other cases , but we have still been able to obtain a meaningful @xmath106 for this situation . in any case , if @xmath106 is taken before the two lines becomes parallel then the actual improvement can only be larger than that value .",
    "therefore one may consider that such a fit may slightly underestimate the improvement afforded by the dynamically corrected gates .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] we show the improvement ratio @xmath106 versus the noise exponent @xmath2 .",
    "this is the core result of this paper as it provides useful information to the experimentalists who are to implement the dcgs developed in ref .  .",
    "from the figure we can clearly see that for small @xmath2 ( white - like noise ) , @xmath110 , meaning that dynamically corrected gates produce larger error than the uncorrected ones due to their prolonged gate time . for large @xmath2 ( quasi - static noise )",
    "dynamically corrected gates offer great improvements as seen by the large @xmath106 value in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "it is therefore important to know the critical exponent @xmath8 where the two situation cross .",
    "we have found that for the dcgs developed to combat the hyperfine noise in the exchange - only qubit,@xcite @xmath5 . this value is larger than the @xmath8 previously found for the singlet - triplet qubits.@xcite the reasons that dcgs for the exchange - only qubit requires a more correlated noise than the singlet - triplet qubit case to take effect possibly include the complexity of the pulse sequences ( two control pulses for the exchange - only versus one for the singlet - triplet qubits ) , and most likely the presence of an additional channel of decoherence , the leakage .",
    "fortunately , experimentally measured noise exponent for gaas systems are still much larger than @xmath5 ( in refs .",
    "@xmath2 has been measured to be @xmath111 ) . in ref .",
    ", the noise spectrum has been measured to be @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "converting to our units it implies that @xmath114 . taking @xmath115 then @xmath116 . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig : aveerror](e ) we see that this is in a range where the dynamically corrected gates offer about two orders of magnitude reduction in the error induced by the hyperfine noise .",
    "these qualitative considerations indicate that the dynamically corrected gates , proposed in ref .  , are very useful to cancel hyperfine noises in actual experiments .",
    "another important characterization of the noise - canceling ability of quantum gates is the filter transfer function.@xcite the filter transfer function was introduced in systems involving two states and because of the presence of a leaked state in our case , the formalism needs to be slightly modified .",

    "( 24 ) in ref .  ] as @xmath139 one can also readily verify that @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 all vanish for our problem .",

    "in particular , contributions of @xmath145 and @xmath146 relate to dephasing , and those of @xmath147 and @xmath148 relate to leakage .",
    "eq .   and can therefore be interpreted that contributions to the hyperfine - noise - induced gate error from leakage is about twice as large as dephasing error .",
    "figure  [ fig : filtfunc ] shows the results of these filter transfer functions for a chosen quantum gate , the hadamard gate @xmath149 .",
    "the filter transfer functions for other gates are very similar and are thus not shown here .",
    "the blue lines show the filter transfer functions for the uncorrected sequences while red ones correspond to the dcgs corrected against the hyperfine noise .",
    "the difference in scaling is apparent for all cases because the corrected pulses completely suppress leading order errors , and in realistic situations one must multiply the filter functions and the noise spectra to obtain the corrections to the fidelity as eq .  .",

    "the gate error derived from the randomized benchmarking , because the former is for individual gates while the latter is an average for a sequence of gates .",

    "we see that the errors are of the same order of magnitude for noises with the same amplitude and exponent , providing an independent check for our results of randomized benchmarking as well as the filter transfer functions .",
