    "in accessing dense baryonic matter , one possible approach that unifies both the elementary baryons and multi - baryons system was proposed in refs .  @xcite . in this approach , starting with a chiral lagrangian , the single baryon is generated as a skyrmion and multi - skyrmions are put on crystal lattice to simulate many - baryon systems and dense matter .",
    "however , the previous works in this approach suffer from the modeling of the effective chiral lagrangian and determination of the low energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "this problem becomes serious when one considers higher order chiral lagrangian or introduce more mesonic degrees of freedom , which prevents systematic studies for skyrmion properties . on the other hand , when one starts with holographic qcd ( hqcd ) models and integrates out infinite towers of mesons such as vector and axial - vector mesons except a few low - lying mesons as done in refs .",
    "@xcite , it leads to a chiral lagrangian with the values of all the lecs fixed by only a few phenomenological inputs .",
    "therefore , the number of parameters is drastically reduced , which allows the studies on skyrmions in a systematic way . in the present article",
    ", we use the general master formula derived in this way to determine the lecs of the @xmath2 terms of the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) lagrangian , which leaves undetermined by theory the pion decay constant , vector meson mass , and the hls parameter @xmath5 .",
    "as will be shown , all physical observables that we will consider are independent of @xmath5 .",
    "so by fixing the pion decay constant and the vector meson mass from the meson sector , we are able to study the skyrmion properties in a totally parameter - independent way , a feat that as far as we know , has not been achieved before . in addition",
    ", we work with the chiral lagrangian including the homogeneous wess - zumino ( hwz ) terms for studying the role of the @xmath1 vector meson in the properties of a single skyrmion .",
    "this is our first step towards more complete studies on skyrmions for nucleon structure and baryonic matter .",
    "the main results of this work were quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and here we provide the details of the calculations in this model as well as more detailed analyses on the skyrmion mass and size .    the skyrme model  @xcite is the nonlinear sigma model stabilized by the skyrme term , a four - derivative term , where the baryons emerge as stable field configurations with a non - trivial geometrical structure .",
    "it is well accepted that the nonlinear sigma model captures the physics of qcd at very low energy scales and as the energy scales increase vector mesons should be excited .",
    "an elegant way to describe the vector meson physics is the hidden local symmetry ( hls )  @xcite in which the vector mesons emerge as the gauge bosons of the hls .",
    "furthermore , as the energy scale goes up , infinite number of local symmetries appear and the corresponding gauge fields are identified with the infinite vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "these infinite number of hidden gauge vector fields together with the pion field in 4-dimension ( 4d ) can be dimensionally de - constructed to 5-dimensional ( 5d ) yang - mills ( ym ) action in curved space  @xcite with the 5th dimension being the energy scale .",
    "a similar situation exits in the gravity sector ( that is referred to as  bulk \" sector ) of gravity / gauge ( holographic ) duality that comes from string theory .",
    "( see , for example , a recent review addressed to hadron physicists in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . )",
    "when kaluza - klein(kk)-decomposed to 4d and all the kk modes except the lowest lying vector mesons and pseudoscalar mesons are integrated out in a way consistent with hidden local symmetry from the bulk sector , this model is dual to the hls up to @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this dual ( bulk - sector ) model is justified in the large number of colors @xmath3 , large t hooft coupling @xmath8 limit and the chiral limit where the quark masses vanish .",
    "furthermore , baryons can be described as solitons in the holographic qcd  @xcite .",
    "the hqcd model includes only two parameters , @xmath4 and the kk mass @xmath9 , which can be fixed from meson physics .",
    "this , therefore , enables a parameter - free calculation of the skyrmion properties with vector mesons and provides a way to perform a systematic study on the role of vector mesons in the skyrmion structure .",
    "here , the five - dimensional chern - simons ( cs ) term that is responsible for the anomalous part of the hls lagrangian is a topological quantity and , therefore , is free from the warping of the space - time . as we shall see below",
    ", the cs term is very important to understand the role of the @xmath1 meson in the soliton structure .    in the literature",
    ", skyrmion has been studied based on the @xmath10 hls lagrangian as in refs  @xcite .",
    "this model has three parameter , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath5 , where @xmath11 is the pion decay constant , @xmath12 is the hls gauge coupling constant , and @xmath5 is a free parameter in the hls .",
    "( see section  [ sec : skyrfull ] for the definition of these parameters . )",
    "the hls parameter @xmath5 is normally taken to be @xmath13  @xcite . in free space",
    "@xmath14 is preferred but in hadronic medium at high temperature and/or density , one gets @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of @xmath5 on circumstances hinders systematic investigation on the properties of a single skyrmion and baryonic matter .",
    "for example , the soliton mass reported in ref .",
    "@xcite within a @xmath0-meson stabilized model is @xmath16 for @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and the pion mass effect is found to be small in the soliton mass .",
    "this shows that the ambiguity in the value of @xmath5 results in a large uncertainty in the soliton mass .",
    "furthermore , the description of baryons as skyrmions is supported by the large @xmath3 limit  @xcite . in the hls ,",
    "the higher order terms such as the @xmath2 terms are at @xmath19 like the @xmath10 terms .",
    "lagrangian to the @xmath2 terms are @xmath20 and therefore are sub - dominant .",
    "we do not consider the @xmath21 lagrangian in the present work .",
    "] as a result , in the @xmath3 counting , these higher order terms should be taken into account .",
    "however , including the higher order terms inevitably calls for more complicated form of the lagrangian and uncontrollably large number of low energy constants . in this paper",
    ", these constants will be determined in a controllable way by using a master formula .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : skyrfull ] , we introduce the hls lagrangian up to @xmath2 including all the hwz terms .",

    "<S> the roles of light @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons in the skyrmion are investigated in a chiral lagrangian derived from the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) up to @xmath2 including the homogeneous wess - zumino ( hwz ) terms . </S>",
    "<S> we write a general  master formula \" that allows us to determine the parameters of the hls lagrangian from a class of holographic qcd models valid at large @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( t hooft constant ) limit by integrating out the infinite towers of vector and axial - vector mesons other than the lowest @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . within this approach </S>",
    "<S> we find that the physical properties of the skyrmion as the solitonic description of baryons are _ independent _ of the hls parameter @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the only parameters of the model are the pion decay constant and the vector meson mass . once determined in the meson sector </S>",
    "<S> , we have a totally parameter - free theory that allows us to study unequivocally the role of light vector mesons in the skyrmion structure . </S>",
    "<S> we find , as suggested by sutcliffe , that inclusion of the @xmath0 meson reduces the soliton mass , which makes the skyrmion come closer to the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) soliton , but the role of the @xmath1 meson is found to increase the soliton mass . in a stark contrast </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath6-@xmath7 mass difference , which is determined by the moment of inertia in adiabatic collective quantization of the skyrmion , is increased by the @xmath0 vector meson , while it is reduced by the inclusion of the @xmath1 meson . </S>",
    "<S> all these observations show the importance of the @xmath1 meson in the properties of the nucleon and nuclear matter in the skyrme model . </S>"
