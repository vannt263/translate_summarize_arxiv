    "the coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom is one of the interesting topics of condensed matter research @xcite .",
    "it has drawn renewed interest in connection with potentially useful electronic materials , such as colossal magnetoresistive and multiferroic materials .",
    "one of the most dominant effects of this coupling is the spontaneous exchange striction associated with the magnetic ordering at lower temperatures .",
    "if the material does not contain any magnetic ions , the temperature variation of the volume is smooth and shows no anomalies at low temperatures .",
    "however , if the material contains magnetic ions that order at low temperature , then at this transition temperature the positions of the atoms may be modified .",
    "the most easily probed effects are the modifications of the unit cell parameters and the unit cell volume .",
    "sometimes the lattice symmetry may get modified following the symmetry of the magnetically ordered state .",
    "the symmetry change at the ordering temperatures also causes crystallographic and/or magnetic domains to be formed in single crystal samples .",
    "in addition to the lattice strain effects , important modifications in the positional parameters of the atoms and also in the bond distances may take place . however , these modifications are more difficult to detect because the effects are small . to effectively measure this , one needs the temperature variation of the diffraction intensities and , preferably , the diffuse scattering up to high momentum transfer of the scattered radiation .",
    "a particularly complex situation arises for magnetic structures with the propagation vector @xmath9 . in this case",
    ", the magnetic reflections occur at the same position as the nuclear reflections and the refinement of the magnetic and crystal structures become fraught with great difficulties .",
    "ymno@xmath0 belongs to the family of hexagonal manganites rmno@xmath0 ( r = sc , y , er , ho , tm , yb , lu ) that show multiferroic behaviour @xcite .",
    "these hexagonal manganites are paraelectric at high temperatures with the centrosymmetric space group @xmath10 .",
    "below about 1000 k they undergo a paraelectric - to - ferroelectric transition to the non - centrosymmetric structure with the space group @xmath11 .",
    "[ structure ] shows schematically the crystal structure of ymn@xmath12 in the ferroelectric phase . at lower temperatures , of the order of about 100 k , the magnetic hexagonal manganites order with a non - collinear antiferromagnetic structure with a propagation vector @xmath9 . among these hexagonal manganites",
    "ymno@xmath0 and homno@xmath0 have been investigated quite intensively @xcite . here",
    "we report the powder neutron diffraction investigation of the temperature dependence of the crystal and magnetic structure of ymno@xmath0 .",
    "we have observed strong magnetoelastic effects or spontaneous magnetostriction below the nel temperature @xmath1 k. the lattice strains are found to be proportional to the square of the ordered magnetic moments of the mn ions .    in order to determine quantitatively the magnetoelastic effect or the spontaneous magnetostriction , we need to measure the temperature variation of the lattice parameters and the unit cell volume .",
    "the high temperature data above the ordering temperature can be fitted to either a debye model , using the grneisen approximation , @xcite or the simpler einstein model and then extrapolated to lower temperatures to give the background variations in the absence of magnetism .",
    "the simpler einstein - grneisen equation serves as an excellent fit function for not only the volume but also for the individual lattice parameters @xcite and we have used it here .",
    "neutron diffraction experiments were done on ymno@xmath0 on the high intensity powder diffractometer @xcite d20 of the institute laue - langevin in grenoble .",
    "the @xmath13 reflection from a ge monochromator at a high take - off angle of @xmath14 gave a neutron wavelength of 1.868  .",
    "approximately 3 g of powdered ymno@xmath0 was placed inside an @xmath15 mm diameter vanadium can , which was fixed to the sample stick of a standard @xmath16he cryostat .",
    "we measured the diffraction intensities from ymno@xmath0 as a temperature in the range @xmath17 k. the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ lamp ] shows the temperature variation of the diffraction intensities of ymno@xmath0 whereas the lower panel shows a similar plot in a limited low @xmath18 range showing the temperature variation of the peaks with a dominant magnetic contribution .",
    "the magnetic contributions to the intensity are clearly seen in the plot of the lower panel .",
    "the reflections like h0l with l = odd disappear completely at @xmath3 as they are forbidden reflections in the space group @xmath11 and have only magnetic contribution and therefore become zero at @xmath3 .",
    "the other reflections that have both magnetic and nuclear contributions attain a constant value ( nuclear ) above @xmath3 .",
    "the rietveld refinement @xcite of the diffraction data was done using the fullprof program @xcite .",
    "the refinement results from ymno@xmath0 at t = 2 k and 300 k are shown in fig .",
    "[ ymnorefinement ] . at t",
    "= 2 k , the intensity data have been fitted with the crystal and the magnetic structure model @xcite of ymno@xmath0 . at t",
    "= 300 k , in the paramagnetic state , the refinement was done with the crystal structure model only .",
    "figure [ ymnolattice ] shows the temperature variation of the lattice parameters @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and the unit cell volume @xmath19 of ymno@xmath0 plotted on the left panel .",
    "the lattice parameter @xmath2 decreases continuously with decreasing temperature but , close to the nel temperature @xmath1 k , shows a magnetoelastic or magnetostriction anomaly . the red curve represents the background variation of the @xmath2 lattice parameter for a non - magnetic solid obtained by fitting the data in the paramagnetic state by the einstein - grneisen equation . by subtracting the background from the data we determined the lattice strain @xmath6 , plotted on the right panel of figure [ ymnolattice ] .",
    "the @xmath5 lattice parameter increases continuously with decreasing temperature down to @xmath3 and then shows an anomalous increase or positive magnetostriction . by subtracting the background variation of the @xmath5 lattice parameter ( red continuous curve ) from the data we determined the lattice strain @xmath7 plotted on the right panel .",
    "similar plots for the unit cell volume @xmath19 and and the volume strain @xmath8 are shown in figure [ ymnolattice ] in the left and the right panels , respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 ratio , which is @xmath21 at @xmath22 k , increases linearly with decreasing temperature down to the nel temperature and then attains a constant value @xmath23 at low temperatures .",
    "a closer inspection of the temperature variation of the lattice parameters shows that the magnetoelastic effects become actually noticeable at temperatures substantially above t@xmath24 k. we can tentatively assign a temperature @xmath25 k at which the magnetoelastic effect first becomes noticeable .",
    "the appearance of the magnetoelastic effect at temperature higher than @xmath3 is presumably due to the short - range spin correlations .",
    "the spontaneous linear magnetostriction along the @xmath2-axis at t = 0 is @xmath26 and that along the @xmath5-axis is @xmath27 .",
    "the spontaneous volume magnetostriction @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "here @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the extrapolated lattice parameters and the unit cell volumes at @xmath33 for a fictitious non - magnetic solid obtained by the method described in the previous section . note that although we determined @xmath34 by fitting the non - magnetic background and subtracting the experimentally determined unit cell volume , one can also calculate this from the relation @xmath35 .",
    "the calculated value turns out to be @xmath36 , very close to the value @xmath29 determined semi - independently .",
    "this indicates that the method we used for the determination of the non - magnetic background is reliable or at least consistent .",
    "one must however point out that the paramagnetic and fictitious non - magnetic background volumes are not really the same but we have assumed this to be the case for simplicity during the present analysis .",
    "figure [ moment ] shows the temperature variation of the @xmath37-component of the ordered magnetic moment @xmath38 of the mn ion , obtained by fitting the measured bragg intensities of the nuclear and magnetic reflections with the known crystal and magnetic structure models .",
    "the ordered magnetic moment decreases with increasing temperature and becomes zero at @xmath39 k. we did not have enough data points close to @xmath3 and therefore the critical exponent @xmath40 could not be determined .",
    "one expects that the spontaneous magnetostriction is proportional to the square of the ordered magnetic moment .",
    "this is at least the case for volume magnetostriction for a single sublattice ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "however our recent investigations @xcite on transition metal difluorides mf@xmath41 ( m = mn , co , fe , ni ) showed that this is also the case for these simple antiferromagnets with the rutile structure .",
    "to check the coupling between the spontaneous magnetostriction and the ordered magnetic moment , or the order parameter of the antiferromagnetic phase transition in ymno@xmath0 , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ linear ] the lattice strains @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 vs. the square of the @xmath37-component of the ordered magnetic moment of the mn ion .",
    "the linear plots show that the lattice strains in ymno@xmath0 indeed couple to the square of the magnetic moment or the order parameter .",
    "this result also suggests that a second - order spin hamiltonian is sufficient to describe the magnetic system of ymno@xmath0 .",
    "it is not necessary to invoke higher order spin hamiltonian consisting of , for example , four - spin exchange for ymno@xmath0 .",
    "although we were successful in determining the magnetoelastic effects on the lattice parameters , our attempts to extract the temperature variation of the positional parameters of ymno@xmath0 below @xmath3 did not succeed , presumably because of the @xmath9 magnetic structure of ymno@xmath0 .",
    "in such structures , magnetic reflections arise below @xmath3 on the same positions as the reflections of structural origin . well above @xmath3 diffuse magnetic scattering",
    "is observed , becoming magnetic bragg reflections below @xmath3 .",
    "however , the magnetic scattering in general coincide with nuclear reflections",
    ". there are only a few pure magnetic reflections where structural reflections are not allowed due the space group extinctions .",
    "the least squares refinement of the crystal and magnetic structures using overlapping nuclear and magnetic intensities at the same reciprocal lattice positions has the problem of separating magnetic and nuclear intensities and therefore lead to correlations between the magnetic and structural parameters . due to the correlations between structural and magnetic parameters ,",
    "the positional parameters show abnormal deviations at and near @xmath3 . also these deviations are different if you come from the high or low temperature sides in a sequential refinement in which one uses the refined parameters of the previous data set as the start parameters of that for the next data set .",
    "one way to avoid such unwanted correlations is to use polarized neutron diffraction .",
    "the other useful method to disentangle the magnetic and structural parameters is to measure neutron diffraction intensities to a very high momentum transfer @xmath42 .",
    "our present data collected on a reactor based diffractometer at the thermal neutron beam are limited to about @xmath43 @xmath44 only .",
    "such high-@xmath45 diffraction data can be collected at a spallation neutron source .",
    "one can then refine the crystal structure using only the high-@xmath45 data and the magnetic structure using only the low-@xmath45 data . in this way",
    "one can hope to get the magnetoelastic effect on the positional parameters ( bond distances , symmetric shifts etc . ) as well and not just the lattice magnetoelastic effect that we determined in the present paper .",
    "lee et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained magnetoelastic effects of the structural parameters and bond distances of ymno@xmath0 , lumno@xmath0 and y@xmath46lu@xmath46mno@xmath0 from their neutron and x - ray diffraction investigations but they have not explained how they have avoided such correlations between the structural and magnetic parameters . in the absence of such explanation it is difficult to accept the results given by these authors @xcite .",
    "it is extremely important to check the correlation matrix of the refined structural and magnetic parameters , especially in the case of a @xmath9 magnetic structure , because the structural and magnetic intensities appear at the same reciprocal lattice points and least squares refinement process involves dividing the intensities into structural and magnetic parts rather arbitrarily .",
    "only polarized neutron diffraction can separate the magnetic and structural contributions directly and the authors @xcite did not use such a method .",
    "we also checked carefully the supplementary information of the paper in the on - line version .",
    "it contains a lot of other information but does not contain the crucial information about the correlation matrix of the least squares refinement .    in conclusion , we have investigated the spontaneous magnetoelastic effects or magnetostrction in multiferroic ymno@xmath0 by neutron powder diffraction . by subtracting the background thermal expansion for a nonmagnetic lattice from the measured thermal expansions we determined the lattice strains @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 due to the magnetoelastic effects as a function of temperature .",
    "we have also determined the temperature variation of the ordered magnetic moment of mn ion by fitting the measured bragg intensities of the nuclear and magnetic reflections with the known crystal and magnetic structure models .",
    "our results show that the lattice strain due to the spontaneous magnetostrictions in ymno@xmath0 couples with the square of the ordered magnetic moment or the square of the order parameter of the antiferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "this result also suggests that a second - order spin hamiltonian is sufficient to describe the magnetic system of ymno@xmath0 .",
