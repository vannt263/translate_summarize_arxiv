    "achieving an atomistic description of solids continues to provide a challenge to the study of materials , especially as we learn that imperfections and disorder of crystals can give rise to the emergence of unexpected materials properties .",
    "for example , the multifunctional properties of the perovskite manganites can only be explained by understanding the relationships between the local and average structures @xcite .",
    "therefore , we strive to further classify and quantify the nature of any local ordering ( short - range order ) that is patterned in a disordered fashion .",
    "pair distribution function analysis of total scattering data has become a common technique for the characterization of local distortions and disorder in crystals , as well as nanoparticle structures @xcite .",
    "modeling of atomistic structures  with emphasis on capturing the correct _ local structure _  from experimentally derived atom - atom histograms poses a great challenge , especially when the best description of the pdf has a short , finite correlation length ( a domain ) that becomes averaged into a higher symmetry in the crystallographic structure . to obtain an atomistic description of such a model with these domains ( where each domain consists of a few unit cells ) , simulations containing thousands of atoms",
    "can be used to model the total scattering data . by employing a large - scale simulation ,",
    "the limitations from periodic boundary conditions are lifted , thus allowing disordered aspects of the structure to either average out into the debye - waller factor in the case of crystalline disorder or lack any attributes of long - range order over the range of data provided in reciprocal space ( after convolution with the finite size of the simulation ) in order to describe amorphous solids @xcite .",
    "however , analysis of these large - scale atomistic ensembles containing 1000 s of atoms has been non - trivial , both in the challenge of extracting information relative to the average crystallographic structure and also in providing statistically meaningful information ; there are typically many more free parameters in these simulations than independent observations ( i.e. , data ) .",
    "herein , we develop a systematic approach for analyzing the disorder in large atomistic simulations of complex crystal structures using representational analysis .",
    "the determination of crystallographic superstructures resulting from displacive distortions via symmetry - mode analysis of a statistical distribution of ensembles has proven to be very powerful ( cf . , wo@xmath0 and lamno@xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "another similar approach , but coupled to a different analysis , has also made it possible to extract phonon dispersions from powder diffraction data @xcite . here , we use a variation of this technique adapted to understand local structural variations by projecting displacements of atoms from their average crystallographic sites in atomistic ensembles onto a tight - binding - like basis formed from the symmetry - adapted . in a single unit cell ,",
    "these modes are fully symmetry adapted ] modes of a single unit cell , as depicted in figure  [ fig : outline ]  we define these modes as _ tight - binding modes_. when displacements from an ideal crystallographic site are projected onto this _ locally _ symmetry - adapted basis , the disorder can be quantified and statistically analyzed to determine the frequency of specific displacement magnitudes and orientations .",
    "this manuscript outlines the analytical method and presents two illustrative applications of the method : the observation of a trigonal distortion in batio@xmath0 at room temperature and the identification of the local displacement modes in the charge - ice pyrochlore , bi@xmath1ti@xmath1 o@xmath2 .",
    "more broadly , our approach is equally important for the analysis of experimental diffraction and scattering data @xcite , _ ab initio _ and force - field - based simulations @xcite , and combinations of the two @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this approach provides a common language and representation for bridging experiment- and theory - derived models .",
    "the analytical method described here operates on an ensemble of atoms that can be described as a enlarged big - box generated from small crystallographic unit cells .",
    "the atom positions need not sit on precisely ordered lattice sites ; however , upon back - folding the big - box ensemble onto the parent unit cell , the average atom positions should project close to particular lattice sites , each with a position distribution resembling something like a debye - waller factor ( _ i.e. _ , the model may be paracrystalline ) .",
    "this method is agnostic to how the models are generated ; the authors refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a description of modeling total scattering data .    here",
    ", we use `` total scattering '' to refer to the scattering of x - rays or neutrons that describes the structure factor of the crystallographic symmetry ( diffraction from periodically ordered components ) and the diffuse scattering that can arise from displacements of atoms from their ideal lattice points , including displacements from thermal motion and static disorder in the crystal @xcite .",
    "if the total scattering structure factor , @xmath3 , is measured to sufficiently high momentum transfer ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) , one can numerically take a sine fourier transform to convert @xmath3 into the reduced pair distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 \\\\",

    ", atomic - scale modeling must be used to make assignments to individual peaks .",
    "`` small - box '' models , which allow extraction of bond lengths and a description of the thermal motion ( i.e. , debye - waller factors ) , can be obtained from least - squares ( ls ) optimization of a crystallographic unit cell , or some small variant thereof to the experimental pdf using the software , pdfgui.@xcite ls optimization is susceptible to finding local minima in the goodness - of - fit and is numerically cumbersome when the model contains many degrees of freedom , as applicable here .",
    "additionally , these short - range ordered models often fail to provide an accurate description of the crystallographic observations @xcite .",
    "a complimentary approach to extract atomistic configurations from the pdf is to simultaneously model both the crystallographic structure factor and the pdf by employing a `` large - box''simulation of the total scattering data .",
    "a reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) algorithm can be used to find atomistic configurations of the ensemble consistent with both the experimentally determined @xmath6 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this method is to define the atomic configurations of an ensemble as displacements from the ideal crystallographic positions . here",
    ", we define a `` large - box '' as a @xmath10 enlargement of the crystallographic unit cell to form an atomistic ensemble , but no attempt is made to constrain the symmetry between atoms , either within the subcells or the `` large - box '' .",
    "the simplest such basis is to simply write down displacement vectors , in cartesian or lattice coordinates , for each atom in the ensemble .",
    "each atom within the crystallographic unit cell , @xmath11 , has a unique position defined by a vector , @xmath12 .",
    "the vector , @xmath13 , describes the spatial vector between each unit cell , @xmath14 , within the ensemble .",
    "each atom can be mapped as a displacement from its ideal position in the crystallographic unit cell , @xmath15 , by @xmath16 , where the values @xmath15 are often determined from a traditional crystallographic analysis ( rietveld analysis or single - crystal structural refinement ) .",
    "such a representation is shown schematically for a simple two dimensional toy model , a @xmath17 `` big - box '' built from a crystallographic unit cell with two atoms and @xmath18 symmetry , in figure  [ fig : transform](a ) . while straightforward to compute , this basis ( the displacement vectors ) lacks any connection to the symmetries that are present , locally or on average , and are thus difficult to interpret .",
    "a more refined approach is to rewrite the displacements in terms of the normal modes of the crystallographic structure , with amplitudes and phases for every mode at every wavevector in the brillouin zone ( as determined by the point symmetry of each wavevector ) .",
    "this normal - mode basis provides physical insight because the atomic displacements are mapped onto symmetry - defined motions away from their ideal positions , and correlations between unit cells are captured .",
    "there is , however , an even better choice of basis that keeps many of the advantages of the classic normal mode approach but retains physical insight into the _ local _ symmetry changes .",
    "first , the local tight - binding ( _ i.e. _ , locally symmetry - adapted ) modes are identified .",
    "this is accomplished by rewriting all possible atomic motions within a single unit cell into motions consistent with the point symmetry of the crystal at the brillouin zone center , @xmath19 .",
    "each motion ( or mode ) can be labelled according to the irreducible representation that it transforms under in the point symmetry group and is described by a set of basis vectors describing the actual atomic motions .",
    "identification of these tight - binding modes is straightforward : basis vectors spanning each irreducible representations for each space group have been tabulated by kovalev @xcite , or can be computed by various crystallographic tools , including karep @xcite , sara@xmath20 @xcite , basireps @xcite , the bilbao crystallographic server ( symmetry adapted modes)@xcite , or the isotropy software suite @xcite .",
    "the input for these tools are the crystallographic space group and atom positions of the small ( crystallographic average ) unit cell as one would derive from rietveld ( or other suitable crystallographic ) analysis .",
    "these tight - binding modes provide an orthonormal and _ local _ basis for describing all possible motional degrees of freedom within a single unit cell , and are analogous to normal vibrational modes of a molecular system . to retain this physical intuition but capture the degrees of freedom of a `` large - box '' atomistic ensemble , we adopt a technique analogous to tight - binding methods in electronic structure calculations @xcite and",
    "write down modes at a non - zero wavevector in terms of these local basis functions that we define at the brillouin zone center ( a la atomic orbitals ) , with appropriate phase factors to describe correlations between crystallographic unit cells in an ensemble .",
    "specifically , we define the spatial correlations between unit cells within the ensemble with a quantized , reciprocal wavevector , @xmath21 .",
    "the vector spans the indices , @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ; in other words , the wavevectors are in steps of @xmath26 along each direction . for mathematical convenience , we define all values for @xmath27 as positive .",
    "the amplitude of a tight - binding mode , @xmath28 , with the associated phase factor described by the reciprocal - space wavevector , @xmath27 , is defined by : @xmath29 where @xmath11 runs over _ all _ atoms in the crystallographic unit cell , and @xmath14 runs over all unit cells contained within the ensemble .",
    "the vector , @xmath30 , points to the @xmath31 crystallographic unit cell in the ensemble .",
    "the values , @xmath32 , are the vectorial contribution of atom @xmath11 to the mode described by the ( @xmath33 ) pair .",
    "the vectorial contributions can span multiple atoms , as pertaining to the crystallographic multiplicity of the particular site in the original crystallographic unit cell .",
    "the index , @xmath34 , specifies each set of modes that together transform as an irreducible representation of the point group ; @xmath35 is equal to the dimensionality of the corresponding irreducible representation and runs over all modes in the set .",
    "together , there are @xmath36 distinct @xmath33 pairs , or tightly - binding modes , where @xmath37 is the number of atoms in the small , crystallographic cell .",
    "there is no index @xmath38 on @xmath39 , just like there is no wavevector dependence to atomic orbitals in the classic tight - binding electronic structure approach , because all wavevector dependences are explicitly included in the phase factors .",
    "further , note that to retain all degrees of freedom we allow the amplitudes of each tight - binding mode to be independent of all others , even if symmetry would constrain them ( i.e. , because one irreducible representation may be spanned by multiple modes ) .",
    "this allows for us to consider , but not enforce , symmetry in describing the `` large - box '' atomistic ensembles",
    ". stated differently , the projection is only a change of basis ; all @xmath40 degrees of freedom ( for an ensemble of @xmath37 atoms ) are retained ( omitting the 3 translational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom ) , and the exact atomistic ensemble can be reconstructed by the inverse of [ eqn : irrep ] :    @xmath41    this method , as applied to the toy model , is shown in figure  [ fig : transform](b ) .",
    "we note that this is distinct from typical crystallographic order parameter analysis @xcite , in which the constraints of the parent crystallographic symmetry are preserved and the primary interoperable variables are the order parameter amplitudes , thus providing one number for a pair of basis vectors that describe a displacement transforming as a two - dimensional irreducible representation , vs.  two numbers in our approach .",
    "we retain all possible degrees of freedom .",
    "when using our tight - binding modes , we can determine the activity of the mode and deviation of the ensemble from the crystallographic symmetry not just from the mode amplitude , but also from its mean - squared deviation ( msd ) from an ensemble operated on by a symmetry operation of the parent crystallographic space group .",
    "there are at least two distinct types of continuous symmetry measures ( as developed by d. avnir and coworkers @xcite ) that we characterize here .",
    "first , the global activity of a single tight - binding mode ( @xmath34 , consisting of one or more individual @xmath35 modes depending on the dimensionality of the corresponding irreducible representation ) can be quantified as the mean - squared deviation ( msd ) between the ( @xmath42 ) amplitudes and the new amplitude coefficients , @xmath43 , following application of a symmetry operation , @xmath44 , of the crystallographic space group : @xmath45 for purely symmetry - conserving displacements , the msd should be zero . here , it is critical to combine the squared amplitudes of all individual modes that together transform as a single multidimensional irreducible representation ( the innermost sums ) because the amplitude of individual modes can be varied simply by changing the choice of basis vectors within that mode set .",
    "the sum over all wavevectors is justified to identify local symmetry changes because it corresponds to summing up contributions derived from a single local tight - binding mode ( a la atomic orbital ) , and is exact in the molecular limit .",
    "the final square root is provided for convenience to make the magnitude of @xmath46 more physically interpretable .",
    "the related msd , not broken down by individual mode sets , is similarly simple to calculate : @xmath47 where again the final square root is provided for convenience .",
    "the second type of deviations from the parent space group that can be identified are distortions that do not retain an equivalence of mode amplitudes within a single mode set that transforms as a multidimensional irreducible representation . to illustrate this , consider a single box with @xmath18 symmetry and an atom in the center displaced along the diagonal direction ( figure  [ fig : schemeeuler ] ) .",
    "projected onto the two basis vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which together span the two - dimensional , @xmath50 , irreducible representation in the corresponding point group , the amplitudes along each basis are initially equal . as the euler angle that defines the absolute orientation of the basis vectors",
    "is varied , the intensity of @xmath49 reduces while @xmath48 rises until @xmath48 is collinear with the atom displacement ; this oscillatory pattern continues the rest of the way .",
    "note that the sum of the square amplitudes from the two contributions ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) is a constant ( this is required as the magnitude of the displacement is not changing ) .",
    "however , across multiple subcells or across multiple simulation runs , one can differentiate between random and ordered displacements .",
    "let @xmath51 be the initial angle of the displacement of the center atom .",
    "different @xmath51 s correspond to phase shifts of the values of @xmath52 ( and @xmath53 ) . if the @xmath51 s are completely random , then their average is a flat line as a function of euler angle , with variances that are also flat [ figure  [ fig : schemeeuler](b ) ] . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath51 s are pinned to specific directions , then only a subset of the phase shifts are present .",
    "this will often result in an average that is still flat as a function of euler angle , _",
    "e.g. _ , if they are pinned every 90@xmath54 , but the variances will no longer be uniform [ figure  [ fig : schemeeuler](c ) ] .",

    "<S> we use representational analysis to describe displacements of atoms in rmc ensembles from an ideal crystallographic structure in an approach analogous to tight - binding methods . rewriting the displacements in terms of a local basis that is descriptive of the ideal crystallographic symmetry </S>",
    "<S> provides a robust approach to characterizing medium - range order ( and disorder ) and symmetry breaking in complex and disordered crystalline materials . </S>",
    "<S> this method enables the extraction of statistically relevant displacement modes ( orientation , amplitude , and distribution ) of the crystalline disorder and provides directly meaningful information in a locally symmetry - adapted basis set that is most descriptive of the crystal chemistry and physics . </S>"
