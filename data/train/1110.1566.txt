    "the binding energy of saturated many - particle systems like a nucleus exhibits the hierarchy of expansion in powers of mass number @xmath5 which is associated with well - established experimental features and plays an important role in the understanding of macroscopic properties of nuclei @xcite . in a simplest case ,",
    "the surface energy @xmath6 of such systems is given by the term of order @xmath7 in this hierarchy .",
    "the structure of the surface energy @xmath8 and the corresponding surface tension coefficient @xmath9 depend on the interparticle interaction and the surface conditions .",
    "moreover , the nucleus is a two component , charged system with a finite diffuse layer .",
    "this fact specifies a number of various peculiarities of the nuclear surface energy @xmath10 : dependency on the density profile function , contribution to the surface symmetry energy , connection to the nuclear incompressibility , etc .",
    "the additional refinements of @xmath8 appear due to the quantum effects arising from the smallness of nucleus .",
    "in particular , the curved interface creates the curvature correction to @xmath8 of order @xmath11 and can play the appreciable role in small nuclei .    the curvature correction to the planar tension coefficient and the corresponding tolman length @xcite",

    "the importance of curvature term for the evaluation of nuclear masses and fission barriers and the interplay between different terms of the @xmath11-expansion due to the value of the radius was shown in @xcite .",
    "however the influence of the curved interface on the properties of small quantum systems is still poorly studied because of the finite diffuse layer where particle density drops down to the zero value .",
    "the presence of the finite diffuse layer in a small drop creates two , at least , questions : ( i ) what is the actual radius of a drop ? ( ii ) what is the physical surface where the surface tension is applied ?",
    "since the presence of the diffuse layer , different definitions for the size of the drop are possible @xcite which all give the value of the radius of spherical drop located within the diffuse layer .",
    "note that a small indefiniteness in a nuclear radius of the order of @xmath12  fm , i.e. , within the diffuse layer , leads to a shift of surface energy of order @xmath13 @xmath14 ( for @xmath15pb @xcite ) which exceeds significantly both the shell stru67 and the curvature @xcite corrections to the nuclear binding energy , see also ref .",
    "we point out also even though the width of diffuse layer is much less than the range of approximate uniformity of the particle density , one still needs the strict definition of the drop size because of the following reason .",
    "in contrast to the planar geometry , the area @xmath16  for the spherical ( curved ) surface will depend on the choice of drop radius and this will affect the value of the surface tension @xmath9derived from the surface energy .",
    "gibbs was the first who addressed the problem of the correct definition of the radius and the surface of tension to a small drop with a diffuse interface @xcite .",
    "after him , tolman drew attention @xcite that two different radii have to be introduced in this case : the equimolar radius @xmath0 , which gives the actual size of the corresponding sharp - surface droplet , and the  radius of tension @xmath1 ,  which derives , in particular , the capillary pressure , see below in sect .",

    "that the yield of fragments at the nuclear multifragmentation or the probability of clasterization of nuclei from the freeze - out volume in heavy ion collisions are derived by the statistical weight @xmath24 of the radius fluctuations @xcite @xmath25 in both above mentioned processes , the small nuclei occur necessarily and the exponential dependence of statistical weight @xmath24 on the surface tension @xmath26 should cause the sensitivity of both processes to the curvature correction @xmath27 .",
