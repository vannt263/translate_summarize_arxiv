    "as expected , the component @xmath133 is very small compared to the in - plane components .",
    "although the reason of such disagreement between the values of the anomalous resistivity given by @xmath107 and @xmath132 is not clear at the moment , we speculate that it might be due to the tensor nature of the effective resistivity , since we consider it as an scalar quantity in all our calculations . in such a way , the electric field might have contributions from all components of the current density , modifying their final values , especially for @xmath132 .",
    "[ fig : fluctuations_timeseries_bg3 ] also shows that , in general , @xmath132 tends to have more positive than negative values for later times , providing a net transport due to anomalous resistivity , but mostly in the in - plane directions .",
    "the other critical difference by comparing @xmath132 and @xmath107 is that the latter ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edamping_timeseries_bg3 ] ) has typical values larger by one order of magnitude .",
    "this fact illustrates that different methods to calculate anomalous resistivity based on ( the same ) time averages do not necessarily agree each other , a fact that has not been considered properly in previous works .",
    "this has to be taken into account when extrapolating conclusions based on this methods when applied to other scenarios with more significant anomalous resistivity .    in any case , these very small values due to correlated fluctuations are not enough to explain the deviations in the mean field generalized ohm s law or to contribute significantly to the mean electric field .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .  , who also found very small values of anomalous resistivity when performing a time average , in comparison with a calculation based on a spatial average .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluctuations_timeseries_bg3 ] the relative contributions from the first and third term to the total electric field @xmath132 in eq .  .",
    "in general , the electromagnetic contributions from the fluctuations of the magnetic field @xmath134 with the electron current @xmath135 are one order of magnitude smaller than the electrostatic ones ( @xmath136 ) for the in - plane components .",
    "this is to be expected , since the electromagnetic correlated fluctuations were shown to be smaller in low - plasma-@xmath137 conditions,@xcite like in our case with a strong guide field . in spite of this , we also find a significant contribution from the electromagnetic term for the @xmath65 component of the anomalous resistivity calculated from the correlated fluctuations , since @xmath138 is very small .",
    "all the calculations shown before rely on the choice of a given length for the time windows used for splitting mean from fluctuating quantities , being somewhat arbitrary to define the separation between both .",
    "the values of all quantities shown before will vary by changing this time windows .",
    "this is because , in a kinetic approach , the separation of scales introduced by the mean and fluctuating quantities is not unique .",
    "this is specially critical when there is no clear scale separation between average and fluctuating quantities in eq .  , making eq .   possibly invalid . as a consequence ,",
    "the quasi - collision term in the boltzmann equation do vary for different choices , affecting the macroscopic description .",
    "this fact was already considered since a long time ago@xcite ( see also ref .  ) and it continues being discussed nowadays when applied to in - situ measurements in the solar wind.@xcite for example , the same measurement process of electron distributions functions is by definition non - ergodic,@xcite therefore affecting any kind of calculations involving the macroscopic momenta of this quantity .        in all our previous calculations , we chose @xmath139 as a representative time average windows , since it is one of the smallest values where the fluctuations due to the noise are significantly smaller than the fluctuations of interest ( broadband up to the lower hybrid frequency ) . also , the mean and fluctuating quantities are not too sensitive to small changes around this value .",
    "[ fig : ohm_diff_convergence ] show the difference between the l.h.s and r.h.s . of the @xmath65component of the mean generalized ohm s law eq .",
    "( same quantity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ohm_diff](d ) ) , for the case @xmath70 and varying time windows over one order of magnitude . smaller time windows ( @xmath140 , fig .",
    "[ fig : ohm_diff_convergence](a ) ) are unreliable because they produce quantities with mostly fast fluctuations , in regions away from the current sheet , due to numerical noise and not due to relevant physical processes .",
    "larger time windows ( @xmath141 , fig .  [",
    "fig : ohm_diff_convergence](c)-(d ) ) smooth out small scale structures in the separatrices .",
    "we do not show even larger values of time windows , close to reconnection time scales , since they would produce unreliable results because the current sheet and the location of separatrices change location during the development of reconnection ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : e_anom_ddt_stack ] ) . a large time average would be meaningful under conditions of stationary reconnection , which would require a much larger simulation box and/or non - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ohm_diff_profile_convergence ] reveals complementary information to that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ohm_diff_convergence ] .",
    "note that , similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : ohm_diff_profile ] , we have also applied a spatial savitzky - golay filter .",
    "the peak values of the remaining term in the mean ohm s law are always at the low density separatrix , and decrease linearly for increasing time windows . on the other hand , and at the same time , the anomalous electric field becomes more comparable to the peak values of the pressure and inertia term contributions to the mean electric field when using larger time windows , since their maximum values decrease faster than in a linear fashion .",
    "this can also be understood in the sense that larger time windows take into account a broader spectrum of fluctuating frequencies , and then the relative contribution to the mean electric field should be larger than smaller time windows which only consider high frequencies not caused by streaming instabilities in the lower hybrid frequency range .            in order to see the time evolution of the correlated fluctuations , in fig .",
    "[ fig : anom_ez_timeseries_bg3](b ) we show the electric field due to this contribution @xmath142 . as expected , the peak values of this anomalous electric field do not contribute significantly to the mean electric field @xmath93 , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : anom_ez_timeseries_bg3](a ) , or to the non - ideal electric field in the l.h.s . of the mean ohm s law eq .",
    "( plot not shown here ) .",
    "the difference is about two orders of magnitude .",
    "those plots also confirm that larger time windows exhibit larger values of the anomalous resistivity , but in any case not varying significantly for later times , as well as more stable over large time periods and with a tendency toward positive values .",
    "this same behavior is also shown , but even in a more strongly manner , by the @xmath143 component of the anomalous resistivity due to correlated fluctuations in fig .",
    "[ fig : anom_ex_timeseries_bg3](a ) .",
    "note that all the values are enhanced in more than one order of magnitude compared to the @xmath65component .",
    "finally , we have also verified that the time average of all fluctuating quantities ( @xmath144 ) in the chosen range of time windows is close to zero , i.e. , the reynolds rules ( see , e.g. , appendix a2 in the textbook ref .  )",
    "are well satisfied ( plots not shown here ) .",
    "we investigated the consequences of the self - generated plasma - turbulence for the transport of the current - carrying charged particles in two - dimensional guide - field reconnection . in order to derive an `` anomalous '' effective resistivity due to the turbulence",
    ", we utilized a mean - field approach .",
    "for this sake we split - off the fast , micro - turbulent fluctuations from the mean , slowly varying variables quantities describing the macroscopic evolution of the plasma .",
    "we based our analysis on the results of fully kinetic 2.5d particle - in - cell ( pic ) code ( acronym ) simulations .",
    "based on those data , we first calculated the contributions to the balanced slowly varying ( mean ) electric field in the framework of a generalized ohm s law description .",
    "we then compared our findings first with the slowing - down rate of the macroscopic ( mean ) current and also by calculating the first order correlations of the micro - turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the latter method provides a collision term due to the fluctuations in the right hand side of a boltzmann equation for the mean quantities , derived from the vlasov equation for the fully kinetic variables .",
    "we found , by all the previous methods , that in two - dimensional collisionless guide - field reconnection , the self - generated kinetic - scale micro - turbulence does not significantly contribute to the balancing of the mean electric fields , neither near the reconnection x - line nor near the separatrices and the exhaust region of reconnection .    for strong external guide magnetic fields ( @xmath72 )",
    ", we found , however , that the self - generated turbulence near the `` low - density '' separatrices provides non - negligible contributions to the mean electric field .",
    "there , the energy exchange between the particles and the mean , averaged over the turbulence , electric fields , is `` patchy '' in space and oscillating in time due to the unstable plasma waves caused by a counterstreaming electron beam instability@xcite .",
    "part of the energy exchange is , however , irreversible and the corresponding slowly varying ( mean ) electric field can be related to be due to a `` anomalous '' resistivity produced by the turbulence    nevertheless , for most of the reconnection regions in guide fields in the range @xmath72 , the electron inertia dominates the slowly varying , macroscopic ( mean ) electric field . in the ohm s law , this contribution is dominant due to the large partial eulerian time - derivative of the mean electron bulk - drift velocity .",
    "note that only near the `` low density '' separatrices the inertia term is comparable to the pressure and the convective electric field terms . for smaller and vanishing guide fields @xmath145 , however , the contribution of the electron inertia to the mean electric field is negligibly small , not only near the reconnection x - line but also at the separatrices and in the exhaust region of reconnection .",
    "an independent estimate for the effective resistivity is the slowing - down rate of the mean velocity of the main current carriers , the electrons .",
    "the resulting `` anomalous '' resistive ( turbulent ) contribution to the electric field is spatially spread .",
    "it slightly differs from the results for the balanced mean electric field obtained by calculating the terms of the generalized ohm s law .",
    "however , the slowing - down rate of the mean electron current , associated to the electron - ion momentum transfer , is largest where the anomalous electric field via the calculation of the mean generalized ohm s law is strongest .",
    "the resulting slowing - down rate of the current , if attributed to an effective `` collision frequency '' , ranges from the ion - cyclotron to the lower - hybrid frequency .",
    "note that the electron inertia term is not directly proportional to the electron - current slowing - down rate .",
    "in addition to the out - of - plane electric field field @xmath68 , we further investigated the contribution of the self - generated turbulence to the electric field balance and energy transfer via the in - plane electric field components @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the momentum - exchange between the electron and ions in those directions appeared to be comparable to the one in the @xmath31 direction near the `` low density separatrices '' , i.e. , there the momentum transfer is isotropic .",
    "a large portion of the energy exchange is reversible and quasi - periodic as indicated by a changing sign of @xmath120 .",
    "a smaller part of the energy exchange corresponds to a net irreversible energy loss , i.e. , to dissipation .",
    "note that the latter should be detected with a time averaging window which is large enough to take into account the broad turbulence spectrum below the lower - hybrid frequency , generated by the beam instability of electrons flowing along the separatrix .",
    "we further verified the enhancement of the momentum transfer due to wave - particle interaction near the separatrices of strong - guide - field reconnection by another independent method , i.e. , calculating the first order correlations of field and plasma fluctuations .",
    "we found that for strong guide fields , the electric field balanced due to the quasi - collision term of the resulting boltzmann equation is negligibly small near the x - line of 2d reconnection .",
    "as obtained by the other methods , the contributions to the correlated field - plasma fluctuations are most important near the `` low density separatrices '' .",
    "the relevant fluctuations are mainly electrostatic with a characteristic frequency less than the lower - hybrid frequency .",
    "note that the contribution of the correlated fluctuations to the mean electric field is smaller and does not completely match the contributions obtained by the other two methods of determining the remaining term in the ohm s law and of calculating the rate of the slowing down of the electron current .",
    "this disagreement is , perhaps , due to the tensorial nature of the `` anomalous '' resistivity due to micro - turbulence which involves all vector components of the current density .",
    "further , we found the criterion for an appropriate choice of the sliding window width for the averaging procedure of the mean field approach . according to our results , one has to make sure that the window width has to include all the relevant frequency range of the turbulence for the anomalous transport , otherwise the result will be very sensitive on the chosen window - width .",
    "our findings provide a number of macroscopic signatures allowing a quantification of the wave - particle interaction and the momentum transfer due to micro - turbulence in antiparallel and in collisionless guide - field magnetic reconnection .",
    "in particular , we found that in guide - field magnetic reconnection , the self - generated turbulence is maximum near the separatrices rather than close to the x - line .",
    "our findings can be used , e.g. , for the diagnostics of in - situ measurements in magnetic reconnection regions in space and in laboratory experiments .",
    "since all such measurements are averaging over space and time , it is important to make sure which part of the turbulence is cut off , which may essentially contributes to the `` anomalous '' transport .",
    "this can be done by coordinated measurements of the mean quantities readily available , such as the ohm s law terms and the time derivatives of the mean electron current .",
    "such analysis became possible due to the availability of high resolution observations of fluctuations in space by the current mms mission and it would become possible in an even better way with the envisioned thor@xcite spacecraft mission .    while we found that in the limit of two - dimensional collisionless guide field reconnection the self - generated micro - turbulence does not significantly contribute to the mean , slowly varying electric field near the x - line , the situation will change if three - dimensional turbulence becomes relevant .",
    "our approach to obtain the turbulence - related contribution to the mean macroscopically observable electric field and the different terms of the generalized ohm s law will , however , still apply .",
    "this is particularly true if the kinetic turbulence is caused by plasma micro - instabilities which can only arise in three dimensions including the direction of the main current flow .",
    "then , it is expected that 3d turbulence will contribute more significantly to the `` anomalous '' transport terms in the generalized ohm s law .",
