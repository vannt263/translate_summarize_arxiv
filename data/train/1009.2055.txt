    "the purpose of this paper is to identify a combinatorial origin of the _ topological recursion formula _ of eynard and orantin @xcite as the operation of edge removal from a ribbon graph . as an application of our formalism",

    "* appendix  c ) .",
    "in moduli theory it often happens that we have two different notions of the _ volume _ of the moduli space .",
    "the volume may be defined by the push - forward measure of the canonical construction of the moduli space . or it may be defined as the symplectic volume with respect to the intrinsic symplectic structure of the moduli space .",
    "an example of such situations is the moduli space of flat @xmath1-bundles on a fixed riemann surface for a compact lie group @xmath1 @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the two definitions of the volume agree .",
    "the space we study in this paper is the combinatorial model of moduli space @xmath2 of smooth algebraic curves of genus @xmath3 with @xmath4 distinct marked points .",
    "it also has two different families of volumes parametrized by @xmath4 positive real parameters .",
    "one comes from the push - forward measure , and the other comes from the intrinsic symplectic structure depending on these parameters . and again these two notions of volume agree .",
    "the moduli space @xmath2 admits orbifold cell - decompositions parametrized by the collection of positive real numbers assigned to the marked points .",
    "this orbifold is identified as the space of ribbon graphs of a prescribed perimeter length , using the theory of strebel differentials . in his seminal paper of 1992 ,",
    "kontsevich @xcite calculated the symplectic volume of orbi - cells , and compared it with the standard euclidean volume .",
    "he found that the ratio was a constant depending only on the genus of the curve and the number of marked points .",
    "this constant plays a crucial role in his _ main identity _ , and hence in his proof of the witten conjecture .",
    "he wrote in appendix  c of @xcite that his proof of the evaluation of this constant `` presented here is _ not nice _ , but we do nt know any other proof . '' in this article we give another proof of the formula for the kontsevich constant , based on the topological recursion for ribbon graphs .    the idea of topological recursion has been used as an effective tool for calculating many quantities related to the moduli space @xmath2 and its deligne - mumford compactification @xmath5 .",
    "the quantities we can deal with include tautological intersection numbers and certain gromov - witten invariants .",
    "suppose we have a collection of quantities @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 subject to the _ stability _ condition @xmath9 , which guarantees the finiteness of the automorphism group of an element of @xmath2 . by an eynard - orantin type topological recursion formula",
    "@xcite we mean a particular inductive formula for @xmath6 with respect to the _ complexity _ @xmath10 of the form @xmath11 with linear operators @xmath12 and a bilinear operator @xmath13 , where the sum is taken for all possible partitions of @xmath3 and @xmath14 subject to the stability conditions @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we refer to section  [ sect : eo ] for more detail .",
    "there are many examples of such formulas .    1 .   the witten - kontsevich theory for the tautological cotangent class ( i.e.  the @xmath17-class ) intersection numbers @xmath18 on the moduli stack @xmath5 of stable algebraic curves of genus @xmath3 with @xmath4 distinct smooth marked points .",

    "the mirzakhani recursion formula for the weil - petersson volume of the moduli space of bordered hyperbolic surfaces with prescribed geodesic boundaries @xcite is a topological recursion .",
    "mixed intersection numbers @xmath19 of @xmath17-classes and the mumford - morita - miller @xmath20-classes satisfy a topological recursion , first found in @xcite for the case with @xmath21 and later generalized in @xcite .",
    "the expectation values of the product of resolvents of various matrix models satisfy a topological recursion ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the origin of the work @xcite .",
    "5 .   indeed ,",
    "the first three geometric theories turned out to be examples of the general theory @xcite of topological recursions @xcite , though geometric theories had been discovered earlier than the publication of @xcite . 6 .",
    "both open and closed gromov - witten invariants of an arbitrary toric calabi - yau threefold are expected to satisfy a topological recursion .",
    "this is the _ remodeling _ conjecture of @xcite .",
    "simple hurwitz numbers satisfy a topological recursion .",
    "it was first conjectured in @xcite based on a limit case of the remodeling conjecture , and was recently proved in @xcite .",
    "the simplest case of the remodeling conjecture for @xmath22 was proved in @xcite based on the laplace transform technique of @xcite .",
    "as shown below , the number of metric ribbon graphs with integer edge lengths for a prescribed boundary condition satisfies a topological recursion .",
    "our current paper provides an elementary approach to the idea of topological recursion that uniformly explains the combinatorial nature of the geometric examples ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) and ( 9 ) .",
    "the work of harer @xcite , mumford @xcite , strebel @xcite , thurston and others @xcite show that there is a topological orbifold isomorphism @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the space of metric ribbon graphs of genus @xmath3 and @xmath4 boundary components , and @xmath25 is the number of edges of a ribbon graph @xmath26 .",

    "note that we have the standard volume forms @xmath36 on @xmath37 and @xmath38 on @xmath39 .",
    "we can define the euclidean volume of the inverse image @xmath40 of @xmath41 using the push - forward measure by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath4-form on @xmath39 obtained by integrating the volume form on @xmath37 along the fiber @xmath44 .",
    "euclidean _ volume of the moduli space is defined by @xmath45 in appendix  c of @xcite , kontsevich proved the following .",
    "the ratio of the symplectic volume and the euclidean volume of @xmath46 is a constant depending only on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and its value is @xmath47    the euclidean volume of the polytope @xmath48 is a _ quasi - polynomial _ and is difficult to calculate in general .",
    "it is quite surprising that the ratio @xmath49 of the two functions is indeed a constant .",
    "although he says `` not nice , '' kontsevich s original proof is a beautiful application of homological algebra to the complexes defined by the incidence matrix @xmath50 .",
    "the new proof we present here uses an elementary argument on the topological recursion of ribbon graphs corresponding to the edge removal operation .",
    "we show that both @xmath51 and @xmath52 satisfy exactly the same induction formula based on @xmath10 , _ after taking the laplace transform_. we then calculate the initial condition for the recursion formula , i.e. , the cases for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and see that the equality holds .",
    "since the topological recursion uniquely determines the value for every @xmath55 subject to the stability condition @xmath9 , we conclude that @xmath56    here the appearance of the laplace transform is significant .",
    "the laplace transform plays a mysterious as well as a crucial role in each of the works @xcite . in the light of the eynard - orantin recursion formalism @xcite and the remodeling conjecture due to mario @xcite and bouchard - klamm - mario - pasquetti @xcite , we find that the laplace transform appearing in these contexts is the _ mirror map_. usually mirror symmetry is considered as a duality , and hence a family of fourier - mukai type transforms naturally appears @xcite . in our context , however , the nature of duality is not apparent .",
    "on one side of the story ( the a - model side ) we have a combinatorial structure .",
    "the mirror symmetry transforms this combinatorial structure into the world of complex analysis ( the b - model side ) . in the complex analysis side",
    "we have such objects as the residue calculus of @xcite and integrable nonlinear pdes such as the kdv equations @xcite , the kp hierarchy @xcite , frobenius manifold structures @xcite , the ablowitz - ladik hierarchy @xcite , and more general integrable systems considered in @xcite .",
    "the mathematical apparatus of the mirror map hidden in these structures is indeed the laplace transform .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : combinatorial ] we review ribbon graphs and combinatorial description of the moduli space @xmath2 that are necessary for our investigation .",
    "although the definition of the euclidean volume of @xmath46 is straightforward , it seems to be difficult to calculate it and there is no concrete formula .",
    "the approach we take in this paper is to appeal to the counting of _ lattice points _ of @xmath46 .",
    "thus section  [ sect : lattice ] is devoted to proving an effective topological recursion formula for the number of lattice points in the space of metric ribbon graphs with prescribed perimeters .",
    "our proof is based on counting ciliated ribbon graphs .",
    "once we find the number of lattice points in @xmath46 , we can obtain its volume by taking the limit as the mesh of the lattice tends to @xmath57 . to compare the number of lattice points and the volume , the simplest path is to take the laplace transform .",
    "thus we are led to calculating the laplace transform of the topological recursion for the number of lattice points in section  [ sect : ltintegral ] .",
    "after establishing the laplace transform formula , one can read off the information of the euclidean volume of @xmath46 as the leading terms of the laplace transform , by introducing the right coordinate system .",
    "this is carried out in section  [ sect : euc ] .",
    "the kontsevich symplectic form is defined in section  [ sect : symp ] , and the topological recursion for the symplectic volume due to @xcite is reviewed . with these preparations ,",
    "we give a new and simple proof of ( [ eq : intro - rho ] ) . in section  [",
    "sect : eo ] we explain the eynard - orantin formalism .",
    "this formalism is independent on the context and provides the same formula .",
    "we then convert our recursion formulas into this formalism , and observe how they all fit together in a single formula .",
    "this is the beauty and strength of the eynard - orantin formalism .",
    "we present a full detail of the calculations of the laplace transform in this paper , hoping it may lead to a deeper understanding of the eynard - orantin theory and the mirror map .",
    "appendix  [ app : ltproof ] is thus devoted to giving a proof of ( [ eq : ltrecursion ] ) and ( [ eq : ltsrecursion ] ) .",
    "these recursion formulas start with the initial values @xmath53 and @xmath58",
    ". the eynard - orantin theory also uses the unstable case @xmath59 .",

    "we refer to @xcite for precise definitions and more detailed exposition .",
    "a _ ribbon graph _ of topological type @xmath55 is the @xmath60-skeleton of a cell - decomposition of a closed oriented topological surface @xmath61 of genus @xmath3 that decomposes the surface into a disjoint union of @xmath62 @xmath57-cells , @xmath63 @xmath60-cells , and @xmath4 @xmath64-cells .",

    "an edge can form a loop .",
    "we denote by @xmath66 the cell - decomposed surface with @xmath26 its @xmath60-skeleton .",
    "alternatively , a ribbon graph can be defined as a graph with a cyclic order given to the incident half - edges at each vertex . by abuse of terminology",
    ", we call the boundary of a @xmath64-cell of @xmath66 a _ boundary _ of @xmath26 , and the @xmath64-cell itself as a _ face _ of @xmath26 .",
    "a _ metric _ ribbon graph is a ribbon graph with a positive real number ( the length ) assigned to each edge . for a given ribbon graph @xmath26 with @xmath67 edges ,",
    "the space of metric ribbon graphs is @xmath68 , where the automorphism group acts through permutations of edges ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  1 ) ) . we restrict ourselves to the case that @xmath69 fixes each @xmath64-cell of the cell - decomposition .",
    "if we also restrict that every vertex of a ribbon graph has degree ( i.e. , valence ) @xmath70 or more , then using the canonical holomorphic coordinate system of a topological surface ( * ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) and the strebel differentials @xcite , we obtain an isomorphism of topological orbifolds @xcite @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the orbifold consisting of metric ribbon graphs of a given topological type @xmath55 with degree @xmath70 or more .",
    "the degree condition is necessary to bound the number of edges @xmath25 for a given topological type @xmath55 .",
    "if we allow degree @xmath64 vertices , then there are infinitely many different ribbon graphs for every @xmath55 . by restricting to ribbon graphs of degree @xmath70 or more",
    ", we have the bound @xmath73 , which gives the dimension of each orbi - cell @xmath68 .",
    "the gluing of orbi - cells is done by making the length of a non - loop edge tend to @xmath57 .",
    "the space @xmath74 is a smooth orbifold ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath75 the natural projection via ( [ eq : m = rg ] ) , which is the assignment of the collection of perimeter length of each boundary to a given metric ribbon graph .",
    "take a ribbon graph @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath76 fixes every boundary component of @xmath26 , they can be labeled by @xmath77 . for a moment",
    "let us give a label to each edge of @xmath26 from an index set @xmath78 .",
    "the edge - face incidence matrix is defined by @xmath79_{i\\in n,\\;\\eta\\in e};\\\\ a_{i\\eta } & = \\text { the number of times edge $ \\eta$ appears in face $ i$}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath80 or @xmath64 , and the sum of entries in each column is always @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath26 contribution of the space @xmath81 of metric ribbon graphs with a prescribed perimeter @xmath82 is the orbifold polytope @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the collection of edge lengths of a metric ribbon graph @xmath26 .",
    "we have @xmath85    the canonical euclidean volume @xmath86 of the polytope @xmath87 is the ratio of the push - forward measure of the lebesgue measure on @xmath88 by @xmath50 and the lebesgue measure on @xmath39 at the point @xmath89 : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the @xmath4-form on @xmath39 obtained by integrating the volume form on @xmath92 along the fiber @xmath93 .",
    "this definition is equivalent to imposing @xmath94 for every open subset @xmath95 with compact closure .",
    "we define the _ euclidean volume function _ by @xmath96",
    "this is the euclidean volume of the moduli space @xmath2 considered as the orbi - cell complex @xmath97 with the prescribed perimeter length @xmath89 .",
    "only degree @xmath70 ( or trivalent ) graphs contribute to the volume function because they parametrize the top dimensional cells .",
    "since @xmath98 , we expect that the definition of the push - forward measure and the relation ( [ eq : volumeintegration ] ) imply that the volume function @xmath99 has the polynomial growth of order @xmath100 as @xmath101 .",
    "we will verify this growth order in section  [ sect : euc ] , ( [ eq : ltvolumeestimate2 ] ) .",
    "it is a difficult task to find a topological recursion formula for the euclidean volume functions @xmath99 directly from its definition",
    ". one might think that the weil - petersson volume of the moduli of bordered hyperbolic surfaces @xcite would give the euclidean volume at the long boundary limit , but actually the limit naturally converges to the _ symplectic volume _ we consider in section  [ sect : symp ] .",
    "the straightforward method for the euclidean volume is indeed to go through the detour of considering the lattice point counting .",
    "we therefore first derive a recursion formula for the number of metric ribbon graphs with integer edge lengths , take its laplace transform , and then extract the topological recursion for the euclidean volume functions .",
    "thus our main subject of this section is the set of all metric ribbon graphs @xmath102 whose edges have integer lengths .",
    "we call such a ribbon graph an _ integral ribbon graph_. following @xcite , let us define the weighted number @xmath103 of integral ribbon graphs with prescribed perimeter lengths @xmath104 : @xmath105 since the finite set @xmath106 is a collection of lattice points in the polytope @xmath107 with respect to the canonical integral structure @xmath108 of the real numbers , @xmath109 can be thought of as counting the number of _ lattice points _ in @xmath46 with a weight factor @xmath110 for each ribbon graph .",
    "the function @xmath109 is a symmetric function in @xmath111 because the summation runs over all ribbon graphs of topological type @xmath55 whose boundaries are labeled by the index set @xmath112 .    the function ( [ eq : ngn ] ) was first considered in @xcite .",
    "note that we do not allow the integer vector @xmath113 to have any @xmath57 entry , since each face of a ribbon graph must have a positive perimeter length .",
    "note that @xmath114 has no positive solutions .",
    "therefore , the natural extension of the definition ( [ eq : ngn ] ) to the case of @xmath115 would give @xmath116 .",
    "using the lattice point interpretation , it is easy to see that the relation between this function and the euclidean volume function is the same as that of the riemann sum and the riemann integral .",
    "let @xmath117 be a positive integer and @xmath95 an open domain with compact closure .",
    "then for every continuous function @xmath118 on @xmath119 , the definition of the riemann integration in terms of riemann sums gives @xmath120 this equality holds because our definition of the volume uses the push - forward measure .",
    "we note that as a function in @xmath121 there is no simple direct relation between the values @xmath109 and @xmath122 .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath123 if @xmath124 is odd because of ( [ eq : sump ] ) , but the volume function is not subject to such a relation .    to derive a topological recursion for @xmath109 , we introduce the notion of _",
    "ciliation_.    [ def : ciliation ]",
    "a _ ciliation _ is an assignment of a cilium in a face attached to a bordering edge .",
    "let @xmath125 be the length of the edge on which the ciliation is attached .",
    "we place the root of the cilium at a half - integer length away from the vertices bounding the edge .",
    "thus no cilium is attached to a vertex of a ribbon graph .",
    "the number of ciliations of a metric ribbon graph @xmath26 with integer edge lengths is given by ( [ eq : sump ] ) .",
    "indeed , if we count with respect to the edges , then there are @xmath126 ways for a ciliation to each edge because the cilium can be placed on each side of the edge . and each face @xmath127 has @xmath128 ways of ciliation .",
    "thus the total number of ciliations is @xmath129 .    for brevity of notation ,",
