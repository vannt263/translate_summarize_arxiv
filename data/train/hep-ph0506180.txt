    "the aim of this contribution is to compare whatever the best we have at hand for evaluation of the initial state radiation ( isr ) effect in the process @xmath4 using kkmc @xcite and phokhara @xcite monte carlo programs .",
    "the above investigation will be partly extended to the process @xmath5 .",
    "both kkmc and phokhara programs are full scale mc event generators , which can provide for any experimentally observable distribution .",
    "we concentrate however , on the distribution of the squared mass spectrum @xmath6 of the muon pair , because this distribution is relevant for the radiative return measurements of @xmath7 , and also because this particular distribution we may compare with the classical semi - analytical calculations . here we shall also exploit the analytical formulas of ref .  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which implement analytical second order isr calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite and third order leading - logarithmic ( ll ) isr calculation of refs .",
    "the isr formula of ref .",
    "@xcite is provided by the kksem facility of kkmc . in the actual kksem implementation",
    "we use version of the formula where numerically negligible ( at least at lep energies , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) second order nnll terms are neglected .",
    "it is important to stress from the very beginning that authors of phokhara and kkmc use different terminology to describe born level matrix element and higher order matrix element .",
    "i shall not try to unify terminology or fully explain the differences , referring the reader to original works , like refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "let me explain only very briefly the main differences .",
    "the kkmc authors define born as @xmath8 without any photon emission and the radiative return is necessarily the first order process with respect to such a born level .",
    "the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) corrections are of order @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the standard perturbative order , while mass logarithm @xmath11 is coming either from the virtual photon correction or the phase space integration over the real photon angle down to zero value .",
    "the nll and nnll corrections are of order @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspondingly . concerning mass terms ,",
    "they are routinely neglected in kkmc for the electron ( except those which integrate up to a finite correction ) while an effort is made to keep all of them for the final state fermions , at least at the born and the first order level .",
    "kkmc implements several variants of the qed matrix elements , which feature different level of higher order and mass term truncation .",
    "phokhara authors employ the leading - order ( lo ) as a name for the process in which one ( and only one ) photon is emitted in the final state .",
    "they name as the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) their matrix element with the one - loop corrections and the second real photon .",
    "this terminology may seem more adequate to discuss radiative return .",
    "however , when trying to match the two terminologies one has to pay attentions to the available phase space of the first real photon . depending on whether the minimum emission angle is imposed or not , one gets full factor @xmath14 or not , even at the lo .",
    "this affects strongly the relative magnitude of higher order corrections with respect to lo or ll . in this study",
    "we generally exclude from the considerations `` non - photonic '' corrections due to emission of additional lepton pair and vacuum polarization .    in fig.[fig:1",
    "] we compare results of kkmc and of phokhara using the best available isr matrix element in both programs at @xmath15gev .",
    "in kkmc we use second order matrix element with coherent exclusive exponentiation ( ceex ) described in refs .",
    "the second order ceex matrix element has complete next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) contributions and complete next - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) contributions .",
    "the magnitude of nll and nnll corrections was also examined in a separate studies , see contribution of s.  yost in these proceedings .",
    "kkmc includes most of the third order ll contributions by the virtue of exponentiation . on the other hand ,",
    "phokhara implements complete second order isr , including complete nll and nnll corrections ( i.e. singular corrections proportional to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which integrate to finite corrections of order @xmath18 , in the limit @xmath19 ) .",
    "phokhara does not resum ( exponentiate ) soft photon contributions to infinite order .",
    "it is worth to stress that the two mc calculation , kkmc and phokhara , and semianalytical formula of kksem of refs .",
    "@xcite represent set of _ three completely independent _ second order ( using terminology of kkmc ) calculation of the isr in every aspect of calculating qed matrix element and integrating the phase space .",
    "the main comparison of the isr calculations is shown in fig.[fig:1]a , where the distribution @xmath20 from kkmc and kksem agree very well , within 0.2% , except very low @xmath21 where they diverge by about 0.3%,gev subleading terms are , however , more important . ]",
    "while fig.[fig:1]a shows certain addition cross - check .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear .",
    "neglected nnll in kksem are a viable candidate , but to confirm this hypothesis one would need more tests . in the same plot we see that phokhara agrees well with kksem at low @xmath21 ( aligning with kksem ) and differs by about 0.25% in the central region ( we need higher statistics from phokhara to confirm this number ) from both kkmc and kksem and drops sharply at soft limit , high @xmath21 , because of lack of soft photon resummation . in order to understand quantitatively the effect of lack of exponentiation in phokhara we compare its result in fig.[fig:1]b with a variant of kksem in which we switch off exponentiation , i.e. all terms beyond second order are truncated .",
    "the smooth curve in fig.[fig:1]b representing result of this truncation fits very well phokhara result .",
    "in particular , looking into this result , one may think that the deviation of phokhara by 0.25% in the central region is related to its neglect of the third order ll .",
    "this conjecture needs more test to be confirmed .",
    "we summarize on the results of fig.[fig:1 ] that kkmc with the second order ceex matrix element , phokhara with its second order matrix element and kksem implementing second order analytical calculation agree very well , within the expected range and the pattern of the discrepancies seems to be understood .",
    "in kkmc there is another more primitive qed matrix element denoted as eex , see ref .",
    "@xcite for its full description , which follows closely the classical yennie - frautschi - suura ( yfs ) exponentiation scheme and its implementation is limited to first order plus second order ll . in the second order eex matrix element ( contrary to ceex )",
    "the nll corrections are incomplete .",
    "( on the other hand eex third order ll is complete , while in ceex it is incomplete . ) . for technical and historical reasons ,",
    "see discussion below , eex type matrix element is used for the production of low energy hadronic final states , for example for pion pair .",
    "it is , therefore , important to check how good it is compared to kkmc with more complete coherent exclusive exponentiation ( ceex ) matrix element .",
    "this is done for the muon final state in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "( ceex is not yet available for @xmath2-pairs ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a we see results from kkmc ceex and several variants of eex .",
    "we are actually plotting @xmath20 , dividing all results by kksem of ref .",
    "@xcite , the same as in previous fig.[fig:1 ] .",
    "the curves marked eex72 represent exponentiated eex matrix element based on complete first order , while eex73 and eex74 include also complete second and third ll , while ceex203 is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "as we see , at low @xmath21 , that is for the hard photon emission , results of eex matrix elements depart from other more complete results by up to 3% ! in the @xmath22 region it is different from the kksem , ceex kkmc by about 1% .",
    "the above result is also consistent with what we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "_ eex is therefore not well suited for the use in the high precision measurements of @xmath7 using radiative return below @xmath21=1gev .",
    "_ this result is not very much surprising , as eex of kkmc has incomplete second order nll . the observed effect at the low @xmath21 is a little bit bigger then what we expected .",
    "we have therefore done certain additional tests .",
    "we have split eex results into three components , @xmath23 , compared each of them with analytical result of table  i of ref .",
    "@xcite , also at @xmath24gev .",
    "we do not show results of these tests here , but the overall pattern of discrepancies seems to be consistent with nll class of corrections .",
    "this additional test indicates also that the main source of the problem is an approximate double real emission matrix element in eex and not the incomplete virtual corrections .",
    "in particular we have included in these tests the complete nll contribution in @xmath25 and @xmath25 .",
    "this did not help !",
    "the whole discrepancy seems to result from the use of the ll - approximate matrix element for the double real photon emission in eex .",
    "the above observation is consistent with the older tests in ref .",
    "@xcite at lep energies .",
    "+      let us not include fsr in the game , again for the muon pair final state .",
    "in fact , at low @xmath21 the rate of muon pair in radiative return is higher than of @xmath2 pairs , hence @xmath20 of muons can be used as a reference distribution for measuring @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore worth to test fsr in kkmc and to check result for @xmath20 once again . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b we show result from kkmc for second order ceex matrix element in which we include isr , fsr and its interference .",
    "we compare mc result with the semianalytical result of kksem in which with the same isr radiative function of ref .",
    "the fsr distribution of ref .",
    "@xcite features incomplete nll in kksem , so it is definitely inferior with respect to isr counterpart  the complete list of the fsr radiative corrections in kksem can be found in table  ii in ref .",
    "this above semianalytical formula also misses the interference of isr and fsr , which in first order is zero in the inclusive @xmath20 so this omission does not harm . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a we see the ratio of the corresponding results from kkmc and kksem .",
    "phokhara is able to provide result with fsr for muon pairs in the lo , and it would be interesting to include it in the comparison . )",
    "this result is rather preliminary and has to be checked . in any case , the agreement better than 1% found all over the @xmath26 range is quite satisfactory as a starting point for further investigation",
    "let us now switch to low @xmath21 @xmath2-pair state produced at the radiative return process . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we compare kkmc with the eex style matrix element on one hand with phokhara second order ( marked as phokhara2 ) on the other hand . the eex matrix element is the default one in kkmc , with first order exponentiation , the completed second and third order ll ( eex74 ) .",
    "we limit ourselves to isr only . the results of figs .",
    "[ fig:3]a - b are obtained without any cutoffs . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a we show the actual distributions , including also the distribution for the muon pairs .",
    "we see that for @xmath28 the muon - pair cross section is bigger than that of @xmath2-pair .",
    "the ratio phokhara / kkmc is not so well understood as the the analogous results for the muon pair shown in the previous section .",
    "the discrepancy at high @xmath21 we attribute to lack of exponentiation in phokhara . ] while another larger discrepancy at low @xmath21 is most likely due to incompleteness of second order nll in eex matrix element on kkmc , and it corresponds to deviation which was already seen in fig .  [ fig:2]a . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c - d we show the analogous results for relatively mild cut on photon momentum , where photon is defined as a `` missing four momentum '' calculated knowing pion momenta and beam momenta .",
    "we ask for the momentum of such a `` collective unseen photon '' to be directed below @xmath29 from the beam and to have at least @xmath30 of energy . for each @xmath2",
    "we require that it is situated in wide angles , eg .",
    "separated by more than @xmath31 from each beam .",
    "results in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c - d look quite similar , except that the discrepancy between phokhara and eex kkmc is bigger ( we need better statistics from phokhara to see it more clearly ) .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that the leading logarithm @xmath14 due to real emission is diminished by the cut on the photon angle with respect to beams .      in the following",
    "we show that the superior ceex isr matrix element can be extended to hadronic final states at low @xmath21 , like pion pair .",
    "this can be done provided we have some decent modeling of the hadronic final state in terms of the corresponding formfactor . in view of its practical importance ,",
