    "the computational evolution of 3-dimensional general relativistic space - times by means of cauchy evolution is a potentially powerful tool to study the gravitational radiation from black - hole / neutron - star binaries whose inspiral are expected to provide prominent signals to gravitational wave observatories .",
    "there are several 3-dimensional general relativistic codes under development to solve this problem .",
    "boundary conditions are an essential part of these codes . at the outer boundary they must provide an outgoing radiation condition and extract the emitted waveform . for black - hole spacetimes ,",
    "there is also an inner boundary , approximately given by the apparent horizon , where one excises the singular region inside a black hole .",
    "instabilities or inaccuracies introduced at such boundaries have emerged as a major problem common to all code development . historically , the first cauchy codes were based upon the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formulation  @xcite of the einstein equations .",
    "recently there has been pessimism that such codes might be inherently unstable because of the lack of manifest hyperbolicity in the underlying equations . in order to shed light on this issue",
    ", we present here a study of adm evolution - boundary algorithms in the simple environment of linearized gravity , where nonlinear sources of physical or numerical instability are absent and computing time is reduced by a factor of five by use of a linearized code .",
    "our two main results , for the case of fixed lapse and shift , are :    * on analytic grounds , adm boundary algorithms which supply values for all components of the metric ( or extrinsic curvature ) are inconsistent . *",
    "we present a boundary algorithm which allows free specification of the transverse - traceless components of the metric ( or extrinsic curvature ) at the boundary , and for which unconstrained , linearized adm evolution can be carried out in a bounded domain for thousands of crossing times with robust stability .",
    "the criteria for robust stability , which we present here , are the most severe that have been applied to cauchy evolution in numerical relativity .",
    "the boundary algorithm differs from previous approaches and offers fresh hope for robust nonlinear adm evolution .",
    "our particular motivation for this work is the difficulty we have experienced implementing cauchy - characteristic - matching ( ccm ) for 3-dimensional general relativity  @xcite .",
    "ccm provides a cauchy boundary condition by matching the cauchy evolution across the boundary to a characteristic evolution . for nonlinear scalar waves propagating in a flat 3-dimensional space",
    ", ccm has been demonstrated to be more accurate and efficient than all other existing boundary conditions for cauchy evolution  @xcite , and it has been demonstrated mathematically that this conclusion also applies to gravity  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the spherically symmetric case of a self gravitating scalar wave satisfying the einstein - klein - gordon equations , ccm has been successfully applied at the inner boundary of a cauchy evolution to excise the interior black hole region and , at the same time , at the outer boundary to provide a global evolution on a compactified grid extending to null infinity  @xcite .",
    "these successes are promising for the application of ccm to 3-dimensional problems in general relativity but this has not yet been borne out .",
    "this difficulty , and the similar difficulty in efforts using perturbative matching  @xcite , may possibly arise from a pathology of the cauchy boundary which is independent of matching . in this work ,",
    "we reveal such a pathology in the way boundary conditions have been applied in the adm formulation of the einstein equations which , at present , is the only formulation for which matching has been attempted .",
    "we also present a new form of adm boundary algorithm which eliminates the pathology .",
    "the stability of the cauchy evolution algorithm itself is straightforward to investigate by carrying out a boundary - free evolution on a 3-torus ( equivalent to periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "such tests constitute stage 1 of a 3-stage test bed for robust boundary stability which is summarized below and explained in detail in sections  [ sec : boun ] ,  [ sec : stage2 ] and  [ sec : stage3 ] .",
    "the periodic boundary tests serve to cull out algorithms whose boundary stability is doomed from the start . in earlier work , robust stability for characteristic evolution with random data on an inner boundary was demonstrated for characteristic evolution using the pitt null code  @xcite .",
    "in the course of the present investigation we have reconfirmed this robustness of the pitt code using the same specifications proposed here for cauchy codes .",
    "ccm can not work unless the cauchy code , as well as the characteristic code , has a robustly stable boundary .",
    "this is necessarily so because the interpolations between a cartesian cauchy grid and a spherical null grid continually introduce short wavelength noise into the neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "this is the rationale underlying the robustness criterion in our test bed .",
    "robustness of the cauchy boundary is a necessary ( although not a sufficient ) condition for the successful implementation of ccm .    analytic studies of cauchy evolution of linearized gravity with boundaries at infinity reveal modes which grow linearly in time , but none which grow exponentially  @xcite .",
    "the inaccuracy introduced by such secular modes can be controlled and is not of major concern , at least in the linearized theory .",
    "( such secular modes can lead to exponential instabilities of numerical origin in the nonlinear theory if not properly treated  @xcite ) . in the case of a finite boundary ,",
    "there is further potential for instability and a brief discussion is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : boun ] .",
    "as is customary in numerical relativity , we monitor the existence of unstable modes by the growth of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "because the constraints are not enforced during standard implementation of adm evolution , the hamiltonian constraint is an effective sensor of numerical instabilities .",
    "stage 2 of the test bed is based on the simple boundary value problem obtained by opening one dimension of a 3-torus to form a 2-torus with plane boundaries normal to a cartesian axis . running a cauchy - boundary algorithm with this topology and with random initial and random boundary data forms the second stage of our test bed , which is discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : st2bc ] , we present new evolution - boundary algorithms which are robustly stable .",
    "stage 3 of the testbed is designed to test robustness of boundary conditions appropriate to an isolated system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stage3 ] we establish stage 3 robustness of an adm boundary algorithm .",
    "the main results presented here are experimental , in a computational sense .",
    "the difficulties encountered with finite cauchy boundaries in general relativity have recently prompted some analytic investigations of the subject  @xcite .",
    "however , these have so far been confined to hyperbolic formulations , as opposed to the adm formulation , and to the analytic problem , as opposed to the finite difference solution obtained by computation . although it is not possible to make a direct comparison , the nature of our results are consistent with the general conclusions of these analytic studies .",
    "there are several promising numerical approaches based upon hyperbolic ( or `` more hyperbolic '' ) formulations of the equations  @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate on adm schemes , which are the most compact to code and require the least amount of memory because they have a smaller number of variables .",
    "our results should provide useful benchmarks for other relativity codes .",
    "however , it should also be cautioned that the nature of a successful boundary algorithm is dependent on the form of the equations adopted , as well as the choice of discretization , and the adm boundary algorithms we have obtained do not necessarily apply to other formulations .",

    "the two components @xmath148 are treated as free data ( i.e. are specified randomly ) on all faces , edges and corners .",
    "while this means two free quantities and four update equations on the faces , there are four free quantities on the edges so that one only needs two update equations .",
    "furthermore , at any corner , the six @xmath139 components from the neighboring faces , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 , are reduced to five that are independent and therefore freely specifiable by means of the identity @xmath155 + [ k_{yy}-k_{zz } ] + [ k_{zz}-k_{xx } ] = 0 $ ] .",

    "the diagonal components of @xmath109 are computed the same way as on the corners .",

    "otherwise , in the case of the @xmath114 face , when computing the quantity @xmath165 on the top time - level , with centered finite differencing , one might use values of @xmath151 on the edge parallel to the @xmath161-axis that were not yet updated .",
    "we confirmed that * the above algorithm is robustly stable * by performing runs with @xmath166 and random initial and boundary data .",
    "the behavior of the hamiltonian constraint as a function of time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stage3 ] .",
    "we have shown that linearized adm evolution with boundaries can be carried out with long term stability in a test bed consisting of random constraint violating initial data and random boundary data applied to the trace - free - transverse metric . adding the hamiltonian constraint ( with @xmath167 ) to the ricci system of linearized equations appears to give better performance , but does not drastically affect overall robustness .",
    "the successful implementation of an adm boundary algorithm presented here offers new hope both for the long term stability of nonlinear adm evolution and for the prospects of matching an exterior solution at an adm boundary .",
    "however , this optimism should be tempered with the following caveats .",
    "although we have tested our algorithm only for the case of unit lapse and zero shift , the extension to any explicitly assigned values of the lapse and shift appears to be straightforward , at least in the linearized theory .",
    "however , the use of dynamical gauge conditions , which couple the values of lapse and shift to the metric , would require case - by - case reconsideration .",
    "a spherical boundary would be necessary for an application of our algorithms to ccm , the implementation of a spherical boundary algorithm is simple in principle .",
    "only the @xmath138 metric ( or extrinsic curvature ) components should be matched at the boundary , with the the remaining components updated using the evolution equations .",
    "the identification of the @xmath138 components can be readily made in the local tangent space of the boundary .",
    "however , a preliminary investigation reveals nontrivial technical problems arising from the non - alignment of a spherical boundary with the cartesian grid .",
    "@xcite .",
    "results for the linear theory are important for ruling out approaches that can not work in the nonlinear case .",
    "however , the real value of our robust boundary algorithms will depend upon whether they can successfully be applied to the nonlinear adm equations . for * ba1",
    "* , the best performing boundary algorithm , the formal implementation appears to be straightforward ( when the lapse and shift are given explicitly ) .",
    "it is standard practice in numerical evolution to choose the boundary to follow the evolution , so that the grid is propagated up the boundary , this allows straightforward identification of the @xmath138 components of the metric and extrinsic curvature .",
    "an examination of the nonlinear equations used in the boundary algorithm shows that second derivatives do not appear in any essentially new way that would alter the finite difference stencils .",
    "nonlinear terms with first time derivatives which appear in the boundary update scheme can be evaluated either by means of iterative techniques or in terms of previously known time levels by backwards differencing .",
    "a separate and more problematic issue is the stability of such an implementation . at the very least",
    ", stability in the nonlinear case would require suppressing the secular modes of the linear theory from becoming exponential  @xcite .",
    "preliminary work underway  @xcite to incorporate our boundary algorithms in a nonlinear adm code shows improved performance in the weak field regime over applying boundary conditions to all components of the metric , but it is premature to judge robust nonlinear stability . our results for the linearized equations could not have been obtained without substantial computational experimentation and the same certainly holds for their extension to the nonlinear case .",
