    "then results in a local smearing of the initial wave function over the narrow set of new eigenstates , given by the function @xmath57 , so that ` microcanonical thermalization ' can be expected  @xcite .",

    "this next class of hamiltonians refers to quantum systems possessing a finite number of interacting particles or spins , as realized with fermionic  @xcite and bosonic hubbard models  @xcite . in the limit @xmath106",

    "synthesized hamiltonians , although very useful for numerical studies  @xcite , have a serious drawback .",
    "namely , they do not feature some nontrivial statistical properties which may be present in spectra of actual quantum systems .",
    "therefore the equipartition scenario needs to be tested with a realistic physical hamiltonian .    as a last peer model we use a finite cluster of @xmath118",

    "in conclusion , using different classes of hamiltonians , we have unraveled the mechanism responsible for the thermal equilibration of two identical quantum peers prepared initially in canonical states at different temperatures .",
    "this mechanism , i.e. , the equipartition within energy shells in the hilbert space of the composite system , may appear whenever the interaction is small enough to satisfy the weak - coupling condition , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : weak coupling ] , [ eq : not - to - weak coupling ] ) . however , the equipartition scenario is not universal : quantum systems that exhibit anderson localization are expected to invalidate the equipartition scenario when coupled by a weak local interaction , and the final equilibrium states of the corresponding peers can differ substantially from being thermal - like  @xcite",
    ".    one should keep in mind that the time evolution of any isolated quantum system with a finite number of levels has a finite recurrence time , which depends on the system spectrum and the system initial conditions .",
    "thus the equilibration of the peers to a thermal ` equilibrium ' after some interaction time @xmath169 does not contradict the disappearance of the equilibration at some larger times , @xmath170 , due to revivals .",

    "it means that initial states different from thermal gibbs states , generally would lead to a final quasi - equilibrium which may not be thermal - like anymore .",
    "this complication , however , could be weakened by the increase of the number of peers : interaction between @xmath173 systems would effectively mimic an environment for a single peer , thus leading to the mutual equilibration of all peers to nearly identical thermal states regardless the shape of their initial eigenstate distributions  @xcite .                                    in a mathematical sense",
    ", there is no unidirectional relaxation towards a strict stationary state in a closed quantum system . for any finite quantum system with a discrete energy spectrum , the evolution of any observable is quasiperiodic , and , therefore",
    ", recurrences are inevitable , see in ref . [",
    "however , when the dimension of the system hilbert space is sufficiently large , the recurrences occur on time scales which are much longer than any time scale of practical relevance [ 11 ] .",
    "in addition , each cluster has also a mirror symmetry so that the corresponding hilbert space is shared by symmetric and antisymmetric eigenstates .",
    "however , in the context of mutual thermalization this parity can be safely left without paying further attention to it ."
