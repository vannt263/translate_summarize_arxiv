    "at a redshift of 0.902 @xcite , nrao530 ( also known as b1730 - 130 ) is a well - known blazar , which is classified as an optically violent variable object .",
    "strong and erratic broad - band variability has been observed in the radio @xcite , optical  @xcite , and the @xmath2-ray regime  @xcite . in @xmath2-rays , it appeared as a relatively quiescent source after the launch of @xmath3  @xcite , but started to flare from the end of 2010 october  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , serendipitously detected a short hard x - ray flare on 2004 february 17 with the @xmath4 satellite .",
    "on kpc scales , nrao530 exhibits two - sided lobes in the east - west direction .",
    "the western lobe is stronger than the eastern one and is connected to the core with weak arch - structured emission  @xcite .",
    "centimetre very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) images showed a core - jet structure on pc scales with an oscillating trajectory extending to the north from the assumed core ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "space vlbi observations revealed brightness temperatures of nrao530 significantly in excess of both , the inverse compton and the equipartition limit @xcite .",
    "superluminal motion of several jet components is detected with apparent velocities in the range of 1040@xmath5 .",
    "images of nrao530 obtained at 5ghz in the early 1990s indicated that the position angle ( pa ) of the jet components changed significantly . our new images in 2007",
    "reveal a jet structure for the inner region very different from those previously reported .",
    "nrao530 has undergone two moderate flares @xcite since the dramatic flare around 1997 .",
    "this stimulates us to also investigate the pc - scale jet kinematics and its possible relation to the long - term radio flux variations in nrao530 .",
    "following a brief explanation of the observations and data reduction in section  [ sec:2 ] , we present in section  [ sec:3 ] the results from very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations at three frequencies ( 22 , 43 and 86ghz ) .",
    "the structure of the inner jet was found to have changed significantly when compared with previous vlbi studies . in order to better understand the jet kinematics ,",
    "we therefore have made use of vlba data at2 cm ( 15ghz ) , from the monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba experiments ( mojave ) programme , which allows us to conduct a detailed study of structural variations with good time coverage .",
    "we briefly discuss in section  [ sec:4 ] the implications for our understanding of jet morphology and kinematics .",
    "a summary of the results is presented in section  [ sec:5 ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the luminosity distance to nrao530 @xmath6 = 5.8gpc , 1mas of angular separation corresponding to 7.8pc , and a proper motion of 1mas yr@xmath7 corresponding to a speed of @xmath8 = 48.5c ( @xmath9 = 71kms@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "during the global campaign on sgra * in 2007 may , nrao530 was monitored as a calibrator with the vlba from 2007 may 15 to 24 ( 2007.3702007.395 ) at 22 , 43 and 86ghz every day .",
    "nrao530 was observed as a fringe finder and was used to check the amplitude calibration of sgra *  .",
    "nrao530 was observed shortly before , during , and after the time of visibility of the target source , sgra*. dual circular polarization at a recording rate of 512 mbps [ 8 intermediate frequency ( if ) channels , 16 mhz per if , and 2 bits per sample ] was recorded at each station .",
    "the individual vlbi scans on nrao530 had a duration of 3min at 22ghz and 4min at 43 and 86ghz , respectively .",
    "five scans at each frequency were observed , resulting in a total time on source of @xmath12 15min at 22ghz and @xmath12 20min at 43 and 86ghz , respectively .",
    "an example of the _ uv _ coverage at 22ghz is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv_plt ] .",
    "the data analysis was performed within the aips software in the usual manner .",
    "opacity corrections were made at all three frequencies by solving for receiver temperature and zenith opacity for each antenna .",
    "in addition , we have also used the vlba observations at 15ghz from the `` 2 cm survey '' and the follow up mojaveprogram between 1999 and 2009 , spanning 10 years .",
    "these data were provided as automatically self - calibrated _ uv _ fits file , which we re - do the mapping and self - calibration in difmap before model - fitting .        in all cases of the model fitting ,",
    "circular gaussian components have been chosen in order to simplify and unify the comparison .",
    "the final fitting of the jet components was stopped when no significant improvement of the reduced @xmath13 values was obtained .",
    "the formal errors of the fit parameters were estimated by using the formalisms described in @xcite .",
    "the position errors were estimated by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the post - fit rms , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the size and the peak intensity of the component . in case of very compact components",
    ", this tends to underestimate the measurement error .",
    "we therefore included an additional minimum error criterion according to the map grid size , which roughly matches one - fifth of the beam size at each frequency and corresponds to 0.06mas at 15 and 22ghz , 0.03mas at 43ghz , and 0.02mas at 86ghz .",
    "for the weighted mean of parameters from the 10 consecutive epochs , we have chosen the max @xmath18 as the standard error for the few cases when the former is smaller than the latter , with @xmath19 being the standard deviation . by doing so",
    ", we have assumed stationarity of the corresponding parameter on a daily time - scale .",
    "for the spectral analysis , we estimate absolute flux - density calibration errors of 3 - 5 per cent at 22 and 43ghz and 20 per cent at 86ghz .",
    "our 10-d observations have revealed a consistent jet structure at all three frequencies .",
    "cross - identification of jet components is straightforward and unambiguous .",
    "the components seen at 15ghz were cross - identified based on their flux density evolution , core separation , pa , and full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "we noted that although the archival data at 15ghz have a good time resolution , large time gaps between 2000 and 2002 pose some difficulties in tracing the weak jet components ( see section  [ sec:3.4 ] ) .",
    "+    in fig .  [ fig : maps2007 ] , we show as an example one of the resulting clean maps of nrao530 at 15ghz at epoch 2007 june 10 ( 2007.441 ) and at 22 , 43 , and 86ghz at epoch 2007 may 15 ( 2007.370 ) .",
    "maps for all epochs at all frequencies are included as supporting information in the online version of this paper ( figs  [ fig : maps2007_online ] and [ fig : u_online ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : para_n ] lists the map parameters and table  [ tab : nrao530_model ] summarizes the epoch of observation , the identification of components , and the model fit parameters and their uncertainties ( all errors are 1 @xmath19 throughout ) of the maps shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : maps2007 ] ( only a small portion of each table is shown here ; the full tables are available online in tables  [ tab : para_n_online ] and [ tab : nrao530_model_online ]  see supporting information ) . on 2007",
    "may 15 ( 2007.370 ) , the sparse _ uv _ coverage at 86ghz did not permit us to model the source structure by more than a single gaussian component , and we will not consider this data set for further analysis ."
