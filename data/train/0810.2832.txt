    "the reaction @xmath2 is of considerable importance in atmospheric , combustion and interstellar chemistry . in the upper stratosphere and lower",
    "mesosphere , it plays a major role in partitioning the relative abundance of oh and ho@xmath1 molecules  @xcite .",
    "the reaction also plays a key role in the night - time airglow emissions from the hydroxyl radical which has also been recently detected in the atmosphere of venus  @xcite .",
    "it has been identified as a key reaction in interstellar oxygen chemistry  @xcite and it is considered to be the most important source of oxygen molecules in cold interstellar clouds  @xcite . as a consequence , the ho@xmath1 system has been the topic of numerous electronic structure calculations of its potential energy surface  @xcite as well as dynamics calculations to evaluate its temperature dependent rate coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the reaction has also been the focus of a large number of experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "however , there still remains significant discrepancy between measured and computed values of its rate coefficients for temperatures below 200  k , which is the most important region for astrophysical and upper atmospheric applications .",
    "recently , carty et al .",
    "@xcite reported an experimental measurement of rate coefficients for the reaction in the temperature range 39  k to 142  k and observed no variation in the rate coefficients with temperature in this regime . based on their findings they concluded that the rate coefficient would largely remain constant between 39  k to 10  k , temperatures typical of cold interstellar clouds . in contrast to the experimental results of carty et al .",
    ", in a recent theoretical work using a time - independent quantum mechanical ( tiqm ) method and a @xmath3-shifting approximation , xu et al .",
    "@xcite reported a rate coefficient that precipitously dropped by about two orders of magnitude between 39  k and 10  k. using a time - dependent wave packet ( tdwp ) method that does not employ the @xmath3-shifting approximation , lin et al .",
    "@xcite reported a rate coefficient at 10  k that is about one order of magnitude smaller than that obtained by carty et al . at 39  k. in a subsequent study , quan et al .",
    "@xcite adopted these rate coefficients for modeling molecular oxygen chemistry in the interstellar medium .    in this paper , using an accurate tiqm method and two different representations of the electronic ground state of the ho@xmath1 system , we show that the low temperature rate coefficient of the o + oh reaction is very sensitive to the dense resonance structures in the energy dependence of its reaction probability . by using a very fine grid of collision energies in the low and ultralow regime to compute the reaction probabilities ,",
    "we obtain nearly temperature independent values of the reaction rate coefficients in the range 10  39  k , in agreement with the conclusions of carty et al .",
    "our results differ from those of xu et al .",
    "@xcite which show rapid decrease below 40 k. however , our results do merge with those of xu et al . at temperatures above 300  k where the low energy regime does not make a significant contribution .",
    "we believe that the rate coefficient reported here would provide a more accurate value for modeling oxygen chemistry in the interstellar medium .    a brief description of the computational method is provided in section ii followed by results and discussion in section iii .",
    "conclusions are presented in section iv .",
    "the calculations have been performed using the adiabatically adjusting principal - axis hyperspherical ( aph ) approach of pack and parker  @xcite . in the present work , we employed two representations of the electronic ground state @xmath4 of the ho@xmath1 system .",
    "we used the xxzlg pes calculated by xu , xie , zhang , lin , and guo  @xcite which was also employed in the study of xu et al .",
    "@xcite . for the other surface",
    ", we used the diatomics - in - molecule ( dim ) pes developed by kendrick and pack  @xcite , hereafter referred to as the dimkp pes . for each value of the total angular momentum quantum number , @xmath3 , and each value of the hyperspherical radius , @xmath5",
    ", the wavefunction is expanded onto a basis set of adiabatic functions , which are eigenfunctions of a triatomic hyperangular hamiltonian .",
    "the hyperangular hamiltonian is diagonalized using an implicitly restarted lanczos algorithm and a hybrid dvr / fbr primitive basis set  @xcite .",
    "the time - independent schrdinger equation yields a set of differential close - coupling equations in @xmath5 , which is solved using the log - derivative matrix propagation method of johnson  @xcite .",
    "the log - derivative matrix is propagated to a matching distance where asymptotic boundary conditions are applied to evaluate the reactance matrix , @xmath6 , and the scattering matrix , @xmath7 .",
    "the square elements of the @xmath7 matrix provide the state - to - state transition probabilities , @xmath8 .",
    "the matching distance @xmath9 and the number of adiabatic functions @xmath10 used in the basis set are determined by optimization and extensive convergence studies .",
    "the convergence of the @xmath11 reaction probability @xmath12 for the o + oh@xmath13 reaction with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath10 is summarized in table  [ tab1 ] for the dimkp pes and table  [ tab2 ] for the xxzlg pes .",
    "based on these convergence studies , we have used @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the final production calculations .    .",
    "@xmath11 reaction probability of o + oh@xmath13 @xmath0 h + o@xmath1 for the dimkp pes for different values of the matching distance @xmath9 and the number of hyperspherical channels @xmath10 at different collision energies @xmath16 .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we have performed quantum dynamics of the o + oh @xmath0 h + o@xmath1 reaction over a wide range of collision energies on two recent pess using a time - independent quantum formalism based on hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "we report total and product vibrational state - selected reaction probabilities , and initial state - selected rate coefficients for the reaction .",
    "special attention has been devoted to the convergence of the rate coefficients with respect to the energy resolution of reaction probabilities and the inclusion of the ultralow energy regime .",
    "the computed rate coefficients are in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements and existing recommended values , despite using a @xmath3-shifting approximation for the evaluation of the rate coefficients .",
    "our calculations show that omission of the low energy regime or insufficient energy resolution of the reaction probabilities can lead to significant errors in the computed rate coefficients .",
    "the rate coefficient at 10 k differ by a factor of 2 - 3 between calculations using a finer energy grid and a sparse energy grid .",
    "therefore , we expect that a careful choice of the energy grid will also be important for an accurate evaluation of the rate coefficients without the @xmath3-shifting approximation .",
    "overall , results on the xxzlg pes are in better agreement with the experimental results of carty et al .  @xcite compared to the dimkp pes in the temperature range of 39@xmath17142  k. however , only two data points are available from measurements in this temperature range and experimental error bars are also quite large . for both pess ,",
    "the rate coefficients decrease only slightly as the temperature is decreased from 39  k to 10  k , in agreement with the conclusions of carty et al . based on the present results we believe that a re - evaluation of the importance of the o + oh reaction on o@xmath1 abundance would be required for describing oxygen chemistry in the interstellar medium .",
