    "in the past decade the asymptotic safety scenario of quantum gravity @xcite has been explored in quite some detail .",
    "evidence for a non - trivial uv fixed point ( fp ) has been collected with various methods , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "renormalisation group ( rg ) approaches to quantum gravity are naturally well - suited to study such a scenario . in its modern functional form",
    "the renormalisation group is by now very - well developed with many results in various physics areas , for reviews on gravity and gauge theories see e.g.@xcite . since the early works on the functional rg ( frg ) @xcite , which were carried out within the einstein - hilbert approximation , our understanding of the underlying physics has been extended tremendously , for reviews see e.g. @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the stability of the fixed point scenario has been tested far beyond the original einstein - hilbert truncation .",
    "these extensions include effects generated by the weyl tensor as well by general terms in the curvature scalar , e.g.  @xcite , higher order derivative terms , e.g.  @xcite , ghost fluctuations , e.g.@xcite , first attempts on lorenzian gravity , e.g.   @xcite , as well as the coupling to matter and gauge fields , e.g.@xcite .",
    "the impressive plethora of results , including those obtained in other approaches , @xcite , give us a firm grip on the asymptotic safety scenario in quantum gravity .",
    "this allows us to study interesting physics related to cosmology and the dynamics of the full matter - gravity system .",
    "still , all approaches to quantum gravity have to face the non - trivial task of implementing full diffeomorphism invariance and reparameterisation invariance of the theory .",
    "this task is tightly linked to the question of background independence of quantum gravity which is also not fully resolved yet .    in the present work diffeomorphism invariance and background independence",
    "are discussed within the functional rg approach to gravity .",
    "this approach is based on the standard background field approach to quantum field theory , in which the theory is expanded about a specific background field configuration . in gravity",
    "this is usually realised within a linear splitting of the full metric @xmath0 in a background metric @xmath1 and a fluctuation @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the background is identified with the dynamical metric by setting @xmath3 , which removes the background field dependence , see e.g.@xcite . in this approach",
    "the effective action is invariant under symmetry transformations of the background field configuration . at its root",
    "this is only an auxiliary symmetry whereas the dynamical symmetry transformations of the fluctuations are non - trivially realised .",
    "note , however , that the fluctuation field @xmath4 in such an approach has no geometrical meaning , i.e.  in gravity @xmath4 is no metric , and in the simpler example of a yang - mills theory the fluctuation field is no connection .",
    "moreover , the symmetry identities of the fluctuation fields lead to non - linear relations between fluctuation field green functions .",
    "it is also possible to derive identities that link background field green functions and fluctuation field green functions , the nielsen identities @xcite .",
    "the nielsen identity in combination with the gauge / diffeomorphism covariance of the background field green functions provide the non - trivial symmetry identities of the fluctuation field . in summary",
    "these relations are chiefly important for the discussion of diffeomorphism invariance as well as background independence in quantum gravity , and are at the root of the interpretation of the background correlation functions as s - matrix elements .    in the present work we put forward a fully diffeomorphism - invariant frg approach to quantum gravity , @xcite , by using the geometrical or vilkovisky - dewitt effective action , e.g.@xcite .",
    "our construction can be understood as a non - linear upgrade of the standard background field approach , its linear order giving precisely the background field relations in the landau - dewitt gauge .",
    "the gain of such a non - linear approach is that the fluctuation fields have a geometrical meaning and can be utilised to compute an effective action which only depends on the diffeomorphism - invariant part of the fluctuation fields .",
    "consequently , the geometrical effective action is trivially diffeomorphism - invariant , and any cutoff procedure applied to these fluctuation fields maintains diffeomorphism invariance . still , fluctuation field green functions and background metric green functions are related to each other by means of a regulator - dependent nielsen identity @xcite .    within this framework",
    ", we provide the first fully diffeomorphism - invariant evaluation of the phase diagram of quantum gravity including the infrared sector of the theory .",
    "our approach also allows for a more direct access to the question of background independence . in a first non - trivial approximation",
    "the present work provides further evidence for the asymptotic safety scenario of quantum gravity .",
    "we also unravel an interesting infrared fixed point structure .    in section",
    "[ sec : geo ] we briefly recapitulate the geometrical approach to quantum gravity . its frg version as formulated in @xcite is introduced in section  [ sec : geometricalflow ] . in section",
    "[ sec : approximation ] we define the approximation which captures the difference between background metric dependence and fluctuation metric dependence . in section  [ sec : nielsen ] the nielsen identity for the regularised geometrical effective action , @xcite , is used to derive relations between different terms in the effective action . in section  [ sec : backgroundflow ] we compute the uv fixed point within the geometrical approach in the einstein - hilbert truncation without the nielsen identity . in section",
    "[ sec : dynflow ] we utilise the nielsen identity to derive both the flow of the background couplings as well as that of the dynamical couplings .",
    "results on the uv fixed point scenario within the geometrical approach in the standard background approximation are presented in section  [ sec : geobackresults ] . in four space - time dimensions they agree with that obtained in the standard background field approach within the same background approximation , and in landau - dewitt gauge . in section  [ sec : geoflucresults ] we present the results for the phase diagram of quantum gravity within the fully dynamical approach .",
    "the uv - fixed point scenario agrees qualitatively with that found in the background field approximation , and compares well with that found in the bi - metric background field approach put forward in @xcite , see section  [ subsec : uv ] .",
    "we also find a stable infrared fixed point , see section  [ subsec : ir ] , and show that the theory tends towards classical einstein gravity in the infrared , see section  [ subsec : physob ] .",

    "neither such a measure nor the related source term @xmath7 is invariant under field reparameterisations .",
