    "the presence of non - axisymmetric distribution of atomic hydrogen gas ( hi ) in spiral galaxies has been known for many years . in a pioneering study , baldwin et al .",
    "( 1980 ) pointed out large scale spatial asymmetry in the hi gas distribution of four nearby spiral galaxies m 101 , ngc 891 , ngc 2841 and ic 342 .",
    "all these galaxies show hi gas extending out to larger radii on one side than on the other .    since then the non - axisymmetric distribution of hi gas has been deduced for much larger samples by studying the asymmetry in the global hi profiles ( richter & sancisi 1994 , matthews et al .",
    "1998 , haynes et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these studies revealed that the hi profiles on the receding and approaching sides are asymmetric .",
    "it was inferred from the sample that at least 50% of galaxies studied show hi lopsidedness . however , without the analysis of 2-d maps of hi discs , the above studies can only indicate the result of lopsidedness caused jointly by the spatial and velocity distribution .",
    "such a quantitative measurement of hi spatial asymmetry from 2-d maps is still to be carried out .",
    "a large fraction of galaxies show asymmetry .",
    "this indicates that the lopsidedness is sustainable over a long period of time .",
    "yet it s physical origin is not clearly understood .",
    "the cause of disc lopsidedness has been attributed to a variety of physical processes , such as the disc response to halo lopsidedness which could arise due to tidal interactions ( jog , 1997 ) , or due to mergers with satellites ( zaritsky & rix 1997 ) , or asymmetric gas accretion ( bournaud et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the asymmetry can also be generated due to a disc offset in a spherical halo @xcite.thus a study of hi asymmetry in the outer parts as done in this paper can give a direct handle on the halo asymmetry if the disc lopsidedness arises due to halo asymmetry .    the existence of asymmetry in the velocity domain , i.e. , kinematical lopsidedness , has also been detected in spiral galaxies.these studies are based on the analysis of asymmetry of the rotation curves on the approaching and receding sides of a galaxy @xcite and also by analysing the hi velocity field of a spiral galaxy directly @xcite .",
    "it is postulated that the same perturbation potential that gives rise to spatial lopsidedness will also unavoidably give rise to kinematical lopsidedness ( jog 1997 , jog 2002 ) .    with the advent of near - ir observations in recent years",
    ", spatial lopsidedness has also been detected in the distribution of old stellar population that make up the main mass component of galactic discs ( block et al .",
    "1994 , rix & zaritsky 1995 ) .",
    "the harmonic analysis is used to fourier analyse the photometric data on the galaxy images , which gives a quantitative measurement of spatial lopsidedness as a function of radius .",
    "it is found that more than 30% of galaxies show strong spatial lopsidedness in near - ir(rix & zaritsky 1995 , zaritsky & rix 1997 , bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ) ; but the increased sky brightness in the near - ir bands limits the measurement of fourier components of stellar asymmetry to radii less than 2.5 exponential disc scale lengths .",
    "it is also not known whether the lopsidedness in hi and near - ir bands are correlated .    in the present work , we fourier - analyse the hi surface density distribution for a sample of eighteen galaxies in the eridanus group of galaxies ( omar & dwarakanath 2005a ) . to our knowledge , this is the first time that an analysis of this kind has been applied for quantitative measurement of hi spatial asymmetry .",
    "the availability of interferometric 2-d maps of galaxies has made this study possible .",
    "since the hi gas usually extends farther out than the stars , the disc lopsidedness can be measured up to twice or more the radial distance than it was possible using stellar light . since the lopsidedness is observed to increase with radius ( rix & zaritsky 1995 , bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ) , the fourier amplitude measured at these distances are expected to provide better constraints on the generating mechanisms for disc lopsidedness .",
    "in addition to this we have also compared the lopsidedness in hi with that in the near - ir band , and show these to be comparable .",
    "we show that the main physical mechanism for the origin of disc lopsidedness for the group galaxies is different than for the field galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", the hi data used for this analysis is described . the harmonic analysis method and the results derived from hi maps and r - band images",
    "are presented in section 3 .",
    "a few general points and the origin of disc lopsidedness are discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 contains a brief summary of the conclusions from the paper .",
    "the eridanus group is a loose group of galaxies at a mean distance of @xmath6 mpc in the southern hemisphere ( , @xmath7 ) . from the redshift values ,",
    "@xmath8 galaxies are associated with this group with heliocentric velocities in the range of @xmath9 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion is @xmath11 km s@xmath10 .",
    "even though there are sub - groups within the system , the overall population mix of the galaxies in the eridanus group was found to be @xmath12 ellipticals and lenticulars and @xmath13 spirals and irregulars ( omar & dwarakanath 2005a).though hi was detected in 31 galaxies out of the 57 selected for observation by omar and dwarakanath using the giant meter - wave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , the spiral galaxies under consideration here form a subset of these .",
    "these spiral galaxies were chosen on the basis of their inclination , with inclinations in the range of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this criterion was adopted so as to get good velocity and surface density maps .",
    "if a galaxy is almost face on , the circular velocity information derived from the velocity map of the galaxy will be reduced to a great extent resulting in greater uncertainty in the inclination .",
    "similarly , if a galaxy is viewed edge - on , the line of sight velocity information will be of good quality , but the surface density map will not be suitable for the spatial lopsidedness analysis . with these criteria , an inclination range of @xmath16-@xmath15 was found suitable .",
    "in addition to this , we eliminated those galaxies where the detection in hi was patchy such as ngc 1415 .",
    "the positions and heliocentric velocities of selected galaxies are given in table 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     _ notes:_the @xmath17 mean value between 1.5 to 2.5 exponential scale lengths is given in column 6 .",
    "the gaussian scale length for hi , @xmath18 , and the resulting @xmath19 and @xmath20 over 1 - 2 @xmath18 are shown in columns 7 and 8 respectively .",
    "+ the mean of @xmath21 in the range 1.5 to 2.5 @xmath22 is @xmath23 and the mean of @xmath19 in the 1 to 2 @xmath18 range is @xmath24.the mean of @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "+ these results do not change much if the galaxies with i @xmath27 and with @xmath28 are eliminated from the sample - in that case the mean of @xmath29 between 1.5 - 2.5 @xmath30 and mean of @xmath31 between 1 - 2 @xmath32",
    "* 1 . distribution of lopsidedness *    we have carried out the fourier harmonic analysis for the hi surface density of the eridanus group of galaxies . all the eighteen galaxies studied show significant average lopsidedness with a mean value of @xmath21 = 0.24 in the inner regions of @xmath33 kpc , which is more than twice the average value observed for field galaxies ( zaritsky & rix 1997 , bournaud et al .",
    "a large fraction @xmath34 show even higher lopsidedness with a value of @xmath35 , whereas only 7% of the field galaxies have such high lopsidedness ( bournaud et al . 2005 ) . in the field galaxies @xmath36 of galaxies",
    "show @xmath37 , whereas in the eridanus sample @xmath38 of the galaxies show this.in the present paper , we have measured the values in the outer discs ( @xmath39 5 kpc ) or outside of 2.5 exponential disc scale lengths as well , and find that the average value of mean lopsidedness measured in the outer regions is slightly higher(= 0.27 ) .",
    "phases of lopsidedness *    from fig .",
    "3 , we see that the values of the phase angles of 15 galaxies in the eridanus group remains nearly constant without sudden jumps ; the exceptions being ngc 1309 , ugca 077 and ngc 1371.this means the surface density contours have egg - shaped rather than one - armed profiles , and the potential causing the disc lopsidedness can be taken to have no radial phase dependence .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour seen in the inner regions as traced by the near - ir studies in rix & zaritsky ( 1995)- see jog ( 1997 ) for a discussion of this topic .",
    "a nearly constant phase implies that these are global m=1 modes .",
    "* 3 . origin of disc lopsidedness in group galaxies *    we have shown above that the overall average values of @xmath0 in the eridanus group galaxies in the inner regions are higher by a factor of two compared to the field galaxies(@xmath40,bournaud et al.,2005 ) , and @xmath41 of the sample galaxies show such a high value of lopsidedness .",
    "the similar values for lopsidedness measured in both stars and gas in the inner regions show that this indicate true lopsidedness .",
    "however we caution that , since the number of galaxies studied in hi and r - band is small and the radial range of overlap for the comparison ( see fig .",
    "4 ) is small , some of the difference in the lopsidedness in the group vs. the field cases could perhaps still be attributed to the different tracers used ( hi for the group case and the stars for the field case respectively . )",
    "the overall higher value of @xmath0 measured implies that a group environment is more effective in generating lopsidedness in discs of galaxies , either via tidal interactions that can distort the halo and then affect the disc ( jog 1997 ) , or via asymmetric gas accretion ( bournaud et al .",
    "while we can not give a clear preference for either one of these mechanisms based on the present work , tidal interactions appear to be more likely as argued below .    given the high number density of galaxies in a group , a higher frequency and strength of tidal interactions are expected .",
    "thus a tidal origin can explain the high frequency as well as the higher strength of lopsidedness observed in the eridanus group of galaxies compared to a sample of field galaxies .",
    "theoretically one can explain the similar observed values of lopsidedness for stars and hi gas ( section 3.2 ) , if the origin of lopsidedness is due to a linear disc response to a distorted halo ( jog 1997 ) . in this case",
    ", the likely origin of the halo distortion or lopsidedness could be due to tidal interactions between galaxies ( weinberg 1995 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the galaxies in the eridanus group exhibit hi deficiency , which is ascribed to tidal interaction ( omar & dwarakanath 2005b ) .",
    "this also might indicate that the higher average values of lopsidedness which we have observed could be due to tidal interaction .",
    "we note that in contrast , a typical field sample showed no correlation in the stellar lopsidedness measured in the inner disc regions with a tidal parameter ( bournaud et al . 2005 ) .    in the field case ,",
    "the late type galaxies show a higher lopsidedness and are also more likely to be lopsided ( see fig . 7 , bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ; also see zaritsky & rix 1997 , matthews et al .",
    "1998 ) . to check",
    "if this could be a spurious reason for the high @xmath0 measured in our sample , we plotted @xmath0 vs. the galaxy type for our sample .",
    "interestingly , this shows an opposite trend , namely we get a weak correlation showing a _ decrease _ in @xmath0 for later type galaxies ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the strong correlation in @xmath0 with galaxy type , with @xmath0 increasing for later type galaxies , that is seen in previous studies which involved field galaxies .",
    "hence the high values of @xmath0 measured here can not be due to the type of galaxies included in the sample .",
    "these two results : namely , the higher average value of @xmath0 measured for the eridanus group galaxies , and the weak anti - correlation of @xmath0 vs. galaxy hubble type , clearly indicate that the main physical mechanism for the origin of the disc lopsidedness in a group environment is different from that for the field galaxies",
    ". perhaps the gas accretion , which plays an important role in causing lopsidedness in the field galaxies ( bournaud et al .",
    "2005 ) , may not be so important in a group , especially since a group probably does not have much cold gas .",
    "we note that the earlier work on the measurement of hi asymmetry in sculptor group galaxies ( schoenmakers 2000 ) also showed kinematical lopsidedness in all the five galaxies studied .",
    "however , this method gives a value for the perturbation parameter for the potential times a term dependent on the inclination angle only .",
    "the average value for this product is @xmath42 which is much smaller than the average value of @xmath43= @xmath44 ( table 2 ) obtained in the present paper for the 18 eridanus group galaxies .",
    "we have measured @xmath0 the amplitude of the first fourier component over the average value for the surface density of hi in a sample of 18 galaxies in the eridanus group of galaxies , by fourier analysis of the interferometric 2-d data ( omar & dwarakanath 2005a ) on these galaxies .",
    "this is the first quantitative measurement of the spatial lopsidedness using hi data .",
    "the summary of conclusions from this paper is as follows :    \\1 .",
    "all the galaxies studied show significant lopsidedness , with average @xmath45 in the region of 1.5 - 2.5 disc scale lengths .",
    "a large fraction @xmath46 show even higher average lopsidedness @xmath47 .",
    "for a few of the galaxies , the stellar r - band data available in the inner regions were analyzed , and the resulting values of lopsidedness are shown to be similar to the hi lopsidedness . the same amplitudes for stars and gas can be naturally explained if both arise due to a linear response of the disc to a distorted or lopsided halo ( jog 1997 ) .",
    "the lopsidedness is observed to increase with radius , and the outer regions have an average @xmath0 value of @xmath48 .",
    "the present work measures @xmath0 in discs up to the edge of the optical discs or four exponential disc scale lengths , and in a few cases even beyond that .",
    "this is more than twice the distance that is typically studied in the stellar distribution via near - ir photometry .",
    "this can help provide constraints on the origin of lopsidedness in discs , especially since lopsidedness is higher at larger radii.from the observed @xmath0 values , the halo distortion is deduced to be @xmath49",
    "the overall higher value of lopsidedness @xmath0 measured in the inner regions in the eridanus group galaxies compared to the field galaxies ( e.g. , bournaud et al . 2005 ) ; and the smaller values of lopsidedness observed for the later hubble type galaxies - which is opposite to the trend seen in field galaxies , together imply that a different physical mechanism is responsible for the origin of the disc lopsidedness in a group environment .    the present work highlights the need for a future dynamical study of the origin and evolution of disc lopsidedness in galaxies in groups .",
    "this can help in understanding the interactions and also the halo properties for galaxies in groups .",
    "we thank the referee , frederic bournaud , for critical comments especially stressing the necessity of making a comparison of the stellar and hi lopsidedness to confirm that the origin of the measured asymmetry in hi is due to the group environment .",
