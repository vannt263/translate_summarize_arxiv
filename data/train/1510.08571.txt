    "magnetospheres @xcite are the paradigm of systems that seemingly exhibit deviation from the classical understanding of physical principles . through the process of inward diffusion ( or radial / up - hill diffusion ) , magnetized particles build - up an heterogeneous structure along the equator of the dipole magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the resulting formation of a radiation belt seems to contradict the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "recently , self - organization of such plasma structures was put in the perspective of a topologically constrained particle dynamics arising from adiabatic invariants of magnetized particles @xcite .",
    "further investigations have shown the consistency of the theory with the observed rigidly rotating thermal equilibrium of non - neutral plasmas in a magnetospheric configuration @xcite .",
    "additional research has led to the formulation of a diffusion operator on an appropriate phase space reflecting the geometrical constraints imposed by adiabatic invariants : a flat distribution in these proper coordinates yields a non - uniform density in the cartesian reference system @xcite .",
    "the interest in the mechanism of magnetospheric self - organization stems from the wide areas of both theoretical and applied physics involved in its understanding .",
    "a well - known mathematical issue is whether variable reduction resulting from topological constraints leads to a lagrangian / hamiltonian formalism @xcite on the contracted space .",
    "this problem relates to the type of dynamical constraints ( holonomic or not ) affecting the system @xcite . from the point of view of plasma physics ,",
    "it is desirable to precisely understand the mechanism behind dipole confinement , especially for nuclear fusion and matter / antimatter confinement applications @xcite .",
    "planetary magnetospheres are also the object of intense astronomical observations @xcite for their relevance in space weather forecasting .",
    "recent measurements in the rt-1 machine have reported the role of inward diffusion in heating - up the confined plasma concurrently with breaking of the second adiabatic invariant @xcite .",
    "this suggests that magnetized particles not only accumulate to form a radiation belt , but also undergo a progressive acceleration due to the topological constraint affecting the non - spatial part of phase - space .",
    "magnetospheric self - organization works both as a magnetic trap and a heating device .    in the present paper ,",
    "extending the diffusion model developed in @xcite , we investigate this acceleration mechanism .    in section",
    "ii we write down the guiding center equations of motion under investigation . in section",
    "iii we separate cyclotron motion and reduce the dynamical space to a foliation .",
    "the equations of motion are then rewritten in terms of the novel coordinates spanning it .",
    "we further show that the reduced flow is measure preserving , even if not written in terms of canonically paired variables . in section",
    "iv canonical variables are constructed by deriving the associated symplectic @xmath0-form . in section",
    "v we obtain the corresponding fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) . in sections vi and vii we make a correspondence between the parameters of the fpe for inward diffusion and the time - scale / strength of fluctuations .",
    "the relation of diffusion with preservation of bounce action is also shown . in section viii",
    "we study the plasma temperature profile : our equation predicts a higher anisotropy for faster , stronger diffusion , with the corresponding destruction of the second adiabatic invariant .",
    "the phenomenon of preferential heating of the normal temperature is also reproduced .",
    "section ix is for the conclusions .",
    "finally , we will exploit stochastic calculus to handle the change of variables from magnetic coordinates on the foliation to the oridnary cartesian reference system @xcite .",
    "we study the dynamics of a gyrating particle obeying the guiding center equations :    @xmath1    here , @xmath2 is the magnetic moment , @xmath3 the electric charge , @xmath4 the magnetic field , @xmath5 the flux function , @xmath6 the toroidal angle , @xmath7 the electric potential , @xmath8 the velocity along magnetic field lines , @xmath9 the length along a field line , @xmath10 the curvature of the magnetic field , @xmath11 the particle velocity , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and curvature drifts , and the pedix notation is used for derivation , except when differently specified .",
    "conservation of magnetic moment @xmath2 implies that we can separate the canonical pair @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the phase of the gyration , from the full particle dynamics invariant measure :    dxdydzdp_xdp_ydp_z = m^2dldv_ddd_cd[im ]    the @xmath19 symbol underlines the operated separation . here , @xmath20 are the usual canonical variables and we used the fact that @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in our notation @xmath27",
    "is the unit tangent vector to field lines , @xmath28 the unit normal vector to field lines , @xmath29 the unit vector in the toroidal direction .",
    "thanks to the separation , the actual dynamical variables are reduced to @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "let us translate equations ( [ ap ] ) and ( [ vd ] ) in these new coordinates :    @xmath32    where we introduced the quantity @xmath33 .",
    "one can verify that the above equations are already measure preserving : if @xmath34 is the dynamical flow and @xmath35 , we have    @xmath36    this result is important , because the property required to introduce a consistent definition of entropy on the foliation ( _ leaf - entropy _ ) is a preserved volume element on the contracted space .",
    "however , as we will see later on , @xmath31 are not canonical variables .",
    "we also underline that a lacking invariant measure is not an impediment when building a statistical mechanics on the separated leaf .",
    "in order to obtain canonical variables , we look for the two - form @xmath37 describing the dynamical flow @xmath38 :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is a contraction and @xmath41 the energy of the system . to calculate @xmath37 , we need @xmath41 .",
    "we expect the energy function :    @xmath42    to be constant under the flow generated by @xmath38 . this is because guiding center drifts result from neglecting the particle mass in the equations of motion perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "this means that drifts do not contribute with their kinetic energy to @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , one can verify that @xmath43 .",
    "solving equation ( [ omega2 ] ) for @xmath37 , one obtains :    @xmath44    for the system to be hamiltonian , @xmath37 must be non - degenerate and exact . that the determinant of @xmath37 is different from zero is straightforward ,",
    "thus this two - form is non - degenerate .",
    "let us see how @xmath37 is also exact , i.e. @xmath45 , for some one - form @xmath46 . from ( [ omega2b ] ) :    @xmath47+d\\psi\\wedge d\\theta+qd\\psi\\wedge dv_{\\parallel}= dv_{\\parallel}\\wedge dl+d\\psi\\wedge d\\left(\\theta+qv_{\\parallel}\\right)=d\\left(v_{\\parallel}dl+\\psi d\\eta\\right)\\label{omega2c } % \\end{dmath}\\ ] ]    where we introduced the new variable @xmath48 .",
    "( [ omega2c ] ) shows that @xmath37 is exact , with @xmath49 .",
    "it follows that @xmath50 and @xmath51 form two canonical pairs .",
    "to investigate the heating mechanism of inward diffusion , we will study the time evolution of the guiding centers distribution function by solving an appropriate fpe . the procedure required to obtain it is given in @xcite . here , we extend this equation by adding the toroidal angle @xmath6 and by introducing curvature effects .    in order to derive the desired transport equation we need to convert equations ( [ ldot ] ) , ( [ vdot ] ) , ( [ thetadot ] ) , and ( [ psidot ] ) to a system of stochastic differential equations . to understand the conversion procedure ,",
    "it is useful to give a formal discussion of the exploited working hypothesis ( @xmath52 stands for ensemble average ) :    @xmath53 .",
    "we assume overall charge neutrality @xmath54 .",
    "the drifting velocity @xmath12 , belonging to the tangent bundle @xmath55 , is a random processes with null ensemble average :    @xmath56    this requirement , which physically states that there are no deterministic currents associated with the fluctuations , is important when applying the change of variables formula of stochastic calculus .",
    "a formal justification of equation ( [ ens ] ) follows by noting that charge neutrality implies : @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 . electromagnetic fluctuations are such that the ergodic hypothesis is satisfied on the leaf @xmath31 obtained by separating cyclotron motion @xmath17 from the original invariant measure ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "physically , this requirement is just saying that the first adiabatic invariant is such robust that the actual phase - space accessible to the magnetized rings is the symplectic sub - manifold @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , we build a ( possibly constrained ) statistical mechanics on this reduced invariant measure by introducing wiener processes . in mathematical terms",
    "we are asking the ` leaf ' electric field to satisfy :    @xmath60    here @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are gaussian white noises with @xmath64 .",
    "the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are constants scaling the strength of diffusion .",
    "let us calculate the expression of the electric field @xmath68 in the usual cartesian coordinates :    = d_^1/2_l+d_^1/2_+d_^1/2_[e ]    using equation ( [ e ] ) , the @xmath15 velocity becomes :    _ = d_^1/2_-(d_^1/2_+qd_^1/2_)_[vexb ]    note that this expression is consistent with equation ( [ ens ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to deduce the spatial displacements @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 along @xmath29 and @xmath71 caused by ( [ vexb ] ) ( upper - case letters are used to specify random variables ) :    @xmath72    in order to obtain the desired stochastic differential equations , it is sufficient to apply the change of variables formula of stochastic calculus , by noting that the changes @xmath73 and @xmath74 are affected by @xmath70 , the change @xmath75 by @xmath69 , and the change @xmath76 by @xmath77 and @xmath78 :    @xmath79\\right\\}dt+qd_{\\perp}^{1/2}dw_{\\perp}\\label{dl}\\\\ & dv_{\\parallel}=-\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{m}b_{l}+\\gamma v_{\\parallel}-\\mathfrak{c}_{v_{\\parallel } } \\right)dt+d_{\\parallel}^{1/2}dw_{\\parallel}-d^{1/2}_{\\perp}v_{\\parallel}q_{l}dw_{\\perp}\\label{dv}\\\\ & d\\theta=\\left[\\frac{\\mu}{e}\\left(\\partial_{\\psi}+q\\partial_{l}\\right)b+\\mathfrak{c}_{\\theta}-\\frac{m}{e}v^{2}_{\\parallel}q_{l}\\right]dt - d_{\\theta}^{1/2}dw_{\\theta}-\\frac{m}{e}qd_{\\parallel}^{1/2}dw_{\\parallel}\\label{dtheta}\\\\ & d\\psi=\\left[d_{\\perp}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\alpha\\right)\\left(\\partial_{\\psi}+q\\partial_{l}\\right)\\ln\\left(rb\\right)+\\mathfrak{c}_{\\psi}\\right]dt+d_{\\perp}^{1/2}dw_{\\perp}\\label{dpsi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the last step is to translate these equations into a fpe . the result is :    = -\\{v_+(-)d_+_l}p + ( b_l+v_-_v_)p - p -p + d_q^2p+d_+d _ -d_qp+ d_q^2p+ d_+d_qp - d_p -d_v_qq_lp + d_(v_q_l)^2p -d_v_q_lp + d_p [ fpe ]    here , the parameter @xmath80 $ ] defines the stochastic integral and we introduced friction terms @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 that are required to preserve the total energy when the system is closed .",
    "@xmath86 is the distribution function ( probability density ) in @xmath87 space .",
    "the objective of this section is to show that the definition of the stochastic integral , i.e. the value of the parameter    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is an arbitrary time and we used @xmath90 , is ultimately determined by the ratio between time - scale of fluctuations @xmath91 and period of bounce motion @xmath92 .",
    "indeed , when a fluctuation starts to act , the electric field felt by a particle can be represented as :    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the typical decay time of the fluctuation .",
    "integrating equation ( [ alpha ] ) gives :    @xmath95^{2}\\ ] ]    here , we used the fact that the decay time is given by :    @xmath96    with @xmath97 the typical size of fluctuation domains in the direction perpendicular to field lines , @xmath98 the temperature anisotropy , @xmath99 and @xmath100 the perpendicular and parallel temperatures respectively , @xmath101 the typical bounce orbit length , @xmath102 the frequency of the fluctuations , and we set @xmath103 . the limiting cases of interest are : @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "consequently , we expect fast fluctuations @xmath106 to be better represented by the choice @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 will instead describe slow oscillations .",
    "in order to relate emergence of temperature anisotropy and destruction of the second adiabatic invariant , we need to understand the conditions under which the bounce action @xmath109 is preserved for the system under examination .",
    "a direct calculation shows that :    = t ( _ ( b+e)_-_(b+e ) _ -q_(b+e)_l+_mv_^2q_l)[djdt3 ]    here , @xmath110 is the bounce orbit average , with @xmath111 the period of the bounce oscillation .",
    "two important conclusions can be drawn from the result ( [ djdt3 ] ) .",
    "if the period of the bounce oscillation is small enough with respect to the time scale under consideration , @xmath112 can be neglected .",
    "the additional requirement of a small electric field @xmath113 results in even smaller variations of @xmath109 .",
    "however , when electromagnetic fluctuations are fast enough , i.e. their time scale @xmath91 is such that @xmath114 , and when their amplitude is not negligible ( @xmath115 ) , the second adiabatic invariant is destroyed .",
    "the latter condition correspond to a large diffusion parameter @xmath116 and the choice @xmath107 in the fpe .    taking the bounce orbit average ,",
    "one recovers the classical result @xmath117 of @xcite .",
    "however , we remark that @xmath112 is well represented by its bounce orbit average only for slow and weak fluctuations @xmath113 .",
    "in the following we investigate the numerical solution to equation ( [ fpe ] ) , focusing on the evolution of temperature profiles .",
    "we assume a maxwell - boltzmann distribution as initial condition and take dirichlet boundaries .",
    "axial symmetry @xmath118 is also used .",
    "we will show that self - organization of a peaked profile goes together with preferential heating of the normal temperature :    @xmath119    indeed , when particles climb up the magnetic field as a result of inward diffusion , they preserve the magnetic moment @xmath2 : the stronger the magnetic field , the larger the normal kinetic energy @xmath120 stored in the cyclotron gyration . at the same time , particles with enough parallel kinetic energy @xmath121 have a high probability of exiting the boundaries ( falling into the atmosphere of the planet ) as the magnetic field is not strong enough to reverse their motion . with a stronger diffusion ,",
    "the process speeds up and this translates in a systematic depopulation of particles with high parallel temperature :    @xmath122    the scenario described above is reproduced numerically in figure [ fig1 ] , where two cases with different diffusion strength @xmath66 are compared ( in the first case , @xmath66 is ten times the value it takes in the second one ) .     and @xmath123 as a function of time @xmath124 .",
    "@xmath125 stands for strong and fast diffusion . @xmath126 for weak and slow diffusion .",
    "the former case has a diffusion parameter @xmath66 ten times greater than the latter . ]",
    "it is also instructive to look at the radial profiles of the temperatures @xmath99 and @xmath100 in the two cases described above ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the preferential heating effect of the normal temperature due to inward diffusion is evident .     and @xmath127 for the weaker diffusion parameter case .",
    "( b ) : radial profiles of @xmath128 and @xmath127 for the stronger diffusion parameter case .",
    "the @xmath129 indicates the initial distribution . here , @xmath130 is the radial coordinate of a cylindrical reference system @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath132 is set to zero . ]",
    "in this paper , continuing the efforts made to understand the physics of self - organization in magnetospheric plasmas @xcite , we make important progress in the theoretical description of inward diffusion .",
    "topological constraints dictate a natural reduction of phase space .",
    "however , there are several delicate problems , part of them yet unsolved , that have to be addressed when building a statistical mechanics on the foliation ( existence of invariant measure , ergodicity , notion of entropy ) . nevertheless , it is this reduced mechanics that is able to cast inward diffusion , and more generally self - organization phenomena , in the classical perspective of thermodynamics .",
    "then , spatial gradients , temperature anisotropies , and preferential heating are just a consequence of a coordinate transformation connecting cartesian coordinates to the foliation ."
