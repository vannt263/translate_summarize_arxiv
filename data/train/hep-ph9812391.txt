    "the axion  @xcite , the pseudo - goldstone boson arising as a result of the spontaneous breakdown of the global peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry @xmath1 , is one of the well - motivated candidates for the cold dark matter ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the original axion , associated with the pq symmetry breakdown at the weak scale ( @xmath2 ) , is excluded experimentally , many variants of the pq models and their accompanying axions are of great interest .",
    "if the breaking scale of the pq symmetry @xmath3 is much larger than the electroweak scale @xmath4 ( the latest astrophysical data yield @xmath5  gev ) , the resulting `` invisible axion ''  @xcite is very light ( @xmath6 ) and very weakly coupled ( coupling @xmath7 ) .    in view of the smallness of the coupling constant",
    ", axion effects could be noticeable under astrophysical conditions ",
    "high matter densities , high temperature , and strong magnetic fields .",
    "so , it is important to take into account the influence of a plasma and magnetic fields in studies of axion processes in stars .",
    "one of the most physically realistic situations presented in many astrophysical objects is that when from both these components of the active medium the plasma dominates : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electron chemical potential and temperature , respectively .",
    "while this situation corresponds to a relatively weak magnetic field , it can still be strong @xmath11 in comparison with the electron s schwinger value @xmath12  g. at present an existence of magnetic fields up to @xmath13  g is not exotic in astrophysics  @xcite and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "a possible manifestation of axions effects under such conditions is of great interest .    in the recent paper  @xcite the axion cyclotron emission of the plasma @xmath14",
    "was studied as a possible source of energy losses by astrophysical objects . in this paper",
    "we study the annihilation process @xmath0 in medium as an additional channel of energy losses and compare the emissivity by this process with the axion cyclotron emissivity under the condition of a nondegenerate hot plasma .",
    "the process @xmath0 is described by two diagrams in fig .  [",
    "fig : eea ]    = .80    where solid double lines imply the influence of medium in the electron and positron wave functions and the photon propagator .",

    "the field - induced coupling @xmath44 is a step function of the magnetic field strength because of the hierarchy of the fermion mass spectrum .",
    "the case of ultrarelativistic electrons and the relatively weak external magnetic field , when a large number of the landau levels is excited , is well described by a crossed field limit ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) , and the dynamic parameter @xmath47 is the only field invariant .",
