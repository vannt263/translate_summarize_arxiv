    "<S> graphene has been in the focus of intensive research since its discovery @xcite , followed by silicene , si@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> practical application of graphene in nanoelectronics is somewhat limited by the lack of a band gap , and while alternatives such as hexagonal boron nitride @xcite and transition metal dichalcogenides @xcite exist and others have been predicted theoretically such as gallium chalcogenides @xcite , significant research effort has been put into engineering a band gap in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> complete hydrogenation was shown to be another way to engineer a band gap in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting material , graphane @xcite ( c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) has a buckled honeycomb structure with a single hydrogen atom attached to each carbon site on alternating sides of the sheet . </S>",
    "<S> a recent experiment @xcite has shown that few - layer germanane ( ge@xmath0h@xmath0 ) , the hydrogenated germanene , can be synthesised , expanding the family of atomic 2d materials .    in this work </S>",

    "<S> we present the phonon dispersions to illustrate that these materials are dynamically stable . </S>",
    "<S> the band structures , effective masses , charge carriers , and an orbital decomposition of the valence and conduction bands at high symmetry points in the brillouin zone are presented . </S>",

    "<S> the unit cell comprises two si / ge atoms and two h atoms , and the a and b sublattices of si / ge atoms exhibit a buckling . </S>",
    "<S> the tight - binding model we employ is an all - valence second - nearest neighbour model that takes into account four ( one @xmath5 and three @xmath6 ) electrons per si / ge atom and the single electron of hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the tight - binding hamiltonian is    @xmath7    here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath5 electrons of si / ge , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the same for the @xmath6 electrons of si / ge , while @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the same for the electrons of the h atoms . in @xmath14 , parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the on - site energies of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals of si / ge , @xmath17 is the on - site energy of the electron of the hydrogen atom . in @xmath18 , @xmath19 parameterises the nearest neighbour hopping between @xmath5 orbitals of si / ge and hydrogen , while @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the nearest neighbour hoppings between si / ge electrons on sublattice a and sublattice b. in @xmath24 , parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the second - nearest neighbour hoppings between the si / ge electrons on the same sublattice , while @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the second - nearest neighbour hoppings between the orbitals of si / ge and hydrogen on different sublattices . </S>",
    "<S> summations in @xmath31 go over the a and b sublattices while summations in @xmath32 and @xmath33 go over @xmath34 ; @xmath35,@xmath36 , and @xmath37 take into account the orientation of the @xmath6 orbitals , where @xmath38 denotes the coordinates of the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian in the slater  </S>",
    "<S> koster approach @xcite , shown with solid lines separating a and b sublattice contributions as well as hydrogen contributions has the form of a @xmath39 matrix :    @xmath40    the total number of parameters in this model is sixteen , but one can choose one of the on - site energies to be zero to set the fermi level leaving fifteen parameters to fit . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting model can be used to provide a simple semiempirical reproduction of first - principles band structures , as we will show below .    </S>",
    "<S> [ secdft ]    \\(ii ) the parameters in this model , as well as the justification for the choice of orbitals comes from first - principles studies using density functional theory ( dft ) implemented in the vasp @xcite plane - wave - basis code . </S>",
    "<S> first , we calculated the lattice parameters of silicane and germanane with multiple semilocal exchange - correlation functionals : the local density approximation ( lda ) and the perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite ( pbe ) functionals . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the screened heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof 06 ( hse06 ) functional @xcite was used to obtain the electronic band structures to compensate ( at least partially ) for the underestimation of the band gap by semilocal functionals . </S>",
    "<S> the plane - wave cutoff energy was 500 ev . a @xmath41 monkhorst - pack * k*-point grid was used for geometry optimisations while a @xmath42 grid was used to calculate the band structures . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical separation of periodic images of the monolayer was set to 15   . </S>",
    "<S> the force tolerance in the optimisation was 0.005 ev /  . </S>",
    "<S> phonons were calculated with the force constant approach in a @xmath43 supercell .    [ results ]    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relaxed structure of both silicane and germanane is very similar to that of graphane , as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : structure ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters listed were obtained after a full geometry optimisation . </S>",
    "<S> the bond lengths obtained with the pbe functional are systematically larger than those optimised with the lda , as expected @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the hydrogenation is accompanied by a significant increase in the magnitude of the sublattice buckling when compared to silicene and germanene , where , according to lda / pbe , @xmath44    and @xmath45   , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> lattice constants and sublattice bucklings agree with previous literature within @xmath46% and @xmath47% , respectively @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated electronic band structures are plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bands ] . in comparison </S>",
    "<S> to graphane @xcite one important difference in silicane and germanane is that in the latter two materials a band appears close to the conduction band edge at the m point . while the conduction band minimum of ge@xmath0h@xmath0 is at the @xmath48 point similar to c@xmath0h@xmath0 , in the case of si@xmath0h@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> it is in fact at the m point , making silicane an indirect gap semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the band gaps of silicane and germanane are 2.91 ev and 1.90 ev , respectively , according to the hse06 functional which is expected to underestimate the gap by no more than 10  % @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the conduction band is anisotropic at the m point with a heavy effective mass in the @xmath48 direction . </S>",
    "<S> our finding that the band gap of si@xmath0h@xmath0 is indirect and that of ge@xmath0h@xmath0 is direct is supported by previous literature using a variety of methods ranging from semi - local dft through hybrid functionals to single - shot gw @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> our results on @xmath51 compare well with ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that we find almost no sign of anisotropy in the effective masses at @xmath48 . in comparison to the literature on graphene , </S>",

    "<S> fig : bands ] show the spin - orbit induced splitting of the valence band at the @xmath48 point . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of spin - orbit coupling is more pronounced in the case of germanane where the valence band splits by an energy difference of 202 mev at @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we discuss the orbital composition of the valence and conduction bands of silicane and germanane ( see table [ table : orb_decomp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at the @xmath48 point the valence band consists of si / ge @xmath52 and @xmath53 orbitals , while the conduction band is dominantly si / ge @xmath5 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> however , at the m point the conduction band also contains si / ge @xmath52 and @xmath53 contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the h @xmath5 orbital also contributes at the m point , to the valence band in silicane ( and slightly to the conduction band in germanane ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that for a tight - binding description of silicane and germanane an all valence description is required taking into account the @xmath5 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 orbitals of si / ge , as well as the h @xmath5 orbital .    </S>",
    "<S> .orbital decomposition of the valence and conduction bands of silicane and germanane at the @xmath48 and m points according to the local density approximation . </S>",
    "<S> [ table : orb_decomp ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\(iii ) we used the hse06 band structures as reference to obtain the tight - binding parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the tight - binding band structure can reproduce the entirety of the dft valence band and the vicinity of the conduction band at both the @xmath48 and m points ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tbbands ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note here that if we neglect second - nearest neighbour interactions the valence band can still be reproduced but the behaviour of the conduction band at the m point can not , which indicates that the second nearest neighbour interactions are responsible for the minimum in the conduction band at the m point . also , the @xmath1-shell of si / ge is likely to affect states in the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit is achieved with the parameters listed in the legend of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tbbands ] ; the fitting was optimised to give a quantitative description of the valence band and the conduction band near the @xmath48 and the m point .    . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : tbbands ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    [ secstability ]    \\(iv ) finally , we have performed a full geometry optimisation of si@xmath0h@xmath0 and ge@xmath0h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> while the geometry optimisation yields an energetically stable configuration for both materials , it is necessary to examine their phonon dispersions in order to ascertain whether they are dynamically stable . </S>",
    "<S> we find that silicane is stable as there is no sign of any dynamical instability anywhere along the high symmetry lines of the brillouin zone ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phonons ] ) . in the case of ge@xmath0h@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> we find a small pocket of instability for the flexural acoustic phonons . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this is an artifact arising due to the difficulty in converging the flexural acoustic branch of two - dimensional materials as the phonon wave vector goes to zero . since we find no other pockets of instability in any of the other branches we conclude that germanane is also dynamically stable . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important finding as the experiments in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite were performed on multilayers of germanane on a substrate , while our calculations predict that suspended single - layer germanane would be stable , too .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that there is an alternate configuration for silicane and germanane not considered here . </S>",
    "<S> the so - called chair - like structure we studied corresponds to the case when h atoms alternate on the two sides of the sheet such that for each sublattice the h atom is on a fixed side . in the so - called boat configuration the h atoms alternate in pairs instead , which slightly increases the unit cell size . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has been shown to be notably less stable than the chair configuration in the case of graphane @xcite , nevertheless the boat configuration of silicane and germanane has been found to be stable @xcite which is important to bear in mind .     </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : phonons ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    [ secconclusion ]    in conclusion we have shown using first - principles density functional theory that freestanding hydrogenated silicene and germanene , better known as silicane and germanane , are energetically and dynamically stable . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that silicane is an indirect and germanane a direct gap semiconductor and derived a tight binding model to describe the valence and conduction bands of these materials , fitting the parameters to hybrid density functional calculations . </S>",
    "<S> a minimum in the conduction band at the m point is caused by second nearest neighbour interaction which , in the case of silicane , leads to an indirect band gap .    </S>",
