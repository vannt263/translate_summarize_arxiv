    "interest in anomalous diffusion processes was rekindled with the advance of modern spectroscopic methods , in particular , advanced single particle tracking methods @xcite .",
    "thus , subdiffusion was observed for the motion of biopolymers and submicron tracer particles in living biological cells @xcite , in complex fluids @xcite , as well as in extensive computer simulations of membranes @xcite or structured systems @xcite , among others @xcite .",
    "superdiffusion of tracer particles was observed in living cells due to active motion @xcite .",
    "anomalous diffusion processes characterised by the msd ( [ msd ] ) may originate from a variety of distinct physical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "these include a power - law statistic of trapping times in the continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) as well as related random energy models @xcite and ctrw variants with correlated jumps @xcite or superimposed environmental noise @xcite .",
    "other models include random processes driven by gaussian yet power - law correlated noise such as fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) @xcite or the fractional langevin equation @xcite . closely related to these models is the subdiffusive motion on fractals such as critical percolation clusters @xcite .",

    "we study the ergodic properties of sbm in the boltzmann - khinchin sense @xcite , finding that even long time averages of physical observables such as the msd do not converge to the corresponding ensemble average @xcite .",
    "in particular we compute the ergodicity breaking parameter eb  characterising the trajectory - to - trajectory fluctuations of the time averaged msd  in the entire range of the scaling exponents @xmath1 , both analytically and from extensive computer simulations .",
