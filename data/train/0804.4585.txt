    "the merging of two galaxies will produce a binary black hole at the center of the newly formed galaxy .",

    "the gravitational waves carry away linear momentum , causing the centre of mass of the coalescing bh system to recoil in the opposite direction ( peres 1962 , bekenstein 1973 ) .",
    "early analytical calculations predicted that mergers of non - spinning black holes can attain kicks with velocities of up to a few hundred kms@xmath0 ( e.g. , fitchett & detweiler 1984 , favata et al .",

    "these velocities are above the escape velocity of dwarf galaxies , low - mass spirals , and high - redshift dark matter halos .",

    "these kick velocities exceed the escape velocities of even massive elliptical galaxies ( fig . 2 of merritt et al .",
    "2004 ) and therefore the new results reinforce and enhance consequences studied earlier for the smaller kicks , with potentially far - reaching implications for the early phases of bh growth from early stellar - mass precursors or later intermediate - mass precursors ( schnittman 2007 , volonteri 2007 ) and consequently for the frequency of gravitational wave signals detectable with _ lisa _ ( sesana 2007 ) , for the scatter in the @xmath1 relation ( libeskind et al .",

    "2008 ) . because of the broad astrophysical implications , the search for and actual identification of such recoiling black holes is of great interest , and will place important constraints on bh growth during the epoch of structure formation , on predictions of maximum recoil velocity , and on arguments suggesting that the bh spin configurations leading to maximal recoil velocities should be rare in gas - rich mergers ( bogdanovi et al . 2007 )",

    "two systems of strong emission lines can be identified in the spectrum , which we refer to as the `` red '' ( r ) and `` blue '' ( b ) systems .",

    "the blue system shows classical broad balmer and mgii2798 emission lines ( bels ) , plus unusually broad nels ( blue nels , b - nels hereafter ) .",
    "all lines of the blue system are blueshifted by about 2650 kms@xmath0 relative to the r - nels(see tab . 1 for redshifts ; the value of 2650 kms@xmath0 is the shift between broad h@xmath10 and r-[oiii ] ) .",

    "we have performed the following test .",
    "we have first subtracted the best - fit continuum , feii multiplets , and nels from the observed spectrum , and then fit the h@xmath10 regime with two broad gaussians .",

    "this rare source would have to be projected by chance behind the other unusual agn .",
    "we are therefore let to consider the alternative hypothesis that we actually see only one agn , its smbh and bound emission - line region having been ejected from the core with a line - of - sight speed of 2650 kms@xmath0 , while the bulk of the narrow - line region ( nlr ) and other interstellar medium ( ism ) was left behind and shines in narrow emission lines .",

    "( 2008 ) paid attention to , but did not detect .",
    "in this picture , sdssj0927 + 2943 underwent a merger in the past . upon merging , its central smbh recoiled taking with it the blr and perhaps other very high ionization gas , leaving behind the nlr .",
    "gas with a velocity larger than the recoil velocity will remain bound to the smbh , and a trail of partially bound gas may form .",
    "accretion activity may have switched off temporarily in the course of the binary smbh merging , once the orbital decay time due to emission of gravitational waves had become smaller than the viscous timescale of the disk ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2003 , milosavljevi & phinney 2005 ) .",
    "after coalescence , the inner disk will re - form quickly ( loeb 2007 ) and the accreting smbh will then illuminate the bound gas , a trail of partially bound gas and swept - up ism , the surrounding ism / halo and the left - behind bulk of the nlr gas .",
    "the nlr gas left behind will retain memory of the original ionization from the pre - merger accretion phase for only limited time , given by the light - travel time , and the hydrogen recombination timescale , @xmath30 yr , where @xmath31 is the gas temperature in 10@xmath32 k , and @xmath33 is the gas density in units of 10@xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "[ oiii ] will fade away more quickly than hydrogen lines ( binette & robinson 1987 ) .",
    "however , once the recoiling smbh re - forms its inner accretion disk , it will re - illuminate parts of the nlr left behind ( from larger distance than before ) , and any surrounding ism .",
    "emission - line ratios would depend on the average density which would be higher in the classical nlr than in other ism / halo gas , and on metal abundances which will be lower in the halo .",
    "which aspects of this scenario do we observe in sdssj0927 + 2943 ? the blue system of emission - lines , the bels and b - nels , represents gas bound to the recoiling smbh , seen in broad balmer lines , broad mgii and broad forbidden lines , especially [ nev ] .",
    "after coalescence and recoil , matter orbiting the smbh with a velocity much larger than the recoil velocity will remain bound to the smbh ( merritt et al .",
    "2006 ) ; i.e. matter within a region whose size is given by @xmath36 .",
    "in our case , @xmath37 cm , which is about a factor of 3 larger than the blr of sdssj0927 + 2943 .",
    "the width of [ neiii ] ( of the b - nel system ) of 1020 kms@xmath0 is too narrow for this gas to be originally bound to the smbh ( except in case of projection effects ) , but as the disk keeps accreting onto the recoiling smbh , it will spread radially , and will also drive some outflows . the semi - broad [ oii ] and [ oiii ] most likely have this same origin , and/or are from swept - up ism in front of the path of the recoiling smbh emission from the gas bound to the recoiling smbh ; even though shielding geometries might be constructed in which this actually becomes possible . ] .",
    "the red system of emission lines , the r - nels , represents the nlr gas left behind , and/or ism surrounding the recoiling smbh , not bound to it , but illuminated by its accretion disk .",
    "all r - nels have the same profiles and are very narrow , and the emission - line ratios imply an agn ionizing continuum .",
    "can we distinguish between nlr and other ism / halo gas , in terms of line ratios and line profiles ?",
    "ratios _ would depend on density and distance . as the recoiling",
    "smbh moves away from the galaxy core , illumination of the nlr from an , on average larger , distance would decrease the degree of ionization , while illumination of low - density ism surrounding the recoiling smbh would increase the degree of ionization of the line - emitting gas .",
    "it is possible that we see a mix of these two processes .",
    "we do not expect to see pure very low - density halo gas .",
    "its high ionization parameter would lead to a much higher degree of ionization than we actually observe , as we have also verified by test calculations with ferland s photoionization code _ cloudy _",
    "( s. komossa et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the density - sensitive [ sii ] doublet is outside the observed wave band , but will be accessible with nir spectroscopy .",
    "independent evidence for the origin of the r - nels comes from their _ profiles _ which are very narrow .",
    "their width is below the stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath38=260 kms@xmath0 predicted from the @xmath39 relation ( ferrarese & ford 2005 ) .",
    "this indicates that the r - nel gas illuminated by the recoiling smbh either does not feel the full bulge potential , or the local velocity field of the illuminated gas does not reflect the full velocity dispersion .",
    "this latter situation is expected if the recoiling smbh was in a disk where the velocity pattern is predominantly rotational , so that we only see a fraction of the full pattern .",
    "the whole parameter space of bh recoil velocities is still being explored ( e.g. , baker et al . 2006 , 2007 , campanelli et al . 2007a , b , choi et al .",

    "2008 , and references therein ; see pretorius 2007 for a review ) .",
    "several recent calculations focused on ( almost ) equal mass bhs with specific spin configurations such that kick velocities are maximized .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity we measure is comparable to the recoil velocities predicted by the runs of gonzles et al .",

    "( 2007a ) and of baker et al .",
    "( 2008 ) predict maximal recoil velocities of @xmath193800 kms@xmath0 . in order to reach a high kick velocity ,",
    "the pre - merger bhs of sdssj0927 + 2943 must have been rapidly spinning and of nearly equal mass ; i.e. the galaxy hosting sdssj0927 + 2943 must have undergone a major merger .",
    "assuming that the recoiling smbh carried with it an amount of mass which is not larger than its own mass , and that most of that gas is ultimately available for accretion , we can estimate an upper limit on the duration of the quasar activity , @xmath41 .",
    "we further assume that the gas continues to accrete at its current rate of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the eddington luminosity , and we use a radiative efficiency of @xmath44=0.37 which is appropriate for rapidly spinning bhs .",
    "this implies an upper limit on the lifetime of quasar activity of @xmath45 yr . if the space velocity of the recoiling smbh was close to the maximum possible velocity , it would reach a projected separation from the core on the order of a few kiloparsec within @xmath1910@xmath46 yr .",
    "future _ hst _ imaging of sdssj0927 + 2943 will be valuable to distinguish whether the host galaxy shows a distorted morphology as would be expected if the merger was recent .",
    "with its spatial resolution of 0.1@xmath28 , _ hst _ would allow resolution of a spatial scale of @xmath191 kpc in the galaxy and measurement of a corresponding offset of the accreting smbh from the galaxy core .",
    "the x - ray detection of sdssj0927 + 2943 holds promise for a deep _ chandra _ study of smbh and host galaxy .",
    "if the recoiling smbh is a radio emitter , high - resolution radio observations would provide even more precise measurement of its location .    in summary , sdssj0927 + 2943",
    "is the best candidate to date for a recoiling supermassive black hole .",
    "its spectrum shows the characteristic signature of two separate emission - line systems , kinematically offset by @xmath192650 kms@xmath0  broad lines from gas bound to the recoiling hole , and narrow lines from gas left behind .",
    "further study of this source and detection of similar ones will provide important information on bh recoil , relevant timescales , and the frequency of bhs removed from their host galaxies , and therefore on simulations of galaxy formation and evolution , and on the question how many bhs grew early by merging ."
