    "all luminous red giants appear to be variables and they are generally known as long period variables(lpvs ) .",
    "they vary with periods which fall on at least eight period - luminosity sequences which have been labeled a@xmath6 , a , b , c@xmath6 , c , d , e and f ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "sequences a@xmath6-c and f are thought to consist of stars pulsating in the radial fundamental and overtone modes and the non - radial dipole and quadrupole modes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these stars have been classified as miras , semi - regulars(srs ) and ogle small amplitude red giants ( osargs ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "sequence e is known to consist of close binary system showing ellipsoidal and eclipsing variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the last sequence , called sequence d , exhibits the longest periods of all the sequences .",
    "sequence d stars show photometric variations with periods of @xmath74001500 days and they also show another variations with a shorter period that usually correspond to the period of sequence b. in these stars , the shorter period is called the primary period and the longer period corresponding to sequence d is known as a long secondary period ( lsp ) .",
    "lsp stars have been found within the lmc , smc and galactic populations of lpvs .",
    "in fact , approximately 25 - 50@xmath8 of luminous red giants have been found to show lsps in macho and ogle data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the origin of the lsp phenomenon is still unknown and many explanations have been suggested . some of these are now highlighted .",
    "the most straightforward explanation is pulsation .",
    "however , all pulsation explanations have problems .",
    "since , at the given luminosity , the typical lsp is approximately 4 times longer than the period of a mira ( on sequence c ) , and since the miras are known to be pulsating in the radial fundamental mode , an explanation in terms of normal - mode radial pulsation is not possible .",
    "non - radial g - mode pulsation was proposed as the explanation of the lsp phenomenon by @xcite since g - mode periods can be longer than the radial fundamental mode period . however , because red giants have a large convective envelope and only a thin outer radiative layer where g - modes could develop , the amplitude of g - modes should be too small to correspond to the observed light and radial velocity amplitudes of lsp stars @xcite .",
    "some researchers have also argued for a close binary hypothesis ( like sequence e ) to explain the lsp phenomenon . @xcite found at least 5@xmath8 of lsp stars showed ellipsoidal or eclipse - like variability .",
    "he also noted , as did @xcite , that if the sequence e ellipsoidal variable were plotted using the orbital period rather than the photometric period ( half the orbital period ) then sequences d and e overlapped on the period - luminosity diagram .",
    "however , the large amplitude of many lsp light curves ( up to 1 magnitude ) would require a close pair of eclipsing red giants , very unlikely in itself , and this would lead to alternating deep and shallow minima which are not seen . on the other hand , @xcite found that many light curves due to the lsps show faster decline and slower rise and they proposed that a binary with a companion surrounded by a comet - shaped cloud of gas and dust could give rise to those light curve features .",
    "various observational and numerical results have conflicted with the binary hypothesis . @xcite",
    "observed radial velocity variations in six local red giants with lsps and found that the velocity curves all had a similar shape . for eccentric binaries with a random longitude of periastron , the light curve shape should vary from star to star .",
    "the lack of such variability led @xcite to reject the binary explanation for lsps .",
    "@xcite and @xcite obtained radial velocity curves for stars in the galaxy and lmc and they argued that the small typical full velocity amplitude of @xmath73.5 km s@xmath9 meant that all binary companions would need a mass near 0.09@xmath10 . since companions of this mass are rare around main - sequence stars , it seems unlikely that the 2550% of red giants which show lsps could have a companion of this mass .",
    "star spots due to magnetic activity on agb stars have been proposed by some researchers ( e.g. @xcite ) and a rotating spotted star has been suggested as an explanation of the lsps .",
    "possible evidence for magnetic activity in stars with lsps is provided by the existence of h@xmath11 absorption lines whose strength varies with the lsp @xcite . however , from observations , @xcite found that the rotation velocity of lsp stars is typically less than 3 km / s and they noted that this rotation velocity is too small to explain the periods of less than 1000 days which are often observed for the lsp .",
    "for example , a 3 km / s rotation velocity gives rise to the period of 2868 days for an agb star with a @xmath7170 @xmath12 . a way to overcome this objection would be to have multiple star spots . in another study",
    ", @xcite found that with a simple blackbody model , it was difficult for a rotating spotted star to simultaneously reproduce both the amplitude and colour variation observed in the macho observations of stars with lsps .",
    "the use of model atmospheres rather than blackbodies , and allowing for limb darkening , could alter this conclusion .",
    "the giant convective cell model is a relatively new explanation of the lsp phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this model is somewhat similar to the rotating spot model in that it involves variable amounts of the visible stellar surface having a temperature cooler than normal .",
    "the photometric variations seen in both the rotating spot model and the giant convective cell model should be similar .",
    "another potential origin for the lsp is a variable amount of circumstellar dust .",
    "@xcite proposed that the periodic dust formation found in the circumstellar regions of theoretical models of agb stars by @xcite and @xcite could give rise to the light variation of the lsps .",
    "evidence for dust around red giants with lsps was found by @xcite who showed that lsp stars tend to have a mid - infrared excess .",
    "on near- to mid - infrared color - magnitude diagrams , the lsp stars lie in a region similar to that occupied by r coronae borealis stars which are known to be surrounded by patchy circumstellar dust clouds .",
    "this result suggests that the variation of lsp stars might be due to the ejection of dust shells that may be patchy .",
    "similarly , in studying the effect of dust ejection on macho colours and magnitudes , @xcite noted that patchy dust clouds seemed to be required in order to reproduce the observed colour - magnitude variations .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize new long - term near - infrared @xmath13 light curves of stars in the smc obtained with the sirius camera on the irsf 1.4 m telescope @xcite .",
    "we combine the @xmath13 observations with @xmath1 and @xmath2 monitoring of smc stars by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) @xcite .",
    "using this combined data , we examine light and colour variations of lsp stars over a wide wavelength range .",
    "we then test models involving dust ejection or variable spots to see if they can reproduce the observed light and colour variations over the wide wavelength range . for our computations , the dusty code ( @xcite ) is used to model the effects of ejected dust and the 2012 version of the wilson - devinney code @xcite is used to model the effects on the light and colour of a spotted star .",
    "a long - term multi - band near - infrared photometric survey for variable stars in the large and small magellanic clouds has been carried out at the south african astronomical observatory at sutherland @xcite . the sirius camera attached to the irsf 1.4 m telescope",
    "was used for this survey and more than 10 years of observations in the near - ir bands @xmath4(1.25@xmath14 m ) , @xmath15(1.63@xmath14 m ) and @xmath16(2.14@xmath14 m ) band were obtained . in this work , we select the smc stars from the sirius database .",
    "variable and non - variable stars in an area of 1 square degree in the central part of the smc have been observed about 99 - 126 times in the period 20012012 and a total of 340147 , 301841 and 215463 sources were identified in @xmath4 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "we note that the photometric detection range of the sirius camera is about 8@xmath718 magnitudes in k@xmath18 band .",
    "a total of 12008 variable sources of all kinds were detected of which 4533 were detected in all three wavebands ( data release ver 130501 .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath1 and @xmath2 band time series of smc red giants from the ogle project @xcite .",
    "typically , about 1000 observing points were obtained in the @xmath2 band by ogle - ii+iii while a much smaller number of about 5070 points were obtained in the @xmath1 band .",
    "@xcite divided the lpvs into lsp and non - lsp stars according to their positions in the period - luminosity relations for variable red giants .",
    "we found nearly 700 lsp stars in the area of the irsf infrared survey . in order to determine",
    "if an lsp star is oxygen - rich or carbon - rich , we initially adopted the classification method introduced by @xcite .",
    "the stars we examined in detail had their oxygen - rich or carbon - rich status checked against optical spectral classifications in the literature .      by combining the sirius data with the ogle data",
    ", we obtained 298 oxygen - rich lsp stars and 88 carbon - rich lsp stars in the region monitored by the sirius camera .",
    "for all sample stars , a small number of apparent bad data points were removed from each time series .",
    "then , by using a first order fourier fit to the @xmath2 band time series , we obtained the period and amplitude corresponding to the largest amplitude mode of the light curves . in all cases ,",
    "the obtained periods and amplitudes were almost identical to those in the ogle - iii catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "using the period from the fit to the @xmath2 light curve , a fit was also made to the @xmath17 light curve in order to derive its amplitude .",
    "since our aim is to look for and to model colour and magnitude changes , we need the observed changes to be significantly larger than the noise in the data .",
    "the limiting factor in this study is noise in the near - ir data .",
    "we concentrate on the brightest stars with @xmath19 and for them the useful lower limit for clearly apparent @xmath17 band variation is about 0.04 magnitudes .",
    "similarly , we set a useful lower limit for @xmath2 band variation of about 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "figure[iamp_kamp ] shows the full amplitude of the observed lsp stars in the @xmath2 and @xmath16 bands .",
    "this figure shows the selected stars , which having full amplitudes larger than 0.04 magnitudes in @xmath17 and 0.2 magnitudes in @xmath2 .",
    "this selection gave us a sample of 7 oxygen - rich stars and 14 carbon stars for analysis .",
    "the spectral types of our sample stars obtained from the ogle photometry agree with the classifications in the simbad astronomical database where the spectral types were obtained from spectroscopic determinations .",
    "the properties of these stars at maximum light are listed in table  [ tab01 ] .    near infrared @xmath13",

    "we have examined broadband observations of samples of oxygen - rich and carbon stars in the smc which exhibit lsp light variations .",
    "the observations are in the @xmath20 bands and they were obtained by the ogle project and by the sirius camera of the irsf 1.4 m telescope .    the @xmath4 and @xmath17 observations of oxygen - rich stars reveal a significant new feature of lsp light variations . as light declines ,",
    "the @xmath21 colour barely changes or sometimes gets bluer .",
    "we interpret this as indicating that cool gas containing a significant amount of h@xmath22o is levitated above the photosphere of lsp stars at the beginning of light decline .",
    "absorption of light in the @xmath17 band by h@xmath22o forces the @xmath21 colour to remain constant or to get bluer during light decline .",
    "the levitation of matter above the photosphere found here , along with the discovery of the development of a warm chromosphere during rising light by @xcite , provides strong evidence that the lsp phenomenon is associated with mass ejection from the photosphere of red giant stars .",
    "we examined two possible models for the explanation of the lsp phenomenon by comparing these models with broadband observations of both oxygen - rich and carbon stars .",
    "the first model assumes lsp light variations are due to dust absorption by ejected dust shells while the second model assumes a rotating star with a dark spot .    in the dust shell ejection model for lsp stars ,",
    "it was found that dust absorption by the ejected mass shell could not explain the observed variations in the ( @xmath2,@xmath23 ) or ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) diagrams for either oxygen - rich or carbon stars . in oxygen - rich stars ,",
    "the models fail to reproduce the variations in the ( @xmath2,@xmath23 ) because the models only include variable dust absorption and not the variable h@xmath22o absorption noted above .",
    "the failure of the dust shell models to reproduce the observed variations in the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) diagram for either oxygen - rich or carbon stars , and the failure to reproduce the observed variations in the ( @xmath2,@xmath23 ) diagram for carbon stars , suggests that dust absorption in ejected mass shells is not the cause of lsp light variations .",
    "the lsp model involving a rotating , spotted star was not able to reproduce the observed variations in oxygen - rich stars in either the ( @xmath2,@xmath24 ) or ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) diagrams ( or the @xmath2,@xmath21 diagram , but here the @xmath21 colour is affected by h@xmath22o absorption that is not included in the models ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the rotating , spotted star model is not the explanation for lsp light variations either .",
    "this result strengthens the conclusion of @xcite that the rotation periods of lsp stars are too long for a spotted star model to explain lsp variations .",
    "a simple combined dust and spotted star model was no better at explaining the observed magnitude - colour variations than the dust and spotted star models individually .",
    "our conclusion is that some process other than dust shell ejection or spot rotation lies behind the light variations seen in stars with lsps .",
    "this unknown process seems to be responsible for the ejection of matter near the beginning of light decline .",
    "the ejected matter may be the origin of the excess mid - infrared emission due to dust that is seen in stars with lsps @xcite .",
