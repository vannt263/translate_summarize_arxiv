    "most of the couplings between the @xmath18-th and @xmath97-th modes ( and @xmath99 ) are negative .",
    "these are because the localized loss tends to apply to the fluctuation force on all of the modes to the same direction around itself .",
    "equation ( [ g_q_n_q_k ] ) indicates that the sign of the correlation , @xmath78 , is the same as that of the coupling , @xmath36 , below the first resonance . in this frequency band ,",
    "the thermal motion is larger and smaller than the evaluation of the traditional modal expansion if the dissipation is near and far from the observation area , respectively .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the qualitative discussion of levin @xcite , our previous calculation of the mirror @xcite , and the drum experiment @xcite .",
    "the above consideration about the sign of the coupling gives a clue to solving the inverse problem : estimations of the distribution and frequency dependences of the loss from the measurement of the thermal motion .",
    "since the sign of the coupling depends on the position of the observation area and the loss distribution , a measurement of the thermal vibrations at multiple points provides information about the couplings , i.e. the loss distribution . moreover , multiple - point measurements reveal the loss frequency dependence .",
    "even if the loss is uniform , the difference between the actual thermal motion and the traditional modal expansion exits when the expected frequency dependence of the loss angles , @xmath100 , is not correct @xcite .",
    "the measurement at the multiple points shows whether the observed difference is due to an inhomogeneous loss or an invalid loss angle .",
    "this is because the sign of the difference is independent of the position of the observation area if the expected loss angles are not valid .",
    "as an example , our leaf - spring experiment @xcite is discussed .",
    "the two graphs on the right ( or left ) side of fig .",
    "[ experiment ] show thermal fluctuations at different positions in the same mechanical system . the spectrum is smaller than the traditional modal expansion .",
    "the other one is larger .",
    "thus , the disagreement in the leaf - spring experiment was due to inhomogeneous loss , not invalid loss angles .",
    "when the power spectrum had a dip between the first ( 60 hz ) and second ( 360 hz ) modes , the sign of the correlation , @xmath101 , was negative . according to eq .",
    "( [ g_q_n_q_k ] ) , the sign of the coupling , @xmath102 , was positive .",
    "the loss was concentrated near to the observation point when a spectrum dip was found .",
    "the above conclusion agrees with the actual loss shown in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] .",
    "the traditional modal expansion has frequently been used to evaluate the thermal noise of mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental research @xcite has proved that this method is invalid when the mechanical dissipation is distributed inhomogeneously . in this paper",
    ", we introduced a modification of the modal expansion @xcite . according to this method ( the advanced modal expansion ) , inhomogeneous loss causes correlations between the thermal fluctuations of the modes .",
    "the fault of the traditional modal expansion is that these correlations are not taken into account .",
    "our previous experiments @xcite concerning the thermal noise of the inhomogeneous loss support the advanced modal expansion .",
    "the advanced modal expansion gives interesting physical insight about the difference between the actual thermal noise and the traditional modal expansion .",
    "when the thermal noise consists of the contributions of many modes , the loss is localized in a narrower area , which makes a larger difference . when the thermal noise is dominated by only one mode ,",
    "this difference is small , even if the loss is extremely inhomogeneous .",
    "the sign of this difference depends on the frequency , the distribution of the loss , and the position of the observation area .",
    "it is possible to derive the distribution and frequency dependence of the loss from measurements of the thermal vibrations at multiple points .",
    "there were many problems concerning the thermal noise caused by inhomogeneous loss .",
    "our previous work @xcite and this research solved almost all of these problems : a modification of the traditional estimation method ( in this paper ) , experimental checks of the new and traditional estimation methods and a confirmation of the new methods ( @xcite and this paper ) , an evaluation of the thermal noise of the gravitational wave detector using the new method @xcite , and a consideration of the physical properties of the discrepancy between the actual thermal noise and the traditional estimation method ( in this paper ) .",
    "this research was supported in part by research fellowships of the japan society for the promotion of science for young scientists , and by a grant - in - aid for creative basic research of the ministry of education .                                                      within the optics community ,",
