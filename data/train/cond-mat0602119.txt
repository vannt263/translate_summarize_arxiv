    "vortex phase diagram of spinor condensates is very rich , since the order parameter has three components in @xmath0 case and five components in @xmath2 case .",
    "topological excitations in spinor condensates were studied theoretically in a large number of articles see , e.g. , refs mizushima1,isoshima1,reijnders , ueda1,pogosov .    at the same time , an interest is now growing to temperature effects in atomic condensates .",
    "@xcite study theoretically the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition associated with the proliferation of thermally - excited vortex - antivortex pairs . for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in quasi two - dimensional condensates bkt transition can occur at rather low temperatures , @xmath3 , at number of particles in the system @xmath4 .",
    "recently , some signatures of possible bkt phase were also found close to the critical temperature @xmath5 in experimental work bktexper , where condensates in optical lattice have been studied .",
    "finally , experimental evidence for the bkt transition in trapped condensates was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite deal with the thermal fluctuations of positions of vortices in rotated scalar condensates .",
    "note that , according to the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem , bose - einstein condensation is not possible in 2d homogeneous systems .",
    "however , application of the trapping potential leads to the macroscopic occupation of the ground state of bose gas .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the effect of thermal fluctuations in rotated quasi two - dimensional _ spinor _ condensates .",
    "these systems have a specific degree of freedom , associated with the relative angle among different components of the order parameter corresponding to different hyperfine state .",
    "in other words , this angle determines coherence among components of the order parameter .",
    "also it influences a transverse magnetization of the condensate . in this paper , we focus on thermal fluctuations of this angle .",
    "note that experimentally , at present time , it is possible to study the condensate phase @xcite , see also ref @xcite .",
    "in addition , recently , a new and nondestructive method for measuring the local magnetization of the condensate was proposed and successfully applied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we show that the relative angle among hyperfine components of the order parameter in 2d case can experience strong thermal fluctuation even at low temperatures .",
    "the reason is the weakness of the spin energy of the system as compared to interactions in density channel .",
    "also fluctuations of this angle lead to significant relative fluctuations of the local transverse magnetization of the condensate , which are much larger in the antiferromagnetic case than in the ferromagnetic one .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a basic formulation of the problem . in section",
    "ii , we discuss our main results for the fluctuations of angle and spin textures .",
    "we conclude in section iii .",
    "we consider harmonically - trapped quasi 2d bose - einstein condensate with spin @xmath0 .",
    "the trapping potential is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a trapping frequency , @xmath8 is the mass of the atom , and @xmath9 is the radial coordinate .",
    "the system is rotated with the angular velocity @xmath10 , well below the critical rotation speed @xmath11 , and the number of atoms in the cloud is @xmath12 . in this paper , we restrict ourselves on the range of temperatures much smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , we can neglect a noncondensate contribution to the free energy of the cloud .",

    "@xmath35 , since @xmath36 .",
    "typically , @xmath37 , and this ratio can be tuned . in this paper , we study the case of relatively dilute condensate and take @xmath38 .",
    "we will consider different values of @xmath12 but at fixed value of interaction parameter @xmath28 .",
    "this is possible , since , in the case of a single layer cloud , we can always tune the trapping frequency in the longitudinal direction keeping @xmath28  constant . to ensure the regime of quasi - two - dimensionality , we can also tune @xmath7 . in this case",
    ", we have to change the rotation speed to keep the dimensionless rotation speed the same , and the themperature to fix dimensionless @xmath39 . in real atomic condensates",
    ", @xmath40 is approximately several nanometers .",
    "the most realistic value of @xmath12 for this @xmath28 is close to @xmath41 , and to illustrate the effect of @xmath12 we will consider the following range : @xmath42 .",
    "the total magnetization of the condensate is fixed :    @xmath43    magnetization @xmath44 is normalized in terms of @xmath12 and maximum of @xmath45 is equal to 1 .",
    "one has also to take into account the normalization condition for the order parameter :    @xmath46    the spatial profiles of all the components of the order parameter in the equilibrium can be found from the condition of minimum of energy ( 4 ) .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the longitudinal @xmath47 and transverse @xmath48 local magnetizations of the condensate :    @xmath49    @xmath50    the spin energy in this case can be represented as @xmath51    in this paper , we restrict ourselves only to the case of axially - symmetric phases , when moduli of all the components of the order parameter are independent on the azimuthal angle and depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath52 . note that equilibrium vortex phases in this situation were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite for the spin @xmath0 condensate and in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath2 system . for the axially - symmetric phases ,",
    "each component of the order parameter can be represented as @xmath53where @xmath54 is a polar angle , @xmath55  is a winding number , and @xmath56 is a relative phase .",

    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , the spin energy depends on relative angle @xmath61    it is important to note that only a spin contribution to the total energy ( 4 ) depends on phases @xmath62 via the spin - mixing term . for the stationary state , which is a local minimum of gross - pitaevskii functional ( 4 ) ,",
    "the value of @xmath63 is determined by the sign of interaction constant in a spin channel @xmath64 . for positive @xmath64 ( antiferromagnetic case ) ,",
    "a minimum of @xmath65 is attained at @xmath66 , whereas for negative @xmath67 ( ferromagnetic case ) @xmath68 .",
    "according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , for the antiferromagnetic state ( @xmath69 ) , phases ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) and ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) are energetically favorable in the region of small and moderate values of magnetization @xmath44 .",
    "phase ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) is realized at low rotation frequencies @xmath70 and ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) at higher @xmath70 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) state is favorable in the ferromagnetic case ( @xmath71 ) in a region of moderate values of @xmath70 and @xmath72 in these phases , all three hypefine states are populated .",
    "fluctuations of @xmath63 have a sense only in this case , since the @xmath63-dependent part of the energy is equal to zero identically , if one of the components of the order parameter is zero . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on these three vortex states , since they are appropriate candidates for the illustration of the effect of thermal fluctuations .",
    "note that in homogeneous spin-1 condensate atoms populate only two or one hyperfine state(s ) ; they can populate three states only if the system is trapped and experiences rotation , which generates vortices .",
    "an important feature of real atomic spinor bose - einstein condensates is a weakness of the spin interactions comparing to the interaction in density channel ( @xmath73 ) . at the same time",
    ", the coherence among the different components of the order parameter ( angle @xmath63 ) is fully determined by the spin interaction .",
    "angle @xmath63 also influences the transverse magnetization of the condensate , as seen from eq . (",
    "note that a longitudinal component of magnetization is independent on @xmath63 .",
    "smallness of @xmath64 comparing to @xmath28 leads to the fact that thermal fluctuations of relative angle @xmath63 become significant at much lower temperatures than fluctuations of the density of particles .",
    "therefore , at relatively low temperatures , one can assume that the moduli of all the components of the order parameter remain fixed ( that can be also checked numerically ) , whereas @xmath63 is fluctuating . for the case of small fluctuations of @xmath63 , one can use a harmonic approximation and represent the deviation of the energy of the system from the equilibrium , @xmath74 , as a quadratic function in terms of the deviation of angle @xmath63 from the equilibrium @xmath75 :",
    "@xmath76where @xmath77 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the average square of the deviation of @xmath63 from the equilibrium is given by    @xmath78    integrals in eq .",
    "( 15 ) can be calculated analytically . after taking into account eq .",
    "( 3 ) , we get:@xmath79we also introduce a quantity @xmath80 , which can be considered as an average deviation of angle @xmath63 from the equilibrium .",
    "we see that @xmath81 depends on dimensionless temperature @xmath82 , the number of particles @xmath12 and integral @xmath83 . for a given vortex phase ,",
    "@xmath83 is also a function of total magnetization @xmath44 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the scaling relation ( 16 ) has a sense only if @xmath28 is independent of @xmath12 , as discussed above . in order to calculate @xmath83",
    ", we use a variational method , which was previously applied by us in ref .",
    "@xcite to evaluate energies of various axially - symmetric vortex phases in spin @xmath2 condensate . in this approach , each component of the order parameter is modeled by a trial function and values of variational parameters are found from the condition of minimum of total energy .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot calculated dependence of @xmath81 ( measured in degrees ) as a function of the number of particles in the system for different vortex phases at @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this value of @xmath28 is close to typical experimental ones ( @xmath86 nm , @xmath87 nm@xmath88 ) , see also calculations of ref .",
    "we assume that , for ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) and ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) states , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , whereas for ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 for the particular phase is independent on @xmath70 , since @xmath83 has the same property .",
    "we see that even for quite low temperatures , @xmath94 can be rather large and the coherence among different components of the order parameter is practically destroyed . for smaller value of @xmath95 ,",
    "fluctuations of @xmath63 are , of course , even stronger . to illustrate the effect of temperature , in the inset to fig . 1",
    ", we show the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath96 for ( 0 , 1 , 2)-phase ( curve 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) phase ( curve 2 ) , and ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) phase ( curve 3 ) at fixed number of atoms @xmath97 , @xmath98 for the first curve and @xmath99 for two others .",
    "note that @xmath81 is almost independent on total magnetization @xmath44 of the condensate .",
    "as we already pointed out , fluctuations of @xmath63 lead to that of @xmath48 . in a harmonic approximation , one can express the average deviation of @xmath100 from the equilibrium @xmath101 through the deviation of @xmath102 :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 for the antiferromagnetic case and @xmath105 for the ferromagnetic one .",
    "if in the antiferromagnetic state the total magnetization is not large , @xmath106 , one can expect that @xmath107 , and , therefore , even small fluctuations of @xmath63 lead to strong relative fluctuations of @xmath108 . at the same time , for ferromagnetic case , @xmath105 in this equation , and relative fluctuations of @xmath100 are much smaller .",
    "we have calculated @xmath109 for different vortex phases and our calculations revealed that @xmath110 is almost independent on radial coordinate @xmath9 for vortex phases ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) and ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath111 for these states , therefore , @xmath112 is nearly proportional to @xmath113 , and , according to eq .",
    "( 15 ) , @xmath114 should only slightly depend on @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "2 we present @xmath115 as a function of total magnetization of the condensate for ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) state at @xmath84 , @xmath89 ( antiferromagnetic case ) , and @xmath116 .",
    "we see that relative fluctuations of transverse magnetization can be significant even at low temperature .",
    "value of @xmath115 decreases with increase of @xmath44 .",
    "this result is natural , since condensate becomes more polarized with growing @xmath44 .",
    "an absolute value of @xmath109 also remains sizable .",
    "although value of fractional quantity @xmath115 is growing with decreasing of @xmath44 , the value of @xmath108 itself becomes smaller .",
    "therefore , we found that the most appropriate values of @xmath44 to observe fluctuations of transverse magnetization is around @xmath117 , where both @xmath118 and @xmath108 are high : @xmath119 , whereas @xmath48 is comparable to the longitudinal magnetization @xmath47 in the fully polarized state at @xmath120 , where it should be easily detectable experimentally .",
    "value of @xmath118 depends also on the vortex phase ; we found that in ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) state it is even much larger than in ( -1 , 0 , 1 ) state .",
    "also we have calculated @xmath109 for the ferromagnetic ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) phase . as can be expected , in this case , relative fluctuations of @xmath121 are much weaker .",
    "physically , this is because @xmath121 is proportional to the ferromagnetic order parameter @xcite , which is responsible for the ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "therefore , one can expect that in the ferromagnetic phase this order parameter is more robust with respect to thermal fluctuations , than in the antiferromagnetic one .",
    "in addition , average deviation of @xmath121 from the equilibrium is negative and its modulus is growing with increase of @xmath44 , in contrast to the antiferromagnetic system .",
    "thermal fluctuations should also be important in the case of @xmath2 condensate , where there are two interaction constants in spin channel and two characteristic angles .",
    "therefore , one can expect more complicated behavior , as compared to @xmath0 condensate .",
    "for instance , in homogeneous @xmath2 system , a cyclic state can have a lowest energy ; in this case atoms populate three hyperfine states , and the spin energy depends on the coherence among them .",
    "fluctuation problem for this system was analyzed in ref .",
    "a new method to create such entangled states in spin-1 condensate was recently applied experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a microwave energy was injected to the system . as a result , particles redistribute from spin @xmath122 state to spin @xmath123 and @xmath124 states , and all three magnetic sublevels become populated . the spin - mixing dynamics in @xmath0 condensate was studied theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that in eq .",
    "( 14 ) we have assumed that fluctuating @xmath63 is spatially independent that is not true in general case",
    ". however , spatial gradients of @xmath102 give some additional contribution to the kinetic energy of the system , which is much larger than the spin energy . therefore , gradients of @xmath102  result in rather large increase of total energy , and we can neglect them for the trapped system , at least for our range of parameters . in other words ,",
    "healing length for @xmath63 far exceeds the thomas - fermi radius of the system , and , therefore , although @xmath63 is fluctuating inside the cloud , it remains nearly constant @xcite , except of the surface layer , where the density of particles is low .",
    "thermal fluctuations of @xmath63 should be also noticeable in three - dimensional condensates at low and moderate temperatures .",
    "in general , the dependences of the number of condensed particles on the reduced temperature and critical temperature on the total number of atoms for 3d case are similar to that in 2d system , which are described by eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "the main difference is the powers of @xmath39 and @xmath12 in the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) that are @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) , respectively .",
    "however , in this case one has to take accurately into account the possibility of long wave length fluctuations of @xmath102 in longitudinal direction and formation of kinks @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the effect of thermal fluctuations on the coherence among different components of the order parameter in quasi 2d rotating @xmath0 bose - einstein condensate , when all three hyperfine states are populated .",
    "different axially - symmetric vortex phases were considered .",
    "we have shown that the deviation of the relative phase @xmath128 from the equilibrium can be very significant even at low temperatures , much smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "fluctuations of relative angle induce sizable fluctuations of the spin texture , namely , local transverse magnetization of the condensate .",
    "we have shown that these fluctuations are much more pronounced in antiferromagnetic case than in the ferromagnetic one .",
    "the recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite direct and nondestuctive method for the imaging of spinor bec spatial magnetization ( or some of its modification ) can be applied for the experimental study of the thermal fluctuations of spin textures , since it enables multiple - shot imaging and one can directly observe the dynamics of a single sample .",
