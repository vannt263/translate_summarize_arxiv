    "extragalactic surveys have dramatically advanced over the past five years , largely due to the flood of data from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( hereafter ) and the _ x - ray multi - mirror mission - newton _ ( hereafter ) .",
    "the superb mirrors and charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detectors on these observatories provide large source samples detected to flux levels that are up to times lower than those of previous missions .",
    "they furthermore provide high - quality source positions with accuracies of , allowing reliable matching to multiwavelength counterparts .",
    "about 40 extragalactic surveys are presently underway utilizing data from  and .",
    "while a broad diversity of sources are found in  and   surveys , it is clear that the majority of the detected sources are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "in fact , deep  and  surveys have found the highest agn sky densities to date , reaching @xmath1  deg@xmath2 ( e.g. , bauer et  al .",
    "surveys appear to have excellent , although not perfect , completeness when compared to other multiwavelength methods for finding agn .",
    "many of the agn found in  and  surveys are faint at optical and other wavelengths , often having @xmath3 magnitudes of 2327 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "they also often have modest optical luminosities so that , without superb imaging from space , there is substantial blending of the light from the agn and its host galaxy .",
    "thus , sensitive and high - resolution imaging at multiple wavelengths and over relatively large fields is required for optimal follow - up studies .",
    "such imaging has typically lagged behind the data due to observational expense , but the _ joint dark energy mission _",
    "( ) would dramatically reverse this situation , likely leaving astronomers scrambling to `` catch up . ''",
    "below i will briefly describe a few exciting science projects that would be enabled by combining data from  and missions such as , , , , , , , and .",
    "i will focus on agn - driven science as agn are the numerically dominant source population in extragalactic surveys .",
    "however , wonderful / science should also be possible for clusters and groups of galaxies , large - scale structures , starburst galaxies , normal galaxies , and other classes of objects .",
    "deep optical variability surveys are one of the only methods competitive with surveys at efficiently finding high sky densities of agn . for example , sarajedini et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) report the discovery of 16 variable galactic nuclei in the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) based on analyses of two  @xmath4-band images taken five years apart ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the derived agn sky density is in the range @xmath511,000  deg@xmath2 .",
    "the precise sky density depends upon the amount of contamination by nuclear supernovae and statistical outliers , but it is clearly higher than that from most optical spectroscopic surveys and is plausibly comparable to that from the deepest surveys ( see  1 ) .",
    "while selection and optical variability selection have respectable overlap in the agn found ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , each method also finds agn missed by the other .",
    "for example , there are at least 23 agn in the hdf - n not identified by sarajedini et  al .",
    "conversely , at least some of the variable galactic nuclei of sarajedini et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) may be weak agn lying below the detection threshold of even the 2  ms cdf - n exposure",
    ". these agn might be weak due to a low bolometric power , or they might have emaciated accretion - disk coronae that can not produce effectively .",
    "as currently planned ,  should find at least 30,00090,000 variability selected agn in its 15  deg@xmath6 deep survey .",
    "an even larger number of agn should be found in its wider surveys .",
    "if appropriately matched data were obtained ( see  6 ) , joint  and techniques could be applied to generate the largest and most complete census of moderate - luminosity , typical agn out to high redshift .",
    "sources could be scrutinized especially carefully for optically variable nuclei in the  data , and stacking techniques could be used to study the average properties of agn not detected individually .",
    "the large solid angle coverage would allow the agn population to be probed consistently over a wide range of luminosity ; the present data have poor coverage of luminous , rare agn .",
    "x - ray surveys , mainly with , have discovered about seven large - amplitude outbursts from galactic nuclei ( e.g. , donley et  al . 2002 ; komossa 2002 ; vaughan et  al .",
    "these events have variability amplitudes of 50400 or more , peak luminosities comparable to those of local seyfert galaxies , soft spectra , and decay timescales of months to years ( see fig .",
    "they are observed in both inactive and active galaxies . in inactive galaxies",
    "the event rate is @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , while in active galaxies the event rate appears to be @xmath9 times higher .",
    "these outbursts are probably associated with transient fueling events of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) .",
    "fueling may occur when a star or planet is tidally disrupted , or in some cases it may be due to accretion - disk instabilities .",
    "observations should allow the discovery of additional outbursts from galactic nuclei .",
    "the outbursts above are plausibly expected to induce accompanying optical variability , and there is direct evidence for such optical variability in at least the case of ic  3599 ( brandt et  al .",
    "1995 ; grupe et  al .",
    "furthermore , optical outbursts have been detected from a few galaxies without near - simultaneous coverage , including ngc  4552 ( cappellari et  al . 1999 ) and perhaps ngc  1068 ( de  vaucouleurs 1991 ) .",
    "these outbursts should be distinguishable from nuclear supernovae based upon their spectral properties and light curves .",
    "the current data suggest that  should detect 220 optical outbursts from galactic nuclei in its deep , wide - field , and panoramic surveys .",
    "however , this estimate suffers from significant statistical and systematic uncertainties , and  observations will allow by far the best determination of the frequency of optical outbursts throughout the universe .",
    "optical outbursts discovered by   should be rapidly followed - up with and multiwavelength observatories to determine the nature of these events .",
    "presently , the lack of rapid multiwavelength follow - up studies is a major hindrance to understanding .",
    "combined  and studies should allow the discovery of hundreds of moderate - luminosity agn at @xmath106 ; only @xmath11 such agn are known presently . these agn have luminosities comparable to those of local seyfert galaxies and low - power quasars , and at @xmath106 their space density is much higher than for the rare , highly luminous quasars found by , e.g. , the sloan digital sky survey ( e.g. , cristiani et  al . 2004 ) .",
    "moderate - luminosity agn at @xmath106 can be selected effectively via the application of optical / near - infrared `` dropout '' techniques to sources . without complementary data ,",
    "many such agn in the  data will be difficult and observationally expensive to identify as they often have only modest agn signatures in the optical / near - infrared .",
    "stacking techniques could also be applied to the tens of thousands of @xmath106 -discovered galaxies that are not detected individually in x - rays .",
    "such stacking would tightly constrain the frequency of low - luminosity agn as well as emission associated with star formation .",
    "near - infrared  observations of sources should also break the current agn redshift `` barrier '' at @xmath12 , allowing the discovery of agn out to @xmath13 .",
    "a small number of @xmath14 candidates have already been identified in current deep surveys as extreme x - ray - to - optical ratio sources , but most and perhaps all probably lie at lower redshifts ( koekemoer et  al .",
    "wide fields with sensitive  and coverage would hopefully generate enough @xmath1210 agn to elucidate how the black holes formed by the deaths of the first stars grew to make luminous quasars at @xmath106 .",
    "high - resolution optical and near - infrared imaging , such as that to be provided by , is required to mitigate light blending between many moderate - luminosity agn and their host galaxies , thereby allowing the hosts to be studied reliably ( see  1 ) .",
    "grogin et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) have recently studied the host galaxies of samples of 100200 moderate - luminosity , selected agn at using  imaging from the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) .",
    "they find that these agn are preferentially hosted by galaxies with concentrated light profiles , generally corresponding to more bulge - dominated morphologies ( see fig .",
    "similar results have been derived from sersic - model fitting by b.d .",
    "simmons et  al .",
    ", in preparation .",
    "grogin et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that the locally observed relations between smbh mass and host - galaxy properties are already in place at @xmath15 ( see , e.g. , graham et al . 2001 for the local relation between smbh mass and concentration ) .",
    "imaging would allow these results to be refined using much larger samples , so that agn of closely matched luminosity and other properties could be studied in fine redshift bins .",
    "furthermore , the near - infrared capabilities of  would allow investigation of smbh / host - galaxy relations at @xmath16 , provided sufficient near - infrared sensitivity is achieved to overcome surface - brightness dimming .",
    "the discovery of an epoch beyond which smbhs and their host galaxies lose their tight relations would help to constrain models of smbh / galaxy co - evolution .",
    "grogin et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) also investigated if their moderate - luminosity agn samples showed enhanced merging or interaction activity relative to normal field galaxies , using an asymmetry index and near - neighbor counts ( see fig .",
    "they found no evidence for enhanced merging or interactions , results that are broadly consistent with those found for small samples of more luminous quasars ( see , e.g. ,  7 of dunlop et  al .",
    "wide fields surveyed by both  and missions would provide much larger agn samples with good source statistics spanning a range of at least 10,000 in nuclear luminosity .",
    "more subtle differences in merging and interaction activity might then become statistically detectable , and differences could be searched for sensitively in subsets of the agn population .",
    "there are substantial challenges to obtaining wide - field data with sufficient sensitivity to complement  properly .",
    "the exquisitely sensitive imaging of  will routinely reach . to obtain reliable counterparts to optical sources at these faint flux levels ,",
    "sub - arcsecond positions are required .",
    "given the x - ray - to - optical flux ratios observed for selected sources ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", sensitivities of ( from ) are required to complement  naturally.23 .",
    "will typically reach flux levels @xmath17 times fainter than these counterparts .",
    "] such sensitivities correspond to  exposures of 0.22  ms .",
    "thus , the total  exposure required to cover the 15  deg@xmath6  deep survey area appropriately would be ; the wide - field ( @xmath18  deg@xmath6 ) and panoramic ( @xmath19  deg@xmath6 )  surveys would require much more  exposure . even if  survives until the launch of  in @xmath20 ,  time - allocation committees may be hesitant to allocate the requisite enormous exposure !    future x - ray missions with larger photon collecting areas coupled with excellent angular resolution , such as esa s  and nasa s , offer better prospects for complementing  effectively . the nominal launch date for  of @xmath21",
    "is fairly well synchronized with that of , and  could obtain appropriate coverage of the  deep survey area in .",
    ", currently under study as a nasa space science vision mission , would probably not begin operation until after @xmath22 .",
    "it could appropriately survey the  deep survey area in about a week and could also complement the  wide - field and panoramic surveys .",
