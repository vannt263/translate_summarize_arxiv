    "is usually called single parton scattering ( sps ) and its contribution is in general the dominant process in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations . recently",
    ", several theoretical and experimental studies have shown that double parton scattering ( dps ) processes can not be neglected at lhc energies ( for a recent review see , e.g. ref .",
    "in particular , the experimental results from the lhcb collaboration on four @xmath2 meson production in @xmath3 collisions @xcite can only be described with the inclusion of the dps contribution . besides accounting for a significant part of the cross section ,",
    "the study of dps processes is also important for other reasons .",
    "it can , for example , help us to understand the spatial structure of hadrons @xcite , the multi - parton correlations in the hadronic wave function @xcite and is expected to help in the search for new physics ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "one of the promising processes to probe the dps mechanism is heavy quark production . at high energies",
    ", this process probes the hadron wave function at very small values of the bjorken - @xmath4 and its cross section can be calculated perturbatively .",
    "this process is dominated by gluon - gluon scatterings and a large cross section is predicted at the lhc by the single scattering mechanism . as a consequence of the large luminosity of small - @xmath4 gluons in the initial state , we expect a significant contribution of the dps mechanism to heavy quark production .",
    "this expectation has been confirmed by the analysis performed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the impact of saturation effects in dps production of heavy quarks .",
    "the results from refs .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that for charm production in @xmath3 collisions at lhc energies the double parton scattering contribution becomes comparable with the single parton scattering one .",

    "the dps mechanism is the analysis of different final states in nuclear collisions . the studies performed in ref . @xcite",
    "have shown that the dps mechanism is strongly enhanced in @xmath0 and @xmath6 collisions .",
    "these studies encourage us to extend our previous analysis to @xmath0 collisions and investigate the dps contribution to heavy quark production .",
    "in particular , we will estimate the magnitude of the dps cross section for @xmath1 collisions at @xmath7 tev , which can be measured at the lhc .",
    "as at small-@xmath4 and a large nucleus we expect a large contribution of saturation effects to heavy quark production @xcite , we also include these effects in our calculations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the basic assumptions and formulas derived in refs .",
    "@xcite , which we use to calculate the dps cross sections for the heavy quark production in @xmath0 collisions . in section [ sec_results ]",
    "we estimate the total cross section for the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 production for different nuclei and analyse its energy dependence . the dps and sps contributions are compared and the magnitude of the dps contribution for @xmath1 collisions at @xmath7 tev is presented .",
    "predictions for the kinematical range probed by the lhcb experiment also are show .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_conclusions ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "initially let us present a brief review of the formalism used to treat single and double parton scattering in a generic hadron - hadron collision . in the case of a sps process , we assume that only one hard interaction occurs per collision .",
    "the basic idea , which justifies this approach , is that the probability of a hard interaction in a collision is very small , which makes the probability of having two or more hard interactions in a collision highly suppressed with respect to the single interaction probability . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite such assumption is reasonable in the kinematical regime in which the flux of incoming partons is not very high .",
    "however , at lhc energies there is a high probability of scattering of more than one pair of partons in the same hadron - hadron collision .",
    "consequently , it is important to take into account the contribution of the dps processes .",
    "following the same factorization approximation assumed for processes with a single hard scattering , it is possible to derive the dps contribution for the heavy quark cross section considering two independent hard parton sub - processes .",
    "it is given by ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath11 where we assume that the quark - induced sub - processes can be disregarded at high energies , @xmath12 are the two - gluon parton distribution functions which depend on the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and on the transverse positions @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the two gluons undergoing hard processes at the scales @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the functions @xmath19 are the parton level sub - processes cross sections and @xmath20 is the impact parameter vector connecting the centres of the colliding hadrons in the transverse plane .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 is a combinatorial factor which accounts for indistinguishable and distinguishable final states . for @xmath22 one",
    "has @xmath23 , while @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "it is common in the literature to assume that the longitudinal and transverse components of the double parton distributions can be decomposed and that the longitudinal components can be expressed in terms of the product of two independent single parton distributions . as in @xcite",
    "we will also assume the validity of these assumptions and consider that the dps contribution to the heavy quark cross section can be expressed in a simple generic form given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a normalization cross section representing the effective transverse overlap of partonic interactions that produce the dps process .",
    "it is related with the impact parameter integral of the overlap function @xmath28 : @xmath29^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 describes the transverse parton density in a given hadron . in general , it has been considered as a free parameter to be determined through fits to experimental @xmath32 data , being given by : @xmath33 mb .",
    "( [ dps_fac ] ) , usually called `` pocket formula '' , expresses the dps cross section as the product of two individual sps cross sections assuming that the two sps sub - processes are uncorrelated and do not interfere .",
    "the validity of these strong assumptions at lhc and higher energies is still an open question , which has motivated several theoretical studies ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "however , the phenomenological analysis of different processes indicates that eq .",
    "( [ dps_fac ] ) can be considered a reasonable first approximation for the treatment of dps processes .    [",

    "[ f2_ratios_lhc_lhcb ] we present the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath34 for different final states .",
    "we denote by `` @xmath35 '' the ratio between the dps production of @xmath36 final state and the sps production of @xmath37 pair , with analogous notation for the other combinations . in the left panel",
    "we present the predictions for the full lhc rapidity range , while in the right panel we integrated over the rapidity range covered by the lhcb experiment .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates @xmath7 tev .",
    "our results for the full rapidity range indicate that the ratios `` @xmath35 '' and `` @xmath38 '' are of order of unity in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath7 tev , while the ratios `` @xmath39 '' and `` @xmath40 '' are smaller than 0.05 .",
    "in contrast , all ratios are smaller than 0.3 in the lhcb rapidity range . in ref .",
    "@xcite we estimated these same ratios for @xmath3 collisions . comparing the above results obtained for @xmath1 collisions with those presented in fig .",
    "@xcite , we have that these are considerably greater .",
    "therefore , even at the rapidity range of the lhcb , heavy quark production in dps processes is more likely to be experimentally detected in @xmath1 collisions than in @xmath3 collisions . as pointed in ref .",

    "recent experimental and theoretical studies of different final states that can be produced in @xmath3 collisions at the lhc have demonstrated that the contribution of double parton scattering processes can be non - negligible and should be taken into account .",
    "such contribution becomes large at high energies due to the large parton luminosity in the initial state and is enhanced in nuclear collisions . in this paper",
    "we have extended our previous study of dps production of heavy quarks in @xmath3 collisions to @xmath0 collisions .",
    "we have used the dipole approach and we have taken into account the saturation effects which are expected to be important for small @xmath4 and large nuclei .",
    "we estimated the @xmath43 dependence of the sps and dps cross sections and demonstrated that the dps contribution for charm production is similar to the sps one for @xmath1 collisions at @xmath7 tev and dominates at larger energies .",
