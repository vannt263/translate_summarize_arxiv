    "pairs of asteroids residing on very similar heliocentric orbits were recently discovered in the hungaria population and in the main belt ( e.g. , vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 ; pravec & vokrouhlick 2009 ; milani et  al .",
    "the orbits of components in a pair , often too similar to be a random fluke in the background population of asteroids , suggests a common origin .",
    "indeed , by backward integration of orbits of paired asteroids , we were able to identify , for most cases , specific epochs in the past tens to hundreds of kys when the two components become very close to each other .",
    "these close encounters were interpreted as formation events of the pairs during which the two components gently separated from a common parent body .",
    "asteroid pairs thus share some fundamental properties with the related asteroid families , the similarity being the most apparent for the very young families ( e.g. , nesvorn et  al .",
    "2006 ; nesvorn & vokrouhlick 2006 ; vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2011 ) : notably , members in both pairs and families arise as fragments from a disintegrated parent asteroid .",
    "however , it has been unclear whether they also share a common formation process . indeed , while the larger asteroid families are obviously of collisional origin , vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2008 ) have discussed several other putative formation processes for the asteroid pairs . the hunt for identification of the formation process of the asteroid pairs motivated pravec et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) to conduct photometric observations of the primary ( larger ) components in numerous pairs .",
    "their main results can be summarized as follows : ( i ) there is a strong correlation between the rotation period of the primary component and mass ratio of the two asteroids in the pair , and ( ii ) there is a lack of pairs with mass ratio of the two asteroids larger than @xmath5 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of ( i ) above is as follows : in pairs where one component is much smaller than the other , the primaries systematically rotate very fast ( near the rotation fission barrier observed for solitary asteroids ; e.g. , pravec et  al .",
    "2002 ) , whereas in pairs that have a smaller mass ratio between the larger and smaller components , the primaries systematically rotate very slow .",
    "these observations convincingly demonstrate that most of the asteroid pairs were formed by rotational fission rather than catastrophic ( collisional ) breakup of the parent body ( cf .",
    "pravec et  al .",
    "the yorp effect has been suggested as the underlying physical mechanism that brought the parent body rotation to the fission limit .    to further characterize the principal formation process of the asteroid pairs",
    ", it is important to both ( i ) continue observations of parameters of the whole population , and ( ii ) also characterize selected pairs as precisely as possible .",
    "this work goes along the ( ii ) line .",
    "already vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2008 ) recognized that the pair of asteroids ( 6070 ) rheinland and ( 54827 ) 2001  nq8 is somewhat exceptional among other known pairs since it allows the most precise determination of its age .",
    "this is because the age is young , @xmath6  kyr only , and the two asteroids are large enough such that effects of both dynamical chaos and thermal forces are minimized in their past orbital evolution .",
    "vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2009 ) extended and substantiated the previous work by taking into account also mutual gravitational forces of the two components in the initial phase of their separation . statistical analysis of the angle between the angular momenta of the heliocentric orbital motion of rheinland and the mutual motion of the two components at their separation let these authors to conjecture that rheinland s rotation should be preferentially retrograde rather then prograde .",
    "in this paper we probe this conjecture by direct determination of rheinland s pole orientation (   2 and 3 ) . using this information ,",
    "we revisit determination of the age for this pair by backward tracking of its components orbits into the past (   4 ) .",
    "previous photometry of rheinland , from its favorable opposition in 2009 , has been reported in the supplementary materials of pravec et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in this paper",
    ", we report additional observations from three oppositions in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 - 2011 . altogether",
    "we thus present 34 lightcurves whose observation details , such as the aspect data , heliocentric and observer distances , and observing stations are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "a more detailed information about the telescopes and data reduction procedures could be found in the supplementary materials of pravec et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "the data from 2008 are limited , yet they are important for our modeling because they offer a new viewing geometry and help constraining the precise value of the sidereal rotation period .",
    "the data from the 2009 opposition are very numerous , reach up to @xmath7 phase angles before and after opposition and cover an interval of 4 months .",
    "this is because during the opposition in september 2009 the asteroid was close to perihelion of its orbit and thus was quite bright , up to magnitude @xmath8 in visible band .",
    "the data from 2010 - 2011 opposition are fewer , because of fainter brightness , still they cover an interval of nearly 4 months too .",
    "they are less symmetrically distributed about the opposition in march  2011 , with less observations before and more observation after the opposition .",
    "the sufficiently long periods of time covered by observations in 2009 and 2010 - 2011 allow an unambiguous link of the data and provide a unique solution for the rotation period . during the 2009 and 2010 - 2011 oppositions ,",
    "the geocentric ecliptic latitudes of the asteroid were different which suitably provides complementary aspects of view .",
    "however , due to a small inclination of rheinland s orbit with respect to the ecliptic , this latitude difference of the observations was still rather small . as a result ,",
    "determination of rheinland s rotation pole longitude is problematic and has larger uncertainty (   3 ) .",
    "most of the data are on relative magnitude scales , either in clear or r filters , but the three nights taken from ondejov in february and march 2011 were absolutely calibrated in the cousins r system using landolt standard stars . using the parametrization of the phase function as described by the h - g system ( e.g. , bowell et al .",
    "1989 ) , we derived the best fit values for the absolute r magnitude @xmath9 and the slope parameter @xmath10 .",
    "their formal errors , estimated accounting for uncertainties of the absolute calibrations , are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . a systematic error of absolute magnitude estimated using the h - g function can be @xmath13  mag ( see harris 1991 ) ;",
    "we adopt this larger uncertainty for our estimated @xmath14 .",
    "the absolute magnitude @xmath14 is that of the mean value over the lightcurve cycle . assuming @xmath15 , which is the mean color index for s - type asteroids ( e.g. , shevchenko & lupishko 1998 ) that predominate in the inner main belt where rheinland is located , we estimated its absolute @xmath16 magnitude @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly , this value is significantly larger than @xmath18 given by the mpc database or @xmath19 given by the astdys databse ( both use data from astrometric surveys ) .",
    "this example shows importance of the dedicated and accurate photometry in specific projects like analysis of the asteroid pairs .",
    "we used the lightcurve inversion method of kaasalainen & torppa ( 2001 ) and kaasalainen et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) to derive rheinland s shape , sidereal rotation period and spin axis direction from the available data described in   2 .",
    "we assume the body rotates about the shortest axis of the inertia tensor which is fixed in the inertial space .",
    "this is because ( i ) fourier analysis of the individual lightcuves from different nights were sufficiently well fitted with a single rotation period and its overtones ( due to irregular shape ) ,  my for this body ( see , e.g. , harris 1994 ) , while the age of the rheinland-2001  nq8 pair is much younger (   4 ) .",
    "this implies that the disruption process that has led to this pair formation was very gentle and did not excite rheinland s rotation . actually , the same conclusion holds also for many primaries in sub - my old pairs analysed by pravec et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) . ] and ( ii ) gravitational and radiative torques can change the spin state only on much longer timespan than the 4 years between the first and the last observations .",
    "the fourier fits of the individual lightcurves were also used to estimate statistical uncertainty of the individual measurements , a task which is characteristically murky for the asteroid photometry .",
    "this is because number of systematic sources of errors may prevent assignment of a clean , gaussian - type uncertainty to the measurements .",
    "still , we are thus able to discriminate between data with a very low scatter of the neighboring measurements from those with large scatter of the neighboring measurements , and assign appropriate relative weights to the data .",
    "we also assume a convex shape represented with a polyhedron of a certain number ( typically hundreds to thousands ) of surface facets whose areas are given by the exponential representation described in kaasalainen & torppa ( 2001 ) .",
    "we only consider a combination of the lommel - seeliger and lambert scattering of the sunlight on the surface of the asteroid .",
    "the method seeks to adjust free parameters in order to minimize a target function of a @xmath20-type . , where @xmath21 is the total number of observations and @xmath22 is the number of solved - for parameters of the model , @xmath23 their estimated uncertainty from the analysis of observations scatter about fourier representation of the individual lightcurves , and @xmath24 is the difference between the observed and computed brightness . for relative photometry",
    ", the lightcurves can be arbitrarily shifted on the magnitude scale . ]",
    "our best - fit solution has sidereal rotation period @xmath25  hr and rotation pole at @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are ecliptic longitude and latitude .",
    "figure  [ lcs ] shows a sample of lightcurve data compared to the model .",
    "the pole position is , however , not strongly constrained and using the longitude - latitude parametrization we can not simply assign some formal uncertainties . rather , we show in figure  [ polesky ] a whole - sky map of the @xmath20 values for individually best - fitted shape models .",
    "since the @xmath20 values were normalized by number of degrees of freedom , the solutions with @xmath29 would formally match the data in a statistical sense .",
    "however , we recall that the photometric observation uncertainties may not strictly - speaking obey the gaussian statistics and that also systematic and modeling errors are important . for these reasons ,",
    "the globally best - fit solution has @xmath30 . to make the best - fit solution statistically acceptable , we would have to increase the formal errors of the measurements by about 25% .",
    "the @xmath20-isocontour shown in figure  [ polesky ] corresponds to solutions with 10% larger @xmath20 value than the global minimum ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) , which we consider still admissible . because in our case @xmath32 and the number of parameters @xmath33 , the number of degrees of freedom is @xmath34 , and the 10% increase of @xmath20 corresponds to about @xmath35 interval of the @xmath20 distribution with @xmath36 degrees of freedom .",
    "distribution with @xmath36 degrees of freedom has mean @xmath36 and variance @xmath37 ( e.g. , press et  al .",
    "we consider solutions with @xmath38 values to be inadmissible , as , indeed , they show too large inconsistencies between the observed and computed magnitudes . adopting this approach to the estimation of the uncertainty of our model , we may conclude that the ecliptic longitude of rheinland s pole is not well constrained yet , but the ecliptic latitude must be smaller than @xmath39 . with only very small inclination of the orbit with respect to the ecliptic plane ( its proper value is @xmath40 ) , our result thus implies that the obliquity @xmath41 of rheinland s pole is @xmath0 , with the best - fit solution value of @xmath42 .",
    "rotation period solutions of rheinland within the admissible zone differ by at most @xmath43  hr .",
    "we can thus consider this value as a realistic uncertainty of our solution for the sidereal rotation period for ( 6070 )  rheinland .",
    "the best - fit shape of rheinland is shown in figure  [ shape ] .",
    "the convex representation with 2038 surface facets is shown at the top panels .",
    "panels at bottom show , for sake of interest , a non - convex model which has basically the same @xmath20 value as the convex - shape solution . in general",
    ", the photometry of main belt asteroids , such as rheinland , can not unambiguously reveal non - convex features of their surface ( e.g. , urech & kaasalainen 2003 ) .",
    "the leftmost and rightmost views on figure  [ shape ] indicate that our shape model of rheinland has a sharp , planar - like edge . while the lightcurve dataset is still not very abundant , and our shape modeling may thus have its limitations , we note that this feature is correlated with the observed steep lightcurve decreases ( see , e.g. , near the phase 0.8 at the right and top panel on figure  [ lcs ] ) and can not be entirely artificial .",
    "it is tempting to hypothesize , that this feature may correspond to the surface zone where the secondary component 2001  nq8 separated from the parent body of this pair .",
    "further photometric observations of rheinland are important not only to shrink the persisting uncertainty in the pole position , but also to confirm this interesting surface feature .",
    "unfortunately , the next favorable opposition which will provide novel viewing geometry on the asteroid , and the target will be bright enough , starts only in november 2013 and lasts till january 2014 .",
    "the above obtained constraint of the pole orientation for ( 6070 ) rheinland may help us to refine determination of its age using backward integration of orbits of the two components in this pair .",
    "this is because the known obliquity importantly constrains the value of yarkovsky effect , one of the two factors that limit our ability of an accurate ( deterministic ) orbital reconstruction in the past .",
    "detailed description of the age determination of a given pair of asteroids using backward integration of their orbits was given by vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "here we only outline the main features of the approach , especially if relevant to findings in this paper .",
    "the currently best - fit osculating orbits of both ( 6070 ) rheinland ( primary ) and ( 54827 ) 2001  nq8 ( secondary ) , derived from the available astrometric observations , are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "these data were taken from astdys database provided by university of pisa ( see ) .",
    "both orbits are fairly well constrained at a comparable level , reflecting that both asteroids have been observed over many oppositions and hundreds of astrometric measurements are available for each of them .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] gives information about the uncertainty of the six orbital osculating elements @xmath44 , but the complete solution obviously provides also the full covariance matrix @xmath45 of the orbital fit , from which mutual correlations can be derived . while these correlations are only moderately significant , with the largest correlation of @xmath46% between the semimajor axis and longitude in orbit solutions , it is important to take them into account . based on this information , we construct probability density distribution @xmath47 $ ] ( e.g. , milani & gronchi 2010 ) , where @xmath48 with @xmath49 the best - fit orbital values given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "all solutions @xmath44 with high - enough value of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is related to a given confidence level , are statistically equivalent and thus we can not consider @xmath49 as the only orbital realization of either primary or secondary components in our pair of asteroids . choosing a number of orbits which will represent each of the asteroids in our numerical simulation , we used @xmath52 to determine their initial orbital values @xmath44 .",
    "we call these different initial orbital realizations geometrical clones .",
    "the geometrical clones occupy a six - dimensional ellipsoid in the @xmath44-space , or after an appropriate transformation a six - dimensional ellipsoid region in the cartesian space of heliocentric positions and velocities .",
    "when restricted to a three - dimensional space of heliocentric positions , the geometrical clones occupy a three - dimensional ellipsoid region with the longest axis approximately 200  km and 400  km for the primary and secondary components in the rheinland-2001  nq8 pair .",
    "this shows how tightly constrained are both orbits at the initial epoch .",
    "for sake of comparison with our convergence efforts described below , we note that the size of both uncertainty ellipsoids today is smaller than the radius of the hill sphere of influence of the primary ( rheinland ) component ( approximately 1000  km ) .",
    "when propagated backward in time , the region occupied by geometric clones extends . in the case of rheinland-2001  nq8 pair , and over the relevant @xmath53  kyr timescale of its age ,",
    "this extension is basically a simple stretching in the along - track direction by the keplerian shear of initial orbits with slightly different values of the semimajor axis ( in angular terms , the uncertainty translates to about @xmath54 uncertainty in the longitude of orbit ) . this is because the orbits are not affected by any of the major resonances .",
    "so while the short axes of the uncertainty ellipsoid only slightly increase with respect to its initial size , the long axis stretches to about @xmath55  km some @xmath53  kyr ago .",
    "this represents about 300 times the radius of the hill sphere of influence of rheinland .",
    "this uncertainty is very small and would have allowed even more precise age determination of the pair if there were not for the second source of the uncertainty in the past ephemerides for both components .",
    "this latter effect is due to uncertainty in the dynamical model , in particular parameters that influence strength and direction of the thermal accelerations known as the yarkovsky effect ( bottke et  al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "the main orbital perturbation by the yarkovsky effect is a secular change in the semimajor axis , whose magnitude and sign depends on asteroid s size , surface thermal inertia and rotation state .",
    "while the asteroid s size can be roughly estimated from the absolute magnitude and assumed value of geometric albedo , the surface thermal inertia and rotation state are apriori unknown from astrometric observations .",
    "thermal inertia influences only the magnitude of the effect to a factor which is typically not more than @xmath56 ( e.g. , vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "2000 ) , however the spin axis obliquity value determines the overall sign of the semimajor axis drift : for prograde - rotating asteroids the semimajor axis increases in time while for the retrograde - rotating asteroids decreases in time . as a result ,",
    "having been able to constrain rheinland s obliquity value , we remove a significant degree in uncertainty in its past orbital evolution . as described in vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the semimajor axis secular change due to the yarkovsky effect @xmath57 directly propagates into a quadratic perturbation in the longitude in orbit .",
    "the yarkovsky effect thus adds additional component to the orbital stretching in the long - track direction , and over the @xmath53  kyr timescale it becomes more important than the effect of the initial orbit uncertainty . using eq .",
    "( 30 ) in vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we obtain @xmath58 longitude in orbit uncertainty of the rheinland s orbit @xmath59  kyr ago",
    ".  km size estimate from the absolute magnitude determined in   2 and assumed geometric albedo @xmath60 , and thermal inertia @xmath61  j / m@xmath62/s@xmath63/k , appropriate mean value for small asteroids of rheinland s size ( e.g. , delb et  al .",
    "since we consider an albedo value near the upper limit of the s - type class asteroids of rheinland s absolute magnitude , the obtained size is rather an underestimate . as in vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2008 , 2009 )",
    "we adopt this conservative approach not to exclude any possible yarkovsky drift - rates of the semimajor axis from our analysis . ]",
    "this is @xmath64 times more than the spread of geometrical clones at the same time . because the yarkovsky effect magnitude is indirectly proportional to the asteroid s size , the along - track uncertainty is even larger for the secondary component ( 54827 ) 2001  nq8 , for which in amounts to @xmath65 longitude in orbit uncertainty",
    "this is again an effect @xmath64 times larger than that produced by the uncertainty of the initial orbital data for this asteroid .",
    "we model the influence of unconstrained yarkovsky effect by assigning to each geometric clone a spectrum of yarkovsky accelerations .",
    "we call these different orbital variants yarkovsky clones . to simplify computations",
    ", we represent the yarkovsky acceleration by an empirical transverse acceleration with a magnitude determined by the modeled rate @xmath57 of the secular change in semimajor axis ( e.g. , vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 , 2009 ) .",
    "we used swift_mvs numerical integrator for orbit propagation to the past ( e.g. , levison & duncan 1997 ) with a fixed timestep of @xmath66  days .",
    "perturbations due to all planets , whose initial data at mjd 55600 were taken from the jpl de405 ephemerides , are included .",
    "the empirical formulation of the thermal forces , as described above , has been added to the code .",
    "we propagated 20 geometrical and 30 yarkovsky clones for both primary and secondary components in the rheinland-2001  nq8 pair , so altogether 600 clones for each asteroid , and examined online their mutual distances every @xmath67  y during the orbital propagation . because we had a preliminary knowledge of the age for this pair , we integrated orbits of all clones to @xmath68  kyr in the past .",
    "velocity components of the initial data , both planets and asteroid clones , were reversed and integration timestep was positive . with that setting ,",
    "the true drift rate values of the semimajor axis are reversed .",
    "so , while the obliquity @xmath0 for ( 6070 ) rheinland implies negative value of @xmath57 , we assigned formally positive @xmath57 value to the yarkovsky clones of this asteroid in our backward integration ( to prevent confusions , though , we use the true @xmath57 values in what follows ) . because of the unknown value of the surface thermal inertia of rheinland , we conservatively considered all values @xmath57 between @xmath69  au / my and @xmath70 ( appropriate for this asteroid size , bottke et  al .",
    "2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "in the case of the secondary component , ( 54827 ) 2001  nq8 , we took yarkovsky clones with both positive and negative @xmath57 values .",
    "for sake of a more detailed analysis below , we actually ran two simulations , first with 30 clones of 2001  nq8 and @xmath57 positive and second with 30 clones of 2001  nq8 and @xmath57 negative .",
    "the maximum @xmath71 value in this case was @xmath72  au / my , because the secondary component in the pair has about half the size of the primary .",
    "as described above , some @xmath73  kyr ago the regions of uncertainty in the past ephemerides occupied by the geometric and yarkovsky clones of both components the rheinland-2001  nq8 pair resemble very elongated ellipsoids in cartesian space .",
    "their long axes are @xmath74 times for rheinland , resp .",
    "@xmath75 times for 2001  nq8 , the estimated hill sphere of influence of rheinland which is the quantitative measure of the orbital convergence ( see , e.g. , vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2009 ) .",
    "henceforth only a fraction of propagated clones result in a successful convergence in our numerical experiment . in practice ,",
    "every @xmath67  y step in our propagation we compute relative distance and velocity of each rheinland s clone and each 2001  nq8 s clone .",
    "we consider the configuration to be convergent when the clone distance is less than 75% of the instantaneous hill sphere of rheinland ( typically @xmath76  km ) and their relative velocity is less than @xmath77  m / s ( i.e. , the estimated escape velocity from rheinland ) .",
    "examining these convergent cases not only provides a constraint of the age for this pair , but it may also provide additional information such as preference between the yarkovsky clones of the secondary component , 2001  nq8 , with positive or negative @xmath57 values .    figure  [ sol ] shows results of our backward tracking of clones for both primary and secondary components in the rheinland-2001  nq8 pair .",
    "the light gray histogram corresponds to the run where the yarkovsky clones of 2001  nq8 had @xmath78 , i.e. the same sign as those of rheinland .",
    "the black histogram corresponds to the run where the yarkovsky clones of 2001  nq8 had @xmath79 , i.e. the opposite sign as those of rheinland .",
    "the former case thus means the rotation of 2001  nq8 has same ( retrograde ) sense as that of rheinland , while the latter case implies the opposite .",
    "there are about 15 times more successful convergence solutions in the former case than in the latter .",
    "the mean and standard deviation values of the age estimates are @xmath80  kyr for the former case and @xmath81  kyr in the latter case .",
    "as it has been suggested above , not all combinations of clones provide convergent configurations : at best , we had @xmath82 fraction success . since the long axes of the ellipsoids occupied by clones have been estimated to @xmath74 , resp .",
    "@xmath83 , hill spheres of rheinland , while the short axes are comparable to the hill sphere of rheinland , the @xmath82 success rate for convergence implies a very small tilt between the long axes of the uncertainty ellipsoids of rheinland and 2001  nq8 clones .",
    "indeed , our convergent solutions were always characterized with a very small relative velocity of the order @xmath84  cm / s , implying very similar orbits ( see also vokrouhlick & nesvorn 2008 , 2009 ) .      while we obtained some convergent solutions for the opposite rotation sense of the secondary component 2001  nq8 as compared to rheinland",
    ", we had an order - of - magnitude more solutions for the same sense of rotation of both components in the pair .",
    "if we were to attribute a pure statistical meaning to this difference , we were to conclude that the case of parallel spin orientations of both components in the rheinland-2001  nq8 pair is a more likely case .",
    "obviously , such a conclusion is problematic because so far we do obtain convergence solution for both spin orientations of 2001  nq8 .",
    "it thus appears that determination of the rotation state for 2001  nq8 is the key element for both better determination of this pair s age but also for constraining the formation process .",
    "note , for instance , that the @xmath85  hr rotation period of the secondary by itself favors `` a prompt ejection scenario '' as opposed to `` a destabilization of a binary scenario '' ( see pravec et  al .",
    "2010 ) , but knowing the pole orientation of 2001  nq8 would provide a much more complete information . the analysis would be eased if it were indeed near - to - parallel with the pole of rheinland , as hinted here , because the spin - orbit secular resonances do not affect the retrograde rotation states ( e.g. , vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "2006 ) .      while the solution of the rotation state and shape of rheinland in ",
    "3 is still very limited , we may use it to estimate the value of a secular change in its rotation rate @xmath86 due to the yorp effect .",
    "one should take this exercise as an example of interest rather than a true prediction , since the yorp effect have been shown to eventually depend on many unknown or inaccurately known parameters such as the small - scale structures of the asteroid shape ( e.g. , statler 2009 ; breiter et  al .",
    "2009 ) or inhomogeneities in the density distribution ( e.g. , scheeres & gaskell 2008 ) .",
    "taking thus the best fit solution for rheinland s shape and rotation state from ",
    "3 we obtain @xmath87  rad / d@xmath62 . in terms of magnitude , this is about the expected value for an asteroid of its size and heliocentric distance if we appropriately scale the directly detected yorp values for ( 54509 ) yorp ( e.g. , lowry et  al .",
    "2007 ; taylor et  al .",
    "2007 ) , ( 1862 ) apollo ( e.g. , kaasalainen et  al . 2007 ) or ( 1620 ) geographos ( e.g. , urech et  al . 2008 ) .",
    "the positive sign of @xmath88 implies the rotation rate of rheinland is accelerated by the yorp torques , and in @xmath89  my it may bring its rotation state to the fission limit . assuming the rheinland-2001  nq8 pair",
    "was actually born by rotational fission of a precursor asteroid , this would have been at least the second such event for the same body . while future improved shape solutions for rheinland , from larger observation datasets , may modify our result , we consider this to be an example of a process that may actually be frequent for small asteroids in the main belt : a sequence of fission events driven by yorp torques that continually erode the body by mass shedding and producing either paired secondaries or binary systems .",
    "we note that the estimated timescale above is quite shorter than the collisional lifetime of rheinland , some @xmath90  gy according to bottke et  al .",
    "unfortunately , the small value of @xmath88 means that we will not be able to directly measure yorp effect for this asteroid any soon .",
    "one can easily estimate that at least four to five decades with suitably distributed data are necessary for this task .",

    "<S> main belt asteroids ( 6070 ) rheinland and ( 54827 ) 2001  nq8 belong to a small population of couples of bodies which reside on very similar heliocentric orbits . </S>",
    "<S> vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2008 , aj 136 , 280 ) promoted a term `` asteroid pairs '' , pointing out their common origin within the past tens to hundreds of ky . </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts to reconstruct the initial configuration of rheinland and 2001  nq8 at the time of their separation have led to the prediction that rheinland s rotation should be retrograde . here </S>",
    "<S> we report extensive photometric observations of this asteroid and use the lightcurve inversion technique to directly determine its rotation state and shape . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the retrograde sense of rotation of rheinland , with obliquity value constrained to be @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the ecliptic longitude of the pole position is not well constrained as yet . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric behavior of rheinland s lightcurve reflects a sharp , near - planar edge in our convex shape representation of this asteroid . </S>",
    "<S> our calibrated observations in the red filter also allow us to determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 values of the h - g system . </S>",
    "<S> with the characteristic color index @xmath3 for the s - type asteroids , we thus obtain @xmath4 for the absolute magnitude of ( 6070 ) rheinland . this a significantly larger value than previously obtained from analysis of the astrometric survey observations . </S>",
    "<S> we next use the obliquity constraint for rheinland to eliminate some degree of uncertainty in the past propagation of its orbit . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the sign of the past secular change of its semimajor axis due to the yarkovsky effect is now constrained . </S>",
    "<S> determination of the rotation state of the secondary component , asteroid ( 54827 ) 2001  nq8 , is the key element in further constraining the age of the pair and its formation process . </S>"
