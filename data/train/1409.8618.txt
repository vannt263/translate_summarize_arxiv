    "one of the main hurdles of photonic technology is the ability to store temporarily information directly from an optical stream @xcite .",
    "an ideal platform is that of vcsels that , when externally driven by a coherent laser field and operated below threshold , can support stable localized light structures in response to an appropriate writing optical signal @xcite .",
    "not only are vcsels technologically integrated with standard electronics , so that they can form a valid bridge between an electronic motherboard and a guided or free - air optical network , but they can be built in a so - called `` broad area '' format , so that the encoded spatial structure only pervades a small micron - sized transverse portion of the 100 + @xmath0 m cavity @xcite .",
    "this allows , in specific conditions , a dynamic formation of localized structures known as cavity solitons @xcite that can move and interact @xcite . since the structures are optically generated , an important issue is how to achieve their rapid control through an electrical signal .",
    "fundamentally , this is an issue of spatial light modulation , so that standard techniques based on micro - arrays of liquid - crystals or mirrors are applicable @xcite . in turn , these techniques are burdened by intrinsic limitations associated to a millisecond response time .",
    "an alternative scheme is to make use of acousto - optic modulation @xcite and , ideally , electro - optics , where response time down to and below the nanosecond scale is readily achieved .    recently , columbo et al .",
    "@xcite theoretically investigated the idea of steering localized structures in a vcsel through soliton electro - activation @xcite .",
    "in fact , spatial solitons in photorefractive crystals @xcite can embed inside the electro - optic sample optical waveguides @xcite that can be arranged into arrays @xcite . when this is achieved inside a paraelectric sample , the waveguides can be switched on and off with nanosecond response times @xcite , forming a miniaturized array of electro - optic switches @xcite .",
    "an even more versatile electro - activated waveguide is achieved using so - called electro - activated funnel waveguides @xcite , where the limits to photorefractive spatial soliton waveguides associated to bending @xcite , circular symmetry @xcite , and time stability @xcite , are absent .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the switching on of an 11 @xmath0 m ( full - width - at - half - maximum , fwhm ) localized optical structure inside a broad area ( 200 @xmath0m - diameter ) vcsel cavity through an electro - activated funnel waveguide structure in an electrically biased sample of potassium - lithium - tantalate - niobate ( kltn ) .",
    "we are also able to show that the localized structure is bistable , that is , it remains on even if the writing signal is eventually switched off , and that a single localized structure can be addressed independently , that is , without exciting other similar localized structures in the cavity .",

    "is first expanded ( t1 ) , then , after polarization and power tuning ( wp1 and p ) , split in two branches ( bs1 ) .",

    "then , in the read - out phase , a focused infrared beam ( eb ) is launched into the waveguide and its propagation is electro - optically driven by means of the electroactivation , that is , by the nonlinear combination of the applied static field and the previously imprinted space - charge field caused by the quadratic electro - optic response @xcite .",

    "the emitted peak intensity increases by 20 times .",
    "when + 1 kv is applied , something qualitatively different occurs : a localized structure abruptly forms ( the temporal resolution is limited by the single figure frame capture of the ccd , around 100 ms ) , as shown in fig .",

    "the localized structure forms pinned to a fixed position ( green dashed line crossing ) in the vcsel that does not need to coincide with the position of the eb , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the switch - on phenomenon is observed repositioning the eb throughout the region surrounding the position of the localized structure , illustrated with the dashed circle in fig.[modulation]h , a region of approximately 30 @xmath0 m diameter .",
    "the switching is also dependent on the relative phase of eb and bb , which in turn depends on the actual applied voltage @xmath21 . in our reported instance , the relative phase is optimized during alignment so that switching occurs only when the voltage + 1 kv is delivered . finally , the localized structure is switched off , erasing the information stored in the vcsel , either by lowering the pump current or changing the mismatch of the driving coherent field .",
    "the superimposed spectra of both vcsel and diode beams ( bb and eb ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ figurepath ] : the mismatch between the highest peak of vcsel spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ figurevcsel]e ) and the wavelength of the injected beam is @xmath6 1 nm . note that , in agreement with theory , structures are observed when the injected laser wavelength is longer than the highest components of the vcsel spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated the activation of a localized @xmath411 @xmath0 m structure at 977 nm inside a 200 @xmath0 m vcsel through an electro - optically controlled writing beam .",
    "the activating beam is controlled using an electro - optic funnel waveguide embedded inside the volume of a paraelectric near - transition sample of kltn .",
