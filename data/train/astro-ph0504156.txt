    "it is now well established that elliptical galaxies contain substantial quantities of hot gas .",
    "detailed studies of the x - ray emission produced by this hot gas have revealed that its luminosity is correlated with the gas temperature , b - band luminosity , and stellar velocity dispersion of the host elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "these correlations argue for an evolutionary link between the process that formed the elliptical galaxy and the surrounding , x - ray emitting gas .    according to the `` merger hypothesis , '' elliptical galaxies are formed when two spiral galaxies interact and merge @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that disk - galaxy interactions transform spirals galaxies into ellipticals _ and _ generate their hot gaseous halos . using the x - ray satellite @xmath2 , @xcite investigated the x - ray luminosity evolution along the `` toomre sequence '' @xcite , a series of eight local galaxies representing different stages of merging , in chronological order .",
    "their study found that extended x - ray emission is produced during the encounter and persists as the nuclei merge .",
    "similar results obtain from observations of merging and interacting systems using the higher resolution @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a puzzling aspect of the analysis of @xcite is that the merger remnants appear to be underluminous when compared to typical elliptical galaxies , bringing into question the likelihood that merger remnants evolve into normal ellipticals .",
    "these authors suggested several methods by which a merger remnant could acquire an x - ray halo , late infall of tidal material , reacquisition of gas ejected by galactic winds during the merger , and ongoing mass - loss by stars born during a merger - induced starburst .",
    "one clue to the origin of the hot gas lies in the correlation between the x - ray and @xmath0-band luminosities .",
    "@xcite , also using @xmath2 , found that @xmath4 for less massive ellipticals , consistent with their x - ray luminosity being primarily stellar in origin .",
    "however , the x - ray emission from more luminous ellipticals varies as @xmath5 , indicating a non - stellar formation process .",
    "another clue to the origin of hot gas in spheroidal systems is its high metallicity .",
    "@xcite analyzed a sample of 29 x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies and found that their two - phase models for the hot x - ray emitting plasma yielded metallicities that were typically solar or even higher and generally correlated with the stellar metallicity .",
    "this result indicates that the gas that makes up the hot coronae surrounding ellipticals has been recycled from star - forming gas and likely once resided within the dense central regions of the galaxies .",
    "this also suggests that a significant amount of energy was injected into this gas in order to expel it from the depths of the potential well and redistribute it throughout the galactic halo .",
    "the work described here is a first attempt to address the viability of galaxy mergers in generating x - ray emitting gaseous halos consistent with observed ellipticals .",
    "while numerical simulations have demonstrated that galaxy interactions can indeed produce remnant galaxies whose stellar component is reminiscent of local ellipticals @xcite , little is known theoretically about the evolution of the hot gas component in these events . @xcite considered simulations in which the gas was not allowed to cool radiatively and showed that in this limit it would be mostly shock heated to the virial temperature of the remnant , leaving a corona of hot , x - ray emitting material .",
    "later , @xcite showed that the amount of hot gas is dependent on the interaction orbit , i.e. , more radial encounters produce more hot gas . yet the ability of this hot gas to produce x - rays , the luminosity of the x - ray emission , and the correlation to the remnant stellar properties are all open questions .",
    "in particular , these studies did not attempt to model all feedback processes in detail .",
    "recently , @xcite have developed methods for modeling feedback from both star formation and black hole growth in galaxy mergers .",
    "this addition to our galaxy modeling has significant implications for the x - ray evolution as the feedback energy from an accreting black hole can generate a substantial amount of hot gas through the production of a large - scale galactic wind .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : sim ] we describe the numerical simulations upon which are results are based . in   [ sec : onemerger ] we detail the x - ray emission produced during and after the collision of two gas - rich disk galaxies .",
    "we follow this by showing how the global properties of x - rays and hot gas depend on progenitor mass and gas fraction in   [",
    "sec : scalings ] .",
    "  [ sec : disc ] discusses our results , specifically addressing the x - ray luminosities of our merger remnants and the generation of hot gaseous halos observed in luminous elliptical galaxies .",
    "finally , we conclude in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "to simulate mergers of disk galaxies , we employ gadget2 @xcite , which is based on a `` conservative - entropy '' formulation @xcite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) that conserves both energy and entropy ( unlike earlier versions of sph ; see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while improving shock - capturing .",
    "the code includes the effects of radiative cooling and heating by a uniform uv background , and star formation , supernova feedback , and metal enrichment are treated in the manner detailed in @xcite . within this formalism , the sub - resolution physics of star formation and supernova feedback acts to maintain star - forming gas at a temperature specified by an effective equation of state ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as an extension of this star formation and feedback model , @xcite introduced an additional parameter @xmath6 , so that the effective equation of state can be varied between that for an isothermal gas at @xmath7 k , @xmath8 , and the `` stiff '' springel - hernquist equation of state , which has an effective temperature @xmath9 k , @xmath10 . in the work presented here ,",
    "@xmath11 was set to 0.25 resulting in a mass - weighted temperature of star - forming gas @xmath12  k.    our simulations also allow the presence of a supermassive black hole ( bh ) .",
    "bhs are represented by `` sink '' particles that can accrete neighboring gas at a rate given by the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton approximation with an imposed upper limit equal to the eddington rate . a small fraction ( typically 5% ) of the bolometric luminosity ( 0.1@xmath13 , assuming an accretion efficiency of 10% ) thermally couples to the gas surrounding the bh .",
    "these parameters are selected so that simulations of disk - galaxy mergers successfully reproduce the normalization of the @xmath14-@xmath15 relation @xcite .",
    "the bh , when included , has a seed mass of @xmath16  , although we find that the outcome is insensitive to this choice .",
    "a more complete discussion of the methodology is provided in @xcite .",
    "the mergers used throughout this paper are identical to those in @xcite and are described in more detail there and in @xcite .",
    "a full description of the construction of these galaxies is given in @xcite ; here we simply outline the parameter choices for the simulations discussed in this work .",
    "the composite system contains an exponential disk embedded in a dark matter halo . for simplicity",
    "we do not include a spheroidal bulge .",
    "the dark - mater halo is initialized with a @xcite profile , a concentration @xmath17 , and a spin parameter @xmath18 . in section",
    "[ sec : scalings ] we investigate hot gas production for mergers between equal mass galaxies with a range of masses , but much of our discussion is based on a fiducial case where the progenitor galaxies have properties similar to the milky way .",
    "the virial velocity in this case is @xmath19  kms@xmath20 , resulting in a halo mass of 1.4@xmath21 .",
    "the exponential disk composes 4.1% of the total mass , with a fixed fraction @xmath22 in a collisional gaseous component .",
    "our fiducial simulation fixes @xmath23 .",
    "the compound galaxy is realized with 500,000 particles to represent the dark matter and 50,000 to represent the disk .",
    "since the disk comprises both stellar and gaseous components , a fraction @xmath24 are consider gas and the remainder represent the collisionless stellar disk",
    ".     +    once the model galaxies are generated , we collide two disks by placing them on a parabolic orbit with an initial separation of @xmath25 kpc and a pericentric distance of @xmath26  kpc , resulting in a nearly radial collision . to investigate the consequences of black hole growth and feedback , we have performed simulations that include centrally accreting bhs , and are labeled as such , and others that do not that are referred to as `` standard '' .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] shows six representative images of both types of galaxy mergers ( i.e. , with and without bhs ) .",
    "details of the morphology , dynamics and resulting star formation can be found elsewhere ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] also demonstrates the additional diffuse gas present when the merger includes an accreting black hole .",
    "owing to the energy put into the gas by the growing bhs , particularly during the final merger , a significant fraction of the gas participates in a large - scale galactic wind .",
    "this `` blowout '' phase is very efficient and star formation is almost completely shut off @xcite , leaving a remnant that quickly reddens and evolves nearly passively @xcite .",
    "moreover , as discussed further in the following section , the expulsion of the gas during the blowout greatly enhances the x - ray luminosity relative to cases in which no bh is present because not only is there additional gas throughout the halo , but this gas is highly metal - enriched .",
    "while a complete survey of the parameter space that describes the merger of two disk galaxies is beyond the scope of this work , it is important to understand how the production of hot gas depends on our initial assumptions . to this end , we merge disk galaxies with varying gas fractions and masses and describe the outcomes in section  [ sec : scalings ] .",
    "in this section we provide a detailed look at the evolution of hot gas and x - rays during one merger .",
    "while the x - ray luminosity , gas temperature and mass depend strongly on the initial halo size / mass and disk gas fraction ( discussed in   [ sec : scalings ] ) , the production of hot gas during a galaxy collision is a general feature of all our simulations .",
    "our analysis of the simulations assumes that x - rays are produced by the cooling of hot , diffuse gas . in reality , the observed x - ray emission has contributions from stellar sources such as supernova remnants and x - ray binaries , as well as accreting black holes and the hot phase of the interstellar medium .",
    "because the composite emission from these sources is generated mostly in the dense central regions of the galaxies , this luminosity may be heavily extinguished owing to the large column density of intervening gas and dust .",
    "in fact , as described by @xcite , we find that the central accreting bhs in merger simulations remain obscured for the majority of their active lifetimes .",
    "to simplify our analysis , we restrict ourselves to x - ray emission from the diffuse hot gas since it should be relatively unaffected by obscuration .",
    "we follow @xcite and assume the x - ray luminosity for each sph particle can be estimated from @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the proton mass , @xmath29 is the mean molecular weight ( 0.6 for a fully ionized primordial plasma ) , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the mass , density and temperature of the @xmath33 gas particle in cgs units , respectively .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : xlum_i ] ) assumes that the primary mechanism for x - ray emission is thermal bremsstrahlung , an assumption consistent with the zero - metallicity cooling included in the simulation .",
    "however , metal enriched gas with a temperature of @xmath34  k cools primarily through metal - line emission , a mechanism that is more efficient and would thus produce a much larger x - ray luminosity . in this sense ,",
    "the x - ray emission computed via equation ( [ eq : xlum_i ] ) is a lower limit .    in light of the increased x - ray luminosity expected from metal - enriched gas , we supplant equation  ( [ eq : xlum_i ] ) with x - ray emission calculated using a (",
    "* hereafter rs77 ) code that _ does _ include metal - line emission .",
    "the gas metallicity is provided by the star - formation model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assuming a metal yield of 2% , and we include emission from 0.1 to 2  kev .    the bolometric luminosity is then calculated according to @xmath35 where the sum is carried out over all gas particles with density below the critical density for star formation @xmath36 pc@xmath37 and a temperature greater than @xmath38  k. gas particles that meet these criteria are fully ionized ( for zero metallicity ) and are deemed `` hot '' or `` x - ray '' gas from hereafter .",
    "we note that our low temperature ( @xmath38  k ) threshold for gas to be included in the x - ray luminosity probes temperatures below current observational limits .",
    "however , this cut - off does serve as an accurate gauge of the amount of hot , ionized gas .",
    "figure  [ fig : boloxlum ] shows the bolometric x - ray luminosity as determined by equation  ( [ eq : bolox ] ) for the entire major merger . for both simulations ,",
    "two x - ray luminosities are shown .",
    "one , where the x - ray luminosity is calculated via equation  ( [ eq : xlum_i ] ) , in essence when the gas is assumed to have zero metallicity , and the second uses the rs77 code to include metal - line cooling .",
    "as expected , the inclusion of metallicity dependent cooling greatly enhances the x - ray emission produced during the galaxy merger .",
    "in addition , the spatial distribution of the x - ray emission is shown with overlaid contours in figure  [ fig : images ] .    initially , the x - ray emission from both galaxies is negligible because we ignore contributions from the star - forming interstellar medium .",
    "x - ray emission begins when the gas disks first interact , in shocks that lie directly between the two disks ( see @xmath39  gyr panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) . in general",
    ", the majority of the x - ray emission is produced by shock - heated gas , and thus the x - ray emission essentially tracks shocks that occur during the galaxy merger .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] also shows that when the galaxies separate , the x - ray emission is concentrated around the two galactic nuclei .",
    "this emission resembles that in observed systems that are in a similar dynamical state , such as the mice @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : images ] also demonstrates that when bhs are present , additional hot gas is generated by thermal feedback from bh accretion beginning at @xmath40  gyr .",
    "this results in an @xmath41 that is over an order of magnitude larger than the no - bh case .",
    "the excess x - ray emission from @xmath40  to 1.5 is generated by small - scale winds in the still - separated disks .",
    "these winds are , in general , collimated and escape perpendicular to the disk plane , similar to those shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig . 9 ) . in the simulations presented here",
    ", the winds are generated by the energy input by the accreting black holes and thus are present only in the bh simulations .",
    "collimated winds such as these are seen in many starbursting systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent features in figure  [ fig : boloxlum ] is the coincidence of the peak x - ray luminosity with the final merger , regardless of whether or not bhs are present .",
    "this x - ray emission results from the abundant shocks that occur as the gas disks attempt to follow the collisionless stellar nuclei .",
    "gas is heated to @xmath42  k and forced out of the central regions owing to shocks and pressure forces .",
    "hence , the x - ray luminosity is spatially extended , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : images ] from @xmath43  gyr .",
    "the maximum x - ray emission ranges from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ergs s@xmath20 , depending on the presence of a bh and if metallicity - dependent cooling is included .",
    "these luminosities are consistent with observations of the x - ray emission seen in interacting and merging systems @xcite as well as that expected on theoretical grounds @xcite . because the x - ray luminosity is a direct consequence of the collision between gas in each progenitor disk ,",
    "we expect a range of peak luminosities depending on the gas content in each galaxy , their ( relative and cumulative ) mass and the merger orbit .",
    "the mass and gas fraction dependence of @xmath41 is investigated further in   [ sec : scalings ] .",
    "after the galactic nuclei coalesce , at @xmath46  gyr , the x - ray luminosity decreases . when no bh is present , @xmath41 drops slowly as gas settles into hydrostatic equilibrium , and tidal material slowly returns to the remnant . however , when an accreting bh is included , the drop in @xmath41 is more pronounced owing to the `` blowout '' phase which expels a significant amount of metal - enriched , x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the eventual fate of gas caught up in the galactic wind is dictated by its energy relative to the depth of the galaxy potential well . in the simulation",
    "we describe in this section , a substantial amount of gas is injected with enough energy to completely unbind it from the remnant .",
    "however , even if a significant amount of gas is ejected from the system , the blowout does not leave the remnant completely devoid of gas .",
    "a substantial amount ( @xmath47% ) of the remaining gas remains bound to the remnant galaxy , is spread throughout the dark matter halo , and makes up the x - ray corona .",
    "+    figure  [ fig : gastime ] provides an accounting of the gas mass for mergers with and without accreting bhs .",
    "this figure also shows the mass of unbound ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) gas and the mass of gas that contributes to the x - ray luminosity .",
    "gas that is not unbound or x - ray emitting is typically cold and , depending on its density , star forming .",
    "consistent with the findings of @xcite there is little cold gas in the remnant that includes a bh and star formation is efficiently quenched subsequent to the merger at @xmath46  gyr .",
    "figure  [ fig : gastime ] demonstrates that the bh has a significant impact on the amount of x - ray and wind gas . owing to the merger - induced energy input from the bh , and the significant wind that ensues , the bh system has over 10 times the mass of unbound gas as compared to the no bh case .",
    "the bh feedback also contributes the x - ray gas and results in nearly 3 times the amount of mass as compared to when no bh is present . at first the differing amounts of x - ray gas in the two cases",
    "seem at odds with the identical x - ray luminosity ( for emission by thermal bremsstrahlung ) demonstrated in figure  [ fig : boloxlum ] . however , as shown in   [ ssec:3dprofs ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gas3d ] ) the gas within the inner 10  kpc of the remnant without a bh is over an order of magnitude denser than the no bh remnant and thus is more efficient at producing x - rays .",
    "we note that the thermal structure is quite similar between the two remnants , as is shown in   [ ssec : rem ] .",
    "the hot gas in the remnant relaxes on a timescale that is short when compared to that of the stellar component of the halo , as reflected by both the regularity of the x - ray isophotes ( see the bottom - right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : images ] ) and the steady x - ray luminosity after @xmath49  gyr , a little more than 1.5 gyr after the merger . in contrast ,",
    "stellar material in tidal tails is accreted by the remnant to produce long - lived shells , loops , and other fine structure @xcite by `` phase - wrapping '' @xcite .",
    "similar features are seen around many ellipticals @xcite . because this debris is on nearly radial orbits , gas in the tails is stripped out and deposited in the halo or inner regions of the remnant @xcite , and the shells quickly redden .",
    "+    the bh - driven wind is also efficient at dispersing metals .",
    "because the blowout is triggered by the centrally located bh , gas that is ejected from the system has been significantly enriched by metals . to demonstrate this",
    "more explicitly we refer to figure  [ fig : xraygas ] . plotted are contours of the gas density at @xmath50  gyr , shortly after the first passage of the two disks .",
    "overlaid are ( @xmath51 ) dots that denote the gas particles that will eventually constitute the hot x - ray emitting gaseous halo .",
    "when no bh is present , the gas in the x - ray halo was once almost exclusively composed of loosely bound tidal material . in these low - density regions , little star formation occurs and thus metal enrichment is only modest . while this same loosely bound tidal material will make it into the x - ray halo of the bh remnant",
    ", the majority of the x - ray gas in this case comes from gas that was once more centrally concentrated .",
    "this gas is spread throughout the disk and has been significantly enriched by star formation .    for the bh merger shown in figure  [ fig : xraygas ] , x - ray gas in the remnant",
    "has an x - ray weighted mean metallicity of 0.9 solar .",
    "the unbound wind material has an even higher metallicity , nearly twice solar . in this sense",
    ", the wind could be considered `` mass loaded . ''",
    "the high metallicity of the gas suggests that the wind is made up primarily of the densest , most metal - rich gas .",
    "in contrast , without the energy input from a bh , the x - ray gas is 1/10  , and the small amount of unbound gas is less than 1/20  . without the energy input from the bh essentially the entire metal budget is locked in stars or star - forming gas .",
    "the dispersal of metals by the wind also has a profound influence on the x - ray emission . because the metallicity of the x - ray - emitting gas is nearly 10 times larger in the bh remnant as compared to the standard remnant",
    ", the x - ray luminosity is greatly increased .",
    "we show the x - ray luminosity when metal - line cooling is considered in figure  [ fig : boloxlum ] .",
    "we hereafter restrict our analysis to x - ray emission calculated using the metal - line cooling of rs77 .      because galaxies encompass a range of masses , studies of the x - ray emission caused by galaxy interactions have typically normalized the x - ray emission by the @xmath0-band luminosity of the host galaxy @xcite . in order to facilitate a more direct comparison to these studies ,",
    "we show /  for our mergers in figure  [ fig : lxlbtime ] . for simplicity , we ignore the effects of extinction when computing .",
    "this approximation is likely to be valid during the post - merger phases but may dramatically overestimate the luminosity during the highly obscured merger stage . in any case",
    ", many of the features in /  are very similar to those of just ( shown in fig .  [ fig : boloxlum ] ) .",
    "this result is not surprising given the moderate gas fraction of our progenitor disks , and hence the modest fraction of stellar mass that is produced during the merger . for the most part ,",
    "slowly decreases over time owing to an aging stellar population .    both  and /  ( figs .",
    "[ fig : boloxlum ] and [ fig : lxlbtime ] , respectively ) demonstrate a characteristic rise and fall of x - ray emission .",
    "the peak of this emission is coincident with the merger , a trend that is also seen observationally ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig . 13 ) .",
    "one discrepancy may be the decline from the peak which is larger in the simulations than the observations .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : boloxlum ] shows a wide range of peak luminosities depending on the presence of a bh and the metallicity of the gas .",
    "the luminosities will also fluctuate owing to the gas content of the progenitor disks as well as the merger orbit , complicating a quantitative comparison with the observations .",
    "we can also compare the x - ray luminosity from the simulations subsequent to the merger to the study of disturbed ellipticals by @xcite .",
    "these authors determined that /  steadily increases with remnant age when age is measured by the fine structure parameter @xmath52 @xcite and is zero at the last merger event .",
    "the slope of the best - fit relation by osullivan et al . is shown as a short line in figure  [ fig : lxlbtime ] ( `` ofp01 '' ) .",
    "the shallowness of this x - ray evolution demonstrates that the increase of /  over time is a very subtle effect and that the hot gaseous halos of elliptical galaxies are grown over long periods of time .    for the simulation that includes bhs ,",
    "the /  ratio is nearly constant after the merger , a by - product of the equivalent fading of both  and . while we followed each remnant for only a short period of time after the merger and the isolated nature of the galaxies in our simulations make the long term luminosity evolution fairly uncertain",
    ", it does not appear that our remnant /increases at the same rate as observed merger remnants .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] the `` merger hypothesis '' posits that the interaction and merger of two spiral galaxies leads to the formation of an elliptical .",
    "in general , our simulations support this picture as we are left with a spheroidal stellar component surrounded by a halo of hot , x - ray - emitting gas , similar to observed elliptical galaxies . in this section",
    "we investigate this in more detail by directly comparing the x - ray emission of our remnants to observations of post - merger and relaxed elliptical galaxies .    to begin , we show the x - ray surface brightness in figure  [ fig : xraysb ] .",
    "the emission is calculated using the rs77 metal - line cooling and is azimuthally averaged from 100 random viewing directions .",
    "the presence of bhs has a significant impact on the shape and radial extent of the x - ray emission .",
    "apparently , energy injected by the bh decreases the emission on small scales ( @xmath53  kpc ) , and increases the emission on large scales ( @xmath54  kpc ) . in both cases",
    ", however , there is detectable emission to @xmath55  kpc .",
    "it is common practice to fit the observed x - ray surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies to a beta model of the form @xmath56^{-3\\beta+0.5 } , \\label{eq : beta}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the central surface brightness , @xmath58 is the core radius , and @xmath59 quantifies the slope at large projected radii .",
    "we fit equation  ( [ eq : beta ] ) to the surface brightness of our remnants and find the best fit to yield @xmath60 and @xmath61  kpc for the bh remnant and @xmath62 and @xmath63  kpc for the remnant without a bh .",
    "we note that the above fit was performed over the entire surface brightness profile , which includes emission out to @xmath55  kpc . at these radii ,",
    "the x - ray surface brightness is over 5 orders of magnitude fainter than the central regions .",
    "this large dynamic range is nearly 3 orders of magnitude more than is probed by the standard integration time of observations .",
    "thus , a more realistic comparison can be achieved by restricting our fits to radii where the x - ray surface brightness is within 2 orders of magnitude of the peak .",
    "this corresponds to 12 and 50 kpc for the standard and bh remnant , respectively . in this case , we find @xmath64 and @xmath65  kpc for the bh remnant and @xmath66 and @xmath67  kpc for the remnant without a bh .",
    "the @xmath59-profile fits restricted to the inner surface brightness profiles are in much better agreement with observations than the unrestricted fits . observed merger remnants have measured @xmath59 values between 0.5 and 1.15 @xcite .",
    "we also note the much flatter profile and larger core radius of the bh remnant .",
    "these features are observed in several x - ray faint early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition to the x - ray surface brightness profile , an increasing number of galaxies have well determined temperature and metallicity profiles . acquiring",
    "this information has been possible with the high spatial and spectral resolution of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , as well as the proper accounting of point sources and complex modeling of the hot x - ray emitting plasma . in particular ,",
    "recent work has shown that multi - temperature plasma models provide a much better fit to the data and result in a larger estimate for the hot gas metallicity @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaszt ] shows the temperature ( @xmath70 ) and metallicity ( @xmath71 ) profiles for our merger remnants .",
    "regardless of the presence of bhs , the temperature is approximately isothermal within @xmath7210  kpc , and a strongly decreasing function at larger radii .",
    "the additional energy injected by the bh uniformly heats the gas at all radii without affecting the slope .",
    "however , inside of @xmath73  kpc , the temperature difference is much larger owing to different cooling times of the hot gas . without a bh , gas has a shorter cooling time and a cool(er ) core has formed . in contrast , the energy input by the bh generates a hot(ter ) cusp .",
    "we note that these curves are expected to have some time variability since gas has cooling times less than the hubble time in both instances ( see   [ ssec:3dprofs ] ) .    in comparison to the temperature ,",
    "the differences in the metallicity profiles are much more striking .",
    "as described earlier , the bh induced galactic wind is `` mass - loaded '' and transports a significant amount of metals to large radii .",
    "this metal - rich wind results in an _ increasing _ metallicity profile .",
    "the largest radial bin is supersolar and the most metal rich . as we showed in ",
    "[ ssec : time ] , the trend of increasing metallicity with radius continues to the unbound wind material as well . without a bh ,",
    "metals are retained very near to where they are produced and hence the metallicity profile is flat or slightly decreases .    the majority of the spatially resolved data exists for x - ray luminous early - type galaxies .",
    "these systems typically have nearly isothermal temperature profiles and metallicity gradients , although there is very often a slight decrease in temperature at small or large radii , or both @xcite . at first glance",
    ", the profiles presented in figure  [ fig : gaszt ] appear to be at odds with the observed trends .",
    "however , as we mentioned previously , restricting our analysis to the inner regions would render the temperature profile much closer to isothermal .",
    "the metallicity gradient may be indicative of mixing between metal - rich gas produced during the merger and diffuse low - metallicity gas that is accreted by the galaxy , a process that is not included in the present simulations .",
    "we also note that x - ray luminous galaxies are generally large ellipticals , and thus our comparison is best directed toward merger remnants , which , because they are x - ray faint , do not usually have measured temperature or metallicity profiles .",
    "one generic feature of observed ellipticals and merger remnants is the near solar metallicity of x - ray gas @xcite .",
    "this is generally reproduced in the simulations that include a bh .",
    "because the no - bh merger produces an x - ray halo of low metallicity , this suggests a mechanism to produce the low metallicities observed in a few x - ray faint ellipticals @xcite . this could occur if black hole growth is inefficient , as would be the case if the progenitors are gas - poor , or if the emission is so faint that one could only detect the central part of the rising metallicity profile present in the bh remnant .",
    "figure  [ fig : gas3d ] shows the spherically averaged gas density ( @xmath70 ) , cooling time ( @xmath74 ) , and entropy ( @xmath71 ) for x - ray gas and provides a general picture of the state of hot gas in the merger remnants . while the remnant profiles are quite similar regardless of the presence of bhs , there is a distinct transition at @xmath75  kpc . inside of this radius , gas in the no - bh remnant has a higher density , and thus a significantly shorter cooling time , and lower entropy .",
    "outside of this radius , the trend reverses , mirroring what was seen in the x - ray surface brightness profiles in figure  [ fig : xraysb ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the temperature and metallicity profiles shown in figure  [ fig : gaszt ] do not show a break . in this case",
    ", the bh remnant has a higher temperature and metallicity at _ all _ radii .",
    "together , these trends suggest that feedback from the bh has pumped energy and metals into the gaseous component and affected diffuse gas at all radii . in response to this injection of energy",
    ", gas flows outward ( and some even escapes in a wind ) , filling more of the dark matter halo than when no bh is present .",
    "even though gas that is located at @xmath76  kpc is relatively similar in temperature and density in both the bh and no - bh cases , there is a significant difference in the cooling times , caused by the higher metallicity of gas in the bh remnant .",
    "in fact , much of the existing x - ray halo would cool within the next several gyr in this model .",
    "finally , the spherical gas profiles display kinks at @xmath77  kpc .",
    "while very pronounced in the cooling time and entropy profiles , this kink exists in some form in all the profiles , both projected and spherical .",
    "features such as this are quite common in the simulations with bhs and result from a small number of residual cold gas clumps within the inner few kpc .",
    "because hot gas is generated by shocks that attend the disk - galaxy collision , and is bolstered by feedback from black hole accretion , it is natural to expect that the x - ray emission will depend on the amount of gas present in the progenitor disk galaxies as well as their masses .",
    "to understand this relationship better , we perform a series of merger simulations that span a range of progenitor gas fractions and masses as well as the orbits by which the disk galaxies merge .",
    "all the progenitor disk galaxies used for this parameter exploration have identical halo properties such as concentration , spin parameter , and mass fraction . while holding these properties constant , we systematically change the disk gas fraction or virial velocity , or both . in total",
    ", we construct three halos smaller ( @xmath78 , 80 , and @xmath79  km  s@xmath20 ) than our fiducial model ( @xmath19  km  s@xmath20 ) and three that are larger ( @xmath80 , 320 , and @xmath81  km  s@xmath20 ) .",
    "these virial velocities correspond to total masses spanning 5.8@xmath82 - 4.2@xmath83 , a range of nearly 3 orders of magnitude . for each galaxy",
    "the exponential disk composes 4.1% of the total mass , with a fixed fraction @xmath22 in a collisional gaseous component .",
    "the compound galaxies are realized with 500,000 particles to represent the dark matter and 50,000 to represent the disk . since the disk comprises both stellar and gaseous components ,",
    "a fraction @xmath24 are considered gas and the remainder represent the collisionless stellar disk . in what follows",
    "we investigate four values of @xmath22 , 0.05 , 0.2 , 0.4 , and 0.8 .",
    "black holes are included in all of the simulations described in this section and the x - ray emission is calculated using the metallicity - dependent rs77 model .",
    "before we begin our exploration of the effects of varying the progenitor mass and gas fraction , we wish to determine if the fully co - planar progenitor disk orientations and radial orbit of our fiducial disk - galaxy merger significantly affect the resultant x - ray luminosity , discussed at length in   [ sec : onemerger ] . to this end ,",
    "we merged the identical progenitor disks on the fiducial orbit with three alternate disk orientations . besides our fiducial co - planar orientation ( @xmath84 )",
    ", we also simulated a tilted orientation ( @xmath85 ) , another tilted orientation ( @xmath86 ) , and a polar orientation ( @xmath87 ) , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the standard spherical coordinates , and the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the two progenitor disks . the x - ray evolution for these runs is presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig : lxoo ] . in the right panel of this figure , we show the x - ray evolution for our fiducial progenitor disk and fiducial orientation merging on six orbits with different angular momenta , one with less and five with more .",
    "together , the orbits and orientations presented in figure  [ fig : lxoo ] display a range of x - ray luminosities . at any particular time ,  may differ by over an order of magnitude .",
    "much of this variability is attributable to the effect that orbits and orientations have on the consumption of gas , and thus the effective gas fraction at the time the galaxies interact .",
    "an additional factor is the growth of the black hole , as larger black holes will input more energy and produce additional hot gas .    to understand how the progenitor gas fraction influences the x - ray luminosity without the complications associated with various orbits and orientations , we resimulate the fiducial merger while systematically varying the progenitor gas fraction .",
    "the resultant x - ray evolution is presented in figure  [ fig : lxgfs ] . as the progenitor gas fraction increases",
    ", the peak x - ray luminosity also increases .",
    "there is also an increase in  prior to the merger , from @xmath90  to 1.8  gyr , owing to the larger bhs and additional hot gas produced by their feedback .",
    "because the bh feedback drives a powerful wind in the high gas fraction mergers , the x - ray luminosity drops subsequent to the peak .",
    "there is very little difference in the remnant x - ray emission for gas fractions greater than 20% .    for the lowest gas fraction progenitor in figure  [ fig : lxgfs ]",
    "the x - ray emission is very small prior to the final merger .",
    "many of these trends with gas fraction can be understood in terms of the feedback provided by the bh driving a large scale wind . as the gas fraction ( and black hole mass ) increase the wind becomes dominant and affects a larger amount of gas .",
    "thus , the temperature and entropy of the remnant gas steadily increase in remnants with larger progenitor gas fractions .",
    "these effects will be the subject of future work that details the winds produced by black hole feedback ( hopkins et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the last dependency we explicitly address is progenitor mass . for this",
    ", we merge galaxies with a variety of masses on orbits that are self - similar , i.e. the pericentric distance is scaled in proportion to the size of each disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : lxmass ] presents the x - ray evolution during these mergers . in all instances ,",
    "the progenitor gas fraction was 80% .",
    "there is a regular progression for more massive progenitors to produce more x - ray emission .",
    "this is to be expected , if gas settles into hydrostatic equilibrium in each remnant halo .",
    "there is also a subtle difference between the maximum x - ray luminosity and the remnant x - ray luminosity .",
    "both the most and least massive galaxies have relatively little difference between the maximum and remnant , while moderate masses have a large difference .",
    "this trend results from two competing effects .",
    "first , the impact of black hole feedback varies with system mass in a differential manner @xcite , being increasingly more violent for more massive galaxies .",
    "second , the gas consumption is much more efficient for more massive systems @xcite and thus they have lower effective gas fractions .    finally , we summarize the production of x - rays and hot gas during the various disk - galaxy major mergers by compiling a number of global quantities for each merger remnant .",
    "in order to characterize the x - ray luminosity we determine the peak and remnant  for each galaxy merger .",
    "we also find the mass of gas that composes the hot x - ray halo and the mass of gas that becomes unbound from the galaxy potential owing to the black hole feedback - induced blowout .",
    "these global quantities are shown in figure  [ fig : scalings ] for our entire merger series , which includes the seven different mass initial conditions , four initial disk gas fractions , and four disk orientations .",
    "the scatter resulting from the four initial disk orientations simulated is shown by the @xmath91 error bars for all quantities .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ fig : scalings ] demonstrate what was also apparent in figure  [ fig : lxmass ] , namely , that more massive galaxy mergers produce more x - ray luminosity .",
    "for a self - similar model we expect @xmath92 , which is close to what is present in the simulated remnants .",
    "there is , however , a slight flattening at high @xmath15 , which reflects the more efficient star formation and thus less relative gas in these systems .",
    "apparent in the middle panels of figure  [ fig : scalings ] is a trend for low - mass mergers to produce more unbound material .",
    "this is opposite to the trend found for x - ray gas mass , where the most massive systems have a larger fraction .",
    "both trends hold across all progenitor gas fractions investigated .",
    "however , there is a systematic increase in the fraction of unbound gas with progenitor gas fraction .",
    "this trend reflects the increased wind efficiency induced by the black hole feedback for these systems .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : scalings ] show the metallicity of the x - ray and unbound gas . in nearly all the remnants ,",
    "both the unbound and x - ray gas have solar or supersolar metallicity .",
    "there is a slight decrease in metallicity at high masses , as these systems have very short gas consumption timescales @xcite .",
    "thus many of the metals become locked up in the stars , producing a correlation between remnant mass and stellar metallicity .",
    "the previous section demonstrates that galaxy mergers produce significant x - ray emission and that each merger remnant contains hot , x - ray emitting gas .",
    "however , we have not addressed whether this x - ray emission is comparable to observed ellipticals .",
    "observations indicate that merger remnants are underluminous when compared with elliptical galaxies and that ellipticals build their x - ray emission slowly , over the course of several gyr @xcite . in this section",
    "we compare our merger remnants to common scaling relations for elliptical galaxies and speculate on their future evolution .",
    "one of the most common relations used in the study of x - ray emission from individual galaxies is the -  relation .",
    "figure  [ fig : lxlb ] shows our entire series of gas fraction and size / mass remnants ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : scalings ] ) in the -  plane . also shown on this plot as",
    "points are data from @xcite and luminous ellipticals from @xcite as crosses . the dot - dashed line ( with the shallower slope ) that demarcates the lower bound of observed galaxies is an estimate of the point source contribution to the total x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "galaxies that reside near this line have x - ray emission that is presumably dominated by point sources . shown with a dashed line of slope @xmath93 is the best - fit relation for luminous ellipticals from @xcite .",
    "our merger remnants trace out an arc that passes through the observed galaxies .",
    "because we have not included any contribution to the x - ray luminosity from point sources , the low - mass remnants fall well below the observations .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that these systems radiate little diffuse gas emission or that the diffuse gas is too cold to be easily detected .",
    "our moderate ( @xmath94 ) galaxies are very comparable to observed ellipticals , while the higher  systems are underluminous .",
    "the comparison between observed ellipticals and our remnants is muddled by two facts , one is the uncertain  owing to the unknown star formation history of stars that are formed before we begin our simulation , and the second is the baryon fraction of our initial disk galaxies , which we assume is less than one - third of the cosmic mean .    to address the first point , we assume that stars present at the beginning of the simulation have been steadily formed during the 5  gyr prior to our @xmath95 .",
    "metallicities are selected randomly between solar and 1/10 solar and  is calculated using the models of @xcite .",
    "we also note that the stopping point for our simulations is arbitrary .",
    "an additional 5 gyr of evolution would decrease  by another factor of 2 .",
    "the second point above , the initial baryon fraction , is particularly relevant for our most massive systems , whose closest analogs are probably groups rather than individual galaxies .",
    "groups tend to have baryon fractions closer to the cosmic mean value @xcite and thus it may not be surprising that these remnants are underluminous .",
    "we also find it intriguing that x - ray emission is only detected in groups that have at least one early - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "this correlation naturally arises when the x - ray emission and early - type galaxy are formed in a common process , as we suggest here .",
    "figure  [ fig : lxtx ] shows the remnant x - ray luminosity versus x - ray - weighted average temperature for our merger remnants in the -  plane .",
    "the -  relation is commonly used to study x - ray emission from clusters , groups , and more recently , elliptical galaxies . the best - fit relation for ellipticals appears to have an offset in both slope and normalization from the relations found for groups and clusters ( which themselves are not identical ) , indicating that these systems have had an injection of energy ( or entropy ) above that expected from purely self - similar gravitational collapse ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "on this figure we also plot the data of @xcite , which consists primarily of luminous ellipticals , as crosses , and their best - fit relation which has a slope of 4.8 .",
    "the majority of the remnants are overluminous when compared to the observed -  relation , while the most massive remnants are underluminous .",
    "the only remnants that appear to match the observed data well are the remnants of mergers between disks with 80% initial gas fractions .",
    "the discrepancy for the most massive remnants appears to be that they are simply underluminous , as this is the case for -   as well as - .",
    "however , most of the other merger remnants appear consistent with the observed -  relation , and thus it is unclear whether they are really overluminous or whether their temperature is underestimated . the latter scenario could arise because of the radial temperature gradient present in most of the simulations . hence , using a smaller aperture to measure the x - ray temperature or only detecting the central emission will yield higher than that measured here .      as a final comparison , we plot the x - ray temperature against the stellar central velocity dispersion in figure  [ fig : sigtx ] . as discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : lxtx ] ,  is the mean x - ray weighted gas temperature and , as shown in ",
    "[ ssec : rem ] , is a decreasing function of radius .",
    "the central stellar velocity dispersion is measured within the half - mass radius from 100 random projections .",
    "the typical @xmath91 error owing to projection effects is @xmath7210% .",
    "provided that both the gas and stars are relaxed and in equilibrium , both @xmath15 and  are a measure of the system potential .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : sigtx ] is a dashed line expected when the gas and stars are in equipartition , i.e. , @xmath96 where @xmath29 is the mean mass per particle , and @xmath97 is the proton mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigtx ] plots @xmath15 versus  for our series of merger remnants . in general",
    ", there exists a tight relation between @xmath15 and  for high mass remnants , signifying that these systems contain gas that is in hydrostatic equilibrium throughout the remnant halo .",
    "there exists a trend for low - mass systems to peel away from the @xmath15-  relation .",
    "in particular , the remnants produced by gas - rich mergers show the largest discrepancy .",
    "these remnants are also strongly affected by the bh feedback ( see , e.g. , the amount of unbound gas mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalings ] ) and their high temperature reflects this additional energy input .",
    "overall , our model for the production of x - ray emission during the merger of two equal mass disk galaxies successfully matches the rise and fall of x - ray emission observed for the toomre sequence @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the x - ray luminosity of the merger remnants span a wide range that depends on the initial disk gas fraction and size / mass . compared to observed early - type galaxies of equivalent , our models are broadly consistent with the data for log()@xmath98  , and underluminous for more massive remnants . however , because the hot gas is generally consistent with the -  and @xmath15-relations , we argue that a disk - galaxy merger that includes the feedback from accreting supermassive bhs is a sufficient mechanism to produce hot gas in the correct `` state , '' i.e. , metal - rich and in hydrostatic equilibrium , but in some cases there is simply not _ enough _ of this gas .",
    "as stated in the introduction , three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the growth of a luminous x - ray halo for elliptical galaxies , infalling tidal material , the reacquisition of material ejected in a galactic wind during the formation of the elliptical , and stellar mass loss .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn .",
    "one definitive conclusion from our simulations is that infalling tidal material contributes very little to the remnant x - ray emission . while tidal material continues to rain down on the remnant long ( @xmath99  gyr ) after the nuclei have coalesced ,",
    "the mass of these cold tidal tails is small ( @xmath100 ) compared to the mass of hot diffuse gas already in place .",
    "not only is the mass in the tidal material not sufficient to significantly alter the x - ray luminosity , but the efficiency at which this infalling cold gas is converted to x - ray - emitting hot gas is less than @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the diffuse hot gas is largely in place soon after the merger , as demonstrated in the @xmath102  gyr panel of figure [ fig : images ] , and the tidal material serves only to `` top off '' the amount of hot gas .",
    "this is consistent with the theory that shells around ellipticals form from accreted tidal debris @xcite , because the stellar luminosity of these features is small compared with that of the host galaxies .      within the context of the simulations we present , only the mergers that include bhs and produce a wind",
    "have a reservoir of ejected gas to reacquire .",
    "this is evidenced by figures  [ fig : gastime ] and [ fig : scalings ] , which show that the galactic wind is ubiquitous in small - mass halos and depends on the initial disk gas fraction . in some cases",
    ", the wind contains more mass than that which remains in the x - ray halo .    of course , all of our remnants will also accrete pristine gas through the hierarchical growth of structure , which we do not follow here .",
    "this gas is likely to be acquired by infall from the ambient intergalactic medium ( which may be pre - enriched at a low level ) or via discrete subunits .",
    "however , the high metallicity observed in the halos of hot gas around local ellipticals @xcite suggests that this is not the dominant mechanism to form the diffuse x - ray halo .",
    "re - acquiring metal - enriched wind material allows for the growth of the x - ray halo while also maintaining a high metallicity .",
    "it is also possible that the enriched wind material will mix with the ambient intergalactic medium , thereby diluting its metallicity .",
    "effects such as this may be responsible for the scatter in the observed metallicities of x - ray halos or in radial metallicity gradients .      owing to the large population of stars formed during the merger , we expect a significant contribution to the hot gas content from ongoing stellar mass loss . the generation of diffuse hot gas from stellar mass loss has been discussed extensively in the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is generally punctuated by a brief period of outflows triggered by ongoing type i supernovae and stellar mass loss , followed by an extended period ( @xmath75  gyr ) in which gas is retained , and the hot gaseous halo then builds up .",
    "we emphasize that this `` wind '' is in addition to and would follow the galactic wind induced by bh feedback .",
    "this long timescale for the build up of the x - ray halo is consistent with the observations of elliptical galaxies and merger remnants , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "while our merger simulations do not alter this picture , they do provide a physically motivated initial condition that includes the mass of young stars .    for the simulations we study here , the majority of the gas initially present in the progenitor galaxies",
    "is consumed by star formation .",
    "thus the mass of young stars is typically 3 - 4 times that of the hot gas , which is either in the x - ray halo or unbound . while the amount of mass that is recycled from new stars back into the interstellar medium depends on the assumed initial mass function ; if , for example , we assume a value of @xmath103% , then stellar mass loss will contribute an amount of hot gas that is roughly equivalent to what already exists from the merger alone .",
    "a generic feature of the merger simulations that include feedback from an accreting black hole is the production of a large - scale outflow of metal - enriched gas .",
    "this outflow carries a significant fraction of the available gas mass and eventually deposits this gas throughout the halo and in some cases out of the galactic potential .",
    "winds such as these may play a significant role in redistributing metals and may be required in order to terminate star formation and produce red ellipticals @xcite .",
    "observationally , there is evidence that winds such as these exist ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low redshift",
    ", winds are mainly observed in starburst galaxies via metal - line absorption and emission studies .",
    "it has been shown that there is a correlation between the outflow rate and the star formation rate and that some of these winds are powerful enough to escape the galaxy @xcite . at high redshift ,",
    "evidence for large - scale outflows comes from blueshifted absorption lines , redshifted ly@xmath104 emission lines @xcite , and the excess of civ absorption systems and a deficit of neutral hydrogen near lyman break galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear how closely the winds produced in the simulations resemble observed winds .",
    "we note that understanding these winds in more detail may require embedding our simulations in a diffuse intergalactic medium , as many of the observations are actually a signature of the interaction between the wind and the local diffuse medium .",
    "this fact should be kept in mind when interpreting the fractional wind material presented in figure  [ fig : scalings ] .",
    "theoretical models predict that all galaxy halos , including those of spirals , should contain some hot gas component , yet it is currently unclear if these hot gas halos are observed @xcite . in any case , including diffuse gas will provide a backstop against which the outflowing gas will interact , causing it to thermalize some of its energy , slow down , and possibly decrease the amount of outflowing material .",
    "we have performed one simulation in which both initial disks included a diffuse gaseous halo with one - quarter the baryonic mass . in this experiment",
    "the wind punched through the diffuse gas , and this resulted in very little difference from the case without any diffuse gas .",
    "more work will be necessary to determine how the wind interacts with diffuse gas and to compare these simulations to the observations .    as a final point",
    ", we note that the absence of these outflows in simulations without black holes does not mean that winds are only produced by accreting black hole feedback .",
    "this is quite apparent observationally , where systems such as m82 contain significant outflows and a corresponding starburst , but there is no evidence for an accreting black hole . in our simulations",
    "the outflows are produced by point - like energy injection and one could easily consider other formulations of star formation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that would also produce galactic outflows .",
    "our hydrodynamic simulations show that collisions between gas - rich disk galaxies generate appreciable x - ray emission .",
    "this emission comes from hot diffuse gas that is produced by strong shocks attending the merger process .",
    "the presence of an accreting black hole increases the x - ray luminosity during the merger through the production of a hot , metal - rich galactic wind .",
    "this galactic wind transports a significant fraction of metals from the galactic center to the diffuse gaseous halo and outside the potential well of the remnant galaxy .",
    "the wind - induced metal enrichment appears to be necessary to reproduce the near solar metallicity of observed ellipticals @xcite .",
    "transporting metals out of the galaxy potential well may also help explain the high metallicity of the intra - group and intra - cluster media and the apparent deficit of baryons in lower mass galaxies .",
    "our merger remnants span a wide range of luminosities , yet are broadly consistent with x - ray properties of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this result suggests that galaxy mergers are a viable mechanism for generating the observed hot gas present in most interacting and merging systems .",
    "in addition , we argue that both stellar mass loss and the reacquisition of galactic wind material are viable mechanisms to increase the luminosity of the diffuse x - ray halo .",
    "this paper shows that galaxy mergers may play an integral role in the production of the hot , metal - rich gaseous halos that are present in most luminous elliptical galaxies . using simulations similar to ours ,",
    "recent studies demonstrate that gas - rich galaxy mergers that include black hole accretion and feedback can reproduce the black hole mass- central velocity dispersion relation @xcite and the colors @xcite , fundamental plane @xcite , and kinematics of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "together , these results provide strong evidence for a `` cosmic cycle '' ( see fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of galaxy formation and evolution , in which gas - rich galaxy mergers and the growth of supermassive black holes play key roles .",
