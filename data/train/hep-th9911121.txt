    "<S> starting from the fierz transform of the two - flavour t hooft interaction ( a four - fermion lagrangian with antisymmetric lorentz tensor interaction terms augmented by an njl type lorentz scalar interaction responsible for dynamical symmetry breaking and quark mass generation ) , we show that : ( 1 ) antisymmetric tensor nambu - goldstone bosons appear provided that the scalar and tensor couplings stand in the proportion of two to one , which ratio appears naturally in the fierz transform of the two - flavour t hooft interaction ; ( 2 ) non - abelian vector gauge bosons coupled to this system acquire a non - zero mass . </S>",
    "<S> axial - vector fields do not mix with antisymmetric tensor fields , so there is no mass shift there . </S>"
