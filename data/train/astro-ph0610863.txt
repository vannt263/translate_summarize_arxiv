    "the globular cluster 037b327 is an extremely red non - stellar object close to the disk of m31 .",
    "@xcite calculated its reddening , using photometry in the compiled catalog of m31 globular clusters of @xcite , to be @xmath0  mag , and from this inferred that it was extremely luminous , with @xmath1  mag , making it the most luminous globular cluster in m31 .",
    "the recent compilation of data for m31 globular clusters by the bologna group @xcite also confirms the unusual properties of this object .",
    "recently @xcite have studied this cluster in more detail .",
    "they compare their new multicolor photometry to theoretical spectral energy distributions of varying ages to determine the reddening and age of this cluster .",
    "they find that it has a photometric mass of @xmath2 ; they then claim this object to be the most massive star cluster of any age in the local group .",
    "this claim is based in part on data from the compiled catalogs of @xcite for the m31 system and of @xcite for the milky way globular cluster system . @xcite",
    "predict that m31  037b327 has a 1d velocity dispersion of @xmath3  km  s@xmath4 ,   far larger than that of any other known m31 globular cluster .",
    "velocity dispersions for a number of the brightest globular clusters in m31 were determined by @xcite ; the highest value they measured was @xmath5  km  s@xmath4 , for m31 g1 .",
    "we have obtained high spectral resolution spectra with hires at keck @xcite of m31  037b327 and of m31  g1 , as well as of several metal - rich giants on the upper rgb of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy which served as template stars .",
    "we took two 1500 sec exposures of the object of interest , one 600 sec exposure of the much brighter ( at @xmath7 ) object m31  g1 , and several suitable spectra of template red giants from the same run in early september 2006 .",
    "all these spectra were taken with a @xmath8 slit , giving a spectral resolution of 35,000 with 5 pixels / spectral resolution element ( @xmath91.3  km sec@xmath4 pixel@xmath4 ) .",
    "we chose for analysis parts of three different echelle orders with strong broadened spectral features visible in the spectrum of m31  037b327 . since the flux for this object was dropping rapidly towards the blue , but the number of strong lines was dropping rapidly towards the red , this was something of a compromise .",
    "cutouts of the spectra in one of the regions analyzed , that near h@xmath10 , are shown for the two m31 globular clusters and one of the template objects in fig .",
    "[ figure_vsigma ] .",
    "it is immediately apparent that @xmath6 for m31  037b327 is comparable to that of m31  g1 , but is not significantly larger . this impression is sustained when one examines the strongest lines in these spectra over their full useful wavelength range , which for the object of interest is from about 5100 to 8350   .",
    "we used the fourier quotient method of @xcite to determine @xmath6 .",
    "we subsequently applied an aperture correction factor of 1.14 following @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath6 are given in table  [ table_vsigma ] .",
    "our measured @xmath6 for m31  g1 is in good agreement with that of @xcite , @xmath11  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "m31  g1 , if one ignores m31",
    "037b327 , is widely believed to be the most luminous globular cluster in m31 , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested , based on hst / stis spectroscopy , that it contains a 20,000  @xmath12  central black hole .",
    "@xcite dispute this ; they obtain a good fit to all available data for g1 with their dynamical model , which does not include an intermediate - mass central black hole .",
    "@xcite utilize an acs image from hst to determine the structural parameters of m31  037b327 , and discuss the possibility , suggested earlier by @xcite , that this object is the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy accreted by m31 .",
    "the acs image reveals a dust lane crossing the face of the cluster .",
    "toy models of a uniform extinction over most of the cluster with much larger @xmath13 over a smaller part of the cluster suggest substantial errors in the values of the dereddened fluxes can occur in such circumstances if a standard extinction curve as a function of wavelength is applied assuming a constant @xmath13 .",
    "the reddening of g1 is small as it has a projected distance from the center of m31 of @xmath940 kpc ; we assume only the foreground galactic reddening applies .",
    "we compare the properties of m31  037b327 with those of g1 .",
    "the values of @xmath6 are comparable ( see table  [ table_vsigma ] ) , with that of g1 perhaps being slightly larger .",
    "since the reddening of m31  037b327 is large and spatially variable across the face of the cluster , we prefer to compare the luminosities at @xmath14 where the impact of the reddening is minimized .",
    "we assume both objects are old stellar clusters .",
    "this comparison is sure to be more reliable than a similar one making the same assumption carried out at @xmath7 by @xcite which suggested that m31  037b327 is a factor of @xmath92.5 times more luminous than g1 .    in late september 2006",
    "we acquired an image at @xmath14 of the field of m31  037b327 with the wide field infrared camera @xcite at the hale telescope on palomar mountain to verify the ir photometry of this cluster .",
    "we find @xmath15  mag in the 2mass @xcite system for an aperture @xmath16 in diameter .",
    "this is within 0.01  mag of that derived from the 2mass database by @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 for g1 from 2mass as reported by @xcite is 0.025 mag fainter than that of m31  037b327 .",
    "if one takes @xmath13 for the heavily reddened cluster m31  037b327 as @xmath18  mag with a more realistic error than that adopted by @xcite , given the spatially varying reddening , of @xmath19  mag , then the m31  037b327 has @xmath20 brighter by 0.16@xmath21 mag .",
    "we thus find that m31  037b327 has @xmath22 comparable to that of g1 and at most 20% larger , even allowing for a generous uncertainty in @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath20 is well known to be a good measure of the total luminosity for old stellar systems ; the dependence of @xmath23 on [ fe / h ] is smaller at 2.4@xmath24 than at optical wavelengths .    in order to determine the virial mass of each of these objects",
    ", we must assume that the same initial mass function prevails in both of these clusters , and combine @xmath6 with the half light radius determined from hst or other high spatial resolution imaging .",
    "@xcite have measured @xmath25 for m31  037b327 , while there are two independent and discrepant determinations of @xmath25 for g1 ( that of meylen _ et al . _",
    "2001 and of barmby , holland & huchra 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath25 for the highly reddened cluster m31  037b327 is not larger than that of g1 .",
    "thus there is no evidence that the highly reddened globular cluster m31  037b327 is substantially more massive than m31  g1 .",
    "the luminous object m31  037b327 believed to be a globular cluster in m31 is indeed a massive object which may or may not be the nucleus of an accreted galaxy , as was suggested by @xcite and others .",
    "however , although it is among the most massive globular clusters in m31 , at least four other globular clusters , g1 , g78 , g280 and g213 , studied by @xcite , whose earlier @xmath6 for g1 is confirmed here , have comparable masses .",
    "the first three of these are probably more massive than m31  037b327 . among the galactic globular clusters , @xmath26 cen and ngc",
    "6441 have @xmath6 comparable to that of m31  037b327 , based on the compilation of @xcite .",
    "contrary to the conclusion of @xcite , we find it to be very similar to the well studied cluster m31 g1 .",
    "m31  037b327 is not an extraordinarily massive old cluster , and is almost certainly not the most massive cluster of any age in the local group .",
    "the entire keck / hires user communities owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , steve vogt , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and hires a reality and to operate and maintain the keck observatory .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "the authors wish to extend special thanks to those of hawaiian ancestry on whose sacred mountain we are privileged to be guests . without their generous hospitality , none of the observations presented herein would have been possible .",
