    "the ligo interferometric gravitational wave ( gw ) detector held its first science run ( s1 ) in 2002 , from 23 august to 9 september @xcite .",
    "ligo consists of an interferometer ( ifo ) with 4  km arms in livingston , la , usa ( the ligo livingston observatory , or llo ) , called l1 for short , and two ifos , with arms of 4  km and 2  km , in hanford , wa , usa ( the ligo hanford observatory , or lho ) , called h1 and h2 , respectively .",
    "the data were analysed to search for gw bursts @xcite , signals from inspiralling neutron star binaries @xcite , periodic signals from a rotating neutron star @xcite , and stochastic backgrounds @xcite .",
    "this paper summarizes the analysis method and results of the search for a stochastic background of gravitational waves ( sbgw ) , which are explained in more detail in @xcite .",
    "a sbgw is assumed for simplicity to be isotropic , unpolarized , gaussian , and stationary .",
    "subject to these assumptions , the sbgw is completely described by its power spectrum .",
    "it is conventional to express this spectrum in terms of the gw contribution to the cosmological parameter @xmath1 : @xmath2 note that @xmath3 has been constructed to be dimensionless , and represents the contribution to the overall @xmath4 per _ logarithmic _ frequency interval . in particular , it is _ not _ equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "note also that since the critical density @xmath6 , which is used in the normalization of @xmath3 , is proportional to the square of the hubble constant @xmath7 @xcite , it is convenient to work with @xmath8 , which is independent of the observationally determined value of @xmath9 .",
    "is now much more accurately known than it once was , we still work in terms of @xmath8 to facilitate comparisons with prior results . ]",
    "the standard method to search for such a background is to cross - correlate the outputs of two gw detectors @xcite .",
    "if the noise in the two detectors is uncorrelated , the only non - zero contribution to the average cross - correlation ( cc ) will come from the sbgw . in the optimally - filtered cc method ( described in more detail in @xcite ) , one calculates a cc statistic @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the data streams from the two detectors , @xmath12 are their fourier transforms , and @xmath13 ( with fourier transform @xmath14 ) is a suitably - chosen optimal filter . the choice which optimizes signal - to - noise ratio for a constant-@xmath3 background is @xcite @xmath15 the normalization of the optimal filter is conventionally chosen so that in the presence of a sbgw of strength @xmath16 , the expected mean value of the cc statistic is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the duration of the analysed data sets .",
    "the expected variance of the cc statistic is @xmath19 ^ 2}{p_1(f)p_2(f ) }    \\right)^{-1 }    \\ .\\ ] ] the method is sensitive to backgrounds on the order of @xmath20 ^ 2}{f^6 { p_1(f ) p_2(f ) } }    \\right)^{-1/2 }    \\ .\\ ] ] the sensitivity of this method improves with time and is limited by the power spectral densities @xmath21 of the noise in the two detectors .",
    "the factor @xmath22 in the numerator of the integral is the _ overlap reduction function _",
    "@xcite , which describes the observing geometry . here",
    "@xmath23 is a projector onto symmetric traceless tensors transverse to a direction @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the _ detector response tensors _ for the two detectors .",
    "these are the tensors with which the metric perturbation @xmath26 at the detector should be contracted to obtain the _ gw strain _ @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are unit vectors pointing in the directions of an ifo s two arms , its response tensor is @xmath30    the overlap reduction function is equal to unity for the case of a pair of ifos at the same location with their arms aligned , and is suppressed as the detectors are rotated out of alignment or separated from one another .",
    "it also oscillates with frequency as correlations are suppressed for detectors whose separation is comparable to or greater than the corresponding gw wavelength .",
    "figure  [ fig : alloverlap ] shows the overlap reduction functions for combinations of detectors which were operational during s1 .     for combinations of the ligo livingston observatory ( llo ) and ligo hanford observatory ( lho ) with each other and with the geo600 site .",
    "( geo600 was also operational during s1 , but has not been included in this analysis because it was considerably less sensitive than the ligo detectors . )",
    "note that the overlap reduction function for correlations between the two detectors at lho ( h1 and h2 ) is identically equal to unity .",
    "the solid lines ( at @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) show the range of frequencies used in our analysis .",
    ", height=336 ]",
    "the previous best upper limit on a sbgw from direct observation with gw detectors was @xmath33 @xcite , set by correlating the resonant bar detectors explorer ( in geneva , switzerland ) and nautilus ( near rome , italy ) .",
    "a broad - band limit of @xmath34 was set using a pair of ` prototype ' ifos @xcite .",
    "more stringent upper limits can be set on astrophysical grounds .",
    "they are detailed elsewhere @xcite , but we mention the bound from big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , which states that a cosmological sbgw is limited by @xmath35 this broad - band limit implies that any cosmologically interesting sbgw very likely lies several orders of magnitude below the existing limits .",
    "each of the three combinations of detectors ( h1-l1 , h2-l1 , and h1-h2 ) was analysed separately for ccs .",
    "since the power spectra @xmath21 varied over the course of the s1 run , the concident data for each pair of ifos were divided into 15  min blocks , and an optimal filter constructed for each such block .. ] to maximize overall signal - to - noise ratio @xcite , we combined the cc statistics from the different blocks using a weighting factor of @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the theoretical standard deviation defined in ( [ eq : ccvar ] ) . note that this can be calculated from the individual power spectra , without cross - correlating the data . to avoid problems from noisy and presumably less gaussian data , we discarded the 15  min blocks with the highest @xmath37 values , corresponding to a 5% total contribution to @xmath38 .    for each block ,",
    "an optimal filter was constructed with a frequency resolution of @xmath39 according to the discrete frequency - domain analogue of ( [ eq : qdef ] ) .",
    "the range of frequencies included in the calculation of the cc statistic was chosen to be 40314hz for h1-l1 and h2-l1 , and 40300hz for h1-h2 .",
    "given the power spectra of the instruments and the expected spectrum of correlations associated with a constant @xmath3 , frequencies outside that range were not expected to improve the sensitivity appreciably .",
    "additionally , individual frequency bins associated with cross - correlated instrumental noise were omitted from the sum over frequencies ( which means the optimal filter was effectively set to zero there ) .",
    "these were integer multiples of 16hz and 60hz , as well as a few frequencies which had a coherence over the entire run above 0.2 , namely 250hz for l1-h2 , and 168.25hz and 168.5hz for h1-h2 .",
    "each 15  min block was divided into ten 90  s segments using a tukey window which consisted of half  s hann transitions on either side of an 89  s flat top .",
    "the cc statistic was calculated for each segment , using the discrete analogue of the frequency - domain form of ( [ eq : ccstat ] ) , and these were combined to give a cc statistic for the entire block . in this way",
    ", we were able to obtain , through the measured standard deviation of the ten cc statistics within a block , a statistical measure of the error associated with the cc statistic for the block .",
    "we also estimated the systematic error associated with the change in sensitivity and calibration over the course of each block .",
    "we then combined all three , appropriately weighted over the whole run , to obtain a total estimated error @xmath40 associated with the point estimate @xmath41 calculated from the weighted average of all the cc statistics using ( [ eq : ccmean ] ) . in the absence of cross - correlated noise , the 90% confidence level upper limit on @xmath42 , the constant value of @xmath3 , is @xmath43",
    "the results for the three ifo pairs are summarized in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    ".summary of the point estimate @xmath41 and total estimated error @xmath44 for the three ifo pairs considered .",
    "note that no upper limit is set from h1-h2 , the two ifos at the hanford site , since there was evidence of cross - correlated noise . associated with each of the values quoted is an additional 20% uncertainty arising from the calibration of the instruments . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there is a statistically significant anti - correlation observed between h1 and h2 , two ifos which share the same vacuum envelope at the lho site in hanford , wa .",
    "time - shift and @xmath45 analyses show that this anti - correlation is inconsistent with constant-@xmath46 sbgw , so we conclude it is due to instrumental cross - correlations between the two colocated detectors . for the inter - site measurements ( h1-l1 and h2-l1 ) , the lack of statistically significant cross - correlations makes these checks trivial , and we proceed to setting an upper limit from each pair .",
    "the stronger upper limit is set by h2 and l1 , and it is @xmath47 this represents a factor of 23 improvement over the previous direct upper limits described in sec .",
