    "coding has attracted significant attention in various research areas since it was first introduced by birk and kol @xcite . due to its relevance to various topics in information theory ,",
    "lots of research has been done on index coding even though it was first considered for the satellite communication systems .",

    "_ proved that the optimal codelength of linear index codes is equal to the parameter @xmath1 of the fitting matrix of the side information graph and suggested an optimal construction method for the linear index codes @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was proved that there is a nonlinear index code which outperforms the optimal linear index codes @xcite .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that every network coding problem can be converted to a corresponding index coding problem , and vice versa , for the given network structure .",
    "furthermore , there was a trial relating the topological interference management ( tim ) with index coding @xcite .",
    "most index coding problems assume that the sender knows the side information graph and each receiver has some subsets of messages as side information .",
    "recently , kao _",
    "et  al . _",
    "researched a case where the sender only knows the probability distribution of side information in the receivers @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "_ assumed that the sender knows the side information graph but a form of side information in each receiver is a linear combination of messages .",
    "while most of the index coding problems are studied in an error - free broadcast channel , there has been some work on the index codes with channel errors @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in particular , dau _",
    "_ introduced error correcting index codes ( ecic ) in the erroneous broadcast channel and algebraically analyzed them @xcite .",
    "there has also been research on capacity analysis and application of index codes with side information over the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as we can see from the previous works , index coding problems have been generalized further and become more realistic .    in this paper ,",
    "new index coding problems with erroneous side information are presented , where each receiver has erroneous side information . in the conventional index coding , it is assumed that every receiver can exploit its side information directly because there is no side information error .",
    "however , there is always a possibility of memory errors in the receivers , which causes side information errors .",
    "since there are some instances where side information is attained by sending messages through the broadcast channel , channel errors also cause erroneous side information .",
    "thus , we have to consider a possibility having erroneous side information in the index coding problem .",
    "there are several applications of index coding with erroneous side information such as tim .",
    "it is known that the interference channels of a receiver in tim correspond to the messages , which are not the side information of the receiver in index coding .",
    "if the interference channels vary due to the moving receivers or are misunderstood as the non - interference channels from the false channel state information in tim , this corresponds to index coding with erroneous side information .",
    "thus , index coding with erroneous side information can be applied for the effective solutions of tim .    in this paper , we propose the encoding and decoding procedures of index codes with side information errors ( icsie ) , where each receiver has erroneous side information symbols in the error - free broadcast channel .",
    "one of the most important parameters in index coding is the codelength .",
    "thus , the bounds on the optimal codelength of the proposed icsie are derived and its crucial graph , called a @xmath0-cycle , similar to the cycle in the conventional index coding is proposed .",
    "we relate the conventional index codes with the icsie by using the proposed bound and compare the cycle of the conventional index coding with the @xmath0-cycle of the proposed icsie .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that there is a similarity between the generator matrix of the icsie and the transpose of the parity check matrix of the error correcting code when the corresponding side information graph is a clique .",
    "finally , the ecic in @xcite is generalized by using the proposed icsie , which is called a generalized error correcting index code ( gecic ) . that is",
    ", we consider the more general scenario , where both channel errors and side information errors exist .",

    "<S> the encoding and decoding procedures of the icsie are proposed , based on the syndrome decoding . </S>",
    "<S> then , we derive the bounds on the optimal codelength of the proposed index code with erroneous side information . furthermore , we introduce a special graph for the proposed index coding problem , called a @xmath0-cycle whose properties are similar to those of the cycle in the conventional index coding problem </S>",
    "<S> . properties of the icsie are also discussed in the @xmath0-cycle and clique . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the proposed icsie is generalized to an index code for the scenario having both additive channel errors and side information errors , called a generalized error correcting index code ( gecic ) .    </S>",
