    "recently , energy harvesting or rechargeable sensor networks emerge as a new paradigm of sensor networks , in which the nodes can harvest energy from nature @xcite@xcite . before this",
    ", sensor network nodes are powered by batteries with limited energy storage , which are hard to recharge or replace .",
    "therefore , the key challenge is to save energy and prolong network lifetime while guaranteeing the application - specific performance .",
    "in contrast , the harvested energy relaxes the energy constraint thus extending network lifetime in energy harvesting sensor networks .",
    "however , the energy that can be harvested from the environment is unstable and varies over time .",
    "hence , the harvested energy should be carefully utilized in order to maximize the utility of energy harvesting sensor networks .",
    "a lot of excellent works on energy management in energy harvesting sensor networks have been done .",
    "for example , two - stage communication power management algorithms were proposed for maximizing the utility of energy harvesting sensors , considering the energy neutrality constraint , the fixed power loss effects of circuitry , and the battery inefficiency and its capacity @xcite .",
    "energy allocation over source acquisition / compression and transmission for a single energy harvesting sensor was addressed that guarantee minimum average distortion while ensuring stability of the queue connecting source and channel encoders @xcite .",
    "discounted cost markov decision process and reinforcement learning algorithms were applied to find optimal energy management policies to maximize the performance of a single energy harvesting sensor @xcite . through modeling the ambient energy supply by a two - state markov chain and assuming a finite battery capacity , low - complexity transmission policies were proposed for a wireless sensor powered by an energy harvesting device @xcite .",
    "conditions for balancing a node s expected energy consumption with its expected energy harvesting capability in a uniformly - formed wireless sensor network were derived @xcite .",
    "a stochastic markov chain framework was proposed to characterize the interplay between the battery discharge policy and the irreversible degradation of the storage capacity @xcite .",
    "in addition , other energy harvesting communication systems were also investigated @xcite@xcite .",
    "specifically , many energy harvesting communication schemes have been designed toward the goal of minimizing the transmission completion time .",
    "for example , optimal packet scheduling in a point - to - point communication system was studied in @xcite .",
    "the goal is to adjust the transmission rate according to the data arrival and harvested energy , such that the time by which all packets are delivered is minimized .",
    "transmission powers were optimized for a broadcasting communication system with an energy harvesting transmitter @xcite .",
    "the objective is to minimize the time by which all packets are sent to their destinations . in @xcite , this problem",
    "was further studied assuming a finite capacity battery . while @xcite , @xcite@xcite studied packet scheduling over the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , @xcite studied packet scheduling in a point - to - point communication system over fading channels . except for the above representative works ,",
    "the effects of multiple access channel , parallel and fading gaussian broadcast channels , interference channel , time varying channels , wireless energy transfer , and packet arrivals during transmission were also taken into account @xcite@xcite .",
    "the earlier works @xcite-@xcite mainly considered energy harvesting communication systems with only one transmitter .",
    "however , nowadays many communication systems are equipped with more than one transmitter .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to study energy harvesting communication systems with multiple transmitters . in @xcite , optimal packet scheduling in a multiple access communication system with two energy harvesting transmitters was investigated . in @xcite , a communication system with an energy harvesting transmitter over parallel and fading gaussian broadcast channels was studied . in @xcite , an optimal power allocation policy for a communication system with two energy harvesting transmitters over an interference channel",
    "was proposed .",
    "these works shed light on energy harvesting communication systems with multiple transmitters , but did not consider transmitter switching . in our opinion , transmitter switching can provide flexibility and robustness to an energy harvesting communication system , especially when a transmitter is unable to send data or the energy harvested from the environment is insufficient for data transmission . if this happens , other neighboring transmitters can turn to work and help the transmitter to proceed data transmission . to make the transmitter switching effective and decrease the switching overhead , a well - designed policy is essential to choosing the suitable transmitter to work .    motivated by the above fact and lying on the earlier works @xcite , power allocation and transmitter switching for broadcasting in a communication system with multiple energy harvesting transmitters and multiple receivers",
    "are studied in this paper .",
    "our target is to minimize the transmission completion time and to reduce the number of switches under the energy causality constraint .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows : 1 ) the optimal total transmission power and the optimal power allocation policy in @xcite are rebuilt in the communication system with multiple energy harvesting transmitters ; 2 ) a new power allocation policy is proposed which performs close to the optimal one but is simpler ; 3 ) a new transmitter switching policy is proposed for the communication system with multiple energy harvesting transmitters and multiple receivers , which is more complex than the communication systems we studied before @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , the energy harvesting communication system with multiple transmitters and multiple receivers",
    "is described . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "the power allocation and transmitter switching policies are elaborated .",
    "simulation results are presented in section [ sec4 ] and some concluding remarks are given in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "we consider an energy harvesting communication system with multiple transmitters and multiple receivers , as shown in figure  [ tu1 ] .",
    "there are @xmath0 energy harvesting transmitters @xmath1 and @xmath2 receivers @xmath3 .",
    "the energies arriving to the transmitters @xmath4 are stochastic ( both the arriving time and the amount are random ) and independent of each other , while the data @xmath5 are broadcasted by the transmitters in turn .",
    "here @xmath6 is the data to be sent to the receiver @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the energies arrive during the course of transmission while the data are given before transmission . for tractability , the arriving time and the amount of energies are assumed to be known at the beginning of transmission .",
    "this system looks like a multi - input multi - output one .",
    "but we view the transmitters as a ` whole transmitter ' @xcite and focus on transmitter switching that can enhance flexibility and robustness of the system .",
    "the transmitters cooperate to send the data @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , ",
    ", @xmath12 to the corresponding receivers .",
    "every time one of the transmitters @xmath13 will be active to broadcast data to the receivers .",
    "a transmitter switching policy will be designed to choose a suitable transmitter to work when the current working transmitter uses up its energy .",
    "the energy arriving process for the transmitter @xmath13 is depicted in figure  [ tu2 ] .",
    ".,width=288 ]    at the time @xmath14 , the amount of energy @xmath15 arrives to @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath16 is the initial energy available in the battery of @xmath13 before the transmission starts .",
    "it is assumed that the batteries of the transmitters have infinite capacity and the harvested energy will not overflow .",
    "since there is only one transmitter sending data every time , the channel shown in figure  [ tu1 ] is actually a broadcast channel .",
    "it is assumed that the chosen transmitter @xmath13 sends data to each receiver through an awgn channel with different path losses .",
    "the signal received by the receiver @xmath7 can be represented by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the path loss between @xmath13 and @xmath7 , @xmath19 is the transmitted signal , @xmath20 is an awgn with zero mean and variance @xmath21 .",
    "here @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the noise power spectral density in the channel between @xmath13 and @xmath7 , and @xmath24 is the bandwidth .",
    "it is assumed that all channels have the same bandwidth .",
    "then , the capacity region for the broadcast channel is @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the transmission rate when @xmath13 sends data to @xmath7 with power @xmath27 , @xmath27 is a portion of the total transmission power split to @xmath7 , @xmath28 is the total transmission power . in the following ,",
    "we analyze data transmission from the information - theoretic point of view . it is assumed that data transmission is always successful no matter which transmitter broadcasts data .",
    "moreover , the transmitters will not send data that has been sent out .",
    "this can be coordinated by a central controller .    to minimize the transmission completion time ( by which the given number of bits are delivered to their intended receivers )",
    ", power allocation should be executed among the data transmissions under the energy causality constraint .",
    "the energy causality means that at any given time , the total amount of consumed energy must be no more than the total amount of harvested energy .",
    "following our previous work in @xcite , we treat all the transmitters as a ` whole transmitter ' ( _ we only care about the amount of bits sent to the receivers while the bits sent by which transmitter do not matter _ ) and find out the optimal total transmission power that achieves the maximum departure region @xcite for a given deadline ( the dual problem of transmission completion time minimization ) . then , we rebuild the optimal power allocation policy @xcite in our system setup . as the optimal power allocation policy needs the total transmission powers in all time slots to calculate the cut - off powers , we propose a simpler power allocation policy which only requires the total transmission power in the current time slot .",
    "since every time only one transmitter is active to send data , transmitter switching is unavoidable .",
    "however , more switching among transmitters will bring greater control overhead , even though the energy consumed for transmitter switching is relatively small . to reduce control overhead and to save energy",
    ", the number of switches should be as least as possible .",
    "following our previous work in @xcite , we propose a transmitter switching policy to choose the suitable transmitter to send data with the principle of less number of switches .",
    "it should be emphasized that the turn of the working transmitters does not affect the transmission completion time .",
    "so we do power allocation first and then conduct transmitter switching .",
    "note that with the optimal total transmission power at hand , transmitter switching can also be done before power allocation .",
    "in this section , the power allocation policies and the transmitter switching policy will be presented .      with the aim of minimizing the transmission completion time ,",
    "the optimal total transmission power was obtained in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "an optimal power allocation policy was derived for a broadcast communication system with an energy harvesting transmitter . regarding the transmitters as a ` whole transmitter ' , we record the energy arriving to the transmitters in chronological order , as shown in figure  [ tu3 ] .",
    "here @xmath29 is the sum of the initial energy in the batteries .",
    "the ` whole transmitter ' harvests energy at the time instant @xmath30 with amount @xmath31 .",
    "this energy can be harvested by an arbitrary transmitter that we do not need to know .    with the new energy arriving process , the optimal total transmission power will be calculated and some properties of the optimal power allocation policy will be referenced in the following :    first , from * lemma 1 * we know that the total transmission power remains constant between two consecutive energy harvesting instants , that is , the total transmission power only changes at an energy harvesting time instant .    second , from * lemma 2",
    "* we get that the maximum departure region is a convex region .",
    "it means that there is one and only one optimal total transmission power .",
    "third , from * lemma 3 * we derive the expression of the total transmission power as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the transmission completion time and the energy arriving time before it is denoted as @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the optimal total transmission power for the ` whole transmitter ' @xmath36 over the interval @xmath37 , @xmath38 .    after calculating the optimal total transmission power ,",
    "we further split the power to the data transmissions . without loss of generality",
    ", we rank all of the variances from @xmath39 as @xmath40 and denote the receiver corresponding to @xmath41 as the @xmath42th receiver .",
    "therefore , the first receiver is the strongest and the @xmath2th receiver is the weakest @xcite . from * lemma 4 * , we know that there is a cut - off power for each of the strongest @xmath43 receivers , which are denoted as @xmath44 . if the optimal total transmission power is below @xmath45 , all the power is allocated to the strongest receiver and the power allocated to the remaining @xmath43 receivers are zero . if the optimal total transmission power is higher than @xmath45 , the power allocated to the first receiver is @xmath45 .",
    "then , we check whether the remaining power is below @xmath46 or not . if the remaining power is higher than @xmath46 , the power @xmath46 will be allocated to the second strongest receiver .",
    "otherwise , all the remaining power will be allocated to the second strongest receiver and power will not be allocated to the remaining @xmath47 receivers .",
    "the rest can be done in the same manner .    from * corollary 1 * of * lemma 4 * , we know that the power for the data transmission to every receiver is either a non - negative constant sequence or an increasing non - negative sequence .    from * lemma 5 * we know that with the optimal power allocation policy , all the data sent to the respective receivers must be finished at the same time .    with these properties and based on the results in @xcite , the optimal total transmission powers and the cut - off powers are obtained , which are plotted in figure  [ tu4 ] .          aiming at minimizing the transmission completion time , we propose an alternative power allocation policy that performs close to the optimal one but is simpler .",
    "the idea is that we heuristically make the transmission rates be proportional .",
    "this satisfies the properties mentioned in the previous subsection . to illustrate the proposed power allocation policy",
    ", we partition the total transmission time into several time slots according to figure  [ tu4 ] . in every time slot , there is no transmitter switching and the transmission rate keeps constant .",
    "next we derive the relationship between the amount of bits that to be transmitted and the transmission rates in all time slots .",
    "take the data @xmath48 which corresponds to @xmath49 as an example .",
    "the partitioning of time slots and the corresponding transmission rates are shown in figure  [ tupr ] .",
    ".,width=288 ]    in the first time slot @xmath50 , the transmission rate for @xmath48 is @xmath51 .",
    "the rate during the next time slot is @xmath52 , the transmission completion time is @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the number of the time slots , and @xmath54 is equal to or greater than the number of switches ( when the current working transmitter has energy left at the time the optimal total transmission power changes ) .",
    "the following equation can be easily obtained : @xmath55 for notational simplicity , we continue the derivation at the system with three receivers , which are @xmath56 .",
    "the derivation holds in the case of more receivers .",
    "the data to be delivered to the receivers are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the power allocated to @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . during every time slot ,",
    "@xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are constant .",
    "the relationship between the total transmission power and @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 from ( [ gspr3 ] ) , we get the following equations : @xmath63 we set @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants ) . by substituting them in the first equation of ( [ gspr5 ] )",
    ", we can get that @xmath68 then , we obtain the relationship @xmath69 substituting ( [ gs2 ] ) into ( [ gspr7 ] ) and combining ( [ gspr4 ] ) , the power allocation @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 in every time slot can be obtained .      in this subsection , a transmitter switching policy for choosing the suitable transmitter to work will be presented . with the optimal total transmission power and the allocated powers at hand , the transmission completion time can be determined . for a given transmission completion time @xmath53 ,",
    "the following propositions are introduced .",
    "* proposition 1 : * the transmitter which harvests energy at its last energy harvesting time before the transmission completion time will turn to work as long as the working transmitter uses up its energy .",
    "proof : the transmitter which harvests energy at its last energy harvesting time before the transmission completion time is named as _ full transmitter _",
    "( which has finished energy harvesting ) and the other transmitters are called _ partial transmitters_. we assume that the current working transmitter is @xmath70 and it sends data with power @xmath35 ( as transmitter switching is not affected by power allocation )",
    ". moreover , the optimal total transmission power keeps constant over several switches ( if there is only one switch during the time the optimal total transmission power keeps constant , the following analysis still holds ) .",
    "the full transmitter @xmath71 harvests the last energy at the time instant @xmath72 with amount @xmath73 , as shown in figure  [ tu5 ] .",
    "the total amount of energy available for @xmath71 is denoted by @xmath74 ( energies harvested by @xmath71 at earlier energy harvesting time may not be used up ) .",
    "the next switching instant is denoted by @xmath75 . for clarity",
    ", we still take the system with three transmitters as an example .",
    "the analysis can be easily extended to the system with more transmitters .",
    "the partial transmitter is denoted by @xmath76 with the amount of energy @xmath77 at the time instant @xmath75 .",
    "there are two possible cases which transmitter should work first between @xmath71 and @xmath76 .    in case 1 , we assume that the partial transmitter @xmath76 works first .",
    "the amount of energy harvested by @xmath76 during the interval @xmath78 is denoted by @xmath79 , and @xmath80 . at the time instant @xmath81 , @xmath71 turns to work .",
    "the length of the working time slot for @xmath71 is @xmath82 . at the time instant @xmath83",
    ", another transmitter turns to work .    in case 2",
    ", we assume that the full transmitter @xmath71 works first . at the time instant @xmath84",
    ", @xmath76 turns to work . during the interval @xmath85 , the amount of energy harvested by @xmath76 is @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath88 . at the time",
    "instant @xmath89 , another transmitter turns to work .",
    "the length of the working time slots with twice switches in case 2 must be longer than or equal to the one in case 1 .",
    "for a given transmission completion time @xmath53 , the longer working time slot per switch will bring less number of switches .",
    "hence the full transmitter should work first .",
    "* proposition 2 : * if there is more than one full transmitter , the working order of the full transmitters does not affect the number of switches .",
    "proof : when there are more than one full transmitter , we let all of them working earlier than the partial transmitters based on * proposition 1*. this prolongs the energy harvesting time for the partial transmitters before they use up their energies . as there is no energy arriving to the full transmitters , which full transmitter turns to work first has no influence on the working time slots for the remaining full transmitters .",
    "so the working order of the full transmitters has no effect on the partial transmitters , also does not affect the number of switches .",
    "* proposition 3 : * when no full transmitter exists in the system , the transmitter with the maximum amount of energy available should work first .",
    "proof : greater amount of energy brings longer working time with the same transmission power . for a given transmission completion time @xmath53 , longer working time leads to less number of switches .    with the above propositions ,",
    "the suitable transmitter can be found .",
    "to help understanding the use of harvested energy , we take a partial transmitter @xmath90 as an example , as shown in figure  [ tu6 ] .",
    ".,width=288 ]    the use of harvested energy for other transmitters are similar to @xmath90 . in figure",
    "[ tu6 ] , @xmath91 is the amount of energy available in the battery of @xmath90 at the present time @xmath92 . at the time instant @xmath93 ,",
    "@xmath90 harvests energy with amount @xmath94 . with the transmission power @xmath35 ,",
    "the amount of energy @xmath91 can make the transmitter work for a time slot @xmath95 , where @xmath96 . during this time slot ,",
    "if there is new energy arriving , it will be harvested by @xmath90 and put into use before switching .",
    "for example , two energies @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be harvested before switching .",
    "then , the new harvested energy @xmath99 will be used to send data for a new time slot @xmath100 . until the time instant @xmath101 ,",
    "if there is new energy arriving , it will be harvested and used for keeping @xmath90 work ; otherwise , if there is no new energy arriving , at the time instant @xmath101 another transmitter will turn to work .",
    "numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the power allocation policies and the transmitter switching policy .",
    "first , the proposed power allocation policy is compared with the optimal power allocation policy .",
    "then , the proposed power allocation policy is compared with some heuristic power allocation policies .",
    "finally , the proposed transmitter switching policy is compared with some heuristic transmitter switching policies .",
    "we take the energy harvesting communication system with @xmath102 and @xmath103 as an example .",
    "the length between two consecutive energy arriving time for @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 obeys exponential distribution with parameters @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "the amount of harvested energy @xmath15 ( mj ) obeys uniform distribution in the interval ( 0 , 0.01 ) , ( 0 , 0.02 ) and ( 0 , 0.03 ) , respectively .",
    "note that there is no actual model of the distributions of the stochastic energy arriving time and amount of arrived energy yet .",
    "we adopt these distributions just for exposition purpose .",
    "the analysis in the previous section does not depend on the distributions .",
    "the bits to be sent to @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath58 are @xmath9=70 bit , @xmath10=20 bit and @xmath11=10 bit , respectively .",
    "the three transmitters have the same channel parameters as follows : the bandwidth @xmath112=1 mhz ; the path loss between @xmath13 and @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath58 are @xmath113=100 db , @xmath114=101 db , @xmath115=102 db , respectively , @xmath116 ; the noise power spectral density is @xmath117 w / hz , @xmath116 , @xmath118 .",
    "the transmission rates can be written as follows : @xmath119    according to the above simulation parameters , we can get the optimal total transmission powers of the ` whole transmitter ' as @xmath120=0.4712 mw , @xmath121=0.5910 mw , @xmath122=0.6139 mw , @xmath123=0.6593 mw and @xmath124=0.7263 mw .",

    "we plot the allocated powers in the upper panel of figure  [ tudb ] . with the proposed power allocation policy ,",
    "the power @xmath130 remain constant during a time slot and increase at the time instants @xmath131 .",
    "we also plot the allocated powers under the optimal power allocation policy in the lower panel of figure  [ tudb ] .",
    "the transmission completion time of the optimal power allocation policy is 10.788513518 s. the power allocated to @xmath110 is a constant @xmath45=0.0888 w , the power allocated to @xmath111 is also a constant @xmath46=0.2354 w , and the remaining power @xmath132 is allocated to @xmath58 . because the optimal total transmission power is a constant or an increasing sequence , @xmath133 changes simultaneously with @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . even though the transmission completion time under the proposed power allocation policy is @xmath134 s longer than the one under the optimal power allocation policy , the relative deviation is 0.04% , which can be neglected .",

    "it is observed that the increase of number of bits may not enlarge the relative deviation , though it prolongs the transmission completion time .",
    "moreover , the relative deviations are small for a moderate amount of bits .      to show the advantage of the proposed power allocation policy , we compare it with some heuristic power allocation policies as follows",

    "<S> with the advancement of battery technology , energy harvesting communication systems attracted great research attention in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> however , energy harvesting communication systems with multiple transmitters and multiple receivers have not been considered yet . in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> the problem of broadcasting in a communication system with multiple energy harvesting transmitters and multiple receivers is studied . </S>",
    "<S> first , regarding the transmitters as a ` whole transmitter ' @xcite , the optimal total transmission power is obtained and the optimal power allocation policy in @xcite is extended to our system setup , with the aim of minimizing the transmission completion time . </S>",
    "<S> then , a simpler power allocation policy is developed to allocate the optimal total transmission power to the data transmissions . </S>",
    "<S> as transmitter switching can provide flexibility and robustness to an energy harvesting communication system , especially when a transmitter is broken or the energy harvested by a transmitter is insufficient , a transmitter switching policy is further developed to choose a suitable transmitter to work whenever necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the proposed power allocation policy performs close to the optimal one and outperforms some heuristic ones in terms of transmission completion time . </S>",
    "<S> besides , the proposed transmitter switching policy outperforms some heuristic ones in terms of number of switches .    </S>",
