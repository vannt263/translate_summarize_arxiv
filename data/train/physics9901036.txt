    "the study of dielectric properties of polar liquids by computer experiment is still a major challenge , given that the dielectric quantities are very sensitive to long - range intermolecular interactions and because long trajectories are required in order to obtain adequate statistical accuracy .",
    "for this reason , until now , the calculation of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity , @xmath0 , in the whole region of @xmath1 and @xmath2 has been performed for the simplest model of polar systems only , namely , for the stockmayer fluid [ 1 ] .",
    "this model is related to a class of molecular models describing interactions by point dipoles embedded in molecules .",
    "the stockmayer system , however , does not reproduce satisfactorily the dielectric behaviour of any real polar fluid .    at the same time , more realistic interaction site ( is ) models have also been considered [ 216 ] . in these atomic models ,",
    "intermolecular potentials are presented as a sum of pairwise additive site - site terms .",
    "although is models do not take into account internal degrees of freedom such as electronic polarizability and , as a rule , intramolecular vibrations , they are able to reproduce experimental results in a more satisfactory way .",
    "there are two approaches to investigate the dielectric properties of is models in both computer experiment and theory . in the first , point dipole ( pd ) approach ,",
    "the charged sites of each molecule are replaced by a point dipole , located in the molecular centre of mass , at constructing the reaction field and the microscopic polarization vector .",
    "the site - site contributions are taken into account implicitly only , namely , in the intermolecular potentials , calculating statistical averages . in the second ,",
    "is description , the reaction and the polarization vector are constructed in view of explicit details of charge distribution within the molecule [ 1618 ] .",
    "main attention in early studies was directed to evaluate the static and frequency - dependent dielectric constant , @xmath3 , in the long - wavelength limit . in particular , such quantities",
    "have been calculated in molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations for the rigid mcy [ 5 ] and tip4p [ 6 ] models of water as well as for the flexible spc potential [ 7 ] .",
    "the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity at nonzero wavevectors was investigated for the mcy [ 2 ] and tip4p [ 9 , 10 ] water models , for models of methyl cyanide [ 3 , 4 ] , methanol [ 11 ] and methanol - water mixtures [ 13 ] .",
    "but the investigations have been restricted to small wavevector values for which the pd approach and the is description are expected to be identical .",
    "the wavevector dependence , @xmath4 , including high wavevector values , was considered in the static limit for methanol [ 8 ] , methanol - water mixtures [ 12 ] and for the mcy water [ 14 ] , using , however , the pd approximation . and",
    "only quite a few simulations [ 15 , 16 ] have been performed to define the entire wavevector dependence within the exact is description . to our knowledge",
    ", there are no computer experiment data concerning the entire frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity of is models at arbitrary wavenumbers .",
    "it is necessary to point out also the following aspect of computer simulation of is models .",
    "the calculation of the dielectric constant by md requires explicit considerations of a finite - size medium with periodic boundaries .",
    "usually either the cumbersome ewald summation technique [ 19 ] or the reaction field [ 20 ] is applied for treating long ranged interactions .",
    "as is now well established for systems of point dipoles , proper calculations can be made with the both methods [ 21 ] . in the case of is models the pattern is different .",
    "the usual point dipole reaction field ( pdrf ) geometry , being exact for macroscopic systems of point dipoles , may not be necessarily applicably to interpret simulation results of is models [ 22 ] . recently",
    "[ 16 ] , it has been shown by actual calculations that uncertainties of the dielectric quantities are significant if the standard pdrf geometry is used in computer simulations . as a result , an alternative approach has been proposed .",
    "this approach deals with the is description at constructing the reaction field and leads to the so - called interaction site reaction field ( isrf ) geometry .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the isrf geometry exhibits to be much more efficient with respect to the usual pdrf for the investigation of dielectric properties of is models . within the isrf geometry , the longitudinal component , @xmath5 , of the wavevector - dependent dielectric constant for",
    "the mcy water model has been evaluated in a wide wavenumber range by monte carlo simulations [ 16 ] .",
    "using correct microscopic variables for the polarization vector allows one to achieve the true infinite wavevector behaviour @xmath6 .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a self - consistent theory for the calculation of the longitudinal wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant , @xmath7 , for is models in computer experiment .",
    "this theory is applied to the tip4p potential using md simulations .",
    "we show that the pd approach is valid for describing the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant at very small wavenumbers only . for greater wavenumber values",
    ", the influence of higher order multipoles becomes important . within the is description",
    ", the longitudinal permittivity is evaluated in a rather very large scale of wavenumbers and frequencies up to the infinite wavevector and frequency limit , where @xmath8 .",
    "we consider a polar system with @xmath9 identical molecules composed of @xmath10 interaction sites which are enclosed in a volume @xmath11 .",
    "the microscopic field , created by the molecules at point @xmath12 and time @xmath13 for a macroscopic system is equal to  @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the charge and position of site @xmath17 within the molecule @xmath18 , and the sum extends over all molecules and charged sites .",
    "this sum , however , can not be calculated exactly in computer experiment which deals with finite samples .",
    "therefore , we must restrict ourselves to a finite set of the terms for which @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a cut - off radius . the radius @xmath20 does not exceed half the cell length @xmath21{v}$ ] if a cubic sample and the toroidal boundary conventional ( tbc ) are used in simulations .",
    "now the following problem appears . how to estimate the cut - off field caused by the summation over the unaccessible region @xmath22 ?",
    "a solution of this problem can be found within the isrf geometry [ 16 ] .",
    "the result for conducting boundary conditions is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the heviside function , i.e. , @xmath25 if @xmath26 and @xmath27 otherwise . the first term in the right - hand side of ( 1 ) describes the usual coulomb field , while the second contribution corresponds to the reaction field in the is description . performing the spatial fourier transform of ( 1 ) one obtains @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the longitudinal component for the microscopic operator of polarization density for is models [ 18 ] and @xmath30 denotes the spherical bessel function of first order .",
    "it is worth mentioning that as far as relativistic effects are excluded from our consideration , the electric field ( 1 ) does not take into account retardation corrections .",
    "for the same reason , we have neglected also the contribution to the field caused by dynamical magnetic fields of moving charges .",
    "because of this , the electric field has a static form and depends on time implicitly only .",
    "this field is pure longitudinal and can be defined uniquely via the longitudinal component of the polarization vector @xmath31 , that is confirmed by equation ( 2 ) .",
    "let us apply an external electric field @xmath32 to the system under consideration , so that the total field is @xmath33 .",
    "the longitudinal , wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant is defined via the material relation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are longitudinal components of the macroscopic polarization and total field , @xmath37 denotes the statistical averaging at the presence of the external field , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the time fourier transform @xmath40 has been used for the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the perturbation theory of first order with respect to @xmath43 yields @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the equilibrium average at the absence of the external field , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the boltzmann s constant and the temperature of the system , respectively .",
    "then , eliminating @xmath48 from the presented above expressions , we obtain the desired fluctuation formula @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the longitudinal component of the wavevector - dependent dynamical kirkwood factor for the finite sample , @xmath51 denotes the permanent magnitude of molecule s dipole moment , @xmath52 designates the laplace transform , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in the case",
    "@xmath55 , when @xmath56 , the computer adapted formula ( 4 ) reduces to the fluctuation formula for macroscopic systems in terms of the infinite - system kirkwood factor @xmath57 .",
    "it is essential to emphasize that the fluctuation formula ( 4 ) takes into account finiteness of the system explicitly by the factor @xmath58 . as a consequence , for sufficiently large systems , the bulk ( @xmath59 ) dielectric",
    "constant can be reproduced via the finite - system kirkwood factor @xmath60 calculated in simulations . however , in order to achieve this self - consistency in the evaluation of the bulk dielectric constant , the equilibrium averaging in @xmath60 must be performed for systems with the intermolecular potential which leads exactly to the microscopic electric field @xmath61 ( 1 ) at which the fluctuation formula has been derived .",
    "this intermolecular potential can be determined via the relation @xmath62 ) , whence @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 is , in general , an arbitrary constant which for infinite systems is chosen as @xmath67 . in our case , according to the toroidal boundary conventional , @xmath68 and , therefore , @xmath69 .",
    "then the intermolecular potential of interaction is @xmath70 , i.e , @xmath71 where the site - site cut - off @xmath72 is performed .",
    "the fluctuation formula ( 4 ) has already been applied previously in the long - wavelength limit at the investigation of the static and frequency - dependent dielectric constant for the mcy [ 5 ] and tip4p [ 6 ] models . however , acting within a semiphenomenological framework , it was not understood how to perform the truncation for intermolecular potentials . as a result ,",
    "the molecular cut - off @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the centre of mass of the @xmath18th molecule , and the usual pdrf have been suggested : @xmath75 it is easy to show that the self - consistent potential ( 6 ) can be reduced to ( 7 ) in one case only , namely , when @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , the pdrf potential ( 7 ) may affect on a true macroscopic behaviour of the system considerably . at the same time , the intermolecular potential @xmath78 corresponds completely to the conditions at which the fluctuation formula ( 4 ) has been obtained .",
    "therefore , as far as this formula is applied to treat simulation results , the isrf potential ( 6 ) , instead of ( 7 ) , must be used in computer experiment to reproduce a correct value for the dielectric constant .",
    "nevertheless , the molecular cut - off scheme can also be acceptable , but the pdrf potential ( 7 ) as well as the fluctuation formula ( 4 ) need to be modified .",
    "in fact , the intermolecular potential @xmath79 takes into account dipole contributions only into the reaction field .",
    "additional terms can be identified within the molecular reaction field ( mrf ) approach .",
    "the result is [ 16 ] : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the quadrupole moment of the @xmath18th molecule with respect to its centre of mass , @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the unit tensor , @xmath84 , and multipoles of higher orders have been neglected . the fluctuation formula corresponding to the potential ( 8) can be derived as follows .",
    "the microscopic electric field created by the molecules at point @xmath85 , coinciding with the centre of the spherical cavity of radius @xmath20 , surrounded by the infinity conduction medium , can be presented in the mrf geometry as @xmath86 ( quadrupole and higher - order moments do not contribute the field in the centre of the cavity ) . performing the spatial fourier transform of ( 9 ) yields after some algebra @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 are one of the allowed wavevectors @xmath90 of the reciprocal lattice , @xmath91 designates a vector with integer components and @xmath92{v}$ ] . as we can see @xmath93 , while @xmath94 is the microscopic operator of polarization density for a point dipole system .",
    "its longitudinal component @xmath95 coincides with @xmath41 in the point dipole limit : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , provided @xmath98 const . using the internal field ( 10 ) and applying the perturbation theory with respect to the external field , similar to that as in the case of the isrf geometry ,",
    "we obtain the following fluctuation formula @xmath99 where the summation is extended over the infinite set @xmath100 of nonzero wavevectors @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 are time correlation functions and @xmath104 .",
    "as was mentioned earlier , internal electric fields of classical systems are pure longitudinal . however , as it follows from the structure of equations ( 11 ) , the field @xmath105 ( 10 ) for finite systems may contain a transverse component as well which vanishes in the limit @xmath55 of infinite systems only . at the same time , in the isrf geometry the field @xmath105 ( 2 ) remains by a longitudinal one even for finite systems .",
    "therefore , from a physical point of view , the isrf geometry is more natural than the mrf approach , because it does not influence on the true structure of electric fields .",
    "moreover , within the mrf geometry , the fluctuation formula ( 12 ) appears to be very complicated with respect to the much more simple formula ( 4 ) in the isrf approach .",
    "it requires the knowledge of the additional correlation functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "while the function @xmath106 can be evaluated in the usual way , the function @xmath107 at fixed @xmath13 , even for spatially homogeneous systems , depends upon three parameters ( magnitudes of @xmath108 , @xmath101 and the cosine between them ) and its calculation is a hard problem and impractical in simulations .",
    "finally , the site - site cut - off truncation ( 6 ) has yet a minor advantage over the molecular cut - off scheme ( 8) because the intermolecular potential of interaction @xmath109 is continuous and continuously differentiable .",
    "this avoids the system energy drift associated with the passage of sites through the surface of the truncation sphere .",
    "md simulations have been carried out for the tip4p potential [ 23 ] in the microcanonical ensemble at a density of 1 g/@xmath110 and at a temperature of @xmath111 k using the isrf geometry ( 6 ) .",
    "we considered @xmath112 molecules in the cubic volume @xmath113 to which the toroidal boundary conditions have been applied .",
    "the interaction cut - off radius was half the cell length , @xmath114 .",
    "the simulations were started from a well equilibrated configuration for the positions of sites , obtained by monte carlo simulations .",
    "initial velocities of the molecules were generated at random with the maxwell distribution .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated with a time step @xmath115 fs on the basis of a matrix method using the verlet algorithm in velocity form .",
    "the system was allowed to achieve equilibrium for 100 000 time steps .",
    "the observation time over the equilibrium state was 1 000 000 @xmath115 ns and each 10th time step has been considered to compute the equilibrium averages . in order to provide the exact conservation for the total energy of the system during such a rather very long observation time , the velocities of atoms were slightly rescaled after every 500 time steps , so that the relative total energy fluctuations did not exceed 0.01% over the whole run .",
    "the time correlation functions were calculated with the time step @xmath116 in the interval of @xmath117 ps .",
    "the wavevector - dependent quantities were investigated for @xmath118 k_{\\rm min}$ ] , where @xmath119 .",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath120 of the wavevector - dependent kirkwood factor ( 5 ) at @xmath121 , obtained in the simulations within the is description , and the corresponding function @xmath122 ( 4 ) , related to the infinite system , are shown in fig .  1 by dashed and solid curves , respectively . in the pd approximation",
    "the diameter @xmath123 of the molecule is assumed to be sufficiently small in order to be entitled to replace the true microscopic operator @xmath41 ( 3 ) of polarization density for an is system by its analogue @xmath124 for a system of point dipoles .",
    "the infinite - system kirkwood factor calculated within the pd approximation , @xmath125 , is presented in fig .  1 by open squares .",
    "for the tip4p molecule @xmath126  and , therefore , the pd approximation can not be used for calculating the wavevector - dependent dielectric quantities at @xmath127 . indeed ,",
    "as we can see from the figure , the pd approach reproduces values for the kirkwood factor satisfactorily in a small region of wavenumbers only , namely , at @xmath128 . at greater wavevectors , these values differ considerably from those obtained within the is description . in the infinite wavevector regime ( @xmath129 )",
    "the kirkwood factor tends to @xmath130 , when the pd approximation is used , whereas it approaches zero with the asymptotic behaviour @xmath131 within the is description ( see appendix , equation ( a4 ) ) .",
    "the function @xmath131 is plotted in fig .  1 by the long - short dashed curve .    in order to verify explicitly that the isrf geometry reproduces adequately the wavevector dependence of dielectric quantities ,",
    "we have performed also additional simulations for calculations of @xmath132 using the generally recognized ewald geometry and the pdrf potential ( 7 ) .",
    "these results are included in fig .  1 as well ( the open circles and dotted curve ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 were used in the ewald summation of coulomb forces .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the isrf method leads to results which are identical to those obtained within the cumbersome ewald technique .",
    "at the same time , deviations of values for the wavevector - dependent kirkwood factor obtained using the pdrf potential from those evaluated within the isrf geometry are of order @xmath135 .",
    "they are well exhibited at intermediate values of wavevectors .",
    "such a situation can be explained by the fact that the pdrf geometry does not take into account the spatial distribution of charges within the molecule at constructing the reaction field and , thus , the precision of the calculations for wavevector - dependent dielectric quantities at @xmath136 can not exceed @xmath137 . and only for great wavevector values @xmath138 , where the influence of boundary conditions is negligible ,",
    "the both geometries become equivalent between themselves and the analytical formula ( a4 ) can be applied here .    to analyze the wavevector - dependent dielectric function in the low frequency limit , @xmath139 , it is more convenient to rewrite the fluctuation formula ( 4 ) in terms of the infinite - system kirkwood factor as follows @xmath140 where the equality @xmath141 has been used .",
    "in particular , the static wavevector - dependent dielectric function @xmath142 is obtained from the relation ( 13 ) putting @xmath143 .",
    "this function , calculated within the is description and the pd approximation , is displayed in fig .",
    "2a as circles connected by the solid curve and as open squares , respectively .",
    "as has been pointed out previously [ 6 ] , the static dielectric constant of the tip4p water at infinite wavelengths ( @xmath144 ) appears to be smaller than the experimental value @xmath145 for real water and consists about 53 .",
    "this value has been determined on the basis of md simulations using the pdrf geometry . in our calculations within the exact isrf geometry we have found that @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , the tip4p water reproduces the static dielectric constant of real water even somewhat worse than this has been established earlier .",
    "the function @xmath5 in the pd approximation behaves like that for the stockmayer fluid [ 21 , 24 ] .",
    "for example , in the infinite wavevector limit , the dielectric constant tends to the wrong onsager limit value @xmath147 .",
    "the true wavevector behaviour for the dielectric constant can be reproduced within the is description only .",
    "as we can see , the static dielectric constant of the tip4p water is negative over a wavevector range bounded by two singularities , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the first singularity is achieved at @xmath150 , whereas the second singularity may be estimated [ 14 ] via the relation @xmath151 this relation is derived solving the equation @xmath152 and neglecting intersite contributions ( the second term in the right - hand side of ( a4 ) ) in the intramolecular part @xmath153 of the kirkwood factor .",
    "applying the relation ( 14 ) yields for the tip4p molecule @xmath154 , that is in an excellent accord with the simulation result @xmath155 . at @xmath156",
    "the function @xmath5 , remaining positive , slightly approaches unity at @xmath157 . in the low frequency limit at @xmath158 we put @xmath159 and obtain from ( 13 ) that the dielectric constant behaves as @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the correlation time",
    "therefore , the real part of the dielectric permittivity in this regime is equal to zero , whereas the imaginary part tends to infinity as @xmath162 .",
    "this result can be better understood introducing the generalized coefficient @xmath163 of polarization conductivity , which defines the macroscopic current @xmath164 in the frequency representation as @xmath165 .",
    "taking into account that in this representation @xmath166 , we can express the polarization conductivity in terms of the dielectric constant as @xmath167 .",
    "thus in the limit of small frequencies we have that @xmath168 if @xmath169 and @xmath170 otherwise .    in view of the existence of a nonvanishing coefficient for the generalized conductivity in the static limit , the following question arises .",
    "does it violate the well - known law that static macroscopic currents are absent in the dielectrics ?",
    "we can be sure that this law remains in force , because @xmath171 when @xmath172 and , therefore , the total electric field in the system vanishes because of @xmath173 , so that the polarization current does not appear . in this case , the longitudinal external field is compensated completely by the internal field of polar molecules .",
    "moreover , the singularities in the dielectric permittivity do not lead to singularities in physically observing quantities .",
    "this is so because these quantities are expressed through the external electric field using multipliers of type @xmath174 or @xmath175 which are free of singularities . for instance",
    "the ratio @xmath176 of the macroscopic static field of polar molecules and the external field is determined by the factor @xmath177 .",
    "the sign minus shows that the field of molecules is opposite to the external field , because molecular dipole moments align always along external fields .",
    "the maximum magnitude of this factor ranges up to about 44.9 at @xmath178 ( the first maximum of the kirkwood factor ) , where the dielectric constant takes its almost maximum value @xmath179 within the negative region .",
    "the value @xmath180 corresponds to the wavelength @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , optimal conditions ( maximal average torques acting on molecules due to electric fields ) for alignment of dipoles along external fields are observed when spatial inhomogeneity of these fields has a characteristic length of its varying in coordinate space of order of the molecular diameter ( the so called spatial resonance ) .",
    "a similar wavevector behaviour of @xmath182 is exhibited for a central force model of water [ 15 ] .",
    "the knowledge of the dielectric constant in the whole region of wavenumbers allows one to solve the problem of static screening of external charges in water .",
    "an external charge , enclosed in the dielectric , causes a polarization of the system .",
    "the potential of the electric field , created in such a way , can be written in the @xmath108-representation as @xmath183 , where @xmath184 is the fourier transform for the potential @xmath185 of an unit charge in the vacuum .",
    "then applying the inverse fourier transform to the function @xmath186 one obtains @xmath187 .",
    "the function @xmath188 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "2b , describes the static screening .",
    "it can be shown easily , using the asymptotic behaviour ( a4 ) , that the dielectric constant in the infinite wavenumber regime is expanded over inverse wavevectors as @xmath189 , where @xmath190 .",
    "the expression @xmath191 is often used in the whole range of wavevectors , considering processes of static screening in plasma .",
    "this leads to the well - known debye exponential screening @xmath192 with the debye s radius @xmath193 . in the case of dielectrics",
    "the pattern is different .",
    "the function @xmath188 , starting from 1 at @xmath194 , exhibits a pronounced oscillatory feature , reflecting the influence of the microscopic structure of the system .",
    "and only beginning from distances to the external charge of order @xmath195 this function tends to its value @xmath196 in the macroscopic limit .",
    "examples for the normalized autocorrelation functions @xmath197 ( 5 ) and @xmath198 ( 4 ) , describing the time decay of longitudinal polarization fluctuations in the finite ( @xmath112 ) and infinite systems are plotted in fig .  3 by the circles and solid curves , respectively ( the infinite - system functions are obtained applying the inverse laplace transform to the relation ( 4 ) ) .",
    "the curves are for a set of wavevectors accessible in the simulations . for the purpose of comparison , analogous functions , @xmath199 , obtained within the pd approximation for the finite system ,",
    "are also presented in this figure by dashed curves . the self ( @xmath200 in equation ( a1 ) ) part @xmath201 of @xmath202 and the normalized function @xmath203 ( note that @xmath204 in the static limit ) corresponding to a noninteracting system , calculated with the help of stochastic simulations according to equation ( a2 ) , are included in fig .  3 as well and shown by the dotted and long - short dashed curves , respectively .",
    "as we can see , the self portion of @xmath205 begins to dominate already at @xmath206 and the free motion regime starts at @xmath207 .",
    "the normalized function @xmath208 , evaluated via the analytical formula ( a3 ) , is plotted in insets ( e)-(h ) of fig .  3 by open circles .",
    "the time correlation functions obtained in the is description are identical to those within the pd approximation in the zero wavevector limit only but they differ from one another significantly at greater ( @xmath209 ) wavevector values . for example , in the infinite wavevector limit ( see fig .",
    "3g , h ) , the pd functions exhibit the pure gaussian behaviour @xmath210 , whereas the is functions have a more complicated structure of the time dependence ( a3 ) .",
    "taking into account the remarks concerning the behaviour of these functions in the static limit ( see fig .  1 ) , we conclude that the pd approximation , being exact for systems of point dipoles , is unsuitable , in general , to investigate the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant of is models of polar fluids .",
    "the most striking feature in the time behaviour for the longitudinal component of the infinite - system function @xmath202 is damped oscillations superimposed on the exponential .",
    "they are called librational oscillations and can be observed for the self part @xmath211 as well . to show these oscillations in more detail ,",
    "we have also presented 3d plot of the function @xmath202 in fig .",
    "the librational oscillations appear for systems with a slowly relaxing character of intermolecular torques and describe the rapid motion of a molecule in the average electric field @xmath212 of its neighbours ( see fig .",
    "it is not a surprise , the librations are absent in the shape of the free - motion functions @xmath213 which can be related to polarization fluctuations of a dilute polar fluid .",
    "the librational oscillations have been found previously for the mcy [ 2 , 5 ] and tip4p potentials [ 6 ] and for a model of methyl cyanide [ 3 ] .",
    "however , the investigation of the librational oscillations was restricted to zero and very small values ( @xmath214 ) of wavevector . in our study ,",
    "performed in a rather very large scale of wavenumbers , we have identified the librational oscillations at small and intermediate wavenumber values , namely , at @xmath215 ( see figs .  3 , 4 ) .",
    "they vanish at bigger wavevectors when the time correlation functions behave like those for a noninteracting system .",
    "it is necessary to underline that all the functions after a sufficiently long period begin to decay purely exponentially in time as  @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the relaxation time .",
    "the wavevector - dependent relaxation @xmath218 as well as the correlation @xmath219 times for the finite and infinite systems are shown in fig .",
    "at @xmath220 we have found for the finite - system function @xmath221ps and @xmath222ps .",
    "as was pointed out above , the correlation functions have been evaluated in the finite time interval @xmath223 [ 0 , 2ps ] .",
    "the relaxation times will be used by us to calculate contributions at time integration for @xmath224ps , where all the correlation functions exhibit almost purely relaxation behaviour .",
    "we indicate the longest tails in the time correlation functions for the infinite system at @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "these functions remain positive anywhere in time space , contrary to the stockmayer fluid with the dipolaron behaviour [ 1 , 25 ] of dipole moment fluctuations .",
    "now , we are in a position to discuss the result of calculations ( 4 ) for the longitudinal wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant @xmath7 of the tip4p water .",
    "real @xmath227 and imaginary @xmath228 parts of @xmath229 are shown in figs .  6 and 7 as solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "the calculation of the frequency - dependent dielectric constant for the tip4p water has already been dealt with in the paper [ 6 ] . in this paper , however , the dielectric relaxation was investigated at zero wavevector value only . moreover ,",
    "the simulation results here were actually deduced within the pdrf potential rather than the exact isrf geometry .",
    "as has been concluded previously [ 16 ] , investigating the wavevector dependence of the dielectric constant of the mcy model , and shown above for the wavevector - dependent kirkwood factor @xmath132 of the tip4p water ( see fig.1 ) , it is risky to use the pdrf geometry for systems of hundreds molecules . although it is hard to tell except by numerical computations whether the results [ 6 ] for the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant differ significantly from the exact results corresponding to the macroscopic system .",
    "for this reason we have repeated the calculation of the frequency - dependent dielectric constant @xmath230 .",
    "the result of these calculations , performed in the isrf geometry , is shown in fig .",
    "6a . comparing the previous result ( cf .",
    "fig .  6 of ref .  6 ) with our one , we can observe that apart from the slight differences in the low frequency regime the agreement is quite good for higher frequencies .",
    "therefore , the dielectric constant is less sensitive to boundary effects at intermediate and high values of frequency .",
    "since all the correlation functions decay exponentially at great times , in the low frequency regime the dielectric permittivity behaves like the debye dielectric for arbitrary wavevectors .",
    "deviations can be visible at higher frequencies and at small and intermediate wavevector values , where the collective molecular librations take an important role in forming the polarization fluctuations . above some @xmath2=1 - 10 thz , where thz = ps@xmath231 , the relaxation process gradually changes into a resonance process characterized by an frequency of 60 - 200 thz ( which depends on wavevector ) and reflecting the rapid librational motion of the molecules .",
    "the main differences at zero wavevector between the frequency - dependent dielectric constant for the tip4p water , debye and stockmayer models as well as real water have been done already [ 6 , 26 ] .",
    "now we consider differences in the behaviour on frequency between the longitudinal dielectric constant of the tip4p water and the stockmayer model [ 1 ] at nonzero wavevector values .    despite",
    "a similar overall shape of @xmath7 to that of the stockmayer fluid , additional features emerge for the tip4p water , namely , a second maximum in the imaginary part @xmath232 at @xmath233 and a more complicated structure for the real part @xmath234 at @xmath235 .",
    "for example , the real part @xmath234 for the stockmayer system always increases at increasing frequency , while we can observe clearly additional maximum and minimum for the tip4p water in the librational resonance range .",
    "although the tip4p model does not reproduce the dielectric properties of water at all well , since it does not account for polarizability and the coupling of inter- and intramolecular motions , a similar structure in the dielectric constant of real water for nonzero wavevector values may be present as well , because in real water the librational frequency is well separated from the lowest intramolecular vibration [ 27 ] .",
    "it is interesting also to point out that the dielectric constant of the tip4p water at frequencies @xmath236 thz practically does not depend on wavevector in the range @xmath237 and even up to @xmath238 at @xmath239 thz and remains the same as in the low wavevector limit ( cf .",
    "the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant at great wavenumber values is shown in fig .",
    "as we can see , the correct value of nonpolarizable systems in the infinite wavevector and frequency limit , @xmath240 , can only be obtained if the dielectric constant is known up to about @xmath241 and @xmath242 thz .",
    "it is worth to remark also that at @xmath243 the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant can be reproduced quantitatively using the analytical formula ( a3 ) for the time correlation functions of a noninteracting system .",
    "the dielectric constant , calculated in such a way , is shown in fig .",
    "6f - h and fig .  7 by circles .",
    "the dielectric constant @xmath7 at fixed real values of wavevector and frequency describes the response of the system on longitudinal electric fields in the form of monochromatic plane waves , i.e. , when @xmath244 .",
    "arbitrary inhomogeneous fields can be presented by a set of the plane waves via the time and spatial fourier transform .",
    "therefore , the response on such fields can be determined integrating the corresponding monochromatic contributions over the frequency and wavenumber spectrum using @xmath7 .",
    "the necessity of introducing pure imaginary frequencies @xmath245 with @xmath246 arises in the problem of finding electric fields @xmath247 in the system when the external field is turned off . such damping in time electric fields",
    "can be obtained using the dispersion relation @xmath248 [ 28 ] .",
    "it can be seen from figs .",
    "6 , 7 that this relation is not satisfied at real frequencies .",
    "so that , contrary to transverse electromagnetic waves , longitudinal monochromatic waves can not propagate without external sources of charges . from the fluctuation formula ( 4 )",
    "it follows that @xmath249 when @xmath250 .",
    "the last limit can be achieved at imaginary frequencies @xmath251 only , where @xmath252 .",
    "thus , the electric fields are damped exponentially with the characteristic interval of order of the relaxation time .",
    "maximal life times of the longitudinal electric excitations are observed at spatial inhomogeneity of @xmath253 ( see fig .  5 ) and consists about 1.6ps .",
    "strong spatially inhomogeneous fields ( @xmath129 ) disappear immediately after disappearing external supporting fields .",
    "finally , we consider some aspects of applying the well - known kramers - kronig relations to the longitudinal wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant . in general , these relations connect real @xmath254 and imaginary @xmath255 parts of the function @xmath256 of frequency as @xmath257 from the mathematical point of view the relations ( 15 ) are fulfilled if the function @xmath258 can be presented in the form @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is a real analytical function of time .",
    "then , taking into account the fluctuation formulas ( 4 ) , it can be shown that in two cases at least , namely , when @xmath261 and @xmath262 for arbitrary @xmath1 , the kramers - kronig relations will be satisfied . at the same time it is not obvious that these relations must be valid for the function @xmath263 at @xmath264 .",
    "we have established on the basis of our numerical analysis that the kramers - kronig relations can apply to the longitudinal dielectric constant in the form @xmath265 at such wavenumbers only , where the static dielectric constant @xmath5 takes positive values , i.e. , when @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "physically , the impossibility to use the function @xmath268 for the transformations ( 15 ) at arbitrary wavenumbers lies in the fact that , in fact , the external field @xmath43 , but not the total field @xmath269 , can be considered as an independent parameter which causes time varying all observing quantities in the system .",
    "a fluctuation formula suitable for the self - consistent calculations of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant for interaction site models of polar systems has been rigorously derived in the situation that is typical for computer simulations . using this formula ,",
    "the longitudinal component of the dielectric constant has been evaluated by the md method for the tip4p model of water in a very wide scale of wavenumbers and frequencies .",
    "the most striking feature of interaction site models consists in existing of the libration oscillations in the shape of longitudinal time - dependent polarization fluctuations and this feature is reproduced by the tip4p potential as well .",
    "we have showed , however , that the libration oscillations vanish at increasing wavenumber .",
    "choosing the correct microscopic variable for polarization density , which corresponds completely to interaction site models , allows us to investigate the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant for arbitrary wavevector values . at the same time",
    ", it has been corroborated by the explicit calculations that the pd approximation is unsuitable , in general , for evaluating the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant of interaction site models of polar fluids .",
    "since it has now been shown that the calculation of the wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant in computer simulations for a given interaction site model is practical in principle , we believe that this fact will stimulate further research in both theory and pure experiment .",
    "a next paper of this series will be devoted to a more complicated case , namely , to the calculation of the transverse wavevector- and frequency - dependent dielectric constant for the tip4p water .",
    "we now consider the time dependence of the longitudinal wavevector - dependent kirkwood factor @xmath270 in the free motion regime . in this case , molecules are statistically independent of one another and , therefore , nonzero contributions to @xmath205 give only the self ( intramolecular ) part of terms with coincident molecular indexes @xmath271 of summation ( a1 ) .",
    "the site velocities of molecules can be presented as @xmath272 , where @xmath273 and @xmath274 are the translational and angular velocities of the @xmath18th molecule , respectively .",
    "we note that according to the euler equations , the angular velocities depend on time even for free rotational motion , so that @xmath275 , where @xmath276 { \\rm d } t'$ ]",
    ". then , taking into account that the translational and angular velocities of each molecule are distributed independently at equilibrium , the expression ( a1 ) transforms into @xmath277    the first averaging in ( a2 ) can easily be evaluated applying the maxwell distribution @xmath278 with respect to the cartesian components ( @xmath279 ) of the translational velocity @xmath280 , where @xmath281 is the mass of the molecule . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath282 .",
    "the second averaging in ( a2 ) is not reduced , in general , to an analytic form .",
    "however , due to the fact that the gaussian multiplier @xmath210 quickly decays to zero with increasing @xmath13 at @xmath264 , we can cast the solution for @xmath283 into the taylor series by writing @xmath284 t + { \\cal o}(t^2)$ ] , where @xmath274 and @xmath285 are taken at time @xmath121 and terms of order @xmath286 and higher have been neglected .",
