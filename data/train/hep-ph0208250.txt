    "the axial coupling constant of the nucleon , deduced from measurements of neutron beta decay , is known to be @xmath0 @xcite in vacuum .",
    "strict chiral invariance would have this ratio be unity , and the substantial difference suggests a deviation in excess of current quark mass effects .",
    "thus it has long been argued that the increase in @xmath1 is a result of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking that characterizes the qcd vacuum .",
    "although additional chiral - invariant meson - nucleon couplings can remedy this problem in the linear sigma model @xcite , a more fundamental explanation is warranted .",
    "the issue is complicated by the difficulties experienced by lattice qcd practitioners @xcite , in that such calculations tend to yield values significantly lower than experiment .",
    "possible explanations have recently centered on finite - size effects @xcite , although the specific physics is unresolved @xcite .",
    "one might also try to deduce the nucleon s axial coupling by studying that of a constituent quark , denoted in this paper as @xmath2 . in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath3 but incomplete knowledge of the quark wave function",
    "leaves the relativistic corrections unknown .",
    "however there has been considerable success in treating the nucleon as massive constituent quarks @xcite , and if the deviation of @xmath1 from unity is in fact due to chiral forces the constituent approach should encompass the relevant physics . at the quark level chiral symmetry",
    "also demands an axial coupling of unity , which generates an excess of nucleon axial charge when eq .",
    "( [ nrratio ] ) is directly applied .",
    "studies addressing this predict negative corrections of @xmath4 to @xmath2 , using the mit bag model @xcite , in the large-@xmath5 limit @xcite , or via perturbative corrections @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider corrections to @xmath2 from instantons . the instanton liquid model ( ilm ) , in which the qcd vacuum is populated by classical gauge configurations @xcite ,",
    "dynamically generates the constituent quark mass and has consistently led to phenomenological success when applied to problems related to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . as detailed below , we find a 25% reduction in the axial coupling from instantons , with only slight sensitivity to the chiral limit .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with experiment if corrections to eq .",
    "( [ nrratio ] ) are small .    to determine the axial coupling we will first carefully analyze the axial current . since instanton - induced interactions between quarks are non - local , the currents associated with conserved quantities are non - trivial .",
    "next , given the necessity of pions in axial phenomena , meson correlation functions are briefly reviewed .",
    "we then derive the axial current and verify the importance of the pion pole in the axial form factor , @xmath6 .",
    "finally , the leading corrections to the coupling @xmath2 are computed , taking into account multi - instanton effects and substantial non - local vertex corrections . in the chiral limit",
    "we find @xmath7 and estimate that with a physical pion mass @xmath8 . with naive application of eq .",
    "( [ nrratio ] ) , these correspond to a nucleon axial couping of 1.22 and 1.28 , respectively .",
    "the effects of an instanton liquid background are most economically encoded in an effective quark action @xcite .",
    "taking the exact zero - mode solutions to the dirac equation and isolating them as the dominant low - energy effects leads to a @xmath9-quark vertex function @xcite , similar to the nambu  jona - lasinio model of qcd @xcite .",
    "a well - studied simplification of this model , chiral random matrix theory , has shown that chiral symmetry breaking via random overlap integrals reproduces dirac eigenvalue correlations as computed on the lattice @xcite .",
    "thus such an approach seems to indeed contain the essence of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "furthermore , the ilm relies on only two parameters : the instanton density and average instanton size .",
    "both of these were phenomenologically fixed long ago with the vacuum energy density and chiral condensate @xcite and measured on the lattice @xcite .",
    "these parameters determine the diluteness of the instanton liquid , the ratio of the average size to inter - instanton spacing , to be about 1/3 , a somewhat small parameter which allows for perturbative treatment of the instanton - induced vertex .",
    "the eulcidean effective action for @xmath10 flavors in the chiral limit is written @xcite , @xmath11 ,   \\label{oldsint}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the instanton s @xmath13 color / spin orientation matrix and @xmath14 is its position .",

    "we have left out additional ( quarkless ) @xmath18 terms which relate this coupling constant , which is in fact a lagrange multiplier , to the instanton density , @xmath19 .",
    "because of non - locality eq.([oldsint ] ) is not invariant under symmetry transformations . since bulk observables",
    "are often insensitive to this problem it is usually ignored , however when addressing currents the dependence is crucial .",
    "a literature exists in which non - local interactions are modified to be invariant @xcite and we follow the same procedure here . taking the non - local four - fermion interaction as the starting point ,",
    "it then becomes a matter of multiplying each quark operator by a path - ordered exponential in the background of a source gauge field @xmath20 , replacing the euclidean quark fields as : @xmath21 with the operator @xcite @xmath22 as has been pointed out in the cited works , the operators @xmath23 must be path - ordered and the choice of path integrated over is not unique .",
    "however , we are primarily concerned with the longitudinal currents , for which results are independent of any particular choice of path @xcite .",

    ", we assume larger masses for the internal meson propagators . with the physical pion mass , @xmath95 mev , the instanton calculations of hutter @xcite generate a sigma mass of @xmath96 mev .",
    "reevaluating , we naturally find a deduction in these subtractions , @xmath97 however , this is a mere 5% increase compared to the chiral limit , and in fact places the result extremely close to the pseudo - experimental value .",
    "we are ultimately interested in the nucleon axial coupling , and in the non - relativistic limit we find @xmath98 the physical value , @xmath99 @xcite , lies in between .",
    "through an analysis of current conservation in the instanton liquid model , we found that terms arising from the non - locality of the t hooft vertex were central to maintaining the symmetries of the theory .",
    "this can be thought of as a correction for the truncation of quark basis states , for we have isolated the zero modes and removed them from the dynamics . reintroducing the symmetries to the volume of this extended interaction vertex via path - ordered exponentials recovers the symmetries , as has been noted by other authors some time ago @xcite .",
    "a general form of current corrections has been computed here , followed by specialization to the axial iso - vector case .    after these modifications the pion pole appears as a @xmath80-channel quark - antiquark correlation , governing each constituent quark s axial form factor and maintaining current conservation .",
    "similar multi - instanton corrections , when applied with @xmath81-channel chiral mesons , lead to an axial coupling constant of the quark of @xmath7 . in the non - relativistic limit this corresponds to a nucleon coupling of @xmath100 , within four percent of the experimental value . away from the chiral limit ,",
    "when the pion is set to its physical mass , agreement improves to within one percent .",
    "these numbers are obtained with the two standard inputs of the instanton vacuum , the number density and average size , and no additional parameters .",
    "while there are additional corrections from vector mesons , the significantly lower coupling constants and higher masses render them negligible . however , the non - local current terms lead to contributions comparable to the local ones and can not be disregarded .",
    "our results suggest that the ilm contains the primary effects which lead to the observed vacuum axial coupling of 1.267 .",
    "given that this variance from unity is a likely result of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , a central result of the ilm , it is not surprising that instantons contribute favorably .",
    "it is , however , noteworthy in its implication that relativistic wave function corrections to the constituent quark are nearly negligible .",
