    "it is now commonly accepted that most stars form in clusters of 100 or more stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , young ob stars nearly always appear in groups and clusters of lower mass stars @xcite . clearly , understanding the process of forming stars in clusters is of considerable importance .",
    "although we have an increasingly detailed picture of relatively isolated star formation in nearby dark clouds such as those in the taurus complex , our understanding of formation in clusters has been hindered by greater observational and theoretical challenges .",
    "observationally , the challenges of studying embedded clusters are their distance , their spatial density , and their association with high column density molecular clouds . while the taurus complex provides a number of examples of isolated star formation at 160  pc ,",
    "most clusters are at distances of 300  pc or greater @xcite , and thus require greater angular resolution and sensitivity to study .",
    "the stars in these regions may be closely spaced , again requiring high angular resolution to resolve the individual stars .",
    "finally , many clusters are deeply embedded , and are thus obscured to observation at visible wavelengths .",
    "for this reason , the importance of young stellar clusters was not realized until infrared cameras with detector arrays became available @xcite . with the latest generation of wide field cameras on 6 - 10 meter class telescopes , near - ir observations",
    "can now probe a large sample of young clusters with the sensitivity to detect objects well below the hydrogen burning limit , the angular resolution to resolve high density groupings of stars , and the field of view necessary to observe the distribution of stars over multi - parsec distances .",
    "furthermore , the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope is now providing detailed images of young clusters in the mid - ir , allowing us for the first time to identify young stars with disks and infalling envelopes efficiently in clusters out to 1  kpc and beyond ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    theoretically , the problem of star formation in clusters is perhaps an even greater challenge , as a realistic analysis must include a network of non - linear processes , such as turbulent motions and shocks in the natal molecular cloud , potential collisions and multi - body interactions between young stars and protostars , and the destructive influence of radiation and winds from the newly formed stars .",
    "numerical models of turbulent fragmentation have been successful at simulating the formation of clusters ( or at least clusters of protostellar gravitationally bound cores ) and these simulations are beginning to yield a wealth of theoretical predictions which can now be investigated observationally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for example , numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite of turbulent , initially spherically symmetric , jeans unstable molecular clouds produce collapsing , non - uniform filamentary density structures which are formed through the dissipation of kinetic energy by hydrodynamic shocks , allowing gravity to overcome turbulent support and force collapse . in these simulations",
    ", the gas eventually fragments into small ( @xmath2  au ) , self - gravitating , sub - virial clumps , which are interpreted as protostars .",
    "the models produce multiple groups of protostars which eventually merge to form large clusters",
    ". however , these simulations have obvious limitations : there are numerical problems associated with following the collapse of gas from parsec to 100  au size scales , the models assume idealized initial conditions , and the models also do not take into account the feedback from the newly formed stars . in particular , the later stages of the evolution in these models may have questionable relevance to real clusters given that most young stellar clusters do not evolve into bound clusters , in part due to the dispersal of most of the binding mass before it forms stars @xcite .    with increasingly sophisticated numerical models beginning to predict the spatial distribution and densities of young stars , it is an appropriate time to explore the configuration of young stellar clusters through wide - field infrared and submillimeter imaging , both to test current models and to guide the development of future models . through the analysis of the stellar surface density in young ( @xmath3  myr ) stellar clusters still associated with their natal molecular gas , and through a comparison of the corresponding dust and gas density structure",
    ", we can study the initial configuration of young clusters and their subsequent dynamical evolution .",
    "we are now engaged in a multi - wavelength study of the structure of young stellar clusters , including ground - based near - ir data , _ spitzer _ mid - ir imaging , and ground - based submillimeter and millimeter - wave imaging @xcite .",
    "while testing cluster formation models is a long - term goal of the project , this paper is primarily focused on developing quantitative techniques for analyzing the spatial structure of young stellar clusters and applying these techniques to new observations of three clusters .",
    "subsequent papers will apply these techniques to the full sample of clusters observed in our survey .",
    "it is our hope that this work will encourage modelers to provide more accessible observable quantities from their simulations .    in this paper , we present an initial analysis of near - ir and submillimeter imaging of three clusters using near - ir images from flamingos on the 6.5  meter mmt telescope and 850  @xmath1 m continuum maps from scuba on the jcmt . we restrict our near - ir analysis to an @xmath4 color - based extinction analysis and the distribution of sources detected in the @xmath5band .",
    "the @xmath5band is the most sensitive to embedded young stars @xcite , and thus gives the most unbiased view of the distribution of point sources .",
    "although the membership of individual sources can not be established by the @xmath5band data alone , statistical methods can be used to infer the overall distribution of young sources .",
    "this approach is particularly appropriate for studying the densest parts of young clusters , where the density of young stars dominates over the density of field stars in the line of sight . in a future paper",

    "this technique can underestimate the extinction since the average ( @xmath4 ) color can include a contribution from young stars embedded in the molecular cloud ; these stars have extinctions below the total line of sight extinction through the cloud and bias the extinction toward lower values .",

    "thus , the kmh has been used to study the initial mass function of young stellar clusters . in this paper , we limit our analysis first to determining the magnitude at which the contamination from field stars begins to dominate the @xmath5-band number counts , and second , to estimating the total number of stars in each cluster .",

    ", such methods actually erase asymmetric structure which may yield vital insight into the process of clustered star formation . to examine the azimuthal distribution of sources and determine whether the clusters presented show a high degree of azimuthal asymmetry , we construct azimuthal distribution histograms for each of the three clusters .",
    "specifically , we count the number of stars in the cluster - dominated region that are located in @xmath66 position angle bins sampled at @xmath67 , the nyquist rate .    to quantify the azimuthal asymmetry of a cluster , we first compute the standard deviation of the histogram about the mean number of stars per azimuthal bin .",
    "we assume that this is the combined statistical noise of the cluster distribution and the field star distribution .",
    "we define the _ azimuthal asymmetry parameter _ ( @xmath68 ) of a young stellar cluster as the ratio of the measured standard deviation of the azimuthal distribution to the square root of the mean number of stars per azimuthal bin .",
    "given @xmath69 uniform overlapping @xmath70 azimuthal bins with @xmath71 stars in the @xmath61 bin and mean @xmath72 stars per bin , the raw @xmath68 is computed as follows : @xmath73    a circularly symmetric cluster has a random azimuthal distribution .",
    "therefore its azimuthal distribution histogram should be uniform to within poisson noise , as should a uniform distribution of contaminating field stars .",
    "this implies that a combination of both also has a uniform azimuthal distribution .",
    "given successful isolation of a subset of stars in a region which is dominated by cluster members , either via the statistical methods described above or via true population restriction such as the consideration of stars exhibiting excess infrared emission only , a quantitative statistical argument for the presence of significant asymmetric structure can be made using the measured @xmath68 .",
    "note that better isolation of cluster members reduces additional noise from the random field star distribution , yielding a stronger statistical argument .",
    "one additional complication is that variable extinction can introduce asymmetry in the background stellar distribution .",
    "this must be accounted for in order to properly isolate any asymmetry that is due to the cluster distribution . similarly to section  [ radial ] , we can measure the distribution of stellar contamination in azimuth using the monte carlo simulations performed in section  [ kmh ] .",
    "we measure the azimuthal distribution histogram of the stars that fall in the cluster region boundary of the @xmath58 contamination models , and divide each bin by @xmath58 . subtracting this mean model distribution from the observed one",

    "the exponential fits of the subtracted radial profiles ( see section  [ radial ] ) are used as the reference radial density distributions for our model circularly symmetric clusters .",
    "the number of cluster members in a given model is a poisson - deviate of the integrated exponential component of the radial density profile fit .",
    "the stars should be distributed uniformly in position angle about the measured cluster center point of the observations , but we must account for reduced effective sensitivity to low mass cluster members in higher extinction areas . to do this ,",

    "each of the @xmath78 young cluster fields generated is analyzed identically to the observations .",
    "the refined cluster center points are computed , using the center point measured from the observations as the initially chosen point which is then further refined .",

    "low average and peak stellar densities within the cluster , overall lack of significant stellar density structure , and a significantly larger cluster core radius are circumstantial evidence that recent expulsion of the bulk of the gas mass from the cavity has allowed the cluster to dynamically expand to its current state .    in the two embedded clusters there is also evidence that the star  forming gas and dust are being disrupted .",
    "while stellar density morphology seems related to dust emission morphology in the embedded clusters , peak stellar densities are often anti  correlated to dust emission maxima , suggesting that either local extinction variation severely affects our sensitivity to stars or stellar feedback mechanisms are already dispersing natal material locally near high stellar densities .",
    "for example , in ggd  12 - 15 , the peak of stellar density is located at a local minimum in 850  @xmath1 m emission , suggesting that the central stars may be opening a cavity in the dense central cloud core .",
    "similarly , subcluster  b of iras  20050 + 2720 is just outside the region of peak 850  @xmath1 m emission , possibly indicating that it too has dispersed much of its gas , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "subcluster  b may be entering a phase of dynamical expansion similar to what we suggest to explain the current state of the ngc  7129 cluster , while the remaining filament is still actively forming stars in subclusters  a  and  c and the small millimeter emission cores detected nearby @xcite .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of stellar distributions for the young stellar clusters ggd  12 - 15 , iras  20050 + 2720 , and ngc  7129 , which range in far - ir luminosity from 227 to 5.68  @xmath0 and are all still associated with their natal molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the data used for this analysis includes near - ir data obtained with flamingos on the mmt telescope and newly obtained wide - field 850  @xmath1 m emission maps from scuba on the jcmt . </S>",
    "<S> cluster size and azimuthal asymmetry are measured via azimuthal and radial averaging methods respectively . to quantify the deviation of the distribution of stars from circular symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> we define an azimuthal asymmetry parameter and we investigate the statistical properties of this parameter through monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of young stars is compared to the morphology of the molecular gas using stellar surface density maps and the 850  @xmath1 m maps . </S>",
    "<S> we find that two of the clusters are not azimuthally symmetric and show a high degree of structure . </S>",
    "<S> the ggd  12 - 15 cluster is elongated , and is aligned with newly detected filamentary structure at 850  @xmath1 m . iras  20050 + 2720 </S>",
    "<S> is composed of a chain of three subclusters , in agreement with @xcite , although our results show that two of the subclusters appear to overlap . </S>",
    "<S> significant 850  @xmath1 m emission is detected toward two of the subclusters , but is not detected toward the central subcluster , suggesting that the dense gas may already be cleared there . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to these two highly embedded subclusters , we find an anti - correlation of the stars and dust in ngc  7129 , indicating that much of the parental gas and dust has been dispersed . </S>",
    "<S> the ngc  7129 cluster exhibits a higher degree of azimuthal symmetry , a lower stellar surface density , and a larger size than the other two clusters , suggesting that the cluster may be dynamically expanding following the recent dispersal of natal molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> these analyses are further evidence that embedded , forming clusters are often not spherically symmetric structures , but can be elongated and clumpy , and that these morphologies may reflect the initial structure of the dense molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , this work suggests that gas expulsion by stellar feedback results in significant dynamical evolution within the first 3  myr of cluster evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate peak stellar volume densities and discuss the impact of these densities on the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar envelopes . </S>"
