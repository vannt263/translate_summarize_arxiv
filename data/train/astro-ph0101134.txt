    "the most promising dark matter candidates appear to be weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and in particular the so - called neutralinos , arising in supersymmetric scenarios as well as much heavier particles ( wimpzillas ) which could have been produced non - thermally in the early universe ( for a review of particle candidates for dark matter see e.g. ellis ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "the annihilations of these x - particles would generate quarks , leptons , gauge and higgs bosons and gluons .",
    "consequently @xmath0 pairs would be produced either directly or by successive decays of mesons , and they are expected to lose their energy through synchrotron radiation as they propagate in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "this radiation is expected to be greatly enhanced in the proximity of the galactic centre , where the existence of a massive black hole creates a region of very high dark matter particle density and consequently a great increase in the annihilation rate and synchrotron radiation .",
    "we discuss in section 2 the distribution of dark matter particles in our galaxy and in particular around the central black hole , following gondolo & silk ( 1999 ) ( from now on , paper i ) . in section 3",

    "among the products of annihilation of dark matter particles , there will be electrons and positrons , which are expected to produce synchrotron radiation in the magnetic field around the galactic centre .",
    "the @xmath0 component produced by the hadronic jets has been computed using the mlla approximation .",
    "the galactic magnetic field can be described using the equipartition assumption , where the magnetic , kinetic and gravitational energy of the matter accreting on the central black hole are in approximate equipartition ( see melia ( 1992 ) ) . in this case",

    "comparable to the size of the region where most of the annihilations occur , the electrons lose their energy almost in place . to see this , consider the critical synchrotron frequency @xmath19 i.e. the frequency around which the synchrotron emission of an electron of energy e , in a magnetic field of strength b , peaks , namely @xmath20 inverting this relation , we find the energy of the electrons which give the maximum contribution at that frequency , @xmath21    the typical synchrotron loss length for an energy corresponding to @xmath22 can be expressed as a function of the distance @xmath23 from the central black hole for the magnetic field profile in eq .",

    "furthermore the lower limit of integration of expression [ la ] is @xmath58 @xmath59    using the approximation introduced in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) we find for @xmath54 the following expression @xmath60 which can in turn be used to evaluate @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ la ] ) and @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ anu ] ) .",
    "note that the synchrotron loss time - scale is proportional to @xmath61 we compare this with the annihilation time , which determines where the inner density drops drastically : @xmath62 in other words , the annihilation time goes to zero more rapidly than the synchrotron loss time as @xmath23 goes to 0 .",
    "hence synchrotron losses are important throughout the annihilation region .",
    "extension to the wimpzilla mass range introduces far more uncertain physics .",
    "the wimpzilla cross sections strongly depend on new physics beyond the electroweak scale . similarly to the case of electroweak gauge bosons , one can expect a general scaling @xmath63 for the self - annihilation cross section where @xmath64 is some dimensionless gauge coupling . in four dimensional field theory",
    ", the conservation of probability ( unitarity ) roughly corresponds to this scaling for @xmath65 ( see , e.g. , weinberg ( 1995 ) ) . in order to retain generality",
    ", we will therefore consider wimpzilla annihilation cross sections in the range @xmath66 .",
    "we note , however , that beyond four dimensional field theory , such as in theories with extra dimensions and in string theory , larger cross sections may be possible .",
    "we first evaluate the self - absorption coefficent for selected values of the mass , as a function of frequency .",
    "the result , shown in fig.[absnu ] , is a coefficent which grows from very low values ( showing that absorption is important at 408 mhz ) and then reaches the value 1 , around a frequency which is strongly dependent on the cross section and the mass @xmath67 , but not so much on the profile power law index @xmath3 . on the left",
    "the above coefficent is evaluated for two different values of the cross section , the first one corresponding to the maximum possible value ( the so called unitary bound , see griest & kamionkowski ( 1990 ) ) and the second one corresponding to typical cross sections one can find in supersymmetric scenarios ( see , e.g. , bergstrom , ullio & buckley ( 1997 ) ) .    the right part of fig.[absnu ] shows the self - absorption coefficent at the fixed frequency of 408mhz as a function of the neutralino mass .",
    "the behaviour shown is qualitatively the same for any value of the cross - section and for different @xmath3 . in figure [ predi1 ]",
    "we compare the predicted spectrum with the observations ; we choose a set of parameters @xmath67 , @xmath3 and @xmath68 in order to reproduce the observed normalisation .",
    "it is remarkable that in that way one can reproduce the observe d spectrum over a significant range of frequencies .",
    "the set of dark matter parameters for which the fluxes predicted in our model are consistent with observation is shown in the exclusion plot of fig .",
    "[ excludo ] .",
    "the boundaries of the excluded range represent the parameter values for which the observed flux is explained by the dark matter scenario discussed here .",
    "we have shown that present data on the emission from sgr a * are compatible with quite a wide set of dark matter parameters .",
    "the evaluation of synchrotron self - absorption has enabled us to reach an alternative conclusion from an earlier claim of incompatibility of cuspy halos with the existence of annihilating wimp dark matter .",
    "our final result is that the experimental data on sgr a * spectrum at radio wavelengths could be explained by synchrotron emission of electrons produced in the annihilation of relatively massive dark matter particles , extending from tev masses to @xmath69 .",
    "the former is relevant to recent studies of coannihilation ( boehm , djouadi & drees ( 2000 ) ) , that suggest that wimps with @xmath70 can extend up to several tev , and the latter is relevant for particles ( wimpzillas ) that are produced non - thermally in the primordial universe .",
    "we have found that with the current data situation , the synchrotron emission tends to give somewhat sharper constraints on masses and cross sections than the gamma - ray fluxes ( cf .",
    "baltz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .",
    "this situation could be reversed by more sensitive gamma - ray observations anticipated from upcoming experiments .",
    "however the synchrotron predictions are uncertain because of our relative ignorance about the magnetic field strength near the central black hole , and gamma ray fluxes are subject to similarly uncertain amounts of self-absorption.the antares neutrino experiment will eventually be able to set a relatively model - independent limit on the annihilation flux from the galactic centre .",
