    "most quantum experiments produce results that can not be predicted with certainty .",
    "no matter how we improve our experimental techniques , this uncertainty will not diminish . any attempt to explain why this is",
    "so will of course depend on which theory is used to describe the quantum world . in this paper",
    ", we will explain the origin of quantum randomness and uncertainty from the standpoint of adopting ( non - relativistic ) bohmian mechanics@xcite as that theory .",
    "both classical mechanics and bohmian mechanics are deterministic theories .",
    "this means that the specification of the complete state of a ( classical or bohmian ) system at one time _",
    "@xmath0 _ , together with the laws of the theory ,",
    "is compatible with only one state of the system at any other time @xmath1 .",
    "so , if the complete state of a ( classical or bohmian ) system is specified at one time , the whole history of the system is determined .",
    "obviously , the two theories differ in terms of their laws and also in what needs to be specified in order to provide a complete characterization of a system . in classical mechanics , the state of a system is fully characterized if the velocities and positions of the particles that constitute the system are provided at an initial time .",
    "in contrast , a complete characterization of a bohmian system requires both the initial positions of its constituent particles to be given and also the initial wave function that guides them .",
    "very often , determinism is associated with absolute predictability . however , this association is unjustified .",
    "for instance , if a classical system is chaotic , since its state can only be known with a finite degree of precision , its evolution after a period of time will be uncertain . moreover , if the system is macroscopic and has some @xmath2 particles , measurement of all the initial conditions ( the position and the velocity of each particle in the system ) is not practically possible .",
    "but , without knowledge of the initial conditions that completely characterize the state of the system , its future evolution can not be predicted .",
    "these sources of unpredictability in classical systems are also found in bohmian mechanics .",
    "there are , however , two fundamental differences between classical and bohmian unpredictability",
    ".    the first difference has to do with the experimental accessibility of the state , i.e. , the initial conditions .",
    "we usually determine the initial conditions of a system by measuring them . in classical mechanics  and despite all the practical difficulties mentioned above ",
    "the idea that the initial conditions of a system can ( theoretically ) be measured is not problematic .",
    "we will show that in bohmian mechanics this is not the case .",
    "it follows from the dynamical laws of bohmian theory themselves that the wave function of a system can not be measured .",
    "in addition , if the wave function is somehow known and we want to subsequently measure the positions of the particles , this measurement process itself will unavoidably modify the initial wave function .",
    "the second difference between classical and quantum theories has to do with the typical initial conditions that can be assumed in scenarios where their exact values can not be known .",
    "most quantum experiments are analyzed by assuming the initial wave function of the system to be given ( say , by means of a suitable procedure of preparation of the system ) .",
    "thus , in order to analyze quantum experiments , only a statistical assumption regarding the distribution of the initial positions of the particles is needed .",
    "the so - called quantum equilibrium hypothesis states that the distribution of the positions of particles is given by the modulus squared of their wave function @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is of paramount importance , since it allows us to quantify precisely the the degree of quantum uncertainty in an experiment and it guarantees the empirical equivalence of bohmian mechanics and the standard quantum - mechanical approach .",
    "now that we have given this brief introduction to the topic , we can advance that the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we discuss why , according to bohmian mechanics , the initial conditions can not be properly measured .",
    "first , in subsection [ sec21 ] , we briefly introduce the dynamical laws of the theory and we discuss the distinction between the universal wave function , the conditional wave function and the effective wave function of a subsystem ; since these distinctions are important for understanding the origin of uncertainties in bohmian mechanics",
    ". then in subsection [ sec22 ] , after explaining why in classical mechanics the initial conditions can in principle be measured , we show why the wave function can not be measured ; and finally , we show that a measurement of position typically disturbs the wave function . in section [ sec3 ] , we introduce the quantum equilibrium hypothesis , explaining its meaning in subsection [ sec31 ] , its justification in subsection [ sec32 ] and in subsection [ sec33 ] , the absolute unpredictability of quantum mechanics that emerges as a direct consequence of quantum equilibrium hypothesis . next , in section [ sec4 ] , we add some further considerations concerning the relation between randomness , measurement and equilibrium",
    ". then finally , in section [ sec5 ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we want to highlight the differences between classical measurements and bohmian measurements .",
    "as we have just mentioned , we will show that , according to bohmian mechanics , there are fundamental limits to the possibility of determining the initial conditions of a given system through measurement  a sort of limit that we do not find in classical measurements . due to this inherent limitation on the determination of the initial conditions , the subsequent evolution of the system can not be predicted .      throughout this section",
    "we will be mainly concerned with the dynamics of bohmian mechanics .",
    "so , in what follows we present the basic dynamical laws of the theory@xcite .",
    "we take advantage of this presentation to introduce three different types of ( bohmian ) wave functions that are relevant for our later discussion . for ease of exposition and understanding ,",
    "we will focus on a non - relativistic bohmian world with spinless particles living in a one - dimensional physical space .",
    "the generalization to a 3d physical space inhabited by particles with spin does not change any of our conclusions .",
    "bohmian mechanics is a quantum theory in which the complete state of the whole system of particles in the universe , say @xmath3 , is given by the _",

    "( [ scho ] ) , the universal wave function at a given initial time , @xmath15 , must be specified .",
    "as we say above in the introduction , bohmian mechanics is a completely deterministic theory in the sense that specification of the complete state of the universe at one initial time , @xmath16 , together with the laws given in eqs .",
    "( [ scho ] ) and ( [ velo ] ) , is compatible with just one state of the universe for any other time @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in this regard ,",
    "the dynamical laws of bohmian mechanics are as deterministic as the dynamical ( newtonian or hamiltonian ) laws of classical mechanics",
    ".    the following continuity equation for the modulus squared of the wave function can be straightforwardly obtained from eq .",

    "( [ continuity ] ) that if this initial distribution is given by @xmath21 , then the dynamics preserves the form of this distribution ; that is , for any other future time @xmath17 , the distribution is @xmath22 .",

    "we are not concerned with the whole universe but with smaller subsystems , i.e. , a particle or a collection of particles in our laboratory . however , the wave function that appears in the postulates of bohmian mechanics , eqs .",
    "( [ scho ] ) and ( [ velo ] ) , is the universal wave function , @xmath4 .",
    "if we want the theory to make contact with real applications , we need some tools that enable us to refer to and to characterize arbitrary subsystems of the universe . in bohmian mechanics ,",

    "it is usual to refer to the set of all particles except @xmath23 as the environment of @xmath23 .",
    "note that whereas the universal wave function is a function defined in the @xmath3-dimensional configuration space of the universe , the conditional wave function is a function only of @xmath24 ( and time ) .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ velo ] ) , that the velocity of @xmath23 is given by the function @xmath28 through the corresponding guidance equation : @xmath29 therefore , all the dynamics of a quantum ( sub)system can be inferred from its conditional wave function . however , in general , the conditional wave function does _ not _ evolve according to the schrdinger equation , but it obeys its own ( more complicated ) equation @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the potential that appears in eq .",

    "( [ eq_conditional ] ) demonstrates that such a single - particle wave equation exists ; however , we do not know the exact form of the terms @xmath33 and @xmath34 because to know these terms we would need to have complete knowledge of the ( universal ) wave function @xcite .",
    "our ignorance of these terms is certainly a source of uncertainty in our predictions .",
    "this source of uncertainty is of the sort that appears in ( classical or quantum ) open systems due to the interchange of particles and energy with the ( unknown ) environment .      while the evolution of the conditional wave function for a quantum subsystem is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_conditional ] ) , which is not exactly the schrdinger equation , bohmian theory provides the concept of the _ effective _ wave function of a quantum subsystem , whose equation of motion is exactly the schrdinger equation .",

    "we emphasize that the effective wave function of a quantum ( sub)system does not always exist ; however , when the effective wave function exists , it is equal to the conditional wave function in eq .",
    "( [ effective ] ) and recalls that , by assumption , @xmath32 lies within the support of @xmath38 .",

    "( [ continuity ] ) , a new continuity equation can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq_effective ] ) : @xmath45 whenever in orthodox quantum mechanics a definite wave function is attributed to a given subsystem , that wave function corresponds with the bohmian effective wave function .",
    "we will see in subsection [ sec31 ] that eq .",
    "( [ continuity2 ] ) guarantees equivariance , which will be relevant to ensure the empirical equivalence between bohmian and orthodox quantum mechanics .",
    "bohmian mechanics is a holistic theory . strictly speaking , its postulates eqs .",
    "( [ scho ] ) and ( [ velo ] ) only apply to the universe as a whole . therefore , when it comes to assessing the ontology of the theory , the fundamental objects are the particles with positions @xmath6 and the universal wave function @xmath4 .",
    "as we have seen , in order to deal with subsystems of the universe , the conditional wave function is introduced .",
    "the conditional wave function of a given subsystem is not fundamental but it supervenes on the fundamental @xmath46 and @xmath47 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq - guid - cwf ] ) , it can be seen that the complete dynamics of a subsystem is determined once both its conditional wave function and the initial positions of its constituent particles are specified .",
    "thus , we can say that the complete state of a subsystem is given by its conditional wave function and the position of its particles  even though its conditional wave function is not a primitive object in bohmian mechanics .    the conditional wave function for a subsystem does not evolve according to the schrdinger equation , but is a solution of the more complicated eq .",
    "( [ eq_conditional ] ) .",
    "yet we have seen that , when a subsystem is sufficiently decoupled from its environment so that the conditions for it to have a well - defined effective wave function are satisfied , then its effective wave function actually does obey the schrdinger equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq_effective ] ) . in this case , once again the evolution of the system is determined when both the initial positions of its constituent particles and its effective wave function are specified . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "when we refer to the wave function of a given subsystem of the universe , we are of course referring to its conditional wave function ( or to its effective wave function , if the system has one ) even if we do not make it explicit .",
    "we next want to highlight the contrast between classical and bohmian mechanics when it comes to experimentally determining the initial conditions of a system . in order to do so , in subsection [ sec221 ]",
    "we discuss a very simple model of a classical measurement interaction represented by an impulsive hamiltonian .",
    "it will follow from this discussion that , in principle , both the position and the velocity of a particle can be measured without an appreciable perturbation .",
    "then , in subsection [ sec222 ] , we show why the wave function can__not _ _ be measured ; and in subsection [ sec223 ] , we show that a bohmian measurement of the position typically disturbs the wave function .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional classical system ( object ) of mass @xmath48 and the measurement of the property @xmath49 of the system , where @xmath50 is the position coordinate of the object and @xmath51 its momentum . to perform the measurement",
    ", we consider a pointer , whose position and momentum are denoted by @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively .",
    "we assume that the hamiltonian governing the interaction between the object and the apparatus has the following form : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a coupling constant .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system - plus - apparatus is composed of the interaction term @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ al1 ] ) plus the kinetic energy of the object and of the apparatus .",
    "we consider that during the course of the interaction @xmath56 is the only relevant term in the hamiltonian .",
    "then , the classical equations of motion can be obtained by substituting eq .",
    "( [ al1 ] ) into hamiltons equations : @xmath57 it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ al3 ] ) that the value of the time derivative of the position of the apparatus is correlated with the value of @xmath58 . from eqs .",
    "( [ al2 ] ) and ( [ al4 ] ) , we see , however , that the variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 are disturbed during the measurement process . however",
    ", such disturbance can be made arbitrarily small by assuming @xmath59 . from eq .",
    "( [ al5 ] ) it follows that the momentum of the pointer remains constant during the whole interaction ( its temporal derivative is zero ) .",
    "therefore , if we consider @xmath60 at the initial time , the expressions eqs .",
    "( [ al2 ] ) and ( [ al4 ] ) are greatly simplified . in this case , the above equations can be easily integrated , yielding : @xmath61 now it can be seen that neither the position of the object nor its momentum are altered during the measurement process .",
    "we would like to note that from the second expression in eq .",
    "( [ al9b ] ) , the value of @xmath62 can be determined if the initial and final positions of the pointer , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are known .",
    "given these results , it is easy to show how we can measure the position and momentum of the object at the same time without causing a significant disturbance their values .",
    "to do this , we just assume an interaction with two pieces of apparatus ( whose pointers are represented on this occasion by the variables @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , respectively ) so that the interaction hamiltonian is now : @xmath67 where @xmath55 and @xmath68 are the coupling constants between the object and the first and second pieces of apparatus , respectively . applying simplifications analogous to those in the previous case ,",
    "the following equations of motion are obtained : @xmath69 if the position of the respective pointers at the end of the interaction is known , then both the position and the initial velocity of the object can be directly inferred from eq . ( [ al9 ] )",
    "having this knowledge is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for precisely predicting the posterior behavior of the particle .",
    "as we will see next , in bohmian mechanics the detailed initial conditions of a system can not be properly measured , so in the context of this theory not even this necessary condition can be met .",
    "as we have repeatedly stressed , the initial conditions of a quantum system are its wave function @xmath70 and the initial positions of its constituent particles . as opposed to what happens in the classical case , in bohmian mechanics one of the initial conditions  the wave function  cannot be properly measured @xcite .",
    "the argument leading to the non - measurability of the wave function is rather simple and only the linearity of the quantum dynamical laws needs to be assumed .",
    "we are interested in developing an apparatus that is capable of measuring the wave function @xmath71 of an object with position variable @xmath50 .",
    "we will assume that such measuring apparatus is an additional quantum system whose final pointer position @xmath72 allows us to infer the wave function that is subjected to the measurement .",
    "let @xmath73 be the ( effective ) wave function of the apparatus when it is in the initial state ",
    "ready for the measurement  where @xmath52 is the position variable of the apparatus .",
    "when needed , we will refer to the ( effective ) wave function of the composite system as @xmath74 .",
    "we consider , for the sake of our argument , two possible initial wave functions of the object , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which allows us to define two different initial wave functions of the composite system , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "a proper measurement interaction must provoke a correlation between the wave function of the system and the pointer of the apparatus , so that the two initial wave functions , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , are associated with two different values of the pointer s position at the end of the measurement .",
    "the temporal evolution of the joint wave function @xmath74 leading to the desired correlation between the object and the apparatus is given by the linear schrdinger equation : @xmath81 where the term @xmath82 is responsible for the proper correlation between any @xmath71 and @xmath83 .",

    "note that such a state always exists in the hilbert space of the object system .",

    "but the former result is imposed by the requirement that , for all possible final positions of the pointer @xmath133 , the conditional / effective wave function @xmath134 must be equal to the initial effective wave function of @xmath50 : @xmath126 .",
    "the evolution represented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] has a dramatic consequence .",
    "it does not produce any dynamical correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath119 .",
    "it can be accepted that , by chance , the pointer may indicate @xmath135 nm when the position of the system is @xmath136 nm .",
    "yet there will be no such coincidence for other possible initial positions of the pointer .",
    "in fact , according to the quantum equilibrium hypothesis , which we discuss in more detail in the next section , there are infinitely many bohmian trajectories such that , while the pointer ends in position @xmath137 nm , the position of @xmath50 is not @xmath136 nm but any other value .",
    "so it is clear that the interaction represented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can not be considered a measurement of @xmath50 position .",
    "a final remark is required here .",
    "we can conceive a rather special universe in which , for all systems initially characterized by the wave function @xmath138 that undergo the interaction we are now considering , the available initial positions @xmath139 are initially distributed in such a way that the pointer @xmath140 shows an apparent correlation with @xmath141 in spite of both variables @xmath50 and @xmath52 evolving independently .",
    "for example , imagine that our special universe only contains the following 5 initial pairs of particles positions that are deterministically associated with the final pairs of particle positions indicated :     at the final time @xmath122 and ( filled - in circle ) the corresponding ( bohmian ) position @xmath127 in the two - dimensional configuration space for one particular experiment .",
    "the evolution of @xmath132 implies a perturbation in the @xmath52 direction , but an unperturbed evolution in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "such an interaction can not be considered as a good measurement of the position because , due to equivariance and the guidance law of effective wave functions , eq .",
    "( [ velo_eff ] ) , the final value of the pointer @xmath142 is compatible with many different positions of the system @xmath143 .",
    "( color figure online ) . ]",
    "@xmath144    in fact , the apparatus is not doing anything ; the initial conditions of our universe are so special that it seems that there is a perfect correlation between @xmath143 and @xmath72 : when the system is in @xmath145 the final pointer indicates @xmath146 without distorting the wave function of the system , when the system is in @xmath147 the final pointer indicates @xmath148 without distorting the system wave - function , and so on .",
    "such a universe is certainly possible , but highly atypical .",
    "assuming that such an atypical universe ( or other universes with similar pathologies ) can be disregarded , we have shown that a measurement of the initial position that does not disturb the wave function is not possible .",
    "summing up , the results in subsections [ sec221 ] , [ sec222 ] and [ sec223 ] show the fundamental differences between classical and bohmian mechanics regarding the possibility of experimentally ascertaining the initial conditions of a system .",
    "both are deterministic theories but , while according to the former we can in principle measure the initial conditions and possibly make a precise prediction of the future evolution of a system , this is not the case according to the latter .",
    "we can now see these same results under a new light .",
    "since in bohmian mechanics we can not measure the state of a system , this entails that we do not have any means to experimentally select or produce a set of systems that are guaranteed to be identical  in the same bohmian state .",
    "imagine that we have a collection of electrons all prepared so that their effective wave function is the same . from the standpoint of the orthodox quantum - mechanical approach ( and of any quantum theory that assumes that the wave function alone provides a _ complete _ description of a system ) , these electrons are identical as they have the same wave function .",
    "if we measure a property and we obtain different results , it will be puzzling .",
    "we are then forced to accept indeterminism and that there is no cause of the different results . from the standpoint of bohmian mechanics ,",
    "however , the electrons are not identical : even if they have the same effective wave function , their positions ( relative to the wave function ) need not be the same .",
    "therefore , there is no puzzle if they behave differently and produce different results upon measurement .",
    "different initial ( bohmian ) states give different final results !    given that we can not make a finer - grained selection procedure ( discerning at the same time the wave function and the positions ) , the fact that we can not make precise predictions concerning the future evolution of each electron is naturally accounted for : we can not do so because we lack information on the complete state of each individual system . as we will see in the next section ,",
    "the most we can do is adopt a statistical treatment of our ensemble , making a guess as to the distribution of the positions given the wave function .",
    "on the one hand , we have explained in subsection [ sec222 ] that the wave function can not be measured . on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown in subsection [ sec223 ] that , even when the wave function is properly `` prepared '' , a measurement of the position of a particle necessarily perturbs the `` prepared '' wave function ( unless the latter is very close to a delta function in the position representation ) .",
    "these results concerning our ignorance of the initial state of the wave function and the initial positions of the particles imply an unavoidable unpredictability in the deterministic bohmian theory . at this point , the reader may wonder whether these conclusions are in conflict with the  weak measurement \" techniques that have recently attracted a lot of attention both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view @xcite .",
    "in particular , the work entitled `` direct measurement of the wave function '' @xcite shows the first experimental reconstruction of the transverse spatial wave function of a photon .",
    "the experimental procedure for such a reconstruction is the following .",
    "two consecutive measurements are done in a quantum system with a well prepared wave function .",
    "the first measurement performs a _ weak _ measurement of the position , which implies a _ weak _ perturbation of the wave function .",
    "the second measurement is done on the previously weakly perturbed wave function through a projective  strong  measurement of the momentum that finally _ collapses _ the wave function .",
    "the above two consecutive measurements are repeated in many experiments , each one with an initial wave function  prepared \" in an identical way .",
    "then , from all the experiments , only the experiments whose measured momentum gives a particular value are selected ( and the rest of experiments are disregarded ) .",
    "the average value of the measured position computed only from the set of experiments that have been previously selected allows to reconstruct the wave function .",
    "a discussion of this experimental procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the average value obtained from the above procedure ( that provides information beyond that obtained from standard projective  strong  measurements ) is called the `` weak value '' .",
    "does the so - called `` direct measurement '' of the wave function in ref .",
    "@xcite contradict the main result of subsection [ sec222 ] ?",
    "obviously , no . throughout this paper (",
    "unless otherwise indicated ) , we refer to a measurement as the procedure to get an outcome from a single experiment .",
    "the value of a measurement of a single experiment can be related to a position of a ( measuring apparatus ) pointer while , by its own construction , a weak value can not be related with the position of a pointer in a unique experiment .",
    "therefore , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is not the type of `` direct measurement '' that we were dealing with in this paper .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite do also use the word `` direct '' in their title to differentiate their experiment with weak values from another experimental technique , quantum tomography@xcite , which estimates the wave function from a collection of projective ( strong ) measurements of observables .",
    "each observable in this tomographic technique is obtained from a different experiment with an identically prepared wave function .",
    "we prefer here to use the words `` direct measurement '' when the information is obtained from an individual quantum system in a unique experiment ( with a single- or multi - time measurement ) . with our definition , extracting information of the wave function from quantum tomography@xcite or from weak values@xcite can not be considered a direct measurement of the wave function , because it is not done in a single experiment . for the same reason ,",
    "experiments involving weak values of the ( bohmian ) velocity can not be considered as direct measurements of the ( bohmian ) trajectories @xcite .",
    "when it comes to discussing phenomena such as uncertainty , unpredictability and randomness from the standpoint of bohmian mechanics , most authors start with the quantum equilibrium hypothesis which is , in fact , the essential statistical consideration assumed in bohmian mechanics in order to determine the initial positions of particles probabilistically .",
    "as we will see , this hypothesis is crucial for establishing the empirical content of the theory and it guarantees the empirical equivalence of bohmian mechanics with ordinary non - relativistic quantum mechanics . yet here , we have preferred a different approach , showing first that certain limits on what can be measured arise in bohmian mechanics .",
    "this has been done without explicitly invoking the details of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis and focusing instead on the dynamical laws of the theory .",
    "these limits  which do not arise in classical mechanics  in turn imply limits on what can be predicted .",
    "we ended the last section with the idea that if we have a collection of systems prepared similarly ( with the same effective wave function ) , then we can not control their positions , since measuring the positions would perturb the wave function .",
    "while it could therefore seem as if no prediction can actually be made , the quantum equilibrium hypothesis comes to our rescue with an explicit suggestion of how the positions of systems with the same wave function are statistically distributed . in",
    "what follows , when describing the quantum equilibrium hypothesis and its implications , we are reviewing in general the work of drr , goldstein and zangh from 1992 in ref .",

    "therefore , the empirical equivalence of bohmian mechanics and quantum mechanics is satisfied when the quantum equilibrium hypothesis is considered .",

    "the crucial aspect expressed in eq .",
    "( [ cond - prob ] ) is that such knowledge ( precise information on the subsystem @xmath119 ) must be mediated by @xmath71 . but in bohmian mechanics , @xmath71 does not merely represents our knowledge of the system ; it also has an important and crucial dynamical aspect , i.e. it guides the motion of the particles .",
    "this implies that the absolute uncertainty just introduced above embodies , when the specific dynamics is considered , _",
    "absolute unpredictability_.    in section [ sec2 ] , we use dynamical arguments to show that we can not know the position and the wave function of a subsystem of interest at the same time , because measuring the position always disturbs the wave function . in what follows ,",
    "we want to show that this is in perfect agreement with the statistical considerations introduced above in this subsection . in order to see this",

    "we will also consider that the interaction between the subsystems @xmath50 and @xmath52 constitutes a measurement of the position of @xmath50 : after the interaction , the final position of the pointer , @xmath72 , is suitably correlated with @xmath143 , so we can infer the latter with precision by looking at the former .",
    "finally , let us assume ( for the sake of the argument ) that the ( effective ) wave function of the system at the final time is equal to that function at the initial time , i.e. @xmath164 .",
    "now , this last condition contradicts eq .",
    "( [ cond - prob ] ) for the following reason .",
    "given the knowledge of the environment , we know the position of @xmath50 perfectly .",
    "for instance , the probability distribution of the position of @xmath50 ( conditioned by our knowledge that the final pointer position is @xmath165 nm ) is approximately @xmath166 . from eq .",
    "( [ cond - prob ] ) , it then follows that the ( conditional ) wave function after the measurement is , indeed , a delta function .",
    "however , above we also require that @xmath164 .",
    "the two requirements are incompatible , because @xmath167 ( unless our initial wave function was in fact a delta function , which contradicts our supposition ) .",
    "as can be seen from this example , it follows from the fundamental conditional probability formula that if , after an experiment , by knowing the position of the pointer we can infer with precision the position of the object , then the conditional wave function of the object after the experiment must approximate a delta function regardless of what the initial conditional wave function was .",
    "in section [ sec2 ] , we relate quantum randomness with our inability to measure the initial conditions of a quantum system .",
    "next , in section [ sec3 ] we claimed that quantum randomness arises because our universe is in quantum equilibrium .",
    "these two clarifications of the concept of quantum randomness may seem unconnected . in this section , we want to briefly argue that this is not the case and that the notion of measurement is indeed closely related with the statistical notions of equilibrium and non - equilibrium .      measuring implies obtaining knowledge of a system through the use of an apparatus . independently of whether we are considering a classical or a quantum measurement",
    ", such knowledge requires the existence of a correlation between the system and the apparatus ; a correlation that must be stable and robust enough to lead to the formation of a permanent record ( e.g. , a black spot on a photographic plate , a computer printout , etc . ) .",
    "we usually take the possibility of knowledge ( that is , the possibility of the existence of strong and robust correlations between different subsystems ) for granted .",
    "yet the fact that this type of correlations does exist depends on how our universe works ; and its working could easily have been otherwise .",
    "consider , for instance , the toy - model of a classical measurement that we introduced in subsection [ sec221 ] .",
    "the very fact that there is a macroscopic pointer that correlates with some property , @xmath49 , of a system , as represented by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ al1 ] ) , presupposes a scenario that is clearly out of equilibrium .",
    "if the whole universe were in thermodynamic equilibrium , no such macroscopic correlations could arise .",
    "therefore , the very possibility of measuring is related to the equilibrium conditions that hold in a particular situation .",
    "when it comes to thermodynamic equilibrium , the universe can be considered to be a sea of non - equilibrium with some islands of equilibrium .",
    "this fact regarding our universe allows for the ubiquitous existence of measuring - type interactions , such as those described by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ al1 ] ) . when it comes to quantum equilibrium , however , the situation is not the same .",
    "all the empirical evidence we have suggests that our universe is _ globally _ in quantum equilibrium .",
    "therefore , _ all _ systems are in quantum equilibrium and the limitations that this condition imposes upon measurements admit no exception . in the next subsection , we explore these limitations again .      we have shown that in classical mechanics it is possible to establish a perfect correlation between a pointer and the position of a particle . here , we now argue why the same measurement of position is not possible in a universe in quantum equilibrium .",
    "a quantum measurement of position also requires a correlation between @xmath143 and @xmath72 .",
    "the two positions are , however , in quantum equilibrium . because of this equilibrium , when we predict the ( bohmian ) position of the particle we have to treat @xmath168 and @xmath169 as random variables distributed according to @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , different experiments are associated with different random initial positions that , via the guiding law in equation ( [ velo_eff ] ) , will correspond to different @xmath143 and @xmath72 at the final time @xmath122 . by equivariance , after the experiment , the probability distribution of @xmath143 and @xmath72 is given by @xmath171 .",
    "therefore , the only way to really establish a close correlation between @xmath143 and @xmath72 in all experiments is through the quasi - delta function shown in fig .",
    "in contrast , quantum equilibrium implies that the type of wave function depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] will never provide perfect correlation between the system @xmath119 and the pointer @xmath83 ( the same value of the pointer indicating @xmath72 is compatible with many different positions of the system in different experiments ) .    finally , let us stress again that , as opposed to other types of equilibrium ( thermal , electrostatic or thermodynamical ) , quantum equilibrium does not require relaxation times .",
    "as evidenced by all experiments , our universe is in quantum equilibrium , and all subsystems satisfy the quantum equilibrium hypothesis at any time .",
    "this is just a consequence of the equivariant property of the universal wave function discussed in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "thus , there are unavoidable limitations to our knowledge of the positions of particles . in fact , once the wave function is prepared , there is an _",
    "absolute uncertainty _ regarding the positions of the particles .",
    "we have tried to answer the question : _ how does quantum uncertainty emerge from deterministic bohmian mechanics ? _ the equations of motion of classical and bohmian mechanics are both fully deterministic",
    ". however , to be able to determine the output of a ( classical or quantum ) experiment with certainty , we have to know the initial conditions of the system .",
    "we have seen that in classical mechanics , there are many scenarios where the initial conditions can be measured and therefore we can predict the future evolution of the system with certainty . meanwhile , in other classical systems ( such as chaotic systems or those involving a very large number of particles )",
    ", we can not determine the initial conditions with enough precision to make predictions about the future with certainty .",
    "in bohmian mechanics , the initial state of a system ( including both the positions of the particles and the wave function ) can not be determined experimentally .",
    "therefore , as our knowledge of the initial conditions is constrained , we can not predict the future evolution of the quantum system with certainty .",
    "the reader may realize that the foregoing answer as to how a ( classical or quantum ) deterministic theory becomes unpredictable is quite trivial .",
    "however , a look at the history of science shows that the unavoidable randomness of quantum systems opened an intense debate on the impossibility of using explanations based on deterministic laws for quantum phenomena .",
    "the famous ( and incorrect ) von neumann theorem@xcite and the related impossibility proofs are the most evident examples of the intensity of the arguments against deterministic quantum theories@xcite . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we show that the bohmian dynamical laws do not allow the measurement of a wave function in a single experiment . even assuming a _ preparation _ of the wave function ( not a measurement ) ,",
    "then the same laws do not allow us to determine the position of the particle without modifying the wave function ( unless the initial wave function is a position eigenstate ) . without the possibility of having experimental access to the initial conditions ,",
    "the deterministic bohmian theory becomes a theory that involves uncertainty in its predictions .",
    "we have not only provided an answer to the question regarding how the unpredictability of the results of quantum experiments can follow from a deterministic theory , but we have also introduced the fundamental statistical hypothesis that quantifies the amount of randomness that appears in quantum experiments . in classical systems , when the initial conditions are inaccessible , classical statistical mechanics provides probabilistic information on typical initial conditions . in quantum systems , since the initial positions of particles are always inaccessible via measurement ( without converting the initial wave function into a position eigenstate ) , the quantum equilibrium hypothesis determines the probability of different initial positions .",
    "this hypothesis is merely a consequence of the fact that our universe is always in quantum equilibrium ( in the sense discussed in section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "all the dynamical and statistical insights of bohmian mechanics can be summarized in the fundamental conditional probability formula , which states that the maximum information on the position of a particle can be obtained from the modulus squared of its ( conditional ) wave function : @xmath162 .",
    "stated simply , any knowledge of the particle positions must unavoidably be mediated by the wave function .",
