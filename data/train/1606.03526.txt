    "the epoch of reionization is a key time in the evolution of the universe , when the intergalactic medium ( igm ) transitioned from being neutral to being very highly ionized .",
    "determining when reionization occurred and finding the sources of the photons responsible is one of the major goals in current observational cosmology .",
    "ly@xmath1 emission is one of the few diagnostics of this epoch .",
    "since it can be modified by the radiative damping wings of a neutral igm , both the observed strength and the shape of the line are sensitive probes of the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the igm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a developing consensus that the fraction of star - forming galaxies with ly@xmath1 emission ( laes ) drops rapidly from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which could reflect a rapid increase in the neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm with increasing redshift .",
    "however , theoretical modeling of the evolution of the lae population is extremely difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is possible that this evolution may be driven by changes in the lae properties of the galaxies as well as by igm evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the galaxy itself produces a complex ly@xmath1 spectrum . at @xmath6 ,",
    "ly@xmath1 lines generally have red offsets but in some @xmath7 of cases show multi - component structures with blue wings @xcite .",
    "the profiles can be crudely understood in terms of the velocity and structure of infalling and outflowing gas in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at higher redshifts",
    "the igm begins to modify the profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "beyond about @xmath8 the ly@xmath1 forest begins to become optically thick @xcite and will scatter the blue side of the ly@xmath1 line ( and potentially some of the red side if there is infall of the igm to the galaxy ) out of the line of sight .",
    "this produces the asymmetric red profile that is characteristic of many of the laes .",
    "no multi - component lae profiles are seen in the @xmath9 lae study of @xcite or in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 lae samples of @xcite though there is wide variation in the degree of skewness in the lines .",
    "multi - component structure can only be seen in @xmath12 galaxies if they highly ionize their surroundings and this is most likely for the most luminous galaxies . as the igm becomes substantially neutral near reionization both",
    "the red and blue sides of the line will be suppressed by the radiative damping wings produced by the neutral part of the igm lying outside the galaxy s hii region .",
    "the size of this effect depends on the neutral density in the surrounding igm and also on the size of the hii region @xcite . in this case",
    "seeing the line at all depends on the formation of a large hii region and again this is more probable for the most luminous galaxies .    in the present paper",
    "we report the detection of the most luminous high - redshift lae yet seen .",
    "this galaxy , which we call cosmos ly@xmath1 1 ( cola1 ) , is the first high - redshift lae ( @xmath2 ) to show a multi - component velocity structure with a blue wing , which suggests that cola1 may indeed lie in a very highly ionized region of the igm .",

    "the final narrow - band area coverage of 3 deg@xmath13 is shown in the right panel of figure  1 , compared with the smaller narrow - band field of @xcite .",

    "two of these , masosa , and cr7 , were previously known and spectroscopically confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the imaging data shows cola1 to be about @xmath31 more luminous than cr7",
    ".    0.6 cm     we observed cola1 with the keck2/deimos spectrograph on march 6th 2016 , with the g830 grating using a @xmath32   slit , giving a resolution measured from the sky lines of 83 km s@xmath33 for the @xmath11 laes .",
    "three 20-min exposures were obtained , dithered by @xmath34 along the slit , to obtain precise sky subtraction .",

    "however , more surprisingly , it has a complex line profile with both blue and red components .",
    "the flux of cola1 is 1.4 times that of cr7 based on the spectroscopy . even excluding the blue wing , cola1 is still more luminous than cr7 , so the selection of cola1 is not biased by its unique profile .",
    "indeed , the shape of the red wing is almost identical in the two galaxies and almost indistinguishable from the stack of lower - luminosity line profiles given in @xcite ( figure  3 ) .     at @xmath57 .",
    "cola1 is plotted with the peak at the same offset . under this assumption",
    "the blue side extends to @xmath58 .",

    "( @xcite give a gaussian - fitted fwhm of 266@xmath5915 km s@xmath33 for cr7 . ) only the red side of cola1 lies above the half maximum so the fwhm relates to this component only .",
    "the measured rest - frame equivalent width of cola1 is 53  and that of cr7 99 , where in both cases we have measured the continuum to redward of the line .",
    "both masosa and cola1 are quite spatially compact . in the narrow - band image cola1",
    "has a measured fwhm of 0.93@xmath60 compared with the locally measured psf of @xmath61 giving an intrinsic fwhm of @xmath62 . in @xmath63",
    "the local psf is @xmath64 and the cola1 fwhm is 0.90@xmath60 giving an intrinsic fwhm of @xmath65 .",
    "this contrasts with cr7 which is quite diffuse @xcite .",
    "the present data gives an intrinsic fwhm of @xmath66 for cr7 .",
    "there is no sign of any 1240    emission though this lies in a noisier part of the spectrum where there are strong night sky lines .    at lower redshifts ( @xmath67 )",
    "@xcite suggest that almost all ly@xmath1 emitters with @xmath68 are associated with agn .",
    "however , the narrowness of the ly@xmath1 line ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the spatial extension of the galaxy and the absence of 1240  ( though the latter two constraints are weak ) combine to suggest that cola1 is primarily powered by star formation rather than agn activity",
    ". however , both cola1 and cr7 could have agn contributions to their emission .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the most luminous lae ever detected in the epoch of reionization has a unique and unexpected line profile .",
    "the simplest explanation for this surprising result is that cola1 lies in a highly ionized region of gas , increasing the ly@xmath1 forest transmission and thereby allowing us to see the blue side of the ly@xmath1 line profile .",
    "alternatively , the galaxy could be moving at a velocity of several hundred km s@xmath33 with respect to the igm , so that the ly@xmath1 profile has been moved redward of the effects of igm scattering .",
    "the compactness of the galaxy and the spatial alignment of the blue and red wings in the 2-d spectrum makes it unlikely the velocity structure is caused by a galaxy merger .",
    "@xcite have argued that there is little evolution in the luminosity function of the most luminous laes at these redshifts , suggesting that these objects lie in large hii regions and protect themselves from any changes in igm neutrality .",
    "this would be consistent with complex ly@xmath1 profiles being seen only in the most ultraluminous laes .    at low redshifts ( @xmath69 )",
    "about 30@xmath70 of laes show multi - component profiles @xcite .",
    "kulas et al",
    ".  argue that these galaxies are not strongly affected by igm opacity so that this fraction could also be applicable to the high - redshift galaxies enclosed in giant hii regions ( though of course the properties of the high - redshift galaxies may be very different ) . assuming that cola1",
    ", cr7 and masosa lie in this class then we do indeed see one galaxy in three having a complex profile , which would be crudely consistent .",
    "if this is the correct interpretation , then more complex profiles may be present in a fraction of the most ultraluminous laes .",
    "cola1 s velocity structure appears very similar to that of multicomponent laes at lower redshift though with lower velocities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the peak in the blue side has a maximum that is 0.44 times that of the red side and the velocity separation between the red and blue peaks is 215 km s@xmath33 . our assumed velocity offset places the trough between the peaks at 25 km s@xmath33 , close to the near - zero velocity seen in most low - redshift laes in @xcite .",
    "as discussed in  1 , interpreting the lae profiles is complicated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the velocity separation of the peaks and the redside velocity can be produced with an expanding shell with a velocity of @xmath71 but such a model would predict a much stronger red - to - blue ratio than is seen in cola1 , suggesting we also need significant infall . we postpone more detailed discussion until an an exact determination of the absolute velocity scale is obtained . however , if cola1 does have a strong inflow this might suggest that the galaxy is in an early formation phase and has a low metallicity",
    ". this would be consistent with the @xcite interpretation of cr7 as having a young , metal - poor stellar population .",
    "if we accept that the complex line s visibility is a result of hii region ionization , then we may be able to draw useful inferences about the igm and the escape of ionizing photons from the galaxy .",
    "unfortunately the reduction in the ly@xmath1 flux and the scattering of the blue side by the presence of the hii region depend on a very large number of parameters .",
    "the hii region size depends on the total number of ionizing photons from the galaxy and inversely on @xmath72 , the igm neutral hydrogen fraction .",
    "@xcite gives the size as    @xmath73    here r@xmath74 is in proper mpc and @xmath75 is the total number of ionizing photons released by the galaxy .",
    "@xmath75 depends on the star - formation rate of the galaxy , its initial mass functions , the ionizing photon escape fraction ( @xmath76 ) , and the age of the galaxy .",
    "it is correspondingly an extremely uncertain quantity . nevertheless , the hii region radius is generally large enough that we can largely ignore the effects on the ly@xmath1 line of the radiation damping wings of the igm outside the hii region unless the igm is substantially neutral @xcite .    in this case",
    "the amount of scattering in the ly@xmath1 profile is dependent only on the residual density of neutral gas in the hii region @xcite .",
    "this affects only the blue side of the profile where the gas lies at lower redshifts than the galaxy . the fractional neutral hydrogen in the hii region is given by @xcite as    @xmath77    here @xmath78 is the clumping factor",
    ", @xmath79 is the radial distance from the galaxy , and @xmath80@xmath81 is the rate at which the galaxy releases ionizing photons into the igm . translated simply , this predicts a large optical depth even for relatively low values of @xmath80@xmath81 .",
    "@xcite has values of @xmath82 near 100 for @xmath80@xmath83 s@xmath33 , characteristic of a moderate luminosity lae with a high escape fraction .",
    "however , the effects of structure must be taken into account since the transmission is dominated by lower - density regions and this significantly reduces the effective optical depth . with plausible assumptions",
    ", @xcite showed that this effect reduces the optical depth by almost three orders of magnitude , placing an optical depth of one on the immediate blue side of the lae for a galaxy with this value of @xmath80@xmath81 .",
    "thus it is plausible that a change in the lae properties occurs when @xmath80@xmath81 rises significantly above @xmath84 s@xmath33 and the hii region becomes effectively thin . if we assume this change occurs at around the ly@xmath1 luminosity of masosa ( @xmath85 ; sobral et al .",
    "2015 ) we can convert this to an ionizing photon release of @xmath86 , assuming the case b conversion to @xmath87 and a salpeter imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the two match for @xmath88 but the significant uncertainties in the computation of the optical depth arising from the hii region must be borne in mind .",
    "if this is correct we would expect to see a change in the structure of the lines at the transition point .",
    "below the critical @xmath80@xmath81 the effects of hii absorption should produce a sharp razor - edge cutoff at all positions on the galaxy , as indeed is seen in the lower - luminosity laes ( figure 4 ) where the cutoff essentially corresponds to the instrument profile . at higher luminosities",
    "the cutoff is just due to the profile emerging from the galaxy and can show variation across the galaxy , as is seen in both cola1 and cr7 .",
    "the discovery of cola1 at @xmath2  the most luminous lae ever detected near the reionization epoch and the highest redshift lae to show a multi - component structure with a blue wing  has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of the ionization of the igm by galaxies at @xmath11 .",
    "we suggest that the most luminous laes lie in hii regions which are sufficiently highly ionized by the galaxy to allow unscattered transmission of the blue side of the ly@xmath1 line .",
    "the transition ly@xmath1 luminosity at which this occurs allows an estimate of the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the galaxy .",
    "if this interpretation is correct then a substantial number of the most ultraluminous laes may show complex line profiles , and modeling of the profiles should allow us to determine the kinematic structure of the galaxies .",
    "large samples of ultraluminous laes should soon be available from wide - field surveys with hsc on subaru and should allow us to study these issues in detail .",
