    "geometric scaling @xcite is an interesting phenomenological feature of high energy deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "it is expressed as a scaling property of the virtual photon - proton cross section , namely @xmath4 @xmath1 is the virtuality of the photon , @xmath5 the total rapidity and @xmath6 an increasing function of @xmath5 , called the saturation scale @xcite . on the theory side of the problem ,",
    "it is convenient to work within the qcd dipole picture of dis @xcite . .",
    "in this framework , the geometric scaling @xmath7 appears to be a genuine property of the conveniently - normalised dipole - target forward scattering amplitude @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the size of the dipole and @xmath5 its rapidity .",
    "in fact , it is known that , if this amplitude verifies the non - linear balitsky - kovchegov ( bk ) saturation equation @xcite , this property is a mathematical consequence of the high - energy behaviour of the solution in terms of traveling waves @xcite . more precisely , the equation is shown to admit traveling - wave solutions which translate directly in terms of the geometric scaling property ( [ eq : defscaling ] ) .",
    "however , the bk equation is written for the dipole - target amplitude in the full @xmath10-dimensional transverse coordinate plane .",
    "hence , it is supposed to give solutions for the dipole amplitude @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the impact - parameter of the dipole projectile with respect to the target .",
    "saturation as a function of impact parameter has been studied either phenomenologically @xcite , in the framework of models @xcite , from a semi - classical approach @xcite , from numerical studies of the bk equation @xcite or from an analytic point of view @xcite . however , referring to solutions of the bk equation , the perturbative tail in impact parameter shows up fastly in the bk evolution @xcite .",
    "it appears difficult to be consistent in a region where the confinement is expected to dominate ( see discussions in refs.@xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we want to tackle the problem of non - forward amplitudes in the saturation regime from a new point of view , motivated by ( and by extension of ) the mathematical properties of non - linear evolution equations , used in refs.@xcite for the forward amplitude . in the present work",
    ", we shall stick to the framework of the bk equation but our method could be extended to different cases with the same mathematical features .    in refs.@xcite",
    ", it was shown that the bk equation for @xmath8 can be considered to lie in the same universality class than a well - known equation , namely the fisher or kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( f - kpp ) equation @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that these equations admit asymptotic traveling - wave solutions whose physical meaning @xcite is nothing else than the geometric scaling property .",
    "more generally , if some general features that we shall now point out are realized @xcite , one can infer the existence and the form @xcite of traveling wave solutions only from the knowledge of the linear part of the kernel @xcite .",
    "let us quote these general features , taking as an example the general structure of the f - kpp equations .",
    "it is known that they are governed by three types of terms : a `` diffusion term '' , a `` growth term '' and a non - linear `` damping term '' .",
    "in particular , suppose the `` damping term '' to be absent , the equation is restricted to its linear part and leads to an exponential rise of the solution with `` time '' together with diffusion in `` space '' .",
    "this is indeed characteristic of the bfkl kernel which governs the linear part of the bk equation . in more general cases , called",
    "`` pulled front '' cases in the literature @xcite , the presence of similar ingredients , together with a specific property of initial conditions being steep enough to carry along the critical regime of traveling waves , induces the existence and the form of traveling wave solutions .",
    "the key point is that the main features of these solutions can be determined only from the knowledge of the solutions of linear part of the equation , which is an easier task than looking directly for solutions of a non - linear equation .",
    "our starting point is the knowledge of the exact solutions of the bfkl equation for dipole - dipole scattering , which have been obtained using the conformal invariance of the bfkl kernel @xcite .",
    "our aim is the following : making use of the powerful mathematical properties of conformal symmetry , allowing to formulate exact solutions of the bfkl equation with impact parameter and/or momentum transfer , we can construct the solutions of the linear part of the bk equation .",
    "we shall then look for the kinematical domain where the ingredients allowing for the existence and derivation of traveling waves are present .",
    "namely , schematically ( these points shall be discussed more completely in the next section ) :    * a solution of the linear part of the equation with an exponential growth , * a non linear damping effect due to unitarity , * a steep enough initial condition .",
    "by contrast with previous approaches of non - forward amplitudes , we shall not try to get solutions in the full phase space ( which after all is not necessarily dominated by saturation effects ) but shall concentrate on kinematical regions where the mathematical requirements for traveling waves are fulfilled .",
    "the plan of our study is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : bindep ] , we recall in detail the derivation of the traveling - wave speed ( _ i.e. _ the saturation - scale energy dependence ) and of the wave front ( _ i.e. _ the amplitude ) in the case of the forward amplitude . in section [ sec : bdep ] , we derive the solutions of the non - forward bfkl dipole - dipole amplitudes in various representations : full coordinate space , a mixed one where the external particles are coordinate space dipoles interacting with a given momentum transfer @xmath13 and full momentum space where the external particles have given momentum @xmath14 in the next section [ sec : tw ] , we construct the solutions of the linear part of the bk equation and select the kinematical domains and representations in which one meets the abovementionned requirements and we derive the corresponding properties .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : ccl ] , we summarise our results and derive their main consequence , namely geometric scaling at nonzero transfer . we show how it provides a solution to the puzzling problem related to the confinement scale .",
    "we point out interesting phenomenological consequences of our solutions .",
    "for the full bfkl kernel . ]",
    "let us recall how traveling waves and geometric scaling emerge from the study of the bk equation for forward amplitudes .    in the large-@xmath15 approximation , it is well - known that the high - energy behaviour of the dipole forward scattering amplitude off a large ( _ e.g. _ nuclear ) target follows the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite where we neglect the impact parameter dependence .",
    "this equation can be put into the form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bfkl kernel and @xmath18 can be interpreted as the density of gluons in momentum space . here , @xmath19 with @xmath20 some fixed scale .",
    "the starting point of ref.@xcite is that , if we expand the bfkl kernel to second order around @xmath21 , this equation is equivalent , up to a change of variable , to the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piscounov ( f - kpp ) equation @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "looking to the different terms in the right hand side of ( [ eq : kpp ] ) , one can identify a `` diffusion term '' ( @xmath24 ) , an `` expansion term '' ( @xmath25 ) and a `` damping term '' ( @xmath26 ) , as explained in the introduction .",
    "this equation has been extensively studied and it has been proven that it admits traveling - wave solutions @xcite _ i.e. _ , at large time , the solution can be written @xmath27 with @xmath28 where the constants @xmath29 can be determined @xcite from the properties of the linear regime .",
    "if the initial condition behaves like @xmath30 with @xmath31 , these coefficients acquire critical values , whatever the value of @xmath32 is .",
    "in particular , the speed @xmath33 takes the critical value @xmath34 .",
    "the three coefficients are the only `` critical '' ones since they do not depend on the specific form of the non - linear damping . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it has been shown that this kind of feature is expected to be much more general .",
    "let us for instance show the properties of the critical regime , when the linear part of the evolution admits a superposition of waves for solution .",
    "one writes : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mellin transform of the linear kernel and @xmath37 is the position relative to the wavefront .",
    "then , the non - linear term drive the solution to the critical behaviour corresponding to traveling waves at large time @xmath38 the critical exponent @xmath39 corresponds to a wave having a minimal phase velocity equal the group velocity ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) : @xmath40 the appearance of traveling waves with critical velocity given by only depends on a few general conditions :    * @xmath41 is an unstable fix point of the equation , and @xmath42 is a stable fix point . *",
    "the linearised evolution equation admits solutions of the form .",
    "it generates a growth of the solution and non - linearities damp the solution and saturate it . *",
    "the initial condition is steep enough . if @xmath43 , this means that we want @xmath44 .    in particular , in the case of the @xmath12-independent bk equation , @xmath45",
    "and we find @xmath46 , as represented in fig.[fig : critqcd ] .",
    "as noticed in @xcite we expect @xmath47 due to qcd colour transparency and , therefore , the qcd evolution in rapidity will asymptotically reach the traveling wave regime which in turn corresponds to geometric scaling @xmath48 where the saturation scale @xmath49 grows as @xmath50 and the critical speed @xmath51 is @xmath52 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate in which kinematical regions one has similar properties from the bk equation in full phase - space .",
    "we shall first discuss under which circumstances the bfkl dynamics leads to solution of the form .",
    "we shall then show how we can obtain solutions for the linear bk equation and how non linearities lead to the formation of traveling waves and to geometric scaling .",
    "if we now take into account the @xmath12-dependence in the bk equation , we have to study the asymptotic solutions of @xmath53,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the conveniently - normalised dipole - target scattering amplitude . @xmath55 and @xmath56 are then the transverse space coordinates of the quark and antiquark constituting the dipole .",
    "this equation does not depend explicitly of the target whose centre of mass defines the origin .",
    "this non - linear equation corresponds to resumming qcd fan diagrams in the leading - logarithmic approximation @xcite .",
    "our main tool is to use the knowledge of the exact bfkl solutions @xcite for dipole - dipole scattering .",
    "we shall study the amplitude @xmath57 ( see fig.[fig : coord ] ) where we identify @xmath58 and @xmath59 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we impose that one dipole is bigger than the other ( @xmath60 ) . indeed ,",
    "if we want to use the dipole - dipole amplitude in order to study the dipole - target amplitude within the bk framework , we need to extract solutions of the linear part of the bk equation from the solutions of the bfkl equation .",
    "this is done by integrating out the target impact factor , and gives relevant results provided the convolution with the large dipole factorises from the smaller one .",
    "this separation criterium closely depends on the conformal invariance properties of the bfkl equation which is one of the basic properties of the non - forward linear bfkl dynamics @xcite .",
    "since our discussion may lead to different theoretical and phenomenological features , we shall perform our analysis in different spaces : the coordinate space , the mixed representation where we keep the dipole sizes in coordinate space but use the momentum transfer @xmath0 instead of the impact parameter , and the full momentum space .",
    "let us start from the well - known bfkl amplitude @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the centre - of - mass energy squared and @xmath0 is the momentum transfer .",
    "one writes @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the conformal eigenfunctions of the bfkl kernel with vanishing conformal spin quantum number ( @xmath65 in the usual terminology @xcite ) .",
    "it corresponds to the dominant contribution at high energy .",
    "@xmath66 ( resp .",
    "@xmath67 ) are the impact factors describing the coupling of the bfkl pomeron to the projectile ( resp .",
    "target ) , depending on the momentum transfer @xmath68 and on the dipole sizes @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the dirac distribution which appears in the definition of @xmath71 comes from the fact that , the global system being invariant under translation , the expression in the right - hand - side does not depend on @xmath72 . to be more precise , the relevant variables of this problem are the sizes of the two dipoles , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and the impact parameter @xmath75 , as shown on fig.[fig : coord ] . combining these expressions and using or @xmath76 as superscripts , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the same function . ]",
    "@xmath79 instead of @xmath76 , we obtain the following expression for the amplitude @xmath80 where we have introduced the function @xmath81 as the result of the integration over @xmath82 in @xmath83 using the complex representation for the two - dimensional vectors is @xmath84 in this section , we shall explicitly use @xmath85 when the modulus of the vector has to be considered.[foot : cplx ] ] ( in this section , we keep bold characters for vectors and ordinary ones for complex numbers ) , it has been shown @xcite that the result of this integration is @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the gauss hypergeometric function @xcite , the pre - factor @xmath88 and @xmath89 is the anharmonic ratio .",
    "this is a remarkable property due to conformal invariance that the bfkl pomeron exchange in coordinate space depends on @xmath9 , @xmath90 and @xmath12 only through the anharmonic ratio @xmath91 .    since we are interested in the situation where one small dipole of size @xmath9 scatters on a larger one of size @xmath90 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath92 , we can expand @xmath93 in series of @xmath94 . in that limit",
    ", the hypergeometric function goes to 1 and we obtain @xmath95 before going any further , one has to point out that the corrections to this expression are of order @xmath96 but reduce to @xmath97 if we integrate over the phase @xmath98 of @xmath9 ( see fig.[fig : coord ] for the kinematics ) .",
    "the expression still depends on the angle @xmath99 between @xmath90 and @xmath12 . since this is not relevant for phenomenological studies , it is interesting to integrate this result over the phases @xmath98 and @xmath99 of @xmath9 and @xmath90 ( one may assume that @xmath12 is real ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the legendre function of the first kind @xcite .    finally , if we additionally take @xmath12 going to zero in this result , we obtain @xmath102 which exhibits the same power behaviour as in the forward case .",
    "it is useful to introduce a mixed space representation @xcite in terms of @xmath9 , @xmath90 and @xmath0 .",
    "one obtains from @xmath103 where @xmath104 acquires a factorised form with @xmath105 using again the complex representation for the two - dimensional vectors , one finds ( see @xcite ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the bessel function of the first kind . using @xmath108 instead of @xmath76",

    "the final expression , using again the complex representation ( see footnote [ foot : cplx ] ) and replacing @xmath76 by @xmath79 , is @xmath133 as in the mixed space representation , this expression has the remarkable property of being _ factorised _ in @xmath134 and @xmath20 .",
    "this appears from the fact that we use the momentum transfer @xmath0 and is lost if we go back to impact - parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we can now consider these expressions in the case where one dipole is much harder than the other , corresponding to @xmath135 .",
    "thanks to the fact that @xmath81 is factorised in @xmath136 and @xmath137 , we again need to consider three situations : @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",

    "this limit gives @xmath150",
    "in this section , we investigate the consequences of our formul  for linear bfkl dynamics on asymptotic solutions when the non - linear effects of the bk equation are switched on .",
    "the key point is that linear bfkl dynamics can provide solutions for the linear part of the bk equation . indeed , when factorisation between the target and the projectile is fulfilled , the impact factor of the target can be integrated out keeping a linear evolution governed by the same kernel .",
    "it is thus a solution of the linear part of the bk equation which should depend only on the kinematic variables of the projectile .    in the next step",
    ", the asymptotic solutions of the bk equation can be deduced from the knowledge of its linear part , using quite general arguments which were recalled in sections [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : bindep ] . for each of the kinematical configurations introduced in the previous section",
    ", we check whether the conditions for the existence of traveling waves are fulfilled and , in these cases , derive their expression .",
    "let us first concentrate on the full momentum representation .",
    "we define the function @xmath151 depending only on @xmath152 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is remarkable that in this representation , the exact factorisation property of @xmath153 ( see ) gives rise to the simple expression @xmath154 where @xmath155 factorises out the target dependence , defining the initial condition , and @xmath156 is calculated in appendix [ ap : sl2c ] and enters in formula .",
    "it is obvious from the structure of , a linear superposition of eigenfunctions of the bfkl kernel , that it provides a natural basis for the solutions of the linear part of the bk equation in momentum space .",
    "therefore , we look for the kinematical domains where @xmath157 takes the appropriate exponential behaviour , corresponding to the wave superposition property discussed in section [ sec : bindep ]",
    ". it will lead to traveling - wave solutions for the full bk equation .",
    "we observe that , both in the cases 1 and 2 ( formul   and ) , _ i.e. _ in the limit @xmath158 , the solution of the linear part of the bk equation can be recast , using the symmetry @xmath159 , under the form @xmath160 where @xmath161 expresses the leading power - like behaviour at large @xmath162 and all remaining factors in @xmath120 and @xmath68 has been reabsorbed in @xmath163 .",
    "this clearly emphasises the fact that the region of interest is @xmath158 , independently of @xmath20 .",
    "by contrast , in the case 3 treating the large-@xmath0 expression , we see that equation , though being factorised , does not fulfil the same property .",
    "we thus do not expect traveling - wave solutions in this limit .",
    "let us now include the effect of the nonlinear term in the bk equation .",
    "due to colour transparency ( @xmath164 for @xmath165 ) , one can apply the general arguments exposed in section [ sec : bindep ] .",

    "this corresponds to the solutions of equation .",
    "this discussion can be translated to the amplitude in the mixed space representation of section [ sec : coord ] defining similarly @xmath173 where @xmath174 , given by , is the solution of the bfkl equation in the mixed representation . as for the case of the momentum space",
    ", the factorisation of the target and projectile dependences in the bfkl amplitude is the important property , leading to traveling waves when we include the nonlinear effects in the limit @xmath175 .",
    "the situation is not as simple in coordinate space .",
    "indeed , it is hard to introduce an amplitude depending only on @xmath73 and @xmath176 from equation .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that @xmath177 , depending only on the anharmonic ratio , can not be factorised . in the limit where the bk equation is valid ( @xmath178 ) , its linear part gives solutions of the form ( see ): @xmath179 where @xmath90 is the typical size of the target . as explained in section [ sec : bindep ] , this leads to traveling - wave solutions for the bk equation @xmath180 , where all trace of the impact parameter has disappeared .",
    "hence , it gives no information upon the @xmath12 dependence .",
    "we could instead consider equation when the scaling variable @xmath181 is large , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath182 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the bk equation makes sense physically in that limit where the dipole hits the target in its peripheral region ( @xmath182 ) . as explained above",
    ", these difficulties arise from the fact that @xmath9 and @xmath90 are mixed non - trivially in the anharmonic ratio .",
    "hence , an interpretation in term of the bk equation is problematic .",
    "by contrast , the situation in mixed and momentum spaces does not suffer this inconvenient , due to the nice factorisation property in @xmath9 and @xmath90 , or in @xmath134 and @xmath20 .",
    "let us first emphasise the main results of this paper . we show that traveling - wave solutions of the forward bk equation can be extended to the full equation including nonzero transfer @xmath0 , provided that @xmath165 , where @xmath134 represents the scale of the projectile .",
    "the saturation scale has the same energy dependence than in the forward case but is now proportional to @xmath0 . when this scale is large w.r.t .",
    "the scale , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath172 , characterising the target , the saturation scale thus becomes independent of the details of the target .",
    "but , when the momentum transfer @xmath0 is small w.r.t . the target scale , @xmath172 substitutes to @xmath0 in the saturation scale as expected from the forward case analysis .",
    "our results show that non - forward bkfl evolution with momemtum transfer @xmath0 in a presence of saturation at the scale @xmath3 is equivalent to forward bkfl evolution in the presence of saturation at the scale @xmath183 note that the similarity of a momentum transfer with an absorptive boundary in bfkl evolution has been noticed in ref.@xcite .    as a consequence of the existence of traveling - wave solutions , we derive the asymptotic form of the solution , _",
    "i.e. _ the wavefront , at small @xmath136 .",
    "it appears as an expression of the same form as in the forward case with two modifications : the saturation scale is now the proportional to @xmath0 and the pre - factor , related to the initial conditions , is now @xmath0-dependent .    from these considerations",
    ", we can predict that the bk equation implies the extension of geometric scaling at nonzero momentum transfer .",
    "indeed , using formula and noting that , at large @xmath134 , the impact factor of the projectile is expected to scale with the ratio @xmath184 where @xmath1 is a typical hard scale of the projectile .",
    "we see that the amplitude satisfies the geometric scaling under the form @xmath185    all these results apply also in the mixed - space representation depending on the projectile size @xmath9 and the momentum transfer @xmath0 . however , we find that these properties seem not to be easily expressed in terms of the impact parameter .    technically , the method used consists in three main steps .",
    "firstly , we analyse the form of the bfkl solutions in full phase space and in different pertinent limits .",
    "secondly , we use conformal - invariant properties of the bfkl dynamics to look for factorised solutions which then lead to solutions of the linear part of the bk equation .",
    "thirdly , we infer the traveling - wave solutions , induced by nonlinear effects , in the kinematical regions and for initial conditions where the universality properties of the bk equation apply .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "our formula suggests a solution to the puzzling problem of the compatibility of the bk equation with the confinement scale @xcite . the key point is to address the problem in momentum space where the non - perturbative dependence is factorised as clearly seen from the factor @xmath186 in equation , which may be characterised by a confinement scale .",
