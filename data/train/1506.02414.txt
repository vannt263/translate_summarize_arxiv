    "research on rank - size relationships has a long history and has been applied in a wide range of contexts . in this respect , at the inception zipf s law @xcite was illustrated through linguistics considerations , while pareto s law  a similar hyperbolic power law",
    " finds its origin in finance @xcite .",
    "however , among several applications , rank - size theory has a prominence in the field of urban studies @xcite . in particular , a relevant role is played by the analysis of the geographical - economical variables in the conceptualization of the new economic geography , introduced by krugman @xcite . in this respect , see berry @xcite , pianegonda and iglesias @xcite and the extensive surveys of ottaviano and puga @xcite , fujita et al .",
    "@xcite , neary @xcite , baldwin et al .",
    "@xcite , and fujita and mori @xcite .",
    "such an analysis can be satisfactorily developed through the study of the rank - size rule for regional and urban areas , on the basis of economical variables and the population size distribution , as shown here below .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the monograph of chakrabarti et al . @xcite for outlining interdisciplinary socio - econo - physics points of view .",
    "several studies proved empirically the validity of zipf s law @xcite ( or type - i pareto distribution @xcite ) : rosen and resnick @xcite , in 1980 , analyzed data from 44 countries , and found a clear predominance of statistical significance of zipf s law , with @xmath3 greater than 0.9 ( except in one case , thailand ) ; in mills and hamilton @xcite , data from us city sizes , in 1990 , has been taken to show the evidence of zipf s law ( @xmath4 ) ; see guerin - pace @xcite also . other papers , after 2000 , which substantially support this type of rank - size rule are dobkins and ioannides @xcite , song and zhang @xcite , ioannides and overman @xcite , gabaix and ioannides @xcite reed @xcite , and dimitrova and ausloos @xcite more recently , but with warnings , just to cite a few .",
    "nitsch @xcite provides an exhaustive literature review up to 2005 .    as other counter - examples , beside the above - mentioned case of thailand in @xcite and bulgaria in @xcite , weak agreement between data and pareto fit is sometimes pointed out .",
    "peng @xcite found a pareto coefficient of @xmath5 , not quite close to 1 , - when implementing a best fit of data on chinese city sizes in 1999 - 2004 with the pareto distribution .",
    "ioannides and skouras @xcite , among others , have argued that pareto - zipf s law seems to stand in force only in the tail of the data distribution .",
    "matlaba et al .",
    "@xcite also provided such an \" evidence that , at least for the analyzed case of brazilian urban areas over a spectacularly wide period ( 1907 - 2008 ) , zipf s law is clearly rejected .",
    "soo @xcite has also empirically shown that the size of malaysian cities can not be plotted according to such a rank - size rule , but a suitable collection of them can do it .",
    "a list of other contributions on the inconsistency of zipf s law in several countries , different periods and under specific economic conditions should include @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of particular interest , in the present case , is also garmestani et al .",
    "@xcite , who conducted an analysis for the usa at a regional level .",
    "thus , it seems that the failure of zipf s law may often depend on the way data are grouped @xcite    from the present state of the art point of view , regional agglomerations , commonly ranked in terms of population , may be also sorted out in an order dealing with the economic variables . in fact , zipf s law is sometimes identified in some  economic  way to rank . as an example , skipper @xcite used such a rank - size relationship to detect well developed countries hierarchy through their national gdp .",
    "this result has been also achieved by cristelli et al .",
    "@xcite , who exhibited evidence of the zipf s law for the top fifty richest countries in the 1900 - 2008 time interval .    _ in fine _ , the investigation , in the main text , aims to provide some newness , through some recent data ; even leading to a better description of a rank - size rule than the pareto - zipf s law .",
    "beside , to our knowledge , no statistical evidence of zipf s law studies has been reported for the economic variables characterizing italian cities and regions , in the period 2007 - 2011 .",
    "along such lines of thought and within our statistical physics framework , the paper deals with the rank - size rule for the entire set of municipalities in italy ( it , hereafter ) .",
    "this country , italy , is expected , according to its fame , to provide what a physicist looks for , i.e. some universality features but also some non universal ones .",
    "therefore , in an aim toward understanding nature and progressing toward reconciling so called hard and soft science , reliable data is investigated looking for `` universality '' and `` deviations '' .",
    "the it data are both official , and are given by aggregated income tax ( ati ) and number of inhabitants : the former has been provided directly from the research center of the italian ministry of economics and finance ( mef ) , and cover the quinquennium 2007 - 2011 ; the latter comes from the census 2011 , which has been performed by the italian institute of statistics ( istat ) .",
    "therefore , the _ size _ to be examined is here defined through two criteria : ( i ) by the ati _ contribution _ that each city has given to the italian gdp and ( ii ) by the _ population _ of each city .",
    "first , the 8092 italian cities are yearly ranked according to such variables .",
    "their related classifications are then compared : ( i ) at the national level , but also ( ii ) at the regional level .",
    "there are 20 regions in it with a varied number of cities .",
    "each specific year of the quinquennium has been examined . however , special attention has been paid to 2011 , in order to be somewhat consistent with the year concerned by the italian census report on population .",
    "the census took several years in fact .",
    "therefore , only the ati averaged over the 5 years interval for each municipality is reported in the main text and discussed through the mean value over 5 years of the yearly ati data .",
    "the conclusions are unaffected , as discussed in an appendix , except for some mild change in error bars on the numerical parameters , when specific years are selected for examination .    within the statistical physics approach interested in correlation functions",
    ", the paper also aims at observing whether there is or not some correlation between ati and population rankings . for this aim ,",
    "the kendall @xmath0 and the spearman @xmath1 rank correlation measures have been computed @xcite .",
    "the kendall @xmath0 measure compares the number of concordant and non - concordant pairs , to detect the presence of singularities in a possible relationship ( here between economy and demography ) .",
    "the spearman @xmath1 rank correlation is also computed , to provide a more satisfactory interpretation of the relationship between economy and demography in terms of rank @xcite .    a rank scatter plot of the number of inhabitants in each 8092 city versus the corresponding ati reveals two regimes .",
    "moreover , two regimes are also observed for the value themselves , distinguishing different `` phase states '' , pointing to regional specificities .",
    "it can be stressed @xcite that such a rank - rank analysis , implying pair correlations , is the analog of a correlation function , sometimes called susceptibility , in the linear response theory of statistical mechanics .",
    "it will be indicated that a `` rank '' is like a `` temperature '' .",
    "a useful methodological paper to read on the rank - rank correlation is by melucci @xcite .",
    "it contains also a bibliographic review on previous researches on this theme , up to that time . in order to obtain analytical expressions simulating the data , whence suggesting a model susceptible of general applications , various simple fits",
    "have been attempted .",
    "the most classical one , for universality purpose , is the straight line fit on a log - log plot .",
    "however , both for the population size and the ati data , it turns out that , in each region , the main city is an outlier : more precisely 25 cities for the whole country , i.e. about 1 per region .",
    "these lowest rank cities are markedly found to occur much above the usual expecting straight line data fit on a log - log plot ( the 20 `` regional '' plots are not shown for saving space ) .",
    "moreover , the fit visual appearances are not exciting , because our eyes receive the same effects from the low and high rank ranges .",
    "practically , it has been found that the regression coefficient @xmath3 improves if one removes these outliers .",
    "moreover , the fits visually improve in the asymptotic regimes , - which are very narrow regions , in particular in the high rank range",
    ". therefore , for shortening the paper , the parameters of the fits reported here below only concern fits with a 3-parameter function , discussed below .",
    "to get some perspective , notice that several contributions in the literature propose rank - rank analysis types within different contexts , - all comparing two different rank rules . in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "country ranking due to soccer team ranking ( and performance ) in uefa competitions is presented and contrasted with fifa ranking . in particular , in dealing with the rank - rank correlation @xcite , the kendall @xmath0 is employed .",
    "interesting is also the application in the context of archeology , with a specific focus on the aztec settlement distributions , presented in hare @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "zhou et al .",
    "focus on the rank - rank correlation for scientists and scientific journal , in line with the scientometrics literature . in this respect , see also @xcite , - on the relationship between authors and coauthors , and stallings et al .",
    "@xcite , - comparing researchers and universities according to different criteria , whence providing also an axiomatization of the rank and rank correlation problems . for what concerns the spearman @xmath1 coefficient , it measures correlations in the rank deviation from their mean of the measurements .",
    "as already said above , for completeness , @xmath1 will be calculated , even if kendall @xmath0 is usually acknowledged to have better statistical properties than spearman s",
    "@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of kendall @xmath0 also seems to be easier and more intuitive than that of the spearman @xmath1 . in this respect , it is important to point out that the average of the ranks is equal to @xmath6 , thus representing a measure of the sample size @xmath7 .",
    "it is of common knowledge that the pearson @xmath2 correlation coefficient is the most frequently used measure when data is supposed to be ( or is ) normally distributed .",
    "on the other hand , nonparametric methods such as spearman s rank - order and kendall s correlation coefficients are usually suggested to be better for non - normal data analysis .",
    "in fact , all three correlation coefficients are proportional to differently weighted averages of the concordance indicators .",
    "the normality constraint is briefly examined in an appendix , together with a discussion of the pearson coefficient interest in the present context .",
    "it is briefly argued that the kendall @xmath0 brings some information of interest .",
    "we consider that this is particularly so , when values are of different natures and are measured with a quite often unknown error bar .    in the field of economic geography ,",
    "the rank - rank analysis is quite neglected .",
    "a noteworthy exception is rappoport @xcite , where population densities and consumption amenities are compared and discussed for u.s .",
    "economical - demographical data .",
    "the paper of mori and smith @xcite is also of interest , in that it focuses on the link between economics and demography at a city level by investigating the number of cities inhabitants in presence of established industries .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the main text below is the first paper dealing with the application of this theory for discussing the relationship between ( italian ) demographical and economical reality .",
    "it is also important to note that the employment of microdata allows to emphasize italian regional disparities . in this respect ,",
    "we address the interested reader to de groot et al .",
    "@xcite and melo et al . @xcite . in short ,",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ 8092 ] contains the description of the data .",
    "section [ citydistributions ] is devoted to the analysis of the whole it .",
    "two measures , the kendall s @xmath0 and the spearman s @xmath1 rank correlation coefficients , are proposed and their respective interest discussed .",
    "the findings are collected and reworded in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "such section includes also subsection [ regionaldisparities ] , which serves to emphasize the regularities and disparities between the italian regions .",
    "thereafter , a specific modeling based on urn filling statistics , is presented in section [ model ] .",
    "it can be expected to hold when rank relationship features similar to those of our findings are observed .",
    "the last section ( section [ conclusions ] ) serves for conclusions and for offering suggestions for further research lines .",
    "there are three appendices : app .",
    "a contains a technical detail note on data aggregation , as already mentioned , arising from the change in the number of cities in italy during the ati measurements .",
    "b is a short investigation on the ( as also pointed here above ) negligible , in fact , time dependence .",
    "c contains a note on the pearson coefficient and some argument in favor of considering rank - rank correlations instead of value - value correlations .",
    "the population data comes from the 2011 census performed by the italian institute of statistics ( istat ) .",
    "the economic data has been obtained by and from the research center of the italian ministry of economics and finance .",
    "population data consist of number of inhabitants , while economic data are given by it gdp for recent five years ( 2007 - 2011 ) ( the aggregated tax income - ati ) . in both cases ,",
    "we have disaggregated contributions at a municipal level ( in it a _ municipality _ or _ city _ is denoted as _ comune _ , - plural @xmath8 ) . to provide",
    "some better understanding of the paper aims and results , the it administrative structure is here first described .",
    "it is composed of 20 regions , more than 100 provinces and more than 8000 municipalities .",
    "each municipality belongs to one and only one province ; each province is contained in one and only one region .",
    "administrative modifications due to the it political system has led to a varying number of provinces and municipalities during the examined quinquennium .",
    "the number of cities in each administrative entity has also changed , but the number of regions has been constantly equal to 20 .",
    "therefore , the available yearly ati data corresponds to a different number of cities . in particular",
    ", the number of cities has been yearly evolving respectively as follows : 8101 , 8094 , 8094 , 8092 , 8092 , - from 2007 till 2011 .",
    "details are given in appendix a.    the number of cities in each region is given as a function of time in table [ tablencityperregion ] .",
    "for making sense , it is necessary to compare identical lists .",
    "we have considered this latest 2011 `` count '' as the basic one .",
    "therefore , we have taken into account a virtual merging of cities , in the appropriate ( previous to 2011 ) years , according to it administrative law statements ( see also @xmath9 ) . in the same spirit , the ati of the resulting cities ( and regions )",
    "have been linearly adapted , as if these ati were existing before the merging or city phagocytosis .",
    "a summary of the statistical characteristics for the ati of all ( @xmath10 ) it cities in 2007 - 2011 is reported in table [ tablestat ] . for a statistical overview of the italian structure , at the regional level ,",
    "see table [ tablestatcityperregion ] .",
    "it is also worth noting that there is some change in the ati rank of a city as times goes by .",
    "care was taken that the arithmetics pertain to the same city , when a sum or average was made .",
    "for example , there are twice 3 cities with the same name in it ; we carefully distinguished them .",
    ".number @xmath7 of ( 8092 @xmath11 ) cities in 2011 , and in previous years , in the ( 20 ) it regions ; such a region ranking by city number corresponds to that illustrated in fig .",

    "<S> this paper explores the relationship between the inner economical structure of communities and their population distribution through a rank - rank analysis of official data , along statistical physics ideas within two techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the data is taken on italian cities . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is performed both at a global ( national ) and at a more local ( regional ) level in order to distinguish `` macro '' and `` micro '' aspects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the rank - size rule is found not to be a standard power law , as in many other studies , but a doubly decreasing power law . </S>",
    "<S> next , the kendall @xmath0 and the spearman @xmath1 rank correlation coefficients which measure pair concordance and the correlation between fluctuations in two rankings , respectively , - as a correlation function does in thermodynamics , are calculated for finding rank correlation ( if any ) between demography and wealth . </S>",
    "<S> results show non only global disparities for the whole ( country ) set , but also ( regional ) disparities , when comparing the number of cities in regions , the number of inhabitants in cities and that in regions , as well as when comparing the aggregated tax income of the cities and that of regions . </S>",
    "<S> different outliers are pointed out and justified . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , two classes of cities in the country and two classes of regions in the country are found . </S>",
    "<S> `` common sense '' social , political , and economic considerations sustain the findings . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the methods show that they allow to distinguish communities , very clearly , when specific criteria are numerically sound . </S>",
    "<S> a specific modeling for the findings is presented , i.e. for the doubly decreasing power law and the two phase system , based on statistics theory , e.g. , urn filling . </S>",
    "<S> the model ideas can be expected to hold when similar rank relationship features are observed in fields . </S>",
    "<S> it is emphasized that the analysis makes more sense than one through a pearson @xmath2 value - value correlation analysis .    _ </S>",
