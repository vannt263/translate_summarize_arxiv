    "this also explain the rarer , because nearer , grb - sn event as the april 1998 one , whose jet was off axis ( increasing its probability detection ) , but whose grb luminosity was extremely low .",
    "this beaming selection in wider cosmic volumes explains the puzzling evidence ( the amati - ghisellina law ) of harder and powerful grbs at higher and higher distances .",
    "this `` law '' is for isotropic fireball explosion , contrary to the opposite cosmic trend required by the hubble - friedmann law : the further the distances , the larger the redshifts and the softer the expected grb event . to make grb - sn in energy equipartition",
    "the jet must be very collimated @xmath3 ( fargion , salis 1995;fargion 1999 ; fargion , grossi 2005 ) ; because of the statistics between grb - sn rates , its jet decaying activity ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) must hold for long timescales , @xmath6 .",
    "similar issues arise from the surprising giant flare from the soft gamma repeater sgr 1806 - 20 that occurred on 2004 december 27 : if it has been radiated isotropically ( as assumed by the the magnetar model ) , most of ( if not all ) the magnetic energy stored in the neutron star ( ns ) should have been consumed at once . on the contrary we think that a thin collimated precessing jet @xmath7 , blazing on - axis , may be the source of such apparently ( the inverse of the solid beam angle @xmath3 ) huge bursts @xmath8 with a moderate ( x - pulsar , ss433 ) jet output power . in our model , the temporal evolution of the angle between the jet direction and the rotational axis of the ( ns ) can be expressed as @xmath9 , where + @xmath10 and + @xmath11 . where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the relativistic particles of the jet .",
    "the simplest way to produce the @xmath0 emission would be by ics of gevs electron pairs onto thermal infra - red photons .",
    "however also electromagnetic showering of pev electron pairs by synchrotron emission in galactic fields , ( @xmath12 from muon decay ) maybe the progenitor of the @xmath0 blazing jet .",
    "the same muons showering may occur in grb .",
    "in particular , muon bundles have the advantage to avoid the opacity and escape the dense grb - sn - isotropic radiation field ( fargion , grossi 2005 ) .",
    "however most of these ic pevs showering in grb - sn scenario degrades the electrons to tens gevs energy leading to @xmath0 jet by ics .",
    "here we propose also that the emission of sgrs is due to a primary hadronic jet producing ultra relativistic @xmath12 ( 1 - 10 pev ) from hundreds pev pions , @xmath13 , or eev neutron decay in flight : primary protons can be accelerated by the large magnetic field of the ns up to eev energy .",
    "the protons could emit directly soft gamma rays via synchrotron radiation with the galactic magnetic field ( @xmath14 kev ) , but the efficiency is poor because of the too long timescale of proton synchrotron interactions .",
    "photopion production must occur to produce the observed neutron excess , a process that also gives birth to neutral and charged pions .",
    "the energy of the thermal photons necessary to produce pions is @xmath15 gev@xmath16 = 0.2 ev for @xmath17 10@xmath18 ev .",
    "photopion production with ambient galactic ir photons ( @xmath19 ) is favoured compared to proton - proton collisions ( @xmath20)(medina - tanco , g.a . , &",
    "watson , a.a , 2001 ) . charged pions ( born with roughly a tenth of the original energy of the proton ) decay into muons and then into electrons with @xmath21 ev .    by interacting with the local galactic magnetic field",
    "such electrons lose energy via synchrotron radiation , @xmath22 , with a characteristic timescale @xmath23 .",
    "this mechanism would produce a few hundreds kev radiation as it is observed in the intense @xmath0-ray flare from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "the larmor radius is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the synchrotron interaction length and this may imply that the aperture of the jet is spread by the magnetic field , @xmath24 .",
    "in particular a thin ( @xmath25 @xmath26 ) precessing jet from a pulsar may naturally explain the negligible variation of the spin frequency @xmath27 after the giant flare ( @xmath28 hz ) .",
    "indeed it seems quite unlucky that a huge ( @xmath29 ) explosive event ( as the needed mini - fireball by a magnetar model ( duncan et all 1992 ) ) is not leaving trace in the rotational energy of the sgr 1806 - 20 , @xmath30 .",
    "the consequent fraction of energy lost after the flare must be severely bounded : @xmath31 .",
    "we foresee that if the role of nucleons as primaries of the soft gamma emission of sgr 1806 - 20 is correct , the giant flare might also be source of a prompt ( and possibly repeating ) @xmath0-induced shower ( made by @xmath0 photons from the decay of pev neutral pions ) that may have been detected by milagro in correspondence with the 2004 december 27 flare .",
    "we also expect that a rich component of the eev neutrons ( or protons from their decay ) might appear in the auger or hires detectors , in rough coincidence with this event . because of the delayed arrival time of protons , one should expect also a long and persistent uhecr afterglow .",
    "finally a signal of secondary muons at pev energies , induced by high energy neutrinos from the sgr , might occur in amanda . to conclude",
