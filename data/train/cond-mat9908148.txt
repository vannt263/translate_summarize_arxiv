    "for all alive organisms death is inexorable .",
    "if life is not abbreviated by disease , predation or accidents then death is preceded by senescence @xcite .",
    "senescence seems to be related to reproductive strategies and it starts after an individual reaches the fertile age .",
    "it can be a slow process for species which reproduce many times ( iteroparous ) or an abrupt process for species reproducing only once ( semelparous ) - the catastrophic senescence of the pacific salmon being a good example of the late .",
    "there are tree kinds of ageing theories : biochemical , evolutionary @xcite and telomeric @xcite .",
    "the biochemical invokes damages on dna , cells , tissues and organs .",
    "defective proteins are synthesized altering the normal course of metabolism .",
    "the presence of free radicals , i. e. , of unpaired highly reactive electrons , can cause death of the cells or may even lead to cancer . as a consequence ,",
    "such theories are today firmly connected to modern gerontology .",
    "biochemical theories predict that species with higher metabolism would have shorter lifetime .",
    "a criticism against this result arises when the lifetime of birds and mammals ( of the same size and under optimal conditions in captivity ) are compared .",
    "usually , birds live longer .",
    "even closely related organisms like bats and rodents with comparable sizes have very different lifetimes .",
    "such differences should be explained by the evolutionary theories of ageing . in the telomere hypothesis of senescence , replication of normal cells",
    "is accompanied by a telomeric shortening .",
    "this acts as a mitotic clock resulting in a permanent exit of the cell cycle .",
    "evolutionary theories of ageing are hypothetico - deductive in character , not inductive .",
    "they fall into two classes : the optimality theory and the mutational theory . in the optimality theory",
    "@xcite , fitness is maximized by increasing the survival and reproduction rate early in life at the expense of late , i. e. , it sees senescence as a necessary cost of processes beneficial to youth . on the other hand , the mutational theory @xcite explains senescence as a result of late - acting deleterious mutations , i. e. , that a greater mutation load on the last part of the life is less strongly selected .    in this paper , we obtain both analytical and numerical solutions for a simple age - structured population model . in this model , reproduction is asexual and the individuals are submitted to helpful or deleterious hereditary mutations .",
    "the number of offsprings is fixed but arbitrary otherwise and the population dynamics is managed by natural selection . amazingly , this system does not exhibit senescence even when deleterious mutations are predominant . from a mathematical point of view , the solution we found factorizes into a fertility and a mutational sectors .",
    "it is shown that the fertility sector is completely described by generalized forms of fibonacci sequences .",
    "on the other hand , the mutational sector , solved by fourier series , incorporates the combined effects of mutation and natural selection .",
    "if harmful mutation is intense then a mutational meltdown @xcite process can take place .",
    "all these results were corroborated by monte carlo simulations . from a biological point of view , our results make the model a good candidate to describe groups in which all reproduction occurs by fission , such as protozoa and a miscellany of coelenterates , since all them appear to lack ageing @xcite .",
    "consider a population distributed by @xmath0 ages @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) with respective birth rates @xmath3 .",
    "we call babies the individuals at age @xmath4",
    ". they do not reproduce , i. e. , @xmath5 .",
    "individuals with age @xmath6 die after reproduction .",
    "let @xmath7 be the number of individuals at age @xmath1 with survival probability @xmath8 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 at time @xmath10 ( of course , @xmath11 $ ] ) .",
    "we choose , as initial condition , an uniform distribution of babies , i. e. , @xmath12 with @xmath13 being a constant .",
    "let us point out that senescence here means that the average survival probability drops with age @xmath1 . at time @xmath10 ,",
    "each individual is submitted to mutation which changes its survival probability from @xmath8 to @xmath14 in the following way    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a random number chosen in the interval @xmath17 $ ] ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , generated by the uniform probability density distribution @xmath20 ( @xmath21 stands for the heaviside function ) . if @xmath22 then deleterious mutations are dominant .",
    "the transition probability @xmath23 , that an individual has its survival probability changed from @xmath8 to @xmath14 is given by the integral @xmath24 . observing that a helpful mutation is allowed as long as it does not increase the survival probability beyond unity",
    ", we get    @xmath25[h(j ) - h(j - e^{-b } ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + [ h(j'-j e^{-a } ) - h(j'-1)][h(j- e^{-b } ) - h(j-1 ) ] \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after mutation , all population passes through natural selection .",
    "the survivors then reproduce , generating babies with inherited characteristics , i. e. ,    @xmath26    at time step @xmath27 individuals get older or die . taking into account mutations and natural selection ( in this order ) ,",
    "their number is given by    @xmath28    clearly , @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath31 , equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) can be rewritten in the matricial form    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the following vector and matrix    @xmath36    matrix @xmath35 is a special form of the leslie matrices @xcite . iterating equation ( 5 ) we obtain at time @xmath37    @xmath38    where    @xmath39    and @xmath40 is the @xmath41 identity matrix .",
    "equation ( 6 ) shows that the dynamics factorizes into two sectors : the fertility , exclusively contained in the matrix @xmath35 , and the mutational , enclosing both mutations and natural selection processes and represented by the function @xmath42 .",
    "clearly , at time @xmath10 , we need only to know the first column elements of the @xmath43 power of the fertility matrix .",
    "as we shall see , these elements form a fibonacci sequence .",
    "let us call @xmath44 the element of the @xmath45 line and first column .",
    "it is a simple exercise to verify that if @xmath46 and @xmath47 then @xmath48 can be calculated , at any time @xmath10 , through the relation @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , which is exactly the fibonacci sequence!. the ratio of two sucessives numbers , @xmath51 , gives the golden section or the divine proportion as called by kepler .",
    "it is astonishing to find this ubiquitous sequence in so disparate things like the cluster - cluster aggregates @xcite , the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio , the pentagram star worn by the pythagoreans , the continued fractions , the aesthetic proportions of the parthenon at athens @xcite , and now , here , in population dynamics .    when the number of ages is 4 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 then @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( this sequence generates the so called tribonacci numbers ) .",
    "for an arbitrary number of ages and fecundity we have    @xmath57    the first @xmath58 numbers ( necessary to initialize the sequence above ) are evaluated through the identification @xmath59 , for @xmath60 .",
    "the numbers @xmath48 are determined , on the other hand , by using @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the expression above .",
    "recurrence formulas like equation ( 8) are _ generalized forms _ of the fibonacci sequence .",
    "these results , together with equation ( 6 ) , allow us to write down the number of individuals at time @xmath10 with age @xmath63 and survival probabibity @xmath8 ( we renamed @xmath64 )    @xmath65    the number of babies @xmath66 may be determined using equations ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) .",
    "the mean survival probability at any time @xmath10 and at arbitrary age @xmath1 can be calculated as    @xmath67    which is _ independent _ of @xmath1 , that is , the model _ does not show senescence ! _ .",
    "it is important to note that , although ageing is absent in our model ( in the sense that the mean survival probability does not depend on the age @xmath1 ) , an individual can show senile decay ( that is , its survival probability @xmath8 diminishes with time ) .",
    "this individual handicap is compensated by the natural selection of the fittest so , at a collective level , no senescence is observable .",
    "we also call attention to the fact that , in our model , the total number of individuals with age @xmath1 diminishes with @xmath1 .",
    "if we integrate @xmath7 over @xmath8 ( equation ( 9 ) ) , the ratio between two successives ages @xmath1 and @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 of the fibonacci sequence .",
    "this ratio depends on age @xmath1 only for small time @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the logarithm of this ratio corresponds to the so called mortality rate . for humans , the gompertz law @xcite suggests that mortality increases exponentially with age . in our model",
    "it is constant .    at a fixed age @xmath1 and survival probability @xmath8 ,",
    "the population increases with time at a rate given by @xmath70 .",
    "the first ratio of the right side can be easily calculated by the generalized fibonacci sequences , but the second requires a numerical analysis .",
    "the continous variable @xmath8 can be divided into @xmath71 intervals such that @xmath72 for @xmath73 and infinitesimal increment @xmath74 . for @xmath71",
    "big enough we expect to reobtain the continous limit . in the same way ,",
    "the products of @xmath75 in the equation ( 7 ) can be seen as simple matricial products .",
    "we wrote down a fortran program with extended precision to determine @xmath76 and @xmath77 at any elapsed time @xmath10 . for @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81",
    ", fig.1 shows the dependence of @xmath76 with @xmath8 at different instants . after a time @xmath82 we verified that    @xmath83    where @xmath84 depends on @xmath85 and @xmath86 but not on @xmath8",
    "this means that after enough time , the system reaches an asymptotic limit where @xmath87 , i. e. , there is a separation of variables and @xmath88 is a stationary solution .",
    "fixing @xmath89 and varying @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , we determine numerically that @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively . if , for example , we choose @xmath79 and @xmath96 for any @xmath1 then @xmath97 , and a malthusian exponential growth of the population @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively , is obtained .",
    "the last value shows that the system exhibits mutational meltdown @xcite ( extinction ) .",
    "the discretized form of the variable @xmath8 can also be used in order to calculate the mean survival probability @xmath101 ( equation ( 10 ) , dropping the now unnecessary lower index @xmath1 ) as a function of time .",
    "table 1 shows our results for @xmath102 . for fixed matrix dimension ,",
    "the time convergence is very fast .",
    "to check out all these features , we also made some simulations of the model .",
    "starting with an uniform distribution of the babies , we submit all of them to mutations as described in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "for each baby , a random number @xmath16 is generated in the computer and its new survival probability @xmath14 is calculated .",
    "then , playing the role of the natural selection , a random number @xmath103 is generated and compared with @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath104 then the baby becomes an individual of age @xmath105 and produces @xmath106 offsprings with inherited characteristics ( that is , with the same survival probability @xmath14 ) .",
    "as the process continues , care should be taken in order to avoid an explosion of the computer s memory . to this end",
    ", we limited the number of individuals by a random decimation .",
    "usually , in population dynamics simulations , this decimation is interpreted as a result of food restrictions @xcite .",
    "2 ( a ) shows that for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the final mean survival probability @xmath107 approaches @xmath108 in a very good agreement with our numerical results . for @xmath109 and @xmath81",
    "we find @xmath110 . the case @xmath111 ( fig.2 ( c ) ) leads to extinction , as it was predicted .    as another important check ,",
    "let us look at the euler - lotka equation @xcite which , for our model , reads    @xmath112    with @xmath103 being the malthusian growth exponent .",
    "substituting the simulated values @xmath113 and @xmath114 into the euler - lotka equation , we obtain the malthusian growth exponents @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively , which are in a fairly good agreement with those of our numerical prediction .",
    "incidentally , equations ( 11 ) and ( 7 ) can be consistently used to guide us to an analytical solution of the stationary @xmath88 .",
    "one can write the integral equation    @xmath117    integrating the right side and expanding the result in a fourier series , equation ( 13 ) turns out to be a set of linear equations for the fourier coefficients . in order to have non trivial solutions ,",
    "this set must have null determinant .",
    "the condition of zero determinant allow us to obtain the constant @xmath84 .",
    "for example , if @xmath80 and @xmath81 we find @xmath118 , in well accordance with the numerical results .",
    "the fourier coefficients have awful expressions so , to preserve the reader , we will not give them .",
    "let us discuss the relevance of our model by comparing it with others evolutionary models .",
    "the penna model is certainly the most intensively investigated @xcite .",
    "it exhibits ageing and sometimes catastrofic senescence .",
    "contrary to what happens in our case , in the penna model only babies are affected by mutations .",
    "moreover , mutation plays the role of a programmed death - individuals which have accumulated a number of mutations ( i. e. , number of 1 s in the bit - string ) larger than a threshold @xmath119 die . this fate can be anticipated only if the individual dies by food restrictions ( verhulst factor , which acts irrespective of individual fitness ) . in our model",
    "there is not such a threshold and individuals may live longer . besides that , natural selection here operates in a very hard ( and explicit ) way to eliminate those individuals which have suffered bad mutations .",
    "also exact solutions have been found for the penna model @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations involve directly the verhulst factor .",
    "we have similar equations ( ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) , but with the survival probability @xmath8 instead .",
    "amazingly , the leslie matrices were also found in the penna model but in a different context .",
    "there , the elements of these matrices are connected to the mutation rate while in our model they are associated to the birth rate .    as we said in the beginning , there are two kinds of evolutionary theories : optimal and mutational .",
    "our model belongs to the latter .",
    "the optimality theory is based on the fact that some genes have antagonistics effects , that is , they can be very beneficial early in life but deleterious late .",
    "for example , genes enhancing early survival by promoting a bone hardening might reduce later survival by promoting arterial hardening .",
    "these ideas were completely embodied by the partridge - barton model @xcite .",
    "further studies on this model , have incorporated somatic as well as hereditary mutations @xcite , leaving the model with two mechanisms of senescence : antagonistic pleiotropy and accumulation of bad mutations .",
    "but ageing ( due to mutations ) emerges in these works as a result of turning more intense with age ( in some artificial or arbitrary way ) the mutational strength .",
    "their procedures would be equivalent to assume , in our model , that the @xmath16 ( the mutational control parameter of eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) is a function of the age @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , this would also trigger an ageing process in our model .",
    "more interesting , however , is a different version of the partridge - barton model which is called vollmar - dasgupta @xcite model .",
    "it was generalized by heumann and htzel @xcite to support many age intervals . in this model ,",
    "each individual carries , like its genome , a whole set of _ independent _ survival probabilities @xmath120 where @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) is the _ actual _ survival probability at age @xmath1 .",
    "deleterious mutations can now affect any of them but only those coincident with the actual age @xmath1 will pass through natural selection .",
    "this means that most of the damage will only manifest later on .",
    "this accumulation of harmful mutations leads to senescence .",
    "our model differs from heumann and htzel only in the point that our individuals carry just one survival probability - that of its actual age .",
    "this is sufficient to change radically the results .    in summary , although containing all the relevant features of evolutionary systems like age - structure , advantageous or deleterious mutations , reproduction with inherited characteristics and natural selection , our model does not show senescence . in this way",
    ", it is a good candidate to a appropiately describe some coelenterates and prokaryotes groups , since all them appear to lack senescence . on the other hand , the beautiful analytical solution that we find and the techniques involved , encourage us to look forward new and more sophisticated models .",
