    "it has been known for some time that atoms can be trapped and manipulated by the gradient forces of light waves @xcite . however , for any two internal states of an atom , the stark shifts caused due to the trap light are different which affects the fidelity of the experiments @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite suggested a solution to this problem that the trapping laser can be tuned to wavelength ,  @xmath2 \" , where the differential ac stark shifts of the transition vanishes .",
    "knowledge of magic wavelengths is necessary in many areas of physics . in particular , these wavelengths have unavoidable application for atomic clocks and quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "for example , a major concern for the accuracy of optical lattice clocks is the ability to cancel the large light shifts created by the trapping potential of the lattice .",
    "similarly , for most of the quantum computational schemes , it is often desirable to optically trap the neutral atoms without affecting the internal energy - level spacing for the atoms .    over the years , there has been quite a large number of calculations of the magic wavelengths of alkali - metal atoms for linearly polarized traps @xcite , with rather fewer calculations of the magic wavelength for the circularly polarized traps .",
    "moreover , as stated in @xcite , the linearly polarized lattice scheme offers only a few cases in which the magic wavelengths are of experimental relevance .",
    "therefore , we would like to explore the idea of using the circularly polarized light . using",
    "the circularly polarized light may be advantageous owing to the dominant role played by vector polarizabilities in estimating the ac stark shifts @xcite .",
    "these polarizability contributions are absent in the linearly polarized light .",
    "recently , we had investigated the magic wavelengths for the circularly polarized light in rubidium ( rb ) atom and found spectacular results that can lead to state insensitive trapping of rb atoms using this light @xcite . in this paper , we aim at searching for magic wavelengths in the li , na , and k atoms due to circularly polarized light and also compare our results for linearly polarized light with other available results .",
    "the energy shift of any state @xmath3 of an atom placed in a frequency - dependent ac electric field @xmath4 , can be estimated from the time - independent perturbation theory at the second order perturbation level as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dynamic dipole polarizability of the atom in the @xmath7 state and can be expressed as @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the electric - dipole matrix element . in a more conventional form",
    ", the dipole polarizability @xmath10 can be decomposed into three components as @xmath11 which separates out the @xmath12 dependent and independent components .",
    "the @xmath12 independent parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are known as scalar , vector and tensor polarizabilities , respectively .",

    "in other words , the crossing between the two polarizabilities at various values of wavelengths will correspond to @xmath2 . as pointed out in the begining",
    ", it will be experimentally convenient to trap atoms at these wavelengths .",
    "the scalar , vector and tensor polarizabilities can be written using sum - over intermediate states as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 represents for scalar , vector and tensor polarizabilities and @xmath33 are their corresponding angular coefficients . in order to apply this formula , it is necessary to determine intermediate @xmath34 states explicitly .",
    "therefore , contributions from the intermediate states involving core orbitals can not be determined in this procedure . for a practical approach ,",
    "we divide contributions to @xmath35 as @xmath36 by expressing wave functions of the state @xmath3 as a closed core with the corresponding valence orbital so that @xmath37 and @xmath38 account contributions from the intermediate states involving core orbitals and @xmath39 take care of the contributions from the excited states involving the virtual orbitals . as a result , @xmath39 contributions will be the dominant ones among them and and can be estimated determining the important low - lying intermediate states explicitly .",
    "contributions from @xmath37 , @xmath38 and higher intermediate states with the virtual orbitals ( given as @xmath40 contributions ) are obtained using the third order many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt(3 ) method ) in the lewis - galgarno approach @xcite .    to determine contributions to @xmath39 from the low - lying intermediate states involving virtual orbitals , we express atomic wave functions of a given state with a colsed core and a valence orbital @xmath34",
