    "the non - linear schrdinger equation ( nls in the following ) is one of the better known effective models for several physical systems , from nonlinear optics to bec .",
    "one of its most interesting features is that it admits solitons , which in the focusing case ( the one studied here ) can be freely translating or pinned at definite sites when inhomogeneities are present . in the latter case they are usually called _ standing waves _ by analogy with the eigenstates of the linear schrdinger equation , and as in that case they have the form @xmath0 .",
    "the purely spatial profile @xmath1 is a nonlinear bound state solving the stationary nls and associated to the  frequency \" @xmath2 .",
    "solitons are a nonlinear phenomenon , and they often bear no apparent relation with the linear structures underlying the complete dynamics . nonetheless in many cases ,",
    "their appearance is strongly influenced by the spectrum of the linear dynamics . in the standard nls on the line or in higher dimension",
    "standing waves exist only when the frequency @xmath2 does not fall into the continuous spectrum of the linear part of the equation .",
    "the standard family of translating solitons on the line can be considered as bifurcating out of the edge of the continuous spectrum  in the semi - infinite gap \" .",
    "pinned solitons at a defect instead are typically the result of a bifurcation from isolated negative eigenvalues @xcite . standing waves with frequencies in the continuous spectrum of the linear part are not expected because the resonance with the continuous modes should prevent a balance between dispersion and focusing .",
    "this is usually the case , nonetheless in the late 90s it was shown , numerically and analytically that in some special models such _ embedded _ solitons exist .",
    "embedded solitons were then discovered in several models , related to higher derivative nls and kdv , thirring model , second harmonic generation system and others @xcite .",
    "various properties of embedded solitons have been investigated with numerical and partially analytical tools , but a theoretical framework seems to be lacking , as regards their existence , mechanism of generation and stability ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .    in the present paper",
    "we show that a rich soliton phenomenology , where all mechanisms quoted above are in action , arises in the _ standard _ cubic nls when the topology of the medium sustaining propagation is non trivial .",
    "nls propagation on networks is a growing subject especially due to experimental progresses in confinement of bose - einstein condensates in quasi - one - dimensional traps and engineering techniques of condensate wavefunctions to create solitons ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . until now",
    "the problem has been successfully considered at a theoretical level only in simple cases of y - junctions or h - junctions ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "notable exceptions are @xcite , where a mixed linear / nonlinear schrdinger system is considered numerically , showing interesting nonlinearity induced phenomena in particular regarding the appearance of strong resonances with possible applications to soliton propagation in optical fiber networks , and the recent @xcite where a first general analysis of existence and nonexistence of nls ground states on networks is given .",
    "the presently studied model is a cubic nls on a tadpole graph ( tg in the following ) , the simple structure obtained by attaching a half - line to a ring . for this model",
    "we give a complete classification of its nonlinear stationary states and bifurcations .",
    "the obtained results seem to be typical when an infinite system is coupled to a bounded one and therefore they point to a much wider range of application . in our model a denumerable continuous family of embedded solitons bifurcate from linear _ embedded _ eigenstates and a further family of edge solitons bifurcate from the zero energy resonance at the threshold of continuous spectrum ; moreover the former families display a secondary bifurcation with spontaneous symmetry breaking exactly at threshold .",
    "finally , other soliton families without linear analogue exist and are described as well",
    ". a primary signature of soliton bifurcations seems to be played by threshold resonances , i.e. , quasi - eigenstates bounded but not square integrable , of the linearized operators .",
    "this rich phenomenology strongly contrasts with the well known case of the standard nls on the line with or without external potential . on physical grounds",
    "this complexity can ultimately be traced back to the coupling between propagation on bounded regions , where periodic behavior is possible , and unbounded regions , where dispersion dominates but focusing nonlinearity allows soliton behavior .",
    "the model can be further enriched introducing an external physical control parameter given by a magnetic field acting on the head of the tg in the normal direction to its plane .",
    "the relevant fact is that the embedded solitons and their bifurcations from the edge survive in the presence of a topological constraint on the flux of the magnetic field .",
    "now we set up the model .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 $ ] the coordinate on the `` head '' of the tg and by @xmath4 the coordinate on the `` tail '' .",
    "the junction coincides with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , see fig .",
    "a function @xmath7 on tg has the first component on the head and the second on the tail .",
    "the scalar product in the @xmath8 space associated to the tg and the corresponding norm are naturally defined as @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "on this structure we consider the focusing nls for the function @xmath11    tadpole graph , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    @xmath12    where the hamiltonian @xmath13 is given by the selfadjoint operator : @xmath14 on the domain characterized by the so called free or kirchhoff boundary conditions at the junction @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the space of square integrable functions with two square integrable derivatives on each edge .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath13 describes a typical and simple _ quantum graph _",
    "@xcite with conservation of the probability flux at the junction . the nonlinear term @xmath17 is understood as a notation for @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the model can be rewritten as a system of two nls coupled by the boundary condition at the junction .",
    "the boundary conditions and are sometimes referred to as _",
    "boundary conditions and are the most commonly used in applications . the spectrum of @xmath13 is given by @xmath19 .",
    "a remarkable fact about the spectrum of @xmath13 is that @xmath20 , @xmath21 , are eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum with corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath22 notice that eigenfunctions corresponding to embedded eigenvalues are confined in a bounded region ( here the ring ) , a fact that is characteristic of quantum graphs ( see @xcite ) and can not occur in the simpler topologies of three or lower dimensional space .",
    "a second relevant fact is that @xmath13 has a threshold resonance , i.e. , there exists a function @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , which satisfies the conditions and and such that @xmath25 in distributional sense .",
    "the resonance function is the constant function @xmath26 .",
    "standing waves for eq . are solutions of the form @xmath27 , where purely spatial @xmath28 satisfies the stationary nls equation @xmath29 to compute the stationary solutions it will be convenient to rewrite the equation above componentwise .",
    "set @xmath30 , then eq . is equivalent to the system @xmath31\\\\ -&\\eta '' -|\\eta|^2\\eta = \\omega \\eta & & y\\in[0,\\infty)\\\\   & u(l)=u(-l)=\\eta(0 ) & & \\\\",

    "then we adjust the free parameters to match the boundary conditions .",
    "we start with the general solution on the tail . a non vanishing , and decaying at infinity solution of @xmath35 exists only for @xmath36 ; such a solution , _ up to translation and phase multiplication _ , is @xmath37 .",
    "next we find the general solution of @xmath38 on the head of the tg .",
    "since the domain is bounded , a qualitative phase plane analysis gives immediately that solutions can exist for every real @xmath2 and that one should distinguish positive , negative , and vanishing @xmath2 . to find their explicit form , one can skip the qualitative analysis and proceed directly to solve the stationary cubic equation by quadrature method . in this way it can be easily shown that the general solutions are given by jacobian elliptic functions ( see @xcite and @xcite for a study of nls on a ring ) , and it turns out that it is enough to consider two types of solutions ( selected among bounded and independent jacobian elliptic functions ) .",
    "the first type exists for @xmath32 and , _ up to translation and phase multiplication _ , is given by cnoidal type functions ( see @xcite ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 $ ] is a free parameter .",
    "the @xmath41 function oscillates between @xmath42 and @xmath43 and therefore the solution @xmath44 has nodes .",
    "these solutions have period @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the legendre s complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xcite @xmath47 we remark that for @xmath48 ( resp .",
    "@xmath49 ) @xmath50 and @xmath51 are defined only for @xmath52 ( resp .",

    "the period of @xmath60 is @xmath61 .",
    "+ now we fix the free parameters . a first family of @xmath41-stationary states denoted by @xmath62 vanishes on the tail .",
    "notice that this is the only possible choice for @xmath48 because with this limitation the nls on the tail has no square integrable solutions .",
    "we can choose @xmath63 such that the total length of the head is a multiple integer of the period of @xmath50 , see eq .",
    "below . translating @xmath50 of @xmath64 sets one of its nodes in the junction . then , taking @xmath65 , the kirchhoff b.c .",

    "notice the residual parity symmetry of the states @xmath62 : the head - component is an odd function w.r.t .",
    "to the point @xmath73 .",
    "the analysis of the behavior in @xmath63 of the function @xmath74 ( it is enough to understand its monotonicity and range ) leads to the following facts : eq . admits solutions for any @xmath75 if @xmath54 ; on the contrary , if @xmath76 it admits solutions only for @xmath77 such that @xmath78 .",
    "moreover we note that for @xmath36 we have @xmath79 $ ] while for @xmath76 we have @xmath80 .",
    "the constraint @xmath78 when @xmath76 is related to the fact that @xmath62 bifurcate from the vanishing state in correspondence of the embedded eigenvalues of the linear hamiltonian @xmath13 .",
    "if we set @xmath81 then as @xmath82 , using known expansion of near @xmath83 in , we find the asymptotics @xmath84 and finally @xmath85 although we have embedded eigenvalues , we recover the typical behavior of a bifurcation into a gap : the state @xmath62 bifurcates , as @xmath86 crosses ( in the decreasing direction ) the threshold value @xmath87 , from the empty state along the direction of the eigenvector @xmath88 corresponding to the embedded eigenvalue @xmath87 of the linear operator @xmath13 .",
    "next we discuss the case @xmath89 .",
    "we note that a power expansion in the necessary existence condition gives @xmath90 in this sense we have that for @xmath91 , @xmath92 for all @xmath21 , and the solution can be obtained by setting @xmath93 in the formula for @xmath50 .",
    "this gives @xmath94 then we have that for @xmath91 there exists an infinite family of stationary solutions labeled by @xmath21 and they are explicitly given by @xmath95 we conclude by noticing that the family @xmath62 contains an infinite number of stationary states for any @xmath96 .    for @xmath54 there can be other solutions of the problem with non - trivial behavior on the tail , necessarily of the form @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are free parameters that must be adjusted to satisfy the vertex conditions and .",
    "in fact two further families @xmath101 and @xmath102 with non - trivial behavior on the tail exist . after a straightforward analysis of the matching conditions one finds out that @xmath103 must equal zero and that @xmath63 must satisfy eq . .",
    "moreover , shifting the argument in @xmath50 to adjust the phase , one obtains the explicit solutions @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the smallest positive solution of @xmath106 see fig .",

    "as @xmath108 , we have @xmath109 and @xmath110 where @xmath111 are given in .",
    "notice that the bifurcation is symmetry breaking because due to the presence of the tail and the consequent shift , the head - component of @xmath112 lost the above recalled parity symmetry ; notice moreover that both @xmath62 and @xmath113 have exactly @xmath114 nodes .",
    "there are no other @xmath41-stationary states , in particular there are no @xmath41-stationary states when is not satisfied .",
    "+ now we discuss @xmath57-stationary states . in this case",
    "the tail - component has to be non vanishing since @xmath57 functions are separated from zero . so that solutions have the form @xmath115 , where @xmath116 , @xmath99 , and @xmath56 $ ] are free parameters that again have to be fixed to satisfy the boundary conditions and .",
    "imposing these matching conditions shows , after some lengthy analysis , that the parameter @xmath117 can assume only two values @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "for this reason we distinguish two families of @xmath57-solutions , both have non - vanishing component on the tail of the tg when @xmath54 .",
    "the first family has the following form @xmath120 for @xmath121 , and where @xmath122 are solutions ( arranged in decreasing order ) of the following equation @xmath123 and @xmath124 is determined , up to a sign , by the equation @xmath125 the sign is chosen as the same of @xmath126 .",
    "the first @xmath124 is positive , the following couple is negative , the next couple is positive and so on .",

    "[ fig3 ] has to be understood only on a qualitative level : in general @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",

    "although we have little information about this last family of standing waves , from the analysis of eqs . and , it turns out that , excluding the first one @xmath149 , they are generated in pairs in the following sense .",

    "@xmath154 as @xmath155 but @xmath156 and @xmath157 do not converge to 0 .",
    "the next couple of states exhibits the same behavior with a different threshold @xmath158 and so on . this is true also for the second family , for the states @xmath137 with @xmath159 , with a second set of thresholds @xmath160 .",
    "notice that the picture above is indicative of the bifurcations only , not of the behavior of @xmath161 .",
    "+ we now discuss some perspectives and future developments which can be stimulated by the above analysis .      in the present paper",
    "we do not tackle the problem of the linear or orbital stability of the standing waves and these subjects will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we only notice a related fact , as regard the variational properties of the standing waves .",

    "define the ground state of the system as the minimizer , if it exists , of the energy @xmath165 at fixed mass @xmath166 .",
    "it has been shown recently ( see @xcite ) that in a large class of networks with kirchhoff boundary conditions at the vertices and sustaining a nonlinear schrdinger dynamics a ground state does not exist .",
    "the tg does not belong to the class of graphs without ground state .",
    "we conjecture that for the tg the ground state exists and coincides with the first dn - state @xmath140 . if this were true a standard and well known consequence of energy minimization at constant mass would be the orbital stability of the state .",
    "another issue arisen by the previous analysis is the condition under which bifurcations occur , which again seems to display unconventional features .",
    "let @xmath167 be any solution of the stationary equation ( included the vanishing solution ) , and write @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are two real functions in the hilbert space @xmath8 .",
    "the linearization of the equation in a neighborhood of @xmath167 is described by the operator @xmath171 with @xmath172 and @xmath173 with same boundary conditions as @xmath13 . here",
    "the `` potential '' @xmath174 must be understood as follows : let @xmath175 and @xmath176 , then @xmath177 .",
    "we note that whenever @xmath167 is a stationary state one has that zero is an eigenvalue of @xmath178 and @xmath167 is the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "a commonly stated necessary condition for a bifurcation is that @xmath179 has an eigenvector with zero eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "this is certainly correct for the nls on the whole space , but has to be completed and generalized to encompass examples such as the present one .",
    "the generalization should include the role of threshold resonances and not only proper eigenvectors of the linearization .",
    "consider for example the above pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "for @xmath21 , the operator @xmath180 has no zero eigenvalues , but a zero energy resonance @xmath181 given by @xmath182 where @xmath183 was defined in eq . .",
    "analogously , considering the lower dn - state @xmath140 one easily recognizes for the linearization that @xmath184 , the original linear schrdinger operator on the tadpole .",
    "so both @xmath185 and @xmath186 have the same zero energy resonance as @xmath13 , and no kernel .",
    "therefore both in the pitchfork bifurcation and the bifurcation of edge solitons the kernel of the linearization is not the expected one ; instead , in the place of true eigenvectors appear zero energy resonances , which seem to represent an alternative signature of an ongoing bifurcation .",
    "now we consider a tadpole in an external constant magnetic field @xmath187 which we take orthogonal to the plane of the ring and acting only on the ring itself . in this case",
    "the flux is constant and given by @xmath188 and the component of the vector potential @xmath189 tangential to the ring is given by @xmath190 .",

    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between the set of standing waves for the problem without magnetic field and the set of standing waves for the problem with magnetic field .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath198 , @xmath201 is a standing wave for @xmath202 if and only if @xmath203 is a standing wave for @xmath204 .",
    "we note that , due to the phase factor in the boundary conditions , the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 which solve system are not necessarily real . after some analysis",
    "one can show that @xmath34 can be chosen real and that for real @xmath33 solutions exist only under the condition @xmath198 and they are the ones described above .",
    "the situation for genuinely complex solutions is more complicated and it will be studied in a complete way elsewhere .",
    "we just notice that posing @xmath205 one gets an equation for the `` one particle density '' @xmath206 solved by elliptic functions and the phase @xmath207 satisfies @xmath208 where @xmath46 is an integration constant ; moreover a set of boundary conditions hold for the one particle density and phase . among those ,",
    "there is a generalization of the flux quantization condition , which involves now the phase , @xmath209 .",
    "this is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have standing waves .",
    "so flux quantization or more generally phase quantization suggest that the magnetic field acts as a control parameter whose variation can induce sudden and discrete formation of nonlinear bound states .",
    "this poses the interesting problem of establishing which kind of solutions exist when one approaches the critical quantization values @xmath198 ( or more generally @xmath210 ) .",
    "it is to be noted that in the linear case the eigenvalues @xmath211 with odd @xmath77 are turned into resonance curves parametrized by the flux @xmath212 ( see @xcite ) , and so one would like to know if something similar to resonant states exists in the nonlinear regime .",
    "notice that the above considerations apply to more general nonlinearities than cubic , i.e. , every @xmath213 invariant nonlinearity of the kind @xmath214 .",
    "finally , different coupling at the vertex could be studied .",
    "for example one could consider some physical device which produces a perturbation at the vertex of attractive or repulsive kind . the easiest way to embody this effect is to modify the boundary condition introducing a delta potential at the vertex , which is modeled by the same continuity condition but has a different condition on the derivative , i.e. , @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is a real constant representing the `` strength '' of the delta potential .",
    "it is known that these boundary conditions result as a limit of a regular potential concentrated at the vertex when its support shrinks at the vertex itself . as for the case with kirchhoff boundary conditions ,",
    "@xmath217 are embedded eigenvalues with corresponding eigenfunctions given by @xmath88 , see eq . .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the additional @xmath216 term in the boundary conditions is ineffective when there is no tail .",
    "analogously , for the nonlinear problem , the cn - type solutions @xmath218 , having vanishing tail , persist as well . if the delta potential strength @xmath216 is negative ( attractive well in the junction ) , this generates a simple isolated negative eigenvalue in the linear problem . by standard bifurcation theory ( see @xcite ) , this will give rise to a new curve of nonlinear bound states related to the corresponding linear eigenvector .",
    "an open problem is the existence and characterization of other bound states and their relation with the linear problem . + to conclude , the classification of nonlinear bound states for the cubic nls on the tg exhibits a variety of behaviors previously unknown for standard nls with power nonlinearity on the line with or without inhomogeneities .",
    "moreover when an external magnetic field is introduced , an analogous scenario displays , when a quantization condition involving the magnetic flux holds true .",
    "this indicates the possibility of an experimental induction and control of long living states for this system .",
    "the analysis of nls equation on the simplest topologically non - trivial structure given by the tadpole graph could suggest that analogous phenomena could be present and studied in more complex networks .",

    "<S> in this paper we give the complete classification of solitons for a cubic nls equation on the simplest network with a non - trivial topology : the tadpole graph , i.e. a ring with a half - line attached to it and free boundary conditions at the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the model , although simple , exhibits a surprisingly rich behavior and in particular we show that it admits : 1 ) a denumerable family of continuous branches of embedded solitons bifurcating from linear eigenstates and threshold resonances of the system ; 2 ) a continuous branch of edge solitons displaying a pitchfork symmetry breaking bifurcation at the threshold of the continuous spectrum ; 3 ) a finite family of continuous branches of solitons without linear analogue . </S>",
    "<S> all the solutions are explicitly constructed in terms of elliptic jacobian functions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we show that families of nonlinear bound states of the above kind continue to exist in the presence of a uniform magnetic field orthogonal to the plane of the ring when a well definite flux quantization condition holds true . </S>",
    "<S> finally we highlight the role of resonances in the linearization as a signature of the occurrence of bifurcations of solitons from the continuous spectrum .    </S>",
