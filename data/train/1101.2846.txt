    "ultracold atomic fermi gases have been a very exciting , rapidly developing field , which has emerged within the past several years , bridging condensed matter and atomic , molecular and optical physics @xcite . using a feshbach resonance in a magnetic field , one can tune the effective pairing interaction strength between fermionic atoms from very weak to very strong @xcite .",
    "as the interaction strength varies , the nature of the low temperature superfluidity of these fermi gases evolves continuously from the bcs type in the weak coupling limit to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the strong pairing limit , exhibiting a bcs - bec crossover , which has been of great theoretical interest since 1960 s @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the unitary regime , where the @xmath0-wave scattering length diverges .",
    "this is a strongly correlated regime where no small parameter is available for perturbative expansions .",
    "it has been expected that this regime provides a prototype for studying both high @xmath1 superconductors and strongly interacting fermi gases which are also of interest to nuclear and astro - physicists .    in this paper , we first review experimental progress in atomic fermi gases , with an emphasis on recent radio frequency spectroscopy measurements . then we will present a pairing fluctuation theory compare with experiment . we show that this theory successfully explain experimental measurements .",
    "the first theoretical study of bcs - bec crossover dates back to 1960 s , although it did not get much attention until the seminal work of leggett in 1980 on bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the discovery of high tc superconductivity in 1986 gave a strong boost to the interest in bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the unusual pseudogap phenomena in the cuprate superconductors might have to do with bcs - bec crossover .",
    "experimental efforts in this area fell far behind , because it had been difficult to find a system where the attractive pairing interaction is tunable .",
    "thanks to the laser cooling and trapping technique in 1990 s , one is able to create `` artificial '' many - body systems of fermionic atoms in a laboratory .",
    "the existence of a feshbach resonance in these fermi gases makes it possible to tune the interaction strength .    for ease of control , the feshbach resonances for the two widely studied species , @xmath2li and @xmath3k , are both very wide .",
    "the interaction in both cases are of the short - range , @xmath0-wave type .",
    "they are often taken to be a contact potential in theoretical treatments .",
    "the first experimental realization of bcs - bec crossover was achieved in 2004 by jin and coworkers , @xcite and almost the same time by the grimm group @xcite and the ketterle group @xcite . due to the difficulty in tuning temperature @xmath4 , the fermi gases were either in the superfluid or normal state at given interaction strength ( or the magnetic detuning ) .",
    "continuous variation of the system as a function of temperature was first realized by the thomas group @xcite at unitarity . in collaboration with the theory group at chicago @xcite , thomas _",
    "et al _ @xcite observed for the first time continuous phase transition from the normal to superfluid state in a unitary @xmath2li gas .",
    "one could argue , of course , that the vortex measurement of the ketterle group provided the most definitive smoking gun for a superfluid state . @xcite    besides the interaction strength , another great tunability is population imbalance between the two fermionic species to be paired @xcite .",
    "it adds a whole new dimension to the phase diagram and makes the physics much richer .",
    "it also generates interest @xcite in possible observation of the larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) state @xcite . experimental work in population imbalanced fermi gases",
    "was pioneered by the hulet group @xcite and the ketterle group @xcite .",
    "experiment in the extreme population imbalanced limit by the ketterle group manifested @xcite the importance of hartree - like correlation effects besides bcs - type of pairing .    unlike an electron system",
    ", it has been difficult to measure the excitation gap in the fermi gas superfluid . among all experimental techniques , radio frequency ( rf )",
    "spectroscopy @xcite is arguably the most direct probe . using a tunable rf field to excite one of the two pairing atoms from a lower hyperfine state ( level 2 ) to a higher hyperfine level 3 which do not participate in pairing",
    ", a higher frequency will be needed if the atoms in level 2 are paired .",
    "such a frequency shift ( detuning ) provides a good measure of the excitation gap .",
    "previous measurement by grimm and coworkers @xcite , and later repeated by the ketterle group @xcite , was done in a momentum integrated fashion . at low @xmath4 ,",
    "the rf spectra displayed double - peak structure , with a sharp peak at zero detuning and a broad peak at positive detuning .",
    "this double - peak feature was nicely interpreted @xcite as transitions from unpaired atoms the trap edge ( corresponding to the sharp peak ) and from a distribution of paired atoms in the inner part of the trap ( broad peak ) .",
    "however , doubt was cast about the origin of the two peaks as to whether they reflect pairing of bound state effects @xcite or simply a result of trap inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "recently , attention was also drawn to final state effects both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "a big step in the rf technique was the recent momentum - resolved rf spectroscopy experiment in @xmath3k by the jin group @xcite .",
    "with momentum resolution , rf spectroscopy is equivalent to the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) for an electron system , in fact , it is cleaner than arpes in that arpes is only a two - dimensional probe , which is often plagued by the existence of surface states , surface contaminations , work function , and the complication of energy dispersion in the third dimension . in comparison , of course , the signal - to - noise ratio in a fermi gas experiment is much lower , as limited by the ( low ) total number of atoms in the gas .",
    "although the trap inhomogeneity adds complication to the interpretation of the spectrum . like arpes , momentum - resolved rf spectroscopy measures the fermion spectral function , @xmath5 , which is of central importance in characterizing the system .",
    "in this section , we now present a simple pairing fluctuation theory , which was first developed @xcite to explain the pseudogap phenomena in high tc superconductors .",
    "fermi gases in the presence of a feshbach resonance can be effectively described by a two - channel model @xcite .",
    "it has now been known that the closed - channel fraction @xcite is very small for both @xmath2li and @xmath3k , throughout the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "therefore , for these systems , a one - channel model is often used as a good approximation , given by the grand canonical hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the free atom dispersion . the difference between eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and its bcs counterpart is that bcs keeps only the @xmath8 term in the interactions .",
    "the inclusion of finite @xmath9 terms allows incoherent , finite momentum pairing . for clarity of presentation",
    ", we will take a contact potential , @xmath10 , and use a 4-momentum notation , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and set @xmath14 .",
    "population imbalance can be described by @xmath15 .",
    "however , here we will only present the equations for the case of equal spin mixture .",
    "generalization to population imbalance can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume that ( i ) the fermionic self energy @xmath16 has a pairing origin , ( ii ) pairs can be either condensed or fluctuating with a finite momentum , and ( iii ) condensed and noncondensed pairs do not mix at the level of @xmath4-matrix approximation .",
    "figure 1 shows diagrammatically the contributions to the self - energy , where the double ( red ) lines indicate finite momentum pairs and the dotted line indicates the condensate .",
    "the subscripts `` sc '' and `` pg '' stand for superfluid condensate and pseudogap contributions , respectively .    .",
    "the dotted and ( red ) double lines represent the condensate and finite momentum pairs , respectively.,width=307 ]    to tackle this problem , we use a green s function method .",
    "we derive the equations of motion for one- and two - particle green s functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which will involve higher order , three particle green s functions @xmath19 : @xmath20 \\sim g , g_2 $ ] , @xmath21 \\sim g , g_2 , g_3 $ ] .",
    "we then truncate the equations of motion at the level of @xmath19 , factorize @xmath19 into a sum of products of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and treat @xmath17 and @xmath18 on equal footing .",
    "for @xmath18 , we focus on the particle - particle channel , neglecting the particle - hole channel which normally only provides a chemical potential shift .",
    "we emphasize that _ it is the particle - particle channel that gives rise to superfluidity . _ after some lengthy but straightforward derivation , we obtain the self energy : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the ( pseudogap ) @xmath4-matrix , and @xmath24 is the pair susceptibility . here",
    "@xmath25 is the bare green s function .",
    "a detailed derivation of this result can be found in ref .",
    "note that the @xmath4-matrix is effectively a renormalized pairing interaction .",
    "it shares exactly the same pole structure as the two - particle green s function , @xmath18 . through a taylor expansion of its denominator",
    ", one can extract the pair dispersion : @xmath26 the superfluid instability is given by @xmath27 , which is the bec condition for pairs .",
    "note that @xmath28 involves a mix of bare and full green s functions .",
    "we emphasize that _ this is a natural consequence of the equation of motion technique _ since it involves the operator @xmath29 .",
    "_ it is this @xmath30 form of @xmath31 that leads back to the bcs - form of gap equation in the absence of finite momentum pairs . _",
    "we focus on the superfluid phase where @xmath32 diverges at @xmath33 . defining @xmath34",
    "we have @xmath35g_0(-k ) + \\delta \\sigma \\nonumber\\\\   & = & { } -\\delta_{pg}^2 g_0(-k ) + \\delta \\sigma .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] neglecting the residue term @xmath36 , @xmath37 takes the same form as @xmath38 .",
    "thus we have immediately the bcs form of total self energy , @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "this then leads to the bcs form of gap equation , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the quasiparticle dispersion . _ different from the bcs mean - field theory ,",
    "we emphasize that here @xmath43 contains contributions from both condensed and noncondensed pairs so that it in general does not vanish at @xmath1 . _",
    "note that the finite @xmath9 pairs are different from the order parameter collective modes ; the latter represent a coherent motion of the condensate .",
    "here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are loosely proportional to the density of condensed and noncondensed pairs , respectively .     as a function of @xmath46 in a trap , where @xmath47 is the noninteracting fermi momentum , and",

    "@xmath1 is determined by setting @xmath52 .",
    "typical behaviors of the gaps are shown in fig .",
    "to address fermi gases in a trap , we use the local density approximation , by replacing @xmath53 .",
    "then the number equation becomes @xmath54 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) we show the bcs - bec crossover behavior of @xmath1 in a trap . here",
    "@xmath46 parametrizes the interaction strength .",
    "the rf response can be derived using the linear response theory .",
    "the rf interaction is described by @xmath55 and the response kernel by @xmath56 we assume hyperfine level 3 was initially empty . in the absence of final state interactions , as in @xmath3k , we obtain @xcite the rf current @xmath57 in order to address @xmath58 properly , we need to include the lifetime effects of finite momentum pairs and add an incoherent term @xmath59 in ( and only in ) @xmath37 , reflecting the residue term @xmath36 which we drop in solving the set of equations , i.e. , @xmath60 while above @xmath1 the spectral function with a pseudogap constitute a double peak structure with suppressed spectral weight at the fermi level , below @xmath1 , there is a zero at @xmath61 .",
    "as @xmath62 increases with decreasing @xmath4 below @xmath1 , the spectral peaks sharpen rapidly .",
    "this is a phase coherence effect .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be estimated from experimental rf spectra .     for a unitary @xmath2li gas between theory ( curves ) and experiment ( symbols ) .",
    "also shown in ( b ) is comparison for the noninteracting energy . here",

    "@xmath65 is the noninteracting fermi energy.,title=\"fig:\",width=158 ]",
    "in fig .  3 , we compare between theory ( curves ) and experiment ( symbols ) ( a ) the density profile @xcite and ( b ) system energy @xcite for @xmath2li in the unitary limit .",
    "both experimental and theoretical density profiles are very smooth , in good agreement with each other .",
    "alternative theories predicts either a kink at the edge of the superfluid core or nonmonotonic radial and temperature dependence .",
    "the energy comparison also reveals a quantitative agreement .",
    "the fact that the unitary and noninteracting curves merge at @xmath66 manifests the presence of a pseudogap .",
    "it should be noted that _ there is no fitting parameter in our theoretical calculations .",
    "_    shown in fig .  4 is a comparison of the spectral intensity map as a function of @xmath67 and single - particle energy @xmath68 between experiment @xcite and theory @xcite for a unitary @xmath3k gas at a temperature slightly above @xmath1 .",
    "the white dashed curve is the experimentally extracted quasiparticle dispersion , whereas the solid curve is obtained theoretically following the experimental procedure .",
    "it is evident that theoretical and experimental results are rather close to each other .",
    "indeed , as @xmath4 decreases from above to below @xmath1 , the spectral intensity map evolves @xcite from an upward dispersing branch at high @xmath4 to a bifurcation around @xmath1 , and finally to a downward dispersing branch at @xmath69 .",
    "this result establishes the actual single particle dispersions which contribute to the rf current , revealing that the broad peak in previous momentum - integrated rf spectra @xcite indeed has a pairing origin .",
    "furthermore , it also shows that , despite the trap inhomogeneity , momentum resolved rf spectroscopy can still provide a quantitative measure of the spectral function and single particle dispersion .",
    "it also lends support for the present @xmath30 scheme since alternative nsr - based theories do not @xcite seem to generate the two - branch - like feature observed in ref .",
    "the downward dispersion around ( and above ) @xmath1 provides direct evidence for the existence of a pseudogap above @xmath1 at unitarity .",
    "our theory serves as a basis for momentum - resolved rf spectroscopy analysis .    in summary , we have presented a pairing fluctuation theory where finite momentum pairing plays a progressively more important role as the pairing strength increases , leading to a pseudogap in the single particle excitation spectrum .",
