    "collisionless merger remnants are dominated by box orbits at their centers and tube orbits in the outer parts .",
    "the total fraction of tube to box orbits increases with the mass ratio of the mergers ( * ? ? ?",

    "it has been shown by @xcite that gas accumulating at the center of merger remnants creates a steep cusp in the central potential well resulting in a more axisymmetric central shape of the remnants . at the same time",
    "the fraction of stars on box orbits is significantly reduced and tubes become the dominant orbit family .",
    "the most reasonable explanation for this behaviour is that systems with steep cusps in their potential can not sustain a large population of box orbits .",
    "one interesting consequence of the change of orbit populations is that the asymmetry of the losvd of the stars changes in a way that is consistent with observations making it a good dynamical tracer for the presence of gas during the merger ( * ? ? ?",
