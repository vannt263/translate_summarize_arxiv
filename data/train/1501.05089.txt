    "re - signing _ is to change the signs of all edges incident to a given set of vertices or , equivalently , edges of an edge - cut .",
    "two signatures are said to be equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a re - signing .",
    "a graph @xmath6 together with a set of signatures equivalent to @xmath9 is called a signed graph and is denoted by @xmath10 $ ] where @xmath9 is any member of the class of equivalent signatures .",

    "it follows that if a signed graph admits a homomorphism to a signed projective cube , it must be a consistent signed graph .",
    "such a mapping then becomes equivalent to a packing problem as the following theorem claims :    a consistent signed graph @xmath27 admits a homomorphism to @xmath26 if and only if the edges set of @xmath6 can be partitioned into @xmath25 disjoint sets each of which induces a signature equivalent to @xmath9 .",
    "the following conjecture , introduced in @xcite and @xcite ( also see @xcite ) is the focus of this work :    [ planarstoprojectivecubes ] given @xmath28 , every planar consistent signed graph of unbalanced - girth @xmath25 admits a homomorphism to @xmath26 .",
