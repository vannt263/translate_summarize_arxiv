    "one of the most reliable ways to extract predictions in the low - energy regime of strong interactions is the use of the chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "this technique , suggested in @xcite , was put on ground in @xcite and has been fully developed in chiral perturbation theory over the last 30 years . in the pion sector",
    "one finds strong evidence for the correctness and usefulness of chiral perturbation techniques .",
    "a further step consists on trying to extend this success into the strangeness sector .",
    "the decay @xmath4 is however not in good agreement with the experimental data , see for instance @xcite",
    ". there can be several sources for this discrepancy : _",
    "i ) _ the @xmath5 mixing may play a major role in @xmath6 decays .",
    "however it was shown that within the chiral framework these effects are small for the decay @xmath7 @xcite . _",
    "ii ) _ final state interactions are significant in this channel @xcite .",
    "_ iii ) _ the weight of the strange mass , suppressed by large - n@xmath8 arguments at next - to - leading order , can re - emerge via unconstrained higher - order counter - terms @xcite .",
    "most probably , as shown by the unitarization procedure of @xcite , is some interplay between all these issues the cause of the disagreement .",
    "our point of view evades a direct calculation in the strong sector and is instead based on the experimental data and chiral symmetry only .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by quark masses and electric charge .",
    "quark masses are ad hoc parameters in the theory and their determination remains one of the most challenging tasks . on the experimental side ,",
    "quark masses can not be measured directly due to confinement .",
    "one has to relate them to observables which are sensitive to the variation of their values and try to extract the latter from the measurement of these observables . in the low - energy regime of the theory , quark masses come always multiplied by the quark condensate and one can _ only _ determine quark mass ratios @xcite . limiting ourselves to the light - quark sector including strangeness ,",
    "these ratios are equal to one in the case of exact @xmath9 flavor symmetry . excluding strangeness , @xmath10 in the limit of exact @xmath11 isospin symmetry .",
    "therefore , deviation of the ratio @xmath12 from unity can be detected in processes sensitive to isospin symmetry break ing .",
    "this is the case in the decay @xmath13 which is given mainly by the difference @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:1 ]",
    "we give the analytic expression of the decay amplitude for the process @xmath15 to one - loop order in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) including electromagnetic corrections . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we derive a relation between the up and down quark mass difference and the strong part of the dalitz plot parameter .",
    "we also give the chpt prediction at one loop for the mass difference using data from the dalitz plot . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we use one - loop chpt calculation for the decay width and the experimental value for the latter to predict the mass difference .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] summarizes our method of extracting the mass difference from data only by relating the decay width to the dalitz plot while keeping the strong interaction correction as a free parameter . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we use our prediction for the mass difference to determine the size of the violation of dashen s theorem and up and do wn quark masses .",
    "consider the process @xmath16 with mandelstam invariants @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 this is a @xmath19-particle decay .",
    "observables depend on @xmath20 free variables .",
    "conservation of @xmath21-momentum reduces the number of free variables to @xmath22 .",
    "since we are dealing with bosons , absence of spin implies that in the rest frame of the decaying particle , the orientation of the momentum configuration ( the angles ) is irrelevant and hence @xmath19 variables are trivial .",

    "chiral power counting of the diagrams shows that the amplitude counts like @xmath39 or @xmath40 at tree level and @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 at one - loop level in the isospin limit and in the classic standard scheme , that is , @xmath44 . in the isospin breaking case ,",
    "additional terms arise from the two sources of isospin breaking , namely , the electric charge and the up and down quark mass difference . from the electromagnetic mass of the pion ,",
    "@xmath45 we see that @xmath46 counts as @xmath40 .",
    "it follows that the additional terms count like @xmath47 or @xmath14 at tree level , and , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , or @xmath54 at one - loop level . by naive dimensional analysis ,",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath50 terms are suppressed with respect to the others and henceforth will be neglected .",
    "the decay amplitude can be written by symmetry considerations as @xmath55 the @xmath24-channel amplitude can be casted in the following general form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an order parameter for chiral symmetry which is related to the quark condensate , @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the pion decay constant .",
    "all three corrections in ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) are separately ultraviolet finite . both of them , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "have been already considered in the literature , @xcite respectively .",
    "in addition to these we have included a small , with respect to the previous ones , term proportional to @xmath62 . for completeness ,",
    "we give the analytic expressions for the corrections in the appendix .",
    "the dalitz plot distribution is parameterized as @xmath63 with @xmath64 the center of the dalitz plot and @xmath65 a dimensionless parameter defined in terms of pion energies @xmath66 as @xmath67 and in terms of mandelstam variables like @xmath68 the experimental value of @xmath69 as quoted in the pdg @xcite is @xmath70 in order to conform to the experimental analysis , we expand the square of the amplitude around the center of the dalitz plot with the use of @xmath71 ^j\\mathcal{m}(s',t',u')\\right\\rbrace _ { s'=t'=u'=s_0}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then match with the parametrization ( [ eq : parametrization ] ) , obtaining the scale - independent expression @xmath72 even if we have obtained ( [ eq : formula ] ) at next - to - leading order is straightforward to convince oneself that its explicit form is maintained at all orders in the strong interaction and at first order in the electromagnetic one .",
    "note that the @xmath69 s are given by the second derivative of the corresponding @xmath73 s , up to normalization factors , evaluated at the center of the dalitz , @xmath74 although ( [ eq : formula ] ) expresses the up and down quark mass difference in terms of the electric charge @xmath75 , it does _ not _ provide the electromagnetic part of that difference .",
    "in fact , taking the limit of vanishing @xmath75 , both numerator and denominator in ( [ eq : formula ] ) tend to zero and one _ can not _ claim that @xmath76 implies @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , expression ( [ eq : formula ] ) relates up and down quark mass difference to the electric charge through an observable , namely , @xmath78 .    as a first step ,",
    "we obtain the analytic expressions for the @xmath79 s to first order in the chiral expansion . for compactness",
    ", we use the gell - mann  okubo mass formula , @xmath80 , and obtain the reduced expressions for the @xmath79 s given in the appendix .",
    "the main feature of these expressions is the independence on any low - energy constant .",
    "this can already be seen from the fact that the coefficients of the latter in the @xmath81 s are polynomials in meson masses and do not depend on mandelstam invariants .",
    "taking the second derivative with respect to these invariants gives a null contribution to the low - energy constants .",
    "the numerical values , at next - to - leading order , of the @xmath79 s are found to be @xmath82 for the strong piece , and @xmath83 for the electromagnetic ones .",
    "notice that ( [ eq : alpha - experimental ] ) is roughly a factor two bigger and of opposite sign of ( [ one ] ) . replacing the @xmath79 s by their values in ( [ eq : formula ] )",
    ", we obtain at one - loop order , @xmath84 as @xmath85 must be positive definite the previous expression leads to the conclusion that the up quark is heavier than the down quark .",
    "the situation does not improve when including higher - order corrections or rescattering effects in the final state ( see table 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover a @xmath86 correction to the value of ( [ one ] ) roughly translates in a @xmath87 correction to ( [ eq : difference - dalitz ] ) . a close inspection of ( [ eq : formula ] ) reveals that , disregarding @xmath88 , this inconsistency will always show up if @xmath89 is not bigger , in absolute value , than @xmath90 .",
    "notice that this is against _ all _ the findings in the literature tackling so far the strong sector .",
    "we shall attempt in the next sections a different approach using a parametrization of available experimental data .",
    "as in the preceding section , we can repeat a similar procedure for the total decay rate .",
    "the decay rate takes the following form @xmath91 where the @xmath92 s are obtained , up to a normalization factor , by integrating the @xmath81 s over the allowed kinematical region , @xmath93 the operator @xmath94 is defined as    @xmath95    the experimental value of the rate as obtained from the pdg is @xmath96 using for the amplitude ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) the born approximation we obtain , @xmath97 while using the next - to - leading expression the contributions are split as @xmath98 in the strong sector and @xmath99 in the electromagnetic one . replacing the @xmath100 s by their values in ( [ eq : width ] ) , solving for the quark mass difference and discarding the negative root we obtain from @xmath101 the next - to - leading order value @xmath102 which can be afflicted with sizable and unknown higher order contributions .",
    "hitherto we have followed two different paths to obtain @xmath0 , leading to incompatible results : _",
    "i ) _ first we calculated the @xmath73 s in ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) at one - loop in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "after we evaluated their second derivative at the center of the dalitz in order to obtain the @xmath69 s ( [ als ] ) .",
    "we matched the latter with the data coming from the dalitz and obtained for the quark mass difference the puzzling value ( [ eq : difference - dalitz ] ) . _",
    "ii ) _ as a second approach we integrated the very same expressions for the @xmath103 s over the physical region in order to obtain the @xmath100 s , ( [ eq : one][twoo ] ) .",
    "we matched the latter with the data coming from the decay width and obtained for the difference the value ( [ eq : difference - width ] ) .",
    "both results , ( [ eq : difference - dalitz ] ) and ( [ eq : difference - width ] ) are in disagreement .",
    "this observation is a sufficient motivation to seek for a determination of these quantities that is as model independent as possible .",
    "we shall therefore ignore the theoretical determinations concerning the strong interaction and provide a determination merely based on chiral symmetry and on a combination of data from the dalitz plot and the decay rate .",
    "the decay rate can be obtained by applying two equivalent methods : _",
    "i ) _ either integrating the full amplitude , expression ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) . _",
    "ii ) _ or one can instead integrate the parametrization for the amplitude ( [ eq : parametrization ] ) . by working out explicitly both approaches and matching them , one can relate the quark mass difference to the dalitz parameter in the strong sector , @xmath104 without resorting to any definite value for @xmath105 .",
    "in doing so , we avoid attempting to dig out the how to obtain the piece @xmath105 from first principles and we leave it as a free parameter .",
    "this is justified by comparing the relative size of the perturbative values for the @xmath81 s at next - to - leading order and the expectation of strong rescattering effects at higher order .    as a first step we find a relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for that purpose",
    "we integrate ( [ eq : parametrization ] ) over the whole dalitz to obtain the decay rate . using for @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath108 their experimental values given respectively by ( [ eq : alpha - experimental ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma - experimental ] ) we determine the distribution at the center @xmath109 > from the previous value and the expression of the distribution at the center ,    @xmath110    derived from ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) , we write @xmath106 in terms of @xmath107 .",
    "we shall make use of this relation latter in order to pull out @xmath106 in favor of @xmath107 .    for the last step",
    "we start from the definition of @xmath111 in terms of @xmath112 in ( [ eq : width ] ) . expanding the latter around the center of the dalitz and integrating we",
    "obtain a relation between @xmath111 , @xmath104 and @xmath113 , @xmath114 equating now the two expressions for @xmath111 we obtain a second ( independent ) relation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "solving for @xmath107 leads to the final expression @xmath115 with @xmath116}{\\hat{\\mathcal{f}}(s - s_0)^2}\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath117 } { \\hat{\\mathcal{f}}(s - s_0)^2}\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath118 at next - to - leading order in the chiral counting @xmath119 note that the preceding coefficients are low - energy - constant independent .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in their analytic expression , we integrate the real part of the @xmath81 s subtracted at the center of the dalitz , that is , @xmath120 .",
    "since the coefficients of the low - energy constants in the @xmath81 s have no kinematical dependence , the subtraction allows to get rid of the low - energy constants . in other terms , the origin of the errors in the @xmath121 s , which is also the case for the @xmath79 s , is purely experimental .",
    "we have now the two relations ( [ eq : formula ] ) and ( [ eq : relation ] ) with the two unknowns , @xmath107 and @xmath122 .",
    "the first relation comes from the dalitz alone .",
    "the second relation is a combination of data from both the dalitz and the width .",
    "the solution of the system , constraining the down quark to be heavier than the up quark , gives the following numbers @xmath123 if instead we use the recent data from kloe @xcite we find @xmath124 for the strong interaction dalitz parameter and @xmath125 for the quark mass difference .",
    "we consider the square mass difference @xmath126 , which can be split into two pieces @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "we have used the fact that the pion mass difference is essentially of electromagnetic origin @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic term in ( [ eq : splitting ] ) vanishes at leading chiral order by virtue of dashen s theorem @xcite but is subject to corrections from higher orders .",
    "these corrections are commonly known as the violation of dashen s theorem . in order to estimate the size of the violation we shall introduce the parameter @xmath129 defined by @xmath130 and rewrite the difference ( [ eq : splitting ] ) at next - to - leading order in the following ultraviolet finite form @xmath131 the origin of the different terms in ( [ deltm ] ) runs parallel to those of ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) : @xmath132 and @xmath133 where obtained already in @xcite , while the sub - leading @xmath134 term is new .",
    "numerically its contribution turns to be around @xmath135 corrections to the @xmath136 value depending on the strong low - energy constant set we use . at next - to - leading order their numerical values",
    "are given by @xmath137 but these are subject to the uncertainty in the low - energy constants , as is indeed mainly reflected in ( [ delemt ] ) . comparing ( [ deltm ] ) with ( [ eq : splitting ] ) and using the estimates ( [ firstdel][delemt ] ) we obtain , @xmath138 the central value can be considered moderate in front of other estimates @xcite although no solid conclusion can be obtained in view of the errors .",
    "an alternative , and more error free , approach consists on replacing in ( [ eq : splitting ] ) the total difference by physical masses , the strong piece by its one - loop value and deduce the value of the electromagnetic piece and , _ a fortiori _ , that of @xmath129 .",
    "we find @xmath139 notice that this value of @xmath129 contains , beside the violation of dashen s theorem , the effect of higher - order strong corrections which can be sizeable .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is defined by eq.([eq : condensate ] ) .",
    "we take for the pion decay constant and for the quark condensate in the chiral limit the unquenched lattice determination @xcite , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively .",
    "this leads to the value @xmath142 where the main source of error comes from @xmath143 . together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : difference ] ) , the preceding estimation leads to @xmath144 now we use for @xmath145 the lattice determination quoted in @xcite , namely , @xmath146 , and obtain @xmath147 both results are , within errors , in agreement with the more recent lattice results either using domain wall @xcite @xcite , improved wilson @xcite , twisted mass @xcite or staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "in this letter we have used chiral symmetry and data to obtain a consistent parametrization of the @xmath148 decay . from the theoretical side",
    "we have pointed out that the calculation of the strong interaction effects are the most probable source of disagreement with data .",
    "we therefore take this contribution as a free parameter rather than attempting to evaluate it .",
    "the electromagnetic contributions are instead small with respect to the strong ones and rather well understood .",
    "we incorporate them using chiral perturbation theory . combining the dalitz plot parametrization with data we obtained a relation between the strong interaction parameter @xmath149 and the quantity @xmath0 . following a similar procedure for the width we obtained a second relation between the same quantities . solving the system for both unknowns we obtained @xmath150 and @xmath1 . as a first application",
