    "we show below that this system may be viewed as a lie - poisson system on the dual of the symplectic lie algebra if @xmath14 invertible , in which case it is geodesic , and on the dual of a more general lie algebra on symmetric matrices for arbitrary @xmath14 .",
    "the system is bi - hamiltonian and is not in the mischenko - fomenko class of integrable ( geodesic ) rigid body systems ( @xcite ) . despite this",

    "we use the lax pair with parameter found in @xcite to find a class of integrals that we show are in involution using the bi - hamiltonian structure and the technique of @xcite .",
    "independence is proved directly since the method in @xcite does not apply to this system , even though the integrals are obtained from the casimirs with a shifted argument .",

    "we extend our analysis of the system to this case and study the poisson geometry of the dual of this lie algebra determining the generic leaves and the casimir functions of both poisson structures relative to which the system is bi - hamiltonian .",

    "there are three integrable cases of left invariant metrics for geodesic flow on so(4 ) : the metric used in @xcite ( which goes to the clebsch case by contraction to the euclidean group ) and two other cases that correspond to left invariant metrics that are not diagonal in the standard basis of @xmath18 .",
    "the first one is obtained from deformation of the classical lyapunov - steklov integrable case on @xmath20 by deforming the lie algebra @xmath21 to @xmath18 ; the integrability of the corresponding system is due to @xcite .",
    "the last case has a fourth quartic constant of the motion and is the genuinely new integrable geodesic case found by @xcite ; a @xmath22 lax pair for this system was given in @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that these two cases are not linearly equivalent .",
    "the rigid body metric used by @xcite is the only algebraic completely integrable case for a left invariant metric that is diagonal in the standard basis of @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the state of the art regarding these systems is contained in theorem 8.3 , page 270 , of @xcite : in a certain large class of metrics ( non - degenerate half - diagonal metrics with some weight homogeneity conditions ) these three cases are the only algebraically completely integrable geodesic flows . whether these three cases are the only algebraically completely integrable geodesic flows in the class of _ all _ left invariant metrics is still an open question .",
