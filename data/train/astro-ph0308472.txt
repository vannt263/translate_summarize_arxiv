    "the most conventional statistics in cosmology include the two - point correlation function in real space and the power spectrum in fourier space .",
    "they have been investigated both by numerous analytical and numerical methods and provided useful insights into the cosmological parameters and properties of the galaxy biasing among others mainly from the large - scale structure of the universe . the present universe , however , has much more complex structures , such as filaments , voids , and superclusters , which can not be fully described by the two - point statistics . therefore other statistics beyond the two - point statistics are desperately required for better understanding of the universe .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath9 of the density fluctuations , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the density field and @xmath12 is the spatial mean of the density field , is expressed in terms of the modulus @xmath13 and the phase @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15 the two - point statistics is defined in terms of the modulus alone , and thus the statistics of phases play complementary roles in characterizing the nature of the density field .",
    "especially , the correlation of phases among different fourier modes is a key ingredient in understanding the emergence of the non - gaussian signature from the primordial gaussian density field .",
    "in fact several statistics which carry the phase information have been already proposed in cosmology , including the void probability function @xcite , the genus statistics @xcite , the minkowski functionals @xcite . however , finding useful statistics of the fourier phase itself is difficult mainly due to the cyclic property of the phase .",
    "for example , the one - point phase distribution turns out to be essentially uniform even in a strongly non - gaussian field @xcite and then one can not extract any useful information out of it . for this reason",
    ", previous studies of the fourier phase have been mainly devoted to the evolution of phase shifts in individual modes @xcite ) , and the phase differences between the fourier modes @xcite .",
    "there is still , however , a very incomplete understanding of how phase correlations among different modes start to show up , or for the corresponding structure in real space that the strong phase correlation indicates .",
    "the connection between the higher - order statistics and the phase correlations has been also suggested @xcite .",
    "recently , one of the present authors obtained an analytic expression for the distribution function of the `` phase sum '' @xmath16 where the corresponding wavevectors satisfy @xmath17 ( matsubara 2003b ) .",
    "he discovered the general relation between the distribution of the phase sum and the hierarchy of polyspectra in the perturbation theory .",
    "following his analytic results , we extensively study the behavior of the distribution of the phase sum of triangle wavevectors using a series of cosmological @xmath2-body simulation .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we briefly review the analytic expansion formula of the phase correlations with particular emphasis to the sampling volume dependence on the distribution function of the phase sum .",
    "section 3 summarizes the simulation data and the computation method , and the results are shown in  4 .",
    "finally  5 is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "starting from the edgeworth - like expansion of the joint probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xcite of arbitrary sets of the modulus factor @xmath13 and the phase factor @xmath14 in the fourier mode @xmath4 , matsubara ( 2003b ) derived the joint pdf of phases among different fourier modes of arbitrary closed wavevectors after integrating over the other variables .",
    "the condition of the closed wavevectors ensures the translational invariance of the statistics . in the lowest order approximation , the joint pdf of the three phases in triangle wavevectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) in a sampling volume @xmath7",
    "is written @xcite as @xmath22 @xmath23 for any periodic distributions on @xmath24 $ ] , it is natural to expect that its lowest - order expansion gives a constant plus the cosine term .",
    "therefore the most important point in the above formula lies in the fact that the proportional factor @xmath25 is given by the cumulant defined in terms of the bispectrum @xmath26 and the power spectrum @xmath6 as follows : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ensemble average and @xmath29 denotes the kronecker delta which is @xmath30 only when @xmath31 .",
    "we use the convention of the fourier transform @xmath32 in a finite box - size @xmath33 .",
    "we explicitly write the volume dependence of @xmath25 , which is derived in appendix [ app : extensivity ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq : jointpdf ] ) implies that the pdf of the phase sum , @xmath34 , is written as @xmath35 we assume the statistical isotropy in the field distribution in the following analysis and thereby the distribution of the phase sum depends on @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in a fixed box - size @xmath7 .",
    "if the hierarchical clustering ansatz is valid , @xmath39 and thereby @xmath25 is approximately given by @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the lowest - order approximation ( eq.[[eq : matsubara ] ] ) breaks down at a scale @xmath3 satisfying the condition @xmath41 , which is different from the condition of the nonlinear clustering , @xmath42 .",
    "when @xmath7 is sufficiently large , the higher - order terms @xmath43 become negligible and equation ( [ eq : matsubara ] ) is applicable even in nonlinear regimes in the sense of the conventional cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "the unusual feature of the statistics of the phase sum is that the degree of the non - uniformity explicitly depends on the size of the sampling volume @xmath7 .",
    "this comes from the fact that the @xmath2th - order terms @xmath43 have different volume dependence , @xmath44 ( see appendix [ app : extensivity ] ) .",
    "therefore , the distribution of phases in an infinite volume is always random in a statistical sense .",
    "the concept of the phase distribution function is meaningful only when averaged over many subsamples of a fixed @xmath7 within the whole sample .",

    "these simulations employ @xmath57 particles in a cubic box with @xmath57 meshes and start from gaussian - random distribution with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the simulations were terminated at the scale factor @xmath60 when the r.m.s .",
    "mass fluctuation smoothed over the top - hat filter with the scale of one - tenth of a box - length reached unity .",
    "we use the scale - free models at different scale factors so as to study the evolution of the distribution of the phase sum .",

    "the model parameters of all above simulations are summarized in table [ tab : modelpara ] .",
    "we analyze three different realizations for almost all of scale - free models and cdm models to estimate the sample - to - sample variance . in order to study the box - size dependence of phase correlations",
    ", we consider the cdm data with different box - size @xmath62 of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , we divide the original box data based on all of scale - free models and cdm models with volume of @xmath64 into several sub - boxes with an equal volume @xmath7 : @xmath65 cubic boxes with a half length , and @xmath66 cubic boxes with a quarter length of the original box , as shown in table [ tab : boxsize ] .    the computation of the pdf of the phase sum proceeds as follows : first we construct the density fields defined on grid points using the cloud - in - cell interpolation from particle distribution , and then fourier - transform them into @xmath3-space .",
    "next we choose two wavevectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 whose absolute values and open angle are within a certain range . in what follows",
    ", we consider , for simplicity and definiteness , only the configuration of @xmath36 and @xmath37 whose absolute values are within the same range .",
    "finally we obtain three phases of the fourier modes for all sets of the chosen wavevectors , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 and then compute the distribution of the phase sum @xmath70 divided by the mean number per binned phase sum .",
    "we set a bin width of @xmath71 in @xmath72 range .",
    "we estimate @xmath25 in two ways ; one is based on a fit of the pdf of the phase sum to the analytic formula of equation ( [ eq : matsubara ] ) , and the other uses the direct definition ( eq.[[eq : p3 ] ] ) in terms of the power spectrum and the bispectrum averaged over the same range of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    throughout the paper the modulus of each wavevector",
    "is expressed in units of the nyquist wavenumber of the grid in each field unless the units of the scale are explicitly mentioned .",
    "for instance , @xmath73 $ ] implies that the two wavevectors satisfy @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "the nyquist wavenumber is defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of grids in a length of each box and @xmath78 is the length of the sampling box . in scale - free models ,",
    "we choose @xmath79 so as to fix @xmath80 as @xmath81 , where @xmath62 is the original simulation volume .",
    "we also confirm that the choice of @xmath77 does not change the results which we present in the next section .",
    "figure [ fig : phasesum_scalefree ] shows the time evolution , and the dependence on @xmath3 , @xmath38 and @xmath7 , of the distribution function of the phase sum ( symbols ) for scale - free models with power - law indices @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath48 , and @xmath59 . for comparison ,",
    "we plot with lines the lowest - order analytic formula ( eq.[[eq : matsubara ] ] ) with @xmath25 directly evaluated from power spectra and bi - spectra of simulations .",
    "we note that the poisson error of the distribution of the number of binned phase sum is very small .    the symbols in figure [ fig : p3_scalefree ] plot the cumulant @xmath25 as a function of the scale factor @xmath84 , the central value of the wavevector @xmath85 ( @xmath86 $ ] ) , @xmath38 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding lines indicate @xmath25 evaluated from a fit of the phase - sum distribution to the analytic formula of equation ( [ eq : matsubara ] ) .",
    "we choose the fitting range as @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] where the deviation from the lowest - order approximation is clearly seen .",
    "the quoted error - bars indicate the sample variance for @xmath82 model .",
    "figures [ fig : phasesum_scalefree ] and [ fig : p3_scalefree ] employ a fiducial set of parameters , @xmath89 , @xmath90 $ ] , @xmath91 $ ] , and @xmath92 , except for one parameter that is examined in each panel .",
    "the top panels in figure [ fig : phasesum_scalefree ] show the evolution of the pdf of the phase sum . in the earliest epochs ,",
    "the density fields are still close to gaussian and the pdf of the phase sum remains almost uniform . while the non - uniformity of the pdf develops at subsequent epochs , the upper - left panel in figure [ fig : p3_scalefree ] indicates that the lowest - order perturbation result well agrees with the simulation data even up to @xmath89 .",
    "the second - upper panels in figure [ fig : phasesum_scalefree ] show the scale dependence of the phase - sum pdf . again",
    "the overall agreement between the lowest - order perturbation theory and simulation data is very good .",
    "nevertheless only on large scales ( @xmath93 $ ] ) , the lowest - order approximation starts to become invalid ( see also the upper - right panel of fig.[fig : p3_scalefree ] ) .",
    "the fluctuations on large scales should be closer to the linear stage , and thus this behavior seems to be inconsistent with a naive expectation that non - gaussianity should show up first from small scales .",
    "this apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by the fact that the cumulant @xmath25 is approximately proportional to @xmath40 as we emphasized in  2 . in all the current data of the scale - free models , the nonlinearly evolved power spectra @xmath6 decrease with @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : power_scalefree ] ) .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath7 is fixed , @xmath25 is _ smaller for larger @xmath3 _ , and thus the lowest - order perturbation provides a better approximation .",
    "this is an interesting and unique feature of the phase sum statistics that we examine here .",
    "the second - lower panels in figure [ fig : phasesum_scalefree ] show the @xmath38 dependence of the phase - sum distribution .",
    "as indicated more clearly in the lower - left panel of figure [ fig : p3_scalefree ] , the value of @xmath25 , and thus the non - uniformity of the phase - sum pdf , increases slightly at @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 models .",
    "we suspect that this is ascribed to the presence of the large - scale filamentary structures in those models which the large @xmath38 ( therefore small @xmath97 ) in @xmath3-space may correspond to .",
    "the bottom panels in figure [ fig : phasesum_scalefree ] show the dependence on the sampling volume size @xmath7 .",
    "again unlike the conventional statistics , the pdf of the phase sum is indeed sensitive to the choice of @xmath7 .",
    "the lower - right panel of figure [ fig : p3_scalefree ] illustrates that @xmath98 is approximately constant implying the validity of the hierarchical clustering ansatz as discussed in  2 .",
    "this is why non - gaussian feature of the pdf becomes substantially stronger and the higher - order terms become more important as @xmath7 becomes smaller .",
    "figures [ fig : phasesum_cdm ] and [ fig : p3_cdm ] plot the same results as figures [ fig : phasesum_scalefree ] and [ fig : p3_scalefree ] but for the cdm models .",
    "the distribution of the phase sum is more uniform in scdm models compared with other models mainly due to the smaller value of @xmath99 ( table [ tab : modelpara ] ) .",
    "this is because the small @xmath99 corresponds to the small power @xmath6 with all over the scales and then @xmath100 has low value .",
    "the behavior of the parameter dependence is almost same as that in scale - free models .",
    "when a length of the simulation box is @xmath53mpc , the lowest order approximation well agrees with simulations for any cdm models , while the approximation becomes worse as the box length decreases .      as we emphasized over and over again , the pdf of the phase sum does depend on the size of the sampling volume . in order to understand the physical correspondence between the real - space distribution and the phase correlation",
    ", we compare the particle distribution from small sampling volumes on a sample - to - sample basis .",
    "first note that the non - uniformity of the phase sum arises from a few dominating density peaks in the sampling volume .",
    "consider a field which has just one spherical peak with a density profile @xmath101 located at @xmath102 .",
    "the density field in this idealized system is given by @xmath103 , and irrespective of the density profile of the peak , all the fourier phases are aligned to @xmath104 .",
    "thus the phase sum becomes zero in any combination of closed wavevectors .",
    "if another peak exists at a different position , the alignment of the phases is broken depending on the relative strength of the two peaks .",
    "if the peak height of the second peak is much smaller than that of the first , the phase alignment is almost preserved and the phase sum remains distributed around zero . on the other hand , if they have a comparable peak height , the phase alignment is significantly broken . in reality , all density peaks should contain substructure to some extent and many other structures in the field also contribute the eventual phase distribution .",
    "nevertheless the above qualitative picture proves to be useful in understanding the physical meaning of the phase sum distribution .    motivated by the above consideration , we examine in detail the connection between the particle distribution and the pdf of the phase sum .",
    "figure [ fig : field_vs_phase_25mpc ] plots the projected particle distribution and the corresponding pdf of the phase sum for 8 different samples of ( @xmath105mpc)@xmath54 box from one of the lcdm simulations of ( @xmath55mpc)@xmath54 box .    after smoothing the particle distribution over the gaussian window of @xmath106mpc radius ,",
    "we compute genus using contour 3d @xcite .",
    "then we define the peak heights of the 1st , 2nd and 3rd peaks , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 by the threshold density contrasts which the number of genus in the box changes from from @xmath83 to @xmath48 , from @xmath96 to @xmath83 and from @xmath110 to @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "those values are indicated in each panel of figure [ fig : field_vs_phase_25mpc ] .",
    "as expected from the above argument , figure [ fig : field_vs_phase_25mpc ] clearly shows that the degree of non - uniformity of the pdf is related to the presence of the dominating peak in the box ; the sample ( d ) has a single prominent density peak , and the phase sum is strongly distributed around zero , while the sample ( b ) has three almost comparable peaks resulting a fairly uniform pdf of the phase sum .    to be more quantitative , we compute @xmath25 and the ratio of the peak heights of the first and the second peaks for @xmath66 samples of @xmath111mpc)@xmath54 and @xmath65 samples of @xmath112mpc)@xmath54 , both constructed from one realization of lcdm model .",
    "the result plotted in figure [ fig : peakratio_vs_p3 ] indeed supports the strong correlation between the value of @xmath25 and the ratio of the peak heights .",
    "in fact , this naturally explains the dependence of the pdf on @xmath7 . as @xmath7 increases ,",
    "the number of density peaks in the sampling volume increases and those peaks tend to weaken the correlation of the phase sum .",
    "this clearly illustrated in figure [ fig : field_vs_phase_50mpc ] which plots the result for the box of @xmath113mpc)@xmath54 comprising all the eight samples of @xmath111mpc)@xmath54 plotted in figure [ fig : field_vs_phase_25mpc ] .",
    "we have performed a detailed numerical analysis of the phase correlation induced by nonlinear gravity in the universe . following recent analytic work by matsubara ( 2003b ) in perturbation theory ,",
    "we have computed the distribution function of the phase sum in triangle wavevectors and compared with his analytic formula . using a large set of @xmath2-body simulations",
    ", we have explored the behavior of phase correlations for various configurations of wavevector triangles in the fourier space at different epochs in a range of different sampling volumes .",
    "we find that the agreement of the simulations and the analytic perturbation formula is generally good .",
    "quite interestingly the series expansion of the analytic formula breaks down for @xmath114 , which is in marked contrast to the conventional linear / nonlinear criterion , @xmath115 .",
    "therefore the statistics of the phase sum indeed depends on the size of the sampling volume explicitly .",
    "this feature is naturally explained by the corresponding density structure in real space ; all the phases are synchronized with each other when a distinctive density peak dominates in the given sampling volume , while the phase correlations become weaker if several peaks with comparable heights exist .",
    "we have confirmed this expectation directly by comparing the strength of phase correlations with the ratio of the highest peak to the secondary peaks in the sampling volume .",
    "therefore the phase correlation becomes diluted as the sampling volume increases because statistically it accommodates a number of peaks with comparable heights .",
    "the fact that the perturbation formula well reproduces the numerical results indicates that the information from the phase sum distribution mainly comes from the normalized bispectrum amplitude @xmath25 .",
    "since one can evaluate the bispectrum directly and independently from the phase sum distribution , one might wonder if the phase sum statistics is simply equivalent to the more conventional bispectrum analysis .",
    "indeed the dependence on the sampling volume size may be a key in this context .",
    "this implies that any signal of non - gaussianity in the phase correlation disappears in the large - volume limit .",
    "we can repeat the analysis by systematically decreasing the sampling volume size .",
    "instead , one has to take an ensemble average of the phase correlations over many subsamples of a fixed @xmath7 to obtain proper statistical quantities . otherwise , the phase correlations in a single volume is much like the cosmic variance , as the sharpness of the highest peak is weakened in the limit @xmath116 .",
    "the situation is similar to the count - in - cells statistics , as the exact number of the galaxies in a single cell is attributed to the cosmic variance .",
    "taking an average of the weighted number in many cells gives a proper statistics , such as variance , skewness , kurtosis , and so forth .",
    "the average value and the sample variance with respect to the average as a function of @xmath7 may give additional information even beyond the bispectrum .",
    "the distribution of the phase sum may be applied to the real data of the existing galaxy catalogues including the 2df and sdss , which provides complementary information beyond the two - point statistics .",
    "since the phase sum statistics is a new concept in cosmology , we still need to explore many other aspects of the statistic that we are likely to have overlooked at this point .",
    "we are currently working on evaluating the phase - sum distributions of sloan digital sky survey galaxy samples considering all possible systematics by creating simulated mock samples as we did in the previous topological analysis ( hikage et al . 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "we hope to report the results elsewhere in near future .",
    "we deeply appreciate i. kayo and y. p. jing for kindly providing a large set of @xmath2-body simulation data .",
    "we thank k. yoshikawa for helping us improve our numerical analysis routines .",

    "<S> similarly if the sampling volume size @xmath7 is fixed , the stronger phase correlation emerges first at the wavevector where @xmath6 becomes largest , i.e. , _ in linear regimes according to the standard cosmological perturbation theory _ , while the distribution of the phase sum stays fairly uniform in nonlinear regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the above feature can be naturally understood from the corresponding density structures in real space as we discuss in detail . </S>"
