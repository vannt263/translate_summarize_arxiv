    "in a previous paper ( * ? ? ? * r14 hereafter ) we have described the novel combination of the ultraspec instrument installed at the 2.4-m thai national telescope ( tnt ) , and operated in drift mode to achieve fast imaging at the level of few milliseconds .",
    "this capability , entirely new for the given longitude range and at a telescope which is the largest in the southeast - asian region , has enabled a program of routine lunar occultation ( lo ) observations .",
    "the aim is to measure angular diameters , to detect and characterize circumstellar components , and to investigate binary or multiple stars .",
    "the achieved angular resolution is at the milliarcsecond level ( mas ) and the sensitivity @xmath2mag .",
    "this is currently the only routine program of its kind around the world .",
    "another large program was active at the eso very large telescope in the previous decade and produced a large number of results ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but was terminated with the decommissioning of the isaac instrument .",
    "only few observatories around the world remain suitably equipped to observe lo , and none of them has a comparable program in place .",
    "clearly , the high time resolution of this facility can be employed to observe other classes of objects as well , from cataclysmic variables to transits , and many kinds of transient phenomena .",
    "we report here on lo results recorded in the second tnt observing cycle , between december 2014 and may 2015 .",
    "the observations and the data analysis follow closely what was already described in r14 , and we provide here only a brief summary . an in - depth general description of ultraspec at tnt has been presented by @xcite . for lo",
    ", we use the so - called drift mode of the instrument , in which most of the detector is masked and light is recorded in two small square sub - windows .",
    "only one of the two is effectively used .",
    "this allows us to record uninterrupted continuous sequences , with typical sampling times around 6  ms and minimal overheads .    for the observations reported here , we have used standard sdss @xmath3 broad - band filters , as well as two narrow - band filters , r@xmath4 and n86 .",
    "they have central wavelengths of 6010 and 8611  and full - width half - maxima ( fwhm ) of 118 and 122  , respectively .",
    "narrow - band filters have the advantage of increasing the contrast of the diffraction fringes , as well of course of reducing the risk of saturation in case of strong lunar background .",
    "we typically record about 30s data around the predicted time of the event , to account for possible uncertainties , e.g. due to proper motions and limb deviations .",
    "the sub - windows can be further rebinned to improve the time resolution  see the parameters sub and reb in table  [ table : occlist ] .",
    "the result is a sequence of several thousand frames , which are converted to a fits cube and analyzed with specifically developed software ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a crucial step is to adopt an extraction mask tailored to measure only the pixels effectively exposed to the stellar light , thus greatly reducing the noise contribution from the general background .",
    "each frame is accurately time - stamped with sub - millisecond precision thanks to a dedicated gps signal .",
    "time - stamping is also relevant for other applications such as lunar limb profiling , which however we do not discuss here .",
    "note that we concern ourselves only with about 1s of data around the occultation event : the lo diffraction pattern extends in fact over 0.5s or less .",
    "this corresponds in practice to about 2@xmath5 on the sky .",
    "thus we are not sensitive to , e.g. , wide companions .",
    "we use two approaches to analyze the data : a model - independent maximum - likelihood method to derive the brightness profile of the source , and a model - dependent least - squares method to derive parameters such as angular diameters and binary separations @xcite .",
    "the software includes a number of features , e.g. to derive upper limits for unresolved sources or to model low - frequency scintillation .",
    "details are provided in the references above .",
    "the lo events are listed in chronological order in table  [ table : occlist ] , which follows the same format as r14 . in summary : d and r refer to disappearances and reappearances , respectively ; the magnitudes and spectra are quoted from simbad ; the filters were described in sect .",

    "as such , it was also included as possible binary in a catalog of bright multiple systems by @xcite .",
    "@xcite did not find evidence of changes in the radial velocity , using a statistical analysis that was however mostly sensitive to stars with parallax @xmath15mas .",
    "@xcite obtained speckle observations at a 4-m telescope , finding it unresolved with an upper limit of 30mas .",
    "interestingly , no lo event of this star was ever reported until now .",
    "we obtained a good quality ( s / n=61 ) , first ever lo light curve of @xmath0  psc .",
    "thanks to a relatively large contact angle , the efffective limb velocity was about 3 times slower than normal , leading to an increased sampling of the fringes which was crucial in assessing departures from a point source",

    "some constraint on the actual pa can be inferred from the upper limit on the separation by @xcite . assuming that their speckle measurements were sensitive to a companion with such a brightness ratio",
    ", the pa would have to be in the admittedly broad range 78@xmath16 to 210@xmath16 . assuming a combined 1m@xmath17 , a real separation between 1 and 2.6au ( converted from our measurement and from the speckle upper limit ) , a circular orbit and no inclination effects",
    ", the minimum period would be between 1 and 4 years . barring significant inclinations of the orbital plane on the sky",
    ", orbital motion might be detectable within relatively short periods of time , using i.e. adaptive optics at a very large telescope at visual wavelengths .",
    "this star is a late - type giant ( g8ii / iii ) and a bright near - infrared source ( irc  @xmath1120325 , @xmath18mag ) .",
    "no angular diameter measurements are present in the literature .",
    "@xcite obtained a lo light curve , finding the source unresolved .",
    "their data were recorded in the blue with a small telescope and were presumably noisy .",
    "another previous lo light curve is listed in the charm2 catalog @xcite , however the result was not published .",
    "estimated a diameter of 2.0mas .",
    "we recorded a high s / n reappearance light curve of hr  6196 .",
    "the data are best fitted by a resolved source model of 1.85mas diameter , which leads to a @xmath19 almost 2.5 times lower than for a point source .",
    "we also revisited the old data set mentioned in charm2 , which was obtained with an insb photometer in the @xmath20 band at the calar alto 1.2-m telescope on july 16 , 1997 .",
    "unfortunately , those data are affected by significant scintillation and only lead to an upper limit between 2.7 to 3.4mas , consistent with our result but not very constraining .",
    "this cool giant ( hr  3950 , irc  + 10224 ) has had a number of spectral classifications , with a general agreement around m2 .",
    "it has featured in many publications especially in the near - ir , where it has often been used as a calibrator source due to its brightness ( @xmath21mag ) and minimal variability .",
    "the angular diameter of @xmath1  leo has been repeatedly determined in the past , with results listed in the uniform @xmath22 , limb - darkened @xmath23 or fully - darkened @xmath24 disk hypothesis . using the npoi interferometer at various wavelengths with an average of 740 nm , @xcite reported @xmath25mas , in very good agreement with our own determination .",
    "a large number of lo observations also exist , with varying levels of data quality and accuracy .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath26mas in the @xmath27-band ( no error ) , while @xcite reported @xmath28mas in the blue .",
    "we note that in both cases a small sub - meter class telescope was used , so that scintillation may have played a role .",
    "a `` smoothing procedure '' was claimed as a possible cause for the first high value @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite reported @xmath29mas , while @xcite obtained @xmath30mas , both in narrow @xmath20-band filters .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath31mas , using a 1991 lo light curve obtained in h@xmath32 with a 1.3-m telescope .",

    "this is a bright m0 giant ( hr  4371 ) , especially luminous in the near - ir ( irc  + 00203 , @xmath34mag ) and included in many publications , some of which covering high - angular resolution . despite several attempts ,",
    "the star had remained until now essentially unresolved .",
    "these include speckle observations at a 4-m telescope with a stated upper limit of 35mas by @xcite and by @xcite , and a three - channel lo light curve from a 1.5-m telescope by .",
    "@xcite obtained a lo light curve which was consistent with a companion at a projected separation of 45mas and 0.8mag fainter .",
    "however , the data were obtained with a 40-cm telescope in an urban environment and the authors themselves cautioned about this finding . having a stable luminosity , the star has also been included in catalogs of spectrophotometric indirect diameter estimates .",
    "for example , @xcite quote @xmath35mas .",
    "our light curve for 75  leo has a formally very high s / n of 266 .",
    "in fact , the data were taken with a rather slow sampling ( and correspondingly long integration time , hence the high s / n value ) , due to passing clouds that made the star temporarily disappear during acquisition and forced us to observe in blind mode with an unusually large sub - window . as a result ,",
    "the diffraction fringes are smoothed and poorly sampled .",
    "nevertheless , these factors can be properly included in the data analysis and the @xmath19 clearly shows that the star is indeed resolved .",
    "our resulting angular diameter value is @xmath36mas , in excellent agreement with the estimate of @xcite .",
    "this represents the only direct determination for 75  leo . barring a very unfavorable combination of projection directions , the bright companion possibly claimed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who did not mention a pa for their event ) should have been seen in our data .",
    "this bright star ( hr  763 , sao 93022 ) has a spectral type f7v .",
    "being main sequence , it is as expected relatively nearby : its hipparcos parallax places it at 35pc .",
    "31  ari was first discovered to be binary from a lo by @xcite , with projected separation 21mas along pa=@xmath37 .",
    "the magnitude difference was found to be small both in the blue and in the red , prompting the authors to speculate similar spectral types .",
    "for comparison with our measurement ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:31ari ] ) , they quoted @xmath38",
    ".    following up on this , 31  ari was detected as binary using speckle by @xcite , and later reported in numerous other publications .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite computed orbital elements .",
    "they are however in considerable disagreement . using the latest , and presumably more complete , of the two we find that both older ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* epochs 1977.75 and 1984.07 ) and newer observations can not be reproduced .",
    "it is thus not surprising that also our measurement is at odds with the pa and separation predicted for epoch 2015.07 using the elements by @xcite .",
    "clearly , a reevaluation of all available measurements for 31  ari is needed .",
    "irc+20090 was found to have @xmath39mas by @xcite from a lo event in the near - ir .",
    "the s / n in our light curve is insufficient to measure the angular diameter .",
    "the two stars sao  96977 and sao  96978 are the components of the wide binary system ads  6146 .",
    "we recorded both lo events inside the same sub - window , about 5s apart , and we treated them separately . both were found to be unresolved .",
    "the bright star sao  98400 ( hr  3635 ) is an intriguing case .",
    "it was claimed as a possible double , seen in two colors simultaneously , by @xcite .",
    "they mentioned strong noise in their data and did not provide details about the separation , but they quoted a private communication from another observer who had also detected sao  98400 as binary . using speckle at a 4-m telescope , @xcite detected the companion with 89mas separation along pa@xmath40 . following that however , the source was not detected again by speckle in several attempts including with the russian 6-m telescope .",
    "the star is at just under 40pc distance and one could speculate a highly eccentric orbit which over the course of a few years brought the component below the diffraction limits of the telescopes employed .",
    "we note that our lo light curve had sufficient s / n and sampling rate to detect the companion if the projected separation had been @xmath41mas .    sao  96634 was reported as binary from visual micrometer observations by , with separation 71mas and pa@xmath42 , unchanged over nine years .",
    "the system was rediscovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* apparently unaware of couteau s work ) who recorded two lo events , each in two colors .",
    "the projected separations ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) however did not agree with couteau s results , and also not between themselves .",
    "finally , @xcite could not resolve the system by speckle observations at a 3.6-m telescope .",
    "our data are consistent with a companion with 60ms projected separation along pa@xmath45 , in approximate agreement with couteau s values .",
    "however , we do not list this among our binary detections because there is no significant @xmath19 improvement over a point - source model",
    ". the companion should be detectable by adaptive optics imaging .",
    "we reported the latest results from the program of routine lo observations at the 2.4-m thai national telescope .",
    "they include 4 angular diameters , three of which are first - time determinations , and two binary stars , of which one was not previously known .",
    "the angular diameters of @xmath0  psc , hr  6196 , @xmath1  leo and 75  leo are found to be in the range 2 to 4mas , with an average accuracy of 0.5% .",
    "thus , if combined with accurate bolometric fluxes , our results have the potential to constrain the effective temperatures to the 1% level , or less than 50k",
    ". concerning the binary stars , we detected companions with projected separations of about 4 and 12mas in 31  ari and @xmath0  psc , respectively .",
    "the magnitude differences ( in one case as high as 4mag ) could be measured to the 1% level .",
    "we also discussed those stars for which an angular diameter or a companion had been previously published , but which we found unresolved .",
    "the case of sao  98400 merits attention , as this binary was detected repeatedly in the 1980 s but not in the following decades .",
    "as stated in r14 , the tnt equipped with the ultraspec emccd fast imager can record lo light curves with few ms sampling times to about @xmath2mag at s / n=1 . for illustration , we computed future events taking the sao catalog as an approximate proxy for the sample of stars potentially reachable by lo at the tnt .",
    "after filtering for good circumstances ( sun and moon elevations , lunar phase ) , we find that over 500 lo events would be well observable during each dry season period .",
    "vsd and trm acknowledge the support of the royal society and the leverhulme trust for the operation of ultraspec at the tnt .",
    "this research made use of the simbad database , operated at the cds , strasbourg , france .",
