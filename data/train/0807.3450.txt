    "critical behavior of absorbing phase transitions can be categorized by universality classes @xcite .",
    "the most well - known example is the directed percolation ( dp ) class which may be ( loosely ) defined by a classification scheme known as the `` dp conjecture '' @xcite .",
    "the conjecture states that models exhibiting a continuous transition into a _ single _ absorbing state should belong to the dp class unless symmetry or conservation is involved .",
    "the dp conjecture is not complete in two folds .",
    "first , some models with infinitely many absorbing states such as the pair contact process  @xcite also belong to the dp class , at least in its stationary property , unless there is no clear - cut symmetry among absorbing states @xcite .",
    "second , the conjecture itself does not resolve the controversy related to the pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) @xcite .",
    "however , this conjecture is useful enough to trigger a search for a non - dp universality class .",
    "one can find several universality classes in ref .",
    "@xcite which do not meet the constraint of the dp conjecture . among them , this paper interests in the system with two equivalent absorbing states ( or in general two equivalent groups of many absorbing states ) @xcite . the ising - like @xmath3 symmetry between two absorbing states which is sometimes manifest as a modulo 2 conservation of domain walls in one dimension renders the system to exhibit a non - dp critical behavior .",
    "this universality class has several names such as the parity conserving @xcite , the directed ising ( di ) @xcite which will be used to refer to this class in this paper , the generalized voter class @xcite and so on . in higher dimensions ,",
    "all these classes become distinct .",
    "the ising symmetry ( or the modulo 2 conservation ) _ per se _ is not enough to force the di critical behavior .",
    "it requires an infinite dynamic barrier between two equivalent ( group of ) absorbing states @xcite , which is analogous to the free energy barrier between two ordered states in the equilibrium ising model .",
    "a state near one absorbing state can not evolve into the other absorbing state within a finite number of successive local changes .",
    "in other words , a domain wall ( frustration ) in a configuration generated by pasting two absorbing states can not disappear by itself , so the system never becomes absorbing with a single frustration @xcite .",
    "as an example without this additional feature , consider a one - dimensional system of diffusing particles with pair annihilation ( @xmath4 ) and branching of two particles by a triplet ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we may map this particle model onto the ferromagnetic ising spin model by interpreting a particle as a domain wall of the ising system as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) stands for a particle ( vacancy ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) represents a up ( down ) spin . clearly the number of domain walls is conserved modulo 2 and there are two absorbing states in the spin system ( all spins are up or down ) which are equivalent .",
    "however , the states with only one ( diffusing ) particle are also absorbing in the particle model . in the spin language , these extra absorbing states can be obtained by connecting two equivalent absorbing states ( for example , @xmath11 ) , which violate the infinite dynamic barrier requirement for the di universality class mentioned above  @xcite .",
    "it is numerically shown that this system shares the critical behavior with the dp not the di @xcite , while a similar system with @xmath4 and @xmath12 belongs to the pcpd class @xcite .",
    "it is claimed that a long - term memory plays a crucial role in differentiating these two universality classes @xcite .    according to the above criterion for the di class",
    ", one can conceive three possible routes along which the di critical behavior crosses over to the dp in one dimension . introducing a symmetry breaking field ( sb ) @xcite , allowing dynamics which breaks the modulo 2 conservation ( cb ) @xcite , or making channels connecting two equivalent absorbing states ( cc )",
    "@xcite drives the system into the dp class .",
    "but these three routes bring about different characteristics in the absorbing states .",
    "the sb route maintains the absorbing states but breaks the probabilistic balance between them .",
    "the cb route ( for example , by adding @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) invalidates the mapping between the spin and the particle model , and ends up with only one absorbing state ( vacuum ) .",
    "the cc route is accompanied by additional ( infinitely many ) absorbing states connecting two equivalent absorbing states with both the symmetry and the mapping sustained .",
    "to quantify the difference of these routes , we measure the crossover exponents governing the crossover behavior . in sec .",
    "[ section : models ] , one - dimensional models are introduced belonging to the di class . in sec .",
    "[ section : three ] , numerical results for the crossover exponents along three different routes are reported .",

    "we choose two di models for studying crossover from the di class to the dp class : branching annihilating walks with two offspring ( baw2 )  @xcite and the interacting monomer model ( i m ) which is a simplified version of the interacting monomer - monomer model  @xcite .",
    "we study the macroscopic absorbing phase transitions  @xcite inherent in the model .",
    "the suitable order parameters will be defined when we explain each model in detail . for convenience , the order parameter for different models will be denoted by @xmath15 throughout the paper .",
    "we only study one dimensional lattice systems with periodic boundary conditions .    for the simulation of the baw2 , we take the dynamic branching rule of ref .",
    "the simulation algorithm is detailed as follows : at first , we choose a particle residing at a lattice point randomly among , say , @xmath16 particles present at time @xmath17 .",
    "it may hop to a randomly chosen nearest neighbor site with probability @xmath18 .",

    "the i m is a lattice model with two possible states at each lattice point ; either vacant or occupied by a particle .",
    "the dynamics begins with the adsorption attempt at a randomly selected vacant site .",
    "when both of nearest neighbor ( nn ) sites are vacant , a monomer is adsorbed with rate @xmath25 . in case",
    "only one of the nn sites is occupied , the monomer is adsorbed on the substrate with rate @xmath26 , then reacts and leaves the substrate with the neighboring particle ( @xmath27 ) instantaneously . when both nn sites are already occupied , the adsorption attempt is rejected .",
    "the dynamics on the substrate can be summarized as    [ eq : alr ] @xmath28    where @xmath7 ( @xmath29 ) means the monomer occupied ( vacant ) site .",
    "the absorbing states of the i m are characterized by the `` antiferromagnetically ordered '' state ( @xmath30 ) and have the @xmath3 symmetry ( poisoning even or odd sites by monomers ) .",
    "starting with initial configurations without any @xmath31 pair , the proper order parameter @xmath15 is the density of @xmath32 pairs .",
    "the mapping of the dynamics of the i m to that of the contact process with the modulo 2 conservation [ cp(2 ) ] @xcite is possible , though there are some subtleties which make these two models a little bit different .",
    "if we assign a domain wall excitation , say @xmath33 , in the middle of the @xmath32 pair , the domain wall dynamics is exactly the same as the cp(2 ) rules .",
    "a pair annihilation in the cp(2 ) corresponds to an adsorption process of a monomer as in eq .   and a pair branching in the cp(2 ) to an annihilation process eq .  .",
    "note that the reaction always generates two domain walls ( two @xmath32 pairs ) , because an @xmath31 pair is not allowed in the i m .",
    "however , there is no one - to - one correspondence between configurations of the cp(2 ) and the i m , in general .",
    "for example , a domain wall configuration @xmath34 is not possible in the i m by definition , but possible in the cp(2 ) in principle .",
    "nevertheless , if we start with the fully occupied domain wall state , such a configuration can not be generated by dynamics and thus the mapping becomes exact . in this case , the parameter @xmath35 in ref .",

    "<S> scaling nature of absorbing critical phenomena is well understood for the directed percolation ( dp ) and the directed ising ( di ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , a full analysis of the crossover behavior is still lacking , which is of our interest in this study . there are three different routes from the di to the dp classes by introducing a symmetry breaking field ( sb ) , breaking a modulo 2 conservation ( cb ) , or making channels connecting two equivalent absorbing states ( cc ) </S>",
    "<S> . each route can be characterized by a crossover exponent , which is found numerically as @xmath0 ( sb ) , @xmath1 ( cb ) , and @xmath2 ( cc ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the sb and cb crossover can be understood easily in the domain wall language , while the cc crossover involves an additional critical singularity in the auxiliary field density with the memory effect to identify itself independent . </S>"
