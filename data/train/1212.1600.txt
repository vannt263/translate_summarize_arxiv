    "in 1992 , the results of a computer simulation study of the st2 model  @xcite of water were used to propose that a liquid - liquid phase transition ( llpt ) occurs in supercooled water  @xcite . below the critical temperature @xmath0 for the proposed llpt ,",

    "an appealing feature of the llpt proposal is that it simultaneously accounts for ( a ) the unusual thermodynamic behavior of liquid water in the supercooled region , and ( b ) the occurrence of two distinct forms of amorphous solid water in the glassy regime  @xcite .",
    "evidence for a llpt has been reported in a number of simulation studies of water and water - like systems ; see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "second , in both refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the method of ewald summation is used to approximate the long - range contributions to the electrostatic potential energy of the st2 system",
    ". however , liu et al .",
    "report that their ewald summation method employs vacuum boundary conditions , whereas limmer and chandler use conducting boundary conditions .",
    "liu et al .",
    "note some significant sensitivity in the behavior of their system as a function of these boundary condition choices .",
    "if and how these boundary conditions might affect the qualitative shape of the @xmath3 surface is incompletely understood .    in light of the conflicting results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , we present here a new evaluation of the free energy surface @xmath3 of st2 water . in order to expand our understanding of the role of long - range interactions , we use a different approach to account for the electrostatic energy , namely the reaction field method  @xcite",
    "indeed , many of the previous studies of st2 water that relate to the llpt hypothesis were conducted using the reaction field method  @xcite , including the work in which the occurrence of a llpt was first proposed  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a recent umbrella sampling mc study of the st2 model , using the reaction field method , showed that the shape of the free energy as a function of @xmath4 was consistent with the llpt hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "an explicit examination of the @xmath3 surface for the st2 model with a reaction field treatment of the electrostatics is therefore warranted .",
    "in addition , we also study a range of temperatures and pressures in the vicinity of the proposed critical point , to examine their influence on the @xmath3 surface .",
    "we study the st2 model of water proposed by stillinger and rahman  @xcite .",
    "the st2 pair potential is a sum of a lennard - jones ( lj ) interaction ( centered on the o atom ) , and electrostatic interactions involving four tetrahedrally positioned charges .",

    "@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the electrostatic interactions of the st2 model are evaluated directly up to @xmath22 using the original form given in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the use of a  switching function \" to preclude a divergence of the energy due to charge overlaps .",
    "the contribution of electrostatic interactions beyond @xmath23 is then approximated using the reaction field method , in which the liquid beyond @xmath23 is treated as a polarizable dielectric continuum .",

    "@xcite , we assume that the dielectric constant of the continuum liquid is @xmath24 . to avoid a sharp discontinuity in the electrostatic interactions at @xmath23 , a tapering function ( described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is used to smoothly reduce the electrostatic interaction between two molecules ( both direct and reaction field contributions ) to zero over the interval @xmath25 .",
    "the evaluation of the pair interactions as described above is the same procedure that was used in a number of previous studies  @xcite . for the remainder of this paper",

    "the maximum size of the attempted rototranslational and volume changes are chosen to give mc acceptance ratios in the range 25 - 40% , depending on the thermodynamic conditions .",
    "next , the change in the biasing potential @xmath45 is evaluated for the trial configuration resulting from the mini - trajectory , relative to the system configuration at the beginning of the mini - trajectory , to determine the acceptance or rejection of the trial configuration .",

    "the stability of both phases with respect to @xmath5 , highlighted in fig .",

    "we show the evolution of @xmath34 along a path in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane that approaches the vicinity of the predicted critical point in st2-rf .",
    "consistent with the occurrence of a line of first - order phase transitions terminating in a critical point , the two basins in @xmath34 are separated by a higher free energy barrier at lower @xmath1 , which decreases in height , and then disappears , on approach to the critical point .",

    ", our results for the structural relaxation times demonstrate that both basins correspond to equilibrated metastable liquid phases .",
    "these observations , and the dependence of the shape and position of the basins as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are entirely consistent with the occurrence of a llpt in the st2-rf model of water , as described in previous work  @xcite .",
    "our results are also consistent with those of liu and coworkers for the st2 model using an ewald treatment of the electrostatics  @xcite .",
    "our results are qualitatively different from the behavior of the st2 system reported by limmer and chandler  @xcite , and also are not consistent with their proposal that all the behavior previously ascribed to a llpt in water - like models is in fact associated with the liquid - to - crystal transition .",

    ".  @xcite , which shows the free energy surface upon which the above analysis of limmer and chandler is based . in this free energy surface ,",
    "the liquid basin is clearly distinct from the crystal basin , in the sense that any path connecting the minima of these two basins must pass over a barrier of at least @xmath93 .",
    "the shoulder in the free energy surface noted by limmer and chandler occurs deep inside the liquid basin ( near @xmath94  g/@xmath50 and @xmath95 ) , and is well separated from the barrier that defines the boundary between the liquid and crystal basins ( near @xmath96 ) .",
    "hence , any path leading from the shoulder to the crystal basin must go  uphill \" in free energy at some point along the path .",
    "the shoulder thus can not be understood as an extension of the crystal basin into the low-@xmath5 regime .",
    "when @xmath34 is plotted for different @xmath85 , the shoulder and the crystal minimum become superimposed on one another because they happen to occur at similar densities ; however , this is not a basis for concluding that these two features must be associated with the same ( crystalline ) free energy basin .    to conclude , we emphasize that not all models of water exhibit a llpt .",
    "for example , the mw model seems to be a case in which a llpt , which otherwise might occur , becomes unobservable due to the loss of stability of the supercooled liquid with respect to crystal nucleation  @xcite . whether or not a llpt occurs in a given water model , and indeed in real water itself ,",
    "may depend sensitively on the details of the intermolecular interaction . for real water , it remains for experiments to determine conclusively if a llpt can be observed , for example , by manipulating the rate of ice crystallization in the supercooled regime by exploiting nano - confinement or external fields .",
    "nonetheless , the results presented here provide clear evidence that a llpt does occur in simulations of the st2-rf model of water , and confirm the conclusions drawn in previous studies of this model regarding the existence of a llpt .",
