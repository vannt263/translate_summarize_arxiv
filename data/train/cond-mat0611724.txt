    "transition metal oxides constitute outstanding systems to explore strong correlations in solids .",
    "a rich variety of phase transitions and exotic electronic and magnetic ground states in this class of materials are at the focus of condensed matter physics.@xcite one system that has received considerable attention is vanadium dioxide ( vo@xmath0 ) that undergoes a first order metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at @xmath1 @xmath2 340 k between a high temperature rutile metallic state and a low temperature insulating state .",
    "the renewed interest in this particular oxide is , in part , due to unresolved roles of the structural transformation and of coulomb interactions in the mit.@xcite a better understanding of the metallic state is required to elucidate the nature of the mit .",
    "yet another remarkable property of vo@xmath0 pertains to the unconventional behavior of the resistivity for @xmath3.@xcite the electronic mean free path inferred from the resistivity data was nearly the same as the lattice constant , yet resistivity showed linear @xmath4 dependence without signs of saturation . in typical metals , the resistivity increases with increasing temperature but begins to saturate when the mean free path ( @xmath5 ) becomes comparable to the lattice constant ( @xmath6).@xcite ioffe and regel , and subsequently mott , have expressed the view that the electron mean free path can not be less than the lattice constant , and @xmath7 is commonly referred to as the ioffe - regel - mott ( irm ) limit.@xcite however , in certain exotic metals , including the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 and the high-@xmath1 superconductors , the resistivity continues to increase beyond the irm limit.@xcite a complete understanding of this behavior in these so - called ",
    "bad metals\"@xcite is lacking .",
    "more importantly , when @xmath8 , the conventional picture of a quasiparticle with a well - defined momentum undergoing occasional scattering events breaks down .",
    "such a regime can no longer be described by the boltzmann equation , signalling a breakdown of fermi liquid theory.@xcite fermi liquid theory has been remarkably successful in describing the electronic properties of typical metallic systems .",
    "understanding the deviations from this theory in exotic metals is a central theme of modern research.@xcite    significant progress has been made recently in the understanding of resistivity in the regime of short electronic mean free path .",
    "@xcite gunnarsson _",
    "et al . _ , in particular , have supplemented early qualitative discussion with numerical work , including the role of correlations.@xcite they devised a new criterion for resistivity saturation in correlated metals taking advantage of optical sum rules .",
    "the new criterion predicts saturation resistivities at values exceeding the irm limit and this is attributed to the reduction of electronic kinetic energy due to correlation effects .",
    "thus motivated , we have investigated the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 with infrared / optical spectroscopy over a wide frequency range and up to high temperatures .",
    "surprisingly , the optical conductivity shows typical metallic behavior beyond the irm limit with the drude peak centered at zero frequency persisting at high temperatures . in this work",
    ", we discover that beyond the irm limit , the linear increase of resistivity of vo@xmath0 with temperature is due to the linear increase of scattering rate of charge carriers .",
    "we show that although vo@xmath0 violates the irm criterion , the data is consistent with a higher value of saturation resistivity based on gunnarsson @xmath9 model.@xcite we conclude that electronic correlations , not electron - phonon interactions , dominate charge dynamics in the high temperature metallic phase of vo@xmath0 and that the correlated charge carriers are not conventional landau quasiparticles .",
    "vo@xmath0 films of thickness @xmath2 1000   were grown on al@xmath0o@xmath10 ( sapphire ) substrates with the sol - gel method .",
    "x - ray diffraction shows that the films are single phase vo@xmath0 . the resistivity decreases by four orders of magnitude upon entering the metallic state above @xmath1 @xmath2 340 k. the details of film growth and characterization are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the optical constants were obtained directly from a combination of ellipsometric measurements in the spectral range 50 mev - 5.5 ev and near - normal incidence reflectance data in the spectral range 6 mev - 90 mev.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ sigma1 ] , we display the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath11 below and above @xmath1 .",
    "vo@xmath0 shows a band - gap of @xmath2 0.6 ev with a clear threshold in @xmath11 in the insulating state ( @xmath4 = 295 k ) .",
    "the band gap value is in accord with previous data,@xcite and the presence of a clear threshold confirms the good quality of sol - gel grown vo@xmath0 films .",
    "three distinct peaks at 1.4 ev , 2.5 ev and 3.4 ev that arise from inter - band transitions can be discerned in the insulating state .",
    "there is significant rearrangement of the spectrum as vo@xmath0 enters the metallic regime ( @xmath4 = 360 k ) .",
    "a rather broad drude - like peak emerges at low energies and signifies metallic behavior .",
    "there is a shift of spectral weight from the inter - band transitions at 2.5 ev and 3.4 ev to the drude peak .",
    "the difference in the conductivity of the two phases extends beyond the upper cut - off of our measurements at 5.5 ev .",
    "similar broad energy scales are involved in the redistribution of spectral weight between the insulating and metallic states in other correlated electron materials@xcite including a close counterpart v@xmath0o@xmath10.@xcite therefore , data in fig.1 indicates the presence of electronic correlations in vo@xmath0 .",
    "a more quantitative approach to assess the importance of correlations is through their effect on the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons .",
    "if electron - electron interactions are important , then the measured kinetic energy is expected to be substantially reduced from the value given by band theory.@xcite this has indeed been observed in both the hole - doped and electron - doped cuprates.@xcite the optical conductivity provides us the means to obtain the expectation value of the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons in a solid through the partial sum rule:@xcite    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 is the plasma frequency , @xmath6 is the lattice constant , @xmath14 is the volume of a unit cell , @xmath15 is the number of unit cells and @xmath16 is the expectation value of the kinetic - energy operator .",
    "thus the expectation value of the kinetic energy is simply proportional to the square of the plasma frequency @xmath13 .",
    "we obtain the plasma frequency by integrating the area under the intra - band drude part of the conductivity up to a cutoff ( @xmath17 ) determined by the minimum in the conductivity at 1.7 ev and find @xmath13 = 2.75 ev .",
    "the square of this value is only fifty percent of that obtained from band theory calculations.@xcite this result is not particularly sensitive to the choice of the cutoff and confirms the importance of correlations in the conducting state of vo@xmath0 .",
    "we investigate further the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 at elevated temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ sigmat]a , we display the frequency dependence of @xmath11 in the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 for successively increasing temperatures",
    ". the conductivity decreases with increasing temperature as coherent spectral weight is transferred above 0.6 ev . however , the conductivity retains the drude - like shape even at the highest temperature attained . in fig.[sigmat]b",
    "we plot the  optical \" resistivity @xmath18 .",
    "the resistivity continues to increase almost linearly with temperature up to the upper limit of our measurements at @xmath4 = 550 k without any sign of saturation .",
    "this is consistent with lack of saturation seen in @xmath19 resistivity measurements.@xcite    next , we perform an extended drude analysis to obtain the frequency and temperature dependence of the effective scattering rate ( 1/@xmath20 ) and mass enhancement factor ( @xmath21 ) of the charge carriers.@xcite these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ xtendeddrude]a , b .",
    "@xmath22    in the above equations , @xmath23 is the imaginary part of the conductivity and @xmath24 is the band mass of the charge carriers .",
    "we find that the scattering rate ( in the zero frequency limit ) increases linearly with temperature and thereby leads to the corresponding increase of resistivity ( see fig .",
    "[ sigmat]b and inset ) .",
    "the absolute value of the scattering rate at all measured temperatures and infrared frequencies is higher than the excitation energy ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the canonical criterion for well - defined quasi - particles is that @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28.@xcite the scattering rate in vo@xmath0 certainly violates this criterion in common with the high @xmath1 cuprates.@xcite p. b. allen has defined the criterion for the validity of the boltzmann equation and fermi liquid theory as @xmath29 ( or @xmath30 ) where @xmath31 is the fermi energy and @xmath32 is the density of states at the fermi level.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ xtendeddrude]a , we see that @xmath33 0.5 ev which is comparable to @xmath31 @xmath2 0.5 ev.@xcite alternatively , taking @xmath32= 4.16/ev molecule,@xcite we find that @xmath34 is of order unity . hence , charge carriers in metallic vo@xmath0 are not well - defined quasiparticles .    in fig .",
    "[ xtendeddrude]b we see that the mass enhancement at @xmath4=360 k is a strong function of frequency .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath21 becomes weaker at higher temperatures .",
    "also , @xmath21 in the low frequency limit increases significantly with decreasing temperature i.e. as one approaches the insulating state .",
    "mass enhancement has been predicted in a strongly correlated electron gas in the vicinity of a transition to the mott insulator.@xcite in vo@xmath0 , the absolute value of @xmath21 is modest at @xmath4=360 k consistent with recent photoemission results.@xcite the increase in @xmath21 with temperature on approaching the insulating state is nevertheless significant and provides evidence for correlations in vo@xmath0 .",
    "however , the mass enhancement is not as spectacular as seen with doping in sr@xmath35la@xmath36tio@xmath37 , a classic system that exhibits a mass - diverging - type mott transition.@xcite several correlated systems are known to avoid mass - divergence near the mit.@xcite    we now investigate the metallic behavior of vo@xmath0 in light of the irm criterion . at high temperatures ,",
    "the resistivity of typical metals and alloys saturates at values which give mean free paths ( @xmath5 ) of the quasi - particles that are comparable to the lattice spacing ( @xmath6).@xcite a complementary viewpoint is that resistivity saturates when @xmath5 becomes comparable to the de broglie wavelength @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the fermi momentum).@xcite the real part of the optical conductivity in the dc limit @xmath41 ( fig .  [ sigma1 ] ) can be used to estimate the mean free path of the electrons in the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 from the equation @xmath42.@xcite here , @xmath43 is the @xmath19 resistivity ( @xmath44 ) ) . since a single @xmath6-electron per vanadium atom is delocalized,@xcite one obtains @xmath45 10@xmath46 @xmath47 assuming a spherical fermi surface for simplicity .",
    "thus , the mean free path is @xmath2 2.8   at @xmath4 = 360 k i.e. @xmath5 is nearly equal to the lattice spacing ( 2.85  ) and less than @xmath38 ( @xmath2 6 ).@xcite therefore , the bloch - boltzmann transport model no longer applies and the quasiparticle concept breaks down .",
    "it is observed that departure from the boltzmann transport theory typically occurs for @xmath48   in metals.@xcite if vo@xmath0 were to avoid breakdown of boltzmann transport through resistivity saturation similar to common metals , then saturation is expected to occur already at @xmath4 = 360 k ( fig .  [ sigmat]b ) .",
    "instead , resistivity increases continuously beyond the irm limit .",
    "it has been argued that a quantum theory of electrons which also includes correlation effects is required to give a correct account of resistivity behavior at short values of the electronic mean free path.@xcite within this theoretical framework , the optical conductivity of a correlated metal provides important insights into saturation phenomena .",
    "the low energy response of correlated metals at reduced temperatures often reveals a drude - like mode at far - ir frequencies attributable to well - defined charge carriers followed by a broad , incoherent part at higher energies . with increasing @xmath4 ,",
    "the coherent drude weight is transferred to the incoherent part.@xcite resistivity saturation is expected to occur when there is no further coherent spectral weight to be shed and only the incoherent part remains . in this model",
    ", the limiting @xmath19 conductivity @xmath49(0 ) of the incoherent part ( corresponding to resistivity saturation ) can be estimated from the @xmath50-sum rule :    @xmath51    here @xmath52 is the one - particle bandwidth and @xmath53 is a weighting factor ( @xmath2 2 ) depending upon the shape of the incoherent part of the conductivity.@xcite we integrate the optical conductivity in the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 up to the frequency of the minimum in the conductivity , beyond which inter - band transitions are clearly present .",
    "we take @xmath54 2.59 ev from recent lda calculations.@xcite then using eq .",
    "[ incoherent ] , we obtain @xmath55 @xmath2 1200 @xmath56@xmath47",
    ". we will refer to this lower limit of the conductivity ( upper limit of resistivity ) as the ",
    "@xmath50-sum rule limit . \"",
    "note that the @xmath50-sum rule resistivity is higher than the irm resistivity ( see fig.[sigmat]a , b ) .",
    "the conductivity decreases with increasing temperature but no saturation is observed because @xmath57 at @xmath4 = 550 k is still above the @xmath50-sum rule limit . the coherent part of the conductivity ( the drude peak at @xmath28 = 0 ) persists beyond the irm limit in a regime where the quasiparticle picture is no longer valid .",
    "this is remarkable because some other bad metals with exceptionally short mean free paths usually exhibit a peak at @xmath58 frequency in @xmath11.@xcite    at this stage , we briefly discuss the effect of phonons on the electronic properties of metallic vo@xmath0 .",
    "we calculate 1/@xmath20 for electron - phonon scattering using a square shaped eliashberg function @xmath59 that mimics the phonon spectral density of vo@xmath0.@xcite    @xmath60 \\label{elph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we note that the precise form of @xmath59 is not known for vo@xmath0 but the shape of the calculated 1/@xmath20 plots is not very sensitive to it . the upper cutoff for @xmath59 is taken as 0.1 ev which is the maximum phonon energy of vo@xmath0.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ xtendeddrude]a , electron - phonon coupling theory predicts 1/@xmath20 to be independent of frequency and strongly temperature dependent for frequencies greater than the maximum phonon energy.@xcite however in vo@xmath0 , 1/@xmath20 is frequency dependent and nearly temperature independent at frequencies well above the maximum phonon energy ( fig .  [ xtendeddrude]a ) .",
    "spectroscopic evidence and the lack of resistivity saturation indicate that electron - phonon scattering plays a less significant role in charge dynamics in the metallic phase of vo@xmath0 compared to electronic correlations .",
    "therefore , the linear increase of resistivity and 1/@xmath20 ( @xmath61 0 ) with temperature can not be due to electron - phonon scattering .",
    "we note that there is broad consensus on the breakdown of the conventional quasiparticle picture for @xmath8 ( or @xmath62).@xcite despite attempts to understand transport in bad metals , including proposals beyond conventional fermi liquid theory , there is no convergence of views.@xcite on the other hand , one can not rule out the possibility of electronic phase segregation on a length scale smaller than infrared wavelengths .",
    "also , silver films grown under certain conditions are known to exhibit bad metal behavior due to their peculiar microstructure and not due to any novel physics.@xcite nevertheless , empirical evidence indicates that a common feature of bad metals is the predominance of electronic correlations in their transport properties due to proximity to a mott insulating phase.@xcite we find that metallic vo@xmath0 fits into this picture and suggest that the on - site electronic coulomb repulsion is crucial to bad metal behavior and the mit even though the insulating state may not be a conventional mott insulator.@xcite",
    "we have determined the optical constants of vo@xmath0 films in the insulating and metallic states over a wide temperature and frequency range .",
    "we find that vo@xmath0 is a correlated metal above @xmath1 and the charge dynamics are dominated by electronic correlations rather than electron - phonon scattering . in the metallic state ,",
    "the length and energy scales associated with the scattering processes make it problematic to describe the charge carriers within fermi liquid theory .",
    "however , in contrast to some other bad metals,@xcite the drude peak persists in vo@xmath0 for @xmath8 . we establish that in metallic vo@xmath0 , the increase in resistivity with temperature beyond the irm limit is due to the increase of scattering rate of charge carriers rather than a decrease of carrier density .",
    "the data is consistent with the model based on the fundamental @xmath50-sum rule in optics in which resistivity saturation is not expected at the irm limit.@xcite",
