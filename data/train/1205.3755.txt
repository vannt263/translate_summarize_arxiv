    "weak measurement followed by post - selection @xcite is a powerful inference technique , allowing e.g. to reconstruct the unknown wavefunction of a system @xcite , or the density matrix @xcite .",
    "perhaps `` measurement '' is a misleading term , since due to the weak interaction between system and meter one can not infer substantial information from a single trial .",
    "however , the statistical analysis of the post - selected data  which generally is limited to the average readout but could be extended to the full statistics @xcite  allows to extract information about the system that is not trivially recovered from standard strong projective measurements .",
    "the coherent quantum nature of the meter was shown to be of the essence for the peculiar amplification of the weak measurement @xcite .",
    "several experimental works have focused on signal amplification @xcite . currently , there is some debate about the usefulness of weak measurement for amplification , @xcite .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a way to realize a `` cheshire cat '' by using joint weak measurements of commuting observables of a photon .",
    "the claim is that the grin of the cat ( the polarization of the photon ) is at one arm of the interferometer , while the cat ( the photon itself ) is at the other arm . here ,",
    "we argument that the criterion used for detecting the presence of such a phenomenon , namely that the average outputs of the presence and polarization measurements are both 1 , is inadequate , and we propose using a signed cross - average of the outputs as an indicator of the cheshire cat , with the sign being provided by the post - selection succeeding or not .",
    "in addition to this , we show that such a disembodiment occurs almost always provided that ( 1 ) the system is both prepared and post - selected in states that are ( partially ) coherent superpositions of distinct trajectories ( in particular , when no post - selection is made , the post - selected state is the identity , i.e. the totally incoherent state and no cheshire cat shows ) , and ( 2 ) the measurement is not too strong ( it does not need to be weak , however ) . to this goal , we study the exact statistics of the measurement readouts",
    ". the main and more general results of the present paper are resumed by eqs . .",
    "the relevant quantities are defined in eqs .",
    "with reference to figure  [ fig : setup ] , from bottom to top , a horizontally polarized photon impinges on a non - polarizing beam splitter ( bs1 ) , with asymmetric reflection and transmission , so that the new state of the photon is @xmath3 with @xmath4 referring to the spatial part of the photon propagating , respectively , in the left and right arm , and @xmath5 the reflection and the transmission amplitude of the beam - splitter .     the setup .",
    "the source @xmath6 emits a photon with linear polarization along an arbitrary axis , chosen as the horizontal axis .",
    "an asymmetric beam - splitter @xmath7 splits the photon into a left - travelling and a right - travelling component .",
    "local unitary transformations @xmath8 and @xmath9 are applied to each component .",
    "the state of the photon , just before interacting with the meters , is @xmath10 , and it can be made arbitrary by appropriately choosing the transmission and reflection amplitudes of @xmath7 and the transformations @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "after the interaction , each path is reflected by a mirror and it undergoes a further transformation @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "then , a second asymmetric beam - splitter @xmath13 either transmits the beam to the right , where a detector @xmath14 , able to discriminate between two orthogonal polarizations , is present , or to the left , where there is a detector @xmath15 , which is also able to discriminate between two orthogonal polarizations of the photon , giving a different signal for a different polarization .",
    "finally , the pure state @xmath10 can be replaced by an arbitrary mixed state @xmath16 by judiciously alternating the source @xmath6 with the source @xmath17 and by having an appropriate fraction of the emitted photons with vertical rather than horizontal polarization .",
    "analogously , by selecting an appropriate mixture of the post - selection measurements when @xmath15 reveals a vertically polarized photon , or when @xmath14 clicks revealing either a horizontally or vertically - polarized photon , one can have a post - selection in a mixed state @xmath18.,width=384 ]    in each arm of the interferometer , an appropriate combination of polarization rotators and quarter - wave plates transforms the local state into an arbitrary polarization state , @xmath19 with @xmath20 unitary matrices in the polarization subspace .",

    "finally , a polarization - sensitive detector @xmath15 reveals whether there is a horizontally - polarized photon or a vertically - polarized one . this way ,",
    "if the photon detector @xmath15 reveals a horizontally polarized photon , we can be sure that the state of the photon immediately after the measurement is @xmath35 a simple way for understanding that this is the post - selected state is to consider an event in which the detector @xmath15 measures a horizontally - polarized photon , and then visualize the backward - in - time process : the detector @xmath15 now acts as a source , and it emits a photon with horizontal polarization ; this photon impinges on the beam splitter @xmath13 , and it splits into the state @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the time - reversal state of @xmath38 , etc ; then , the photon undergoes two local unitary transformations , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , which gives the state .",

    "this subjective reduction introduces the time asymmetry that can not be explained by merely considering the laws of physics .    finally , by analyzing data corresponding to the detector @xmath15 revealing a horizontally polarized photon , it is possible to access the conditional probability of observing readouts @xmath43 in the meters , given that the system was prepared in @xmath10 and post - selected in @xmath44 .",
    "we note that , by considering an appropriate mixture of input states , the initial state of the system can be made to coincide with an arbitrary density matrix @xmath16 , while a similar procedure in the post - selection leads to the mixed post - selected state @xmath18 . in order to understand better the various measurement regimes",

    "@xcite in such a way that , in the weak coupling limit , the average outputs take the special values @xmath139 and @xmath140 . from this",
    "it was inferred that the photon is in the left arm , while its polarization is in the right arm .",
    "it seems that the following reasoning is implied : in a strong measurement , in each individual trial , the output at the right arm is 0 , 1 , or @xmath141 , and the output at the left arm is either 0 or 1 .",
    "thus , if in a strong measurement one would observe an average of 1 , this would imply that the detector always gave the output 1 .",
    "however , this inference does not hold for a weak measurement , as it does not take into account that in each individual repetition , since the initial spread of the meter is much larger than the readout scale , the observed readout may be much larger than one ( in absolute value ) . furthermore , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , these large values may not cancel out on the average , and they may yield an average output outside the spectrum of the measured observable .",
    "for instance , one could easily make up a post - selection such that @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",

    "@xcite , a spin-1/2 system , it may make sense to say that the average value of the spin is 100 , since from a classical point of view an angular momentum has no bounds , the example above illustrates the danger of interpreting the average of a weak measurement in a too light - hearted way : it makes no sense , even classically , to say that -100 photons were observed by the left detector .",
    "even if the average over the post - selected data yields 1 , this does not warrant the conclusion that all photons passed in the left arm or all were polarized @xmath148 in the right arm . a better way to ascertain whether the polarization is disembodied from the presence of the photon is to study the average of the product of the two observables .",
    "indeed , inspection of reveals that only interference terms contribute to the numerator of the cross - average @xmath97 , while the local averages @xmath95 and @xmath96 , in general , contain a contribution from the classical part .",
