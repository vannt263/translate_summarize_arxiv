    "in his _ annus mirabilis _ 1905 , albert einstein ( march 14 , 1879 - april 18 , 1955 ) published four cornerstone papers that made him immortal .",
    "apart from his work on the photo - electric effect ( for which he obtained the nobel prize in 1921 ) , wherein he put forward the photon hypothesis , and his two papers on special relativity , he published his first paper on the molecular - kinetic description of brownian motion @xcite .",
    "there , he states ( freely translated from the german ) `` in this work we show , by use of the kinetic theory of heat , that microscopic particles which are suspended in fluids undergo movements of such size that these can be easily detected with a microscope . it is possible that these movements to be investigated here are identical with so - called brownian molecular motion ; the information available to me on the latter , however , is so imprecise that i can not make a judgement . '' in his follow up paper in 1906 @xcite , which contains the term `` brownian motion '' in the title , he provides supplementary technical arguments on his derivation and additionally presents a treatment of rotational brownian motion . in this second paper",
    "he also cites experimental work on brownian motion by m. gouy @xcite ( but not robert brown ) .",
    "einstein seemingly was unaware of the earliest observations of brownian motion under a microscope : namely , the work of the dutch physician jan ingen - housz @xcite , who detected , probably first , brownian motion of finely ground charcoal particles in a suspension at the focal point of a microscope , and the detailed studies by the renown botanist robert brown @xcite . in clear contrast to robert brown , who performed a series of experiments , ingen - housz provided a quite incorrect physical explanation of his observations by ascribing the effect to the evaporation of the suspension fluid .",
    "the two founders of brownian motion theory , einstein and smoluchowski @xcite , as well as their contemporaries , were also unaware of related , mathematical - statistical precursors of the phenomenon : already in 1880 , n. thiele @xcite proposed a model of brownian motion while studying time series .",
    "another important development is the work by the founder of modern mathematical finance , louis bachelier @xcite , who attempted to model the market noise of the paris bourse through a gaussian process .",
    "moreover , lord rayleigh @xcite also did study a discrete , heavy random walker and performed a corresponding limiting procedure towards a heat equation which is augmented by a drift term for the statistical velocity .",
    "these mathematical - statistical works already contain implicitly , via the ( gaussian)-propagator solution of the corresponding heat or diffusion equation , the main result of einstein : namely , his pivotal analysis of the mean squared displacement of brownian motion .",
    "einstein focused on what is nowadays characterized as _ overdamped brownian motion_. he was driven by the quest for the missing connection between macroscopic and molecular dimensions . in doing so ,",
    "his result exhibits truly remarkable features :    * the average distance traveled by the brownian particle is not ballistic .",
    "the latter only holds for transient , very short times , typically of the order of @xmath0 seconds , or smaller ; an estimate , which already albert einstein provided in a subsequent short note @xcite .",
    "a benchmark result of brownian motion theory is that the average displacement ( after the above mentioned short transient ) is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the velocity of a brownian particle is not a useful measurable quantity .",
    "indeed , earlier experimental attempts aimed at measuring the velocity of brownian particles ,  like those by sigmund exner @xcite , and many years later , the repeated , but far better devised quantitative measurements by his son felix exner in 1900 @xcite ,  yielded puzzling results , and consequently were doomed to failure .    *",
    "einstein also showed that the diffusion strength is related to the boltzmann constant ( i.e. , to the ratio of the ideal gas constant @xmath2 and the avogadro - loschmidt number @xmath3 ) and the molecular dimension via the expression of stokes friction .",
    "the last finding motivated jean perrin and collaborators @xcite to undertake detailed experiments on brownian motion , thereby accurately determining the value for the avogadro - loschmidt number .",
    "the relation described in this second feature also provides a first link between dissipative forces and fluctuations .",
    "einstein relation _ is a first example of the intimate relation between thermal noise and dissipation that characterizes thermal equilibrium : it is known under the label of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , put on firm ground only much later @xcite .",
    "it is just this overdamped brownian noise which we attempt to harvest with the concept of a brownian motor @xcite .",
    "put differently : can one extract energy from brownian ( quantum or classical ) particles in asymmetric set - ups in order to perform useful work against an external load ?",
    "if true , then it would be possible to rectify thermal brownian motion so as to separate , shuttle or pump particles on a micro- or even nano - scale .",
    "in view of the laws of thermodynamics , in particular the second law , the answer is obviously a firm _",
    "no_. if we could indeed succeed , then such a devilish device would constitute a maxwell demon perpetuum mobile of the second kind @xcite .",
    "the only back door open is thus to go away from thermal equilibrium , so that the constraints of thermodynamic laws no longer apply .",
    "this leads us to study non - equilibrium statistical mechanics in asymmetric systems .",
    "there , the symmetry is broken either ( i ) by the system characteristics , such as an asymmetric periodic potential ( or substrate ) which lacks reflection symmetry , called ratchet - like potentials , or ( ii ) the dynamics itself that may break the symmetry in the time domain .",
    "clearly , noise - induced , directed transport in the presence of a static bias is trivial .",
    "it is also an everyday experience that macroscopic , unbiased disturbances can cause directed motion .",
    "the example of a self - winding wrist watch , or even windmills prove the case .",
    "the challenge becomes rather intricate when we consider motion on the micro - scale .",
    "there , the subtle interplay of thermal noise , nonlinearity , asymmetry , and _ unbiased _ driving of either stochastic , or chaotic , or deterministic origin can indeed induce a rectification of the noise , resulting in directed motion of brownian particles @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "new roadways open up to optimize and control transport on the micro- and/or nano - scale .",
    "this includes novel applications in physics , nano - chemistry , materials science , nano - electronics and , prominently , also for directed transport in biological systems such as in molecular motors @xcite . in the next section , the concept of a brownian motor will be illustrated with a diffusive brownian motor .",
    "in order to elucidate the _ modus operandi _ of a brownian motor , we consider a brownian particle with mass @xmath4 and friction coefficient @xmath5 in one dimension with coordinate @xmath6 , being driven by an external static force @xmath7 and thermal noise .",
    "the corresponding stochastic dynamics thus reads : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a periodic potential with period @xmath10 , @xmath11 which exhibits broken spatial symmetry ( a so - called ratchet potential ) .",
    "a typical example is @xmath12 \\ , \\label{2.3}\\ ] ] which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . 0.5 cm    .",
    "it is periodic in the spatial coordinate with period @xmath10 and exhibits a broken spatial symmetry .",
    "plotted here is the example from ( [ 2.3 ] ) , in dimensionless units . ]",
    "thermal fluctuations are modelled by a gaussian white noise of vanishing mean , @xmath13 , satisfying einstein s _ fluctuation - dissipation _ relation , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath16 denotes the equilibrium temperature .    in extremely small systems , particle fluctuations",
    "are often described to a good approximation by the _ overdamped _ limit of eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) , i.e. , by the langevin equation @xmath17 where the inertia term @xmath18 has been neglected altogether [ as implicit in einstein s work ] .    in the absence of an external bias ,",
    "i.e. @xmath19 , the second law of thermodynamics implies that the thermal equilibrium stochastic dynamics can not support a stationary current , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "this can be readily proven @xcite upon solving the corresponding fokker - planck equation in the space of periodic probability functions , with the stationary probability being of the boltzmann form .",
    "this pivotal result no longer holds , however , when we complement our archetype model by a non - equilibrium , _ unbiased _",
    "( i.e. zero mean ) disturbance .",
    "an instructive way consists in applying a temporally varying temperature @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being a periodic function in time @xcite .",
    "this means that the einstein relation is modified to read @xmath23 with the temperature obeying @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the period of the temperature modulation .",
    "most importantly , such an explicit time dependence moves the system _ out of thermal equilibrium_. in particular , the system dynamics is no longer time - homogeneous ; it thus breaks also the detailed balance symmetry @xcite .",
    "note that this latter symmetry must always be obeyed in thermal equilibrium .",
    "a typical periodic temperature modulation is : @xmath26 ) \\label{2.6}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] denotes the signum function , and @xmath28 .",
    "this variation of the temperature @xmath16 in ( [ 2.6 ] ) causes jumps of @xmath22 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 at every half - period @xmath31 . due to these cyclic changes of the temperature ,",
    "the system approaches a periodic long - time stationary state which , in general , can be investigated only numerically in terms of floquet theory @xcite .",
    ".5 cm     and height @xmath32 which are subjected to a temperature that changes in time between the values `` hot '' and `` cold '' , @xmath33 $ ] . for simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "the dashed line in the middle panel indicates the level @xmath36 below which circa 95 % of the particles are found at any given time .",
    "initially , when the temperature is cold , the particles are pinned at a potential minimum .",
    "then , when the temperature is switched to `` hot '' , the particles effectively do not feel the potential and begin to diffuse . in the middle illustration",
    "the thin red line indicates a gaussian - like shape for the corresponding particle distribution .",
    "when the temperature is low again , any particles that have diffused the short distance @xmath37 , with @xmath38 , to the right are caught in the well to the right ; likewise , any particles that have diffused the long distance @xmath39 towards the left are caught in the well to the left , and the rest are pinned again in the original well from which they started out . because the chance for a particle to diffuse over the short distance @xmath40 during the time when the temperature is high is much larger than the chance to diffuse over the long distance @xmath41 , a net motion to the right is induced by such cyclic temperature fluctuations . ]    in the case of a static tilted brownian motor with a fixed temperature @xmath16 , we immediately see that for a given force , say @xmath42 , the particle will on average move `` downhill '' , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "this fact holds true for _ any fixed _ ,",
    "non - zero value of the temperature @xmath16 .",
    "returning to the temperature ratchet with @xmath16 being subjected to periodic , temporal variations , one should expect that the particles still move `` downhill '' on the average .",
    "the numerically calculated corresponding `` load curve '' ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) demonstrates , however , that the opposite is true within an entire interval of _ negative _ bias values @xmath7 : surprisingly indeed , _",
    "the particles are climbing `` uphill '' on the average , thereby performing work against the load force @xmath7_. this upward directed motion is apparently triggered by no other source than the thermal fluctuations @xmath44 .",
    "this key finding is just what is commonly referred to as the _ brownian motor effect _ @xcite .    because the average particle current @xmath45 depends continuously on the load force @xmath7 , it is sufficient for a qualitative analysis to consider the case @xmath19 : _ the occurrence of the brownian motor or ratchet effect is then tantamount to a finite current _",
    "@xmath46 i.e. , the unbiased brownian motor implements a _ directed motion of particles_.      in order to understand the basic physical mechanism behind the ratchet effect at @xmath19 , we focus on very strong , i.e. @xmath47 but adiabatically slow , periodic two - state temperature modulations from ( [ 2.6 ] ) . during a first time interval , say @xmath48 $ ] , the thermal energy @xmath49 is kept at a constant value @xmath50 much _ smaller _ than the potential barrier @xmath51 between two neighboring local minima of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , all particles will have accumulated in a close vicinity of the potential minima at the end of this time interval , as sketched in the top panel of fig .",
    ". then , the thermal energy jumps to a value @xmath52 much _ larger _ than @xmath51 and remains stable during another half period , say @xmath53 $ ] . because the particles then barely feel the potential profile in comparison to the intense noise level , the particles spread out subject to free thermal diffusion  see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , middle panel .",
    "finally , @xmath22 jumps back to its original `` cool '' value @xmath54 and the particles slide downhill towards the closest local minima of @xmath9 . due to the lack of reflection symmetry of the function @xmath9 ,",
    "the original population of one given potential well is thus re - distributed asymmetrically , yielding a net average displacement after one temporal period @xmath25 .    when the temperature is varied very slowly during a cycle ( and restricting the discussion to the case that the potential @xmath9 has only one minimum and maximum per period @xmath10 , like in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) it is quite obvious that if the local minimum is closer to its adjacent maximum located to the right , a positive particle current @xmath55 will arise . put differently , upon inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , it is intuitively clear that during the cool - down cycle the particles must diffuse a long distance to the left , but only a short distance to the right .",
    "this in turn induces a net transport against the steeper potential slope towards the right .",
    "all these predictions rely on our assumptions that @xmath56 are much smaller / larger than @xmath51 , and that the time - period @xmath57 is sufficiently large .",
    "the brownian motor effect ( [ 2.7 ] ) occurs for very general temperature modulations @xmath22 , as well . for the same reason ,",
    "the ratchet effect is also robust with respect to modifications of the potential shape @xcite and is recovered even for random instead of deterministic modulations of @xmath22 @xcite , with a modified dynamics on a discrete state space @xcite , and in the presence of finite inertia @xcite .",
    "the directed particle current is clearly bound to vanish in the so termed adiabatic limit ( i.e. for asymptotically , very slow temperature modulations ) , when thermal equilibrium is approached .",
    "a similar conclusion holds true for asymptotically fast temperature modulations . by use of a correspondent",
    ", perturbative floquet analysis one finds the noteworthy result that the current decays to zero in both asymptotic regimes remarkably fast , namely like @xmath58 in the slow modulation limit , and @xmath59 , in the fast modulation limit , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , for non - adiabatic temperature variations , the brownian motion in a diffusive brownian motor moving on a tailored ratchet profile is generally not rectified in its `` natural '' direction , but rather in the opposite direction @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies a time - scale induced ( non - adiabatic ) current - reversal : it is this very feature that is required for an efficient separation of particles of different size , or other transport qualifiers such as friction , mass , etc ..      we can not emphasize enough that the ratchet effect , as exemplified in the temperature brownian motor model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , is _ not _ in contradiction with the second law of thermodynamics : the temperature changes in ( [ 2.6 ] ) are caused by two heat environments at two different temperatures with which the brownian motor system is in continuous contact . from this viewpoint , this archetype brownian motor is nothing else than an extremely simple , small heat engine .",
    "the fact that such a device can produce work is therefore not a miracle  but it is still very intriguing .",
    "the following characteristics are a hallmark of brownian motors .",
    "consider the `` relevant state variables '' @xmath6 and @xmath22 of our temperature brownian motor . in the case of an ordinary heat engine",
    ", these two state variables would always cycle through one and the same periodic sequence of events ( `` working strokes '' ) .",
    "put differently , the evolutions of the state variables @xmath6 and @xmath22 would be tightly coupled and almost synchronized .    in clear contrast to this familiar scenario , _ the relevant state variables of a genuine brownian motor",
    "are loosely coupled _ : some degree of interaction is required for the functioning of the brownian motor , but while @xmath22 completes one cycle , @xmath6 may evolve in a very different way .",
    "the spatial coordinate @xmath6 is certainly not _",
    "slaved _ by the unbiased modulation of the temperature @xmath22 .",
    "this _ loose coupling between state variables _ is a salient feature of a brownian motor device and distinguishes the brownian motor concept from micron - sized , but otherwise quite conventional thermo - mechanical or even purely mechanical engines . in particular , indispensable ingredients of",
    "any _ genuine brownian motor are : ( i ) the presence of some amount of ( not necessarily thermal ) noise ; ( ii ) some sort of symmetry - breaking supplemented by temporal periodicity ( possibly via an unbiased , non - equilibrium forcing ) , if a cyclically operating device is involved .",
    "it is thus not appropriate to advertise every such small ratchet device under the trendy label of `` brownian motor '' .",
    "this holds true especially if the governing transport principle is deterministic , like in mechanical ratchet devices of macro- or mesoscopic size , such as a ratchet wrench , interlocked mechanical gears , or leonardo s `` cochlea '' @xcite and other `` screw - like '' pumping and propulsion devices . by the way , it is suggestive to notice how leonardo sketched a ratchet - like machinery just to prove the impossibility of the _ perpetuum mobile _",
    "@xcite .",
    "yet another distinguishing feature of a brownian motor is that noise ( no matter what its source , i.e. stochastic , or chaotic , or thermal ) plays a non - negligible , or even a dominant role . in particular , it is the intricate interplay among nonlinearity , noise - activated escape dynamics and non - equilibrium driving which implies , that , generally , _ not even the direction of transport _ is _ a priori _ predictable .",
    "see also in sects . 4 and 5 below .",
    "the necessary condition for the brownian motor effect is to operate away from thermal equilibrium , namely , in a state with no detailed balance .",
    "this was achieved above through the cyclic variation of the temperature ( [ 2.6 ] ) ; but there clearly exists a great variety of other forms of non - equilibrium perturbations @xcite .",
    "the following guiding prescriptions should be observed when designing a more general _ brownian motor _ :    * spatial and/or temporal periodicity critically affect rectification . *",
    "all acting forces and gradients must vanish after averaging over space , time , and statistical ensembles .",
    "* random forces ( of thermal , non - thermal , or even deterministic origin ) assume a prominent role .",
    "* detailed balance symmetry must be broken by moving the system away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "* a symmetry - breaking must apply .    there",
    "exist several possibilities to induce symmetry - breaking .",
    "first , the spatial inversion symmetry of the periodic system itself may be broken _ intrinsically _ ; that is , already in the absence of non - equilibrium perturbations .",
    "this is the most common situation and typically involves a type of periodic asymmetric ( so - called ratchet ) potential .",
    "a second option consists in the use of a deterministic , unbiased skew forcing @xmath60 .",
    "for example , these may be _ stochastic _",
    "fluctuations @xmath60 possessing non - vanishing , higher order odd multi - time moments  notwithstanding the requirement that they must be unbiased , i.e. the first moment vanishes @xcite .",
    "such an asymmetry can also be created by unbiased _",
    "periodic _ non - equilibrium perturbations @xmath60 . both variants in turn",
    "induce a spatial asymmetry of the dynamics .",
    "yet a third possibility arises via a collective effect in coupled , perfectly symmetric non - equilibrium systems , namely in the form of _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ @xcite .",
    "note that in the latter two cases we speak of a brownian motor dynamics even though a ratchet - potential is not necessarily involved .",
    "an instructive demo java applet of a brownian motor can be found on the web @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we shall illustrate this concept for the case of a temporal , _ dynamical symmetry breaking_. this approach is readily implemented experimentally , and therefore does carry a great potential for novel applications and devices .",
    "what we call a ratchet mechanism is to some extent a matter of taste .",
    "our _ bona fide _ ratchet prescriptions in sec .",
    "2.2 apply indeed to a number of diverse microscopic rectification mechanisms that have been known for a long time , well before the notion of brownian motor became popular .",
    "such mechanisms do involve ingredients like spatial periodicity , random forces , non - equilibrium ( detailed balance breaking ) and zero - mean external biases ( both in space and time ) .",
    "however , in this category of processes the reflection asymmetry of the substrate plays no essential role , although its presence may add certain sofar unnoticed similarities with the ratchet phenomenology . a common feature of all these non - ratchet , or possibly ratchet - related , rectification mechanisms is some degree of temporal synchronization between input signal(s ) and/or spatial modulation of the substrate , leading to a dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "a charged particle spatially confined by a nonlinear force is capable of mixing two alternating input electric fields of angular frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath62 , its response containing all possible higher harmonics of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and their sum and difference frequencies . for commensurate input frequencies , i.e. , @xmath63 , there appears a rectified output component , too @xcite : such a dc harmonic mixing ( hm ) signal is an @xmath64-th order effect in the dynamical parameters of the system @xcite .",

    "<S> in systems possessing a spatial or dynamical symmetry breaking thermal brownian motion combined with unbiased , non - equilibrium noise gives rise to a channelling of chance that can be used to exercise control over systems at the micro- and even on the nano - scale . </S>",
    "<S> this theme is known as `` brownian motor '' concept . </S>",
    "<S> the constructive role of ( the generally overdamped ) brownian motion is exemplified for a noise - induced transport of particles within various set - ups . </S>",
    "<S> we first present the working principles and characteristics with a proof - of - principle device , a diffusive temperature brownian motor . </S>",
    "<S> next , we consider very recent applications based on the phenomenon of signal mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is particularly simple to implement experimentally in order to optimize and selectively control a rich variety of directed transport behaviors . </S>",
    "<S> the subtleties and also the potential for brownian motors operating in the quantum regime are outlined and some state - of - the - art applications , together with future roadways , are presented . </S>"
