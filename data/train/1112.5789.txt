    "the search of new topological states of matter has never been stopped since the discovery of the quantum hall state in 1980s.@xcite in particular , in recent years the study of `` topological insulators '' ( ti ) becomes one of the most active fields in condensed - matter physics , not only for its importance to fundamental physics but also for its potential application in spintronics or thermoelectrics.@xcite this new insulating phase is distinguished from the conventional one by a non - trivial z@xmath0 topological invariant and robust gapless edge states in two dimensions ( 2d)@xcite or surface states in three dimensions ( 3d)@xcite , against moderate perturbations which preserve time reversal symmetry ( trs ) .",
    "generally , such topological insulating state can occur in a system with strong spin - orbit coupling that explicitly breaks spin rotational symmetry ( srs ) , resulting in the band inversion phenomenon .",
    "typical materials which exhibit ti phase are found in , for instance , the hgte / cdte quantum wells ( 2d ) , bi@xmath1sb@xmath2 , bi@xmath0se@xmath3 , bi@xmath0te@xmath3 ( 3d ) , and so on.@xcite however , an alternative route to ti is possible and it is associated with the concept of topological mott insulator , first studied in ref . [ ] in _ strongly correlated _ systems .",
    "there are two key and generic ingredients in this approach .",
    "first , the fermi surface of the non - interacting system should shrink to discrete points ( 2d ) or lines ( 3d ) , and hence it is semi - metallic ; second , there exists a suitable repulsive interaction , which can dynamically generate spin - orbit coupling through spontaneously broken srs , as first discovered by wu and zhang.@xcite a few pioneering examples along this line of thought have been discussed in various lattice geometries , _",
    "e.g. _ , honeycomb,@xcite checkerboard,@xcite kagome,@xcite and diamond lattices.@xcite        here we show that topological states can be generally realized in a system with quadratic band crossing points ( bcps ) , which are symmetry protected at non - interacting level . near such kind of bcp , instability towards phases with broken symmetry symmetries",
    "is inevitable even if there is only weak interaction between electrons . to demonstrate this",
    ", we construct a concrete model with such a bcp on an extended 2d lieb lattice .",
    "there are several reasons for us to choose the lieb lattice .",
    "first , the lieb lattice has three sites per unit cell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] . with only nearest - neighbor ( nn )",
    "hoppings , there is a _ dispersionless _ ( flat ) band in the middle of the band structure .",
    "there are three scenarios to alter this non - generic crossing between this flat band and the two other bands , depending on the values of the onsite potentials or the presence of further range hoppings : ( i ) the flat band touches upper and lower linearly dispersing bands at one point when all lattice sites have equal onsite potentials .",
    "( ii ) the flat band can be isolated .",
    "for instance , one can add intrinsic spin - orbit couplings as discussed by weeks and franz.@xcite ( iii ) when the onsite potential on @xmath4 sublattice is not equal to that of @xmath5/@xmath6 sublattices , the flat band only touches one of the other two bands , which becomes quadratically dispersing , instead of linearly dispersing.@xcite thus , these choices could variegate our results .",
    "second , a nearly flat band can have non - zero chern number ( see sec .",
    "finally , the 2d lieb lattice has been the most important building block in many 3d perovskite materials featured with complex phase diagram and strongly electron - electron correlations .",
    "thus study of the model can be viewed as a preliminary investigation of the ti phase especially in layered perovskites composed of weakly coupled 2d planes with lieb lattice structure ( _ e.g. _ , the well - known high-@xmath7 cuprates ) .    in this paper , we start with the construction of the explicit model and reveal the topological nature of the bcp at non - interacting level .",
    "we then examine the consequence of such topological bcp , _",
    "i.e. _ , with a symmetry protected berry flux @xmath8 , under the presence of short - range repulsive interactions .",
    "we investigate various symmetry breaking instabilities at bcp within self - consistent mean - field approximation .",
    "note that we mainly focus on type ( iii ) band structure , namely , only two bands touch together , and compare it with the case of type ( i ) when necessary . in principle , for the bcp there are two ways to gain energy : one is to open a gap at bcp , and the other one is to split into two dirac points ( each with berry flux @xmath9 ) , but with the price of broken @xmath10 symmetry . to justify this speculation",
    ", we show phase diagrams for spinless / spinful fermions at 1/3 or 2/3 filling , according to the position of the bcp in the band structure .",
    "in fact , at both fillings the phase diagrams are qualitatively similar with subtle differences due to particle - hole asymmetry introduced by the interactions . in the spinless case ,",
    "the leading order under `` weak '' next nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) repulsion is the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulating state ( trs broken ) . for `` strong '' nnn repulsion",
    ", the ground state evolves into insulating nematic state ( @xmath10 symmetry broken down to @xmath11 ) .",
    "in addition , for intermediate strength , there exists a narrow coexistence region between these two orders . in the spinful case ,",
    "the phase diagrams are more complicated .",
    "besides the phases we find in the spinless case , there are also a quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulating state and a nematic - spin - nematic semi - metallic phase with dirac nodes.@xcite thus , we clearly demonstrate that , in principle , correlated systems with lieb lattice structure can be a potential host to tis .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model and demonstrate the topological nature of its bcp from both momentum and real - space point of view . next , the consequences of introducing short - range repulsions are discussed for spinless fermions in section iii a and for spinful fermions in section iii b , respectively .",
    "finally , we discuss some issues and make conclusions in sec iv .",
    "we begin with the tight - binding model for non - interacting fermions , _ 0=-_ijt_ijc^_ic_j + _ i_i c^_ic_i , [ eq : h0 ] where @xmath12 creates a fermion on site @xmath13 of the 2d lieb lattice ,",
    "the unit cell of which is given by @xmath14 sites shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] . for simplicity , we take the hopping amplitudes , @xmath15 , between nn sites @xmath16 , and @xmath17 otherwise for the moment . the effect of adding longer - range hopping amplitudes ( but small in magnitude ) will be discussed later when appropriate .",
    "note that the @xmath10 point group symmetry dictates that the onsite potentials on the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equal , @xmath18 .",
    "although @xmath19 are generically non - zero , only their relative values are essential to determine the symmetry of the lattice , and hence , the band structure . therefore , hereafter we set the units of energy @xmath20 , the lattice constant @xmath21 , and , without loss of generality , @xmath22 .      the band structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) can be obtained by transforming @xmath23 into momentum space , _ 0=_^_h_0 ( ) _ , [ eq : h0 ] where the fermion spinor , @xmath24 , with sublattice ( basis ) index @xmath14 and @xmath25 . defining the displacement vectors , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath28 is of the form h_0()= (    [ c]ccc_a & -2 t ( _ 1 ) & -2 t ( _ 2 ) + & 0 & 0 + & & 0    ) , where the lower triangular matrix is understood to be filled for keeping the whole matrix hermitian . in this notation ,",
    "the first brillouin zone ( fbz ) is a square with four time reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) : @xmath29 , and @xmath30 [ see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum](a ) ] .",
    "the energy spectrum consists of two dispersive bands , @xmath31 with @xmath32 ^ 2 $ ] , and one _ dispersionless _ flat band , @xmath33 .",
    "an important feature of this model is that the presence or absence of @xmath34 can change electronic properties dramatically .",
    "when @xmath35 , the flat band touches two linearly dispersing bands at @xmath36 point in the fbz [ type ( i ) ] , where the linear bands meet as if there were a `` dirac point '' .",
    "however , the touching point in fact has completely different structure .",
    "it becomes clear once we expand @xmath28 around @xmath36 point with @xmath37 .",
    "to the first order in @xmath38 , @xmath28 can be written as h_0()~v_f , [ eq : spin1h0 ] where the fermi velocity @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the ( pseudo ) spin-1 matrices are defined as l_x= (    ccc 0 & 1 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0    ) , l_y= (    ccc 0 & 0 & 1 + 0 & 0 & 0 + 1 & 0 & 0    ) , l_z= (    ccc 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & -i + 0 & i & 0    ) , obeying lie algebra of su(2 ) , i.e. , @xmath41=i\\epsilon_{ijk}l_k$],@xcite instead of a clifford algebra as in the case of graphene .",
    "this is the fundamental reason why there is no dirac point and hence no fermion doubling problem@xcite on the lieb lattice .",
    "viewing the low - energy effective hamiltonian @xmath42 as a `` spin '' @xmath43 in an external `` magnetic field '' @xmath44 , its eigenvalues can be easily read out as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 are the quantized angular momenta along the axis parallel to @xmath44 in three dimensions .",
    "space : ( a ) the planar vector field @xmath47 ; ( b ) the planar vector field @xmath44 . ]    when @xmath48 , however , the spin-1 structure mentioned above is no longer valid .",
    "the flat band now touches only one dispersive ( massive ) energy band either above or below at @xmath36 point , depending on the sign of @xmath34 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ( b ) ] . to make this structure transparent , we again expand @xmath28 around @xmath36 with small @xmath38 .",
    "assuming @xmath49 and @xmath50 at 2/3 filling , we then integrate out the contribution from basis @xmath4 ( due to almost fully filled @xmath4 sublattice ) and obtain a low - energy effective two - band hamiltonian , h^eff_0()~ (    cc p_x^2 & p_x p_y + p_x p_y & p_y^2    ) = d_i i+d_x_x+d_z_z , [ eq : heff ] where @xmath51 .",
    "in the last equality , we express @xmath52 in terms of the identity and pauli matrices with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , if we further allow small third - neighbor hoppings @xmath56 ( but _ forbid _ to hop whenever there is a site in the middle of the path ) , the flat band becomes slightly dispersive and the effective hamiltonian changes to @xmath57 , @xmath54 , and @xmath58 without removing the band crossing point ( bcp ) [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( b ) ] .",
    "such point at @xmath59 is the so - called quadratic band crossing point ( qbcp ) , which has been studied recently by several research groups.@xcite one of the key features for qbcp in 2d is that its density of states ( dos ) is non - zero at the crossing point , in sharp contrast to the case of dirac points .",
    "this will lead to essential difference when responding to the weak interactions present in the system . in the following ,",
    "we will mainly focus on the @xmath60 case and show that the bcp in our model is not only topologically non - trivial , but also make the system be a potential host to topological phases under weak repulsive interactions .",
    "the band touching phenomenon on the lieb lattice is quite generic and stable for non - interacting fermions .",
    "such stability deserves a full analysis here .",
    "we shall provide two different approaches to show it : one is based on momentum - space topology , and the other one is based on real - space topology .    from the first point of view",
    ", the bcp actually forms a topological defect in the momentum space , similar to a vortex in a 2d superconductor , here with a winding number @xmath61 . to see this ,",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) as @xmath62 , where the `` magnetic field '' @xmath63 .",
    "this effective hamiltonian now represents a spin-1/2 particle sitting in a magnetic field @xmath47 , which has a vortex structure at @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex](a ) . for comparison ,",
    "recall that for @xmath35 we instead have a spin-1 particle in an external field @xmath44 [ eq .  ( [ eq : spin1h0 ] ) ] ,",
    "whose structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vortex](b ) .",
    "the winding number @xmath64 then can be easily extracted from the figures that in the former case , @xmath65 ; in the latter case , @xmath66 .",
    "however , somewhat counter intuitively , both cases are associated with the same berry phase of the bcp,@xcite which can be calculated precisely by b^n = i_du_n|_|u_n , [ eq : berry ] where @xmath67 is a contour in the @xmath38 space enclosing the touching point , @xmath68 denotes any one of the involved bands , and @xmath69 represents the bloch wave function for @xmath68th band .",
    "a simple argument solves this puzzle .",
    "the line integral along any loop enclosing 0 in @xmath38 space given above is known to be 1/2 ( 1 ) times the solid angle subtended by @xmath70 [ @xmath71 from the origin for a spin 1/2 ( 1 ) particle .",
    "thus , @xmath72 in the former case , which is just equivalent to @xmath73 in the latter one .",
    "in fact , when @xmath74 , any infinitesimal mixing ( perturbation ) between bands would lift the degeneracy . with non - vanishing @xmath75 , we confirm that the bcp on the lieb lattice at non - interacting level is topologically stable ( i.e. , not opening a gap ) as long as the spinless system preserves both trs and @xmath10 point group symmetry .",
    "note that @xmath10 symmetry in our model is quite essential , as a similar qbcp happens in the a - b stacking bilayer graphene ( with @xmath76 symmetry ) while it can easily decay into dirac bcps and thus is topologically unstable.@xcite     on the lieb lattice ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "only those sites in the shaded area have non - zero weights , whose magnitudes are denoted by numbers ( up to a normalization factor ) . the weights on @xmath4 sublattice ( blue dots ) are all zero . ]",
    "an alternative point of view for the protection of such bcp on the lieb lattice can be associated with certain topological structure present in the real space , or more specifically , with the existence of the eigenstates which are extended along _ non - contractible _ loops winding around the whole lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( _ i.e. _ , a torus).@xcite to demonstrate this feature , we first take the merit of the flat band , which allows us to construct its corresponding localized , one - particle eigenstates of @xmath23 ( wannier states ) . taking @xmath77 to be the coordinate of the central site of the shaded plaquette shown in fig .",

    "the extra state can not come from the flat band , but from one of the dispersive bands .",

    "the insulating cn phase takes over the phase diagram and this is consistent with the result shown in the spinless model .",
    "two remarks are worth mentioning here .",

    "however , when @xmath113 becomes stronger , it is quite possible that the system might gain certain energy by opening a gap due to translation symmetry breaking , and hence beyond our current consideration .",
    "the second point is about the system at 1/3 filling with @xmath164 .",
    "in fact , the phase diagram is qualitatively similar to that of 2/3 filling and therefore we omit it without further discussion .",
    "the model we have solved on the lieb lattice demonstrates that the ti ( qah / qsh state ) can be induced by appropriate interactions through spontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism , which dynamically generates spin - orbit couplings necessary for a topological insulator .",
    "it is then natural to ask how it can be realized experimentally .",
    "we notice that in the interaction - driven scenario there are two key conditions that a system has to fulfill : 1 ) the band structure should contain suitable band crossing point at which two touching bands have opposite curvatures .",
    "2 ) the system should have weak ( or no ) spin - orbit coupling [ spin su(2 ) symmetry is preserved ] and nnn repulsions need to be more significant than the other short - range repulsions . while the condition 2 ) is tricky and we have to reserve it for future investigation , we would like to comment on some possible routes for condition 1 ) below .",
    "first of all , the most promising candidate , we believe , is from cold atom system . as discussed by goldman et al . in ref .  , the lieb lattice may be constructed as an optical lattice created by properly arranged laser beams .",
    "in particular , the spin - orbit interaction , which might be an issue in traditional materials , now becomes irrelevant .",
    "another potential way for realizing lieb lattice may come from layered perovskites .",
    "a well - known example is the cuo@xmath0 plane in high-@xmath7 cuprates such as la@xmath2sr@xmath222cuo@xmath223 or yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath224 , whose electronic structure might be captured by a three - band model with @xmath225 and @xmath226 orbitals . here ,",

    "the band structure in the fbz along high symmetry lines is presented in fig .",

    "the first way out is to add decorated elements with suitable orbital nature ( e.g. , @xmath232-orbital ) between atoms on @xmath5 and @xmath6 sites that could change the sign of @xmath231 .",
    "this change leads to the band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrumreal](b ) with `` right '' curvatures now . keeping the same orbital characters ,",
    "the second way is to search for a new system among perovskite materials , whose model hamiltonian is similar to that given by sun et al.s recent work in appendix f.@xcite",
    "the key feature of such three - band model is that the dominating transfer integrals are now associated with distance @xmath233 after hopping .",
    "for instance , if , by certain geometric reason , the relevant orbital on @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) sublattice becomes @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) , instead of @xmath235 ( @xmath234 ) as in the cuprates , the above consideration could be plausible .    before concluding our work",
    ", we would like make a brief remark for the possible new physics brought by the ( nearly ) flat band appearing in the lieb lattice .",
    "consider @xmath116 and only nn hoppings in our spinless model . now , the middle band is completely flat and touches with the lower dispersive band at @xmath36 in fbz . at 1/3 filling",
    "if we turn on @xmath114 , the ground state would enter qah state with an energy gap @xmath236 opened at @xmath36 . as we have mentioned in sec .",
    "iii a , the middle and lower bands acquire chern numbers @xmath138 , while the upper one has zero chern number in this phase .",
    "moreover , the flatness of the middle band is approximately determined by the ratio of band - gap to bandwidth @xmath237 . in other words , with appropriately chosen @xmath238 , one can produce a nearly flat band with non - trivial chern number .",
    "this result is quite significant since it may provide an opportunity to realize _ fractional _ qah state ( or _ fractional _",
    "z@xmath0 ti in the spinful case ) when such band is partially filled.@xcite    in conclusion , we have studied interacting spinless / spinful fermions on the ( extended ) lieb lattice and have explored the possibilities of various spontaneously broken symmetries associated with a bcp in the band structure .",
    "due to the topological nature of the bcp , namely , with berry phase @xmath8 , we have seen that in the @xmath168 phase diagram the system can exhibit topological qah / qsh , nematic , and nematic - spin - nematic phases , depending on the strengths of short - range density - density interactions . in particular , the existence of ti phase firmly justifies the interaction - driven scenario .",
    "moreover , for a quadratic bcp ( as @xmath239 ) , only weak interaction is necessary for inducing the ti phase , which is in sharp contrast to the systems with dirac points .",
    "in addition , in our model there exists a flat band , which is interesting on its own right and we argue that in principle , one can obtain a nearly flat _ topological _ band without external magnetic field , a starting point to realize exotic correlated phases of matter .",
    "still , there are many open issues and they deserve further investigation . for instance , one could consider the effect of the chemical potential away from the bcp or the instability to superconductivity from both repulsions and attractions , with special focus on the possibility of any topological nature . finally , we hope our work can further stimulate people to search for a new family of tis in the perovskite - related materials , where , due to the presence of transition elements , the strong correlations may not be ignored .",
