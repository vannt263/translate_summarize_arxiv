    "binary systems tend to shrink when they transfer mass from the more massive to the less massive star .",
    "the consequent contraction of the donor s roche lobe leads to high transfer rates , proceeding on a thermal or near  dynamical timescale depending on whether this star is predominantly radiative or convective .",
    "there is evidently a tendency for such systems to enter common envelope ( ce ) evolution , where the donor star engulfs the system ( paczyski 1976 ; ostriker 1976 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "the archetypal case arises when the donor star fills its roche lobe as a giant .",
    "the strong dissipation caused by the accretor moving within the common envelope may then produce two effects : ( a ) the binary orbit shrinks , releasing orbital binding energy , and ( b ) this energy release may unbind the envelope entirely , stopping the process before the accretor merges with the core of the donor . features ( a ) and ( b ) are highly desirable in explaining the formation of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , where a low  mass main sequence star orbits a white dwarf at a separation considerably smaller than the radius of the white dwarf s giant progenitor , and indeed for tight binary formation in general .    despite this early promise , several decades of strenuous effort",
    "have failed to provide convincing evidence that the process works as originally hoped ( see taam & sandquist 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "technically the problem is difficult , requiring full 3d hydrodynamics and a careful treatment of the dissipation processes .",
    "however there appear to be problems at a more basic level , which are manifest when we consider the most popular parametrization of ce ( e.g. webbink 1984 ) .",
    "this compares the envelope binding energy with the change in orbital energy as @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the giant mass , @xmath2 its radius , @xmath3 its core mass , @xmath4 its envelope mass , @xmath5 is the accretor mass ( assumed fixed during ce evolution ) and @xmath6 are the initial and final binary separations .",
    "stellar structure calculations specify the dimensionless parameter @xmath7 , which is often taken as a constant , e.g. @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a dimensionless efficiency parameter .",
    "clearly only the combination @xmath10 is important .",
    "the problem which emerges is that in many cases the post  ce orbital separation @xmath11 is too large , i.e. there was too little orbital energy release to unbind the giant envelope",
    ". formally this problem appears in the requirement @xmath12 ( values @xmath13 are not unknown ) .",
    "nelemans & tout ( 2005 ) show that these problems are still worse when considering the formation of double white dwarf binaries , where it is possible to reconstruct the state of the progenitor binaries .",
    "the required values of @xmath10 are actually negative in most cases .",
    "all these difficulties point to the need for an extra source of energy to unbind the giant envelope .",
    "a clue to this energy source comes from an observed case which ce evolution clearly can not produce . the low  mass x ",
    "ray binary cyg x2 consists of a neutron star accreting from a low  mass donor ( @xmath14 0.50.7@xmath15 ) in a 9.8d orbit ( see king & ritter 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the donor has radius @xmath16 , and its effective temperature implies luminosity @xmath17 .",
    "evidently this star was considerably more massive in the recent past and we are now seeing its luminous inner layers before they cool .",
    "but the current binary period of 9.8  d makes the binary so wide that far too little orbital energy was available to unbind the envelope , regardless of how wide the pre  ce separation @xmath18 was .",
    "however in this case the required extra energy source is clear . assuming that mass transfer began when the donor was the more massive star and still predominantly radiative , mass flowed towards the neutron star on a thermal timescale @xmath19yr , giving a transfer rate @xmath20yr@xmath21 .",
    "this is clearly highly super  eddington .",
    "king & ritter ( 1999 ) were able to suggest a plausible evolutionary sequence leading to the current state of cyg x2 by assuming that the neutron star accreted only at the eddington rate , the remaining transferred mass being ejected from the system with the specific angular momentum of the neutron star .",
    "podsiadlowski & rappaport ( 2000 ) similarly found a believable evolutionary history for the system starting from a somewhat less evolved donor .",
    "the crucial step in understanding cyg x2 is to assume that the accretion energy of some of the transferred matter can eject the remainder , without the system entering ce evolution .",
    "although earlier papers considered the possibility of using accretion energy in this way ( cf han & webbink 1999 ) they always concluded that the radiatively driven outflow would be dense and extended enough to act as a surrogate envelope for the accretor , and lead back to ce evolution . however king & begelman ( 1999 ) argued that ce evolution would only occur if a sufficiently dense region of the gas flow on to the accretor overfilled the latter s roche lobe .",
    "they identified the boundary of this dense region as the trapping radius @xmath22 where the accretion flow first reaches its local eddington limit ( @xmath23 is the eddington rate at the accretor radius @xmath24 , see below ) overfilled the accretor s roche lobe .",
    "the trapping radius is effectively identical to the spherization radius defined for disc accretion by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , who show that disc accretion at super - eddington rates becomes spherical inside this radius and is a tenuous wind outside it , making it a reasonable estimate for the effective size of any dense envelope ( see also section  [ sect_method ] ) .    on",
    "this basis king & begelman ( 1999 ) showed that systems where a neutron star or black hole accretes from a more massive star would probably always avoid ce evolution provided that the donor was predominantly radiative , i.e. that mass transfer proceeded on a thermal timescale , as in cyg x2 .",
    "this allows values as high as @xmath25 m@xmath26yr@xmath21 , and ss433 is an example of a system in this state ( king , taam & begelman 2000 ; begelman , king & pringle 2006 ) .",
    "king & begelman ( 1999 ) also suggested that such avoidance of ce evolution might apply even to donors which were largely convective , but did not attempt quantitative estimates .    in this paper",
    "we extend the treatment of king & begelman ( 1999 ) to such cases .",
    "we note that the mass transfer rates probably exceed the eddington accretion rate @xmath27 for gravitational energy release on a main sequence star ( here @xmath24 is the radius of the accretor , @xmath28 is the mass of a proton , @xmath29 the speed of light and @xmath30 the thompson scattering cross - section ) .",
    "thus it may be possible to avoid ce evolution even in cases where a red giant overflows on to a main sequence star , as required to form cataclysmic variables .",
    "specifically we investigate here the evolution of systems in which mass transfer occurs from giants on to less massive companions .",
    "we find that the trapping radius of the companion ( where mass accretion reaches the local eddington limit ) is within its roche lobe , so ce evolution may be avoided .",
    "our treatment suggests that a comparison of the fractional change of mass with angular momentum offers a more apt parametrization of the change of orbital separation than the energy formalism ( equation  [ en ] ) .",
    "we note that nelemans & tout ( 2005 ) have proposed such a formalism ( but without an explicit physical reason for the mass loss ) which empirically describes the formation of sub  dwarf b star / white  dwarf and white  dwarf / m  dwarf binaries .",
    "we shall show that our physical treatment gives similar results , thus offering a possible explanation for its success in this case .",
    "we consider donor stars in initial evolutionary states ranging from the start of the hertzsprung gap to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "we define the mass ratio @xmath31 ( normally @xmath32 ) with @xmath33 the donor mass and @xmath5 the accretor mass .",
    "the roche lobe radius ( @xmath34 ) as a function of orbital separation ( @xmath35 ) for the donor is given by eggleton ( 1983 ) @xmath36    for given masses we can find the radius of the donor when it fills its roche lobe at a given initial period ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "using the eggleton stellar evolution code ( eggleton 1971 ; pols et  al . 1998 , and references therein )",
    "we then find the corresponding core mass ( @xmath38 ) of the donor at this radius .",
    "we assume that mass transfer is so rapid that the core mass does not significantly increase during the mass transfer phase .",
    "the instantaneous mass transfer rate is given by tracking the overfilling of the donor s roche lobe as given by paczyski & sienkiewicz ( 1972 ) .",
    "substituting their equation ( 4 ) into their equation ( a26 ) we find @xmath39 where @xmath40 is 0.215 ; @xmath41 is the fractional core - mass of the donor ( @xmath42 ) ; @xmath43 is a function tabulated by paczyski & sienkiewicz ( 1972 ) ; @xmath44 is @xmath45 ; @xmath46 is the difference in stellar radius and roche - lobe radius ( @xmath47 ) of the donor and @xmath48 is given by @xmath49    we let a fraction @xmath50 of the transferred matter be blown away ( cf bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 , who call this fraction @xmath51 ) .",

    "we consider below how much angular momentum this mass carries off .",
    "the trapping radius of the accretor , equation  ( [ etrap ] ) , depends only on the mass transfer rate from the donor . during the evolution",
    "we compare the trapping radius with the roche radius of the accretor found using equation  ( [ eqeggrl ] ) with the mass ratio now inverted . if the trapping radius is greater than the roche lobe we assume that the system enters ce evolution and do not follow its evolution . in the rest of the paper",
    "we show only systems where the trapping radius never overfills the roche lobe .",
    "the resultant change in orbital separation depends on the specific angular momentum of the lost mass .",
    "if the transferred matter forms a disc and mass is lost with circular symmetry from this disc , the appropriate value is the specific angular momentum of the accretor . as the accretor is further from the centre of mass this process shrinks the binary .",
    "however if the transferred matter can not circularize and form a disc , i.e. its circularization radius @xmath69 ( where @xmath60 is the distance of the accretor from the inner lagrange point @xmath70 , cf frank , king & raine 2002 ) is smaller than the trapping radius @xmath71 , the lost matter has specific angular momentum closer to that of @xmath70 .",
    "this follows because , unless a disc forms , the gas stream from the donor effectively conserves its specific angular momentum at a value close to that of @xmath70 ( king , whitehurst & frank 1990 ) .",
    "the donor thus loses matter with specific angular momentum slightly less than its centre of mass , i.e. the donor slightly increases its specific angular momentum .",
    "since the binary mass also drops , this tends to lead to expansion , as equation ( 20 ) of van teeseling & king ( 1998 ) shows .",
    "this of course then makes @xmath72 increase above @xmath71 , creating a stable feedback so that the binary subsequently evolves with @xmath73 .",
    "this occurs particularly in systems with large mass ratios , where most of the transferred matter is lost .",
    "these systems thus do not merge unless the trapping radius exceeds the roche radius of the accretor and a ce phase occurs .    to demonstrate the trapping radius is the boundary of the dense region we compute the density @xmath74 in the outflow from the trapping radius .",
    "this is essentially a spherical wind with constant velocity equal to the escape velocity @xmath75 from the trapping radius .",
    "thus @xmath76 now using ( [ etrap ] ) gives @xmath77 here we use ( [ edd ] ) to replace @xmath78 in the first factor on the rhs , giving @xmath79 or @xmath80 where @xmath81 are @xmath82 in solar units .",
    "( note that eqn [ tau ] reproduces the familiar result that the optical depth through an outflow at the eddington rate is of order unity at the schwarzschild radius , i.e. setting @xmath83 gives @xmath84 . )",

    "this is low enough not to merge , but high enough to form a tight binary .",

    "this evolution is similar to cyg x2 .",
    "applying the results of king & ritter ( 1999 ) with @xmath125 , equation  ( [ eqgammaeff ] ) gives a @xmath109 of 1.2 .",

    "our calculations may offer a physical justification for these parametrizations .",

    "we have studied binary evolution in cases which are normally thought to lead to common  envelope evolution .",
    "we have shown instead that the accretion luminosity is in many cases able to expel much of the super  eddington mass transfer without catastrophic orbital shrinkage .",
    "treatments of ce evolution have hitherto relied on empirical parametrizations ( e.g. webbink 1984 ; nelemans & tout 2005 ) . in cases where these are successful in describing observed systems our theoretical treatment agrees quite well with the adopted parametrizations .",
