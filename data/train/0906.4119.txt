    "zeplin - ii is a dual phase ( gas and liquid ) xe detector designed specifically to identify nuclear recoils induced on xe atoms by the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) ; one of the popular candidates for dark matter in the universe  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the detector is located in the uk boubly underground laboratory which provides about 2800 m water - equalvent shielding for a 10@xmath1 reduction in cosmic muon flux  @xcite .",
    "the central detector was constructed out of low - radioactive materials at ucla , with underground ambient radioactivity carefully studied and modeled at boulby  @xcite .",
    "additional background rejection is afforded by the dual phase design which measures both scintillation and ionization components for each event in the liquid xenon .",
    "since background electron recoils differ from the signal nuclear recoils in the ratio of these components by about a factor of 3 , background rejection can be achieved at @xmath098% efficiency  @xcite .",
    "zeplin - ii detector took data for 31.2 days with 7.2 kg fiducial mass and obtained the final data set reported in ref .",
    "the wimp signal acceptance box is defined between 5 to 20 kev electron - equivalent ( kev@xmath2 ) , encompassing 50% of the total signal region determined by prior calibration runs .",
    "29 events were observed in the acceptance box at the end of first dark matter run .",
    "however , since the acceptance box is flanked on both sides by background events , it is to be expected that some of the events in the box come from the tail distributions of the background events",
    ". a careful analysis of the background distribution was performed , and it was learned that 28.6 @xmath3 4.3 background events were expected in the acceptance box . the detailed analysis and results are documented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and are summarized here .",
    "the background events in the s2/s1@xmath4300 region above the acceptance box are @xmath5 events , as learned from calibration runs with @xmath5 source @xmath6co and americium / beryllium ( ambe ) neutron source . to quantify the event rate distribution , events with energy between 5 to 20 kev@xmath2 were selected and binned according to its log(s2/s1)-k(e ) values , where k(e ) is the 50% nuclear recoil acceptance value of log(s2/s1 ) for the energy of each event . in another words , events with log(s2/s1)-k(e)@xmath70 reside in the acceptance box . the @xmath5 event rate distribution is well characterized by a gaussian with an offset , where the offset accounted for the coincidental events arising from the high trigger rate ( @xmath470 hz ) encountered during calibrations .",
    "these coincidental events were not expected to contribute to the background level in the acceptance box , since they were not observed in the science data , which occurred at a much lower trigger rate ( @xmath42 hz ) . as such , only the gaussian component of the fit is used in background estimation , where the gaussian is scaled to the overall event count in the science data and integrated up to the 50% nuclear recoil boundary . in total ,",
    "16.1 @xmath3 2.9 @xmath5 events were estimated to be in the acceptance box between 5 to 20 kev@xmath2 .",
    "+ the second background events found below the acceptance box were nuclear recoil events with diminished s2 originated from radon contamination in saes getter , as confirmed by an dedicated rn measurement . these recoils occurred near the charged ptfe walls which stripped some of the charges from the electron cloud that constituted s2 .",
    "the diminished s2 subsequently lowered the position reconstruction accuracy , which resulted in a fraction of these events being wrongly placed within the fiducial volume . to quantify the number of misplaced events ,",
    "a distribution of reconstructed radii of all events within the acceptance regions in ( s2/s1)-energy parameter space was studied .",
    "this distribution is well fitted with a gaussian and is extrapolated into the fiducial volume . finally the extrapolated distribution is integrated to give the expected number of radon - related events , which is 12.5 @xmath8 2.3 .",
    "refer to table  [ expectation ] for a summary of background estimation .",
    ".overall expectation values in the nuclear recoil acceptance window compared to observed counts .",

    "4 .   heavier target nuclei are even more favored . while it is true that in the elastic case heavier target nuclei gives rises to a higher differential event rate , inelastic scattering favors heavier target more since @xmath20 is lowered significantly for heavier elements .",
