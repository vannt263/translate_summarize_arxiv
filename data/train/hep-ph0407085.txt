    "recently , several experimental collaborations reported on nonvanishing single - spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in hard processes involving a target with a nonnegligible percentage of transverse polarization @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "historically , the first discussion about transverse - spin effects in high - energy physics goes back to the late seventies , when an anomalous large transverse polarization of the @xmath1 produced in @xmath2 annihilations was measured , surviving even at large values of transverse momentum @xmath3",
    "@xcite . such an observation requires a nonvanishing imaginary part in the off - diagonal part of the fragmentation matrix of quarks into @xmath1 , which is forbidden in qcd at leading twist and appears as a @xmath4 effect  @xcite .",
    "a pioneering work soon appeared  @xcite about the possibility of having leading - twist asymmetries in fully polarized drell - yan processes , but it was basically ignored for almost a decade upon the prejudice that transverse - spin effects have to be suppressed .",
    "the above quoted recent observations warn us about two fundamental issues .",
    "first of all , even the leading - order ( transverse ) spin structure of the nucleon ( and of hadrons , in general ) is far from being fully understood .",
    "secondly , ssa signal the appearance of effects that can not be explained by perturbative qcd , because they are essentially related to a correlation between the polarization and the nonperturbative intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks , as well as to their orbital motion inside the parent hadron .",
    "such features can coexist in objects linked to processes flipping the quark helicity and/or describing residual interactions between the quark and the surrounding hadronic matter , such that the invariance upon time - reversal does not put any constraint . in common jargon ,",
    "the first group is made of chiral - odd functions , since at leading twist chirality and helicity are identical@xcite ; qcd does preserve helicity , so these functions pertain the `` soft '' domain where the chiral symmetry of qcd is ( spontaneously ) broken .",
    "the most important one is a parton density related to the distribution of the transverse polarization of quarks in transversely polarized hadrons .",
    "it is a leading - twist parton distribution function ( pdf ) , therefore necessary to complete the knowledge of the partonic spin structure of hadrons , but it escaped notice so far because of its chiral - odd nature , which prevents it from being extracted in most common processes like inclusive deep - inelasitc scattering ( dis )  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : h1 ] , i will briefly review its main properties ( for a more thorough review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the second group of functions is named , in jargon , t - odd : it does not mean a violation of the fundamental law of nature , it simply indicates that the above mentioned residual interactions prevent the time - reversal operation to put any constraint on such functions . nevertheless , for several years",
    "a common prejudice prevented people from recognizing the existence of such objects both as pdf and parton fragmentation functions ( pff ) , and led them to reject the possibility of asymmetries in processes like @xmath5 because of the violation of invariance under time - reversal transformations .",
    "the above mentioned recent observation of such an asymmetry clearly contradicts such prejudice .",
    "the most famous example of t - odd functions is the collins function  @xcite , that i will recall in sec .",
    "[ sec : collins ] together with other similar objects , the interference fragmentation functions ( iff )  @xcite .",
    "the rich scenario depicted above , obtained by releasing some of the contraints introduced by standard perturbative qcd , lead to even more `` exotic '' , but useful , conclusions .",
    "in fact , the existence of chiral - odd and/or t - odd pdf ( pff ) allows for the description of the polarization state of quarks irrespectively of the polarization state of the parent hadron ; it is then truly possible to perform spin physics without using polarized targets . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dy ] , i will recall how the combination of unpolarized and polarized drell - yan processes , particularly involving antiprotons , can help us in disentangling the unknown pdf and pff occurring elsewhere , like in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) or proton annihilation . in the last section , sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] , i will explicitly show some monte - carlo simulations for such drell - yan processes in the kinematics of interest for the gsi - hesr future facility .",
    "at leading twist , three pdf are needed to describe the partonic spin structure of the nucleon . the easiest and most intuitive way to see",
    "it is to expand the pdf on the quark - nucleon helicity basis  @xcite , @xmath6 \\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : pdf - hel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath7 are the momentum and helicity distributions , which are well known experimentally and have a clear probabilistic interpretation .",
    "the function @xmath8 is not diagonal in the helicity basis ; it mixes different helicity ( hence , chirality ) states and , therefore , it is suppressed in one of the simplest measurable processes , the inclusive dis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dis ] ) . for this reason it escaped notice until recently .",
    "but it is a fundamental piece of infomation about the nucleon spin structure , with the same dignity as the other two pdf .",
    "in fact , by changing from the helicity to the transverse spin basis , the role of @xmath9 and @xmath8 is interchanged ; now , @xmath8 is diagonal and can be interpreted as the probability to find a quark with its spin polarized along the transverse spin of a polarized nucleon minus the probability to find it polarized oppositely  @xcite . in the following , i will switch to the more common notations of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the three pdf discussed above : @xmath12 will always indicate unpolarized partons , while by @xmath13 i mean their longitudinal and transverse polarization , respectively ; finally , the index @xmath14 indicates that these pdf happen at leading twist . the situation is graphically summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1g1h1 ] .",
    "+    contrary to the other two pdf , the transversity @xmath11 does not have a counterpart in the quark parton model ( qpm ) at the level of dis structure function , because of its chiral - odd nature .",
    "even if it depends on spin , it is not related to a partonic fraction of the nucleon spin , because the related twist-2 operator is not part of the full angular momentum tensor .",
    "the first moment of @xmath15 , for a quark with flavor @xmath12 in a nucleon state @xmath16 with momentum @xmath17 and spin @xmath18 , is called the tensor charge , i.e. @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2s^i \\delta q^f ( q^2 ) \\ , \\sim \\ , \\frac{1}{(\\log q^2)^\\gamma } \\ ; , \\label{eq : tens - ch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because it is related to the tensor operator @xmath20 ; it has a nonvanishing anomalous dimension @xmath21 and , therefore , from a renormalization scale @xmath22 it evolves unavoidably to zero  @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "the nonsinglet axial charge @xmath23 is directly related to the nucleon axial charge @xmath24 so that the corresponding distribution @xmath25 truly describes the quark helicity as a fraction of the nucleon s one .",
    "the other big difference can be read from eq .",
    "[ eq : tens - ch ] , namely the transversity for the antiquark enters with an opposite sign such that @xmath26 is odd under charge conjugation operations , contrary to @xmath27 .",
    "this means that , under evolution , @xmath11 does not mix with charge - even structures like the @xmath28 pairs from the dirac sea .",
    "if we now realize that @xmath26 can not mix also with gluonic operators , which are both chiral- and charge - even in a spin @xmath29 hadron , we come to the conclusion that the transversity has very peculiar evolution properties : each moment does depend on the scale @xmath22 , but the function evolves homogeneously with @xmath22 like a pure nonsinglet structure function , completely decoupled from gluons and @xmath28 pairs  @xcite .",
    "it is probably the best place to explore the valence quark content of the nucleon and to test models based on the concept of constituent quark .    from eq .",
    "[ eq : pdf - hel ] it is evident that @xmath30 is associated to the operator @xmath31 while @xmath11 to @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 by a rotation in the spin space around @xmath34 ) . since in the nonrelativistic framework spin and space operations ( euclidean boosts , etc",
    ".. ) commute , we easily get @xmath35 , as it is also graphically intuitive from fig .  [",
    "fig : f1g1h1 ] .",
    "therefore , any deviation from this equality will tell us about the relativistic nature of quark motion in the nucleons , as much as the nonrelativistic prediction @xmath36 deviates from the experimental value of @xmath37  @xcite .    finally , from the positivity of probability distributions we get @xmath38 while from the quark distribution matrix of eq .",
    "[ eq : pdf - hel ] in helicity basis being semi - positive definite , we get the socalled soffer inequality  @xcite , @xmath39 which holds up to next - to - leading order in qcd radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "since the transversity @xmath11 is a chiral - odd pdf happening at leading twist , we need to find a leading - twist chiral - odd partner in order to extract it from the cross section .",
    "there are two possibilities : a polarized drell - yan process where @xmath11 happens in combination with the transversity @xmath40 for an antiquark , or a semi - inclusive process , where @xmath11 is combined with a chiral - odd pff . despite the fact that the extraction of @xmath11 from drell - yan was suggested as first in the literature long time ago  @xcite , we will postpone it to the next sec .",
    "[ sec : dy ] . here in the following",
    ", we will discuss sidis or annihilation processes leading to the collins effect and other interesting phenomena .",
    "+      since we are looking for a semi - inclusive process where transverse polarization is involved at the partonic level , we are naturally led to select a final state with a transversely polarized hadron .",

    "several models are available in the literature ( for example , see ref .",

    "unfortunately , in a nlo simulation @xmath135 turns out to be suppressed by the soffer inequality and qcd evolution  @xcite , and , moreover , it involves the transversity of an antiquark in a transversely polarized proton .",
    "the latter difficulty could be overcome at future gsi - hesr with polarized antiproton beams , where the asymmetry would involve transversities of valence partons anyway  @xcite .",
    "also the single polarized and unpolarized drell - yan cross sections show interesting combinations at leading twist .",
    "for the @xmath136 process , the leading - twist cross section displays , among others , the following contributions  @xcite : @xmath137 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ... \\sin ( \\phi + \\phi_{_{s_1}})\\ , { \\cal f}\\left [ \\hat{\\bf h}\\cdot { \\bf p}_{_{t_2}}\\ , h_1^f ( x_1,{\\bf p}_{_{t_1}})\\ , \\bar{h}_1^{\\perp f}(x_2,{\\bf p}_{_{t_2 } } ) ... \\right ] \\bigg\\ } \\ ; . \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } \\label{eq : ssady}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term can be isolated by an azimuthal asymmetry similar to the one of the sivers effect , in order to extract @xmath76 and compare it with the result of semi - inclusive processes ( eq .  [ eq : ssa ] ) : the different behaviour of the gauge link operator in sidis and drell - yan processes leads to the interesting conjecture that a possible change of sign could take place , posing a question about the assumed universality of t - odd pdf  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : ssady ] contains the transversity and can be isolated by an asymmetry similar to the collins effect .",
    "however , @xmath11 appears convoluted with a second unknown function , @xmath80 , which also contributes to the ssa for the @xmath5 process .",
    "interestingly , this function contributes also to the unpolarized drell - yan cross section at leading twist  @xcite , i.e. @xmath138 ... \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\quad + \\cos 2\\phi \\ , { \\cal f}\\left [ a({\\bf p}_{_{t_1 } } , { \\bf p}_{_{t_2}})\\ , h_1^{\\perp f}(x_1,{\\bf p}_{_{t_1}})\\ , \\bar{h}_1^{\\perp f}(x_2,{\\bf p}_{_{t_2}})\\right ]   ... \\bigg\\ } \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ & & { } \\label{eq : unpoldy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is some function of the transverse momenta of the annihilating partons .",
    "the crucial remark is that @xmath80 can naturally explain the observed sizeable azimuthal asymmetry in unpolarized drell - yan cross sections .",
    "the most general parametrization of such cross sections at leading order looks like @xmath140 where the data suggest @xmath141 and @xmath142%  @xcite , while the perturbative qcd gives @xmath143 . neither higher twists , nor factorization - breaking terms of nlo contributions are able to justify such a big azimuthal asymmetry  @xcite , while eq .",
    "[ eq : unpoldy ] easily accounts for it because it contains a leading twist term @xmath144 and no contributions @xmath145 . a simple explanation for this feature is the fact that , owing to its probabilistic interpretation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f1tperph1perp ] ) , each @xmath80 carries one unit of quark orbital angular momentum @xmath146 , introducing then a cosinusoidal dependence on twice the azimuthal angle @xmath129 .    in conclusion",
    ", the unpolarized drell - yan process allows for the extraction of a chiral - odd t - odd pdf , @xmath80 , that can help in disentangling the transversity @xmath11 in the corresponding single - polarized drell - yan process and , in turn , to compare it with the one that can be extracted in sidis or annihilation processes .",
    "even unpolarized observables can contribute to the study of spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "if beams of protons and antiprotons are used , as it will be at gsi - hesr , the drell - yan azimuthal asymmetries will not be suppressed by nonvalence - like contributions .",
    "in this section , some monte - carlo simulations are presented for the unpolarized and single - polarized drell - yan azimuthal asymmetries , involving proton and antiproton beams with the kinematical conditions discussed in the assia proposal  @xcite . very briefly , the considered process is @xmath147 with an antiproton beam of @xmath148 gev .",
    "the proton target is obtained by a @xmath149 target with a dilution factor of @xmath150 .",
    "when the target is polarized , a further 85% reduction is applied .",
    "the center - of - mass energy is @xmath151 and @xmath152 for the invariant mass @xmath153 gev .",
    "finally , we have @xmath154 for the invariant fraction of total longitudinal momentum with respect to the maximum available longitudinal momentum for the system of annihilating partons .",
    "the simulation consists of 480.000 events distributed according to the cross section @xmath155 all the variables are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyframe ] and @xmath3 is the transverse momentum of the lepton pair . the latter is cut below 1 gev@xmath156 as well as the invariant mass of the muon pair , namely @xmath157 gev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcout ] , the left panel shows the cross section of eq .",
    "[ eq : mcxsect ] for @xmath158 and binned in @xmath159 with positive and negative @xmath160 .",
    "the corresponding azimuthal asymmetry is shown in the right panel , which is proportional to @xmath161 and is parametrized according to ref .",
    "the obtained asymmetry around 5% seems measurable .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcout1 ] the same simulation in the same conditions is applied to the cross section of eq .",
    "[ eq : mcxsect ] with @xmath162 and with different factorized behaviours for @xmath163 : upward triangles for @xmath164 , squares for @xmath165 , downward triangles for @xmath166 . the function @xmath167 is cancelled in the ratio of cross sections defining the azimuthal asymmetry ; therefore , it needs not to be specified .",
    "the @xmath159 dependences represent three different `` wild guesses '' for the factorized ratio @xmath168 that appears in the asymmetry at leading twist . despite the adopted crude approximations ,",
    "the azimuthal asymmetry is sensitive enough to distinguish between these three choices , giving at the same time an average measurable result of around 5% .    in conclusion ,",
    "monte - carlo simulations running antiproton beams on ( polarized ) proton targets at the kinematics of the assia proposal at the gsi - hesr facility , seem to produce a reasonable number of drell - yan events , such that an average 5% azimuthal asymmetry is observed using realistic cut - offs and a sample of almost half million of events .",
