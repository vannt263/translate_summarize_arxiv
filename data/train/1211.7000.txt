    "this is the second part of the three part mathematical study on acoustic wave propagation in a narrow , tubular 3d domain @xmath0 .",
    "the other parts of the work are @xcite .",
    "our current interest in wave guide dynamics stems from modelling of acoustics of speech production ; see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to give a rigorous treatment of solvability and energy passivity / conservativity questions of the two models for wave propagations that are discussed in detail in @xcite : these are ( i ) the boundary controlled wave equation on a tubular domain , and ( ii ) the generalised webster s horn model that approximates the wave equation in low frequencies .",
    "the _ a  posteriori _ error estimate for the webster s model is ultimately given in @xcite , and it is in an essential part based on theorems  [ websternodethm ] and [ ndimwaveconsthm ] below .    the secondary purpose of this paper is to introduce the new notion of _ conservative majoration _ for passive boundary control systems .",
    "the underlying systems theory idea is simple and easy to explain : it is to be expected on engineering and physical grounds that adding energy dissipation to a forward time solvable ( i.e. , internally well - posed , typically even conservative ) system can not make the system ill - posed , e.g. , unsolvable in forward time direction .",
    "thus , it should be enough to treat mathematically only the lossless conservative case that `` majorates '' all models where dissipation is included as far as we are not reversing the arrow of time .",
    "that this intuition holds true for many types of energy dissipation is proved in theorem  [ firstconservativemajorationthm ] for boundary dissipation and in theorem  [ secondconservativemajorationthm ] for a class of dissipation terms for pde s .",
    "these theorems are given in the general context of _ boundary nodes _ that have been discussed in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "early work concerning webster s equation can be found in @xcite .",
    "webster s original work @xcite was published in 1919 , but the model itself has a longer history spanning over 200 years and starting from the works of d.  bernoulli , euler , and lagrange .",
    "more modern approaches is provided by @xcite .",

    "theory point of view , this is a serious restriction since it is obviously impossible to connect finitely many , disjoint , smooth domains seamlessly to each other without leaving holes whose interior is non - empty .",

    "* section  5 ) for webster s horn model .",
    "theorems  [ websternodethm ] and [ ndimwaveconsthm ] treat the questions of unique solvability , passivity , and regularity of the two wave propagation models in the exactly same form as these results are required in companion papers @xcite .",
    "the strict passivity ( i.e. , the case @xmath8 ) in theorems  [ websternodethm ] and [ ndimwaveconsthm ] could be proved without resorting to theorems  [ firstconservativemajorationthm ] and [ secondconservativemajorationthm ] as they both concern single pde s with simple dissipation models . however , the direct approach becomes technically quite cumbersome if we have more complicated aggregated systems to treat ( not all of which need be defined by pde s ) , and combinations of various dissipation models are involved .",
    "an example of such systems is provided by _ transmission graphs _ as introduced in @xcite where the general passive case is treated by reducing it to the conservative case and arguing as in theorem  [ secondconservativemajorationthm ] . in the context of transmission graphs , see also the literature on port - hamiltonian systems @xcite . that the conservative majoration method can not be used for all possible dissipation terms",
