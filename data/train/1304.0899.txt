    "alice ( a large ion collider experiment ) is a general - purpose heavy - ion detector at the cern lhc ( large hadron collider ) .",
    "it has been designed in order to fulfill the requirements to track and identify particles from very low ( @xmath5100  mev/@xmath6 ) up to quite high ( @xmath5100  gev/@xmath6 ) transverse momenta in an environment with large charged - particle multiplicities as in the case of central lead - lead ( pb  pb ) collisions at the lhc .    ;    the alice experiment , shown in figure  [ fig : alice ] , consists of a central - barrel detector and several forward detector systems .",
    "the central system covers the mid - rapidity region ( @xmath13 0.9 ) over the full azimuthal angle .",
    "it is installed inside a large solenoidal magnet providing a moderate magnetic field of 0.5 t. it includes a six - layer high - resolution inner - tracking system ( its ) , a large - volume time - projection chamber ( tpc ) and electron and charged - hadron identification detectors which exploit transition - radiation ( trd ) and time - of - flight ( tof ) techniques , respectively .",
    "small - area systems for high-@xmath0 particle - identification ( hmpid ) , photon and neutral - meson measurements ( phos ) and jet reconstruction ( emcal ) complement the central barrel .",
    "thanks to these unique features the experiment is able to identify hadrons in a wide momentum range by employing different detection systems and techniques , as discussed in section  [ sec : pid ] .",
    "the detectors which cover larger rapidity regions include a single - arm muon spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity range -4.0 @xmath14 -2.4 and several smaller detectors ( vzero , tzero , fmd , zdc , and pmd ) for triggering , multiplicity measurements and centrality determination .",
    "a detailed description of the alice detector layout and of its subsystems can be found in  @xcite .    since november 2009 when the first collisions at the lhc occurred , the alice experiment has collected proton - proton data at several centre - of - mass energies ( @xmath9 = 0.9 , 2.76 , 7 and 8 tev ) . during the first two lhc heavy - ion runs , in 2010 and 2011 ,",

    "it is worth stressing the outstanding performance of the lhc complex : the instant luminosity exceeded @xmath16 in the second run , higher than the design value .",
    "proton - lead ( p  pb ) collision data were also collected with the alice detector .",
    "this occurred during a short run performed in september 2012 in preparation for the main p ",
    "pb run at the beginning of 2013 .",
    "eight pairs of bunches collided in the alice interaction region , providing a luminosity of about @xmath17 .",
    "the configuration ( 4 tev protons colliding with fully stripped @xmath18pb ions at @xmath19 tev ) resulted in interactions at @xmath10 = 5.02 tev in the nucleon - nucleon centre - of - mass system , which moves with a rapidity of @xmath20 = 0.465 .",

    "the its is the innermost detector system , a six - layer silicon detector located at radii between 4 and 43 cm .",
    "four of the six layers provide specific energy loss d@xmath7/d@xmath8 measurements and are used for particle identification in the non - relativistic ( @xmath22 ) region . by using the its as a standalone tracker it is possible to reconstruct and identify low - momentum particles ( below  200  mev / c ) not reaching the main tracking systems ( figure  [ fig : pid ] top - left ) .",

    "@xmath23d@xmath7/d@xmath24 the particle type can be determined by comparing the measurements with the bethe - bloch expectation ( figure  [ fig : pid ] top - right ) .",
    "the tof detector is a large - area array of multigap resistive plate chambers ( mrpc ) and covers the central pseudorapidity region ( @xmath25  0.9 , full azimuth ) .",
    "particle identification is performed by matching momentum and trajectory - length measurements performed by the tracking system with the time - of - flight information provided by the tof system .",
    "the overall time - of - flight resolution is measured to be about 85  ps in pb  pb collisions ( about 120  ps in pp collisions ) and it is determined by the time resolution of the detector itself and by the start - time resolution ( figure  [ fig : pid ] bottom - left ) .",
    "the hmpid detector consists of seven identical proximity focusing rich ( ring imaging cherenkov ) counters .",
    "photon detection is performed using the proportional multiwire chambers coupled to pad - segmented csi photocathode .",
    "particle identification is obtained by means of the measurement of the cherenkov angle allowing the separation of pions and kaons between 1 gev/@xmath6 and 3 gev/@xmath6 and protons from 1.5 gev/@xmath6 up to 5 gev/@xmath6 ( figure  [ fig : pid ] ) .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra of primary @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are measured at mid - rapidity ( @xmath4 ) combining the techniques and detectors described above .",
    "primary particles are defined as prompt particles produced in the collision and all decay daughters , except products from weak decays of strange particles . the contribution from the feed - down of weakly - decaying particles to @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 and from protons emitted from secondary interactions with material",
    "are subtracted by fitting the data using monte carlo templates of the dca distributions ( figure  [ fig : dca ] ) .",
    "particles can also be identified in alice via their characteristics decay topology or invariant mass .",
