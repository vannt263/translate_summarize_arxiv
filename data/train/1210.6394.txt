    "the gas located on 1  1000 pc scale from the center of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) plays a role in several important processes , which are not well understood .",
    "this gas is the source of agn fuel , and may absorb agn energy and momentum output , thus potentially coupling the growth of the bulge with the growth of the central black hole .",
    "it is enriched during the life cycle of stars near the nucleus , and therefore traces the star formation history .",
    "it also reprocesses the agn ionization continuum , which originates from a few schwarzschild radii , and thus its emission may allow to constrain the accretion mode in the innermost regions .    the most prominent optical signature of the circumnuclear gas in agn is its emission lines , which have widths typical of the galaxy potential ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these lines are known as the narrow emission lines , and the emitting region as the narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "the vast majority of nlr analyses were performed on type 2 agn where the central source is obscured , partly because the narrow lines are not blended with the broad emission lines , which dominate the emission features in unobscured type 1 agn .",
    "most previous studies of the nlr of type 1 agn were either limited to the most prominent forbidden lines ( e.g. boroson & green 1992 , using  @xmath5 ) , limited to small samples ( e.g. baldwin , phillips & terlevich 1981 , hereafter bpt , cohen 1983 , ho et al .",

    "a measurement of narrow line luminosities of a large sample of type 1 agn , including luminous quasars , was performed by zhang et al .",
    "they found that the narrow line luminosity ratio @xmath6}}\\lambda 6583 / { \\text{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] of type 1 agn is offset to lower values than in type 2 agn .",
    "here we significantly expand their work , by studying the nlr properties of a large sample of 3175 type 1 agn , hereafter the t1 sample , defined in stern & laor ( 2012a , hereafter paper i ) with minor adjustments detailed below .",
    "the t1 sample spans a black hole mass range of @xmath7 and a bolometric luminosity range of @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast with studies of type 2 agn , here the agn is unobscured .",
    "we use the narrow line measurements , combined with the agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and broad line measurements , to address the following questions :    _ how complete is the bpt classification of agn ? _ the bpt diagrams ( bpt and veilleux and osterbrock 1987 , hereafter vo ) compare the ratio of the  to  luminosity ( for brevity / ) , with @xmath6}}\\lambda 6583/{\\text{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] , @xmath9}}(\\lambda\\lambda 6716 , 6731)/{\\text{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] , and @xmath10}}(\\lambda 6300)/{\\text{h$\\alpha$}}$ ] .",
    "these line ratios provide a measure of the relative strength of the higher energy ionizing photons , and thus differentiate between stellar and agn excitation .",
    "these diagrams are widely used to define type 2 agn samples , using separation lines based on theoretical models ( kewley et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter ke01 ) , and based on the observed distribution of star forming galaxies ( kauffmann et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter ka03 ) .",
    "the bpt / vo agn selection criteria are commonly viewed as necessary and sufficient conditions to define agn .",
    "however , agn samples selected by other means show these selection criteria may not be necessary conditions . in a hard x - ray selected sample , a unique signature for agn emission , winter et al .",

    "39% of the objects are sfs or composites .",
    "this fraction dropped to 18% when the spectra was taken from a narrower slit ( xiao et al .",
    "on the other hand , only 3% of radio loud agn are classified as composites or sfs ( buttiglione et al . 2010 ) . using the t1 sample , which is selected independently of the narrow line properties , we derive the completeness of the bpt - based selection criteria , and its dependence on the agn emission properties .    _",

    "the matched groups are constructed by randomly selecting 14 pure - agn t1 objects with the same @xmath0 ( up to 0.1 dex ) , for each composite or sf ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the geometrical mean @xmath45 of the composites is 0.27 , compared to 0.12 in the matched pure - agn .",
    "therefore , the @xmath45 ratios of composites are consistent with a roughly equal agn and host contribution to @xmath46 . in the robust sfs ,",

    "an intermediate ratio is seen in the non - robust sfs .",
    "a similar effect is expected in @xmath47 , as star formation will contribute only to @xmath22 .",

    "star forming galaxies have a mean @xmath48 ( kennicutt & evans 2012 ) .",

    ", the t1 agn which reside in the composites and sf regions of the bpt diagrams , also show higher @xmath47 and @xmath45 ratios , compared to pure - agn .",

    "could host contamination also affect line ratios within the pure - agn regime ? could some of the spread in the bpt diagrams , also within the pure - agn regime , be caused by host contamination ?",
    "figure 11 presents the mean bpt positions of t1s binned by @xmath47 .",
    "we split the t1 sample to @xmath51 ( upper panels ) , and @xmath52 ( lower panels ) .",

    "objects within the @xmath55 bins have similar mean positions , but the @xmath56 bin is shifted towards the composite region .",
    "the highest bin here has @xmath57 , and its mean position is within the composite region .",
    "thus , not only that composite agn have a higher mean @xmath47 , as found earlier , also the highest @xmath47 agn are on average composite in nature .",
    "therefore , the excess uv , seen in low luminosity agn , likely arises from star formation in the host , as suggested in paper i , based on a comparison of their sed to the pure agn sed .",
    "in addition , agn within the ` pure - agn ' bpt regime can also be affected by host contamination , in particular when getting close to the ke06 line .",
    "narrow emission lines , powered purely by accretion , likely produces a smaller dispersion than observed in the bpt plots .",
    "what produces the scatter in the bpt plots ?",
    "possible parameters are the ionizing spectral slope and the ionization parameter ( e.g. groves et al . 2004 ) .",
    "below we test this explanation by exploring the dependence of the bpt positions on @xmath23 , the power law slope interpolated from @xmath22 and @xmath21 .",
    "we use the 752 t1 objects that were observed by galex and have @xmath58 , to avoid host contamination of the uv .",
    "we note that this luminosity cut limits the agn luminosity dynamical range to @xmath59 .",

    "figure 12 shows the mean bpt-  positions of the different @xmath23 bins .",
    "error bars denote the error in the mean position .",
    "we use the bpt-  panel since it is most sensitive to the ionizing slope ( groves et al .",

    "the uv detection rate is 60% for the @xmath61 bin , and @xmath62 in the other bins .",
    "upper limits are used when a detection is not available , so the true @xmath23 of the @xmath63 bin is likely @xmath64 , while the true @xmath23 of the @xmath61 bin is likely @xmath65 .    .",
    "the solid , dashed and dashed - dot classification lines are as in figure 2 . to avoid host contamination of @xmath22 , only t1 objects with",
    "@xmath58 are used ( gray dots ) .",
    "the mean position of each @xmath23 bin is marked by a triangle ( mean @xmath23 noted ) , with error bars denoting the error in the mean position .",
    "for comparison , the expected bpt position for ionizing spectra with different slopes and different @xmath66 are marked ( values from groves et al .",
    "the mean bpt positions of the t1 objects do not follow the trend expected if the slope of the ionizing spectrum is @xmath23 , indicating that either @xmath23 does not represent the euv spectral slope observed by the nlr , or other parameters , such as metallicity , ionization and density control the position . ]",
    "we note that the known trend of @xmath23 vs. agn luminosity ( e.g. just et al .",
    "2007 ) implies a range of @xmath67 in the mean @xmath23 over the luminosity range spanned by the objects shown in figure 12 ( see fig . 20 in paper i ) .",
    "therefore , the observed range of @xmath68 in @xmath23 in these objects is not dominated by the global trend with agn luminosity .",

    "clearly , the observed mean position is independent of the mean observed @xmath23 , in sharp contrast with the models which predict a strong dependence .",
    "this discrepancy may indicate that at a given luminosity , the spread in @xmath23 does not reflect a spread in the ionization slope at the euv .",
    "the dispersion in the bpt plots is produced by another parameter , such as @xmath71 , ionization parameter and the nlr density .",
    "telfer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the mean euv slope of @xmath72 quasars , observed by hst , is consistent with the mean @xmath23 of quasars with the same luminosity , confirming previous results by laor et al .",
    "therefore , the mean euv slope and mean @xmath23 do seem to coincide .",
    "however , figure 12 suggests that this equality does not extended to individual agn . there may exist additional mechanisms which produces a dispersion in @xmath23 with no effect on the bpt positions .",
    "for example , variability on timescales shorter than the nlr light crossing time ( @xmath73 yrs )",
    ". however , vagnetti et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that variability on timescales of up to one year accounts only for 30  40% of the scatter in @xmath23 at a given agn luminosity .",
    "another source for a dispersion in @xmath23 is absorption restricted to our line of sight .",
    "a dusty absorber will flatten @xmath23 , as the dust optical absorption opacity is significantly larger than the x - ray absorption opacity ( e.g. laor & draine 1993 ) , while a dustless absorber will absorb only the x - ray and will steepen @xmath23 , as commonly seen in broad absorption line quasars ( e.g. brandt et .",
    "al . 2000 ) .",
    "an absorber restricted to our line of sight will not significantly affect the nlr emission , and thus the bpt position will remain unchanged .",
    "a third option is an absorber located outside the nlr , so the nlr sees the intrinsic ionizing spectrum , and the bpt ratios are not affected . in the next section",
    "we show that such a distant dusty absorber does exist in agn .",
    "some agn appear to be dust reddened based on their sed ( e.g. richards et al . 2003 ) . in paper",
    "i , we found that the @xmath47 distribution at the high luminosity end of the t1 sample is at least partially due to dust reddening along the line of sight .",
    "in particular , objects with @xmath74 show a correlation such that redder optical slopes go with a decreasing @xmath47 .",
    "a possible correlation between the reddening and @xmath75 suggested that this dust resides on host galaxy scales , beyond the nlr .",
    "this suggestion can now be tested using figure 11 , which shows the mean bpt positions by @xmath47 .",
    "the mean positions of the @xmath76 bins are all similar to each other , in both high luminosity t1s ( lower row ) and low luminosity t1s ( upper row ) . if the dust resides inside the nlr , then the nlr in objects with a low @xmath47 is illuminated by a modified ionizing sed , which will shift their mean bpt position .",
    "the complete lack of a trend in bpt position with reddening suggests that the nlr illumination is not modified , and therefore the extincting dust resides on scales larger than the nlr .",
    "the narrow line ratios of type 2 agn have been extensively explored , in particular based on the sdss sample . here",
    "we present a similar analysis of the t1 sample , a large ( 3175 objects ) sample of type 1 agn ( paper i ) .",
    "the t1 sample extends to luminosities well below the sdss quasar sample , and thus in contrast with quasars , where the narrow lines are generally difficult to measure , here a significant fraction of the objects have strong narrow lines ( paper ii ) .",
    "this allows reliable analysis of the narrow line ratios for most objects , as done in type 2 agn .",
    "we find the following :    1 .",
    "the luminosities of all measured narrow lines , , , , , , , show a baldwin relation relative to the broad  luminosity , @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , respectively ( paper ii , and above ) .",
    "2 .   about 20% of the t1 agn have line ratios within the ` composite ' and ` sf ' regions of the bpt diagrams .",
    "these line ratios are not powered by accretion onto a massive bh , as these objects also show higher @xmath45 and @xmath47 emission .",
    "the excess @xmath46 and @xmath22 is consistent with the ratio expected from sf in the host galaxy , and indicates the line emission in these objects is mostly excited by sf , rather than by the agn .",
    "3 .   the other 80% of the t1 agn , which reside within the bpt agn region ,",
    "are offset to lower /  and /  luminosity ratios , compared to type 2 agn .",
    "this offset is a selection effect , as t1 agn selected only from the sdss galaxy sample , as the type 2 agn are , are not offset .",
    "the offset is produced by the t1 point like objects , selected from the sdss quasar sample , which extend to higher @xmath79 .",
    "the t2 sample is selected against such objects , and such objects are offset to lower /  and /.",
    "the /  and /  ratios increase with host mass , which suggest a mass - metallicity relation in agn hosts , as observed in quiescent galaxies .",
    "in contrast , /  decreases with @xmath80 , but /  is independent of @xmath80 , which indicates there is no direct @xmath80-metallicity relation .",
    "5 .   at a fixed @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",
    "objects with a higher /  also have higher broad  luminosity , suggesting the broad line metallicity is also related to the host mass .",
    "this may be an additional independent effect to the @xmath3-metallicity relation , suggested in earlier studies to explain some of the eigenvector 1 relations .",
    "the fraction of agn which are liners increases from @xmath81 at @xmath82 to @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "the t1 and t2 samples show a similar fraction at a given @xmath3 , indicating the liner phenomena is unrelated to the presence of an observable blr .",
    "however , the t1 sample terminates at @xmath85 , either due to a physical effect or due to selection effects , and thus liners constitute only @xmath86% of the t1 sample , but @xmath87% of the t2 sample .",
    "the bpt position is unaffected by the value of @xmath47 for values @xmath88 , which provide a measure of the foreground dust extinction ( paper i ) .",
    "this suggests that the ionizing continuum observed at the nlr is unaffected by dust extinction , and the dust likely resides on the host galaxy scale .",
    "the bpt position of @xmath89 agn is unaffected by the observed spread in @xmath23 .",
    "models show there is a strong dependence of the bpt position on the ionizing continuum slope .",
    "this suggests that the scatter in @xmath23 is dominated by mechanisms which do not affect the ionizing slope seen by the nlr , such as absorption along our line of sight , or outside the nlr .",
    "also , this result suggests that parameters other than the ionizing continuum slope , such as metallicity , density , and ionization parameter , dominate the scatter in the bpt plots .",
