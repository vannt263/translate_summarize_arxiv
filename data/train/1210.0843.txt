    "nucleation is a fundamental process , which characterizes the mechanisms of the emergence of a new phase , and this is one of the most widespread ways , by which the phase transitions are initiated .",
    "although a variety of theoretical descriptions for the nucleation exists , all of them are based on the same key idea : new phase starts to evolve within a mother phase from the nuclei , when they achieve such sizes and shapes , which facilitate the further stable growth of these nuclei . according to the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) , the stability of the nuclei is resulted by the confrontation of surface and bulk contributions in a free energy .",
    "this is relevant for the homogeneous scenario , which implies the equal probability for the appearance of a nucleation event over the sample , as well as for the heterogeneous scenario , where the some places in a sample are more attractive for the nucleation events ( due to impurities , walls , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "concerning the specific case of the homogeneous droplet nucleation during the vapor - to - liquid transition in water , there is the comprehensive experimental material due to series of investigations ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) . here , the direct comparison of the experimental results with the predictions of the nucleation theories as well as with the data of the numerical simulations performed by means of molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite and monte carlo @xcite methods has revealed the noticeable discrepancies .",
    "so , for example , for the vapor - to - liquid nucleation in water at the identical conditions ( pressure / supersaturation , temperature ) the experiments , the theoretical models ( cnt and others ) and the numerical simulations yield the values of the steady - state nucleation rate @xmath2 , which differ by orders of magnitude . under these circumstances , it could be quite reasonable to consider the features of the nucleation - growth kinetics in water at the molecular level , treating the vapor - to - liquid transition in the context of molecular interactions and movements .",
    "recently , molinero and moore have suggested a coarse - grained `` monatomic '' model of water ( mw ) , in which the anisotropy in the molecular interactions is simply realizing by means of an angular - dependent contribution  @xcite .",
    "the removal of the atomic interactions from the consideration accelerates the computations and , thereby , it inspires to probe the microscopic properties of the system on the extended time scales . here",
    ", the phase transitions are convenient candidates to be taken in handling .",
    "so , the homogeneous nucleation of ice was studied within the mw - model of water in refs .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to extend these studies and to consider the details of the vapor - to - liquid phase transition on the basis of the mw - model .",
    "an important point is that the mw - model reproduces correctly the equation of state for the temperature range @xmath3 at @xmath4atm .",

    "three principal parameters are enough to restore the basic aspects of the steady - state nucleation .",
    "these can be , for example , the steady - state nucleation rate @xmath2 , the nucleation barrier @xmath5 and the zeldovich factor @xmath6 .",
    "of course , those three parameters can be taken in another combination ( for example , the `` reduced moment '' , the lag - time , and the steady - state nucleation rate , like it is suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , the surface tension @xmath7 , which characterizes the interphase layer and contributes to the nucleation barrier through the surface free energy term , requires the independent treatment  @xcite . in the direct computer simulations , the different adapted convenient approaches based on the fowler formula , the kirkwood - buff formula and others are utilizing to define accurately the surface tension @xcite .",
    "however , there is a necessity at the study of nucleation to apply such a method ( i ) that gives a possibility to estimate the surface tension from the raw simulation data , ( ii ) that is applicable to characterize the surfaces of the microscopical nuclei with a pronounced inherent curvature , and ( iii ) that considers the genuine interphase ( vapor - liquid ) properties without reference to a vacuum phase .    in the present work",
    ", we study the nucleation - growth processes of water droplets on the basis of md simulations with the mw - model . to define the parameters of the nucleation and the droplet growth , we apply the statistical treatment of the simulation data on the basis of the thermodynamic integration scheme and the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) approach .",
    "similar to the thermodynamic integration scheme , the mfpt approach utilizes the time - dependent configurations as resulted from the independent runs under identical conditions , however , the mfpt is focused on the averaged time scales , at which a system characteristic ( reaction coordinate , order parameter ) appears for the first time  @xcite .",
    "we show that the thermodynamic integration scheme and the mfpt method provide a convenient tool to treat the simulation results ( and/or the experimental data ) concerning both the nucleation and the growth kinetics . for the considered case of water",

    "we remark here , this result is not the same with the findings of refs .",

    "@xcite , @xmath199 partilces , and the pronounced deviation from a spherical form can be considered as a signature of the finite size effects : a weak structural rearrangement in such a system raises the significant change of its shape .",
    "the coarse - grained models for particle interactions in molecular systems provide the good opportunity to study early stages of the phase transitions by means of the numerical simulations . in this work ,",
    "the processes of the steady - state homogeneous vapor - to - liquid nucleation and the growth of liquid droplets in water were considered within the mw - model , which treats the molecular interactions excluding any details of the direct oxygen - hydrogen interactions and electrostatics . despite the apparent coarsening in the description of the molecular interactions ,",
    "we have shown that the mw - model provides interesting information concerning the droplet nucleation in water vapor , thereby complementing the simulation results obtained earlier within all - atom models of water such as tip@xmath91p and spc / e  @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to note , the results reported here are obtained on the basis of the extended statistical treatment within the mfpt approach and the thermodynamic integration scheme .",
    "the surface tension of the nucleated droplets was computed within an approximation that is restricted by the consideration of the two - particle interactions only without handling the three - particle contribution to the energy of system .",
    "the obtained values demonstrate the decrease of the surface tension with the temperature growth .",
    "it is necessary to note that the applied numerical scheme gives the higher values for the liquid - vapor surface tension of the droplets in comparison with the values for the liquid - vacuum surface tension of a planar interface reported in ref .",
    "we suppose that this difference is rather a result of the approximations applied to the surface tension definition than the mw - model product .",
    "further , the evaluated values of the steady - state nucleation rate are comparable with the results for all - atom models as well as with the treatments within the classical nucleation theory .",
    "unfortunately , we could not to perform the direct comparison of the obtained nucleation rates with the experimental data , because we found no experimental @xmath2 for the ( @xmath197)-line considered here .",
