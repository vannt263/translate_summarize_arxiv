    "recent observations and modeling of several young supernova remnants ( snrs ) suggest the presence of magnetic fields at the forward shock ( i.e. , the outer blast wave ) well in excess of what is expected from simple compression of the ambient circumstellar field , @xmath3 .",
    "these large fields are inferred from ( i ) spectral curvature in radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( ii ) broad - band fits of synchrotron  emission between radio and non - thermal x - rays ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( iii ) sharp x - ray edges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while these methods are all indirect , fields greater than 500  @xmath4 g  are inferred in cas a and values of at least several 100 @xmath4 g  are estimated in tycho , kepler , sn1006 , and g347.3 - 0.5 . if @xmath5  @xmath4 g , amplification factors of 100 or more may be required to explain the fields immediately behind the forward shocks and this is likely the result of a nonlinear amplification process associated with the efficient acceleration of cosmic - ray ions via diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength is a critical parameter in dsa and also strongly influences the synchrotron  emission from shock accelerated electrons . since shocks are expected to accelerate particles in diverse astrophysical environments and synchrotron  emission is often an important emission process ( e.g. , radio jets ) , quantifying the magnetic field amplification has become an important problem in particle astrophysics and has relevance beyond cosmic - ray production in snrs .    if cosmic - ray  ( cr ) production is as efficient as expected in theories of nonlinear dsa ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cr pressure gradient in the shock precursor can do work on the incoming plasma and , in principle , place a large amount of energy in magnetic turbulence .",
    "in fact , if the dsa process is to work at all , magnetic turbulence must be self - generated on all resonant scale lengths to provide the scattering necessary to drive the particle distribution to isotropy .",
    "if the turbulence remains weak , i.e. , if @xmath6 , the self - generation of turbulence by cr streaming in the shock precursor can be adequately described using quasi - linear theory ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for large amplitude turbulence",
    ", however , this analytic description becomes questionable and less rigorous approximations must be made .    in principle , a complete description of nonlinear  dsa , including magnetic field amplification , is possible with particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations . in reality , however , these simulations are still far too computationally demanding to produce realistic models of astrophysical sources such as supernova remnants .",
    "approximate methods describing nonlinear  dsa must be used . here ,",
    "we have developed a method which incorporates a phenomenological model of particle diffusion and turbulence growth ( similar to * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in a fully nonlinear  monte carlo  model of dsa ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while not a first - principles description of the plasma physics , the computational efficiency of our approach gives it a significant advantage over pic simulations and semi - analytic  techniques based on the diffusion approximation in that we can determine the shock structure , the injection of thermal particles , the acceleration of these particles to relativistic  energies , and the magnetic turbulence , all self - consistently  in a fully nonlinearsteady - state model",
    "an important advantage of the monte carlo  simulation is that , in effect , it solves a more basic set of equations governing the shock structure and dsa than do techniques based on diffusion  convection equations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is no assumption of isotropy for particle distributions and this allows an internally self - consistent  treatment of thermal particle injection .",
    "injection is still phenomenological and depends on the assumptions made for the particle pitch - angle scattering , but these assumptions are applied equally to all particles . since there is only one set of scattering assumptions , the monte carlo  technique eliminates a free `` injection parameter '' which is present in all models based on the diffusion approximation to set the injection efficiency .",
    "as we show , the strong feedback between injection , shock structure , and magnetic field amplification  makes this property of the monte carlo  technique particularly important .",
    "our preliminary results show that magnetic field amplification results in an increase in the maximum cr momentum , @xmath7 , a given shock system can produce compared to the case without amplification . for the case we consider , acceleration truncated by a finite - size shock , this increase is not , however , as large as the increase in @xmath2 in the shocked region since fields on scales of the upstream diffusion length of the highest energy particles strongly influence @xmath7 . furthermore , the fact that @xmath2 ranges smoothly from the unshocked value far upstream , @xmath1 , to the amplified value , @xmath8 , downstream from the shock will have consequences for electrons since radiation losses will be greatest in the downstream region where particles spend a large fraction of their time . and the subshock compression ratio is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the bulk flow speed . ]",
    "thus , the maximum momentum protons and electrons obtain may be determined by two very different field strengths .",
    "we also show that the amplification factor , @xmath11 , increases with alfvn  mach number , that is , for a given shock speed and ambient density , a small @xmath1 will be amplified more than a larger @xmath1 .",
    "the ability to dramatically increase very low ambient fields may make it possible for reverse shocks in young snrs to accelerate particles and produce relativisticelectrons and radio synchrotron  emission ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of dsa at reverse shocks is snrs ) .",
    "the injection and acceleration of electrons in amplified fields will be considered in subsequent work , here , we consider only proton acceleration .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the feasibility of applying monte carlotechniques to dsa with field amplification but have made a number of approximations regarding wave generation and have neglected wave damping .",
    "an important advantage of the monte carlo  method is that it can be generalized to include more realistic descriptions of non - resonant wave growth , linear and nonlinear  damping , and the calculation of the momentum and space dependent diffusion coefficient from the turbulent energy density , and work along these lines is in progress .",
    "while a more accurate description of the plasma physics will influence all aspects of the acceleration process , we expect that @xmath7 will be most strongly determined by the plasma physics details and thus will remain a critical problem for understanding the origin of galactic cosmic rays for some time .",
    "consider a steady - state collisionless shock propagating along a uniform component @xmath12 of a stochastic magnetic field @xmath13 .",
    "we only consider parallel shocks where @xmath12 is along @xmath14 and the shock face is perpendicular to @xmath12 . as",
    "the unshocked plasma approaches the shock and experiences the pressure gradient in the cosmic - ray precursor , the energetic particles backstreaming from the shock cause fluctuations of the field , @xmath15 , to grow . in the linear regime",
    ", @xmath15 is perpendicular to @xmath16 and the local rate of growth of energy in waves is proportional to the particle pressure gradient .",
    "the plasma motion associated with these field fluctuations is initially alfvnic : transverse and incompressible , and it will remain as such as long as @xmath17 .    as the perturbations grow and reach @xmath18 , however , it is likely that waves with wave vectors @xmath19 not aligned with @xmath16 will be generated , due to local cr pressure gradients along the total @xmath20 . with @xmath18",
    ", it becomes impossible to predict the average value of the transverse pressure gradients and the resulting magnetic field structure without knowing the relative phases of different wave harmonics .",
    "the problem is further complicated by the fact that this longitudinal , compressible turbulence may produce a strong second - order fermi particle acceleration effect which , in turn , can damp the longitudinal fluctuations ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "these complications place a precise description of plasma turbulence beyond current analytic capabilities and lead to our goal of obtaining a realistic approximation that includes the essential nonlinear  effects from efficient dsa but still allows particle acceleration over a large dynamic range . in order to accomplish this , we consider two limiting cases .",
    "the first assumes there is no longitudinal turbulence , in which case the wave growth rate is determined by the alfvn  speed in the un - amplified field @xmath1 .",
    "this gives a lower bound to the growth rate .",
    "the upper limit assumes that the turbulence is isotropic , in which case the growth rate is determined by the alfvn  speed in the much larger amplified field @xmath21 ( defined below ) .",
    "the real situation should lie between these two cases and while we consider these limits , we do not explicitly include second - order fermi acceleration in our calculations .",
    "to get an initial estimate of the shock structure , we use a monte carlosimulation of diffusive shock acceleration , assuming that the motion of particles can be described as pitch - angle scattering in the bohm limit .",
    "the monte carlo  simulation provides the distribution of fast particles at all positions relative to the viscous subshock and allows for a calculation of the particle pressure gradient , @xmath22 , which drives the amplification process in the shock precursor .",
    "then , we use @xmath22 to calculate the total energy density in magnetic turbulence , @xmath23 , as a function of position across the shock .",
    "this calculation uses a semi - analytical expression for wavelength - dependent growth of magnetic turbulent energy density @xmath24 , which is similar to the well - known equation for alfvn  wave growth ( e.g. , equation b.8 in * ? ? ?",
    "the complete expression is presented below as equations  ( [ uminuskp ] ) and ( [ upluskp ] ) . the turbulence amplification term in them , which represents",
    "the streaming instability is : @xmath25_\\mathrm{stream } = v_g \\left [ { \\frac{\\partial p_{p}(x , p)}{\\partial x}}\\frac{dp}{dk } \\right ] _ { p=\\bar{p}(k ) } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the particle momentum , @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the momentum of particles resonant with wavevector @xmath29 , and much of the complicated plasma physics is contained in @xmath30 , an unknown growth - rate coefficient with dimensions of speed . once the wave energy density is determined ( as described below ) ,",
    "it is used to calculate an `` effective '' amplified magnetic field , @xmath31 , and this field is then used to calculate the particle diffusion coefficient , @xmath32 , as a function of position and momentum .    for the growth of alfvn  waves in quasi - linear  theory , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the alfvn  speed calculated with the un - amplified field and @xmath35 is the matter density at position @xmath14 . as mentioned above",
    ", taking @xmath33 ignores the transverse gradients of pressure and only the component of the pressure gradient along the initial magnetic field @xmath1 is accounted for .",
    "this choice of @xmath30 provides a lower limit on the amplification rate and was used in @xcite .",
    "if , on the contrary , we define @xmath30 using the amplified field , i.e. , @xmath36 , it reflects the situation where the growth rate is determined by the maximum gradient of @xmath37 along the fluctuating field lines .",
    "this provides an upper limit on the wave growth rate and was used in @xcite .",
    "a similar argument applies to the resonance condition . in order to obtain a solution",
    ", we assume a resonance relation between @xmath29 and @xmath26 even though there is unlikely to be such a simple relation in strong turbulence .",
    "again , we can define two limiting cases where the resonant wavelength for particles of momentum @xmath26 lies between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the gyroradius .",
    "the real situation should lie between the two extremes for @xmath30 and @xmath41 .",
    "for this preliminary work , we set @xmath42 , but vary @xmath30 between the two limits , i.e. , we introduce a parameter , @xmath43 , such that @xmath44   { f_\\mathrm{alf}}\\right \\ } \\ , \\ ] ] and @xmath30 varies linearly between @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 ( for @xmath48 ) .",
    "finally , we assume a bohm model for diffusion .",
    "the mean free path of a particle with momentum @xmath26 at position @xmath14 is taken to be equal to the gyroradius of this particle in the amplified field , i.e. , @xmath49 $ ] , and the diffusion coefficient is then @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the particle speed .",
    "closure of the model is provided by using the newly calculated diffusion coefficient in the monte carlo  simulation , calculating a new shock structure and pressure gradient profile @xmath22 , and iterating until mass , momentum , and energy fluxes are conserved throughout the shock .",
    "the basic monte carlo  ( mc ) simulation used here is described in detail in a number of papers including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model calculates the shock structure and nonlinear  particle spectrum self - consistently , including thermal particle injection .",
    "as mentioned above , injection can be treated self - consistently  in this model because the monte carlo  technique does not require the diffusion approximation and no distinction between thermal and superthermal particles is made . until now , however , in parallel shocks we have assumed a spatially independent form for the diffusion coefficient , i.e. , that the diffusion coefficient , @xmath52 , is proportional to gyroradius : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the particle mean free path , @xmath55 is the gyroradius , and @xmath56 is an arbitrary parameter determining the `` strength '' of scattering .",
    "and @xmath57 vary with @xmath14 as the strength and angle the magnetic field makes with the shock normal vary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "] in fact , we assume @xmath58 and then individual particles pitch - angle scatter with some maximum scattering angle which is set to give the assumed mean free path ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for full details of the pitch - angle scattering process ) .",
    "the monte carlo  simulation obtains the shock structure or bulk flow speed @xmath59 by iteration , ensuring that mass , momentum , and energy fluxes are conserved across the shock . when dsa is efficient , the shock is modified by the back pressure of accelerated particles and the flow speed , @xmath59 , becomes a `` smooth '' function of @xmath14 , i.e. , an upstream precursor with @xmath60 forms .",
    "in addition to shock smoothing , the overall compression ratio of the shock , @xmath61 , will increase when the acceleration is efficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath61 is obtained by iteration as well .",
    "below , we show how our code has been generalized to include the modification of the diffusion coefficient by the buildup of magnetic turbulence .      to calculate the effect of the pressure gradient of particles on magnetic field fluctuations , we start with an equation similar to equation  ( b.8 ) in @xcite : @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the energy density of the waves ( assuming that the kinetic energy density of shear wave motion equals the magnetic energy density ) , @xmath64 is the wave energy flux ( the @xmath65 represents the sum of the poynting flux and the flux associated with the transverse motion of plasma in alfvn  waves ) , @xmath66 is the magnetic pressure of waves acting on the plasma flow , and @xmath67 represents wave energy losses ( or gains ) due to processes other than compression and amplification by the considered instability , and @xmath68 is the pressure gradient of cosmic rays exciting the alfvn  waves .",
    "this equation describes the growth of the energy in alfvn  waves through their instability in the presence of cr streaming , and it assumes that all the waves are moving upstream with respect to the plasma at speed @xmath69 , so @xmath70 .",
    "now , following @xcite , we separate the turbulence into downstream- and upstream - moving structures , and define the energy density of these structures per wavenumber interval as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , so that the total energy density of turbulence is @xmath73dk \\ .\\ ] ] we also define the partial pressure of particles with momentum @xmath26 per unit momentum interval as @xmath74 so that the total pressure in particles , including thermal ones , is @xmath75    to derive equations for @xmath76 , we apply a steady - state version of ( [ mckveqn ] ) to waves with wavenumber @xmath29 in the interval @xmath77 . for the energy density of these waves in the first order of @xmath77 we substitute @xmath78 \\delta k \\ .\\ ] ] for the energy flux ,",
    "we write @xmath79 \\delta k \\ , \\ ] ] and for the pressure of particles interacting with these waves , @xmath80 substituting these expressions into ( [ mckveqn ] ) , ignoring the energy loss ( gain ) term @xmath67 , then dividing both sides by @xmath81 and taking the limit @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 =   \\qquad",
    "\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad\\ ] ] @xmath84",
    "where we have replaced @xmath85 with a weighted wave speed @xmath86 in the driving term . using @xmath87 is a logical extension of the definition of an `` average '' wave speed by @xcite applied to a narrow wavenumber range @xmath81 .",
    "this , again , is justified as long as @xmath17 , but becomes less clear for strong turbulence . in these equations , @xmath30 is defined as in equation  ( [ vg ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath88 that the driving term has acquired is necessary to relate the interval of wavenumbers @xmath81 of amplified waves to the interval of momenta of particles interacting with these waves @xmath89 .",
    "as mentioned above , the relationship between @xmath26 and @xmath29 ( i.e. , the resonant condition ) is assumed to be @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , and @xmath1 is the far upstream magnetic field .",
    "one may argue that the field that the particles ` feel ' as uniform in the non - linear regime @xmath92 is the field carried by all long - wavelength ( relative to the particle gyroradius ) harmonics , rather than @xmath1 . while this may be true in general , our present model is insensitive to the choice of the resonance condition due to the simplified `` bohm '' form of the particle mean free path we assume .    equation ( [ amplinnew ] ) expresses energy conservation and accounts for the amplification of turbulence by the streaming instability with the growth rate determined from kinetic theory .",
    "furthermore , we assume , as did @xcite , that interactions between the forward and backward moving waves drive them to isotropy on a time scale @xmath93 . in order to account for this interaction ,",
    "we write equation  ( [ amplinnew ] ) as the sum of the following two equations for @xmath76 : @xmath94\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}u_- + u_-\\frac{d}{dx } \\left ( \\frac32 u(x ) -",

    "we note that equations  ( [ uminuskp ] ) and ( [ upluskp ] ) are consistent with equation  ( [ amplinnew ] ) with or without the relaxation terms on the right - hand sides of both equations , but these terms may become important in cases with small shock velocities .    equations ( [ uminuskp ] ) and ( [ upluskp ] ) are generalizations of those introduced by @xcite .",
    "the generalization has two essential improvements .",
    "first , it accounts for the spatial dependence of flow speed @xmath59 due to nonlinear  effects of efficient dsa and , consequently , treats ` compression ' of the amplified field adequately . to illustrate this effect ,",
    "consider ( [ uminuskp ] ) and ( [ upluskp ] ) , neglecting the cosmic - ray pressure gradient term and @xmath69 , i.e. , taking @xmath98 .",
    "adding the two equations then results in @xmath99+\\frac32 [ u_-+u_+ ]   \\frac{d}{dx}u(x)=0 \\ , \\ ] ] which can be easily integrated to give @xmath100 \\propto u^{-3/2}$ ] , or @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , in a shock with a total compression ratio @xmath102 , for example , the stochastic magnetic field gets a boost in amplification by a factor of about @xmath103 solely through the compression of the plasma .",
    "this compressional effect is especially important at the subshock and the change in magnetic turbulence energy density across the subshock will influence the subshock compression ratio @xmath104 .",
    "this in turn will have a strong effect on the injection efficiency in the monte carlo model .",
    "second , we generalized the equations to describe the whole spectrum of turbulence @xmath76 rather than a single waveband with @xmath105 .",
    "we solve this system with a finite - difference method , integrating from far upstream ( @xmath106 ) to @xmath14 .",
    "the quantities @xmath59 and @xmath74 are obtained from the monte carlo  simulation , as described in section [ mcsection ] . for simplicity in this initial presentation of our model , and because the shocks we are mainly concerned with have high alfvn  mach numbers ( @xmath107 ) , we have neglected @xmath30 compared to @xmath10 in the first and second terms in equations  ( [ uminuskp ] ) and ( [ upluskp ] ) in the numerical results we present here . in the shock precursor and @xmath108 in the post - shock region .",
    "] we do , however , account for the wave or scattering center speed relative to the bulk flow speed in determining the energy change a particle receives as it scatters in the converging flow . in each interaction , we replace @xmath109 , and since @xmath87 is generally negative in the upstream region ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) , a finite @xmath87 dampens particle acceleration .",

    "is contained in high - momentum particles .",
    "these particles have long mean free paths and will resonantly produce turbulence where long - wavelength harmonics contain most of the wave energy .",
    "consequently , to low - momentum particles , the strong long - wavelength turbulence appears approximately as a uniform field and equation  ( [ mfp ] ) is justified . for the highest energy particles , however",

    ", the situation with @xmath7 is reversed with the @xmath198@xmath4 g  shock obtaining the highest @xmath7 .",

    "the top panels show that increasing the growth rate ( increasing @xmath204 and therefore @xmath30 ) produces a large change in the shock structure and causes the overall shock compression ratio , @xmath61 , to decrease .",
    "the decrease in @xmath61 signifies a decrease in the acceleration efficiency and a decrease in the fraction of energy that escapes at the feb , and the subshock compression adjusts to ensure conservation of momentum and energy .",

    "in contrast to the strong modification of @xmath59 , there is little difference in @xmath212 ( bottom panels of figure  [ amp_grid ] ) and little change in @xmath7 ( figure  [ amp_fp ] ) , between these examples .",
    "the fact that increasing the wave growth rate decreases the acceleration efficiency shows the nonlinear  nature of the wave generation process and comes about for two reasons .",
    "the most important is that the magnetic pressure term in equation  ( [ pflux ] ) , @xmath159 , becomes significant compared to @xmath217 when @xmath218 .",
    "the wave pressure causes the shock to be less compressive overall and forces @xmath61 down .",
    "any change in @xmath61 changes the acceleration efficiency and therefore changes @xmath219 , the wave growth , and the shock structure .",
    "the second reason is that as the turbulence grows , @xmath87 grows and the effective scattering center speed @xmath220 drops , causing the acceleration efficiency to drop .",
    "for the examples shown in figure  [ amp_grid ] , the change produced by @xmath87 is modest compared to the effect from @xmath159 . taken together , at least for the parameters used here ,",
    "the increase in @xmath159 and @xmath87 outweigh any increase in efficiency the amplified field produces .    in figure  [ amp_fp ]",
    "we show the distribution functions for the four examples of figure  [ amp_grid ] and note that the low momentum peaks shift upward significantly with increasing @xmath204 .",
    "the approximate momenta , measured in the downstream plasma frame , where the distributions peak , @xmath207 , are listed in table  1 . as we have emphasized , the injection efficiency , i.e. , the fraction of particles that enter the fermi process , must adjust to conserve momentum and energy and the low momentum peaks shift as a result of this .",
    "the solid dots in figure  [ amp_fp ] roughly indicate the injection point separating `` thermal '' and superthermal particles for the two extreme cases of @xmath221 and 1 .",
    "the first thing to note is that this injection point is not well defined , a consequence of the fact that the mc model does nt distinguish between `` thermal '' and `` nonthermal '' particles .",
    "once the shock has become smooth , the injection process is smooth and the superthermal population smoothly emerges from the quasi - thermal population .",
    "nevertheless , the approximate momentum where the superthermal population develops , @xmath222 , can be estimated and we mark this position with solid dots for @xmath46 and @xmath223 .",
    "what is illustrated by this is that the injection point shifts , _ relative to the post - shock distribution _ , when @xmath204 is varied .",
    "this implies that , if injection is parameterized , the parameterization must somehow be connected to modifications in the shock structure .",
    "we have generalized a steady - state monte carlo  model of efficient diffusive shock acceleration to include magnetic wave growth , allowing the wave amplitude to become large compared to the ambient field , i.e. , @xmath224 .",
    "the model uses a phenomenological treatment of wave generation by applying the linear growth rate formalism in the non - linear regime , but couples the nonlinear  shock structure , the injection rate of thermal particles , the magnetic field amplification , and the determination of the maximum momentum particles obtain from a physical constraint , i.e. , the size of the shock system , in an internally self - consistent  manner .",
    "important limitations of our model are the simplified treatment of wave growth and the neglect of wave damping .",
    "we also assume a bohm - like expression for the scattering mean free path [ i.e. , @xmath225 $ ] rather than calculating @xmath175 from more fundamental relations which account for particle motions in strongly anisotropic turbulence .",
    "more physically realistic models for turbulence generation and damping and particle scattering are certainly necessary and may well modify the results we present here .",
    "however , it is not straightforward to include these processes in nonlinear  models and , to our knowledge , none have yet been presented with as extensive nonlinear  coupling as we calculate .",
    "we believe the approximations we make are an important intermediate step and that the results we present are indicative of what more complete models will show .",
    "the fact that the mc technique can handle anisotropic particle distributions will be essential for including more precise plasma physics in future generalizations .",
    "the difference between our monte carlo  simulation and a particle - in - cell ( pic ) plasma simulation is that the pitch - angle diffusion is treated phenomenologically in the mc with an assumed scattering mean free path , rather than calculating particle trajectories in the self - generated magnetic field obtained directly from maxwell s equations .",
    "this approximation is essential in order to make the mc technique fast enough to model acceleration over a wide dynamic range .",
    "we emphasize that while pic simulations , in principle , can solve the shock acceleration problem completely , their computational requirements are extreme and they are not yet capable of modeling acceleration over a dynamic range large enough to model cosmic sources such as snrs .",
    "the most important constraint on pic simulations is that they must be done fully in three dimensions . as shown by @xcite and @xcite , pic simulations with",
    "one or more ignorable dimensions artificially confine particles to field lines and eliminate cross - field diffusion , an essential ingredient in diffusive shock acceleration , particularly in oblique shocks .",
    "the 3-d requirement means that all three box dimensions must be increased to accommodate high - energy particles with long diffusion length scales so that computing requirements become insurmountable for a large enough dynamic range . to model snr shocks",
    ", they must be able to accelerate particles from thermal to highly relativistic  energies and , if electrons are to be modeled , they must simultaneously include electron and proton scales .- ray - bursts may actually be less stringent than those for the non - relativistic  shocks in snrs . in shocks with large lorentz factors ,",
    "particles start off relativistic  ( in the shock frame ) and can gain a great deal of energy in just a few shock interactions .",
    "it is also possible that electron ",
    "positron plasmas dominate the @xmath226-ray - burst fireball so that important results can be obtained without simultaneously covering electron ",
    "proton scales . in the non - relativistic  shocks present in snrs ,",
    "however , both electrons and protons must be accelerated over a wide dynamic range from ev to tev energies by crossing the shock many times . ]",
    "while pic simulations will be able to investigate important problems , particularly those concerning injection , they will not be able to model the shock acceleration of electrons and protons to the energies necessary to produce broad - band radiation with parameters similar to those of snrs in the foreseeable future . until then",
    ", progress can be made with approximate methods .",
    "besides the limited results from pic simulations , the only models of magnetic field generation with @xmath92 in nonlinear  dsa that we are aware of are the semi - analytic  results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned , our work uses the same basic wave generation formalism as @xcite , with an extensive generalization to include injection , nonlinear  shock structure and particle distributions , and @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , @xcite has attempted to improve the plasma physics by calculating amplified fields from a so - called `` directly driven '' mode of wave instability .-",
    "fields can be amplified by orders of magnitude but they were limited in dynamic range and did not self - consistently  model the particle acceleration process . ] in this scheme , upstream energetic particles standing in the shock frame produce a macroscopic current , and magnetic field , in the upstream plasma frame .",
    "this extended the @xcite analysis to wave modes other than resonant alfvnic ones and emphasized that turbulence is likely the result of strongly driven , non - resonant modes at shorter wavelengths rather than alfvn  waves .",
    "a recent application of this idea to relativistic  shocks expected in grbs is given @xcite . while this is a promising idea for a non - resonant mechanism for wave amplification in strong shocks , careful consideration of the plasma return current",
    "must be made ( e.g. , f.c .",
    "jones , private communication ) .",
    "another non - resonant mechanism for long - wavelength magnetic field fluctuation amplification in the vicinity of shock waves was studied by @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that a small fraction of neutral atoms can reduce the plasma transverse conductivity and result in a cosmic - ray current instability .",
    "this instability was shown to produce long - wavelength magnetic fluctuations .",
    "an important attempt at describing turbulence with @xmath227 was made by @xcite .",
    "these authors assumed a kolmogorov - type nonlinear  cascade and damping of self - generated turbulence by ion - neutral collisions .",
    "most importantly , they obtained estimates for @xmath7 in a time - dependent analytic calculation .",
    "nonlinear particle acceleration was assumed , but the analytic method required a number of approximations including the spatial distribution of energetic particles in the shock precursor and the spectral form of the energetic particles .",
    "nevertheless , this work showed that nonlinear  particle acceleration , combined with @xmath2-field amplification , may strongly influence @xmath7 , one of the most important parameters in diffusive shock acceleration .    in our estimation , the most highly developed model of nonlinear  dsa with magnetic field amplification",
    "is that of @xcite ; work based on a series of papers by blasi and co - workers ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we now give a detailed comparison between that model and ours .",

    "particles gain energy when they diffuse in the converging flow and neither model includes second - order fermi acceleration .",
    "both models are also for plane - parallel , steady - state shocks .",
    "the most important difference revolves around the method of solution .",

    "solve a transport or diffusion - convection equation .",
    "in the blasi et al .",
    "work , macroscopic quantities ( pressure , energy flux , etc . ) are derived as moments of the particle distribution function @xmath176 , which is assumed to be isotropic in the shock reference frame .",
    "in contrast , the monte carlo  simulation traces the stochastic motion of individual particles as they pitch - angle scatter off the background turbulence and calculates @xmath176 and its moments directly from the particle trajectories without making any assumptions about the isotropy of @xmath176 . in effect",
    ", the mc simulation solves the more fundamental boltzmann equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "of course , the semi - analytic technique is much faster computationally than the monte carlo  technique and this will be important for building models in many applications .",
    "injection can be treated self - consistently  in the mc simulation because , once the pitch - angle scattering assumptions are made , they are applied equally to all particles and the number and energy of injected particles is fully determined .",
    "no distinction is made between thermal and superthermal particles and the viscous subshock is assumed to be transparent so there is a nonzero probability for any downstream particle with @xmath228 to be injected .",
    "the diffusion approximation , on the other hand , with its assumption of isotropy forces additional assumptions if injection is to be modeled .",
    "blasi et al .",
    "treat the subshock as having a finite thickness comparable to a thermal particle s gyroradius and the injection rate is parameterized such that only those particles get injected , which have a gyroradius large enough to span the subshock .",
    "while this adds an additional parameter independent of the diffusion properties , it has been shown that parameters can easily be determined so that the monte carlo  and semi - analytic models give similar results ( see * ? ? ?",
    "another important difference is that @xcite have included a phenomenological description of turbulent @xmath2-field heating , similar in implementation to that used in @xcite , in addition to adiabatic heating .",
    "we only include adiabatic heating .",
    "the amplified turbulence may be dissipated through collisional and/or collisionless mechanisms and these include : = 0by 1  linear and nonlinear  landau damping ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , by 1  particle trapping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by 1  ion - neutral wave damping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it s important to note that even though the damping rates tend to be smaller than the wave growth rates for long - wavelength fluctuations in turbulent plasmas with a substantial nonthermal component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the generation of magnetic energy density can be approximately balanced by the convection of that turbulence through the shock ( as was assumed here ) and mhd cascade processes .",

    "* ) and this in turn modifies injection . the overall acceleration efficiency and , of particular importance for x - ray observations , the temperature of the shocked plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will depend on wave dissipation .",
    "we plan to include physically realistic models of wave damping in the mc simulation in future work .",
    "the two most important elements in these nonlinear  models is the turbulence generation and the diffusion coefficient that is derived from it .",
    "the assumptions for wave generation by the streaming instability are essentially identical in the blasi et al .",
    "model and ours .",
    "the most important difference in the models lies in the calculation of the mean free path and diffusion coefficient . here",

    "both of these assumptions are approximations .",
    "our bohm - like expression is just a phenomenological recipe for particle diffusion in strong turbulence , while @xmath41 is only formally valid for weak turbulence but is applied to diffusion in strong , anisotropic turbulence .",
    "an important step in advancing the state - of - the - art of nonlinear  shock acceleration must center on improving the connection from wave generation to diffusion .    that important aspects of dsa are sensitive to the assumptions made for diffusion can be seen by comparing the self - generated @xmath32 from these two models .",
    "our use of equation  ( [ mfp ] ) forces bohm  like diffusion with @xmath231 and we show this dependence in figure  [ u_d_fp ] .",
    "nevertheless , we have argued in section  [ sect_scat ] that equation  ( [ mfp ] ) overestimates the scattering strength for the highest momentum particles because most of the harmonics appear as short - scale fluctuations to these particles .",
    "this would suggest that the actual @xmath26 dependence of @xmath32 increases with @xmath26 , likely as @xmath232 at the highest energies . in @xcite , on the other hand , the momentum dependence of @xmath32 is shown to weaken at high @xmath26 to the point where the scattering becomes strong enough that @xmath32 becomes independent of @xmath26 in high sonic mach number shocks .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xcite result is indicating that the magnetic turbulence spectrum has a slope approaching @xmath233 .",
    "for this turbulence spectral slope , the _ quasi - linear model _ predicts energy independent diffusion ( in the weak fluctuation limit of course ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the magnetic fluctuation spectrum we obtain with bohm diffusion has , over a wide wavenumber range , a spectral slope roughly corresponding to @xmath234 ( see figure  [ u_d_fp ] ) .",
    "so , if one formally calculated the _ quasi - linear _ diffusion from equation  ( [ mfp_ab06 ] ) with our fluctuation spectrum , the resulting diffusion coefficient would have only a weak energy dependence .",
    "this could mean that the magnetic fluctuation spectral shape is not very sensitive to the choice of diffusion model in the nonlinear calculations . nevertheless , in this preliminary work",
    ", we prefer to use the bohm diffusion model in the strong fluctuation limit .",
    "since the behavior of @xmath32 at high @xmath26 determines @xmath7 , as well as influencing all other aspects of the shock acceleration process , it s clear that much work remains to be done on this difficult problem .",

    "they used a time - dependent solution of the cosmic - ray transport equation coupled to the gas dynamic equations in spherical symmetry and calculated the superthermal proton distribution , from the forward shock , at all positions in the remnant . from this",
    "they can determine the overall contribution a single snr makes to the galactic cosmic - ray  proton flux .",
    "furthermore , since they included the acceleration of superthermal electrons , they calculated the photon emission from synchrotron  and ic processes , as well as from proton - proton interactions and pion - decay .",
    "this allowed them to fit the broad - band photon observations and constrain the model parameters .",

    "first , our calculations find that efficient shock acceleration can amplify ambient magnetic fields by large factors and are generally consistent with the large fields believed to exist at blast waves in young snrs , although we have not attempted a detailed fit to snr observations in this paper . while the numerical values we obtain depend on the particular parameters for our examples , and we will investigate in detail how the amplification depends on sonic mach number , age , and size of the shock system , etc .",
    ", in future work , amplification factors of several 100 are clearly possible .    more specifically , we find that the amplification , in terms of the downstream to far upstream field ratio @xmath11 is a strong function of alfvn  mach number , with weak ambient fields being amplified more than strong ones .",
    "for the range of examples shown in figure  [ vary_bz ] , @xmath237 for @xmath238 and @xmath239 for @xmath240 .",
    "qualitatively , a strong correlation between amplification and @xmath196 should not depend strongly on our approximations and may have important consequences . in young snrs , the expansion of the ejecta material will drastically reduce any original , pre - sn circumstellar magnetic field .",
    "in fact , for any conceivable progenitor , the magnetic field inside of the reverse shock will drop to values too low to support the acceleration of electrons to radio emitting energies only a few years after the explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "evidence for radio emission at reverse shocks in snrs has been reported ( see , * ? ? ? * for example ) and the strong amplification of low fields we see here , may make it possible for reverse shocks in young snrs to accelerate electrons to relativistic  energies and produce radio synchrotron  emission . if similar effects occur in relativistic  shocks , these large amplification factors will be critical for the internal shocks presumed to exist in @xmath226-ray  bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "even if large @xmath2-field amplification  is confined to non - relativisticshocks , which tend to be more efficient accelerators than relativistic  ones , amplification will be important for understanding grb afterglows since the expanding fireball will slow as it moves through the interstellar medium and will always go through trans - relativistic  and non - relativistic  phases .",
    "as expected , amplifying the magnetic field leads to a greater maximum particle momentum , @xmath7 , a given shock can produce .",
    "quantifying @xmath7 is one of the outstanding problems in shock physics because of the difficulty in obtaining parameters for typical snrs that allow the production of cosmic rays to energies at and above the cr knee near @xmath241ev . assuming that acceleration is truncated by the size of the shock system , we determine @xmath7 from a physical constraint : the relevant parameter is the distance to the free escape boundary in diffusion lengths .",
    "this means that the limit on acceleration feeds back on the shock structure and also mimics , in terms of the spectral shape , what happens in actual shocks where @xmath176 must turn over smoothly at the highest energies ( as in figure  [ vary_bz_fp ] ) .",
    "the spectral shape will be particularly important if the model is applied to the knee of the cosmic - ray spectrum or to nonthermal x - ray emission in snrs .",
    "our results show that @xmath7 does increase when field amplification is included , but the increase is considerably less than the amplification factor at the shock @xmath11 ( compare the heavy dotted and heavy solid curves in figure  [ bl_nobl_fp ] ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that high momentum particles have long diffusion lengths and the precursor magnetic field well upstream from the subshock strongly influences @xmath7 .",
    "we calculate the spatial structure of the amplified magnetic field ( figs .  [ bl_nobl ] and [ vary_bz ] ) and , as expected , field amplification is greatest near the subshock and @xmath21 merges into the ambient field far upstream .",
    "the diffusion length that determines @xmath7 ( i.e. , @xmath242_\\mathrm{ave}$ ] ) is some weighted average over the varying @xmath59 and @xmath145 and is considerably greater than that estimated from @xmath8 alone .",
    "if the shock size , in our case @xmath169 , limits acceleration , @xmath7 will be considerably less than crude estimates using a spatially independent @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , particles spend a large fraction of their time downstream from the shock where the field is high and collision times are short .",
    "if shock age limits acceleration rather than size , we expect the increase in @xmath7 from the amplified field to be closer to the amplification factor , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the spatial structure of the precursor field and @xmath59 , in addition to the overall amplification of @xmath2 , will determine the relative time spent upstream versus downstream and will determine @xmath7 for a given shock system .",
    "this will be even more critical for electrons than for ions since electrons experience synchrotron  and inverse - compton  losses which will mainly occur downstream .",
    "again , the qualitative nature of the above conclusions should not depend on the particular parameters and approximations we make here .",
    "we leave more detailed quantitative work for future study .",
    "finally , it is well known that dsa is inherently efficient .",
    "field amplification reduces the fraction of shock ram kinetic energy that is placed in relativistic  particles but , at least for the limited examples we show here , the overall acceleration process remains extremely efficient .",
    "even with large increases in @xmath145 , well over 50% of the shock energy can go into relativistic  particles ( figure  [ inj_eff ] ) .",
    "as in all self - consistent  calculations , the injection efficiency must adjust to conserve momentum and energy . in comparing shocks with and without field amplification ,",
    "we find that field amplification lowers @xmath61 and , therefore , individual energetic particles are , on average , accelerated less efficiently . in order to conserve momentum and energy",
    ", this means that more thermal particles must be injected when amplification occurs .",
    "the shock accomplishes this by establishing a strong subshock which not only injects a larger fraction of particles , but also more strongly heats the downstream plasma .",
    "this establishes a nonlinear  connection between the field amplification , the production of cosmic rays , and the x - ray emission from the shocked heated plasma .",
