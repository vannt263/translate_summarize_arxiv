    "high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) were discovered by muller , oort , & raimond ( 1963 ) in the 21-cm line emission of neutral atomic hydrogen ( hi ) .",
    "hvcs are gas clouds which are characterized by high radial velocities incompatible with a participation in galactic rotation .",
    "braun & burton ( 1999 ) introduced a subclass of isolated hvcs with small angular sizes of less than @xmath0 fwhm .",
    "they compiled a catalog of 66 of these so - called compact high - velocity clouds ( chvcs ) from the leiden / dwingeloo survey of galactic neutral hydrogen ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) and proposed that their statistical properties were consistent with a distribution throughout the entire local group with distances of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "the typical sizes of chvcs would then be of the order of @xmath2 with typical hi masses of a few times @xmath3 .",
    "we mapped 11 chvcs from the braun & burton ( 1999 ) and de heij , braun , & burton ( 2002 ) catalogs in 21-cm line emission with the 100-m telescope in effelsberg to validate the results of braun & burton ( 1999 ) .",
    "the high angular resolution of @xmath4 hpbw allows us to extract the hi structure of these 11 chvcs in much more detail than the previous leiden / dwingeloo survey data . in section  2",
    "we describe the sample selection and data acquisition , section  3 outlines our major results , and section  4 includes the summary and conclusions .",
    "the 11 studied chvcs were selected on the basis of earlier , less sensitive effelsberg observations by two criteria .",
    "they still had to be classified as chvcs in the improved catalog by de heij et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and the hi peak column density ratio between the effelsberg data and the leiden / dwingeloo survey had to be @xmath5 so that only the most compact chvcs were selected for reinvestigation .    in general , each object was mapped with @xmath6 spectra on a @xmath4 grid ( beam - by - beam sampling ) .",
    "we reach a sensitivity of @xmath7 at @xmath8 velocity resolution .",
    "these maps allow us to investigate the morphology of our 11 chvcs and the overall distribution of radial velocities and linewidths of the hi gas .",
    "in addition , we observed spectra along an appropriate axis of each chvc with a longer integration time and a smaller separation of @xmath9 or @xmath10 between the spectra .",
    "along these deep profiles we reach a sensitivity of @xmath11 , allowing us to obtain the column density profile in more detail .",
    "table [ chvc_table ] summarizes the extracted physical parameters of the observed chvcs , derived by fitting a gaussian to the spectral lines .",
    "radial velocities are mainly negative which is simply a selection effect .",
    "the mean linewidth of our 11 chvcs is @xmath12 , the mean peak brightness temperature is @xmath13 , and the average peak column density is @xmath14 . in some cases",
    ", we find evidence for two distinct gas phases in the spectral lines , indicating the existence of a core of cold neutral gas embedded in a diffuse envelope of warm neutral gas .    among the 11 investigated objects , only chvc 148@xmath1582 appears to be spherically - symmetric ( fig .",
    "[ fig_overview ] ( a ) ) .",
    "all other clouds have a more or less complex morphology .",
    "4 chvcs reveal a head - tail structure which indicates that their envelopes of diffuse , warm gas are stripped off by ram - pressure interaction with an ambient medium .",
    "the conception of an interaction process is also supported by the distribution of radial velocities and linewidths across all 4 clouds .",
    "[ fig_overview ] ( b ) shows chvc 040@xmath1601 as an example for a pronounced head - tail structure .",
    "another example for a head - tail chvc is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_chvc01 ] ( a ) .",
    "chvc 017@xmath1525 is a relatively compact object , and its slightly asymmetric shape already indicates that gas might have been stripped off the cloud , creating a diffuse , faint tail in north - western direction .",
    "furthermore , chvc 017@xmath1525 shows a clear two - component structure in the hi line profiles .",
    "spectral lines seem to disclose a superposition of a narrow gaussian component of cold gas and a broad component of warm gas .",
    "the cold component shows line widths of about @xmath17 fwhm , resulting in an upper limit for the gas temperature of roughly @xmath18 .",
    "the warm component discloses much larger line widths around @xmath19 fwhm , indicating an upper limit for the gas temperature of about @xmath20 .",
    "both gas components can be investigated separately by a gaussian decomposition of the spectral lines .",
    "[ fig_chvc01 ] ( b ) shows the distribution of hi column densities of the cold ( open circles ) and warm ( filled circles ) gas along the profile indicated by the dashed arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig_chvc01 ] ( a ) .",
    "one can clearly distinguish a compact cold core surrounded by an extended , diffuse envelope of warm gas .",
    "furthermore , the cold core and the warm envelope are spatially separated from each other . at the south - eastern edge of the cloud , only the cold gas can be traced while the warm gas forms an extended , faint tail in north - western direction .",
    "these results suggest that the diffuse envelope of warm gas is currently being stripped off the compact cold core of chvc 017@xmath1525 by ram - pressure interaction with an ambient medium .",
    "two chvcs from our sample show up with a bow - shock shaped structure which again indicates the existence of an ambient medium .",
    "[ fig_overview ] ( c ) shows chvc 172@xmath1560 as an example for a bow - shock shaped object . in both chvcs ,",
    "radial velocities indicate that the gas is decelerated at the presumable front of the cloud . at the same time ,",
    "linewidths increase , indicating higher turbulence or heating of the gas .",
    "again , these observations can best be explained by ram - pressure interaction with a medium surrounding the chvcs .    the remaining 4 chvcs from our sample reveal an irregular shape .",
    "some of these irregular clouds have large radial velocity gradients , suggesting a rotation . in all cases",
    ", the irregular morphology again indicates a disturbance of the objects .",
