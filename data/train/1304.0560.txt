    "the model of universe which currently gives the best fit of the available astrophysical observations is the @xmath0 cold dark matter model ( @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "the model is based on a exact solution of equation of general relativity which assumes homogeneity and isotropy with a f - l metric . quite soon , however , observational evidences required the addition of two main artefacts to the theory : the dark matter and the dark energy .",
    "rotation curve of spiral galaxies , velocity dispersion of galaxies in galaxy clusters , cluster mass estimate from hot intra - cluster gas emission , gravitational lensing from galaxy cluster , large scale structure formation from cmb tiny fluctuations required an addition of dark matter .",
    "the observation of an accelerated expansion of the universe required the addition of the dark energy . according to the best fit model ,",
    "dark matter should account for @xmath5 of the total energy density , while the dark energy for @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "notwithstanding , the nature of both remains unknown and is amongst the deepest problems of modern physics .",
    "for these reason in the past decade , several authors @xcite-@xcite have explored alternatives to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "+ the discovery of a lumpier universe than expected offered a possibility in this respect .",
    "the universe appears indeed organized as a cosmic web , which can be described as an interconnected network : spherical clusters form the nodes and are joined by elongated filaments defining 2d sheets .",
    "recent analysis have shown that voids in the network could fill between @xmath7 of the space ( accordingly to definition and measure of the voids ) and have a continuous distribution of sizes depending on the galaxy sample selected @xcite .",
    "such observed inhomogeneities are usually described as a first order perturbation with respect to the homogeneous and isotropic exact solution .",
    "this formulation has a limited application , since it is valid for small perturbation @xmath8 and can not describe the lumpy universe at low redshift . nevertheless , it was soon clear , mainly through the formulation of the buchert formalism , that such an inhomogeneous matter distribution could indeed mimic the presence of dark energy @xcite .",
    "since then , some authors explored this possibility to the extreme consequence to explain the whole amount of dark energy on the basis of inhomogeneous distribution .",
    "our personal opinion is that the requested existence of gpc scale voids makes these models questionable . from the other side ,",
    "the standard perturbative approach of @xmath0cdm can not answer to the question of the effect of small scale strong fluctuations on larger scale . in this context",
    ", an interesting line appears the exploration of cosmological models including the largely accepted cosmological constant paradigm and at the same time a non perturbative approach to the observed inhomogeneities .",
    "this issue is a very recent one ( see @xcite ) and so far limited to the not so realistic ( even useful ) case of spherical simmetry . going beyond such studies and toward a more realistic model of matter distribution in the universe is the target of the present paper .",
    "the elaboration of a similar model will allow , for example , to study in a non perturbative way the percentage of dark energy that can be explained in terms of the observed inhomogeneities or the role of voids in the process of structure formation ( see for example @xcite ) in a more complete way for the presence both of dark energy and voids in the model .",
    "more in general , it would be possible to explore the effect of the observed inomogeneities onto cosmic scale data , as barionic acoustic oscillations and cosmic radiation .",
    "our baseline is the so - called fractal bubble fb or timescape cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is based on the buchert average scheme @xcite and introduces a non - uniform time flow with two scales corresponding to the voids and walls of a schematic lattice cosmic structure . in the fb model the apparent acceleration is explained in terms of different rate of clocks located in walls ( our point of observation ) as compared to the clocks of voids .",
    "the viability of the fb or timescape model as an alternative to the @xmath0cdm model is still matter of debat @xcite . in any case",
    ", the fb model is the first one which describes a schematic cosmic web in a non perturbative way and without invoking particular symmetries .",
    "this interesting feature has prompted one of us to propose an inhomogeneous model based on the same partitioning within the buchert average scheme , but including a @xmath9 and an uniform time flow @xcite .",
    "this model , hereafter @xmath0fb model , allows to investigate , in a non perturbative way , the effects of large scale spatial inhomogeneities and non - vanishing curvature on the cosmological parameters .",
    "the present preliminary study is devoted to such aim .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following : in section 2 we write the relevant equations of the model .",
    "we obtain a new interesting equation involving all the parameters of the model evaluated at the present epoch , which is analysed in sections 3 and 4 . in section 5",
    "we dress the cosmological parameters and finally , we report our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the @xmath0fb model @xcite incorporates the observed present inhomogeneities within the cosmological constant paradigm .",
    "the starting point is the fb model introduced by wiltshire @xcite .",
    "this model considers a matter distribution in the universe as a regular network formed by walls and voids .",
    "the @xmath0fb model assumes the same partitioning of the two scale fb model @xcite : regions called finite infinity ( @xmath10 ) which are the set of timelike boundaries of compact * disjoint * domains @xmath11 , with a zero average expansion and a positive one outside , i.e. @xmath12 . the @xmath10 regions are within wall regions whose metric is , on average : @xmath13 .",
    "\\label{1}\\ ] ] our position is in @xmath10 .",
    "the regions complementary to the walls with respect to the particle horizon are called voids and are expanding with an average hyperbolic metric given by : @xmath14 .",
    "\\label{2}\\ ] ] note that , contrary to the fb model , in our model the time flow is isotropic .",
    "this is due to the presence of a non vanishing cosmological constant , which is absent in the fb model since it intends to explain it as an effect of inhomogeneity .",
    "the isotropic flow has the useful feature to avoid the shortcomings related to the junction conditions of the original fb model ( see @xcite ) . in any case ,",
    "a nontrivial phenomenological lapse function involves new physics relating to gravitational energy which is not yet widely accepted , and we will therefore consider the commonly accepted alternative that time flows uniformly .",
    "+ the hubble parameters in walls and voids are respectively @xmath15 .",
    "an important assumption of the @xmath0fb model ( and fb one ) is the existence of a scale of homogeneity with the scale factor @xmath16 .",
    "the average on the whole volume of the particle horizon @xmath17 is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the fractions of walls and voids at the time @xmath21 .",
    "we choose the time @xmath22 ( the initial time ) as the recombination time in order to compare the model with available observational data .",
    "in general the following relations are valid for any time : @xmath23 the hubble rate @xmath24 at the scale of homogeneity is : @xmath25 and the density parameters are : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the kinematic backreaction and @xmath28 is the spatial curvature .",
    "the buchert equations are : @xmath29=0 .",

    "a first integral of eqs ( [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] ) is : @xmath32 from equation ( [ 8 ] ) ( see @xcite ) we can solve for @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 we are now able to derive an useful and interesting formula . by combining equations ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) and evaluating them at the present epoch @xmath36 we obtain : @xmath37 the equation ( [ 12 ] ) constraints the density parameters and the fraction of voids at the present time @xmath36 .",
    "the equation was already present in @xcite .",
    "now we intend to go a step beyond , expressing the constant @xmath38 in terms of density parameters . integrating equation ( [ 8 ] )",
    "we get : @xmath39 it is should be noticed that in the equation ( [ 13 ] ) , according to @xcite and without loss of generality , we have set to zero the integration constant . in such a way , the study of the cosmological constant is simpler .",
    "this choice constraints the integration constant in the integration of the equation ( [ 9 ] ) ( see @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , it gives a compatibility equation for cosmological parameters that are averaged quantities in principle measurable .",
    "it should be noted that this equation is not perturbative .",
    "it allows to study the effects of the inhomogeneities without ruling out the dark energy and avoiding the shortcomings of the perturbation theory when applied to large inhomogeneities .",
    "+ the cosmological parameters present in ( [ 15 ] ) are different from those of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the concordance model is based on an exact solution of einstein s equations and the corresponding cosmological parameters are local quantities .",
    "the homogeneity and isotropy of the solution implies that the cosmological parameters are the same in any spatial point for any fixed comoving time @xmath44 .",
    "as the timescape model , also the @xmath0fb one is obtained within the buchert formalism , where the cosmological parameters are averaged non local quantities . in this formalism for a given scalar @xmath45 at a fixed cosmological time @xmath44 , the average on the whole particle horizon is : @xmath46 where the subscrits @xmath47 and @xmath48 refer obviously to the values of @xmath45 in voids and walls .",
    "astrophysical data refer to the local value of @xmath45 that can be generally different from its averaged one @xmath49 .",
    "if we consider the universe as a cosmic web , these averaged parameters are physical quantities obtained from an average procedure over a given astrophysical sample containing voids and walls .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are mean values calculated separately in walls and voids . + in any case",
    ", the model has a scale of statistical homogeneity , beyond which it has a friedmann metric evolving with @xmath16 given by eq.([3 ] ) . by consequence ,",
    "the cosmological parameters obtained as averaged quantities at the scale of homogeneity can be straightforward compared with the corresponding values of the standard concordance model .",
    "for this reason , we expect that the numerical values for the cosmological parameters of the @xmath52fb model are similar to those of the standard cosmological model .",
    "+ as a further consideration on the @xmath0fb model , note that the formalism introduced allows easily to compute the limit for @xmath53 in ( [ 8])-([9 ] ) .",
    "at this aim we should just change the hyperbolic metric ( [ 2 ] ) with parabolic void metric . @xmath54 . \\label{15p}\\ ] ] this case is an interesting one : if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , equation ( [ 7 ] ) implies that @xmath57 .",
    "the latter means that the flat void region described by metric ( [ 15p ] ) should be an underdensity .",
    "equation ( [ 15p ] ) is relevant only to compute the distance - redshift relation , i.e. when considering data on the light cone .",
    "then , we can study equation ( [ 15 ] ) also in the limit @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", we get the @xmath0cdm model by setting @xmath58 ; in another words , at odds with fb model , the @xmath0fb contains the @xmath0cdm model for the aforementioned choice of the parameters .",
    "from equation ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) we have ( for @xmath21 ) : @xmath59 in the original fb model , the parameter @xmath60 is interpreted as a phenomenological lapse function and we have @xmath61 . by consequence , in the fb model the parameter @xmath31 has no role . on the contrary , in our model ( @xmath0fb ) , @xmath60 is not a lapse function but simply a measure of the ratio @xmath62 or in another words of the ratio between the expansion rate of voids and walls . by consequence , @xmath31 is only constrained to be @xmath63 , from the existence of ii member of eq.([8 ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to express , by means of ( [ 15 ] ) , @xmath31 in terms of the other current cosmological parameters .",
    "we have @xmath64 care must be taken to avoid spurious solutions .",
    "in particular , for @xmath65 we generally have one root , the greater one in ( [ 16q ] ) .",
    "the existence of the solution requires @xmath66 , which implies for equation [ 7 ] @xmath57 , i.e. a non positive backreaction .",
    "this is a check of the consistency of the model , since the partition chosen with voids with an average negative curvature should imply a non positive backreaction , as it is .",

    "the observations imply @xmath69 .",
    "remember that within the buchert scheme , this limit can also be taken into account , provided that it is intended as a mean quantity .",
    "such small value is also consistent with the inflationary scenario . on the contrary in void models ,",
    "the curvature acts as an effective dark energy . for this reason and in order to fit the observational data , void models require a quite large curvature .",
    "such large value has been claimed consistent to the observation of big voids in the large scale structure .",
    "unfortunately such scenario has two additional implications : a low value for the hubble constant and/or the existence of a giant void around our location ( see @xcite ) . both of them appear quite implausible . the present model @xmath0fb on the contrary , since incorporates voids and dark energy , gives the possibility to explore the compatibility between dark energy , large voids , a standard range of values for @xmath70 $ ] and a small value for @xmath67 in agreement with the wmap constraint . from the formula ( [ 16q ] )",

    "+ decreasing @xmath80 in order to get a similar value for @xmath71 , it requires a larger @xmath67 , in agreement with the inhomogeneous models where dark energy is mimicked by the curvature .",
    "+ note that for the same range of parameter values , the backreaction term is @xmath81 and thus remains relatively small .",
    "+ larger values for @xmath82 can be obtained with a small @xmath67 and a reasonable void fraction @xmath71 , for a smaller @xmath80 , but a larger @xmath83 value .",
    "it is worth to stress that our result is not a validation of the standard value for @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , the current standard constraint @xmath84 is obtained within the friedmann paradigm .",
    "a larger value @xmath85 can fit as well the experimental data ( cmb and bao ) , but it is at odds with inflationary paradigm .",
    "our result is indeed a falsification of a common claim , i.e. large density contrast @xmath86 due to voids necessarily implies a large curvature contrast @xmath87 . in our model a large fraction of voids is compatible with a small spatial curvature and a standard value for cosmological constant .",

    "one of the issue of the buchert averaging scheme is how to relate volume average quantities which are non - local to observable ones , which are local .",
    "in contrast to many approaches to the buchert equations which usually neglect this fundamental issue and following wiltshire @xcite , we match the radial null section of the wall metric ( [ 1 ] ) , rewritten as @xmath102\\label{s1}\\\\          & = & -dt^2+\\frac{{(1-f_v)}^{\\frac{2}{3}}a^2}{f_{wi}^{\\frac{2}{3 } } }            \\left[d{\\eta}_w^2+{\\eta}_w^2d{\\omega}^2\\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the metric at the scale of homogeneity given by @xmath103 @xmath104 is an area function satisfying @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the particle horizon radius .",
    "practically , the wall observer must dress the cosmological parameter and not simply to relate the volume average scale factor to the observed redshift @xmath107 .",

    "we can see that @xmath115 has the same functional form versus the time @xmath44 both for @xmath0cdm and @xmath0fb models .",
    "the only difference is the expression of the function @xmath36 .",
    "obviously the expression for @xmath115 changes with respect to the concordance model when expressed in terms of the redshift @xmath107 . to express @xmath116 along the past null cone , we must to know the function @xmath16 which , for the @xmath0fb model can be obtained by integrating numerically the equations ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "we have presented a preliminary study of the recent @xmath0fb cosmological model . an explicit formula relating all the cosmological parameters of the @xmath0fb model is obtained and analyzed .",
    "the relevant feature of the @xmath0fb model is the presence of the cosmological constant and spatial inhomogeneities without spherical symmetry @xcite . by consequence",
    ", the standard @xmath0cdm model can be recovered with a suitable choice of the parameters .",
    "the model allows to analyse the departures from the standard cosmological model without invoking perturbation theory .",
    "+ the first result of the present study is the consistency of a large volume voids fraction ( @xmath117 ) with a small spatial curvature , even within wmap constraint ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this falsifies the argument often used in the literature to rule out dark energy , i.e. a large fraction of voids observed necessarily implies a large negative value for the curvature .",
    "+ the second result is the important role ( absent in the fb model ) of the initial volume void fraction @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , for a reasonable range of values for the cosmological parameters @xmath118 and dependent on the parameter @xmath31 , the model generally provides two possibles values for the current volume void fraction : @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "if the initial value @xmath121 , then the universe evolves up to a final volume void fraction @xmath122 , while for @xmath123 the system evolves up to the second root @xmath124 . as it is evident from the table ( [ voids ] ) , the model is quite sensitive to small variations of cosmological parameters . finally , we analysed the formula ( [ l1 ] ) giving the exact value for @xmath80 in terms of the other current cosmological parameters .",
    "setting the maximum value allowed for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , we get ( see figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] ) that the lower value for @xmath127 is compatible with a volume void fraction @xmath128 .",
    "hence , considering a total amount of dark energy @xmath129 predicted by the @xmath0cdm model , the inhomogeneities could account for a maximum percentage @xmath130 of @xmath80 .",
    "+ as a final consideration , note that also in the @xmath0fb model it is possible to add clock effects present in @xcite .",
    "this can be done simply by considering @xmath60 as a lapse function together with @xmath131 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "equations ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 9 ] ) and formula ( [ 15 ] ) are left unchanged .",
    "the changes are in the dressing procedure , i.e. equations ( [ s1])-([s6 ] ) . moreover , in the case of non vanishing lapse function the cosmological parameters must be dressed @xcite . as an example , if clock effects are present , @xmath132 is the bare volume - average density parameter while the measured density parameter in walls @xmath133 is given by @xmath134 .",
    "this is a preliminary parametric study on the relation between cosmological parameters at the present time . in a future paper",

    "<S> the distribution of matter in the universe shows a complex pattern , formed by cluster of galaxies , voids and filaments denoted as cosmic web . </S>",
    "<S> different approaches have been proposed to model such structure in the framework of the general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> recently , one of us has proposed a generalization ( @xmath0fb model ) of the fractal bubble model , proposed by wiltshire , which accounts for such large scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0fb model is an evolution of fb model and includes in a consistent way a description of inhomogeneous matter distribution and a @xmath0 term . </S>",
    "<S> here we analyze the @xmath0fb model focusing on the relation between cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is the consistency of @xmath0cdm model values for @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) with a large fraction of voids . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to quantify to which extent the inhomogeneous structure could account for @xmath0 constant consistently with standard values of the other cosmological parameters .    </S>",
