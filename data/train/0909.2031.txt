    "the ratio of the mass and magnetic flux of interstellar molecular clouds has received well - deserved observational attention in recent years ( e.g. , crutcher 1999 ; heiles & crutcher 2005 ) . for a cloud as a whole",
    ", the mass - to - flux ratio is an important _ input _ to the ambipolar - diffusion theory of fragmentation ( or core formation ) in molecular clouds ( e.g. , see fiedler & mouschovias 1992 , eq . [ 8 ] ; 1993 , eq .",
    "[ 1c ] and associated discussion ) .",
    "what the ambipolar - diffusion theory _ predicts _ is the mass - to - flux ratio of _ fragments _ ( or _ cores _ ) in molecular clouds and how this quantity evolves in time from typical densities @xmath0 to densities @xmath1 ( tassis & mouschovias 2007 ) .",
    "observations have been in excellent quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions in that the mass - to - flux ratio _ of cores _ is found to be supercritical by a factor 1 - 4 ( crutcher et al .  1994 ; crutcher 1999 and correction by shu et al .  1999 , pp .",
    "196 - 198 ; ciolek & basu 2000 ; troland & crutcher 2008 ; falgarone et al .",
    "by contrast , simulations of turbulence - driven fragmentation do not find cores with systematically greater mass - to - flux ratios than those of their parent clouds ( e.g. , lunttila et al .",
    "therefore , the effort by crutcher et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( hereinafter cht ) to measure the variation of the mass - to - flux ratio from the envelopes to the cores of four molecular clouds and thereby constrain cloud - fragmentation theories is a much needed observational test .",
    "the effort by cht to measure the magnetic field in four cloud envelopes yielded mostly nondetections , allowing only the placement of weak upper limits . also , the data are suggestive of spatial variations of the field in the cloud envelopes .",
    "this spatial variation must be explicitly treated in the data analysis . instead , cht performed an analysis based on the overly restrictive ( and contradicted by the data ) assumption of uniform magnetic field in the envelope , which minimizes the potentially constraining power of their observations .",
    "cht attempt to justify their restrictive assumption by claiming that they are testing the `` idealized ambipolar - diffusion model '' that assumes initially straight - parallel field lines in the parent cloud .",
    "thus , if the data and the data analysis in cht are taken at face value , they at best test an _ input _ to a theory , not the prediction of the theory relating to the variation of the mass - to - flux ratio from a core to its envelope , _ given _ the field strength and its spatial variation in the envelope . as we show below , the geometry of the field lines in a parent cloud crucially affects the _ observed _ variation of the mass - to - flux ratio from a core to the envelope while the fundamental prediction of the ambipolar - diffusion theory ( that the mass - to - flux ratio increases from the envelope to the core ) remains unchanged .    in this letter , we present a novel analysis of the oh - zeeman data , applicable also to other sets of data that show intrinsic variation of the quantity being measured .",
    "the cht data consist of existing oh zeeman measurements in four molecular cloud cores and of four new measurements in the region surrounding each of these cores ( in the clouds l1448 , b217 - 2 , l1544 , and b1 ) . for each observation of an envelope s line - of - sight magnetic field @xmath2 , cht quote an associated gaussian uncertainty @xmath3 .",
    "these four values for each cloud envelope are shown in table [ crutable ] , col . 2 - 5 ( taken from cht figs . 2 - 5 ) .",

    ", we can derive the probability distribution of the parameter of interest ( @xmath12 ) _ while still allowing for all possible values in @xmath13 _ , rather than arbitrarily demanding that @xmath16 ( as in the cht analysis ) .",
    "the integrated likelihood is called the _ marginalized likelihood _ , @xmath17 ; this probability distribution can then be used to derive confidence intervals and upper limits where appropriate .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) @xmath17 for the four clouds is shown in figures 3a - 3d .",
    "@xmath17 is derived by numerically integrating equation ( [ likelihood ] ) over @xmath13 for different values of @xmath12 , and is shown as a solid curve in the four figures ; the location of the maximum - likelihood estimate for the mean @xmath12 is marked by a heavy vertical line in each figure .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimates and associated uncertainties of @xmath12 for the four cht clouds are shown in table [ statable ] .",
    "the uncertainties are systematically greater than those quoted by cht .",
    "the @xmath18 uncertainties are represented by the widths of the dark shaded ( solid blue ) boxes in figures 3a - 3d . for comparison",
    "we show , as cross - hatched boxes , the @xmath18 spreads of the values of @xmath12 that cht quote for the same clouds , based on the same data .",
    "upper limits for @xmath19 can also be calculated using @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath20 upper limits for the envelope magnetic field are given in table [ statable ] .",
    "( the @xmath20 upper limit is that value of @xmath19 for which a fractional area equivalent to the gaussian @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is included under the marginalized likelihood curve between @xmath22 and @xmath19 .",
    "note that this is _ not _ the maximum - likelihood value of @xmath12 plus two times the error .",
    "in addition , @xmath17 has much longer tails than a gaussian , and hence @xmath18 , @xmath23 values do not scale linearly . )",

    "[ marginalized],width=336 ]    to correctly propagate uncertainties onto the derived quantity @xmath5 , we do a full monte - carlo calculation to derive the probability distribution for the values of @xmath5 as follows .",
    "we repeat the following experiment @xmath24 times : we draw @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 from gaussian distributions with mean and spread equal to the measurement and uncertainty quoted in cht ; we draw a mean value of @xmath30 from the marginalized likelihood of the previous section ; we combine all the `` mock observations '' of these numbers to produce one value of @xmath5 .",
    "we use the @xmath24 values of @xmath5 produced in this way to numerically calculate the probability distribution for @xmath5 .",
    "we then calculate the @xmath20 upper limit on @xmath31 by requiring that the fractional integral of this distribution between @xmath32 and @xmath33 be @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath20 upper limits for @xmath31 are given in table [ statable ] , last column .",
    "these limits are not very strong : _",
    "@xmath31 is constrained to be smaller than a few , and for no cloud is the upper limit smaller than @xmath34 _ @xmath35 in sharp contrast to the cht conclusion , that @xmath5 is in the range 0.02 - 0.42 in the four observed clouds .    in our analysis",
    ", we relaxed only _",
    "one _ of the cht assumptions ( that of lack of spatial variation of @xmath30 , which is not consistent with the data ) .",
    "we have retained the implicit assumption of similar orientations of the _ net _ @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( _ vectors _ ) , because the data do not suggest any particular relative orientation of the two vectors . a more general analysis that would also relax this assumption",
    "would increase the uncertainties on @xmath5 ( although not on @xmath30 ) and would further part from the cht conclusions .",
    "we have presented a self - consistent analysis of recent oh zeeman observations by crutcher et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and have shown how such data can be combined in a statistically robust manner to obtain constraints on the mass - to - flux ratio contrast ( @xmath5 ) between molecular cloud cores and envelopes .",
    "our analysis extends the constraining power of such measurements to realistic clouds , beyond the overly restrictive assumption of straight - parallel field lines in cloud envelopes , adopted by cht .",
    "we have shown that the cht data are not of good enough quality to constrain the ratio @xmath5 and thereby test molecular - cloud fragmentation theories : ( i ) more integration time is needed to reduce measurement errors ( now most measurements of @xmath30 yield only upper limits ) ; and ( ii ) more measurements ( instead of only four ) in each envelope are needed to better constrain the intrinsic spatial variation of @xmath30 . this kind of observations coupled with the method of data analysis we presented in this _",
