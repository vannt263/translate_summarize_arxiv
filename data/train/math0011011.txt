    "in the early seventies , alan weinstein proved the following result which was subsequently reproved by jurgen moser ( using different methods ) and is now known as the weinstein - moser theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "[ thm : wm ] let @xmath0 be a smooth function on a symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "then the hamiltonian flow of @xmath0 has at least @xmath2 periodic orbits on all level sets sufficiently close to a nondegenerate extremum point of @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to extend this result from extremal points to higher dimensional extrema of the hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , we consider the case of symplectic extremal submanifolds .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a smooth function on a symplectic manifold @xmath3 such that @xmath0 reaches an extremum at a compact symplectic bott - nondegenerate submanifold @xmath4 we prove the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] the hamiltonian flow defined on @xmath3 by the function @xmath0 has at least one periodic orbit on a sequence of energy levels converging to @xmath5 .    in comparing these theorems , we see that here the existence of periodic orbits for all sufficiently close level sets is weakened to existence on a sequence of level sets approaching @xmath5 .",
    "we also note that the lower bound for the number of periodic orbits is replaced by simple existence .",
    "it is unlikely that this result is sharp .",
    "( the uncertainty as to where the true boundaries of such existence results should lie is indicative of a lack of examples in this area . )",
    "however , other existence results of this kind have recently been obtained , see @xcite ( theorem [ thm : po ] below ) and @xcite . moreover , a result that is similar in strength to the weinstein - moser theorem can be proved if one imposes certain compatibility conditions on @xmath6 and the hessian of @xmath0 on @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , in @xcite it is shown that under such assumptions there are at least @xmath7 periodic orbits on all level sets sufficiently close to @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the cup - length of @xmath5 over @xmath9 .",
    "the question addressed here is motivated further by the following interesting set of examples .",
    "let @xmath10 be a compact symplectic manifold and @xmath11 a riemannian metric on @xmath5 .",
    "consider the hamiltonian flow defined on @xmath12 by the kinetic energy hamiltonian @xmath13 and the twisted symplectic from @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the projection map and @xmath16 is the canonical liouville one - form .",
    "these flows describe the motion of a charged particle in a nondegenerate magnetic field and will be referred to as symplectic magnetic flows .",
    "the zero section of @xmath12 is a symplectic minimum of @xmath17 and in the context of the result above we are concerned with the existence of periodic orbits on low energy levels . for such flows ,",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] implies the following result .    for any symplectic form @xmath18 and metric @xmath11 on @xmath5 ,",
    "the corresponding symplectic magnetic flow has periodic orbits on a sequence of low energy levels converging to zero .    to the knowledge of the authors , this is the most general existence result for symplectic magnetic flows .",
    "however , much stronger results have been established in a variety of different cases .",
    "let @xmath5 be a surface of genus @xmath19 .",
    "then for any choice of @xmath18 and @xmath11 , the corresponding symplectic magnetic flow has at least three periodic orbits on all sufficiently low energy levels and at least @xmath20 if they are nondegenerate .",
    "let the metric @xmath11 be of the form @xmath21 for some almost complex structure @xmath22 on @xmath5 .",
    "then the corresponding symplectic magnetic flow has at least @xmath23 periodic orbits on all sufficiently low energy levels and at least @xmath24 if all orbits are nondegenerate . here",
    "@xmath24 denotes the sum of betti numbers of @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , the construction above produces a hamiltonian flow from any manifold @xmath5 , closed two - form @xmath18 and metric @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath18 can be degenerate .",
    "we call these flows magnetic flows and refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion of them and further references .",
    "the following are recent results for magnetic flows which also hold in the symplectic case .    for any closed two - form @xmath18 and metric @xmath11 on @xmath25 ,",
    "the corresponding magnetic flow has periodic orbits on almost all energy levels .",
    "( in fact , bounded neighborhoods of the zero section have finite hofer  zehnder capacity . )",
    "[ thm : po ] for any metric on @xmath5 and any nonzero weakly - exact is called weakly - exact if @xmath18 is closed and @xmath26|_{\\pi_2(m)}=0 $ ] . ] two - form , the corresponding magnetic flow has contractible periodic orbits on a sequence of energy levels converging to zero .    these last two theorems represent interesting applications of tools from other areas of symplectic topology to the existence question .",
    "the first result is a direct application of the work on the hofer ",
    "zehnder capacity in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second result is proved for @xmath27 by polterovich using hofer s metric on the space of hamiltonian diffeomorphisms ( see @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", he utilizes the relation between the nonminimizing geodesics of hofer s metric and the existence of contractible periodic orbits .",
    "this work is then extended to the more general form , as stated here , by macarini in @xcite .",
    "before starting the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , we recall the variational framework for proving the existence of periodic orbits of the hamiltonian flow of a function @xmath0 on a symplectic manifold @xmath28 .",
    "first we choose a suitable class of loops in @xmath29 , say the frchet manifold of smooth loops , @xmath30 .",
    "then on @xmath30 we consider the one - form @xmath31 which takes @xmath32 , an element of the tangent space at @xmath33 , to @xmath34 it is clear from the least action principle that the zeroes of @xmath31 on @xmath30 are periodic orbits of the hamiltonian flow with period equal to one .    at this point",
    "we are faced with several difficulties .",
    "first among them is the fact that the variational problem is far more tractable if @xmath31 is exact .",
    "for then we may look for the critical points of a functional instead of the zeros of a one - form .",
    "as well , there need not exist closed orbits with period equal to one .",
    "finally , as stated , the variational approach does not allow us to search for periodic orbits on a fixed level set of @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of the limiting dynamics given below suggests that the search for periodic orbits on level sets near @xmath5 can be restricted to the subset of small loops in @xmath30 that lie close to @xmath5 . in making this restriction ,",
    "we are able to overcome the first problem by finding an action functional whose derivative is equal to @xmath31 on this subset .",
    "the restriction also allows us to considerably simplify the analytic setting by using the method developed by weinstein in @xcite to prove the arnold conjecture for @xmath35-small hamiltonians .",
    "the other difficulties are surmounted by adapting a set of techniques developed by viterbo , and hofer and zehnder in @xcite .",
    "namely , we modify the function @xmath0 ( and hence our functional ) to force any periodic orbits on the desired energy levels to have positive action .",
    "then we show that the new action functional has critical points with positive action by using a `` linking argument '' as in @xcite .      for the case when @xmath5 is an extremal point of the function @xmath36 we recall briefly how one begins to look for periodic orbits of the hamiltonian flow of @xmath0 on level sets near @xmath5 .",
    "darboux s theorem allows us to work in a neighborhood of the origin in @xmath37 with the canonical symplectic form @xmath38 . here",
    "the function looks like @xmath39 and we may assume that the origin is a local minimum so that the quadratic form @xmath40 is positive definite .",
    "setting @xmath41 it is easily checked that for @xmath42 the flow of @xmath43 on @xmath44 is diffeomorphic to the flow of the hamiltonian vector field @xmath45 on @xmath46 via the rescaling map @xmath47 .",
    "the vector field @xmath45 is defined by @xmath48 and we see that @xmath49 is a hamiltonian perturbation of the linear hamiltonian vector field @xmath50 given by the equation @xmath51 since @xmath40 is positive definite , there exists a change of variable @xmath52 which preserves @xmath38 and puts @xmath40 in the form @xmath53 see @xcite . in these coordinates it becomes clear that @xmath50 describes the quasiperiodic motion of @xmath2 uncoupled harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath54 .",
    "the problem then reduces to showing that the periodic `` normal modes '' of the linear system persist under the perturbation @xmath45 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in replacing a critical point by a critical submanifold @xmath5 we will rescale globally in the normal directions to @xmath5 and show that we still get a well - defined and useful limiting vector field .",
    "setting @xmath55 , the tubular neighborhood theorem allows us to assume that , for sufficiently small @xmath56 , the level sets @xmath57 lie in a neighborhood of the zero section in the total space of a normal bundle @xmath58 to @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , we may replace the manifold @xmath29 by this neighborhood which we will still denote by @xmath29 .",
    "we choose the normal bundle to be @xmath59 , the symplectic orthogonal complement to @xmath60 .",
    "by weinstein s symplectic neighborhood theorem ( see @xcite ) we may also assume that @xmath6 restricts to the fibres in @xmath61 as a constant linear symplectic form , @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the level sets of interest lie in a symplectic vector bundle which is also equipped with a fibrewise positive - definite quadratic form @xmath63 , given by the hessian of @xmath0 in the normal directions to @xmath5 .",
    "as above , there exist coordinates @xmath64 in each fibre @xmath65 such that @xmath66 is the canonical symplectic form on @xmath67 and @xmath68 note that in general these coordinates are not unique and can not be chosen to depend smoothly or even continuously on @xmath69 . however ,",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath70 of @xmath71 with respect to @xmath72 are well defined .    starting with the hamiltonian dynamical system defined on @xmath73 by @xmath74 we let @xmath75 be the global fibrewise dilation by a factor of @xmath76 , and set @xmath77 and @xmath78 after this rescaling the new hamiltonian dynamical system is given by @xmath79    [ lemma : lemma1 ]    as @xmath80",
    ", @xmath81 approaches a fibrewise , quasiperiodic vector field @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , in each fibre @xmath65 , the vector field @xmath50 is the ( linear ) hamiltonian vector field of the positive - definite form @xmath82 with respect to the symplectic form @xmath83 .",
    "one can check that the fibre components of the @xmath84 are independent of @xmath85 and equal to @xmath86 however , the limit of the @xmath84 as @xmath87 is not defined , i.e. in coordinates , all the terms with components along the base blow up in the limit . using the bundle isomorphisms @xmath88 defined by each of the nondegenerate forms @xmath84 , we can construct the dual bivectors @xmath89 ( we include the negative sign because if we associate to @xmath90 a nondegenerate skew - symmetric matrix , then to the dual bivector at @xmath91 we associate the negative inverse of this matrix . )",
    "these bivectors are nondegenerate poisson structures and we may rewrite equation ( [ eq : dyn ] ) as @xmath92.\\ ] ]    in contrast to the @xmath84 the poisson structures @xmath93 do have a well defined limit , @xmath94 .",
    "this is a degenerate poisson structure whose symplectic leaves are the fibres of @xmath58 . as well , for @xmath87 we have @xmath95 .",
    "hence , @xmath96,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 denotes the exterior derivative with respect to just the fibre variables .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath98 indeed , this equation defines the limiting vector field @xmath50 globally and we note that the convergence of @xmath81 to @xmath50 is @xmath99 for any @xmath19 .    by equation ( [ eq : quasi ] )",
    "the flow of @xmath50 is fibrewise quasiperiodic and we have at least @xmath100 periodic orbits in each fibre .    by lemma [ lemma : lemma1 ]",
    ", the flow on the level @xmath101 can be viewed ( up to parameterization ) as a small ( hamiltonian ) perturbation of the quasiperiodic flow of @xmath50 on @xmath102 .",
    "hence , one may expect that under this perturbation the set of periodic orbits of @xmath50 on @xmath102 ( called the normal modes of @xmath50 following @xcite ) splits into periodic orbits on @xmath101 whose number is bounded from below by the cup - length or the sum of betti numbers of this set .",
    "these invariants depend on the pair of fibrewise forms @xmath63 and @xmath62 but should be greater than or equal to the corresponding invariants of @xmath5 .    when the eigenvalues @xmath70 do not bifurcate as functions of the parameter @xmath103 , the set of normal modes of @xmath50 is an orbifold , @xcite .",
    "in this case the perturbative analysis can indeed be carried out by adapting moser s method , see @xcite .",
    "this leads to a lower bound on the number of periodic orbits in terms of the cup - length , @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when for every @xmath69 the eigenvalues @xmath70 are equal to each other , a lower bound in terms of the sum of betti numbers of @xmath5 has also been obtained in @xcite .",
    "( this is the case , for example , when @xmath104 . in particular , it is true for symplectic magnetic flows on surfaces , @xcite .",
    "the condition is also satisfied for symplectic magnetic flows in higher dimensions when @xmath105 for some almost complex structure @xmath22 on @xmath5 , @xcite . )    in general , this perturbative approach encounters serious difficulties arising from the fact that the set of normal modes of @xmath50 may fail to be a manifold or an orbifold . in this work the limiting dynamics is used only as motivation .",
    "expecting some of the normal modes of the limiting vector field @xmath50 to always persist under the hamiltonian perturbation @xmath81 , we will restrict our search for periodic orbits to small loops near @xmath5 .",
    "this will considerably simplify the original variational problem .    to begin with , we fix some geometric structure on @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath22 be an almost complex structure that is compatible with @xmath6 .",
    "this yields the riemannian metric @xmath107 on @xmath29 . with the splitting",
    "@xmath108 we then have the decomposition @xmath109 where the subscripts @xmath110 and @xmath58 denote tangential and normal components , respectively .",
    "with respect to this splitting we will write @xmath111 for @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114      following @xcite , we note the existence of a darboux family for @xmath115 .",
    "this a parameterized version of a darboux chart .",
    "it consists of a neighborhood @xmath116 of the zero section in @xmath106 and a mapping @xmath117 onto a neighborhood @xmath118 of @xmath119 such that the following conditions hold .    1",
    ".   @xmath120 contains the origin .",
    "2 .   @xmath121 is a symplectomorphism from @xmath122 to @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is an open neighborhood of @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 is the identity .",
    "in addition , we may assume that all neighborhoods @xmath128 are open balls of a fixed radius with respect to @xmath129 .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath130 , we may also assume that the level set @xmath101 lies in @xmath118 .",
    "denote by @xmath131 the open subset of @xmath30 consisting of small loops contained in @xmath118 .",
    "this is an open neighborhood of the constant loops in @xmath118 .",
    "based on our analysis of the limiting dynamics , this is also where we expect to find low energy periodic orbits .",
    "now , let @xmath132 be the space of @xmath133 loops in @xmath134 whose projections to @xmath135 have zero mean , and consider the frchet space bundle @xmath136 the map @xmath137 pulls back @xmath131 onto an open neighborhood @xmath138 of the zero section in @xmath139 , which in each fibre @xmath132 consists of loops contained in @xmath128 .",
    "this follows from the inverse function theorem and , put another way , is essentially the fact that any small loop in @xmath5 has a unique mean value in @xmath5 with respect to the map @xmath137 . to be more precise , for every @xmath140",
    ", there exists a unique @xmath141 such that @xmath142 for some loop @xmath143 which takes values in @xmath128 .",
    "since @xmath6 is exact in a neighborhood of any of the loops in @xmath131 , the differential form @xmath144 is exact and so is its pullback by @xmath137 .",
    "( indeed , the second term in is always exact and the symplectic area of a small disc bounded by the loop can be taken as a primitive of the first term . )",
    "we denote the primitive of @xmath145 by @xmath146 and remark that @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the restriction to @xmath149 and is given by @xmath150 this is just the standard action functional for the hamiltonian @xmath151 which is defined on the open subset @xmath128 of the symplectic vector space @xmath152 . in particular , as above , the first term is the symplectic area of the disc bounded by @xmath153 in this space .",
    "we have thus simplified the original variational problem to that of finding a critical point of the functional @xmath146 in @xmath138 ( a neighborhood of the zero section in the frchet space bundle @xmath154 ) .",
