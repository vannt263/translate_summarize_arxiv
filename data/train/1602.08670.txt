    "as many observations show that star formation efficiency varies by @xmath3 100 times from galaxy to galaxy , increasing attention has been devoted to the questions of whether giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) properties are universal and whether their star formation ability depends on the large - scale galactic environment .",
    "the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) observations are starting to resolve a wide population of gmcs with the quality of that in the milky way .",
    "this gives a chance to reveal the whole picture of the relation between gmcs and star formation in various environments .",
    "to interpret the measured gmc properties properly , it is necessary to understand any observational bias on the gmc properties .",

    "observations take data from the galaxies projected on the sky plane .",
    "this provides two spatial dimensions ( ra and dec . ) and a velocity along the line of sight ( los ) , known as the spectral data cube in position - position - velocity space ( ppv ) . however , the non - spherical shapes of gmcs change their appearances when projected along different los , which are determined by the inclination and position angle of the host galactic disc .",
    "moreover , galaxies are distributed over a wide range in distance in the universe , causing the physical resolution of observations to not always be the same .",
    "finite resolution will necessarily introduce contributions from separated adjacent structures to the measured gmc properties .",
    "these effects are assessable by comparing gmc properties in observations to simulations .",
    "simulations normally have data with three - dimensional position ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and velocity ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) coordinates , so called position - position - position space ( ppp ) , from which gmc properties can be directly calculated . in previous work , we compared the physical properties of the gmcs identified in ppp and those in ppv in the same simulated galaxy , assuming ideal circumstances , i.e. , face - on observation with high resolution ( 1.5 pc ) and sensitivity ( 1 k per 1 km s@xmath11 ) @xcite .",
    "the results show that ppp and ppv can potentially identify the same objects with closely matched properties within a scattering in value of a factor of 2 .",
    "yet such high resolution and sensitivity are very difficult to achieve in extragalactic observations even with alma .    in this work",
    ", we further evaluate the effects of galactic disc inclination and observed resolution .",
    "as in @xcite , this is done by comparing gmcs in ppp and ppv .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "method and datasets are introduced in section [ sec_method ] .",
    "the cloud identification methods and the derivation of physical properties are introduced in section [ sec_def_gmc ] .",

    "we summarize the key results of our analysis in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "the simulated galaxies were modelled on the barred spiral ( sabc ) galaxy , m83 , using observational data from the 2mass @xmath12-band image to estimate the stellar potential .",
    "the simulations were run using the three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamics code , enzo @xcite . the high - resolution ( 1.5 pc )",
    "simulation is presented in @xcite , along with a full description of the run parameters .",
    "the gas radiatively cooled down to 300 k but no star formation or feedback was included .",
    "typical temperatures in the gmcs are about 10 k , an order of magnitude below our minimum radiative cooling temperature",
    ". however , our resolution is not sufficient to resolve the full turbulent structure of the gas and we also do not include pressure from magnetic fields .",
    "including a temperature floor of 300k therefore imposes a minimum sound speed of 1.8 km s@xmath11 on the gas to crudely allow for these effects .",
    "the velocity dispersion within our gmcs is typically higher than this by about a factor of 2  3 , implying that this floor does not have a significant impact on the cloud properties .",
    "previous work that has compared runs with and without star formation and feedback physics suggest that gmc properties are not strongly affected by these additions .",
    "we have therefore not included a star formation model in this work , focusing on the properties of the gas @xcite .",
    "face - on and edge - on projection images of the high - resolution simulated galaxy are shown in the bottom and top panels of figure [ fig_sim_galaxy ] . to assess the resolution effect , a low - resolution ( 24 pc ) simulation was made by decreasing the total levels of refinement .",
    "the remaining run parameters are the same as in the high - resolution simulation .",
    "there are six datasets in total , summarized in table [ tab_suumary_data ] .",
    "data structure of ppp , edge - on observation in ppv , and face - on observation in ppv are prepared .",
    "each dataset is produced at two resolutions : 1.5 pc ( with 1 km s@xmath11 for ppv velocity axis ) and @xmath3 24 pc ( with 2 km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the high- and low - resolution ppp data using the aforementioned two simulations are presented as ppp@xmath13 and ppp@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the los of ppv data is the @xmath7-axis for the face - on case , and @xmath6-axis for the edge - on case .",
    "the chosen resolutions will return clouds with fully and barely resolved properties respectively if the simulated clouds have properties similar to the galactic gmcs .",
    "velocity resolutions are chosen so that the smallest clouds in both spatial resolutions can span across 2  3 velocity channels if following the larson s relation ( cf.,[secsec_larson ] ) .",
    "the high - resolution ppv data are created from the high - resolution ( 1.5 pc ) simulation .",
    "the pixel size matches to cell size at 1.5 pc .",
    "when identifying gmcs in the ppv dataset , we assume the galaxy is observed in @xmath4co ( 10 ) ( 115.2 ghz ) , the most commonly used transition for gmc observations .",
    "therefore , only cells with a density greater than 100 @xmath15 were included in the data , corresponding to the excitation density of @xmath4co ( 10 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the cloud identification of the ppp clouds , which selected using a continuous contour at a density of 100 @xmath15 .",
    "the cloud identification algorithm of ppv expects the data to be emission intensity , rather than the gas density followed by simulations .",
    "we use a galactic co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor ( @xmath16 ) of 2 @xmath17 10@xmath18 @xmath19 ( k km s@xmath11)@xmath11 @xcite to convert between the two .",
    "since we do not consider chemistry nor radiative transfer and the excitation of molecular lines , the conversion factor cancels when we derive the cloud mass , so its precise value does not affect our results .",
    "this also means that we have a more accurate mass measurement than real observations , and this work is thus an assessment purely for the unavoidable effects of projection , resolution , sensitivity and cloud identification method in observations , i.e. , any discrepancy between the datasets can be largely attributed to these effects .",

    "therefore , even though the range and profile of the cloud mass in ppv@xmath21 do not deviate significantly from that of ppp@xmath13 and ppv@xmath20 overall , this should not lead to the interpretation that the cloud mass between the three data sets are the same .",
    "the cloud radii identified in ppv@xmath21 are smaller compared to the other two datasets ( figure [ fig_pdf_rad ] ) .",

    "it can be seen from panel ( b ) that clouds are flat in the @xmath7-axis , and consequently , the slice and projection plots of ppv@xmath20 ( panel ( a ) and ( c ) ) show higher similarity and less crowding due to the small depth of the los , and vice versa for panel ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "the gas scaleheight of our simulated galaxy is about 80 - 115 pc , which is similar to the initial value of 100 pc due to the lack of stellar feedback to inject energy ; nevertheless , recent observations of edge - on spiral galaxies show that the scaleheights of molecular gas traced by @xmath4co ( 1-0 ) are mostly @xmath24 150 pc @xcite , so this effect replicates true observations as well .",

    "all of methods suggest a median value of @xmath3 5 km s@xmath11 .    in the analysis of this simulation using the same cloud identification method",
    ", @xcite found that ppp@xmath13 clouds fall into three populations : the most common ` type a ' clouds , with properties that corresponded to the average values measured in observations , the ` type b ' massive giant molecular cloud associations that formed during repeated mergers of smaller clouds , and the transient ` type c ' that were born in tidal tails and filaments .",
    "the three types result in the bimodal distribution of cloud surface density ( @xmath38 ) at @xmath3 1000 m@xmath30 pc@xmath51 ( ` type a ' and ` type b ' ) and @xmath3 100 @xmath52 pc@xmath51 ( ` type c ' ) as seen in the @xmath38 profile of ppp@xmath50 ( figure [ fig_pdf_sd ] ) .",

    "fractions of each cloud type in the entire galaxy differ by less than 10% between ppp@xmath13 and ppv@xmath20 @xcite . moreover , among the clouds that have a direct match in both datasets , @xmath3 80% are categorized as same type between these two data structures . on the contrary ,",
    "the bimodal @xmath38 is barely seen in ppv@xmath21 , presumably due to the decrease of cloud radius and cloud blending that increases @xmath38 . for the former effect",
    ", we would expect an increase of @xmath38 for all gmcs , but it is not the case for the high-@xmath38 population since the peak of its 1d profile is close to other two datasets .",
    "therefore , the cloud blending is likely in charge of the missing bimodal-@xmath38 in ppv@xmath21 , with the small transient populations most susceptible to blending .",
    "the median value of @xmath39 @xmath42 1 indicates that the majority of the clouds are bound in all three datasets .",
    "the main difference is the extension of the profiles to lower values of @xmath39 in two ppv@xmath13 sets .",
    "the discrepancy arises because of the underestimation of cloud velocity dispersion in ppv@xmath20 and cloud radius in ppv@xmath21 when the los goes along the short and long dimension of the clouds , respectively . .",
    "in this section , we compare the low - resolution cloud properties between ppp@xmath14 , ppv@xmath14 . we emphasize again that the low - resolution ppp and ppv clouds are identified from different simulations (  [ sec_intro ] and table [ tab_suumary_data ] ) due to the different origin of `` resolution '' . in simulations ,",
    "resolution is set by the amr level , which locally refines the mesh to where they are needed . on the other hand ,",
    "resolution is determined by the size of the beam that is used for convolving an object with finite ( high ) resolution in observation .",
    "we start with the result of the ppp clouds , since it illustrates the blending effect without any influence of the cataloging algorithms .",
    "in other words , it represents the best possible case , though it is observationally infeasible .",
    "the property and galactocentric profiles are shown in the lower panels of figure [ fig_pdf_mass ]  [ fig_pdf_alpha ] and figure [ fig_radial_pp4number](b ) .",
    "line styles and colors are the same as in the high - resolution plots .    the number of ppp@xmath14 clouds is smaller than that of ppp@xmath13 .",
    "this is a result of fewer refinement levels . in spite of the different cloud numbers ,",
    "both resolutions show an accumulations of clouds at the bar ( @xmath53 @xmath42 3 kpc ) and spiral ( @xmath53 @xmath42 6  8 kpc ) regions in figure [ fig_radial_pp4number](b ) .",
    "this suggests that although the blending effect may alter cloud properties , simulations can potentially see the spatial distribution of clouds regardless of resolution .    for the cloud mass distribution in figure [ fig_pdf_mass ] ,",
    "the range of the profiles are comparable between ppp@xmath13 and ppp@xmath14 , but ppp@xmath14 sees more massive clouds at @xmath3 10@xmath54 m@xmath30 and fewer small clouds at @xmath24 2 @xmath17 10@xmath47 m@xmath30 as a result of cloud blending .",
    "the median mass then increases by @xmath3 5 times from ppp@xmath13 to ppp@xmath14 .",
    "the median cloud radius ( figure [ fig_pdf_rad ] ) also increases to @xmath3 40 pc in ppp@xmath14 .",
    "this is because the cells in the low resolution simulation are larger , so clouds blend to become extended structures .",
    "resolution does not affect the velocity dispersion significantly in figure [ fig_pdf_rad ] , where the range and profile of the distributions are similar between ppp@xmath14 and ppp@xmath13 .",
    "@xmath38 , the surface density , is significantly affected by resolution .",
    "the lower resolution simulation blurs the distinction between the three cloud types as seen in figure [ fig_pdf_sd ] .",
    "ppp@xmath14 show a uniform @xmath38 at @xmath3 200 m@xmath30 pc@xmath51 .",
    "this is in agreement with lower resolution studies performed by @xcite .",
    "the bimodal @xmath38 no longer exists in ppp@xmath14 , suggesting that the clouds formed via different mechanisms ( the three types cloud ) can not be differentiated at 24 pc resolution , even though the cloud properties are extracted directly from 3 dimensions .",
    "the distribution of @xmath39 suggests that the majority of ppp@xmath14 clouds are gravitationally bound as in ppp@xmath13 .",
    "the profile of the distribution is also in good agreement between two resolutions .",
    "therefore , resolution may not be a worrying issue for the dynamical state of ppp clouds .",
    "in addition to the resolution or blending effect , casting into observer space invokes sensitivity and projection effects as well .",
    "here we compare the results between ppv@xmath26 and ppv@xmath25 , as well as their high - resolution counterparts and ppp clouds .    as seen in the high resolution data in figure [ fig_radial_pp4number](a ) ,",
    "the cloud number in the ppv@xmath25 is smaller by a factor of @xmath3 1.5  2 compared to ppv@xmath26 , except for the central 1 kpc area .",
    "moreover , it is notable that the galactocentric distribution of the ppv@xmath25 dataset decreases with radius , while ppv@xmath26 still observe two crowded regions around the galactic bar and spiral arms at @xmath53 @xmath42 2  3 and 6  8 kpc as seen in ppp@xmath14 , but the cloud numbers are not the same .",
    "this implies that with low but realistic resolution , edge - on observation no longer sees the real distribution of clouds , and the comparison between face - on observation ( ppv@xmath26 ) and simulation ( ppp@xmath14 ) should be carried out with great care as well .",
    "the median values of cloud mass in figure [ fig_pdf_mass ] are consistent among ppv@xmath26 , ppv@xmath25 , and ppp@xmath14 within a factor of 2 , but the profile shapes are different . the mass of the ppv@xmath25 clouds are slightly larger than ppv@xmath26 .",
    "ppp@xmath14 shows a wider range in mass compared to ppv@xmath14 at both ends . at the higher end ,",
    "the massive ppp@xmath14 clouds are the result of cloud blending as mentioned above .",
    "this can be seen in the cloud radius shown in figure [ fig_pdf_rad ] as well ( note that this is not exactly the same as convolving the high - resolution simulation to low resolution for making ppv@xmath14 ) . for the lower end , our observational setups of ppv@xmath14 can only extract properties from the clouds with mass @xmath22 5 @xmath17 10@xmath55 m@xmath30 , leading to the absence of small clouds .",
    "if these data were observed with a perfect instrument to a lower noise level or higher sensitivity ( but the same resolution of @xmath3 24 pc ) , e.g. , naively increase the integration time by 100 times , we would then be able to see more small clouds , but most of them do not survive the spatial and/or velocity deconvolution in cprops . therefore , to obtain the small clouds ( the type c clouds ) , both high resolution and high sensitivity are needed .",
    "a caution that arises from this comparison is that the difference in the median mass among ppv@xmath26 , ppv@xmath25 , and ppp@xmath14 are unlikely to be found in real observations .",
    "the differences are comparable to the uncertainty of @xmath16 derived from various methods ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) , i.e. , projection effects can be obscured by adopting a different @xmath16 .",
    "we should bear in mind this essential point when comparing gmc properties between galaxies .",
    "the median cloud radius becomes @xmath3 30 pc in ppv@xmath14 as we progress to lower resolution .",
    "the large median value compared to the high - resolution counterpart is mostly due to the cloud blending , but note that small clouds also disappear due to insufficient sensitivity or resolution that pushes the median value toward larger end .",
    "the median radius of ppv@xmath14 is slightly smaller than ppv@xmath13 .",
    "in addition to the blending effect from the mesh refinement , the large value of ppp@xmath14 is due in part to the derivation of cloud radius .",
    "we did not attempt to correct the resolution effect ( e.g. , deconvolution ) in ppp@xmath14 , but keep the same derivation as our previous studies @xcite , while cprops performs spatial deconvolution on cloud radius .",

    "the discrepancy arises maybe because the resolution of @xmath3 24 pc can randomly sample various combination of cloud ( or ism ) structures ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the resolution resolves neither the individual gmcs nor the full cloud mass spectrum , which may be used to interpret the composition of gmcs within an area .",
    "the measured cloud properties are therefore sensitive to their intrinsic properties and the geometry of cloud distribution , which includes the intrinsic and projected distributions .",
    "hence , the derived cloud properties and the scaling relation with this resolution are not entirely driven by the underlying physical origin .",

    "observational bias would alter the gmc properties and larson s relations in different ways if the galaxy type is changed , such as the global morphology and gas content , because they determine the intrinsic distribution and properties of the gmcs .",

    "<S> with alma making it possible to resolve giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in other galaxies , it is becoming necessary to quantify the observational bias on measured gmc properties . using a hydrodynamical simulation of a barred spiral galaxy , we compared the physical properties of gmcs formed in position - position - position space ( ppp ) to the observational position - position - velocity space ( ppv ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assessed the effect of disc inclination : face - on ( ppv@xmath0 ) and edge - on ( ppv@xmath1 ) , and resolution : 1.5 pc versus 24 pc , on gmc properties and the further implications of using larson s scaling relations for mass - radius and velocity dispersion - radius . </S>",
    "<S> the low - resolution ppv data are generated by simulating alma cycle 3 observations using the casa package . </S>",
    "<S> results show that the median properties do not differ strongly between ppp and ppv@xmath0 under both resolutions , but ppv@xmath1 clouds deviate from these two . </S>",
    "<S> the differences become magnified when switching to the lower , but more realistic resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy can lead to opposite results for the virial parameter s measure of gravitational binding , and therefore the dynamical state of the clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the power - law indices for the two larson s scaling relations decrease going from ppp , ppv@xmath1 to ppv@xmath0 and decrease from high to low resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the relations are not entirely driven by the underlying physical origin and therefore have to be used with caution when considering the environmental dependence , dynamical state , and the extragalactic co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor of gmcs .    </S>",
