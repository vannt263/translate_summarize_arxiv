    "localisation in disordered systems has been intensively studied since anderson s pioneering paper sixty years ago  @xcite .",
    "yet there are very few systems for which the calculation of basic quantities such as the localisation length and the density of states can be performed analytically .",
    "this paper presents some new examples where exact calculations are possible .",
    "these examples arise naturally from the study of classical diffusion in a random environment with random absorption or killing . to be more precise , consider a classical one - dimensional diffusion @xmath12 on the real line with infinitesimal ( backward ) generator @xmath13 in this expression , @xmath1 is the drift , and the killing rate @xmath14 describes the absorption properties of the diffusive medium .",
    "we shall be interested in the case where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are noises arising from two independent stochastic processes  : @xmath17 these processes describe the _ environment _ in which the diffusion takes place .",
    "the particular case where @xmath18 is a brownian motion i.e. @xmath15 is a gaussian white noise with mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 and @xmath19 is identicallly zero corresponds to the `` continuum '' version of the random walk in a random environment introduced by sinai @xcite  ; interest in the sinai model spans many fields of science , ranging from mathematics and finance @xcite , to statistical physics @xcite , polymer physics @xcite and population dynamics @xcite .    the effects of absorption in the presence of a random force field were examined recently in @xcite .",
    "the situation of physical interest is that where the process @xmath19 is _ non - decreasing _ , i.e. @xmath16 is positive .",
    "it is also natural to ask that @xmath19 , like the brownian process @xmath18 , be _ markovian _ and have _ stationary increments_. this second condition ensures that @xmath16 , like @xmath15 , is uncorrelated in space and that its distribution is translation invariant .",
    "these natural requirements are fulfilled automatically when @xmath19 is a _",
    "lvy subordinator_. we shall , in  [ sec : models ] , go over the aspects of lvy processes that are most relevant to our study . for the moment , suffice it to say that the absorption rate will take the form @xmath20 where the positions @xmath21 of the absorbers ( or impurities ) are uncorrelated and distributed uniformly with a mean density @xmath5 .",
    "the weight @xmath22 measures the effectiveness of the absorption at the impurity located at @xmath23 .",
    "the probability density of the weights will be denoted by @xmath24 and will be supported on the positive half - line ; the mean value will be denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting absorption process @xmath19 is a particular kind of lvy subordinator known as `` compound poisson process '' @xcite .",
    "as is well - known , the infinitesimal generator gives analytical access to the most important properties of the diffusion @xmath12 .",
    "to illustrate this point , define the transition kernel @xmath26 , conditional on the environment , via   denotes the probability of event @xmath27 occuring . ]",
    "@xmath28 here , @xmath29 denotes the starting point of the diffusion , i.e. @xmath30 , and @xmath31 denotes an interval of infinitesimal length @xmath32 centered on @xmath33 .",
    "for instance , given the environment , the density of the probability that the particle returns at time @xmath34 to its starting point , and the probability that the particle survives beyond time @xmath34 ( i.e. is not absorbed before time @xmath34 ) are given respectively by @xmath35 furthermore @xmath36 solves the backward fokker ",
    "planck ( forward kolmogorov ) equation @xmath37 subject to the initial condition @xmath38 .",
    "since the environment is random , these quantities are themselves random variables , and the difficulty is to compute expectations over the environment .",
    "it turns out that the ( negative of the ) generator @xmath39 is conjugate to the quantum hamiltonian @xmath40 indeed , the generator may be writen as @xmath41 and so it is readily verified that @xmath42 these operators are therefore spectrally equivalent and we may study the diffusion through the quantum system associated with @xmath43 . for a deterministic environment , this approach is well - illustrated by the work of truman _",
    "@xcite  ; for a random environment and hence a disordered quantum system the idea was exploited by bouchaud _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "let us comment briefly on the structure of the hamiltonian  : in the absence of the term @xmath4 , it possesses some underlying symmetry  the so - called _ supersymmetry _ @xcite  encoded in the factorisation @xmath44 where @xmath45 the function @xmath46 appearing in the transformation ( [ conjugacy ] ) then has a clear physical meaning  : in the quantum mechanical formulation , it is a zero mode of the supersymmetric hamiltonian , @xmath47 in the classical diffusion problem , its square @xmath48 , if normalisable , is the equilibrium distribution @xcite . in the quantum hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , the term @xmath4 breaks the supersymmetry .",
    "since our model is a mixture of two noises , it will be helpful to use the following terminology to distinguish between three different kinds of potentials :    1 .",
    "@xmath49 ( _ supersymmetric _ )  ; here , @xmath15 will be a gaussian white noise .",
    "2 .   @xmath50 ( _ scalar _ )  ; here , @xmath50 will be a positive ( non - gaussian ) white noise .",
    "3 .   @xmath51 ( _ mixed _ ) , with @xmath15 and @xmath50 as above .",
    "potentials that are either scalar or supersymmetric will be called _ monolithic_. further details on the nature of the noises @xmath15 and @xmath50 will be given in ",
    "[ sec : models ] .",

    "@xcite have studied the low - energy spectral density of scalar and supersymmetric hamiltonians respectively .",

    "_ , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=47.5% ]    our motivation for studying the mixed case , where _ both _ supersymmetric and scalar disorders are present , is to understand the interplay between two types of disorder each of them , when taken separately , resulting in quite different phenomenologies .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : comparisonsusynieuwenhuizen ] .",
    "this theme has already been touched upon in a paper by hagendorf & texier @xcite , who studied the case where @xmath16 and @xmath15 are gaussian white noises .",
    "the case of correlated gaussian white noises was also discussed more recently in connection with products of random matrices in @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "one concrete goal of the present study is to settle the conjecture that , for the mixed model , @xmath57 for the particular case @xmath53 , texier & hagendorf  @xcite used the ordered spectral statistics  @xcite of the hamiltonian @xmath58 to establish the validity of this formula in the limit of a low density of efficient absorbers , i.e. @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations  @xcite have suggested that this asymptotic formula should remain valid for arbitrary @xmath5 . by using a real space renormalisation group approach",
    ", le  doussal @xcite found , among many other things , the power law in the case @xmath61 , albeit again with the restriction @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the study of a solvable version of the model , free of restrictions on the parameters , is therefore of great interest .",
    "the focus of the paper is the calculation of the _ complex lyapunov exponent _ @xmath64 associated with the disordered hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath9 denotes the usual ( real ) lyapunov exponent that is , the reciprocal of the localisation length and @xmath8 is the integrated density of states ( idos ) per unit length .",
    "both quantities are self - averaging when the sample size goes to infinity .",
    "particular emphasis will be put on the study of @xmath8 because the density of states of the disordered system gives immediate access to the density of the probability that the diffusion returns to its starting point ( see  5 of @xcite or @xcite ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes averaging with respect to the random processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "a secondary aim of the paper is to give a unified description of spectral and localization properties when @xmath16 and @xmath15 are considered separately or combined . to this end",
    ", we use the dyson - schmidt method developed by frisch & lloyd and halperin in the case @xmath67 , and , in  [ sec : methodology ] , show how to adapt it to our situation . in  [ sec : limitingbehaviours ] , we illustrate the approach by recovering straightforwardly the known relevant analytical results for the monolithic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] )",
    ". we also study in some detail certain limits which will serve as points of comparison when we examine the mixed case later on .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to the study of the mixed case , where @xmath18 is a brownian motion with drift @xmath2 and variance  @xmath3 , whilst @xmath19 is a compound poisson process of intensity @xmath5 , with a probability density @xmath24 and a mean @xmath68 for the weights .",
    "we begin , in section  [ sec : mixedcasefixedweights ] , with the case where @xmath19 is a poisson process , i.e. @xmath69  ; this is the situation originally considered in refs .  @xcite .",
    "despite its apparent simplicity , this problem turns out to be a difficult one , and it is only for the particular case where the energy vanishes that we succeed in making some analytical progress .    then , in  [ sec : solvablemixedcase ] , we examine the case where @xmath19 is a compound poisson process with exponentially - distributed jumps .",
    "one of our main result is the discovery of a new solvable case that arises when the mean value @xmath6 of the jumps is related to the strength @xmath3 of the force field via @xmath10 .    in  [ sec : hankelseries ] , we extend the validity of the asymptotic formula ( [ lowenergybehaviour ] ) .",
    "we begin with the study of the exponentially - distributed case for an arbitrary mean @xmath68 .",
    "we show how , in the low energy limit , the problem can be solved in terms of a hankel series whose first few terms we compute explicitly by recurrence .",
    "this hankel series may in fact be viewed as a perturbation expansion around the solvable point @xmath70 .",
    "we then explain how the same approach works also in the general case of an arbitrary distribution of the positive jump heights , with no restriction on the mean @xmath68 .",
    "this demonstrates the advantages of the dyson - schmidt method over the other approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite which are inherently limited to `` small '' regions of the parameter space , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "finally , we elaborate in  [ sec : conclusion ] the implications of our findings for sinai diffusion with random absorbers .",
    "in this section , we review the aspects of the dyson - schmidt method relevant to our particular problem .",
    "the upshot is that , for the particular kind of disorder that we consider , the calculation of the complex lyapunov exponent reduces to the solution of a certain linear second order differential equation  ; this is equation  ( [ eq : fdeq ] ) below .",
    "we call _ lvy process _",
    "any markov process , started at zero , with right - continuous , left - limited paths and stationary independent increments @xcite .",
    "the characteristic function of any lvy process , say @xmath71 , is an exponential of @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath72 furthermore , the _ lvy exponent _ @xmath73 can always be expressed in the form @xmath74 for some numbers @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and some measure @xmath77 such that @xmath78 @xmath77 is called the _ lvy measure _ of the process . when the measure has support @xmath79 ( as happens for example when @xmath80 and the process is a _ subordinator _ ) , it must satisfy @xmath81    the lvy processes that are most relevant to the present study are :    1 .   the _ brownian motion with drift @xmath75 and variance @xmath76_. this corresponds to the case where @xmath82 2 .   the _ poisson process @xmath83 of intensity @xmath5_. in this case , @xmath84 , @xmath80 and @xmath77 is the discrete measure with weight @xmath5 at @xmath85  ; equivalently @xmath86 the corresponding noise takes the form @xmath87 where the partition @xmath88 is such that the spacings @xmath89 are independent and exponentially distributed . in other words , for @xmath90 , @xmath91 this is the situation that would arise if impurities were dropped independently on the positive half - line uniformly at random with mean density  @xmath5 .",

    "form a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables , and @xmath83 is a poisson process of intensity @xmath5 , independent of the @xmath93 .",
    "the corresponding lvy noise now takes the form of a superposition of delta - functions with random weights @xmath94 if we suppose that the distribution of the jumps @xmath93 has a density , say @xmath24 , then the lvy exponent is given by @xmath95 i.e. @xmath96    other more sophisticated examples of lvy processes may be found in @xcite , but they will play no part in what follows .",
    "additional useful statistical properties of lvy noises are discussed in appendix  [ appendix : spln ] .",
    "some of the spectral and localisation properties of the one - dimensional random hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) may be obtained by using the dyson - schmidt method  @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the initial - value problem @xmath97 the study of the statistical properties of @xmath98 is facilitated by the introduction of the riccati variable @xmath99 the schrdinger equation for the wave function @xmath100 , translates into the following first - order non linear equation for the riccati variable : @xmath101 the scalar random potential @xmath16 appears as an _ additive _ noise whereas the random superpotential @xmath15 appears as a _ multiplicative _ noise .",
    "the stochastic differential equation is here to be interpretated in the sense of stratonovich  @xcite . roughly speaking",

    "the first term on the right - hand side of equation ( [ fpefordistributionf ] ) is then a drift term due to the deterministic force acting on the particle .",
    "the following term is a diffusion term associated with the brownian part of the supersymmetric noise .",
