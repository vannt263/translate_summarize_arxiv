    "in two - component fermi systems with attractive interactions , in which both species share the same fermi surface , pair formation is successfully described by the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory  @xcite .",
    "this scenario is , for instance , realized in conventional superconductors , where electrons of opposite spin and momentum form cooper pairs .",
    "in contrast , if the fermi surfaces are different , the situation is subtler because not all of the fermions can form pairs .",
    "the question thus arises as to whether a superfluid phase exists in this setup and if so , what its properties are . on the theoretical side , different answers to this question",
    "have been proposed  @xcite ranging from exotic superfluid phases to more conventional phase separations .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to the so - called fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo , sometimes also denoted loff in the literature ) state , in which fermion pairs with nonzero momentum form an inhomogeneous superfluid phase .",
    "initially developed for superconductors in magnetic fields , this theory has been applied to heavy fermion systems  @xcite and dense quark matter  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , < \" , ]     recent advances in methods for trapping and controlling ultracold atoms have opened up the possibility of experimentally observing population imbalanced mixtures of ultracold fermions  @xcite .",
    "compared to solid state materials , cold gases allow an unprecedented control over the fermi surface mismatch by adjusting the population imbalance @xmath2 here @xmath3 denotes the number of particles in one of two hyperfine states labeled by a pseudo - spin index @xmath4 . so far , these experiments have not revealed any of the proposed exotic superfluids , but have concluded that the system either phase separates , forming an unpaired normal state immersed in a bcs superfluid  @xcite , or forms pairs that do not condense  @xcite . although theoretical studies of the stability and extent of the fflo state in the phase diagram have not yet reached a consensus , it is clear by now that it is best realized at low temperatures and in quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) geometries  @xcite . given the disagreement between theoretical predictions and the difficulty of unambiguously identifying exotic phases encountered in experiments , we believe it lends insight to study the simplest possible system that exhibits fflo - type pairing : the 1d hubbard model with attractive interactions . on the one hand , this system is well suited for theoretical studies because it is exactly solvable via the bethe - ansatz and is numerically exactly treatable in density - matrix - renormalization - group ( dmrg ) simulations .",
    "on the other hand , it has now become possible to realize it experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this paper consists of two parts : in the first , we derive various correlation exponents as a function of the density and the polarization and demonstrate that the superfluid fflo correlations dominate at all polarizations and that there is no chandrasekhar - clogston limit  @xcite in the attractive 1d hubbard model .",
    "we also address the stability of the fflo phase in weakly coupled chains . in the second part",
    ", we calculate the experimentally accessible spatial noise correlations quantitatively for uniform and trapped systems and show that fflo states leave a distinct fingerprint , making it an ideal tool to detect and characterize exotic pairing phases  @xcite .",
    "we concern ourselves with a population - imbalanced 1d fermi gas with attractive interactions , which can be described by the hubbard model @xmath5 here @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion with pseudo - spin @xmath8 on site @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the occupation number operator . the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 characterize the nearest - neighbor hopping and the attractive on - site interaction , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we specify the polarization @xmath13 and the particle density @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the length of the chain .",
    "the physics of the attractive hubbard chain for zero polarization is quite transparent : the on - site attraction @xmath16 favors locally doubly occupied sites .",
    "these doubly occupied sites can lead to @xmath17 charge - density wave ( cdw ) fluctuations and to singlet superfluid ( ss ) fluctuations of pairs with zero momentum .",
    "away from half filling , the pairing fluctuations dominate for all densities when @xmath18 .",
    "since spin excitations are gapped in this phase , spin density wave ( sdw ) and triplet superfluid ( ts ) correlations decay exponentially for @xmath18 .",
    "the correlation functions are defined in table  [ tab : correlations ] .",
    "as soon as the system is polarized , the spin gap closes and all the above - mentioned correlation functions decay as power laws . due to the unequal number of up and down particles , the corresponding fermi vectors @xmath19 are different , and one might expect that the singlet superfluid correlations still remain important , albeit now composed of pairs with finite momentum @xmath20 . this is the prediction of a bosonization analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the attractive hubbard model can be mapped onto the repulsive one under a staggered particle - hole transformation of one of the two species . to be specific ,",
    "let us use the transformation @xmath22 the sector with particle density @xmath23 and polarization @xmath13 of the attractive model maps onto @xmath24 and @xmath25 on the repulsive side ( symbols with a bar denote quantities for the repulsive model ) . under this transformation ,",
    "density correlations in the attractive model map onto longitudinal spin correlations in the repulsive model , while singlet superfluidity is mapped onto transverse spin correlations , see table  [ tab : correlations ] .",
    "the fermi momentum of the transformed species is shifted , @xmath26 , while @xmath27 is left unchanged .        with this correspondence in hand",
    ", we can use the results of frahm and korepin  @xcite on the correlation exponents for the repulsive hubbard model in a magnetic field and translate the behavior of the correlation functions to the attractive case . in general ,",
    "the leading asymptotic behavior of an equal - time correlator can be written as @xmath28 where the subscript @xmath29 denotes the type of fluctuation , see table  [ tab : correlations ] .",
    "the correlation exponents @xmath30 can be derived from the elements of the dressed charge matrix , while the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constrained by the parity of the quantum numbers of the intermediate states  @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlations ] ) only gives the leading term of the asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions . in principle",
    "there are also higher harmonics present .",
    "however , their correlation exponents being larger , one can safely neglect these contributions if one is interested in the asymptotic behavior .",
    "our numerical results presented in the next section show that the dominant fflo mode occurs at the expected single momentum @xmath1 .",
    "a numerical solution of the bethe - ansatz equations for the hubbard model yields the elements of the dressed charge matrix , which allow one to sketch the the evolution of the correlation exponents with density and polarization  @xcite .",
    "our results for the dominant two - particle correlators obtained in the strong - coupling limit @xmath33 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents](a )",
    ". first , for @xmath34 , we plot the values of @xmath35 for three different densities ( filled symbols ) . in this limit",
    ", the cdw correlation exponent is given by @xmath36 .",
    "second , for @xmath37 it has been predicted by yang  @xcite that the fflo @xmath38 exponent is given by the ss exponent at @xmath34 plus 1/2 ( open symbols ) .",
    "our data confirm this result , see also ref .  .",
    "then , upon increasing the population imbalance , this correlation exponent decreases monotonically until it reaches unity as @xmath39 . the leading contribution to the asymptotic behavior of the cdw correlations",
    "is found for wave vectors @xmath40 , but their correlation exponent is always sizably larger than the fflo exponent and increases towards @xmath41 as @xmath39 .",
    "note that even in the limit @xmath42 the density correlation exponents at @xmath40 and @xmath43 do not become equal , signaling the absence of spin - charge separation at all @xmath21 in the general case @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "although longitudinal sdw and ts correlations also decay as power laws , they are not shown here because they decay more rapidly ( with exponents @xmath45 ) .",
    "these results clearly show that fflo pairing is the dominant two - particle correlation for any nonzero polarization ; hence , there is no chandrasekhar - clogston limit  @xcite beyond which the pairing breaks down in this strictly 1d model .",
    "while the above analysis of the two - particle correlation exponents shows that pairing fluctuations dominate , the 1d character of the system prevents the formation of a truly long - range - ordered ss phase . in higher dimensions , the restriction to power - law decay",
    "is lifted and one expects that by coupling an infinite number of chains with a suitable interchain interaction , a long - range ordered fflo phase can be stabilized . following the standard analysis of the dimensional crossover , see , e.g. , ref .  , we compare the dominant two - particle correlations with the green s functions and argue that upon lowering the temperature of the system , one either enters a phase dominated by the physics of 1d , if the two - particle correlations decay more slowly than the green s function , or , one flows first to a higher dimensional fermi liquid if the opposite condition is satisfied .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents](b ) , we plot the dependence of the ss and the two green s function correlation exponents on the polarization @xmath13 for different fillings @xmath23 in the strong - coupling limit @xmath33 . in the unpolarized system",
    ", the green s function decays exponentially because of the spin gap . in the polarized regime ,",
    "the exponent of the majority particles is smaller than the minority one , but both tend to @xmath46 in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig : exponents](c ) shows the phase diagram obtained by comparison of the single- and two - particle correlation exponents as a function of density and polarization for various interactions @xmath16 .",
    "here we go beyond ref .  , which neglected the fact that spin and charge are coupled immediately for all @xmath21 sufficiently away from half filling @xmath48 .",
    "because of the difference between the majority and minority exponents , the phase boundary between the fflo and the fermi liquid regime is smeared out , i.e. , there are two boundaries determined by @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for simplicity ,",
    "the two boundaries are only shown for the strong - coupling limit , while for finite @xmath16 , only the crossover with the majority particles ( @xmath49 ) is indicated . in dilute systems ,",
    "fflo pairing is observed for all polarizations , while at higher fillings , the superfluid phase is only established in situations with strong population imbalance .",
    "this leads to two disconnected patches of fflo ordering for interactions @xmath51 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents](c ) . for instance , for @xmath52 , the fflo phase is realized in the region @xmath53 , but there is also a small reentrant patch in the vicinity of the fully polarized half - filled system at @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that this simple comparison of the correlation exponents does not take into account residual interactions that might destabilize the fermi liquid phase at low temperatures and neglects the precise nature of the interchain couplings . for a parallel discussion of the dimensional crossover",
    ", we refer the reader to a very recent work by zhao and liu  @xcite , in which a similar phase diagram has been presented .",
    "recently , altman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested using spatial noise correlations as a universal probe of fluctuations in cold atomic gases . in experiments",
    ", these correlations can be extracted from a statistical analysis of many time - of - flight images of the expanding cloud of atoms , once they have been released from the trap . a key ingredient of the method is the fact that the spatial density distribution of the expanding cloud becomes proportional to the momentum distribution in the interacting system after the trap is released . for the lattice model",
    "we consider in this work , spatial noise correlations are defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the occupation number operator in momentum space .",
    "we will also refer to the total noise correlation @xmath58      we now proceed to a quantitative numerical evaluation of the noise correlations in the attractive hubbard model with strong interaction @xmath59 , at filling @xmath60 for different polarizations @xmath13 , using a coordinate - space - based dmrg algorithm with open boundary conditions  @xcite . for an in - depth discussion of the method and the noise correlations of various phases of extended hubbard models with balanced spin populations , we refer the reader to ref .  .",
    "to determine the noise correlations of a system with @xmath61 sites , one has to calculate @xmath62 four - point correlators .",
    "this number could be reduced by exploiting symmetries ; however , we choose not to do so , to get unbiased results for the sum rules  @xcite , which we use to check convergence . while a system with 64 sites seems rather small for dmrg calculations ,",
    "these sizes are , however , sufficient for the purpose of the present work .",
    "the main features of the noise correlations are already well established in these systems and finite - size scalings do not show any ambiguities . for such moderate system sizes , keeping up to 400 states results in a discarded weight smaller than @xmath63 .",
    "let us start the analysis with the unpolarized system , whose shot noise is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise][row ( a ) ] . in this case , fermions tend to pair in on - site singlets , leading to a gap in the spin sector and thus exponentially decaying sdw and ts correlations .",
    "since the correlation exponents @xmath64 , the ss correlations are dominant over the cdw correlations .",
    "this can be seen in the shot noise .",
    "quite generally , particle - hole fluctuations appear as negative signals along @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the ordering wave vector , while particle - particle correlations give a positive contribution along @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the dominant positive signal of the total shot noise g around @xmath68 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise](a , i ) , thus clearly indicates that ss correlations dominate over cdw fluctuations .",
    "as soon as the system is polarized , one recognizes two important modifications of the noise correlations with respect to the unpolarized case , see figs .",
    "[ fig : noise][rows ( b ) to ( f ) ] .",
    "most noticeably , the distinct comb present in the @xmath69-channel splits into two ridges peaked at @xmath70 , which move away from the anti - diagonal with increasing imbalance .",
    "the splitting @xmath71 between them directly corresponds to the momentum of the cooper pairs .",
    "_ this is the fingerprint of the fflo state . _",
    "the abrupt change from a comb with roughly constant height to pronounced peaks is due to the sudden increase of the correlation exponent upon entering the polarized phase .     in an unpolarized system with @xmath61 sites at filling @xmath60 for different interactions @xmath16 .",
    "the fermi surfaces ( nine - tile pattern ) , visible for small interactions , become weaker and finally disappear for strong couplings .",
    "ss correlations develop around opposite fermi points and start to spread out along the whole anti - diagonal with increasing attraction . _ [ fig : variableu],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in the same spirit , we note that the peaks become more pronounced for increasing @xmath13 , in agreement with the fact that the fflo exponent decreases with increasing @xmath13 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents](a ) .",
    "secondly , traces of the fermi surface , which are completely absent in the unpolarized system due to the presence of a spin gap , appear in all parts of the noise correlations as a nine - tile pattern best visible in figs .  [",
    "fig : noise][column ( ii ) ] .",
    "these fermi surfaces are characteristic of a system with gapless excitations  @xcite . based on the fact that particle - hole correlations give rise to a negative signal in the noise correlations",
    "while particle - particle contributions are positive , we expect four of the nine tiles to have negative values .",
    "this is in agreement with our numerical results . a density plot , along with plots of slices along the diagonal of @xmath72 , allows one to study the fflo phase in more detail .",
    "first , as derived before , the peaks of the ss signal in the @xmath69-channel are located at @xmath73 and the comb extends along @xmath74 . in the finite - size scalings of the ss signals parallel to the anti - diagonal , see figs .  [",
    "fig : noise][column ( iii ) ] , one can see that the correlations are peaked at @xmath73 and drop down to a constant positive background rather quickly away from this point .",
    "this phenomenon reflects the fact that the pairing of particles is stronger the closer the two momenta are to the corresponding fermi vectors .",
    "going along the direction of one of the arrows in the density plots , see figs .",
    "[ fig : noise][column ( ii ) ] , one encounters a first peak representing the pairing of down particles at momentum @xmath75 with up particles at momentum @xmath76 .",
    "continuing along this line , the @xmath77 momentum crosses the horizontal axis and approaches the fermi point @xmath78 .",
    "although pairing in this region is kinematically possible , it is clear that down particles around @xmath79 are preferably matched with up particles from the other side of the brillouin zone at @xmath80 .",
    "this illustrates the fact that the pairing correlations are closer to a larkin - ovchinnikov  @xcite type involving both @xmath81 pairs than a fulde - ferrell  @xcite type with a single @xmath1 .",
    "concerning experiments , it is encouraging to see that state - selective measurements of the shot noise , i.e. , separate measurements of the different @xmath82 are not necessary in order to identify the fflo phase , since at least in the highly polarized regime , the superfluid features present in the total shot noise @xmath83 are well separated and almost as pronounced as the main signal along the diagonal , see figs .",
    "[ fig : noise][bottom of column ( i ) ] .",
    "the occupation number @xmath84 for the two species separately as well as their sum is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : noise][column ( iv ) ] . the main characteristics for all nonzero polarizations",
    "is the sharp transition from empty to occupied orbitals and vice - versa at momenta @xmath85 , similar to the abrupt change observed in the momentum distribution of a metallic tomonaga - luttinger liquid , see fig .",
    "6(d ) in ref .  .",
    "in contrast , in the spin - gapped phase at zero polarization , the fermi points are invisible .",
    "we note that these density profiles do not contain direct evidence for the presence of dominant fflo correlations , since , for example , the population - imbalanced repulsive hubbard chain would show a very similar @xmath84 without having dominant fflo correlations .",
    "so far , we have focused on the strong - coupling regime , taking @xmath59 .",
    "reducing the attractive interaction allows one to study the influence of the correlation exponent on the shot noise .",
    "[ fig : variableu ] shows the off - diagonal correlator @xmath72 of the unpolarized system for interactions @xmath86 and @xmath87 at filling @xmath60 . according to ref .",
    ", these values of the interaction approximately correspond to luttinger exponents @xmath88 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , and 1.4 .",
    "note that ss correlations decay with a power - law exponent @xmath89 . for small @xmath16 , the two peaks are very narrow and strongly confined to the area surrounding opposite fermi points . with increasing @xmath16 , the interaction can scatter particles from well below the fermi surface , which leads to the spreading out of the base of the peaks . for strong interactions ,",
    "the fermi points are barely recognizable , the ridge extending almost uniformly along the whole anti - diagonal .",
    "it is thus the width of a peak or dip rather than its height that allows one to make a statement about the strength of the interaction and thus the correlation exponents . noting that widths and magnitudes are related by a sum rule that ensures vanishing volume under the shot noise  @xcite ; it is clear that with increasing width , the height of the peaks must decrease , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : variableu ] .      in experiments ,",
    "the atomic cloud is confined in a harmonic trap of the form @xmath90 with a trapping potential v. several groups  @xcite have recently analyzed the fflo pairing in 1d systems subject to a confining potential .",
    "compared to the homogeneous case , the fflo phase does not extend over the whole chain , but is confined to an interior part of the system : for small densities , an fflo state is formed in the center of the system , surrounded by fully polarized wings of unpaired majority particles  @xcite . in contrast , for denser fillings , i.e. , @xmath91 , the fully polarized wings remain , but the fflo phase is pushed away from the center of the trap and partly replaced by a polarized metallic phase of freely moving minority particles in a uniform background of majority fermions  @xcite . in order to detect an fflo signal in the noise correlations under realistic experimental conditions ,",
    "it is thus advantageous to work in the low - density region . to study the effects of a harmonic potential in this regime",
    ", we have calculated the local densities for systems with @xmath61 sites in the strong - coupling limit @xmath59 at filling @xmath92 and polarization @xmath93 for various depths of the trap , see figs .",
    "[ fig : trap][row ( a ) ] . even for shallow confinement [ fig .",
    "[ fig : trap](ai ) ] , the polarized wings are already visible .",
    "it is clear that by pushing some of the majority particles away from the central region of the trap , one changes the density and the polarization in the fflo region .",
    "it is useful to introduce an effective density @xmath94 and polarization @xmath95 at the center of the trap , where the density of the minority spins is greater than some small arbitrary cutoff @xmath96 , by defining @xmath97 @xmath98 denoting the usual step function . as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : trap][row ( a ) ] , the effective density in the center of the trap increases with increasing confinement , while at the same time the effective polarization is reduced .",
    "the presence of fflo pairing correlations in the central region of the trap can be deduced from the characteristic signal present in the noise correlations @xmath72 shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : trap][row ( b ) ] .",
    "in fact , one can convince oneself that the separation between the two ridges corresponds very accurately to the momentum of the pairs in the middle of the trap @xmath99 . for a shallow trap ,",
    "the effect is only subtle , because an increase in density is accompanied by a reduction of the polarization .",
    "both the increased density as well as the reduced polarization are unfavorable to the visibility of the fflo signal in the noise correlations .",
    "first , the correlations decay faster than in the homogeneous system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents](a ) , and , second , because the signal is proportional to the number of paired particles , there is a further reduction of the fflo signal due to the smaller effective volume @xmath100 in which pairing correlations dominate . despite these adverse effects , the total shot noise shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : trap][row ( c ) ] clearly illustrates that , for moderate traps , the fflo signal is still detectable .",
    "to conclude , we have derived the correlation exponents of the 1d attractive hubbard model at finite spin polarizations and have shown that the fflo type pairing correlations are dominant for polarizations @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the spatial noise correlations ( density - density correlations in momentum space ) in view of experimental realizations with ultra - cold atoms .",
    "we have found that the 1d analog of the inhomogeneous fflo state leaves a distinct fingerprint in the shot noise .",
