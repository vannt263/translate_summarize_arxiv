    "an equilibrium magnetic moment in its lowest energy introduces a high incidence of the black hole luminosity into the inner face of the torus through a surrounding magnetosphere with slip / no - slip boundary conditions , and enables support to an open flux tube to infinity with slip / slip boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "a quadrupole buckling mode emits gravitational radiation at twice the frequency @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . it develops out of an internal flow of energy and angular momentum from the inner to the outer face of the torus , in which total energy and angular momentum of the wave remain zero .",
    "the emitted gravitational radiation is therefore not extracted from the kinetic energy in this pair of waves .",
    "this contrasts with radiation extracted from single waves of frequency @xmath71 by the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability .",
    "it may be noted that this is equivalent to a positive entropy condition @xmath72 in the first law of thermodynamics @xmath73 for a torus at temperature @xmath74 , upon radiation of waves with specific angular momentum @xmath75 to infinity .",
    "see also @xcite on the entropy condition in the sommerfeld radiation condition .",
    "we proceed with the effect of gravitational radiation - reaction forces as follows .",
    "the backreaction of gravitational radiation consists of dynamical self - interactions and radiation - reaction forces @xcite . for slow motion sources with weak internal gravity",

    "the harmonic time - dependence @xmath92 derives from the integral boundaries in ( [ eqn_i ] ) , and hence applies to all components of the moment of inertia tensor .",
    "the linearized radiation - reaction force derives from the fifth time - derivative , i.e. , @xmath93 in the stability analysis of the previous section , supplemented with the kinematic surface conditions @xmath94 on the inner and outer boundaries @xmath43 .",
    "explicitly , we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . a fiducial value @xmath98 obtains for for a torus mass @xmath99 and a radius @xmath100 .",

    "the luminosity in quadrupole gravitational radiation , @xmath102 , results from a mass inhomogeneity @xmath103 of a few permille @xcite .",

    "balance with energy input in the suspended accretion state , being on the order of the luminosity in gravitational radiation @xmath106 , leaves @xmath104 self - consistently to be on the order of @xmath107 of a few permille as well for canonical values @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the index @xmath62 is related to the pressure @xmath110 in the torus . for a three - dimensional density @xmath111 , the symmetric case in forementioned slender torus limit @xmath112 gives @xmath113 where @xmath1145mev denotes a typical temperature of the torus in suspended accretion .",

    "black hole - torus systems may form a class of transient sources with emissions in several channels , possibly in association with grbs . for long grbs",
    ", this suggests an event rate of about 1/yr within a distance of 100mpc in association with supernovae .",
    "continuous all - sky supernovae surveys may detect all or most nearby hypernovae .",
    "their coordinates provide a guide to searches for the proposed bursts of gravitational radiation , by ligo / virgo , bar ( e.g. @xcite ) or sphere detectors .",
    "this approach reduces the geometrical search space , and may be augmented by surveys for transient sources in other wave - lenghts , e.g. , in the radio @xcite .",
    "searches for gravitational waves may find enhanced positive detection probability associated with supernovae , as the sum of false positive @xmath124 and true positive detections @xmath125 , and in excess of @xmath124 away from supernova events . if all long grbs stem from hypernovae , we expect a local supernovae - to - hypernovae ratio of a few hundred .",
    "the excess @xmath125 becomes apparent for a signal - to - noise ratio better than two .",
    "alternatively , a priori selected hypernova candidates from the parent supernova sample , e.g. , by detection of late time radio afterglows , would give an apparent excess @xmath125 at lower signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "complemented with distance estimates to supernovae or hypernovae , this provides a test for kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "we may test for grbs from rotating black holes by comparing the durations of bursts of gravitational radiation with with the de - redshifted durations of long grbs .    *",
