    "however , their experimental signatures are poorly addressed in the literature . in this paper",
    "we consider the possible phenomenology of a particle that interacts with a lepton and a meson and can be referred to as leptomeson ( lm ) .",
    "since lms are colorless they can be lighter ( and more accessible for collider probes ) than the leptoquarks with their heavy color dressing .    at low energies the new heavy particles may reveal themselves in the tiny effects on the lepton intrinsic properties ( magnetic moment , charge radius , etc . ) .",
    "currently one of the tools most sensitive to the new physics is the precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( amm ) @xmath1 , which reveals a discrepancy with its theoretical prediction within the standard model ( sm )  @xcite . in the theories of compositeness",
    "the new contributions to the lepton amm can arise from the relativistic bound state description of leptons  @xcite . among the possible new heavy composites ,",
    "purely leptogluons may contribute to the lepton amm starting only from the two - loop level .",

    "leptomesons ( leptodiquarks ) may effectively provide a new one - loop ( two - loop ) contribution to the muon amm .",

    "many kinds of one - loop contributions to @xmath5 were classified  @xcite by the types of particles that propagate in the loop , which typically include light sm fermions ( leptons and light quarks ) and heavy vectors , scalars and fermions ( @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and new heavy particles ) .",
    "in addition , there is a possibility of very light [ with the masses of @xmath9  gev ] superweakly coupled new particles  @xcite propagating in the loop , which is hard to test in collider experiments .",
