    "we present here the result of a first test looking for energy deposition of neutrinos in matter , other than via weak interactions .",
    "this test consisted in exposing a high purity germanium crystal to the cern high energy @xmath0 beam .",
    "such a device offers an easy - to - use , high - sensitivity active medium well suited for an exploratory search . with the very intense neutrino fluxes available in a beam , it is possible to achieve a meaningful limit even if each neutrino deposits only a very small amount of energy .",
    "if detected , neutrino energy losses in matter would have important consequences in several astrophysical contexts .",
    "in particular , an energy loss of neutrinos in the interior of the sun could explain the various deficits observed in solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the new super - kamiokande measurement of the solar neutrino spectrum  @xcite excludes a relative energy loss greater than a few per cent for 10  @xmath2 neutrinos traversing 600000  @xmath3 of matter with an average density of 1  @xmath4 .",
    "the result discussed here reaches a limit lower by two orders of magnitude , when one assumes an energy deposition proportional to the initial neutrino energy .",
    "it is also relevant in the case of energy transfers in a supernova explosion .",
    "we used a high - purity germanium ( hpge ) coaxial diode from eurisys mesures@xcite with an effective volume of 140  @xmath5 cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "germanium is a semiconductor having an intrinsic band gap of 0.74  @xmath6 and a mean electron - hole pair creation work of 2.9  @xmath6 .",
    "this device gives the lowest energy threshold that can be obtained in an active target of sufficient mass without requiring heavy cryogenic environment .",
    "the detector was installed in the cern high - energy wide band neutrino beam on a platform between the chorus and nomad oscillation experiments , 800  @xmath7 away from the primary beryllium target .    the beam is essentially composed of @xmath0 of average energy 24  @xmath8 , with a 1% contamination of @xmath9 .",
    "it is produced in two spills of 6  @xmath10 duration extracted at the beginning and the end of the 2.2  @xmath11 so - called flat top of the sps accelerator .",
    "the machine cycle is repeated every 14.4  @xmath11 .",
    "synchronisation signals came from the nomad experiment , defining 4 gates ( we keep nomad s nomenclature ) :    -calib gate , @xmath12 before the first neutrino spill ,    -nu1 and nu2 gates , covering the neutrino spills ,    -mu gate , during the flat - top in between the neutrino spills .",
    "if the neutrino energy loss was caused by rare but individually detectable effects ( i.e. releasing more than a few @xmath13 per ` interaction ' ) , it would be impossible to disentangle them from ordinary background ( such as charged particles correlated with the neutrino beam or neutrinos weak interactions ) .",
    "thus , for this first test , we concentrated on hypothetical processes where neutrinos would each leave a tiny amount of energy , the neutrino flux resulting in a global increase of the leakage current during the @xmath14 accelerator extraction duration .",
    "as a consequence , the read - out was carried out by an infinite time constant charge - preamplifier , dc - coupled to the hpge diode . the output of the preamplifier was sampled and digitized by a sigma - delta adc . on each gate ,",
    "the sigma - delta loop was reset , and sampling points were accumulated during @xmath15 , constituting a ` row ' .",
    "this arrangement allowed to integrate the energy deposition during the spill , whilst keeping a sufficient resolution on impulsional energy deposition ( @xmath16 fwhm on the @xmath17 @xmath18 line ) , thus allowing rough spectrometric monitoring and identification of photon or charged particle interactions in the crystal .",
    "a p - type ge crystal was chosen , the peripheric li - doped zone giving some protection against alphas and low - energy beta and gamma radiations from natural radioactivity .",
    "this protection was enforced by a @xmath19 thick lead shield surrounding the detector .",
    "the whole set - up was supported by 4 pneumatic insulators .",
    "special care was taken to enforce electromagnetic compatibility ( emc ) .",
    "electron - hole pairs are produced when energy is deposited in the crystal , thus creating a current through the diode .",
    "the leakage current was measured to be @xmath20 after a 24-hour warm - up period .",
    "when an ionizing particle crosses the crystal , it gives a fast pulse of @xmath21 duration .",
    "typically , a minimum ionizing particle crossing the whole thickness of the diode ( 5  @xmath22 ) deposits 30  @xmath2 .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the expected signal behaves very differently : we are looking for a continuous current excess , building up during the neutrino spill and proportional to the neutrino flux ( see figure  [ rows ] ) .",
    "the first step in the analysis is to identify and reject rows contaminated by photons or charged particles in the crystal .",
    "the discriminating cut is set to @xmath23 over at least two sampling points .",
    "this results in rejecting 41% of the rows in the nu1 gate , 38% in the nu2 gate and 12% in the calib and mu gates .",
    "the time distribution of these rejected energy depositions inside the @xmath24 nu1 or nu2 gates clearly exhibits the neutrino pulse time structure ( figure  [ beamprof ] ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we performed a first test to search for a continuous energy loss of neutrinos in matter .",
    "this was done by exposing a high - sensitivity germanium crystal to the cern high - energy @xmath0 beam .",
    "it was found that a neutrino of type @xmath0 loses less than @xmath25@xmath6 per @xmath22 of germanium ( about @xmath1 of the normal de / dx characterizing a minimum ionizing particle ) .",
    "incidently , this would mean an energy loss of @xmath26 for @xmath0 traversing the whole diameter of the earth ; thus an anomalous energy loss of @xmath0 can not explain the deficit of upgoing neutrinos seen by the superkamiokande detector @xcite . for the sake of comparison , the energy loss due to weak interactions amounts to @xmath27 per @xmath22 of germanium for neutrinos of the energy considered here . if the loss is predominantly attributed to @xmath9 s ( which could be more probable for an interaction of electromagnetic origin ) , then the limit is @xmath28 per @xmath22 of germanium and per @xmath9 .",
    "this result applies to a continuous interaction having an energy quantum in the range 1 @xmath6 to 1 @xmath13 .    to improve the significance of this result",
    "we should carry out the search again in better experimental conditions ( improved mechanical stability , enlarged statistics ... ) .",
    "we are also planning to continue the search at a nuclear reactor where the neutrino flux is higher and the energies are more relevant for astrophysical considerations .",
    "finally , we should investigate the use of other devices ( bolometers , rf cavities , etc . ) in order to alleviate the limitation on the minimum interaction quantum , which is intrinsic to the present technique .",
    "we would like to thank p. repain and l. serot for their help in the realization of the experimental set - up .",
    "we thank the nomad collaboration for providing the necessary interfaces with the accelerator informations .",
