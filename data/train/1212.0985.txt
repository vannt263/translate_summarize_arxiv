    "nucleation is one of the possible ways , by means of which a phase transition can be initiated . according to the classical nucleation theory , it is assumed that nucleus ( cluster ) of a new phase becomes stable to grow in a ` mother phase ' , when its size reaches some critical value  the critical size @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , both related processes , nucleation and nuclei growth , belong to the initial stages of phase transition .",
    "the character of phase transition depends directly on the nucleation rate @xmath13 and the growth rate @xmath14 .",
    "appearance of liquid droplets ( bubbles ) as origins of condensation ( vaporization ) and emergence of crystallite grains at crystallization are the typical examples of nucleation .",
    "a feature of homogeneous nucleation for most of molecular systems at the natural conditions is that the characteristic spatial scale  @xcite , which is associated with the linear critical size of the nucleated phase , takes the values @xmath15 m .",
    "thereby , the processes of nucleation and of nuclei growth are excellent candidates to be studied by means of the methods of molecular dynamics simulation",
    ". however , the probabilistic character of nucleation ( the values of nucleation rate , critical size , growth rate and others ) prompts applying the statistical treatment of the simulation results .",
    "recently , it was shown that the mean - first - passage - time ( mfpt ) approach can be successfully used to define all the characteristics of nucleation kinetics from the data of molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite . in the idealized case of the symmetric nucleation barrier ,",
    "the mftp - distribution obtained from the set of independent simulations or from experiments is interpolated in the nucleation regime by the error - function , and such parameters as the steady - state nucleation rate @xmath13 ( or the nucleation time scale @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the system volume ) , the critical size @xmath12 and the curvature of the nucleation barrier associated with the zeldovich factor @xmath18 can be extracted by numerical fitting .",
    "an extended mftp approach allows one to define all these parameters for a wider class of nucleation scenario by numerical analysis of the first derivative of the mfpt - curve with respect to the reaction coordinate ( say , nucleus size ) . in the present work",
    "we show that the same mfpt - approach can be also applied to define the characteristics of the nuclei growth regime .",
    "we demonstrate this analysis as applied for the case of the water droplet growth .",

    "full circles correspond to the fit ( see text for details).,width=453 ]    the basic idea of the mfpt - approach is the next .",
    "first , it is necessary to focus on the reaction coordinate and to define the time scales of the first appearance of its values , @xmath30 . as a reaction coordinate for the case of the droplet nucleation , it is convenient to utilize the droplet size @xmath31 , which defines the number of molecules ( particles ) involved in the nucleus of new ( liquid ) phase .",
    "second , by defining these time scales from @xmath32 independent ` experiments ' and by averaging results , one obtains the mfpt - distribution : @xmath33    in fact , the mfpt - distribution contains the information about nucleation and nucleus growth kinetics . for example , the first inflection points in the mfpt - curve defines the critical size @xmath12 with the lag - time @xmath34 ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "then , the part of the inverted mfpt - distribution @xmath35 corresponds to the most probable growth law of the nucleated droplet .",
    "let us suppose the growth law in the following generalized form @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the shape - factor , @xmath38 is the density of the nucleated phase , @xmath39 is the growth exponent  it is equal to unity in the case of constant growth rate , @xmath40 is the growth parameter and @xmath41 is the system dimension . without losing the generality in such a definition , the growth rate can be time - dependent term and takes the next form : @xmath42 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by fitting equation  ( [ eq_growth_law_1 ] ) to the distribution @xmath35",

    "these results are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations within the mftp - approach .",
    "the mfpt - treatment of these results reveals the interesting features of the nucleation - growth kinetics .",
    "the critical size @xmath46 has a weak decay with the temperature ( for the considered temperature range and the fixed pressure ) , that contradicts the classical nucleation theory predictions  @xcite . on other hand , the lag - time @xmath29 increases with temperature from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the nucleated droplets have shapes , which are closed to spherical ones ( see figure  [ fig_snapshots of droplet ] ) .",
    "further , the growth parameter @xmath40 decreases with temperature from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , whilst the growth exponent is independent on the temperature and takes the value @xmath51 .",
    "this indicates on the next time dependence of the growth rate : @xmath52 .",
    "other result is that the growth curves rescaled to the form @xmath53 are independent on the temperature and collapse onto a single growth curve ( see figure  [ fig_rescaled_growth_curves ] ) .",
    "the following results are presented in this work .",
