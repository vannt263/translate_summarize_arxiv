    "while the lep experiments reach their final phases , the upgraded tevatron ( @xmath2tev ) at fnal and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( @xmath3tev ) will provide the next front in searches for particles associated with physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , since lep can not probe masses significantly above the @xmath4gev mark , the probe of heavier particles will remain the task of these two hadronic machines .",
    "sufficient production cross sections at these colliders , however , may be difficult to achieve if the new particles carry only weak charges .",
    "effective couplings of these particles to ( initial ) gluons may be induced at the quantum level , but they suffer from loop suppression and , hence , are generically small .",
    "sufficiently large and measurable production cross sections require either some enhancement of the radiative gluonic couplings or an alternative production mechanism .",
    "in the case of the higgs bosons present in supersymmetric models , as well as non - supersymmetric two - higgs - doublet models , there exist two potentially large parameters that can partially compensate for the otherwise small couplings : the intrinsically large @xmath5-quark yukawa coupling and the ratio of vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) of the two neutral higgs bosons @xmath6 , which is constrained from above to be @xmath7 by the perturbativity of yukawa couplings .",
    "they may @xmath8 enhance the radiatively induced gluonic coupling of the neutral higgs , in proportion to the @xmath5-quark yukawa coupling , leading to production via @xmath9  @xcite ; @xmath10 sufficiently increase the rate for the decay of the @xmath5-quark into a ( light ) charged higgs boson , @xmath11  @xcite ; or @xmath12 enhance the higgs - strahlung associate production through the @xmath13 partonic processes @xmath14  @xcite , through the @xmath15 ones @xmath16  @xcite , and through the @xmath17 process",

    "@xcite . )    from charge conservation , a radiatively induced gluonic coupling can not lead , at the level of an elementary process , to the production of only one charged higgs .",
    "hence , one needs to consider either the single production from @xmath5-quark decays or the production in association with quarks  which is referred to as higgs - strahlung .",
    "production in association with gauge bosons @xmath19/@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and in supersymmetric models , in association with squarks , is also possible .",
    "the former mechanism , however , leads to subleading cross sections , which are difficult to observe  @xcite .",
    "the latter  @xcite is more model - dependent and will not be considered here .",
    "the production mechanisms with one single higgs ( and quarks ) in the final state , or `` single production '' , are kinematically in advantage with respect to pair - production mechanisms .",
    "the latter includes @xmath22 the drell  yan process @xmath23 , which is suppressed by weak couplings , and , at the lhc , by the low quark luminosities ( relative to the gluon one ) ; @xmath24 effective gluonic couplings , which are now allowed by charge invariance , @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "pair production , therefore , does not allow the discovery of the charged higgs at the tevatron . at the lhc",
    ", it provides a limited discovery reach of the charged higgs in a non - supersymmetric two - higgs - doublet model  @xcite , but it may become more competitive in supersymmetry where additional contributions to the effective gluonic couplings arise  @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on the single production of a charged higgs boson .",
    "single production from @xmath5-quark decays plays the most important role when it is kinematically allowed , that is for @xmath26 , and was studied extensively by various authors  @xcite .",
    "the charged - higgs - strahlung in the @xmath13 channels @xmath27 encompasses the resonant production of a pair @xmath28 followed by the decay @xmath29 in the same kinematical region @xmath30 ; in addition , it provides the intrinsically off - shell associate production of @xmath31 beyond this kinematical limit , throughout all possible ranges of @xmath32 .",
    "strahlung from the @xmath33 channel @xmath34 is also possible , since the @xmath35-quark is obtained from the proton via a gluon .",
    "therefore , both types of partonic processes , the @xmath36 and the @xmath37 , give rise to inclusive processes that are formally of the same order in an @xmath38 expansion . note that away from the resonance region , @xmath39 decays dominantly into @xmath40 , and the @xmath5-quark into @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 processes @xmath27 give rise to four @xmath35-quarks in the final state , whereas only three @xmath35 s are produced in the @xmath42 process @xmath34 .",
    "both elementary processes contribute to the inclusive production of a single charged higgs at hadron colliders , when at most three @xmath35-quarks are tagged and used to identify the final particle configuration .",
    "if four @xmath35 s can be detected , it is possible to measure each cross section separately .",
    "otherwise , the two elementary processes have to be properly combined into an inclusive cross section , avoiding double counting of the contributions coming from @xmath34 and from @xmath43 , when one of the two gluons produces a @xmath44 pair collinear to the initial proton ( or antiproton ) . since",
    "identification and detection issues will not be discussed here , both the individual - channel and inclusive cross sections will be given below .",
    "the charged - higgs production cross sections are calculated and illustrated for the upgraded tevatron and the lhc in section  [ sec : s2 ] , where all relevant issues are discussed in detail .",
    "attention is given to the prospects of discovery at the tevatron , which may constrain @xmath32 beyond the kinematical limit @xmath45 .",
    "on the lhc front , it is found that a charged higgs as heavy as @xmath1(tev ) may be produced at the lhc via the strahlung processes .",
    "the results shown are valid for the charged higgs of supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "the charged - higgs decay modes , however , may differ in the two classes of models if @xmath32 is sufficiently large  @xcite .    for reference ,",
    "the indirect lower limit on @xmath32 coming from the measurement of the inclusive decay @xmath46 amounts ( at present ) only to @xmath47gev  @xcite in non - supersymmetric two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "no substantial limit exists for charged higgs in supersymmetric models , when supersymmetric partners can be exchanged in the loop mediating the @xmath48 decay . direct lower bounds on @xmath49 are given by collider searches at lep ii and at the tevatron .",
    "the lep ii bound , @xmath50gev  @xcite at @xmath51gev ( @xmath52gev at higher energy runs  @xcite ) , applies to the case of a charged higgs boson present in two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "the tevatron searches give combined ( and currently modest ) bounds in the @xmath49@xmath53 plane for supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric charged higgs bosons .",
    "both searches have been critically discussed in ref .",
    "conservatively , all results presented in this paper are shown for @xmath54gev , the model - independent limit extracted from the measurement of the @xmath55 width .    in supersymmetric models in which @xmath0-parity and lepton number are not conserved , the hypercharge @xmath56 higgs and slepton fields are not distinguished by any quantum numbers and could interact in a similar way .",
    "thus , in these models , sleptons can be produced via slepton - strahlung just as the ( charged ) higgs .",
    "the relevant yukawa couplings , i.e. the slepton  fermion ",
    "fermion couplings , are subject to various low - energy constraints but are otherwise arbitrary , since they do not relate to fermion masses ( once the two higgs doublets are identified as those whose neutral components are aligned along the two large vev s ) .",
    "they are , however , related to radiative neutrino masses , as explained below , and therefore measurements of lepton - number - violating operators from slepton production provide a unique and important window on this class of models for neutrino masses .",
    "the associate production cross section for the charged sleptons is presented for both the tevatron and the lhc experiments in section  [ sec : s3 ] .",
    "it is shown that charged sleptons can be produced in abundance for @xmath0-parity - violating couplings as small as @xmath57 .",
    "relations and possible lessons to models of neutrino masses are also demonstrated in section  [ sec : s3 ] .",
    "we also comment on the case of the neutral sleptons , the sneutrinos @xmath58 , which is complicated by the presence of the gluon fusion channel @xmath59 .",
    "results and discussions of the potential impact of these strahlung channels on future searches are summarized in section  [ sec : s4 ] , where we also comment on the possibility that both charged - higgs and slepton - strahlung channels are present .",

    "hence , our results can be generalized in a straightforward fashion to the production of other charged sleptons in association with @xmath5- and @xmath35-quarks .",

    "it is interesting to note that if the coupling is large enough to lead to slepton production , it is probable that the corresponding neutrino can not be in the sub - ev range , as is sometimes assumed , unless the @xmath240-squarks are in the multi - tev range , and with negligible left  right mixing .",
    "furthermore , a large slepton production cross section , may even imply a heavy neutrino species , which decays on cosmological time scales .",
    "alternatively , if the @xmath240-squarks are not discovered at the lhc ( when considering the @xmath0-parity - violating cascades ) , the same range of coupling would automatically imply much lighter neutrinos , possibly in the sub - ev range , enhancing the coverage of the neutrino - mass parameter space .",
    "thus , collider studies in this case carry indirect but crucial implications to models of neutrino masses and can help reveal the neutrino spectrum .",
    "this beneficial relation is due to supersymmetry , which relates the neutrino radiative mass operators and the slepton ",

    "the gluon - fusion cross section also depends quadratically on @xmath188 yukawa couplings , and it is given by a straightforward generalization of the higgs gluon - fusion @xmath9 cross section  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have shown that charged higgs- and slepton - strahlung provide important channels of single production .",
    "our study implies a significant production cross section , in particular at the lhc , but also at the upgraded tevatron energies .",
    "for example , charged higgs bosons and staus as heavy as @xmath254tev can be produced at the lhc ( figs .",
    "[ lhcmassdep ] and  [ lhcrviol ] ) . for lighter staus ,",
    "@xmath0-parity - violating couplings as small as 0.01 may be probed ( fig .",

    "[ tevsum ] and  [ tevrviol ] ) , the kinematic reach may be significantly extended with respect to that obtained from the @xmath5-quark decays @xmath255 and @xmath225 .",
    "of course , more conclusive statements should await detailed background and detection studies .",
    "our calculations , at the leading order , include exact evaluation of the three - body phase space , and special attention was given to the correct summation of the various contributions to the inclusive cross section .",
    "the importance of @xmath35-tagging in separating the various channels was pointed out .",
    "in addition , various weakly interacting particles may be produced simultaneously in association with quarks ( e.g. the charged higgs and one or two charged sleptons ) , hence raising the issue of their separation and identification . in particular , in the case of the stau studied here , the slepton signature could be similar to that of the charged higgs .",
    "( similarly , the neutral higgs and sneutrino could both be produced via gluon fusion and/or strahlung and could also decay similarly , extending the problem to the neutral sector as well . )",
    "one may have to rely on mass differences and on more suppressed @xmath177-violating or supersymmetric decays in order to distinguish the different bosons .",
    "detection of singly produced sleptons via the strahlung process ( or any other process ) carries substantial benefits to the mapping of the lepton - number - violating potential ( and superpotential ) .",
    "hence , it also carries important consequences to models in which neutrino masses are obtained radiatively , since radiative neutrino masses are proportional to the couplings of the slepton ",
    "quark yukawa operators . leaving detection issues aside",
    ", heavy sleptons could be abundantly produced in @xmath177-violating models and small @xmath177-violating couplings ( and hence , small neutrino masses ) may be probed .",
    "though not discussed explicitly , a similar situation to the one studied in this paper can arise in any other model in which a weakly interacting scalar couples via a non - negligible yukawa coupling to quarks .",
