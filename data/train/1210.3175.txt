    "spontaneous synchronization of coupled non - identical oscillators is a well - known form of collective behavior@xcite .",
    "the problem has been intensively studied since huygens .",
    "if the legend is true , presumably he was the first one who noticed and reported the synchronized swinging of pendulum clocks . by simple experiments he found that the synchronized state is a stable limit cycle of the system , because even after perturbing the system , the pendulums came back to this dynamic state .",
    "originally , huygens thought that this _",
    "`` odd kind of sympathy '' _ , as he named it , occurs due to shared air currents between the pendulums .",
    "he performed several tests to confirm this idea .",
    "his experimental setup was really simple , with two pendulum clocks hung from a common suspension beam which was placed between two chairs @xcite .",
    "after performing some additional tests , huygens observed a stable and reproducible anti - phase synchronization , and attributed this to imperceptible vibrations in the suspension beam .",
    "he summarized his observations in a letter to the royal society of london @xcite , and launched the study of synchronization phenomena and coupled oscillators .",
    "recent studies have aimed at reconsidering various forms of huygens two pedulum - clock experiment as well as realistically modelling the system .",
    "bennet and his group @xcite investigated the same two pendulum - clock system as huygens did and came to the conclusion that several types of collective dynamics are observable as a function of the system s parameters . for strong coupling ,",
    "a `` beat death '' phenomenon usually occurs where one pendulum oscillates and the other does not . for weak coupling",
    ", synchronization does not occur , and a quasi - periodic oscillation is observed .",
    "there is , however , an intermediate coupling strength interval where the anti - phase synchronization observed by huygens appears .",
    "hence , huygens had some luck with his setup as the coupling was just in the right interval : strong enough to cause synchronization , but also weak enough to avoid the `` beat death '' phenomenon .",
    "dilao @xcite came to the conclusion that the periods of two synchronized nonlinear oscillators ( pendulum clocks ) differ from the natural frequencies of the oscillators .",
    "kumon and his group @xcite have studied a similar system consisting of two pendulums , one of them having an excitation mechanism , and the two pendulums being coupled by a weak spring .",
    "fradkov and andrievsky @xcite developed a model for such a system , and obtained from numerical solutions that both in- and anti - phase synchronizations are possible , depending on the initial conditions .",
    "kapitaniak and his group @xcite revisited huygens original experiment and found that the anti - phase synchronization usually emerges , although in rare cases in - phase synchronization is also possible .",
    "they also developed a more realistic model for this experiment @xcite .",
    "pantaleone @xcite considered a similar system , but he used metronomes placed on a freely moving base ( suspended on two cylinders ) instead of pendulum clocks .",
    "he modeled the metronomes as van der pol oscillators @xcite and came to the conclusion that anti - phase synchronization occurs in some rare cases only .",
    "he proposed this setup as an easy classroom demonstration for the kuramoto model @xcite and extended the study for larger systems containing up to seven globally coupled metronomes .",
    "he also made quantitative investigations by tracking the motion of the metronomes pendulum by acoustically registering the ticks with a microphone .",
    "ulrichs and his group @xcite examined the case when the number of metronomes was even larger .",
    "the present state of this quite old field of physics was recently reviewed by kapitaniak et .",
    "al @xcite .",
    "our work is intended to continue this line of studies showing that it is still possible to find interesting aspects of this quite old problem in physics .",
    "in contrast to previous works , we consider an ensemble of metronomes arranged symmetrically on the perimeter of a freely rotating disk , as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the free rotation of the disk acts as a coupling mechanism between the metronomes and , for high enough ticking frequencies , synchronization emerges .",
    "our aim here is to investigate the conditions favoring such spontaneous synchronization by using a realistic model and model parameters . in order to achieve our task",
    ", we first study the dynamics of the system by well - controlled experiments . contrary to earlier studies that investigated only the final stable dynamic state of the system ,",
    "here we also consider and describe the transient dynamics leading to synchronization .",
    "the synchronization level is quantified and measured .",
    "this is achieved by using an optical phase - detection mechanism for each metronome separately .",
    "we then construct a realistic model for the system and its modeling power is proved by comparing its results with the experimental ones .",
    "we discuss the reasons behind the fact that only in - phase synchronization is observed in our experiments .",
    "finally , the model is used to investigate the emergence of synchronization in large ensembles of coupled metronomes .",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the main units are the metronomes ( figure [ fig1 ] and [ fig3]a ) , which are devices that produce regular , metrical beats .",
    "they were patented by johann maelzel in 1815 as a timekeeping tool for musicians ( @xcite ) .",
    "the oscillating element of the metronome is a physical pendulum , which consists of a rod with two weights on it ( figure [ fig2 ] ) : a fixed one at the lower end of the rod , whose mass is denoted by w1 , and a movable one , @xmath0 , attached to the upper part of the rod . in general , @xmath1 and the rod is suspended on a horizontal axis between the two weights in a stable manner , so that the center of mass lies below the suspension axes .    by sliding the @xmath0 weight along the rod , the oscillation frequency can be tuned .",
    "there are several marked places on the rod where the @xmath0 weight has a stable position , yielding standard ticking frequencies for the metronome .",
    "these @xmath2 frequencies are marked on the metronome in units of beats per minute ( bpm ) .",
    "another key part of the metronomes is the excitation mechanism , which compensates for the energy lost to friction .",
    "this mechanism gives additional momentum to the physical pendulum in the form of pulses delivered at a given phase of the oscillation period . for a more detailed analysis of this excitation mechanism",
    "we recommend the work of kapitaniak _ et .",
    "@xcite    for the experiments , we used the commercially available thomann 330 metronomes ( figure [ fig3]a ) . from the 10 metronomes we had bought ,",
    "the 7 with the most similar frequencies were selected .",
    "naturally , since there are no two identical units , we have to deal with a non - zero standard deviation of the natural frequencies in experiments    in order to globally couple the metronomes , we placed them on a disk shaped platform which could rotate with a very little friction around a vertical axis , as is sketched in figure [ fig1 ] and illustrated in the photo in figure [ fig3]a .",
    "in order to monitor the dynamics of all metronomes separately , photo - cell detectors ( figure [ fig3]b ) were mounted on them .",
    "these detectors were commercial ones ( kingbright ktir 0611 s ) , and contained a light emitting diode and a photo - transistor .",
    "they were mounted on the bottom of the metronomes .",
    "the wires starting from each metronome ( seen in figure [ fig3 ] ) connect the photo - cells with a circuit board , allowing data collection through the usb port of a computer .",
    "the data was collected using a free , open - source program , called _",
    "minicom_. ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data was saved in log files , and could be processed in real - time .",
    "it was possible to simultaneously follow the states of up to @xmath3 metronomes .",
    "the circuit board only sent data when there was a change in the signal from the photo - cell system ( i.e. a metronome s bob passed the light - gate ) . at that point",
    ", it would record a string such as @xmath4 @xmath5 , where the first @xmath6 numbers characterize the metronome bob s position relative to the photo - cell ( whether the gate is open or closed ) and the eighth number is the time , where one time unit corresponds to 64 microseconds .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamics of this system from the perspective of synchronization , we computed the classical order parameter , r , of the kuramoto model @xcite in our numerical evaluations : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the average phase of the whole ensemble , @xmath9 is the phase of the @xmath10-th metronome , @xmath11 is the number of metronomes , and @xmath12 is the imaginary unit .",
    "the recorded data only tells us the exact moment at which the metronome s bob passes through the light - gate , so some additional steps are needed in order to get the phases @xmath9 of all metronomes and to compute the kuramoto order - parameter for a given moment in time . in order to achieve this , we first excluded from the data those time - moments when the metronome s bob passed through the light - gate for the second time in a period , and after that we retained the pass - times corresponding to a given directional motion only . with this `` cleaned data '' , we calculated the period of each cycle and interpolated this time - interval for the @xmath9 phases ( between @xmath13 and @xmath14 , corresponding to the state of a kuramoto rotator ) assuming a uniform angular - velocity .",
    "this way , the phase @xmath9 of each metronome ( considered here as a rotator ) could be uniquely determined at each moment in time , and the kuramoto order parameter ( [ op ] ) could be computed .    before starting the experiments we monitored each metronome separately and recorded their exact frequency , @xmath15 , for all the standardly marked rhythms .",
    "these frequencies had a small , but finite fluctuation around the nominal frequency , @xmath2 .",
    "we have selected those @xmath6 metronomes that had their @xmath15 standard frequencies relatively close to each other , and precisely measured these values . from these values",
    "the standard deviation , @xmath16 , of the used metronomes natural frequencies could be determined ( table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "as already described in the introductory section , the met- metronomes oscillate with different natural frequencies , depending on the position of the adjustable weight on the metronomes rod . for our experiments",
    "we have used the standard frequencies marked on the metronome .",
    "these frequencies are given in @xmath17 units .    before discussing the experimental results in detail",
    ", we have to emphasize that , independently of the chosen initial condition , only in - phase synchronization of the metronomes was observed .",
    "the reasons for this will be given in a separate section ( section [ sync ] ) .",
    "in the very first experiments we were studying how the chosen frequency influences the detected synchronization level .",
    "we fixed all the metronomes frequencies on the same marked @xmath2 value and placed them symmetrically on the perimeter of the rotating platform as indicated in figure [ fig3]a .",
    "in reality , of course , this does not mean that their frequencies were exactly the same since no two macroscopic physical systems can be exactly identical .",
    "we initialized the system by starting the metronomes randomly , and let the system composed of the metronomes and platform evolve freely .    for each considered frequency value we made @xmath18 measurements , collecting data for 10 minutes .",
    "the dynamics of the computed kuramoto order parameter averaged across the 10 independent experiments are presented in figure [ fig5]a .",
    "the results suggest that the obtained degree of synchronization increases as the metronomes natural frequencies increase .",
    "the standard deviations of the natural frequencies of the independent oscillators are indicated in table [ table2 ] .",
    ".standard deviation of the seven metronomes used for different nominal frequencies .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "inspired by the model described in @xcite , it is possible to consider a simple mechanical model for the system investigated here .",
    "the model is composed of a rotating platform and physical pendulums attached to its perimeter , as is sketched in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the lagrange function of such a system is written as : @xmath19 ^ 2 + \\\\   & & + \\big[\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(h_i \\cos \\theta_i\\big)\\big]^2\\big\\ } - \\sum_{i=1}^n m_i g h_i(1-\\cos\\theta_i )   \\label{lagrange }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term is the kinetic energy of the platform , the second is the kinetic energy due to the rotation of the pendulum around its center of mass , the third one is the kinetic energy of the pendulum s center of mass , and the last term is the potential energy of the pendulum . in the lagrangian we have used the following notations : the index @xmath12 denotes the pendulums , @xmath20 is the moment of inertia of the platform with the metronomes on it  taken relative to the vertical rotation axes , @xmath8 is the angular displacement of the platform , @xmath21 is the total mass of the pendulum ( @xmath22 , neglecting the mass of the rod ) , @xmath23 is the distance between the center of mass and the suspension point of the pendulum , @xmath24 is the horizontal displacement of the center of mass of the pendulums due to the rotation of the platform , @xmath25 is the displacement of the @xmath12-th pendulum s center of mass , in radians , @xmath26 is the moment of inertia of the pendulum relative to its center of mass and @xmath15 is the angular velocity of the rotation of the pendulum relative to its center of mass .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "assuming now that the mass of all the weights suspended on the metronomes bobs are the same ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and consequently @xmath31 ) , and disregarding the @xmath32 constant terms , one obtains : @xmath33 the euler - lagrange equations of motion yield : @xmath34 = 0   \\label{eqm - ndf1 } \\\\\\ ] ] @xmath35 \\ddot \\theta_i + mr \\ddot \\phi   h_i \\cos \\theta_i+mgh_i \\sin\\theta_i = 0 .",
    "\\label{eqm - ndf2}\\ ] ]    the above equations of motion are for a hamiltonian system where there is no damping ( no friction ) and no driving ( excitation ) .",
    "friction and excitation from the metronomes driving mechanism has to be taken into account with some extra terms . the system of equations of motion may be written as @xmath36 + \\\\ & &   + c_{\\phi } \\dot \\phi + \\sum_i \\mathbb{m}_i= 0    \\label{metron2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath37\\ddot \\theta_i & + & mr\\ddot \\phi   h_i \\cos \\theta_i+\\\\ & & + mgh_i \\sin\\theta_i + c_{\\theta } \\dot \\theta_i= \\mathbb{m}_i . \\label{metron2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are coefficients characterizing the friction in the rotation of the platform and pendulums , and @xmath40 are some instantaneous excitation terms defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the dirac function and @xmath43 is a fixed parameter characterizing the driving mechanism of the metronomes .",
    "the choice of the form for @xmath40 in equation ( [ excitation ] ) means that excitations are given only when the metronome s bob passes the @xmath44 position .",
    "the term @xmath45 is needed in order to ensure a constant momentum input , independently of the metronomes amplitude .",
    "it also ensures that the excitation is given in the correct direction ( the direction of motion ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the total momentum transferred , @xmath46 , to the metronomes in a half period ( @xmath47 ) is always @xmath43 : @xmath48 this driving will be implemented in the numerical solution as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time - step in the numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "clearly , this driving leads to the same total momentum transfer @xmath43 as the one defined by equation ( [ excitation ] ) .",
    "the coupled system of equations ( [ metron2a],[metron2 ] ) can be written in a form more suitable for numerical integration :    @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath53 now taking into account that the metronomes bobs have the form sketched in figure [ fig2]b and the @xmath54 distances are fixed and assumed to be identical for all the metronomes , the @xmath23 and @xmath26 terms of the physical pendulums in our model will be calculated as :    @xmath55",
    "the parameters were chosen following the experimental device : @xmath56 @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath57 , @xmath59 @xmath60 , @xmath61m$ ] depending on the chosen natural frequency , @xmath62 @xmath60 and @xmath63kg~m^2 $ ] depending on the number of metronomes placed on the platform .",
    "the damping and excitation coefficients were estimated as follows . for the estimation of @xmath39 ,",
    "a single metronome on a rigid support was considered .",
    "switching off the excitation mechanism , a quasi - harmonic damped oscillation of the metronome took place .",
    "the exponential decay of its amplitude as a function of time uniquely defines the damping coefficient , hence a simple fit of the amplitude as a function of time allowed the determination of @xmath39 . switching the excitation mechanism on lead to a steady - state oscillation regime with constant amplitude .",
    "since @xmath39 has already been measured , this amplitude value is defined by the excitation coefficient @xmath43 . solving equations",
    "( [ metron2a ] ) and ( [ metron2 ] ) for a single metronome and tuning it until the same steady - state amplitude is obtained as in experiments makes the estimation of @xmath43 possible .",
    "now that both @xmath39 and @xmath43 are known , the following scenario is considered : all the metronomes are placed on the platform and synchronization is reached .",
    "then the platform has a constant - amplitude oscillatory motion . in order to determine @xmath38 ,",
    "its value is tuned while solving equations ( [ metron2a])-([metron2 ] ) until the same amplitude of the disk s oscillations is obtained as in the experiments . this way , all the parameters in the model can be related to the experimental quantities .",
    "using the method defined above , we estimated the following parameter values : @xmath64 @xmath57 @xmath65 , @xmath66 @xmath57 @xmath65 and @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "as described in the introductory section , many previous works have reported a stable anti - synchronized state in the case of two coupled oscillators @xcite . due to the fact that no such stable phase was observed in our experiments ( independently of the starting conditions )",
    ", we feel that investigating this issue is important . starting from our theoretical model",
    "described in section [ theo ] , we will show that the in - phase synchronization is favored whenever there are large enough equilibrated damping and driving forces acting on the metronomes .",
    "first , let us investigate the case without any damping and with no driving forces .",
    "the equations of motion for such a system are given by equations ( [ eqm - ndf1 ] ) and ( [ eqm - ndf2 ] ) .",
    "considering the case of two identical metronomes ( @xmath69 ) with small - angle deviations ( @xmath70 ) , we investigate the synchronization properties of such a system . the synchronization level will be studied here by an appropriately chosen order parameter for two metronomes , @xmath71 , that indicates whether we have in - phase or anti - phase synchronization . although we could have used the kuramoto order parameter for this purpose",
    ", we decided to introduce a new , more suitable order parameter .",
    "note that this new order parameter is only useful for small ensembles , because its calculation would be very time consuming for large systems .",
    "in order to introduce a proper order parameter , let us consider the dynamics of two metronomes as a function of time by plotting @xmath72 ( figure [ fig - opn ] ) .",
    "let us denote the time - moments where metronome @xmath12 reaches a local minimum and maximum @xmath73 values by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "we denote the time - moments where metronome 2 has local maximum @xmath76 values by @xmath77 . with these notations , we define two time - like quantities that characterize the average time - interval of the maximum position of @xmath78 relative to the maximum and minimum positions of @xmath79 , respectively :    @xmath80    in the above equations the averages are considered over all @xmath10 maximum positions of @xmath78 , and the `` @xmath81 '' notation refers to the minimal value of the quantity in the brackets . now , the @xmath71 order parameter is defined as :    @xmath82    it is easy to see that @xmath71 is bounded between @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for totally in - phase synchronized dynamics we have @xmath85 , leading to @xmath86 . for totally anti - phase synchronized dynamics @xmath87 , and we get @xmath88 .",
    "negative @xmath71 values suggest a dynamic where the anti - phase synchronized states are dominant , positive @xmath71 values suggest a dynamic with more pronounced in - phase synchronized states .    the @xmath71 order parameter was estimated numerically for different initial conditions .",
    "a velocity verlet - type algorithm was used , and simulations were performed up to a @xmath89 @xmath90 time interval , with a @xmath91 @xmath90 time - step .",
    "initially the deviation angle of the first metronome was chosen as @xmath92 rad and @xmath93 was chosen in the interval @xmath94 $ ] rad , leading to various initial phase - differences between them .",
    "the computed @xmath71 values as a function of @xmath93 are plotted in figure [ q - op ] .",
    "the above results suggest that for the friction - free and undriven case ( figure [ q - op ] ) , synchronization and phase - locking of coupled identical metronomes are possible only if they start either in completely in - phase or completely anti - phase configurations .",
    "depending on how the phases are initialized , the ticking dynamics statistically resemble either the in - phase or the anti - phase states , but no phase - locking or synchronization is observable . starting from an arbitrary initial condition a complete in - phase or anti - phase synchronization is possible only if there is dissipation and driving . for small dissipation and driving values both the in - phase and anti - phase synchronization",
    "are possible , as the results obtained for @xmath95 nm / s suggests . in this limit in - phase synchronization will emerge if the initial phases are closer to such a situation .",
    "alternatively , if the initial conditions resemble the anti - phase configuration , a stable anti - phase synchronization emerges . for higher dissipation and driving values ( characteristic for our experimental setup , @xmath96 nm / s ) this",
    "apparently symmetric picture breaks down , and the in - phase synchronization is the one that is stable .",
    "anti - phase synchronization is unlikely to be observed ; it will appear only in the case when the two metronomes are started exactly in anti - phases ( @xmath97 ) .    in view of these results",
    ", one can understand why only the stable in - phase synchronized dynamics was observed in our experiments .",
    "the results also emphasize the importance of using realistic model parameters in order to reproduce the observed dynamics .",
    "using the model defined in section 4 , our aim here is to theoretically understand the experimentally obtained trends .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eqm1]),([eqm2 ] ) were numerically integrated using a velocity verlet - type algorithm as the integration method .",
    "a time - step of @xmath91 @xmath90 was chosen .",
    "first we intended to explain the experimental results presented in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "seven metronomes with the same @xmath15 natural frequencies as the experimentally measured ones were considered , and the time - evolution of the kuramoto order parameter was computed .",
    "results obtained for different @xmath2 frequency values are presented in the top panel of figure [ fig8 ] . for the sake of better statistics we averaged the results of @xmath98 simulations .",
    "the obtained results are in good agreement with the experimental results presented in figure [ fig5 ] .    following our experiments ,",
    "we have also studied the time - evolution of the order parameter for different numbers of pendulums , setting the same @xmath99 bpm natural frequency as in the experiments .",
    "again , we averaged the results for @xmath98 independent simulations .",
    "the obtained trend is sketched on the bottom panel of figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "the trend of the simulation results is in agreement with the experimental ones : increasing the number of metronomes results in a decrease in the observed synchronization level . in simulations , however , this decrease is not as evident as in the experiments .",
    "the reason for this could be the oversimplified manner in which we have handled the differences between the metronomes . in our model ,",
    "the only difference between the metronomes are in the @xmath100 values ( the distance of the movable weight from the horizontal suspension axes , see figure [ fig2 ] ) . in our simulations , the non - zero spread of these values",
    "is the sole source of the @xmath16 standard deviation for the frequencies @xmath15 .",
    "however , in reality many other parameters of the metronomes are different , leading to more different model parameters in their equations of motion . as a result of this ,",
    "a more pronounced variation in the synchronization level is expectable .    in spite of the above discussed discrepancy",
    ", the simulation results suggest that our model with realistic model parameters works well for describing the dynamics of the coupled metronome system . in order to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach more quantitatively , we have plotted the simulated equilibrium synchronization level , @xmath101 , as a function of the experimentally determined value , @xmath102 , for the case of @xmath103 metronomes .",
    "the plot from figure [ comp ] suggest that there is a satisfactory correlation .",
    "thus , one can investigate several interesting cases through simulations that are not feasible experimentally .",
    "many interesting questions can be formulated this way . here",
    "we focus however only on clarifying the problems that we have investigated experimentally , namely the influence of the number of oscillators and the chosen natural frequency on the observed synchronization level .",
    "computer simulations will allow us to consider a higher number of metronomes and will also allow for a continuous variation of the metronomes natural frequencies .",
    "particularly , we are interested in clarifying whether , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath104 ) , there is a clear @xmath105 frequency threshold below which there is no synchronization in a system with fixed standard deviation ( @xmath16 ) of the metronomes frequencies .",
    "also , we would like to show that the reason for not obtaining a complete synchronization ( @xmath106 ) of the metronomes is the finite value of @xmath16 .    considering a normal distribution of metronomes natural frequency @xmath15 with a fixed standard deviation around the mean value of the standard deviations presented in table 1 ( @xmath107 bpm ) , we first studied how the kuramoto order parameter , @xmath108 , varies as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "results obtained for a wide range of the number of metronomes , @xmath11 , are plotted in the top panel of figure [ fre ] .",
    "the results plotted in figure [ fre ] suggest that , in the @xmath104 limit , a clear phase - transition like phenomenom emerges . around the value of @xmath109 bpm",
    "the order parameter exhibits a sharp variation , which becomes sharper and sharper as the number of metronomes is increased .",
    "this is a clear sign of phase - transition like behavior . plotting the standard deviation of the order parameter values obtained from different experiments , we get a characteristic peak around the @xmath109 bpm value .",
    "as is expected for a phase - transition - like phenomenon this peak narrows as the number of metronomes on the disk increases .",
    "our next aim is to prove that the reason for not reaching the @xmath106 complete synchronization is the finite standard deviation of the metronomes natural frequencies .",
    "simulations with up to @xmath110 identical metronomes with @xmath99 bpm were considered , and the @xmath111 dynamics of the kuramoto order parameter was investigated .",
    "results for different numbers of metronomes are plotted in figure [ fig11 ] . from these graphs",
    "one can readily observe that in each case the completely synchronized state emerged .",
    "this proves that the lack of complete synchronization is due to the finite spread in the metronomes natural frequencies . from this simulation",
    "we have also learned that variations of the equilibrium order parameter value as a function of @xmath11 is also due to the finite @xmath16 value .",
    "the dynamics of a system composed of coupled metronomes was investigated both by simple experiments and computer simulations . we were interested in finding the conditions for the emergence of synchronization .",
    "contrarily to many previous studies , here the problem was analyzed not from the viewpoint of dynamical systems , but from the viewpoint of collective behavior and emerging synchronization .",
    "the experiments suggest that there is a limiting natural frequency of the metronomes below which spontaneous synchronization is not possible . by increasing the frequency above this limit",
    ", partial synchronization will emerge .",
    "the obtained synchronization level increases monotonically as the natural frequency of the oscillators increases . the experiments also suggest that increasing the number of metronomes in the system leads to a decrease of the observed synchronization level .    in order to better understand the dynamics of the system",
    "a realistic model was built .",
    "we have shown that damping due to friction forces and the presence of driving are both important in order to understand the emerging synchronization .",
    "the parameters of the model were fixed in agreement with the experimental conditions and the equations of motion were integrated numerically .",
    "the model proved to be successful in describing the experimental results , and reproduced the experimentally observed trends .",
    "the model allowed a fine verification of our findings regarding the conditions under which spontaneous synchronization emerges and the trends in the observed synchronization level .",
    "computer simulations suggested that , for an ensemble of metronomes with a fixed standard deviation of their natural frequencies , the order parameter increases as a function of the metronomes average frequency , @xmath2 .",
    "the model also suggests that this increase happens sharply for large ensembles , closely resembling a phase - transition like phenomenon . with the help of the simulations",
    "we have also shown that the reason behind an incomplete synchronization ( @xmath106 ) is the finite spread of the metronomes natural frequencies ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the successes of the discussed model opens the way for many further studies regarding the dynamics of this simple system .",
    "indeed , many other interesting questions can be formulated regarding the influence of the metronome and rotating platform parameters on the obtained synchronization level and the observed trends .",
    "also , one can study systems where the metronomes or groups of metronomes are fixed to different natural frequencies , or where there is an external driving force acting on the system .",
    "the discussed model has the advantage that the equations of motion are easily integrable and the model parameters are realistic , with a direct connection to the parameters of an experimentally realizable system .    finally , we hope that the novel experimental setup and the results presented here will help in clarifying some aspects for one of the oldest problems in physics , namely the spontaneous synchronization of coupled pendulum clocks .",
    "although several similar problems have been considered in previous studies , we have shown that there are still many fascinating aspects that one can investigate in this simple mechanical system .",

    "<S> spontaneous synchronization of an ensemble of metronomes placed on a freely rotating platform is studied experimentally and by computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> a striking in - phase synchronization is observed when the metronomes beat frequencies are fixed above a critical limit . increasing the number of metronomes placed on the disk leads to an observable decrease in the level of the emerging synchronization . a realistic model with experimentally determined parameters </S>",
    "<S> is considered in order to understand the observed results . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions favoring the emergence of synchronization are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the experimentally observed trends can be reproduced by assuming a finite spread in the metronomes natural frequencies . in the limit of large numbers of metronomes , we show that synchronization emerges only above a critical beat frequency value . </S>"
