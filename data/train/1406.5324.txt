    "the aim of this section is to apply the results we have found above to show that in a degenerating sequence of riemann surfaces the blowing up of the distortion of a reference map from a base surface can not be confined to a simply connected set .",

    "local conformal coordinates define the @xmath427 and @xmath428 derivatives and we can define the beltrami coefficient in the usual way .",
