    "[ intro ] general relativity ( gr ) represents , without any doubt , one of the most important achievement of physics .",
    "the predictions made for this theory , like the perihelion shift of mercury , light deflexion , gravitational red shift , gravitational lens , time delay , etc , have given to it the honor which deserves as one of the fundamental theories of physics ( for an excelent review on experimental tests of gr see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand , due to the great technological advance during the past years , today we have increasingly powerful instruments which allow to obtain accurate measures associate to the evoution of compact objects , which represent excellent laboratories for the study of gravity in the strong regime ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "this not only serves to test the theory like never before , but also leaves gr as the only reliable gravitational theory to be used in the analysis of phenomena occurred in the strong field regime .",
    "likewise , the ability of observing increasingly distant objects deep in the universe , and thus with a great gravitational red shift , leads inevitably to the conclusion that only using gr we can obtain an adequate analysis of these phenomena @xcite , @xcite .",
    "furthemore , with the recent results shown by planck @xcite , which improve greatly the previous by wmap @xcite , we can assure that the cosmological models based in gr enjoys a well - deserved and well - earned prestige .",
    "despite the above facts , there are some fundamental questions associated to the gravitational interaction which gr can not answer satisfatory .",
    "this can be broadly grouped in two fundamental issues , which most likely are closely related : 1 ) the inability of gr to explain satisfactorily the dark matter @xcite and dark energy problem without the need of introducing some kind of unknown matter - energy to reconcile what predicts gr with the observed , namely , galactic rotation curves and accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "2 ) the impossibility , so far , to reconcile gr with the standard model of particle physics , or equivalently , the inability to quantize gr .",
    "this has strongly motivated the searching of a gravitational theory beyond gr that helps to explain satisfactorily part of the problems described above .",
    "if the new theory is a consistent quantum theory , this should lead to a generalization of gr at low energy , being likely this extension of gr at low energy which could accounts for the dark matter and dark energy problems .",
    "if the new theory is not a consistent quantum theory for gravity , this should also contain gr in a suitable limit , and somehow show greater tolerance to its quantum description .",
    "extra - dimensional theories , which are mostly inspired by string / m - theory , are among the theories that lead to modifications to gr .",
    "one of these extra - dimensional theories is the braneworld ( bw ) proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite which has been largely studied and which explains , so pretty straightforward , one of the fundamental problems of physics , i.e. the hierarchy problem ( see also the add model @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this theory reduces the fundamental scale to the weak scale by considering extra - dimensional effects , thus explaining the weakness of gravity relative to the other forces . because of this ,",
    "its study and impact on gr is fully justified and is of great importance @xcite , @xcite , although not yet found experimental evidence to support it @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( regarding the dark matter problem , a good agreement between the bw theoretical predictions and observations was found in ref @xcite ) .    despite the great efforts made in recent years and the great understanding of the theory of rs braneworld , we are still far from fully understanding its impact on gravity , mainly in self gravitational systems ( see for instance ref @xcite for an study on star and black hole solutions from the perspective of the bulk ) .",
    "although we have a covariant approach that is useful to study many fundamental aspects of the theory @xcite , there are certain key issues that remain unresolved .",
    "one of these problems is the necessity to clarify the existence of black holes solutions in rs . in order this theory",
    "can be considered a physically consistent theory , it must support , at least , black holes solutions .",
    "today we have some evidences indicating the existence of black holes solutions in rs theory  @xcite , but an exact solution remains unknown so far . indeed , solving the full five - dimensional einstein field equations , something which would be tremendously useful ,",
    "has proven to be an extremely complicated problem ( see , e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "another aspect worth noting is that , even knowing an exact solution , it would produce different solutions in our observed universe , since there are many ways to embed a four - dimensional brane in the five - dimensional bulk .",
    "there are indeed many different ways of embedding , e.g. isometric , conformal , imbeddings , rigid , global , local , analytic etc . @xcite . while it is true that @xmath2 symmetry is popular when considering this point , it is far from being a problem widely studied .",
    "since the complete solution ( bulk plus brane ) remains unknown so far , finding exact solutions , or at least physically acceptable solutions to effective einstein field equations in the brane , might be certainly a good guide to clarify some aspects of the five - dimensional geometry and the way our observed universe is embedded in it .",
    "once a solution is found , we could use campbell - magaard theorems @xcite to extend the brane solution through the bulk , locally at least ( see ref  @xcite for some consequences of campbell - magaard theorems to general relativity ) . to accomplish this , first of all we need to start with a rigorous study of the effective einstein field equations in the four - dimensional brane . a study",
    "that , among other things , clarify the role of five - dimensional effects on the effective four - dimensional field equations , and above all , a study to consolidate a general methodology based on a critical basic requirement : regain gr at low energies .",
    "fortunately , the rs theory has a free parameter , the tension of the brane , which can be used to control this aspect of extreme importance , and which is a nontrivial problem @xcite .",
    "in fact , this fundamental requirement is the basis of the _ minimal geometric deformation approach _ ( mgd ) @xcite , which has allowed , among other things , to generate physically acceptable interior solutions for stellar systems @xcite , physically acceptable exact interior solutions @xcite , to solve the tidally charged exterior solution found in ref @xcite in terms of the adm mass and to study ( micro ) black hole solutions @xcite .    in the rs bw theory",
    ", there are two fields filling our four - dimensional vaccum , namely , the dark radiation @xmath3 and dark pressure @xmath4 , which have an extradimensional origin , and whose effects on stellar structures is not well understood so far . in this paper the mgd approach is used to generate a new physically acceptable interior solution to four - dimensional effective einstein s field equations for a spherically symmetric compact distribution , which is used to elucidate the role of exterior weyl stresses from bulk gravitons on compact stellar distribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "* 2 * the einstein field equations in the brane for a spherically symmetric and static distribution of density @xmath5 and pressure @xmath6 is reminded , as well as the mgd approach . in section * 3 * a new physically acceptable stellar interior solution to einstein s fields equations is generated by breaking a well known general relativistic perfect fluid solution through the mgd approach . in section * 4 * the consequences of dark pressure @xmath4 and dark radiation @xmath3 on stellar structure will be analized through the matching conditions by using two different exterior solutions . in the last section",
    "the conclusions are presented .",
    "in the context of the braneworld , the five - dimensional gravity produces a modification on einstein s field equations in our ( 3 + 1 ) observed universe , the so - called brane .",
    "these modifications can be seen through the energy - momentum tensor , which now has new terms carrying five - dimensional consequences onto the brane : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the brane tension , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 the high - energy and non - local ( from the point of view of a brane observer ) corrections respectively , and @xmath11 a term which depends on all stresses in the bulk but the cosmological constant . in this paper , only the cosmological constant will be considered in the bulk , hence @xmath12 , which implies there will be no exchange of energy between the bulk and the brane , and therefore @xmath13 .    using the line element in schwarzschild - like",

    "( [ usual])-([uu ] ) .    despite the fact that eqs.([usual])-([con1 ] ) represent an indefinite system of equations in the brane , an open problem for which the solution requires more information of the bulk geometry and a better understanding of how our 4d spacetime is embedded in the bulk , it is possible to generate the braneworld version of every general relativistic solution through the mgd approach @xcite . in this approach , from the point of view of a brane observer , the five - dimensional gravity produces a geometric deformation in the radial metric component given by @xmath24 when a solution of @xmath25 einstein s field equations is considered as a possible solution to the braneworld system , given by eqs .",

    "( [ fsolutionmin ] ) represents a minimal geometric deformation in the sense that all sources of the geometric deformation have been removed except those produced by the density and pressure , which are always present in a stellar distribution .",
    "however , there is an even minimal deformation in the case of a dust cloud @xmath33 , but this will not be considered in the present work .",
    "this geometric deformation @xmath31 is the source of the anisotropy induced in the brane , whose explicit form may be found through eq .",
    "( [ pp ] ) , leading to @xmath34 it is clear that this minimal deformation will produce a minimal anisotropy onto the brane .",
    "the heintzmann solution @xcite is a well known spherically symmetric stellar solution for a perfect fluid in general relativity .",
    "this solution satisfies all the elementary criteria for physical acceptability that a stellar solution must satisfy , namely , regular at the origin , pressure and density defined positive , well defined mass and radius , monotonic decrease of the density and pressure with increasing radius , dominant energy condition satisfied , subliminal sound speed , etc . because of the above , the heintzmann solution represents a very attractive candidate to be considered in the braneworld context through the minimal geometric deformation approach .",
