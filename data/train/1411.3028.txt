    "topological quantum codes built from qubits ( @xmath1-dimensional quantum systems ) play a central role in architectures for fault - tolerant quantum computing at the forefront of current research @xcite .",
    "the surface code @xcite , and the related toric code @xcite , are prominent examples of such codes .",
    "compared with other quantum error correcting codes , they posses the key experimental benefit of requiring only local interactions and yet , under realistic noise models , they have been shown to achieve the highest reported fault - tolerant thresholds @xcite .",
    "recent developments have shown that employing @xmath2-dimensional quantum systems , or qudits , as the building blocks for fault - tolerant schemes may offer some important advantages .",
    "for example , an integral part of many fault - tolerant schemes is the distillation of magic states @xcite  a procedure necessary to achieve universal computation  where generalization to higher dimensions has resulted in improved distillation thresholds and lower overheads in the number of qudit magic states @xcite .",
    "moreover , threshold investigations of the qudit toric code with noise - free syndrome measurements have shown that , for a standard independent noise model , the error correction threshold increases significantly with increasing qudit dimension @xcite , although we caution that it is difficult to fairly compare noise rates between systems of different dimension .",
    "although it is more challenging to realize qudit quantum systems experimentally , recent work has demonstrated the ability to coherently control and perform operations in single 16-dimensional atomic systems with high fidelity @xcite , with the implementation of high fidelity multi - qudit interactions still to be achieved .",
    "a surface code is a stabilizer code with local stabilizer generators .",
    "qudits are associated with the edges of a 2d square lattice . in order to store the encoded information for an arbitrary length of time",
    ", active error detection must be performed periodically in order to prevent the errors from accumulating beyond the capability of the code to correct them , see fig .",
    "[ fig : datastructure ] . in every round of error correction all the stabilizer generators are measured to obtain the _",
    "syndrome_. the syndrome is then processed by the _ decoder_the classical algorithm that outputs a correction operator . in a realistic environment",
    "both the physical systems and the stabilizer measurements are prone to errors , and hence the decoder must be able to take both of these types of errors into account @xcite .",
    "decoders are often developed for the simpler case where measurement error is neglected . however , there is a well established and elegant method for generalizing measurement - noise - free decoders for topological codes to the fully fault - tolerant setting @xcite .",
    "the noisy syndrome measurements are repeated , extending the two - dimensional surface representing the code to a three - dimensional data structure , where time represents an extra dimension .",
    "remarkably , the change from two to three dimensions allows most decoder algorithms developed for noise - free measurements to be applied largely unchanged in this more general setting .",
    "the most widely used decoding algorithm for topological codes remains the minimum - weight perfect matching algorithm ( mwpma ) . however , this algorithm has a number of disadvantages . for a distance @xmath3 surface code , with error - free measurements , the run time for a basic implementation of the mwpm algorithm scales with @xmath4 , and for with error - prone measurements this run time increases to @xmath5 .",
    "a more refined fault - tolerant implementation for the qubit surface code scales with @xmath6 @xcite , and under certain assumptions a run time complexity that is independent of @xmath3 can be attained @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the main disadvantage of mwpma is that it is not suitable for qudit surface codes with @xmath7 . for these reasons ,",
    "the development of alternative decoding algorithms is currently a very active research area @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we introduce a fault - tolerant decoding algorithm which overcomes both of the disadvantages of the mwpma .",
    "the algorithm , which extends the hard - decision renormalization group ( hdrg ) decoder proposed by bravyi and haah @xcite , has a fast typical run time of @xmath8 and can be applied to qudit surface codes of any dimension @xmath9 .    for a given noise model",
    ", the error threshold represents an upper bound on the noise level for which increasing the code distance increases the probability of successful error correction .",
    "we denote the threshold for a given qudit dimension by @xmath10 .",
    "a widely - studied qubit error model ( described below in more detail ) is the simple _ uncorrelated noise _ model where @xmath11 and @xmath12 pauli errors on individual code qubits and bit - flip errors on the syndrome measurement outcomes each occur independently with probability @xmath13 .",
    "for this noise model , the optimal threshold for the qubit toric code is known to be @xmath14% @xcite while the threshold obtained with the mwpma decoder is @xmath15% @xcite .",
    "the hdrg decoder we study here attains a threshold of @xmath16 for the qubit code and may also be used with qudit surface codes of any dimension . for the qudit generalization of the uncorrelated noise model ( introduced below ) , the decoder achieves a threshold value which increases monotonically with the qudit dimension @xmath9 , until it reaches a saturated value of around @xmath17% .",
    "we show that this saturating behaviour is due to a syndrome percolation effect which upper bounds the acheivable threshold . to overcome the percolation threshold we have constructed a procedure executed _ before _ running the hdrg , which we call the _ initialization step _ @xcite . the algorithm implemented in this `",

    "this generalization is already present in kitaev s seminal paper @xcite and has been written about extensively elsewhere @xcite . for completeness , however , we shall provide an overview of qudit stabilizer codes and the qudit surface code .",

    "this allows us to restrict the discussion to @xmath11-type errors since results for @xmath12-type errors will be analogous .",
    "a single @xmath57-type error is detected by two adjacent plaquettes , except when it occurs on a smooth boundary , see fig .",
    "[ fig : errors](a ) . in general , a string of @xmath57-type errors is detected by plaquettes contiguously along the path of the string , as shown by the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors](b ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the qubit case ( @xmath59 ) where only the end - points of the string give rise to non - trivial plaquette measurements , a situation that can also arise for general @xmath2 when the errors along the string possess identical errors .",
    "this observation suggests that in higher @xmath9 the syndrome reveals more information about the path of the errors on the lattice .",
    "indeed it is this information that , if exploited correctly by the decoder , can lead to improved error correction performance , as shown by their higher threshold values , as @xmath2 increases .",
    "we also introduce the concept of syndrome _ transportation _ : a syndrome can be transported in any direction by applying the appropriate operator as illustrated by the example in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors](c ) .",
    "moreover , by transporting one syndrome to the location of a second , they are _ fused _ into a single syndrome such that their charges are added ( modulo @xmath9 ) .",

    "[ sechdrg ] when describing our decoder .    generally speaking ,",
    "the aim of the decoder is to use the information given by the syndrome to return a correction operator that restores the code to its original state .",
    "more formally , let us denote an arbitrary configuration of @xmath57-type errors on the 2d surface code by the set @xmath60 , and the corresponding plaquette measurement outcomes by the set @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the outcome of the measurement and the subscripts @xmath63 are the coordinates of the plaquettes , so that @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we will often refer to the outcome @xmath66 as the _ charge _ of the measurement .",
    "then we say that a decoder @xmath67 takes in the syndrome @xmath68 and returns a correction configuration @xmath69 .",
    "we denote this map by @xmath70 .",
    "the decoder succeeds if @xmath71 and fails if @xmath72 .    in the next section",
    "we will give a formal description of the noise model and describe the method for the fault - tolerant simulation .",
    "in the literature it is common to test fault - tolerant decoders with a simple error model described by a single parameter @xmath13 . for ease of comparison , we shall follow this convention and use the same error model here .",
    "although this model is not likely to be particularly close to the noise which occurs in physical systems , it has the advantage that it allows @xmath11- and @xmath12-type errors and their correction to be modelled independently .",
    "it is thus the standard noise model used to benchmark new decoders .    between each round of syndrome measurements",
    "we assume that each physical qudit is independently subject to an error channel which applies error operator @xmath73 such that @xmath74 with equal probability @xmath75 , followed by an error channel which applies error operator @xmath42 such that @xmath74 with equal probability @xmath75 .",
    "we then assume that the outcome of each syndrome measurement @xmath27 undergoes an error which maps @xmath27 to @xmath76 for @xmath74 with equal probability @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath11-type errors , @xmath12-type errors and measurement errors are uncorrelated this is often called the _ uncorrelated noise model_.    we estimate the threshold via a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we shall study a distance @xmath3 code for a variety of values of @xmath3 .",
    "this corresponds to an @xmath77 surface code grid . for simplicity",
    ", we shall let the number of time - steps in our simulation also equal @xmath3 .",
    "the simulation proceeds by first generating a 3d data structure of @xmath3 time steps of the accumulated history of the physical qudit errors and the measurement errors . the corresponding syndrome measurement outcomes , taking into account both of these error sources , are then computed .    in order to achieve the close analogy for the relationship between errors and syndromes in the 2d measurement - error - free and 3d general case ,",
    "dennis et al @xcite showed that it is most convenient to represent the history of the syndrome outcomes as a 3d grid of syndrome _",
    "changes_.    let us denote @xmath78 as the set of syndrome outcomes at the @xmath79-th time step .",
    "the set of syndrome changes @xmath80 at time step @xmath79 is then defined as the elementwise difference , modulo @xmath9 , of @xmath78 and @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 , where ` @xmath83 ' denotes subtraction modulo @xmath2 and we assume that @xmath84 .",
    "each set of syndrome changes corresponds to a 2d grid of integers , and we combine these grids into a 3d cubic structure with @xmath85 at the bottom and @xmath86 at the top .",
    "we call this grid the syndrome changes history and denote it @xmath87 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce a cartesian coordinate system to refer to the elements of @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath88 corresponds to the syndrome change at grid point @xmath89 at time step @xmath79 .",
    "the input to the decoder is the 3d syndrome _ changes _",
    "history @xmath90 .",
    "the decoder takes the syndrome changes history and returns a 3d correction operator @xmath91 . to convert this to a physical correction operator that can be applied in 2d we ignore time - like edges and combine the two - dimensional layers corresponding to each time step , to form a 2d correction operator @xmath92 that corrects the accumulated errors at the last time step of the surface code .",
    "in other words , the resultant correction operator , @xmath92 , is the sum ( modulo @xmath9 ) of the correction at each qudit location at each time step , i.e. @xmath93 .",
    "we say the decoder has succeeded when the product of the accummulated errors on the qudits , and the returned correction operator is within the stabilizer of the code .",
    "if we are operating below threshold then following the 3d decoding we expect almost all of the errors to have been corrected .",
    "there is a finite probability however that some small number of errors will remain after the fault - tolerant decoding has been performed . in a realistic",
    "setting the error correction would proceed in this way , eliminating all but a small number of errors in each block of @xmath3 time steps . at the point when the state is read out , these small errors can be accounted for by taking a majority vote on the measurements of the logical operators .    for the purposes of the simulation",
    "however , we need to determine whether the fault - tolerant decoder has introduced a logical error . the conventional way to overcome this problem is to perform an additional round of error correction in 2d with noise - free syndrome measurements , after which we can be certain that all the errors are corrected and a parity check will reveal whether any logical errors have been introduced .",
    "the hdrg decoder has a simple motivation behind its construction : when the error rate is sufficiently low we expect any errors arising on the surface code lattice to be sparse .",
    "this in turn means that syndromes are likely to occur in small , well - separated clusters .",
    "the hdrg decoder aims to identify clusters of syndromes generated by such local errors and correct them locally within each cluster .",
    "if these clusters have been correctly identified , and the clusters are each small enough that they do not span the lattice , then this strategy results in the decoder computing a correction operator that will correct all errors with high probability . in this section",
    "we shall give a formal definition of these concepts in the fault - tolerant setting .      the main concept required for the description of the hdrg decoder",
    "is that of a _",
    "metric_a geometric distance function between any pair of elements of a set . in our case",
    ", we wish to associate a metric between pairs of syndromes in the set @xmath94 .",
    "the metric we use is the manhattan distance , denoted here by @xmath95 , which maps two syndromes as follows : @xmath96 see fig .",
    "[ fig : metric ] for an illustration for how the region defined by this metric grows .",
    "we say that two syndromes are @xmath97-_connected _ if the distance between them is less than or equal to @xmath97 . for a given metric value @xmath95",
    ", we define a cluster @xmath98 to be the set non - trivial syndromes such that every syndrome within the cluster is @xmath97-connected to at least one other syndrome within that cluster .",

    "if this charge is zero , we call the cluster _ neutral_. such a cluster can be annihilated by fusing all of the syndromes contained in the cluster locally , meaning that the pauli correction operator will have support only within the cluster .",
    "if the charge is non - zero but the cluster is @xmath97-connected to any of the three smooth boundaries ( two spatial and one time ) then we call the cluster _ boundary - neutral_. clusters of this type can be annihilated by fusing the syndromes locally and then connecting the remaining charge to the boundary it overlaps .",
    "the hdrg decoder involves multiple levels of decoding to fuse together all the elements in @xmath94 and return the resultant correction operator . every decoding level @xmath102 is associated with a distance determining the connectivity of the disjoint clusters at that level . for the metric",
    "we have defined we will use @xmath103 starting with @xmath104 .",
    "this means that the cluster connectivity increases exponentially as we increase the decoding levels . at each level ,",
    "only the neutral ( and boundary - neutral ) clusters are fused , leaving any charged clusters to be combined to form neutral clusters at subsequent levels .",

    "the decoder stops when there are no non - trivial syndromes remaining .",
    "the crucial feature of this decoder is that part of the total correction operator is fixed after each level of decoding . in classical coding theory , decoding algorithms exhibiting such a feature are referred to as a _ hard - decision _ decoders .",
    "an explicit example for a small lattice simulation is illustrated in app .",
    "[ app : decoder ] .",
    "the dominant parts of our decoder algorithm that contribute to the run time complexity are the identification of the @xmath97-connected cluster of syndromes ( clustering ) and the determination of the pauli operator that eliminates the syndrome ( fusion ) .",
    "we shall look at each of these processes in turn and argue that for lower error rates , we expect a run time scaling of @xmath8 and even in the worse case this scaling will be no greater than @xmath4 .",
    "let us first consider the limit in which error rates are low and the errors are extremely sparse . in the clustering part of the algorithm at a given level @xmath102 , the algorithm searches a constant number of plaquettes @xmath108 around every non - trivial syndrome .    in the case of extremely sparse syndromes",
    "the total number of syndromes is @xmath8 and the decoder will only need to run at the first level @xmath109 . thus in this limit ,",
    "the dependence of the run time complexity on @xmath3 for this part of the algorithm will be @xmath8 .    in the worst case scenario we consider the most pessimistic estimates for the clustering step of the algorithm .",

    "there will be @xmath8 syndromes and the dependence of the run time complexity on @xmath3 for this part of the algorithm will thus be @xmath111 to leading order .    for the fusion part of the algorithm , the syndromes can all be moved to a single point in the box enclosing the cluster .",
    "this will take a time that scales with the size of the enclosing box , and the maximum size of the box scales with @xmath112 . note that since the time complexity of modular arithmetic is independent of modulus @xmath9 , thus this scaling is independent of @xmath9 .      to estimate the threshold",
    "we simulate the entire process of generating @xmath3 time steps of errors and noisy syndromes , followed by decoding the syndromes .",

    "[ fig : initial ] ) . in general",
    ", the initialization step has an overhead of @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the number of paths for each syndrome for the @xmath143th initialization level .",
    "specifically , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , for the first four initialization levels respectively .",
    "we simulated the enhanced - hdrg decoder in the same way described in sec .",
    "[ sec : hdrgthresholds ] .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : thresholds ] .",
    "we see that the asymptotic threshold achieved for four levels of the initialization step is around @xmath146% .",
    "although the improved thresholds for high @xmath9 suggest that we are successfully able to disrupt the syndrome percolation using this technique , we still observe some saturation of the thresholds . to test this , we performed syndrome percolation simulations using the initialization step prior to the test for percolation .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : percolation ] .",
    "we see that the percolation threshold still upper - bounds the enhanced - hdrg thresholds for the corresponding initialization step .    despite its success for very high qudit dimensions",
    "the enhanced - hdrg is not useful for low qudit dimensions , where the initialization step disrupts the syndromes in a way that results in a _",
    "lower _ threshold .",
    "this can be understood as a result of using a decoding strategy that is too local  the neutral sub - clusters identified are in fact fragments of larger errors and the syndromes do not contain enough information to reconstruct them correctly .",
    "this suggests that the syndromes for very high qudit dimensions contain enough information to allow many rounds of initialization to keep improving the threshold . for smaller qudit dimensions",
    "however , we see there is an optimal number of initialization rounds that should be performed , for example for @xmath147 we found that the two initialization levels is optimal .",
    "we have presented a modified version of the hdrg decoder that was first introduced by bravyi and haah in @xcite and studied its decoding performance for the surface code with noisy syndrome measurements .",
    "the main difference in our version is the use of a more refined metric which has led to an improved threshold .",
    "we have chosen the manhattan distance metric @xmath95 , whereas bravyi and haah considered the @xmath148 metric . in our investigations we discovered that the majority of the syndromes are cleared at the first level of decoding .",
    "this means that having a more refined metric matters more at @xmath149 than it does at higher decoding levels .",
    "the @xmath97 metric ensures that the clusters at the first decoding level are as connected as possible by allowing a single syndrome to be connected only to its @xmath150 nearest neighbour plaquettes .",
    "this refinement of the metric is the reason for our improved thresholds .",
    "we found that , similarly to the measurement noise - free setting , for all but the smallest dimension @xmath9 , syndrome percolation places an upper bound on the decoder threshold for the hdrg decoder .",
    "we have demonstrated that this can be overcome by adopting an extra initialization step , which , by scanning for locally neutral sub - clusters , breaks up the percolated lattice allowing the decoder to succeed above the percolation threshold .",
    "this has a particularly stark effect for high dimensions , increasing the threshold by almost a factor of two .",
    "the uncorrelated noise model chosen here was adopted for ease of comparison with other decoders .",
    "however , an uncorrelated noise model is unlikely to be encountered in experiment .",
    "when the dimension is high , in an isotropic depolarising noise model , there would be a high correlation between the presence of @xmath11-type and @xmath12-type errors . a decoder which used this information",
    "might achieve significantly higher thresholds .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the decoder presented here to possess an error threshold for any noise model acting independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with respect to individual qudits and also non - i.i.d .",
    "noise models where the correlation between qudit errors is limited . testing these possibilities is a pertinent open question .",
    "a remarkable feature of this decoder is the independence of its run time complexity with respect to qudit dimension .",
    "this is in stark contrast to other known qudit decoders .",
    "for example , the soft - decision renormalization group decoder in the fault - tolerant setting @xcite has a straightforward implementation in higher dimensions but comes with a cost of a polynomial overhead in @xmath9 which means its applicability is limited to low dimensions .    to make our comparisons with other decoding algorithms more concrete in the qubit case ,",
    "further research should focus on a full gate - error simulation of the hdrg in the low noise regime .",
    "a comparison of success probability vs error rate in this regime would allow one to compare overheads , the most relevant figure of merit for judging the relative performance of these decoders .",
    "given the excellent performance of the mwpma , the most important applications of the methods here will be for codes where mwpma is not a suitable decoder .",
    "the surface codes studied in this paper are not the only quantum error correcting codes for which hdrg type decoders could be beneficial .",
    "an efficient decoding algorithm for the more exotic ldpc code , the 4d hyperbolic code , was introduced by hastings with similar ` greedy local matching ' principles as the hdrg decoder @xcite .",
    "other ldpc codes exist for which efficient decoders have not yet been identified @xcite .",
    "the development of computationally light fault - tolerant decoders for these codes is essential if they are to be practical .",
    "hdrg decoders have demonstrated the efficiency needed to support large scale fault - tolerant error correction on the surface code and a flexibility which may make them well suited to unlock the potential of future novel topological codes .",

    "finally , there are five boundary - neutral clusters ( yellow , purple , light green , orange and pink ) . the total charge of these clusters do not add up to zero , but since they are 1-connected to one of the boundaries they can be fused with that boundary . when the cluster is fused with the time boundary , no physical correction is applied .",
