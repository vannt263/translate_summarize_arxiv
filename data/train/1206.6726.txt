    "spin - orbit coupling is a key mechanism in many prominent physical phenomena ranging from the electrically generated bulk spin polarization,@xcite to the dissipationless spin current in bulk semiconductors , @xcite to the spin - hall effect in metals @xcite and two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "@xcite in searching for an efficient mechanism for magnetization switching , interplay between spin - orbit coupling and magnetism@xcite has brought a new member to the spin - transfer torque community , @xcite i.e. , the spin - orbit torque .",
    "diluted magnetic semiconductors provide an ideal platform to theoretically@xcite and experimentally @xcite study the current - driven magnetization dynamics induced by spin - orbit torques .",
    "simply speaking , spin - orbit torque operates through the competition between the exchange and spin - orbit fields in polarizing the itinerant electrons ( or holes ) and gives rise to a torque on the ferromagnetic order parameter .",
    "when it comes to magnetization switching , the advantage of spin - orbit torque over the conventional one is clear : there is no need to employ a separate ferromagnet as polarizer .",
    "recent experiments on current - driven magnetization dynamics performed in multilayer systems @xcite have also achieved current - induced switching in a single ferromagnet film sandwiched between a heavy metal and metal oxide , which indicates the presence of spin - orbit coupling and therefore spin - orbit torque as a potential driving force .",
    "these systems  mostly consisting of conducting interfaces between ferromagnetic metal films and heavy metals ( or metal oxides)are nowadays often referred to as ferromagnetic heterostructures . a viable candidate believed to exist in such structures is the rashba - type spin - orbit interaction due to inversion symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite theoretical efforts are made to uncover dominant components of the spin - orbit torque induced by the rashba coupling .",
    "@xcite they usually treat the coexistence of ferromagnetism and spin - orbit coupling as an intrinsic property .",
    "the underlying physics is fairly simple and intuitive : when a charge current is applied in the structure , the rashba spin - orbit coupling creates an effective magnetic field ( coined as the rashba field @xmath0 ) ; so long as @xmath0 polarizes charge carriers to the direction that is misaligned with the magnetization direction @xmath1 , a spin torque emerges to act on the magnetization and to induce switching .",
    "this torque , named as rashba spin - orbit torque or rashba torque , has gained much attention from academia as well as industries and is exactly the central topic of this paper .",
    "both theories and experiments have shown that the rashba torque shall , in general , comprise two major components , i.e. a fieldlike torque ( or in - plane component ) and a damping - like torque ( or out - of - plane component ) .",
    "more recently , the symmetry of spin - orbit torque has been scrutinized experimentally .",
    "the experiments by garello et al reveal an intriguing yet complex angular dependence on the magnetization direction.@xcite this observation challenges the commonly accepted form described by in - plane and out - of - plane components .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a systematic theoretical study on the spin - orbit torque and spin dynamics in a ferromagnetic ultrathin film without structure inversion symmetry .",

    "[ sec : diffusion - equation ] , we employ the quantum kinetic equation to derive coupled diffusion equations for the charge and spin densities .",

    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the article .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that we make no attempt to argue that the rashba model provides the ultimate answer to the spin - orbit torque in ferromagnetic heterostructures .",
    "spin - hall effect @xcite in the nonmagnetic metal layer provides an alternative explanation to several experiments.@xcite however , we must admit , as haney et al . have pointed out , both explanations have their strength and weakness.@xcite despite the limitations , the results presented here and their agreement with experiments lead us to believe such a simple model does shed light on the nature of the spin - orbit torque in ferromagnetic thin films .",

    "we assume that the exchange interaction and spin - orbit splitting are smaller than the fermi energy , while leaving the ratio of the spin - orbit coupling to the exchange interaction arbitrary .    before we proceed to detailed discussion",
    ", we clarify the validity of such a quasi two - dimensional model . in principle , carrier transport in the system under consideration is a three - dimensional phenomenon in which size effect may arise . here",
    ", our quasi two - dimensional rashba model assumes a direct coupling between the exchange and effective rashba field and is thus requiring ultrathin layers in which diffusive motion normal to the thin film plane can be neglected .",
    "haney et al have recently conducted a thorough discussion using a three - dimensional semiclassical boltzmann description in a bilayer structure augmented by an interfacial rashba spin - orbit coupling.@xcite their results are consistent with the ones obtained from quasi - two - dimensional transport modeled in refs .",

    "<S> ferromagnetic heterostructures provide an ideal platform to explore the nature of spin - orbit torques arising from the interplay mediated by itinerant electrons between a rashba - type spin - orbit coupling and a ferromagnetic exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> for such a prototypic system , we develop a set of coupled diffusion equations to describe the diffusive spin dynamics and spin - orbit torques . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the spin torque and its two prominent  out - of - plane and in - plane  components for a wide range of relative strength between the rashba coupling and ferromagnetic exchange . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry and angular dependence of the spin torque emerging from our simple rashba model is in an agreement with experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the spin diffusion equation can be generalized to incorporate dynamic effect such as spin pumping and magnetic damping . </S>"
