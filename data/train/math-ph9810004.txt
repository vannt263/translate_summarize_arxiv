    "the adiabatic limit is @xmath3 .",
    "the period @xmath4 is a smooth function which is time independent in the past , @xmath5 , and in the distant future , @xmath6 .",
    "a graph showing a possible variation of @xmath4 is shown in fig .",
    "2 .        figure 2:0.125 in an adiabatic variation    an adiabatic invariant is an approximately conserved quantity whose deviation from constant can be made arbitrarily small for large @xmath2 , uniformly in @xmath7 and _ for all times_. for the harmonic oscillator the adiabatic invariant is @xmath8 the special properties of this particular combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be seen from its equations of motion : @xmath11 @xmath12 is compactly supported ( because @xmath13 is ) , and appears to be @xmath14 in @xmath2 .",
    "but , for the ( time independent ) harmonic oscillator the time average over one period of the kinetic energy equals the time average of the potential energy .",
    "so , for large @xmath2 , the change of @xmath15 in one period is small : @xmath16 . because of this adiabatic invariants give precise information on the long time behavior even though the total variation in the hamiltonian is finite .",
    "a remarkable fact about adiabatic invariants is that _ for large times _ the error is essentially exponentially small with @xmath2 if @xmath4 is smooth @xcite : @xmath17 ( the error is , in general , not exponentially small for @xmath18 . ) in certain circles an exponentially small error is sometimes taken to be the defining property of adiabatic invariant , so that proving an adiabatic theorem it taken to imply proving an exponentially small bound on the error .",
    "this , to our opinion , is not a satisfactory definition of the notion of adiabatic invariant , and instead we shall stick with the definition given above , namely , that adiabatic invariants are conserved up to an error that is uniformly bounded for all times , and can be made arbitrarily small with @xmath2 .    a link of classical adiabatic invariants with quantum mechanics that was emphasized by ehrenfest @xcite focused on the observation that adiabatic invariants are related to quantum numbers .",
    "for the ( time independent ) harmonic oscillator the particular combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) is a function of quantum numbers : @xmath19",
    "ehrenfest observation had much influence in the early days of quantum mechanics , and in particular motivated the work of born and fock @xcite on the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics . in quantum theory one",
    "is interested is solving the initial value problem @xmath20 with @xmath21 a vector in hilbert space and @xmath22 a self adjoint operator .",
    "we shall assume , as we did in the previous section , that @xmath23 is time independent in the past , @xmath5 , and distant future , @xmath6 , and is a smooth operator valued function of @xmath7 . in the case",
    "that @xmath23 is an unbounded operator , like the schrdinger operator , the notion of smoothness needs some clarification .",
    "we shall not get into this here .",
    "changing variables one writes the initial value problem as @xmath24 the adiabatic limit is @xmath25 .",
    "adiabatic theorems in quantum mechanics relate the solutions of the initial value problem to spectral properties .",
    "the oldest result of this kind is due to born and fock who studied hamiltonians with _ discrete and simple _ spectrum , fig .",
    "3 .        figure 3:0.125 in spectrum in born fock theory    born and fock showed that if the initial data are @xmath26 , with @xmath27 an eigenvector of @xmath28 , then @xmath29 is close to an eigenvector @xmath30 of @xmath23 with particular choice of phase : @xmath31 for large times , @xmath6 , outside the support of @xmath32 , much stronger result hold : the error is essentially exponentially small in @xmath2 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "kato generalized the result of born and fock .",
    "he showed that the assumption of spectral simplicity of @xmath23 can be removed , and so can the assumption that the spectrum is discrete , fig .",
    "these generalizations are important for applications to atomic physics where some continuous spectrum is always present , and degeneracies are ubiquitous .",
    "but , perhaps more importantly , kato introduced an essentially new method of proving the adiabatic theorem that we shall now describe .",
    "figure 4:0.125 in spectrum in kato s theory    kato s idea was to introduce a geometric evolution which satisfies the adiabatic theorem without an error .",
    "that is , a unitary @xmath33 , so that : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a spectral projection for @xmath23 , and @xmath36 . the second step is to compare the physical evolution , @xmath37 , generated by @xmath38 with @xmath39 and show that the two are close .",
    "it turns out that both steps involve looking into commutator equations . if we let @xmath40 denote the generator of the geometric evolution @xmath33 , it is not difficult to see that it must satisfy @xmath41= i\\,\\dot p(s).\\ ] ] using the fact that for any projection @xmath42 @xmath43 one checks that @xmath44,\\ ] ] solves the commutator equation , with @xmath40 which is manifestly close to @xmath23 .    to compare @xmath37 and @xmath33",

    "now , like the situation for the classical adiabatic invariants , even though @xmath49 is not small , the change in @xmath50 is small .",
    "this is where a second commutator equation enters .",
    "suppose that the commutator equation @xmath51=[\\dot p(s ) , p(s)]\\label{ce}\\ ] ] has a smooth and bounded solution @xmath52 .",

    "the gap condition is a condition for the solvability of the commutator equation , eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) . indeed , suppose there is a gap in the spectrum so that the spectral projection @xmath42 is associated with a contour @xmath55 in the complex plane that lies entirely in the resolvent set , fig .",
    "5 .        figure 5:0.125 in a contour @xmath55 in the complex plane    a solution to the commutator equation is @xmath56 and , as usual @xmath57 is bounded for @xmath58 .",
    "if the size of the gap is @xmath59 then @xmath60 using kato s method various adiabatic theorems have been proven see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic theorem described in the previous section relied on a gap condition .",
    "how serious is this ?    in the proof of kato the gap condition guarantees the existence of a bounded solution to the commutator equation given by @xmath52 of eq .",
    "( [ x ] ) .",
    "the bound eq.([b ] ) blows up at the gap shrinks to zero and there is no _ a - priori _ bounded solution to the commutator equation .",
    "this suggests that the gap condition is essential .",
    "a second argument leading to the same conclusion is a dimensional argument .",
    "the adiabatic limit needs a intrinsic time scale so that @xmath2 can be measured in dimensionless units . otherwise",
    "the notion of large @xmath2 depends on a choice of a unit and is meaningless . in the case of the classical harmonic oscillator",
    "the intrinsic time scale is set by @xmath10 . in the quantum case , a gap and planck constant dictates an intrinsic time scale . in the absence of a gap ,",
    "this time scale is lost .",
    "this suggests that the gap condition is essential and there should be no _ general _ adiabatic theorem in its absence .",
    "let us now describe two arguments that say the opposite .",
    "the first refers once again to the work of born and fock .",
    "born and fock ( and also kato ) considered the more delicate adiabatic theorem for crossing energy levels , fig .",
    "6 , and proved an adiabatic theorem in this case        figure 6:0.125 in crossing eigenvalues in born fock theory    since the energy levels cross , the gap closes . for the case of linear crossing born and fock showed that eq .",
    "( [ error ] ) is replaced by @xmath61 the time scale for this problem is dictated by the slope of the energy curves at the crossing point .",
    "these results have since been considerably strengthened and extended @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a gap conditions controls the rate at which the adiabatic limit is approached , but an adiabatic theorem does not really require a gap condition .    a second argument supporting the view that a gap condition is only technical is a physical argument .",
    "gaps in the spectrum are indeed prevalent in quantum mechanical systems , but they are no gaps in quantum electrodynamics : the interaction with radiation eliminates the gaps .",
    "suppose that a charged quantum mechanical system , initially at the ground state , is slowly rotated",
    ". the adiabatic theorem would fail if the number of photons generated by the slow rotation does not go to zero in the adiabatic limit .",
    "let us estimate this number .",
    "the power radiated by a charged system in classical electrodynamics is proportional to the acceleration squared , i.e. to @xmath62 .",
    "hence the total radiated energy is of the order @xmath63 .",
    "since a typical radiated photon will , presumably , have frequency of order @xmath64 the number of radiated photons is of order @xmath65 .",
    "this goes to zero in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this argument , in spite of its shortcomings , suggests that the gap condition , at least in the context of qed , is not really essential .",
    "a general adiabatic theorem without a gap condition was given in @xcite .",
    "the point is that all the adiabatic theorem really needs is a distinguished smooth family of finite dimensional spectral projections , so that the adiabatic evolution has a distinguished subspace to follow .",
    "the proof works for eigenvalues embedded in some essential spectrum , or for eigenvalues at the threshold of essential spectrum , as one would expect to find in qed , fig .",
    "it is essential for this result that the distinguished spectral subspace is _",
    "finite dimensional_. let us begin by stating the theorem:_theorem : suppose that @xmath35 is a finite rank spectral projection , which is at least twice differentiable ( as a bounded operator ) , for the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath23 , which is bounded and differentiable for all @xmath66 $ ] . then , the evolution of the initial state @xmath67 , according to eq .",
    "( [ scrodinger ] ) , is such that in the adiabatic limit @xmath68 for all @xmath7 . _",
    "figure 7:0.125 in an eigenvalue at threshold    remarks : the theorem is stated for bounded self adjoint operators @xmath23 . as it stands it does not apply to schrdinger operator .",
    "the extension to unbounded operators is a technical problem which can be handled by known functional analytic methods .",
    "we choose not to phrase the result for the general case for several reasons .",
    "the first is that the technical issues will obscure the basic idea which is simple .",
    "the second is that the essence of the adiabatic theorem is an infrared problem .",
    "the unboundedness of schrdinger operators is an ultraviolet problem .",
    "it is a conceptual advantage to keep the two issues separate .",
    "the basic idea is to replace kato s commutator equation , eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) , by a definition of a new quantity @xmath69 : @xmath51=[\\dot p(s ) , p(s)]+y(s),\\ ] ] and take @xmath52 to be @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an approximate characteristic function of @xmath23 , which is @xmath72 localized near the relevant eigenvalue , whose range is in @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is bounded , by construction , for @xmath75 and its norm diverges as @xmath76 . at the same time , and this is the crucial point , @xmath77 provided @xmath35 is finite dimensional . chasing the argument of kato one",
    "then finds that the adiabatic theorem holds , and the price one has to pay for the absence of a gap is the loss of control on the rate at which the adiabatic limit is approached . instead of eq .",
    "( [ error ] ) on gets @xmath78 that is , the error can be made arbitrarily small with @xmath2 , but the rate is undetermined .",
    "we conclude with an interpretation of the result . for an isolated eigenvalue",
    "the gap in the spectrum protects against tunneling out of the spectral subspace . in the case",
    "that the eigenvalue in question is embedded in essential spectrum there is no gap to protect against tunneling out .",
    "but , since the essential spectrum is associated with eigenfunctions supported near infinity , there is small overlap with the eigenfunction in question , and the protection against tunneling comes from this fact .",
    "adiabatic theorems of classical and quantum mechanics are a developed subject with rich and fertile history . in this short overview , based an a talk by one of us",
    ", we reviewed a small corner of this field , the one close to its foundations and characterized by elementary results .",
    "there are many beautiful and sophisticated results that we did not have the opportunity to review .",
    "these include : classical adiabatic invariants for integrable systems to all orders @xcite ; adiabatic invariants for chaotic systems @xcite ; quantum adiabatic theorems to all orders @xcite ; landau - zener formulas @xcite ; adiabatic invariants in scattering theory@xcite ; adiabatic invariants in @xmath79 algebras and models of quantum fields @xcite and geometry and adiabatic curvature @xcite .",
