    "once separations of central two supermassive black holes are around kilo - pcs scale , double - peaked narrow emission lines could be expected , if there are significant velocities along the line - of - sight of the dual supermassive black holes .",
    "therefore , double - peaked narrow emission lines can be treated as one indicator of candidate dual supermassive black holes with separations about kilo - pcs , such as the following reported well studied candidates among agns with double - peaked narrow emission lines , sdss j1048 ( zhou et al .",

    "( 2011 ) for 31 double - peaked narrow line agns and in fu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for 42 double - peaked narrow line agns , one conclusion has been reported that among their small sample of double - peaked narrow line agns , scenarios involving a single agn can produce double - peaked narrow emission lines with considerations of gas kinematics for large part of the double - peaked narrow line agns , only a small part of double - peaked narrow line agns probably contain dual supermassive black holes .",
    "furthermore , besides the proposed kinematic models for double - peaked narrow emission lines , there is one another non - kinematic model , the model based on radiative transfer effects in optically thick sources ( more recent detailed discussions on the non - kinematic model can be found in elitzur , ramos & ceccarelli 2012 ) , which can also be well applied to explain observed double - peaked narrow emission lines . and moreover , as what have been discussed in literature , it is generally impossible to disentangle the effects of kinematics and line opacities in observed double - peaked emission lines .",
    "however , we should note that there are some different model expected features of double - peaked narrow emission lines , based on proposed kinematic and non - kinematic models .",
    "on the one hand , the kinematical models should lead to the similar line profiles of double - peaked narrow balmer emission lines , because the kinematic models have the same effects on narrow balmer emission lines . on the other hand , due to much different line opacities for narrow balmer emission lines ,",
    "the non - kinematic model could lead to some different double - peaked narrow balmer emission lines .",
    "however , in the literature , there are so far no reliable results reported on non - kinematic origin of double - peaked narrow emission lines . here , in this letter , we firstly report such a unique object with double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 , which will provide strong evidence to support the non - kinematic model leading to the different line profiles of narrow balmer emission lines . in section 2 , we give our main results and discussions on the object sdss j0832 + 0643 . and",
    "in section 3 , we give our final conclusions .",
    "in order to check properties of broad balmer emission lines of double - peaked narrow line agns , emission lines have been carefully checked for all the double - peaked narrow line objects reported in ge et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which will provide further information on origin of double - peaked narrow emission lines ( zhang 2015 , submitted to mnras ) . when we check shifted velocities of broad balmer lines relative to double - peaked narrow balmer lines , we find sdss j083253.18 + 064316.7 ( = sdss j0832 + 0643 ) with the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 . except the sdss j0832 + 0643",
    ", no other objects can be found with so strange narrow balmer lines .",
    "then , by the following fitted results for narrow balmer emission lines and the following kolmogorov - smirnov statistic results , we can confirm that it is true for double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 .",
    "the observed sdss spectrum is shown in figure  [ spec ] for sdss j0832 + 0643 . in order to show more clearer properties of narrow balmer emission lines ,",
    "the stellar lights in the spectrum should be firstly subtracted . here , the more recent proposed ppxf method ( penalized pixel - fitting method discussed in cappellar & emsellem 2004 ) with 224 miles ( medium resolution int library of empirical spectra , vazdekis et al . 2012 ) template spectra is applied to determine the stellar contributions , because the regularization technique included in the ppxf method could lead to more smoother solutions on spectral decomposition . here ,",
    "the 224 miles template spectra have stellar ages from 0.0631gyr to 17.7828gyr and have [ m / h ] from -2.32 to 0.22 .",
    "the determined stellar contributions by the ppxf method are shown in figure  [ spec ] .",
    "based on the ppxf determined results , the stellar velocity dispersion of host galaxy is about @xmath2 in sdss j0832 + 0643 , which is consistent with the reported value @xmath3 determined by the starlight code ( cid fernandes et al .",
    "2005 ) in ge et al .",
    "the coincident results indicate our determined stellar components are reliable .",
    "then , after stellar lights being removed , emission lines can be well checked .",
    "and we can find that sdss j0832 + 0643 is one type 2 objects with pure narrow emission lines : strong narrow balmer lines and much weak [ o  iii]@xmath4 line .",
    "figure  [ line ] shows the fitted results for narrow emission lines by gaussian functions . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the lines of narrow h@xmath0 , narrow h@xmath1 and [ n  ii]@xmath5 doublet .",
    "the determined line parameters are listed in table 1 . here",
    ", there is one important point we should note . when our procedure is applied to describe each narrow emission line by two gaussian functions , we try to fit the narrow h@xmath1 by the similar line profile of the double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 .",
    "however , we find that fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) is about 510@xmath6 for the narrow h@xmath0 , but is only 270@xmath6 for the narrow h@xmath1 .",
    "the much different fwhms strongly indicate different line profiles of narrow balmer lines . so that the narrow h@xmath1 is fitted without considerations of line profile of double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , although two gaussian components are applied to fit the narrow h@xmath1 in our procedure , the fitted result for narrow h@xmath1 leads to zero flux of one component , which indicates one gaussian function is good enough to describe the narrow h@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov statistic technique is applied to check difference between line profiles of narrow balmer lines .",
    "based on the line profile of narrow h@xmath1 from the observed spectrum with stellar contributions being subtracted and the line profile of narrow h@xmath0 created by the two gaussian components listed in table 1 , the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic gives one probability about 0.0015 to support the assumption that narrow h@xmath0 and narrow h@xmath1 have the similar line profile . and",
    "moreover , based on the line profile of narrow h@xmath1 from the observed spectrum with stellar contributions being subtracted and the fitted result for the narrow h@xmath1 by the one gaussian components listed in table 1 , the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic gives one probability about 83% to support the assumption that the narrow h@xmath1 has one gaussian line profile .",
    "therefore , one gaussian function rather than two gaussian functions is preferred to describe the narrow h@xmath1 .    before proceeding further",
    ", simple comparisons are shown with reported results of double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 in ge et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for sdss j0832 + 0643 . in ge",
    "et al . ( 2012 ) , the reported line parameters of the double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 are as follows : @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the blue component , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the red component respectively .",
    "it is clear that the results on line width and line flux listed in table 1 are well consistent with reported results in ge et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . and moreover , the peak separation is about 5.99@xmath110.26in ge et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which is also well consistent with our result 6@xmath110.26 .",
    "the results indicate our determined line parameters of double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 are reliable .",
    "furthermore , there is one point we should note . in ge et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , when emission lines were determined , there was one strong criterion that each narrow emission line had the similar double - peaked line profile , which led to mathematic determined line parameters of two fake components of narrow [ o  iii]@xmath4 and narrow h@xmath1 of sdss j0832 + 0643 , and then led to classification of one two type 2 agns of sdss j0832 + 0643 . however , it is clear that there are much different line profiles of narrow balmer lines , which indicate the criterion applied in ge et al .",
    "( 2012 ) is not valid for the narrow balmer lines of sdss j0832++0643 .",
    "so that , in this paper , we do not show further discussions on classification of sdss j0832++0643 .",
    "based on the results discussed above , we can find that the narrow h@xmath0 is double - peaked but the narrow h@xmath1 is single - peaked in sdss j0832 + 0643 .",
    "this is so far the only one reported unique object with the double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 . and",
    "moreover , the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 is not corresponding to blue or red component of the double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 , through their determined center wavelengths listed in table 1 .",
    "then , we can check the theoretical models for the particular features of narrow balmer emission lines .",
    ".line parameters [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      + notice : the first column shows which line is measured , the second column shows which component of the line is measured .",
    "the third column shows the center wavelength in unit of   for the component , the fourth column shows the second moment in unit of   for the component and the fifth column shows the flux in unit of @xmath12 of the component .    under the kinematic models for double - peaked narrow emission lines",
    ", there is no way to expect so different line profiles of narrow balmer emission lines .",
    "even , with considerations of uncertainties , we could assume that the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 could be related to the red component of double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 .",
    "it looks that the dual supermassive black holes could be applied to explain the observed features of narrow balmer lines with disappearance of the blue component of the narrow h@xmath1 , if there was much larger dust extinction for the blue components of the intrinsic double - peaked narrow balmer emission lines . under the assumed case with large dust extinction for the blue components",
    ", we would expect the @xmath13 could be not less than 1 ( flux ratio of h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 larger than 10 ) .",
    "however , for the red components of double - peaked narrow balmer lines , the flux ratio of h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 is only 3.05 , one common standard value .",
    "if the dust extinction in the blue component was due to abundant dusts due to galaxy mergering , it is natural to expect that there should be similar effects of mergering on the two components .",
    "if we assume that the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 could be related to the blue component of double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 , similar results can be found : flux ratio of the red components of narrow h@xmath0 to narrow h@xmath1 is larger than 10 , but the flux ratio of the blue component is only 1.9 .",
    "therefore , the dual supermassive black holes could not be one natural choice to explain the observed features of double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 of sdss j0832 + 0643 .",
    "the non - kinematic model can be one natural and reasonable model to explain double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 . based on the measured line flux of total h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 ,",
    "the flux ratio is about 5 , which indicate the optical depths in h@xmath0 and in h@xmath1 are about @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively , with the following assumptions of optical depth of ly@xmath0 about @xmath16 and electron density @xmath17 as discussed in luna & costa ( 2005 ) . here",
    ", we do not have enough information to give one reliable estimation on electron density .",
    "but @xmath18 could be accepted , such as the listed lower limit values of electron densities for southern symbiotic stars in luna & costa ( 2005 ) . and",
    "moreover , the very weak [ o  iii]@xmath4 line support the high electron density to some extent . furthermore , figure  [ image ] shows the sdss image of sdss j0832 + 0643 : one clear mergering system . therefore",
    ", there could be abundant dusts in central region of sdss j0832 + 0643 , which can naturally explain the large flux ratio of narrow h@xmath0 to narrow h@xmath1 .",
    "once , the optical depths in h@xmath0 and in h@xmath1 are simply determined , we can give some discussions on different line profiles of narrow balmer emission lines .",
    "as more recent discussions in elitzur , ramos & ceccarelli ( 2012 ) , optical depth around 10 can be treated as one boundary value : optical depth larger than 10 would lead to double - peaked narrow lines , but optical depth around 1 should not lead to double - peaked narrow lines . in sdss j0832 + 0643 , @xmath19 but @xmath20 could lead to the double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 . furthermore , under the non - kinematic model , the peak separation ( about 270@xmath6 ) of the two peaks of narrow h@xmath0 can be described as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents the broadening velocity due to the thermal motions .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 is enough to create the double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 without contributions from rotating component , which indicates the electron temperature is about @xmath24 .",
    "the expected @xmath22 leads to the expected peak separation of intrinsic double - peaked narrow h@xmath1 is only 120@xmath6 , therefore , it is hard to find apparent double - peaked features of narrow h@xmath1 because of smaller peak separation .",
    "it is clear that the non - kinematic model with considerations of radiative transfer effects can be applied to well explain the observed double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 in sdss j0832 + 0643 .",
    "before the end of the section , there are three points we should note .",
    "first and foremost , the non - kinematic model expected double - peaked narrow emission line could be symmetric to some extent .",
    "however , the observed double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 of sdss j0832 + 0643 is asymmetric to some extent , the red component is more stronger than the blue component .",
    "the asymmetric double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 indicates another weak component included in the narrow emission lines , one probable radial flow component .",
    "if the radial components were removed , the flux ratio of h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 should be a bit larger than 5 , leading to a bit larger @xmath25 leading to more consistent results with the observed features of narrow balmer lines .    besides , it is hard to find the non - kinematic model expected double - peaked narrow emission lines , because much lower electron density in common nlrs leading to flux ratio of narrow h@xmath0 to narrow h@xmath1 around 3 and smaller electron temperate leading to much smaller peak separations of expected double - peaked narrow emission lines .",
    "last but not least , we give further discussions to confirm that the narrow h@xmath0 and the narrow h@xmath1 have much different line profiles . figure  [ line2 ] shows the line profiles of narrow balmer lines , before and after subtractions of stellar contributions .",
    "it is clear that even in the sdss spectrum without subtractions of stellar contributions , there are double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 , but single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 . and",
    "moreover , we have shown that the stellar velocity dispersion is about 155@xmath6 ( about 2.5  around h@xmath1 ) , which is larger than the measured line width of narrow h@xmath1",
    ". therefore , there are few effects of subtractions of stellar contributions on the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 , and the conclusion is reliable that the double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 and the single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 are not fake .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions as follows . first and foremost ,",
    "sdss j0832 + 0643 is so far the firstly reported object with particular features of narrow balmer emission lines : double - peaked narrow h@xmath0 but single - peaked narrow h@xmath1 .",
    "besides , the kinematic models can not explain the observed features of narrow balmer emission lines of sdss j0832 + 0643 .",
    "last but not least , the non - kinematic model with considerations of radiative transfer effects can be applied to well explain the observed features of narrow balmer emission lines of sdss j0832 + 0643 .",
