    "the quest for exotic electronic orderings is driven by our ability to produce said states as clean as possible , in a tunable manner and preferably cheap . organic conductors with reduced dimensionality offer all of these desirable properties and are rightly in the very focus of solid - state physicists searching for new phenomena .",
    "the origin of their extremely rich phase diagrams lies in the competition between the tendency of electrons to delocalize and the pronounced interactions between charge , spin and lattice .",

    "the phase diagram of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 features a number of intriguing quantum effects : at ambient pressure it undergoes a metal - to - insulator transition into a charge - ordered ( co ) state with co - induced ferroelectricity@xcite where it shows ferroelectric hysteresis,@xcite nonlinear ultrafast optical response,@xcite and photo - induced phase transition,@xcite it features zero - gap semiconductivity with massless dirac - like fermions,@xcite and becomes superconducting under uniaxial pressure.@xcite    at ambient pressure and high temperatures the system exhibits metallic character .",

    "structural x - ray diffraction finds no superlattice reflections , meaning the lattice is not modulated and no peierls - like electron - lattice coupling is responsible for the co. however , a reduction of symmetry at @xmath5 from p@xmath13 to p1 does take place.@xcite it corresponds to a loss of inversion centers between molecules in stack i , the so - called molecules a and a@xmath14 , which allows for two domain types within the charge order .",
    "the co in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 is of a pronounced ferroelectric character.@xcite according to structural analysis , the crystal shows monotonic lattice shrinkage without substantial displacement of molecules with lowering temperature , suggesting that structural modulation makes only a minor contribution to the electric polarization .",
    "therefore the polarization was attributed mainly to the modulation of the electron distribution caused by co.@xcite below the co transition an anisotropic dielectric relaxation in the radio - frequency range is observed.@xcite within molecular planes , the dielectric spectra show a marked dispersion with two discernible contributions : the stronger one changes with temperature similarly to phason excitations in charge- and spin - density waves , whereas the smaller mode is temperature - independent and reminiscent of a soliton - like behavior.@xcite these features were used to describe the co in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 as a cooperative bond - charge density wave with ferroelectric - like nature where both short - wavelength domain - wall excitations and long - wavelength phason - like excitations are present.@xcite .",

    "conductivity , hall coefficient and magnetoresistance of a two - carrier system are generally given by convoluted expressions which contain four unknown quantities , mobilities of electrons @xmath66 , holes @xmath67 , as well as their densities @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "those expressions can be significantly simplified if we assume the stoichiometric compound , i.e.  if the material may be considered sufficiently clean so the self - doping is not pronounced , with equal densities of electrons and holes @xmath70:@xcite @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 although expressions ( [ eq : conductivity ] ) , ( [ eq : rh ] ) and ( [ eq : mr ] ) are derived for isotropic bands , they can be used to describe a quasi-2d system .",
    "namely , in our measurements the magnetic field is parallel to @xmath38-axis and as such forces charge carriers to move in the @xmath16 plane where transport at high temperatures is almost isotropic ( see figure [ fig : resistivity ] ) .",
    "thus , from the conductivity , hall effect , and magnetoresistance data one can in principle determine the mobilities and densities of the charge carriers and separate conductivity contributions coming from electrons and holes .",
    "such an analysis previously explained unusual transport properties of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 at high pressures.@xcite    in nice agreement with equation ( [ eq : rh ] ) , @xmath26 does not depend on the magnetic field @xmath19 , i.e.  hall resistance is linear with respect to magnetic field ( see inset of figure [ fig : hall ] ) . at the same time , equation ( [ eq : mr ] ) gives @xmath74 which holds up to 2 t , a sizable range if we consider the elevated temperatures .",
    "taking the magnetoresistance data up to 2 t we can then obtain a rough estimate of charge carrier mobilities and densities .    above @xmath5",
    "we obtain charge carrier densities @xmath75 , a value which does not depend on temperature and is three orders of magnitude smaller than calculated for a quarter - filled band as in the above text .",
    "such a low density of carriers is in accord with distinctly small electron and hole pockets at the fermi level instead of a metal - like , large fermi surface .",
    "the carrier mobilities turn out to be almost the same and around 200@xmath76/vs which is at least two orders of magnitude larger than typical values in organic conductors@xcite and much closer to values found in other semimetals.@xcite note that within the limitations of our model the @xmath77 is due to @xmath78 where the difference in mobilities is significantly below 1% .",
    "thus , the analysis of magnetotransport data shows that above @xmath79 @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 is a system with high mobility and low density of charge carriers and gives a strong experimental confirmation of the semimetallic phase .",
    "it is a puzzling contradiction that small electron and hole pockets result in a hall coefficient close to the one expected from a quarter - filled band . according to equation ( [ eq : rh ] )",
    ", the electron and hole contributions partially cancel each other out and therefore the effective @xmath26 can end up much smaller than expected from carrier density alone .",
    "the same densities and mobilities of electrons and holes would require a complete compensation in @xmath26 .",
    "the situation is very similar to 1t - tise@xmath80 , @xcite another layered material with charge order where the compensation of electron and hole contributions greatly reduces @xmath26 above the charge - ordering transition .",
    "the very close values of mobilities for electrons and holes in both compounds indicate a very specific scattering process .    previous work on the electronic structure of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 in the high - temperature phase agrees on two bands barely crossing the fermi level at different points in the brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite the high - temperature phase with one band almost full and the other almost empty ( valence and conduction band , respectively ) puts @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 squarely among the indirect - gap semimetals .",
    "the corresponding fermi surface consists of small electron and hole pockets .",
    "the respective concentrations of charge carriers are equal in the stoichiometric compound and much smaller than what is obtained within a simple picture of quarter - filled bands .",
    "the mobilities obtained from our measurements are large compared to other organic conductors , so let us attempt a microscopic explanation .",
    "energy and momentum conservation allows only scattering processes that move carriers inside the corresponding pocket ( intra - pocket scattering ) and the ones that transfer carriers between the two pockets ( inter - pocket scattering ) .",
    "considering the size of pockets , this restriction strongly reduces electron - phonon scattering which results in large relaxation times and consequently high mobilities of the charge carriers .",
    "the relative strength of intra- and inter - pocket scattering depends on the electron - phonon couplings for all the phonon branches involved . without detailed calculations it is hard to argue which of the two scattering processes",
    ", if any , is dominant .",
    "however , the inter - pocket scattering should be particularly favorable in indirect - gap semimetals , as the energies involved are low ( quasi - elastic on the electrons scale ) , whereas the momentum transfer is always large . in this way impurities as well as phonon bands both contribute to scattering processes that are efficient in reducing electric current .",
    "the inter - pocket scattering has a particular property which conspires to equalize the mobilities of carriers in the two pockets .",
    "namely , the carriers in the hole pocket are scattered into the electron pocket , and vice versa . in both cases",
    "the scattering rates are determined by the density of final states .",
    "therefore , the scattering rate of holes is proportional to the electron band mass @xmath81 , and vice versa the scattering rate of electrons is proportional to the hole band mass @xmath82 ( @xmath83 denotes the relevant electron - phonon coupling for the inter - pocket scattering ) .",
    "this leads to the hole mobility being same as the electron mobility , @xmath84 assuming other scattering channels being negligible ( the proportionality factors @xmath85 and @xmath86 contain some less interesting factors and are introduced for convenience ) .",
    "this scenario is consistent with our analysis of magnetotransport properties in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 for @xmath49 which showed that the electron and hole mobilities not only have high values but also coincide to a great precision .",
    "the vanishing difference in the mobilities of electron and holes suggests that intra - pocket scattering is indeed very small in comparison to the contribution of the inter - pocket scattering .",
    "as the carrier densities remain constant , the change of conductivity above @xmath5 is accounted for solely by the change of mobilities .",
    "however , in the low - temperature phase a complete analysis can not be performed because a negative magnetoresistance is not taken into account by the equation ( [ eq : mr ] ) . at the co phase transition",
    "@xmath26 changes sign ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : magnetoresistance ] ) .",
    "a negative magnetoresistance is rare in non - magnetic materials and usually has an exotic origin : in organics it has been ascribed to band splitting which induces a small increase of charge carrier density,@xcite 2d weak localization due to disorder in the anion lattice,@xcite or to reduced scattering on antiferromagnetic fluctuations.@xcite negative magnetoresistance is also observed in the impurity conduction of many semiconductors.@xcite thus , apart from being just one of the indications of the co phase transition we can take the negative magnetoresistance in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 as a signal for presence of disorder .",
    "indeed , we shall see in the following that the influence of disorder is also present in dc transport in the form of hopping contribution , as well as in the relaxor - like dielectric response .",
    "the resistivity curves in the insulating charge - ordered state all show a temperature - dependent slope in the arrhenius plot ( fig .  [",
    "fig : resistivity ] ) . evidently , a simple activation law @xmath87 with a temperature - independent activation energy @xmath88 is not appropriate .",
    "further , in potentially disordered systems one option is to consider a variable range hopping mechanism.@xcite however , following the procedure outlined by joung _",
    "et al._,@xcite we find it does not describe well any of the three measured directions .",
    "let us instead consider an activated transport mechanism with a general , temperature - dependent activation energy @xmath89 which is then simple to extract from experimental data : @xmath90 if the constant @xmath91 is set in such a way that the activation energy @xmath88 vanishes at @xmath5 , we obtain the temperature dependence of activation energy shown by figure [ fig : resistivity_correction ] ( inset ) for @xmath92 .",

    "seeing that variable - range hopping is ruled out , we ascribe the low temperature conductivity mechanism in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 to a nearest - neighbor hopping ( nnh ) .",
    "the nnh channel requires randomly distributed , localized states of a certain density which implies a level of disorder present in all our measured samples .",

    "one would expect transport to happen across the smallest available gap at a given temperature .",
    "having the optical , direct gap smaller than the transport gap points to a possible issue in determining these gaps .",
    "close to the optical gap there are phonon features ( around 800@xmath101 and 1300@xmath101 ) that impede its reliable determination , so its actual value may lie somewhat higher .",
    "further , the effective dc transport gap ( double the activation energy in the inset of fig .",

    "this brings the apparent disagreement between the mean - field - like order parameter and the optical gap closer to resolution . according to dft calculations@xcite",
    "the smallest energy difference between the valence and conduction band needs to be indirect .",
    "therefore , we can associate our transport gap with an indirect transition and the optical gap with a direct transition near the dirac - like point .",
    "the energy gap follows a mean - field behavior , but the ratio @xmath102 is far from 3.5 expected from the conventional bcs mean - field theory .",
    "similarly high values of @xmath103 were observed in low - dimensional systems and ascribed to one of the following : suppression of the mean - field transition temperature @xmath104 by strong coupling interactions,@xcite imperfect nesting,@xcite or fluctuations pronounced in low - dimensional systems.@xcite here the latter seems most relevant as fluctuating charge is observed in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 already at room temperature.@xcite according to kupi _",

    "moreover we can associate this disorder with the unusual properties found by infrared electronic conductivity,@xcite namely the in - plane non - zero optical conductivity within the gap area and its gradual evolution with cooling even to the lowest temperatures .    in the end",
    "let us address the origin of the dielectric relaxation in the co phase of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 . from optical second harmonic generation",
    "it is known that the metal - to - insulator phase transition is evidently of ferroelectric character , long - range and three - dimensional . in a long - range ferroelectric system a frequency - independent curie - like peak is expected , such as in the well - established co - driven ferroelectric ( tmttf)@xmath1asf@xmath107.@xcite however , in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 only at lower temperatures , below about 100k , does a wide , dispersive @xmath62 appear both in - plane and out - of - plane . in disordered systems , a relaxor - like response would commonly be taken as evidence of glassy physics with freezing , short - range , polar entities.@xcite one signature of such a response is the broad distribution of mean relaxation times , commonly described by the value @xmath108 , which approaches 0.3 close to the freezing temperature .",
    "this type of process is observed in the related @xmath109-(bedt - ttf)@xmath110 systems where no long - range charge ordering is found.@xcite for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 , an interpretation of this kind@xcite would be in contradiction with the long - range order .",
    "we offer here a revised picture for the dielectric response which reconciles disparate interpretations .",
    "the ferroelectricity of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 comes from the charge - rich and charge - poor molecules a and a@xmath14 with broken inversion symmetry.@xcite coincidentally , these two molecular sites also have the most hydrogen bonds with i@xmath3 anions.@xcite it is therefore plausible that the i@xmath3 disorder@xcite will strongly manifest itself within the response of the bulk polarization , meaning the large peak in @xmath111 directly stems from the bulk . with this in mind",
    "we propose that the apparent relaxor - like behavior observed both in - plane and out - of - plane is effectively a `` renormalized '' curie response associated with the co transition and the bulk polarization : in the presence of disorder it is being pushed to temperatures well below @xmath5 and becomes dispersive . now",
    ", the dispersion is determined by free carrier screening , since the mean dielectric relaxation time follows the same temperature dependence as dc resistivity.@xcite further , the distribution width of dielectric relaxation times extracted from frequency domain experiments is @xmath1120.8,@xcite too narrow for a disordered , glassy system with freezing relaxor response . in the presence of disorder , dielectric response with such a width and screening",
    "is a well - known fingerprint of incommensurate density waves.@xcite we posit that in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 the intrinsic anion disorder plays a role analogous to screened pinning on the incommensurate potential in density waves .",
    "lastly , since this interpretation leaves the long - range ferroelectric ordering in place , we associate the remaining smaller dielectric contribution with domain wall motion .",
    "in this work we address the nature of charge transport and charge ordering in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 . in the high - temperature semimetallic phase , transport is governed by large mobilities of electrons and holes .",
    "the value of the hall coefficient for this semimetal unexpectedly corresponds to that of a quarter - filled band , and we explain this surprising feature as a consequence of a predominantly inter - pocket scattering which equalizes mobilities of the two types of charge carriers . at low temperatures the dc transport points toward two separate channels of conduction : a nearest - neighbor hopping contribution and an activated contribution with a mean - field , distinctly isotropic order parameter .",
    "in dielectric response , the ferroelectric nature of the charge - ordered phase is announced by an anisotropic , dispersion stemming from the bulk response , without any sign of freezing of dielectric moments .",
    "our measurements indicate that the intrinsic anion disorder influences ac and dc transport in the molecular conducting layers through hydrogen bonds with bedt - ttf molecules .",
