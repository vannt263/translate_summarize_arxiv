    "the constituent quark model provides a rather successful descrition of the spectrum of the mesons in terms of quark - antiquark bound states , which fit into the suitable multiplets reasonably well .",
    "therefore , it is understandable that the recent observations of the very narrow resonances @xmath5 by babar @xcite , @xmath6 by cleo @xcite , @xmath2 by belle @xcite , and the very broad scalar meson @xmath1 by belle @xcite , all of them with masses below quark model predictions , have stimulated a renewed interest in the spectroscopy of open charm and charmonium states . the difficulties to identify the mesons @xmath5 and @xmath6 as @xmath4 states are rather similar to those appearing in the light scalar mesons below 1 gev ( the isoscalars @xmath7 , the isodublet @xmath8 and the isovector @xmath9 ) , that can be interpreted as four - quark states @xcite . in the case of @xmath2 , besides its small mass , the observation , reported by the belle collaboration @xcite , that the @xmath10 decays to @xmath11 , with a strength that is compatible to that of the @xmath12 mode : = 1.00.40.3 , [ data ] establishes strong isospin violating effects , which can not be explained if the @xmath2 is interpreted as a @xmath13 state .",
    "due to these facts , these new mesons were considered as good candidates for four - quark states by many authors @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the method of qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) @xcite was used to study the two - point functions for the mesons @xmath5 , @xmath1and @xmath2 considered as four - quark states in a diquark - antidiquark configuration .",
    "the results obtained for their masses are compatible with the experimental values and , therefore , in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors concluded that it is possible to reproduce the experimental value of the masses using a four - quark representation for these states .",
    "concerning their decay widths , the study of the three - point functions related to the decay widths @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , using the diquark - antidiquark configuration for @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath10 , was done in refs .",
    "the results obtained for their partial decay widths are given in table i , from where we see that the partial decay widths obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , supposing that the mesons @xmath5 and @xmath18 are four - quark states , are consistent with the experimental upper information for the total decay width .",
    ".numerical results for the resonance decay widths [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    however , in the case of the meson @xmath2 , the partial decay width obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is much bigger than the experimental upper limit to the total width .    in ref .",
    "@xcite some arguments were presented to reduce the value of the @xmath2 decay width , by imposing that the initial four - quark state needs to have a non - trivial color structure . in this case",
    ", its partial decay width can be reduced to @xmath19 . however , that procedure may appear somewhat unjustified and , therefore , more study is needed until one can arrive at a definitive conclusion about the structure of the meson @xmath2 .",
    "concerning the meson @xmath5 , although its mass and decay width can be explained in a four - quark scenario , they can also be reproduced in other approaches @xcite , and it is not yet possible to discriminate between the different structures proposed for this state .",
    "therefore , it is important to find experimental observations that could be used to descriminate between the different quark structure of these mesons . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a signal could be obtained by the analysis of certain heavy - ion collision observables .",
    "in particular , the meson @xmath5 can be produced in reactions induced by photons on kaon targets in a nuclear medium formed in a heavy - ion collision .",
    "therefore , if the coupling constant , @xmath3 , is found to be very different depending on the structure for @xmath5 , then the photo - production of @xmath5 can be used as a signal to descriminate its structure .",
    "the coupling , @xmath3 , supposing that the meson @xmath5 is a conventional @xmath4 state , was evaluated in ref .",
    "they got : g_d_sjdk=(9.20.5 )  [ gww ] here , we extend the calculation done in refs .",
    "@xcite to study the hadronic vertex @xmath20 .",
    "the qcdsr calculation for the vertex , @xmath21 , centers around the three - point function given by    t_(p,,q)=d^4x d^4y  e^i.x  e^iq.y 0 |t[j_d(x)j_5(y)j^_d_sj(0)]|0 , where @xmath22 is the interpolating field for the scalar @xmath17 meson @xcite : j_d_sj=_abc_dec , [ int ] where @xmath23 are colour indices and @xmath24 is the charge conjugation matrix . in eq .",
    "( [ 3po ] ) , @xmath25 and the interpolating fields for the kaon and for the @xmath26 mesons are given by : j_5=|s_a__5q_a , j_d = i|q_a_5c_a , where @xmath27 stands for the light quark @xmath28 or @xmath29 .    the calculation of the phenomenological side proceeds by inserting intermediate states for @xmath26 , @xmath30 and @xmath17 , and by using the definitions : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "we obtain the following relation : t_^phen ( p,,q)&=&m_d^2f_df_k   g_d_sjdk / m_c ( p^2-m_d_sj^2)(^2-m_d^2)(q^2-m_k^2 )   q _ + & + & , where the coupling constant , @xmath3 , is defined by the on - mass - shell matrix element : @xmath34 . the continuum contribution in eq.([phen ] ) contains the contributions of all possible excited states .    in the case of the light scalar mesons ,",
    "considered as diquark - antidiquark states , the study of their vertices functions using the qcd sum rule approach at the pion pole @xcite , was done in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the decay widths determined from the qcd sum rule calculation are consistent with existing experimental data . here ,",
    "we follow ref .  @xcite and work at the kaon pole .",
    "the main reason for working at the kaon pole is that one does not have to deal with the complications associated with the extrapolation of the form factor @xcite .",
    "the kaon pole method consists in neglecting the kaon mass in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ phen ] ) and working at @xmath35 . in the ope side one",
    "singles out the leading terms in the operator product expansion of eq.([3po ] ) that match the @xmath36 term .",
    "since we are working at @xmath35 , we take the limit @xmath37 and we apply a single borel transformation to @xmath38 . in the phenomenological side , in the structure",
    "@xmath39 we get : t^phen(m^2)&= & m_d^2f_df_k   g_d_sjdkm_c(m_d_sj^2-m_d^2 ) ( e^-m_d^2/m^2 -e^-m_d_sj^2/m^2 ) + & + & a  e^-s_0/m^2 + _ u_0^_cc(u )  e^-u / m^2du , [ paco ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 stands for the pole - continuum transitions and pure continuum contributions , with @xmath42 and @xmath43 being the continuum thresholds for @xmath17 and @xmath26 respectively @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", one assumes that the pure continuum contribution to the spectral density , @xmath41 , is given by the result obtained in the ope side .",
    "therefore , one uses the ansatz : @xmath44 . in eq.([paco ] ) , @xmath40 is a parameter which , together with @xmath3 , has to be determined by the sum rule .    in the ope side we single out the leading terms proportional to @xmath45 . transferring the pure continuum contribution to the ope side , the sum rule for the coupling constant , up to dimension 7 ,",
    "is given by : & & c  ( e^-m_d^2/m^2 -e^-m_d_sj^2/m^2)+a  e^-s_0/m^2= + & = & 1 , [ sr ] with c = m_d^2f_df_k m_c(m_d_sj^2-m_d^2 )  g_d_sjdk .",
    "in the numerical analysis of the sum rules , the values used for the meson masses , quark masses and condensates are : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 , @xmath51 . for the meson decay constants we use @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath54 and for the current meson coupling , @xmath55 , we are going to use the result obtained from the two - point function in ref .",
    "considering @xmath56 we get @xmath57 .      in fig .",
    "1 we show , through the dots , the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq.([sr ] ) as a function of the borel mass . to determine @xmath3 we fit the qcdsr results with the analytical expression in the left - hand side ( lhs ) of eq.([sr ] ) : c ( e^-m_d_s^2/m^2 -e^-m_d_sj^2/m^2)+a  e^-s_0/m^2 , [ exp ] using @xmath58 we get : @xmath59 and @xmath60 . using the definition of @xmath24 in eq.([coef ] ) and @xmath61 ( the value obtained for @xmath62 ) we get @xmath63 . allowing @xmath42 to vary in the interval @xmath56 , the corresponding variation obtained for the coupling constant is 2.5  g_d_sjdk3.8  .",
    "[ g ]    fixing @xmath58 and varying the quark condensate , the charm quark and the strange quark masses in the intervals : @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we get results for the coupling constant still between the lower and upper limits given above .",
    "it is important to mention that the agreement between the rhs and lhs of the sum rule in fig.1 is not so good , in this case , as it was in the case of the couplings @xmath67 and @xmath68 evaluated in refs .",
    "one possible reason for that is the fact that the kaon mass is much bigger than the pion mass .",
    "therefore , neglecting the kaon mass in eq .",
    "( [ phen ] ) is not an approximation as good as it is in the case of the sum rule in the pion pole .",
    "we have presented a qcd sum rule study of the vertex function associated with the hadronic vertex @xmath21 , where the @xmath69 meson was considered as diquark - antidiquark state .",
    "comparing the results in eqs .",
    "( [ g ] ) and ( [ gww ] ) we see that when the meson @xmath69 is considered as a conventional @xmath4 state one gets a @xmath3 coupling constant much bigger than when @xmath69 is considered a four - quark state .",
    "this result can be usefull to experimentally investigate the quark structure of the meson @xmath69 through its photon production in a nuclear medium .",
