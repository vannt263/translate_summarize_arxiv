    "two - dimensional supramolecular structures with a planar honeycomb ( hon ) pattern on metal surfaces are very often encountered in molecular assemblies  @xcite .",
    "such systems are composed of triangular- or mixed triangular and rectangular - shaped organic molecules connected by hydrogen bonds .",
    "ordered hon formations are obtained in triangular - molecule - assemblies of trimesic acid ( tma )  @xcite , btb  @xcite , 1,3,5-tris(pyridine-4-ylethynyl)benzene  @xcite , melamine  @xcite , etc .",
    "sometimes the triangular molecules are used as nodes , while pctdi  @xcite , ntcdi  @xcite , ditopic imidic linkers  @xcite or some other rectangular - shaped molecules form hexagon sides during the assembly of the hon structure .",
    "theoretical studies of the stability of certain structures , the adsorption energies , the most probable ocupation sites or the interaction parameters of h - bonded molecular structures are usually performed by the density functional theory methods  @xcite . to obtain density - temperature phase diagrams or predict new ordering motifs ,",
    "the statistical models of phase transitions might also be used  @xcite as an alternative or a supporting simulation .",
    "since the triangular molecules are symmetric and their layout is planar , they possess a three - fold symmetry with respect to @xmath1 rotation .",
    "thus , the hon phase ( fig .",
    "1a ) , organized by triangular molecules , h - bonded by their vertices ( tip - to - tip bonding ) on the triangular lattice , might be considered as the three - state system .",
    "if the `` leg '' of the molecule is superposed with the direction of the lattice vector , there are just two molecular states , which differ by 60 degrees rotation , and the vacancy state .",
    "for such a definition of the states , the hon phase corresponds to a phase on a tripartite lattice with the sites of each sublattice occupied by different occupation variables ( e. g. + 1 , @xmath2 , and 0 ) .",
    "this phase is a popular ground state structure of well - known three - state models : the potts model  @xcite , the blume - capel ( bc ) model  @xcite and the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model  @xcite .",
    "the hon phase is obtained in these models for the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) nearest - neighbor interaction and the certain range of a single - ion anisotropy parameter which corresponds to a chemical potential , if the lattice - gas formalism is used ( e.g. in case of molecular ordering ) . in a limiting range of the hon phase existence ( for low values of chemical potential or high molecular concentrations ) , the centers of honeycombs are to be filled and the three - state model might be related to the triangular afm ising ( tafi ) model , characterized by  @xcite the frustrated phase and finite entropy at zero temperature .",
    "nevertheless , for a description of the tip - to - tip ordering of triangular ( e.g. tma  @xcite ) molecules , the mentioned three - state models are unsuitable .",
    "the afm potts model can not be used , since it takes into account a non - zero contribution to the energy of interacting non - equivalent states . obviously , the interaction of a vacancy with a molecule in any of the two non - zero molecular states ( @xmath3 ) has to be neglected .",
    "the afm bc model is inappropriate , because only one of the two afm interactions ( tip - to - tip ( fig .",
    "1b ) and side - to - side ( fig .",
    "1c ) ) has to be considered in a tip - to - tip ordering scheme , while the afm bc model ( as well as more general afm beg model ) does not segregate between them accounting both as the same interaction .",
    "moreover , the ferromagnetic ( fm ) interaction of two molecules in the same state , instead of giving no contribution to the energy ( no h - bond ) , increases the energy .    ) , ( c ) side - to - side interaction ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the c , o and h atoms of tma molecule are shown by black , red and white circles , respectively . in ( b ) and ( c ) the sites of sublattices a , b and c are shown by gray , pink and open dots , respectively . ]",
    "there is one statistical lattice model which perfectly fits for a description of the ordering of planar triangular molecules .",
    "the model was proposed  @xcite in 1970 by bell and lavis ( bl ) to consider a two - dimensional bonded fluid .",
    "this model emphasizes the orientational property of the hydrogen bond on the triangular lattice , and therefore is often considered  @xcite as a lattice version of the mercedez - benz models  @xcite . according to the bl model , the h - bonded pair of molecules is created , if the bonding directions of two nearest - neighbor ( nn ) molecules point towards each other . otherwise , there is just van der waals interaction between the nn molecules . at lower temperature ,",
    "the phase transition ( `` long - range sublattice order '' ) occurs in the bl model between a disordered `` liquid '' and a `` solid '' or `` ice '' phase . from a magnetic point of view",
    "the bl model is clearly antiferromagnetic , since the h - bond occurs only when two molecules are in different states ( molecular orientations ) .",
    "thus , the mentioned phase transition is between the disordered paramagnetic ( pm ) and the hon phases .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the bl model were studied in some detail using mean - field  @xcite , renormalization group  @xcite , cluster variation  @xcite , recursive approach to the bethe lattice  @xcite and monte carlo  @xcite methods .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the bl model can be mapped into the afm beg model if an anisotropic interaction is added to the beg model hamiltonian .",
    "thus , though the properties and resulting phase diagrams might have some similarities , there are some important differences between the beg and bl models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail ) .",
    "at least two important problems of the bl model were not thoroughly studied in previous papers . the first deals with a recent finding  @xcite of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt)-type phase between the disordered and long - range ordered ( hon ) phase in the afm bc model . this frustrated phase does not cease to exist even in the afm bc model with exclusions  @xcite . in absence of van der waals interactions , the bl model has the same edges of the single ion anisotropy ( chemical potential ) for the hon phase existence as the afm bc model . with an increase of molecular density ,",
    "both bl and afm bc models approach the two - state ( tafi ) model limit .",
    "moreover , the two peaks are observed in the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the bl model at higher molecular densities - the same finding as for the afm bc model .",
    "the question then arises : how similar are the phase transitions of those two models ?",
    "do the peaks of the specific heat frame the planar phase or their origin is different ?    it should be noted , that the relation between the frustrated phase of the tafi model and the planar - type of ordering is well - known .",
    "the magnetic field ( chemical potential ) breaks the ground state degeneracy of the tafi model and stimulates the occurrence of the @xmath5 structure at low values of temperature  @xcite .",
    "the system splits into three sublattices with ferrimagnetic spin magnetizations @xmath6 ( a , b and c are the three sublattices of the triangular lattice ) .",
    "the phase transition to this phase is shown  @xcite to belong to the three - state potts universality class .",
    "the mapping of the tafi model in a field to the solid - on - solid model  @xcite leads to a prediction of the bkt phase transition point  @xcite at @xmath7 .    with added",
    "next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) fm interaction , both the three - state afm potts model  @xcite and the tafi model  @xcite are known to have bkt - type phase transitions in the same universality class as the six - state clock model  @xcite . under simple transformation",
    "the six - state clock model is mapped to the tafi model  @xcite .",
    "the six - state model can exhibit either a first - order transition , two bkt - type transitions , or successive ising , three - state potts , or ashkin - teller - type transitions  @xcite .",
    "the competition of the nn afm interactions and nnn fm interactions in the tafi model leads to a two - peaked temperature dependence of a specific heat  @xcite framing the planar phase in a similar manner as for the @xmath8-state clock models  @xcite .",
    "the second unsolved problem of the bl model is related to the order and the universality class of the phase transition from the disordered to the hon phase .",
    "the previous results are rather controversial .",
    "the first - order phase transition was initially obtained  @xcite using a mean - field approximation .",
    "later , the calculation based on the renormalization group approach for partial bl model had predicted  @xcite the transition being in the fm rather than the afm three - state potts universality class  @xcite ( note , that a ( weak ) first order phase transition was later determined  @xcite for the three - state afm potts model ) .",
    "the authors  @xcite of this prediction even assumed that the second - order phase transition found in their work might be a consequence of the low dimensionality of the bl model . in refs .",
    "@xcite the bl model was solved by the cluster variation method and a weak first - order phase transition was again obtained .",
    "later fiore et al  @xcite performed monte carlo ( mc ) calculations and attributed the transition to the ising universality class , claiming that the first order phase transition obtained in previous papers was the artifact arising due to the bethe - like ( cluster ) methods used for calculation .",
    "here we thoroughly study these two problems using mc simulation and finite size scaling .",
    "we found that despite many similarities ( same ground state hon structure ; same limits of the hon phase and proximity of the frustrated phase edge ) the bkt - type planar phase does not occur in the bl model .",
    "the low temperature peak of the specific heat is shown to be caused by the schottky anomaly .",
    "the obtained critical exponents clearly demonstrate that the transition to the hon phase belongs to the three - state potts universality class .",
    "the bl model is based on the assumption that each molecule has three bonding directions at @xmath1 angle to each other .",
    "the molecule has three states : two orientational states and a vacancy state . in each of orientational states",
    "the molecule has bonding directions pointing towards three of the six nn sites of the triangular lattice .",
    "the h - bond is formed if two nn molecules point towards each other .",
    "the interaction energy of a pair of molecules at nn sites is @xmath9 and @xmath4 for h - bonded and h - unbonded pair , respectively , and the subscripts h and vdw denote h - bond and van der waals interactions , respectively ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    several alternative representations of the bl model hamiltonian are known .",
    "the spin-1 variables and mapping scheme to the beg model were suggested by young and lavis  @xcite .",
    "this scheme was later employed by barbosa et al  @xcite who used convenient lattice - gas variables to separately describe occupational and orientational ordering ( see , also  @xcite ) . in ref .  @xcite the description in terms of bond vectors and corresponding energy functionals was used .",
    "gorbunov et al  @xcite employed kronecker variables to express the hamiltonian of the bl model . here",
    "we use the lattice - gas hamiltonian suggested by barbosa et al  @xcite in a form    @xmath10    where the occupation variable @xmath11 is 1 if the site @xmath12 is filled by the molecule and 0 if the site is empty .",
    "this variable is related as @xmath13 to the spin-1 model variable ( @xmath14 and 0 ) further used to characterize the order parameter .",
    "another variable @xmath15 is responsible for the orientational ordering : it corresponds to presence ( @xmath16 ) or absence ( @xmath17 ) of the h - bonding in the direction from site @xmath12 to site @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath0 stands for the chemical potential which we write here with a plus sign as in the beg model .",
    "the first sum is performed over all pairs of nearest neighbors @xmath12 and @xmath18 .",
    "further , the temperature , chemical potential , and van der waals interaction are normalized to h - bond interaction , @xmath19 : @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the mc simulation was performed using metropolis algorithm and glauber dynamics , i.e. the calculations were carried out with fixed chemical potential @xmath0 and varying molecular coverage .",
    "single - flip algorithm was chosen , because of a poor performance  @xcite of traditional cluster algorithms when applied to frustrated systems .",
    "to check , if the simple single - flip technique is appropriate to study such partly frustrated systems as the bl model at @xmath23 , we also performed some calculations using wang - landau sampling  @xcite which is considered more reliable to address the frustrated systems .",
    "the test calculations of specific heat temperature dependence at @xmath24 demonstrated a perfect agreement between the single - flip and wang - landau methods .",
    "we used the triangular lattices with periodic boundary conditions of sizes @xmath25 with @xmath26 and 144 for thermal averaging mc calculations and finite size scaling .",
    "we discarded @xmath27 mc steps ( mcs ) for thermalization and collected averages of @xmath28 mcs ( for the edges of the hon phase existence we used to take up to @xmath29 mcs ) .",
    "our simulations were performed starting from higher temperature in the pm phase and using random initial particle configuration .",
    "then the temperature was gradually decreased in small steps with simulations at a new temperature starting from the final configuration of the previous temperature .",
    "we estimated the thermalization period by observing the time evolution of the order parameters and energy at different temperatures . before gathering statistics for thermal averaging",
    ", we also made additional checks at multiple temperatures near phase transition points to be sure that the sample is in the equilibrium .",
    "the thermalization time did not exceed @xmath30 mcs for lattice size @xmath31 .    in order to estimate statistical errors",
    ", we used the data from @xmath32 independent simulation runs starting from different initial states .",
    "the observation @xmath33 of each run was used to obtain a mean value @xmath34 at that particular temperature .",
    "the error bar of @xmath34 can be obtained from @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in figs",
    "the errors roughly correspond to the size of a data point symbol .    to find the phase transition order and detail the thermal averaging results , we also performed energy and magnetization histogram calculations using single - histogram reweighting technique  @xcite .",
    "for these calculations we used larger lattice sizes ( up to @xmath37 ) than for the thermal averaging and collected entries from @xmath38 mcs for each histogram . in our simulations of thermodynamic parameters the phase transition point was first located by the thermal averaging and then recalculated by the histogram method .",
    "the results were considered reliable if the data obtained by both methods matched .",
    "we also performed the analysis of the autocorrelation time of energy at @xmath39 and some values of @xmath0 .",
    "the integrated autocorrelation time ranges from @xmath40 mcs at @xmath41 ( @xmath31 ) to @xmath42 mcs at the first - order phase transitions close to the gas phase , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we used two afm order parameters to study the pm - to - hon phase transition properties .",
    "one of them was the staggered magnetization ( average difference of sublattice occupancy by non - zero variables ) suggested for studies of the hon phase in the afm bc model  @xcite    @xmath45    here a , b and c correspond to three sublattices of the triangular lattice .",
    "for some calculations we also used another order parameter which was simply the difference @xmath46 where @xmath47 means the sublattice occupancy by dominating non - zero ( either + 1 or @xmath2 ) variable and @xmath48 - the sublattice occupancy by dominating zero variable .",
    "we calculated temperature dependences of the specific heat @xmath49 , susceptibility @xmath50 , logarithmic derivatives of @xmath51 and @xmath52    @xmath53    and binder order parameter and energy cumulants , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . here",

    "close to the second order phase transition point @xmath39 and for sufficiently large @xmath58 , the order parameter , susceptibility and specific heat can be expressed by the scaling functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 in a following way    @xmath62    where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the critical exponents of specific heat , magnetization , susceptibility and correlation length , respectively , and @xmath67 is the background contribution to the specific heat .",

    "the low - temperature peak is due to the schottky anomaly .",

    "the third sublattice is partly occupied by molecules at @xmath113 , but it gradually empties with a decrease of temperature ( see fig . 3a and series of snapshots in fig .",

    "the data used was obtained from both thermal averaging and histograms reweighting .",
    "the values of critical exponents of model ( 1 ) for different values of @xmath0 are presented in a table i. we have found that the transition has to be attributed to the three - state fm potts universality class in a whole range of @xmath0 values , except for the boundaries of the hon phase .        our conclusion is mostly based on values of @xmath72 and @xmath132 , because the difference between the 3-state potts ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146  @xcite ) and ising ( @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) values for other ratios of critical exponents is of the order of the calculation error ( cf @xmath151 and 1.75 in potts and ising universality class , respectively ) .",
    "the scaling of the @xmath68 maximum gives the value of the exponents ratio @xmath72 either equal ( see fig .",
    "8a ) or rather close to the potts value , 0.4 .",
    "the finite size scaling of @xmath68 using formula ( 5 ) gives the exponent @xmath63 close to 1/3 in the range @xmath152 ( see table i ) , i.e. almost up to the top of phase diagram in fig .",
    "no tendency towards the ising value , @xmath153 , is noticed in this range .",

    "8a ) : the susceptibility exponent @xmath155 , obtained using order parameter @xmath98 , shows some deviation from ising - potts values , especially close to the hon - frustrated phase boundary ( see also table i ) ; the ratio @xmath156 , obtained from the order parameter @xmath100 at @xmath101 , does not allow to differentiate between the ising and potts values . however , the scaling of both @xmath104 and @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "7b ) clearly shows that the exponent @xmath132 has to be close to the potts value , 1.2 .",
    "this result is corroborated by the scaling of the specific heat ( fig . 7a and fig .",

    "all these parameters steadily scale with the value of @xmath157 in the range @xmath158 .",
    "the scaling of the order parameter @xmath98 is not accurate enough to unambiguously discriminate between the values of @xmath64 characteristic to the potts and ising universality class .",
    "nevertheless , the scaling with the potts model pair of ratios ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) is much better than that with the corresponding ising model pair ( @xmath161 , @xmath162 ) for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath101 the exponent ratios are equal to @xmath159 , @xmath163 ( fig .",
    "a slight deviation of our results from the generic relation for critical exponents ( @xmath164 ) is mostly due to a systematic deviation of exponent @xmath155 .    in fig .",
    "8b we present binder magnetization cumulant , @xmath165 at @xmath39 .",
    "the crossing of this cumulant at @xmath166 was considered  @xcite as the indication of the ising behavior .",
    "however , the crossing of @xmath165 in the three - state potts model also occurs at approximately the same value ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained the crossing at @xmath167 .",
    "the values of the critical exponents start to vary close to both edges of the hon phase .",
    "while approaching the disordered - to - hon edge ( @xmath168 ) , we observe an increase of the exponent ratios @xmath72 , @xmath132 and @xmath73 towards the value close to 2 ( see table i at @xmath43 ) .",
    "this clearly indicates the first order phase transition . in order to determine the behavior at the tricritical region , we calculated the energy histograms presented in fig .",
    "9 . the histogram at @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "9a ) shows a peak which moves with @xmath112 along the phase transition region .",
    "such a behavior of the histograms is characteristic for almost all range of chosen @xmath0 values .",
    "it evidences a typical second order phase transition .",
    "however , close to the disordered - to - hon edge ( @xmath169 ) , the histograms are two - peaked with a high saddle point . at @xmath170 ( fig .",
    "9b ) the two - peaked histogram transits into the one peaked histogram with an increase of @xmath58 : the latent heat @xmath171 and interface tension @xmath172 approach zero , and the transition is still of the second order .",

    "however , at @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "9c ) the histograms clearly indicate that the transition is of the first - order .",
    "we believe that the tricritical point is around @xmath179 .",
    "the tricritical points of this model were already found at @xmath180 and 0.25  @xcite .",
    "the location of the tricritical point and behavior of the bl model at @xmath96 at the disordered - to - hon boundary , in general , is analogous to that of the afm bc model  @xcite at the same boundary .",
    "an interesting situation is observed at another edge . at @xmath96 ,",
    "the ground state boundary between the hon and frustrated phase is at @xmath181 .",
    "this value also marks the termination of the three - state model ( 1 ) , because the third ( vacant or partly vacant ) sublattice becomes completely occupied at @xmath182 .",
    "the phase existing at @xmath183 is only partly frustrated , since it retains some preference of @xmath184 states at sublattices a ( b ) .",
    "as shown in table i and fig .",
    "10 , the critical exponents @xmath63 and @xmath132 ( the latter obtained both from fitting of specific heat and parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) demonstrate systematic approach to the ising model values starting from @xmath86 and all the way down towards @xmath181 .",
    "the @xmath63 decreases from 1/3 at @xmath185 to 0.29 ( @xmath86 ) , 0.16 ( 0.1 ) and 0.11 ( 0.05 ) , and the @xmath132 decreases from 1.2 at @xmath185 to 1 at lower values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the peaks at @xmath39 are too small and very large lattice sizes are needed to perform a reliable scaling analysis for @xmath186 . the critical index @xmath65 is less reliable at this edge , since the susceptibility fits rather badly starting from @xmath187 . nevertheless , our results for @xmath63 and @xmath132 obtained at @xmath188 ( see table and fig .",

    "note also , that the @xmath39 point exists for some very small @xmath182 values .",

    "5a ) , where a certain hon order is established at finite temperature , there is no finite size dependence for @xmath190 , but the dependence is obvious for @xmath191 .",
    "in order to determine if the van der waals interaction might affect the values of the critical exponents , we performed some calculations for other values of @xmath192 .",
    "we did not find any important differences to compare with the @xmath96 case .",
    "as seen from the values of the critical exponents given in table i , the transitions to the hon phase at @xmath193 also belong to the three - state potts universality class .",
    "two peaks in @xmath85 dependences of the bl model at low values of chemical potential might imply that there is some intermediate phase separating the disordered ( pm ) and hon phases .",
