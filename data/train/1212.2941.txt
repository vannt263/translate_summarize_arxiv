    "the purpose of gravitational waves detection leads to construction of large - scale antennas like ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite and geo  @xcite .",
    "very high sensitivity of these devices is limited by a number of noises . in the low frequency range ( below @xmath0 hz )",
    "the prevailing sources of noise are seismic ones , at middle frequencies ( @xmath1 hz ) thermal noises dominate and in high frequency range ( over @xmath2 hz ) photon shot noise prevails . however the technical improvement of antennas by compensation and suppression of these and other noises will allow to achieve sensitivity level defined only by quantum noise which for continuous position measurement has lowest boundary defined by standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite .",
    "sql is the optimal combination of two noises of quantum nature : fluctuations of mirror motion caused by random photon number falling onto its surface and photon counting noise .",
    "one of the ways to overcome the sql is the implementation of so - called optical rigidity ( optical spring ) effect  @xcite which is based on a fact that in a detuned fabry - perot interferometer the circulating power and consequently the radiation pressure is dependent on the distance between the mirrors .",
    "it has been shown in a number of papers  @xcite that interferometers using optical springs exhibit sensitivity below the sql .    in a system utilizing optical spring there are two degrees of freedom ( in case of one pump ) : a mechanical one and an optical one .",
    "interaction of these coordinates gives birth to several eigen modes ( the number of which is equal to the system degrees of freedom number ) each of which is characterized by its own resonance frequency and damping .",
    "free evolution of the system can be represented as a sum of eigen modes each of which is an oscillator with its eigen frequency and has corresponding damping . in principle",
    "one can make transfer from the conventional coordinates to eigen ones and consider the evolution of the system as evolution of these new oscillators .    using the curve of susceptibility of the system one can estimate the average energy stored in each equivalent eigen mode oscillator .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that an oscillator with average energy @xmath3 exhibits quantum - mechanical behavior if the condition @xmath4 is met . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are eigen frequency and quality factor of oscillator .",
    "estimations  @xcite show that for system such as interferometer advanced ligo these conditions are well fulfilled . as a consequence one can expect the corresponding eigen modes to be observed in quantum state despite the fact that the ( effective ) mass of mechanical oscillator in considered interferometer is equal to 10 kg .    given this motivation",
    "it is interesting to look for any experimental scenario giving an ability to bring one of the eigen modes to non - classical state .",
    "currently the development of techniques aimed on preparation of mechanical resonator in quantum state by means of optomechanical interaction is well underway including investigations of micromembranes  @xcite , microtoroids  @xcite , optomechanical crystals  @xcite , pulse - pumped optomechanical cavities  @xcite and even large - scale gravitational - wave detectors  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important problems inherent to optomechanical devices is relatively large losses of mechanical microoscillator .",
    "replacement of material spring by optical one may decrease the losses in mechanical system and thus provide an experimental possibility of realisation of quantum regimes .    for the initial consideration",
    "it is also worth to show the very possibility of manipulation with optomechanical modes . to prove this possibility we demonstrate the mechanism to perform quadrature squeezing of shot noise caused fluctuations in these modes using parametric modulation of spring constant which has been previously considered as a tool to squeeze fluctuations in cavity mirror motion  @xcite",
    "we consider a gravitational - wave detector advanced ligo with a signal recycling mirror ( srm ) having an amplitude reflectivity @xmath7 and power recycling mirror ( prm ) ; a scheme of antenna is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : aligo ] .",
    "antenna consists of a michelson interferometer with additional mirrors forming fabry - perot ( fp ) cavities with mean distance @xmath8 between mirrors in arms .",
    "input mirrors have amplitude transmittivities @xmath9 and masses @xmath10 and output mirrors have the same masses @xmath10 and are completely reflective .",
    "we assume that all mirrors are lossless .",
    "the interferometer is pumped by laser having frequency resonant for fp cavities in arms .",
    "dynamics of this interferometer could be split into two modes : namely differential one and common one .",
    "the optical fields in the modes represent difference and sum of the fields in arms respectively and carry information about difference and sum between lengthenings of arm cavities . each mode",
    "is characterized by optical detuning and decay rate introduced by displacement of corresponding recycling mirror : srm for differential mode and prm for common one .",
    "it has been demonstrated  @xcite that each of this modes could be equivalently described using a model of fp cavity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aligo ] , bottom ) .",
    "we focus our attention to differential mode .",
    "the end mirror of equivalent cavity has mass equal to reduced mass of four mirrors of michelson interferometer and is completely reflective .",
    "the displacement of this mirror is equal to difference of arms lengthening of initial interferometer : @xmath11 .",
    "distance separating the mirrors is equal to one in initial interferometer , namely @xmath8 .",
    "the pump in equivalent scheme should be characterized by the same relaxation rate @xmath12 and detuning @xmath13 as in initial scheme and mean circulating power @xmath14 two times bigger than one in initial interferometer .",
    "a detuned pump creates in fp cavity an optical spring , that is the radiation - pressure force which depends on the distance separating mirrors of the cavity .",
    "a system with only one optical spring is always unstable because a single pump introduces either negative damping or negative rigidity  @xcite .",
    "a few ways to avoid instabilities have been proposed amongst which there are implementation of feedback  @xcite or utilization of additional pump @xcite .",
    "the latter way has been investigated in details and proven experimentally with mirror of gram - scale  @xcite .",
    "however in laboratory - scale experiment it should be easier to utilize a proper feedback .",
    "hence we consider a scheme of fp cavity with one pump and a feedback instead of two pumps .",
    "input optical fluctuations are described by annihilation operator  @xmath15 , operator @xmath16 describes output fluctuations . to avoid instability caused by optical spring",
    "we measure phase quadrature @xmath17 of output fluctuations with homodyne detector and send its derivative over time as a feedback force to the movable mirror .",
    "the dynamics of interferometer could be described in terms of two degrees of freedom .",
    "one of those is annihilation operator @xmath18 of optical fluctuations inside the interferometer ( actually , its amplitude quadrature @xmath19 ) and another is mechanical displacement @xmath20 .",
    "equations of motion for this system could be written as follows ( in capacity of mechanical coordinate we use dimensionless displacement @xmath21 ) :    [ eq : sys1 ] @xmath22     derivation of these equations from the hamiltonian of the system and exact definition of coefficients are presented in appendix  [ app : notations ]",
    ".    we use dimensionless parameters defined the same way as in  @xcite .",
    "parameter @xmath23 stands for optical relaxation rate , coupling coefficient @xmath24 is proportional to pump power , @xmath25 is the coefficient of feedback",
    ". the right parts of equations represent fluctuational forces acting on corresponding degree of freedom . as of optical one",
    "the force @xmath26 represents input vacuum fluctuations and for mechanical one @xmath27 describes vacuum fluctuations reflected by the cavity and transmitted by feedback .",
    "we neglect all other fluctuational forces including thermal and seismic ones .",
    "depending on device in consideration this first step assumption could be either realistic or not .",
    "some calculations of thermal noise influence is presented in appendix  [ app : thermal ] . in particular",
    "they show that in configuration of advanced ligo interferometer the impact of thermal noises is only slightly below the one of quantum fluctuations .",
    "the equations   look similar to ones for oscillator coupled to a free mass ( or two coupled oscillators one of which has partial frequency equal to zero ) .",
    "however we would note the difference in signs in front of the coupling terms ( proportional to @xmath24 ) : in the case of conventional coupled oscillators these signs coincide ; in our case the signs differ .",
    "this is the reason of instability which appears in absence of feedback and this is also the reason of possibility for eigen frequencies of such system to coincide ( so called double resonance case @xcite  let us remind that in case of two coupled oscillators coincidence of eigen frequencies is impossible ) .",
    "as in the case of conventional coupled oscillators one can treat the system in terms of eigen modes . the evolution of oscillator system could be written as a sum of eigen oscillations : @xmath28 index in the sum runs from 1 to the number of system degrees of freedom ( 2 for set ) .",
    "this equation could be treated as transformation from conventional coordinates @xmath29 to the eigen ones . as in eqn .",
    "one can present evolution of each of eigen modes as combination of oscillations at corresponding eigen frequencies @xmath30 and slow ( compared to these oscillations ) changing of amplitude . in case of free evolution ( zero right parts in eqns .  )",
    "quantities @xmath31 i.e. they freely decay with relaxation rates @xmath32 into the equilibrium values .",
    "vectors @xmath33 represent distribution of amplitudes in corresponding eigen modes .",
    "suppose that we have a possibility to modulate the power of pumping laser .",
    "this will result in modulation of coupling coefficient and hence it will cause shifting of eigen frequencies of system .",
    "it is well known @xcite that modulation of eigen frequency of oscillator with frequency twice bigger than its own one results in squeezing of noise in its quadratures . in this paper",
    "we show that modulation of the pumping power performs squeezing of noise in quadratures of eigen modes amplitudes .",
    "consider we harmonically modulate the pumping power at frequency @xmath34 so coupling coefficient in   depends on time : @xmath35 .",
    "assuming the quantities @xmath36 to be _ slow _ ( i.e. not to significantly change on times compared to mechanical periods ) one can plug the expression   into system   and to get rid of rapidly oscillating terms by averaging over a period @xmath37 .",

    "implementation of feedback is more feasible in small - scale experimental setups like gravitational - wave antenna prototypes  @xcite .    realization of proposed scheme in experiment could demonstrate non - classical behavior of optomechanical mode which could be useful for tests of quantum mechanics applied to macroscopic mechanical objects .",
    "we would like to underline it is not pure optical or pure mechanical , but an _ optomechanical _ degree of freedom that may exhibit quantum behavior .",
    "also a quantum state if created in an eigen mode could be transmitted into another one ( for example , by modulation of pump with difference frequency @xmath90 ) .",
