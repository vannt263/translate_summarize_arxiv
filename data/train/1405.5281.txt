    "there is a great astrophysical interest in cosmic ray ( cr ) antiprotons .",
    "it is believed that most of antiprotons originate in collisions of cr protons with interstellar medium ( ism ) gas nuclei .",
    "therefore antiprotons represent a kind of so - called secondary cr component , opposite to the primary crs , which originate in cr sources , presumably in supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the same is trough for positrons , which are the other kind of secondary cr component .    the positron energy spectrum measured recently in pamela , fermi and ams-02 experiments at kinetic energy @xmath0  gev turned out to be much flatter than it is expected for positrons created in p - p collisions in ism .",
    "this stimulated many kind of assumptions that significant part of positrons originate from new astrophysical sources such as pulsars or the annihilation of dark matter particles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .    at the same time snrs",
    "are not only the most probable sources of primary crs with energies below @xmath1  ev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also contribute significantly in the production of secondary crs due to reacceleration of already existing in ism crs and due to nuclear collisions of primary cr particles with gas nuclei leading to the creation of secondary particles which undergo subsequent acceleration by snr shock .",
    "the detailed study of these processes for the case of secondary nuclei @xcite based on the nonlinear kinetic theory of cr acceleration in snrs @xcite demonstrated that snrs are expected to contribute significantly to secondary cr spectra at kinetic energies @xmath0  gev / nucleon making it significantly flatter .",
    "therefore it is natural to suggest that the observed flattering of positron energy spectrum at @xmath0  gev can be partly or even predominantly due to snr contribution .",
    "simple estimate @xcite and the detailed study @xcite have indeed confirmed that the observed flat high energy positron spectrum is consistent with the expected snr contribution .",
    "( note that both these studies were performed in the leaky - box framework which is a poor approximation for electrons and positrons .",
    "more detailed consideration , based on the diffusive model for cr prpopagation in the ism @xcite , confirmed such a conclusion . )",
    "one can therefore expect that snrs also contribute significantly to antiproton spectrum at high energies .    here",
    "we calculate the energy spectrum of antiprotons produced in snrs to compare it with the existing data and make the prediction at higher energies @xmath2  gev where experimental data are not existed yet . as a consistency check ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar point ) we have also calculated within the same model the energy spectra of secondary nuclei and show that measured boron - to - carbon ratio is consistent with the considerable snr contribution .",
    "acceleration of crs in snrs starts at some relatively low energy when some kind of suprathermal particles begin to cross the snr shock front . any mechanism which supply suprathermal particles into the shock acceleration",
    "is called injection",
    ".    some small fraction of the postshock thermal particle population are able to recross the shock that means the beginning of their shock acceleration .",
    "this is the most general and the most intense injection mechanism .",
    "it occurs for all kind of ions and electrons existing in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and therefore it is relevant for primary crs only .",
    "the corresponding injection rate is determined by the number of particles involved into the acceleration from each medium volume crossed the shock and can be represented in the form @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gas number density , @xmath5 is the sound speed , the subscripts 1(2 ) refer to the point just ahead ( behind ) the shock .",
    "typical values of the dimensionless injection parameters which provide cr production with required efficiency are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "secondary crs like secondary nuclei li , be , b or positrons and antiprotons by definition are not presented in ism and therefore they can not be produced due to such an injection .",
    "kinetic energy of all kind of galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) particles is considerably larger then the energy of gas particles injected from the postshock thermal pool .",
    "therefore all gcrs which meet the expanding snr shock are naturally involved into the diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "cr acceleration due to this second relevant injection mechanism is usually called `` reacceleration '' .",
    "this term is used to distinguish the process of further increase of energy of already energetic particles due to interactions with snr shocks during their propagation in ism . in this regard",
    "it is similar to the stochastic acceleration ( also called reacceleration ) of gcrs due to their interactions with background mhd - turbulence .",
    "since gcr energy spectra are relatively steep and it have a peak at kinetic energy @xmath8  gev their injection can be represented in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of gcr species per unit volume and @xmath11 is their mean momentum , that corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "primary nuclei during their acceleration inside snrs produce secondary nuclei in nuclear collisions with the background gas like gcrs do it in the galactic disk .",
    "essential fraction of these already energetic particles has possibility to be involved in further shock acceleration .",
    "this is the third mechanism of secondary cr production inside snrs .",
    "for the first time it was studied to describe the formation of the secondary cr nuclei spectra @xcite .",
    "the production rate of secondary cr particles due to the nuclear collisions of primary crs with the gas nuclei within snr can be described by the source term @xmath13 in the transport equation for the distribution function of secondary crs @xmath14 .",
    "here @xmath15 is inelastic cross - section of secondary crs production with momentum @xmath16 in the collision of primary ( parent ) nuclei of momentum @xmath17 with the gas nuclei , @xmath18 is the time interval since the supernova explosion , @xmath19 is the radial distance from the presupernova star . in the case of secondary nuclei li ,",
    "be , b the parent nuclei are heavier nuclei c , n , o , whereas in the case antiprotons all kind of accelerated in snrs nuclei ( predominantly protons ) play a role of parent nuclei .",
    "reacceleration and the acceleration of nuclei created in snrs in nuclear collisions are of the prime importance for the secondary crs even though relatively small part of primary crs is also produced due to these processes .",
    "the source term @xmath20 describes the creation of secondaries throughout the remnant , everywhere downstream and upstream of snr shock up to the distances @xmath21 of the order of the diffusive length @xmath22 of their parent primary crs .",
    "essential part of these particles are naturally involving in the acceleration at snr shock .",
    "it includes all the particles created upstream and the particles created downstream at distances less then their diffusive length @xmath23 from the shock front .",
    "the number of these particles is increasing function of their momentum because @xmath24 for the bohm type diffusion coefficient @xmath25 which is realized during efficient cr acceleration in snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this makes the secondary particle spectra @xmath26 produced in snr , harder compared with the spectra of primaries @xmath27 .",
    "the snr efficiently accelerates crs up to some maximal age @xmath28 when snr release all previously accelerated crs , primaries and secondaries , with the spectra @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , into surrounding ism . here",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the kinetic energy and speed of particle with momentum @xmath16 .",
    "the number of secondary crs involved into the reacceleration at the snr evolutionary epoch @xmath18 is proportional to the snr volume @xmath33 , therefore @xmath34 .",
    "this is not so for primary crs because the progressively increasing number of injected crs @xmath35 is accompanied by the decrease of their momentum @xmath36 due to the shock deceleration . as a result",
    "the number of primary relativistic crs @xmath27 remains nearly constant at late sedov evolutionary phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence the number of secondary crs created in nuclear collisions @xmath37 increases at late evolutionary phases proportionally to snr age @xmath18 . due to above factors secondary crs",
    "are manly produced on the late snr evolutionary phases @xmath38 .",
    "these crs released from snrs together with secondary crs produced in ism form the total secondary @xmath39 and primary @xmath40 cr populations . at sufficiently high energies the s / p ratio of nuclear component within simple leaky box model is given by the expression @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the spectrum of secondaries produced in nuclear collisions of primary crs within the galactic disk . within the leaky box model it is approximately given by the expression @xcite @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the escape length which is the mean matter thickness traversed by gcrs in the course of their random walk in the galaxy",
    ", @xmath45 is the ism gas density , @xmath46 is the cr escape time from the galaxy , @xmath47 is the proton mass , @xmath48 note that at sufficiently high energies the s / p ratio @xmath49 is determined by the s / p ratio @xmath50 produced in the snrs independently on the propagation model which influence the ratio @xmath51 .",
    "we have calculated the overall energy spectra of all relevant cr species accelerated in snrs , within kinetic nonlinear model .",
    "the model is based on a fully time - dependent self - consistent solution of the cr transport equation together with the gas dynamic equations in spherical symmetry .",
    "it includes the most relevant physical factors , essential for the evolution and cr acceleration in a snr and it is able to make quantitative predictions of the expected properties of crs produced in snrs and their nonthermal radiation .",
    "the application of the theory to individual snrs has demonstrated its capability of explaining the observed snr nonthermal emission properties @xcite .",
    "the theory is able to explain major characteristics of the observed cr spectrum up to an energy of @xmath52  ev ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "similar approach was developed recently by other authors @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves by the most simple case of type ia sn in uniform ism with corresponding sn parameter values : explosion energy @xmath53  erg and ejecta mass@xmath54 .",
    "we use typical values of the dimensionless parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 , which describes the injection of gas particles into the shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "we consider the typical ism with hydrogen number density @xmath57  @xmath58 , temperature @xmath59  k and magnetic field values 5  @xmath60 g , which roughly corresponds to the average ism within the galactic disk .",
    "we adopt time - independent upstream magnetic field value @xmath61 and ignore magnetic field amplification effect because the secondaries are mainly produced at the late evolutionary phases @xcite when this effect becomes irrelevant .",
    "we perform selfconsistent calculation up to the snr age @xmath28 when snr release all previously accelerated crs into surrounding ism .",
    "we adopt the value @xmath62  yr appropriate for considered range of ism density @xcite .    calculated antiproton - to - proton ratio @xmath63 as a function of energy together with pamela data are shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we use the crossection @xmath64 , parametrization of @xcite for crossection of antiproton production in p - p collisions @xmath65 and correction factor 1.6 which describes the contribution of heavier nuclei .",
    "since the observed antiproton spectrum has a peak at @xmath66  gev we use @xmath67  @xmath58 and the value of @xmath68 which corresponds to the kinetic energy @xmath69  gev . for the spectrum of antiprotons produced in ism we use the results of calculations performed in @xcite .",
    "it is very close to what was used by @xcite in their similar consideration .",
    "it is seen that antiprotons at energies @xmath70  gev are produced in snrs equally effectively by both mechanisms whereas at @xmath71  gev the creation of antiprotons in p - p collisions and their subsequent acceleration becomes dominant . in total the antiproton production in snrs makes the energy dependence of @xmath72 considerably more flatter so that at @xmath73  gev the ratio becomes larger by a factor of about five . within the energy range 30  gev  @xmath74  gev the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath75",
    "is expected to be very flat .",
    "pamela data , which well agrees with our calculation , within the energy range 10  gev  @xmath76  gev provide the evidence that the actual ratio @xmath72 is indeed more flatter than it is expected if antiprotons are created in ism only .",
    "the production of antiprotons in snrs estimated by @xcite is considerably larger ( by a factor of four at @xmath77  gev ) compared with our calculation even though these authors have neglected the reacceleration process at all .",
    "it is due to a number of simplifications made by these authors .",
    "for example in actual situation the overlap between the radial profile of protons @xmath78 with the gas density profile @xmath79 which has a peak value @xmath80 at the shock @xmath81 , progressively decreases with increase of energy at high energies @xmath82  gev , because the radial profile of protons becomes progressively broader . here",
    "@xmath83 is the gas density of ism .",
    "this leads to the decrease of the effective gas density from the value @xmath84 to @xmath85 and to @xmath86 that follows by the decrease of the antiproton production .",
    "this factor was neglected by @xcite , that is one of the reason which lead them to overestimation of antiproton production .    in order to check the consistency of other types of secondary cr production we have calculated within the same model the boron - to - carbon ( b / c ) ratio and",
    "compare it in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] with the existing experimental data .",
    "the boron nuclei represent the example of secondary nuclei . to calculate boron spectrum we use the overall number density of boron nuclei in ism @xmath87  @xmath58 injected at a kinetic energy @xmath88  gev / n which corresponds to the mean gcr energy for these element . compared with the previous study @xcite except c , n and o nuclei as parent species following @xcite and @xcite we included also heavier primaries up to si , which contribute about 10% into the boron production .    due to boron production in snrs",
    "the expected b / c ratio undergoes considerable flattering which starts at energy @xmath89  gev / nucleon .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] this is consistent with the measurements recently performed in balloon @xcite and ams-02 space @xcite experiments even though for more strict conclusion one needs the measurements with higher statistics at energies above 1  tev / n .",
    "calculated snr contribution into the secondary cr spectra represents the component which is unavoidably expected if snrs are the main source of gcrs .",
    "comparison with the existing data leads to a conclusion that the observed high energy excess of secondary nuclei can be produced in galactic snrs .",
    "this enable to expect similar excess in the antiproton energy spectrum .",
    "the data expected very soon from ams-02 experiment will make it clear whether the actual ratio @xmath72 is indeed not less flat at energies @xmath90  gev then we predict .",
