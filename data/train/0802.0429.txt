    "the distribution function ( df ) provides the most general and complete way of statistical description of dark matter ( dm ) haloes .",
    "it carries maximum information on the spatial and velocity distributions of particles in such objects .",
    "our knowledge on the df is still being improved , mostly due to numerical experiments . in the last few years cosmological simulations",
    "have revealed increasingly detailed features of phase - space structure of dm haloes .",
    "these numerical results provide useful constraints on theoretical models of the df .",
    "one property of interest in this field is the anisotropy of the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the outer parts of the haloes exhibit more radially anisotropic trajectories than the halo centre ( see e.g. coln , klypin & kravtsov 2000 ; fukushige & makino 2001 ; wojtak et al .",
    "2005 ; mamon & okas 2005 ; cuesta et al .",
    "this feature , besides the well - studied density profile , has been considered as the main point of reference in the attempts at construction of a reliable model of the df .",
    "so far , a few approaches to this problem have been proposed .",
    "cuddeford ( 1991 ) generalized the osipkov - merritt model ( osipkov 1979 ; merritt 1985 ) to the df which generates an arbitrary anisotropy in the halo centre and becomes fully radial at infinity .",
    "although an analytical inversion for these models exists , the anisotropy profile can not be reconciled with the numerical results : the rise from central to outer anisotropy is too sharp and the outer orbits are too radial ( see mamon & okas 2005 ) .",
    "an & evans ( 2006a ) noticed that a non - trivial profile of the anisotropy can be obtained from a sum of dfs with a constant anisotropy for which an analytical inversion is known ( cuddeford 1991 ; kochanek 1996 ; wilkinson & evans 1999 ) .",
    "however , the resulting anisotropy profiles are decreasing functions of radius and do not agree with those measured in cosmological simulations . recently a very elegant method has been presented by baes & van hese ( 2007 ) .",
    "the authors introduced a general ansatz for the anisotropy profile and then , for a given potential - density pair , derived the df as a series of some special functions .",
    "this approach works well under the condition that the potential can be expressed as an elementary function of the corresponding density .",
    "this requirement , however , is not satisfied by many models , including the nfw density profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) which is commonly used as a good approximation of the universal density profile of dm haloes .",
    "the df inferred from the simulation gives a possibility to test directly the analytical models .",
    "according to the jeans theorem any spherically symmetric system in the state of equilibrium should possess a df which is a function only of energy and the absolute value of angular momentum .",
    "this theoretical postulate was taken into account in the computation carried out by voglis ( 1994 ) and natarajan , hjorth & van kampen ( 1997 ) . in the first case",
    "the df was obtained for a single relaxed halo which formed from cosmologically consistent initial conditions .",
    "it was shown that there were two main contributions to the df , the halo population and the core population of particles .",
    "both were effectively described by two independent phenomenological fits .",
    "natarajan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) determined the df for a sample of cluster - size haloes formed in cosmological simulations .",
    "their selection of objects included those with substructures and departing from equilibrium .",
    "they also discussed and took into account in their calculation the effect of boundary conditions defined by the virial sphere .",
    "however , the final results were not used to test quantitatively any model of the df .",
    "it seems that two main approaches to study the df , namely theoretical modelling and feedback from the simulations , evolved rather separately barely crossing each other .",
    "the rare exceptions include the work of okas & mamon ( 2001 ) who used the eddington formula to derive numerically the df following from the nfw profile in the isotropic case and that of widrow ( 2000 ) who considered more general cuspy profiles and osipkov - merritt anisotropy . this paper is devoted to combining both approaches and providing a coherent analysis of the df from the viewpoints of the simulations as well as the model construction .",
    "our main aim is to propose a phenomenological model of the df that recovers the results from the simulations as accurately as possible .",
    "our effort is mainly motivated by the future applications of the derived df to the dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters .",
    "although subhaloes in general have different density and velocity distributions than dm particles ( diemand , moore & stadel 2004 ) , massive subhaloes ( those likely to host galaxies ) are distributed like dm particles ( faltenbacher & diemand 2006 ) . although the correspondence between the massive subhaloes and galaxies in real clusters remains to be proven , our results should at least in principle",
    "be applicable to kinematic data sets for galaxy clusters .",
    "the traditional approach to do such modelling was to reproduce the velocity dispersion profile of the galaxies by solving the jeans equation ( see e.g. katgert , biviano & mazure 2004 ) .",
    "it is well known however that from the dispersion alone one can not constrain all the interesting parameters ( such as the virial mass , the concentration of the nfw profile and anisotropy ) because of the density - anisotropy degeneracy .",
    "one can break this degeneracy by using the fourth order velocity moment , the kurtosis , and solving an additional higher - order jeans equation ( okas 2002 ; okas & mamon 2003 ; okas et al . 2006 ; wojtak & okas 2007 ) .",
    "although this approach has many advantages ( e.g. it does not require the knowledge of the full df ) , it has been applied till now only for constant - anisotropy models and the calculation of velocity moments requires the binning of the data in which some information is lost . since the number of galaxies with measured redshifts per cluster is still rather low ( of the order of a few hundred for the best - studied , nearby clusters ) it is essential that all the available information is used .",
    "this can be obtained by fitting the projected df to the data directly .",
    "a few approaches along these lines have been attempted already .",
    "for example , mahdavi & geller ( 2004 ) used a simple df of the form @xmath11 ( which yields constant anisotropy ) to constrain the mass profile and orbital structure using combined kinematic data sets for nearby galaxy groups and clusters , while van der marel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in their study of cnoc clusters did not assume an explicit form for the energy - dependent part of the df , but still used the constant anisotropy .",
    "wojtak et al .",
    "( 2007 ) used a simplified form of the projected isotropic df constructed from the projected density combined with a gaussian distribution for the line - of - sight velocities to study the properties of members versus interlopers in simulated kinematic data sets .",
    "none of the dfs used so far , however , reflects accurately the true properties of cluster - size dm haloes found in @xmath12-body simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides the theoretical framework and defines all the basic quantities used later on in the paper . in the next section",
    "we discuss the details of the computation of the df of dm particles in the haloes formed from cosmological simulations and provide examples of the results .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the derivation of a phenomenological model of the df ; we discuss the separability of the df in energy and angular momentum and present an explicit formula for the @xmath4-dependent part of df .",
    "an extensive comparison of the model with the simulations is presented in section 5 , where we also provide an analytical approximation for the energy - dependent part of the df obtained for an average halo .",
    "finally , the discussion follows in section 6 .",
    "this section summarizes the theoretical background of the paper .",
    "first , we introduce scaling properties consistent with the nfw density profile .",
    "we will use this profile in the paper , but our approach is not restricted to this particular density distribution and can be easily generalized to any profile consistent with simulations ( see below ) .",
    "second , we briefly describe the relation between the differential df and the df itself . finally , we discuss the consequences of the finite volume of the virialized area of a halo .",
    "in particular , the relation between the df and its differential form is properly modified to account for this effect .",
    "it is a well known fact that the density profiles of dm haloes formed in cosmological simulations exhibit striking similarity .",
    "nfw showed that most of them are well fitted within the virial sphere by the universal two - parameter profile which can be expressed in the following way @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the two free parameters are the scale radius @xmath15 and the mass enclosed within the sphere of this radius @xmath16 .",
    "the ( positive ) gravitational potential inferred from the poisson equation reads ( cole & lacey 1996 ; see also okas & mamon 2001 ) @xmath17 where the velocity unit @xmath18 is related to the circular velocity @xmath19 at the scale radius via @xmath20 .",
    "let us note that @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 define a set of natural units of the nfw model . by scaling any quantity by a proper combination of them we remove the explicit dependence on the free parameters of the nfw model .",
    "this is an essential property if we want to study the dynamics of a whole class of haloes with nfw - like density profiles .",
    "hereafter , we will keep this scaling in all equations in the text . in many places",
    "we will also use a unit of the angular momentum @xmath21 as a substitute for @xmath22 .",
    "the df is a fundamental concept in statistical mechanics of @xmath12-body systems .",
    "it describes the phase - space density of particles of such a system without any detailed knowledge of the time evolution of @xmath12 trajectories . following the jeans theorem ,",
    "a steady - state df , which is of interest for us here , depends on the phase - space coordinates only through the integrals of motion .",
    "although the shape of dm haloes is in general better approximated by a three - axial ellipsoid rather than a sphere ( see e.g. gottlber & yepes 2007 ) , it is still very effective to assume spherical symmetry in dynamical approach . given that the streaming motions and internal rotation within the virial sphere are negligible compared to higher velocity moments , spherical symmetry implies that the df can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath3 is the positively defined binding energy and @xmath4 the absolute value of the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath24 the gravitational potential in equation ( [ e_def ] ) is related to the df through the poisson equation @xmath25    the most natural and straightforward probe of @xmath26 in numerical experiments is the so - called differential df defined in the following way @xmath27 one may intuitively interpret this function as mass density in energy - angular momentum space .",
    "the df itself can be simply derived dividing @xmath28 by the volume @xmath29 of the hypersurface of constant energy and angular momentum embedded in the phase space @xmath30 it is easy to show that the volume of this hypersurface reads ( see appendix a ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the radial period of an orbit given by the following integral over radius from the pericentre to the apocentre @xmath33}}.\\ ] ]    the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ g_vol ] shows a contour map of @xmath29 ( dotted lines ) calculated for the nfw gravitational potential ( [ psi_nfw ] ) .",
    "the @xmath34 line is the profile of maximum angular momentum which consists of points corresponding to circular orbits .",
    "this curve divides the energy - angular momentum plane into an area describing the physical orbits of a system ( below @xmath35 ) and the zone not permitted by mechanics ( above @xmath35 ) .",
    "note that we are using the scaling relations introduced in the previous subsection so the results do not depend explicitly on the halo mass @xmath16 and the scale radius @xmath15 . in some places later on we will refer to the inverse function for @xmath34 by @xmath36 .",
    "voglis ( 1994 ) and natarajan et al . (",
    "1997 ) showed that the dependence of @xmath32 on the angular momentum is very weak and could be neglected without loss of precision .",
    "this is understandable if we note that the nfw - like potentials are still not so far away from the isochrone potential @xmath37 which leads to purely energy - dependent @xmath38 proportional to @xmath39 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "following natarajan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) we will use this feature to simplify expression ( [ g(e , l ) ] ) . to do this",
    "we first note that the volume of the hypersurface of constant energy @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 taking advantage of the weak dependence of @xmath42 on @xmath4 , equation ( [ t_r ] ) , we get @xmath43 on the other hand , one can show that @xmath44 reads ( see appendix a ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the apocentre radius of the radial orbit . inserting ( [ g_e_gen ] ) into ( [ g_app ] ) one immediately gets a very simple approximation for @xmath29 involving only a one - dimensional integral without singularities , in contrast with @xmath47 derived by expression ( [ t_r ] ) .",
    "we find that this approximation reproduces the exact formula ( [ g(e , l ) ] ) with enough accuracy .",
    "taking advantage of its numerical simplicity we use it in majority of our calculations .",
    "so far we have discussed the relation between the df and its differential form for an infinite system . in practice , however , we restrict our numerical analysis to the interior of the virial sphere which separates the equilibrium part of a halo from the infall region .",
    "we define the virial radius @xmath48 of this sphere by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the virial mass , @xmath51 is the present critical density and @xmath52 is the virial overdensity .",
    "another parameter commonly used to describe the size of the virial sphere in terms of @xmath15 is the concentration @xmath53 .",

    "contrary to the conclusion of natarajan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , we find that the approximation ( [ g_app ] ) is no longer justified for orbits extending beyond the virial sphere ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that angular momentum dependence of ( [ t_r_trun ] ) becomes non - negligible and the integral ( [ g_e ] ) can not be simplified to the form of ( [ g_app ] ) .    using ( [ g(e , l ) ] ) and",
    "( [ t_r_trun ] ) with the nfw potential , we calculated @xmath29 for a halo limited by the virial sphere of radius @xmath56 ( see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ g_vol ] ) .",
    "as expected , the result differs from an infinite system by the orbits with @xmath55 and remains unchanged for trajectories wholly included within the virial sphere .",
    "for our @xmath12-body simulation we have assumed the wmap3 cosmology ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) with matter density @xmath57 , the cosmological constant @xmath58 , the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath59 , the spectral index of primordial density perturbations @xmath60 and the normalization of power spectrum @xmath61 .",
    "we have used a box of size @xmath62 and @xmath63 particles . thus the particle mass was @xmath64 .",
    "starting at redshift @xmath65 we followed the evolution using the mpi version of the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) code ( kravtsov , klypin & khokhlov 1997 ) .",
    "we identified clusters with the hierarchical friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) with a linking length of 0.17 times the mean inter - particle distance which roughly corresponds to an overdensity of 330 .",
    "we have selected 36 clusters at redshift @xmath66 in the range of virial mass ( 0.15 - 2 ) @xmath67 , where the virial overdensity parameter appropriate for our cosmological model was assumed @xmath68 ( okas & hoffman 2001 ) .",
    "our sample did not include clusters with two substructures of approximately the same mass and a poor fit of the nfw profile suggestive of a recent major merger .",
    "starting from the fof position of the cluster we have determined the highest density peak as the final centre of the clusters .",
    "this centre coincides with the position of the most massive substructure found at the linking length 8 times shorter and also with the position of the halo found by the bdm halo finder ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) .      in the first step of the computation",
    "we calculate the binding energy ( [ e_def ] ) and the angular momentum ( [ l_def ] ) per unit mass for each particle within the virial sphere of each halo .",
    "spherical symmetry implies that we have to apply in ( [ e_def ] ) the radial profile of the gravitational potential @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "however , the mass profile of the equilibrium part of a halo reaches no further than the virial radius . on the other hand , all analytical models of the df",
    "involve the density profile extending to infinity .",
    "we found that the only coherent way to reconcile both facts is to split the integral ( [ pot_num_0 ] ) in two parts @xmath71 the first term is evaluated numerically by integration of a discrete mass profile .",
    "the second term is an analytical extension with the nfw density profile which is an assumption of the df model introduced in the following section .",
    "its contribution to the potential is a constant equal to @xmath72 .",
    "[ halo_1_sc ] shows the resulting energies and angular momenta of particles inside the virial sphere of one of the simulated haloes .",
    "the profile of the maximum angular momentum ( solid line ) and the profile of vanishing radial velocity at the virial sphere ( dashed line ) were calculated for the exact gravitational potential given by ( [ pot_num_1 ] ) .",
    "all particles occupy the area permitted by mechanics or lie very close to the boundary line . interestingly ,",
    "quite a large fraction of them have orbits extending beyond the virial sphere .",
    "as noted in the previous section , we keep @xmath73 and @xmath21 as units of energy and angular momentum respectively .",
    "the parameters of the nfw model were obtained for each halo by fitting the nfw formula to the density profile measured in logarithmic radial bins .    in the next step",
    "we determine for each halo the differential df given by ( [ n(e , l ) ] ) . in this calculation",
    "we used our own version of the fiestas ( field estimator for arbitrary spaces ) algorithm designed to infer the density field from a scatter diagram embedded in a space of any number of dimensions ( see ascasibar & binney 2005 for more details ) . as a result of this computation",
    "we get an estimate of @xmath28 at all points of the energy - angular momentum plane corresponding to the particles inside the virial sphere .",
    "once @xmath28 is calculated the df can be easily obtained via ( [ n(e , l ) ] ) .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , we used approximation ( [ g_app ] ) for the orbits contained inside the virial sphere and the exact formula ( [ g(e , l ) ] ) with ( [ t_r_trun ] ) for trajectories extending beyond @xmath48 .",
    "we found that the additional advantage of expression ( [ g_app ] ) is that it could be evaluated at any point of the energy - angular momentum plane .",
    "this helps us to keep the estimates of the df obtained for points with angular momentum lying slightly above @xmath34 .    in order to derive a contour map or a profile of the df",
    "we introduce a regular dense mesh on the energy - angular momentum plane and find the median value of the df in each cell .",
    "such a set of median points is considered as the final numerical approximation of the df and is used in preparation of all plots in this paper .",

    "the interval between the iso - df lines is fixed at value @xmath75 of the logarithmic scale .",
    "the lack of the df estimation in the lower part of each diagram arises from the fact that this zone is occupied by very few particles ( see e.g. fig .  [ halo_1_sc ] ) so that no information on the distribution can be retrieved .",

    "a general form of the df for spherical systems in the state of equilibrium is a function of energy and the absolute value of angular momentum @xmath26 . in our approach",

    "it is clearly seen that the anisotropy is typically a growing function of radius , with values @xmath82 in the halo centre and @xmath83 at the virial sphere ( see e.g. mamon & okas 2005 and cuesta et al .",

    "it seems that a simple and general enough analytical model of the anisotropy should possess at least three free parameters which determine asymptotic values of @xmath84 for small and large radii and a scale of transition between them .",
    "we proceed with the construction of such a model by introducing a proper ansatz for @xmath85 .",
    "louis ( 1993 ) showed that the following asymptotes of the angular momentum part of the df @xmath86 where @xmath8 is an angular momentum constant , lead to constant anisotropy @xmath7 at infinity ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 in the halo centre .",
    "this result can be easily generalized to the case of a non - isotropic velocity distribution in both limits of radius .",
    "first , let us note that the central part of the halo is dominated by the particles with small angular momenta , namely @xmath89 . then , remembering that the df of constant anisotropy takes the form ( hnon 1973 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; okas 2002 ) @xmath90 it is easy to notice that the formula ( [ f_l_louis ] ) can be rewritten in the following way @xmath91 where @xmath6 is the central anisotropy of a system . as shown by an & evans ( 2006b ) ,",
    "the upper limit for @xmath6 is equal to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the density profile near the halo centre .",

    "furthermore , the simplicity of formula ( [ f_l ] ) guarantees that the energy part of the df can be quite easily calculated via the inversion of the integral equation @xmath96 the key idea of this procedure lies in an analytical simplification of the right - hand side of ( [ rho_df ] ) to a one - dimensional integral .",
    "the resulting equation is then solved numerically for @xmath9 .",
    "the technical details of this calculation are summarized in appendix b. once the full form of the df is determined one can also calculate the velocity moments .",

    "we calculate the ratio of the df from the simulation to the energy part of the df model with parameters adjusted to the anisotropy profile from the simulation . under the assumption that the real df is factorizable in energy and angular momentum",
    ", we can expect that the resulting ratio should be a weak function of energy equal to @xmath85 given by ( [ f_l ] ) .",
    "[ separability ] shows that the variations of this ratio with respect to @xmath85 are of the same order as the width of the interquartile range which means that separability is acceptable from the statistical point of view .",
    "a small systematic deviation can be seen for @xmath125 . however , this is certainly a local feature since this trend is not repeated in other profiles .",
    "let us emphasize that this test of separability depends strongly on the reliability of @xmath85 .",
    "one can imagine that an incorrect form of @xmath85 would likely lead to a negative result of the test , whether @xmath26 is separable or not .",
    "on the contrary , a positive result of such a test in our case means that not only is the assumption of factorization valid but the approximation for @xmath85 is reasonable as well .",
    "further comparison between the simulation and the df model can be done in terms of velocity moments .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ moments ] where the dispersion and kurtosis of the radial and tangential velocity are plotted . in the bottom part of this figure",
    "we show the profiles of the anisotropy @xmath84 and @xmath126 parameter which measures the anisotropy of a tensor of the fourth velocity moment . by analogy with the parameter @xmath84 we defined @xmath127 in the following way @xmath128 the dashed lines in each panel of fig .",
    "[ moments ] are the model predictions , except for the @xmath84 profile ( lower left panel ) which is a fit of the model providing constraints on parameter values given in the previous subsection .",
    "theoretical dispersion profiles coincide very well with the profiles from the simulation .",
    "we notice quite a good agreement also for the @xmath127 parameter . on the other hand , theoretical profiles of the kurtosis",
    "are systematically biased towards higher values , but typically by less than 10 percent .",
    "nevertheless , their shapes clearly recover the shapes of the median profiles from the simulation",
    ". moreover , for both the radial and tangential velocity a characteristic growth of @xmath129 from value @xmath130 around the virial radius up to @xmath131 in the halo centre , is seen .",
    "although the kurtosis bias is enclosed within acceptable limits ( kurtosis is known to be sensitive to any noise ) , it would be desirable to find out the reason for this behaviour .",
    "since our statistical samples consist of @xmath132 particles per radial bin , we ruled out a possibility of a bias of the kurtosis estimator ( see okas & mamon 2003 ) .",
    "we also excluded the possibility that this is caused by some specific assumptions of the model .",
    "for example , changing the nfw density distribution to the 3d sersic profile , which fits the simulation data even better ( navarro et al .",
    "2004 ; merritt et al . 2005 ; prada et al .",
    "2006 ) , we still encounter the same bias . in addition , perturbing the model parameters of @xmath85 does not explain the situation either .",
    "we therefore conclude that the slight discrepancy in the predictions of our model concerning the kurtosis must signify reaching the limitations of the theoretical approach based on using the global , smooth gravitational potential of a system .",
    "we suppose that the problem is caused by the presence of substructures which perturb locally the trajectories of particles with respect to the orbits determined by the global potential of a halo .",
    "what one gets from the simulation is really a convolution of the velocity distribution expected from the model involving a global potential with the distribution of velocity perturbations occurring due to density fluctuations .",
    "the estimation of the importance of this effect is a complicated task since the perturbation of the particle orbit depends on many variables , such as the distribution of substructures , softening of the potential and particle velocity .",
    "however , some qualitative conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , note that low - velocity particles are affected by the density perturbations more strongly .",
    "consequently , the peak of the resulting velocity distribution is suppressed and the tails are preserved which may effectively decrease the kurtosis ( see fig .",
    "[ moments ] ) .",
    "second , the effect of the perturbation on the velocity dispersion is a higher order correction compared to the dispersion obtained for a system with a global potential .",
    "this means that the resulting dispersion profiles are barely changed and they are still expected to coincide well with theoretical predictions .",
    "it seems an intriguing issue that the profile of tangential kurtosis signifies gaussianity of the velocity distribution at radii around @xmath15 where the logarithmic slope of the density profile is equal to @xmath133 .",
    "one could suppose that some signatures of the so - called isothermal sphere are locally present .",
    "interestingly , this statement is also supported by the shape of the df for @xmath134 that is the energy range of particles at @xmath135 . referring to the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ df_comp ] it is easy to notice that the df grows exponentially with energy , as expected for systems not very different from the isothermal sphere .",
    "the distribution of the radial velocity , on the other hand , takes the gaussian form for radii around @xmath136 .",
    "this difference could be a consequence of the non - vanishing anisotropy parameter , which is not accounted for in the classical formulation of the isothermal model ( binney 1982 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "so far we tested the df model for a typical halo associated with the median properties of our halo sample . in order to check",
    "the applicability of our model more extensively we repeat such comparison for single haloes .",
    "the df in this case is expected to differ from one halo to another due to the observed variety of anisotropy profiles .",
    "results of this analysis are summarized in fig .  [",
    "4haloes ] . to save space we included only five haloes with representative , rather different anisotropy profiles ( upper panels ) , from the most strongly increasing profile in the left panel to a decreasing one on the right - hand side .",
    "the second and fifth panels correspond to the haloes for which contour maps of the df are shown in fig .",
    "[ halo_1_df ] ( the top and bottom panel respectively ) .",
    "we restricted the number of profiles to those most essential : we plot the dispersion and kurtosis of the radial velocity and the anisotropies @xmath84 and @xmath127 .",
    "we also show the profiles of the df for three values of angular momentum or energy . in all panels",
    "the solid lines represent simulation results , whereas dashed lines are the predictions of the model . as in fig .",
    "[ moments ] , dashed lines in the case of parameter @xmath84 indicate best fitting profiles of the model .",
    "gray regions in the panels of two bottom rows mark the interquartile ranges of the df which describe the scatter of points resulting from the fiestas algorithm .    from the analysis of fig .",
    "[ 4haloes ] we conclude that all profiles , regardless of the anisotropy , are very well reproduced by our model of the df . in general",
    ", the theoretical df does not exceed the limits of the interquartile range or lies very close to its boundaries ( see two bottom rows of panels in fig .  [ 4haloes ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the agreement is usually almost equally good when the model is applied to the haloes with massive substructures which were rejected from our sample .",
    "this is certainly good news for the future applications of our df to the dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters which very often display signatures of recent major mergers .",

    "the second column gives the parameter values for the model fitted to the anisotropy for the average halo from the simulation ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) and the third one gives the values which reproduce the df for the anisotropy profile ( [ ml_beta ] ) ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath121 was assumed .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < \" , ]     the df discussed in the first subsection is typical in a sense that it describes the statistical macrostate of dm particles in a typical massive halo . with future applications in mind we decided to provide an analytical approximation for the energy part @xmath9 of this df which could be used as a substitute for a rather complicated procedure described in appendix b. we found that the following expression reproduces the numerical df with good accuracy @xmath137}\\nonumber \\\\      & & \\times(1-e)^{-\\alpha_{2}/\\{1+\\exp[(1-e)/e_{2})]\\ } } \\label{f_e_appr},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the values of the parameters are listed in the middle column of table  [ parameters ] . for completeness",
    "we recall that the angular momentum part of the df is given by ( [ f_l ] ) with @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "we have verified that the errors of the dispersion , kurtosis and both anisotropies , when using this approximate formula in the integrals for velocity moments , do not exceed 5 percent within the radial range @xmath138 ( see fig .",
    "[ errors ] ) .",
    "note that the general form of expression ( [ f_e_appr ] ) can be effectively used to approximate the df model also for other sets of parameters .",
    "as a second example we include in the third column of the table also the parameters of a model with @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath121 which mimics the anisotropy profile ( [ ml_beta ] ) with @xmath139 .",
    "we have studied the df of dm particles inside the virial spheres of the haloes of mass @xmath0@xmath1 formed in the standard @xmath2cdm cosmological @xmath12-body simulation . in the first part of the paper we presented results of the calculation of the df from the simulation in the form most suitable for comparison with theoretical models .",
    "then we proposed a phenomenological model of the df .",
    "the model in its part dependent on angular momentum involves three free parameters which specify the anisotropy profile , namely its asymptotic values and the scale of transition between them .",
    "we demonstrated that this parametrization is sufficient to reproduce accurately the simulation results in terms of velocity moments as well as the df itself .",
    "the only discrepant point we encountered was a small but statistically significant bias of the theoretical kurtosis with respect to its profiles measured from the simulation .",
    "this is probably caused by the presence of substructures perturbing the trajectories of low - velocity particles .    in section 5",
    "we showed that the velocity distribution of a typical halo changes from a flat - topped distribution ( @xmath140 ) in the outer part to a peaked one ( @xmath141 ) near the centre .",
    "this behaviour was noticed and discussed by others before ( e.g. kazantzidis , magorrian & moore 2004 ; wojtak et al .",
    "the analysis of the df presented here suggests that this property of the velocity distribution is correlated with the profile of the anisotropy increasing with @xmath142 : @xmath84 profiles growing faster with @xmath142 imply more rapid growth of the kurtosis towards the centre .",
    "as demonstrated by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) , the profile of the phase - space density @xmath143 in dm haloes is well fitted by a power - law function .",
    "it seems that the status of this relation is as well established as the nfw fit of the density profile .",
    "we checked that @xmath144 profiles inferred from the df model with parameters adjusted to the median anisotropy ( see section 5 ) coincide well with the corresponding power - law functions ( see fig .",
    "[ q_profile ] ) . in this comparison",
    "we assumed the logarithmic slopes of @xmath145 ( in the case of the dispersion of the radial velocity ) and @xmath146 ( in the case of the total dispersion ) , the values obtained from the simulations by dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) .",
    "the relative residuals of both @xmath144 profiles are of the same order as the scatter of points from the simulations in fig .  1 of dehnen & mclaughlin ( 2005 ) .",
    "note that this happens when the df model is tuned to the mean trend of the @xmath84 parameter .",
    "therefore one could suspect that both relations , the mean profile of the anisotropy and @xmath147 , are two aspects of some deeper relation .",
    "a more general parametrization of the df might provide some insights towards a more fundamental understanding of this phenomenon .",
    "although the whole analysis presented in this paper was done in the framework of the nfw density profile , the equations for the numerical inversion ( [ inv_final ] ) were derived for an arbitrary density distribution . using this general form one can immediately obtain a family of dfs with our general anisotropy profiles for any potential - density pair .",
    "for the commonly used density profiles it is easy to introduce the phase space units analogous to @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 in our case .",
    "this reduces the role of the parameters of the density profile to scaling properties so that the final df model would not explicitly depend on them .",
    "given our very general parametrization of the @xmath84 profile , our df model is expected to provide some impact on the solution of the classical problem of mass - anisotropy degeneracy for spherical systems . in order to obtain more reliable estimates of mass profiles",
    ", one could assume the anisotropy profile from the simulation and keep the density profile as the only degree of freedom of the df .",
    "one could then apply the maximum likelihood approach of projected df , as described e.g. by mahdavi & geller ( 2004 ) .",
    "a more advanced and simulation - independent approach would be to treat the anisotropy profile as an unknown quantity , described by the three parameters introduced in our formulation . as a result one would obtain an estimate of the mass profile as well as anisotropy .",
    "both methods require an additional study of the df in projection and extensive tests on mock data sets",
