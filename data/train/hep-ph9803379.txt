    "( 1 ) can be obviously rewritten as @xmath4 \\;,\\ ] ] where the two integrals represent the absorption cross sections of a three - quark and of a two - quark system respectively .    in the present note",
    "we show that in the case of collisions among two light nuclei similar expressions hold to a very high accuracy , accounting in fact for the contributions of interference terms , loop diagrams , etc . the processes which we consider are nuclear reactions with stripping of one or few nucleons and we compute the corresponding integrated cross sections and the average number of interacting nucleons .",
    "the main tools of our analysis are the multiple scattering theory ( glauber theory ) and the agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "we study first the case of tritium - deuteron ( @xmath5 ) interaction and we discuss afterwards how the results are generalized to the case of heavier nuclei .",
    "the region of validity of the present analysis is the energy region where the multiple scattering theory is available , namely from a few hundred mev per nucleon to superhigh energies , where inelastic screening corrections have to be taken into account .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions .",
    "the simplest nuclear target is deuteron",
    ". one can therefore start considering the elastic scattering amplitude , or the total cross section , for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath5 interactions .",
    "the multiple scattering theory diagrams for the processes are shown in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 , where the interacting nucleons are represented by dots and the interactions by solid lines .",
    "non - interacting nucleons are not shown .",
    "the number at a side of each diagram is the corresponding combinatorial factor @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the contribution of the diagram to the total cross section .",
    "the index @xmath12 in @xmath11 represents the number of interactions and the index @xmath13 allows one to distinguish between different diagrams at the same order in the number of interactions . as an example , in fig .",
    "3 the combinatorial factor @xmath10 is equal to 6 for the diagram corresponding to @xmath14 , since there are three possibilities to choose the non - interacting nucleon in tritium and two possibilities to choose the interacting nucleon in deuteron .",
    "the total cross section of two interacting nuclei is represented by the sum of all possible diagrams in the multiple scattering theory , which , by introducing the quantities @xmath15 is expressed as : @xmath16",
    "the simplest stripping process to consider is the one where one nucleon , of a fast @xmath17-nucleus , is scattered with a large transverse momentum with respect to its fermi momentum , while the two other nucleons are spectators .",
    "from the point of view of the unitarity relation the needed intermediate states can be found when the nucleon - nucleon interaction blob , fig .",
    "4a , is cut . in the case of the cut between two interactions , as in fig .",
    "4b , the probability to find a nucleon with comparatively large transverse momentum is suppressed by the nuclear form factor",
    ".    the cross section corresponding to a given cut diagram is deternimed by the agk cutting rules @xcite which were first obtained for reggeon diagrams @xcite and later were proved for hadron - nucleus @xcite and nucleus - nucleus @xcite interactions . as an example , the cross section of the process corresponding to a cut diagram of the kind shown in fig .",
    "4a is equal to the contribution to the total cross section of the same uncut diagram ( @xmath18 in the considered case ) multiplied by the agk @xcite factor @xmath19 where @xmath12 is the number of interactions and @xmath20 the number of cut blobs . in fig .",

    "the one - cut - blob contribution to the cross section for stripping one - nucleon in tritium - deuteron interactions , in accordance with the diagrams in fig .",
    "3 and with eq . ( 6 ) , is expressed as @xmath23    a different way to produce a stripped nucleon is to cut two blobs as in fig .",
    "3 ( 2a ) . a further possibility is to cut two blobs in fig .",
    "3 ( 3a ) . in this last case one needs however to include an additional factor 1/3 since only one combination out of the possible three gives the needed state . after accounting for all factors , the contribution of the two - cut - blob terms to the one - nucleon stripping cross section in tritium - deuteron reactions",
    "is written as @xmath24    all other possible cuts of the multiple scattering theory diagrams give more than one stripped nucleon . the total cross section for one - nucleon - stripping reactions , @xmath25 ,",
    "is therefore equal to the sum @xmath26 which can be written as @xmath27 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the total inelastic @xmath5 and @xmath9 cross sections can be expressed in the form @xcite ( also see below ) : @xmath28 the values of @xmath29 are different in @xmath5 and in @xmath9 interactions .",
    "one may however notice that the value of each @xmath11 , in @xmath5 interactions , is determined by the nucleon - nucleon cross section parameters and by the radii of tritium and deuteron , which are present in the result with coefficients depending on the kind of diagram considered .",
    "if one forces one of the terms @xmath11 to be the same in @xmath5 and in @xmath9 interactions , by rescaling for example the deuteron radius , all other terms @xmath11 , when rescaled in the same way , are therefore also forced to coincide .",
    "one can then compute the @xmath9 process in multiple scattering theory by changing the radius of the projectile deuteron in such a way as to obtain equal values for all @xmath11 in @xmath5 and in @xmath9 reactions .",
    "obviously one can not compare the value of @xmath30 which is obtained in this way with the experimental value .",
    "the expression of @xmath30 , that one obtains with this procedure , allows however one to write in a rather compact form the stripping cross section in terms of the difference @xmath31 . as a consequence of the cancellation between many of the terms appearing in @xmath32 and in @xmath30 one",
    "can in fact write @xmath33 which is precisely one third of @xmath25 as expressed in eq.(9 ) : @xmath34",
    "the cross section @xmath35 , for stripping two nucleons of tritium , in @xmath5 interaction , can be computed analogously to the computation of @xmath25 in the previous paragraph . in the process",
    "the @xmath17-nucleus dissociates into one spectator nucleon and two nucleons with transverse momentum large as compared with their fermi momentum .",
    "the cuts to be taken into account in the multiple scattering theory diagrams are those involving two tritium nucleons .",
    "one obtains : @xmath36    analogously to the case discussed in the previous sect .",
    ", one has to keep into account also of the contribution where the two stripped nucleons are originated in processes where three or more interaction blobs are cut .",
    "the simplest example is the diagram in fig .",
    "the contribution to @xmath35 from three cut blobs is equal to @xmath37 in a similar way the contribution from four cut blobs is : @xmath38    the expression of the sum of all contributions , where two tritium nucleons are stripped in @xmath5 interaction , @xmath39 , is therefore @xmath40 \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as for @xmath25 in the previous paragraph , by making use of eq .",
    "( 10 ) one obtains @xmath41",
    "the cross section of the process where all the three tritium - nucleons are scattered with a transverse momentum larger with respect to their fermi momentum , @xmath42 , can be calculated analogously : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 which can be written in the form @xmath48",
    "the equations derived in the previous paragraphs are of rather general validity in multiple scattering theory .",
    "one has therefore the possibility to test a few well known relations which are widely used in nucleus - nucleus interactions .",
    "the total inelastic tritium - deuteron cross section is equal to the sum of @xmath25 , @xmath35 and @xmath42 . by using the explicit expressions in eq.s ( 9 ) , ( 16 ) and ( 22 ) one can write :",
    "@xmath49 which , recalling the definition of @xmath29 in eq.(4 ) , shows that eq . ( 10 ) is an exact relation in multiple scattering theory .",
    "a similar conclusion holds for the average number of interacting nucleons of the incident tritium nucleus , @xmath50 .",
    "to obtain the average number one in fact writes @xmath51 and , after substituting the explicit expressions of @xmath25 , @xmath35 and @xmath42 , one obtains @xmath52 in agreement with the general expression of @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "we have performed analogous calculations in the case of interactions among various different pairs of light nuclei ( @xmath53 ) . in all cases",
    "the results are the same , namely they are of the kind of eqs .",
    "( 12 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 23 ) . the cross sections for stripping one , two , three , etc .",
    "nucleons from nucleus @xmath54 , in collisions among the two nuclei @xmath54 and @xmath55 , are written as @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 with an obvious generalization to the case where the number of stripped nucleons is larger than three .",
    "as in the case of tritium , previously discussed , in the expressions above the inelastic cross sections have to be computed by taking , for the nuclei with atomic mass number @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the same radius as for the nucleus with atomic mass number @xmath54 .",
    "we have also checked that the expression giving the average number of interacting nucleons of the projectile nucleus @xmath54 , actually @xcite @xmath62 is exact at all orders in multiple scattering theory .",
    "by making use of the agk cutting rules we have computed the stripping cross sections in collisions involving light nuclei .",
    "the expressions which we have obtained can be formally written in a compact way as differences between total inelastic cross sections of reactions where the projectile nuclei differ in the atomic mass number .",
    "the total inelastic cross sections , which are used to express the stripping cross sections , are not the experimental quantities .",
    "they represent formal expressions to be evaluated in multiple scattering theory , by using the same value of nuclear radius for the different projectile nuclei .",
    "all stripping cross sections , in interactions among light nuclei , are therefore written in a convenient way as combinations of the same quantities , which are easily computed in the multiple scattering theory formalism .",
    "multiple scattering theory and the agk cutting rules allow therefore one fix the normalization of the spectra of the stripped nucleons .",
    "the normalization in fact is not a minor problem @xcite , because of the difficulty of constructing explicitly the ortonormal set of scattering states of a process where various different scattering channels and bound states are present . which is precisely the case of the stripping reactions .",
    "one in fact obtains a non - trivial link between the different stripping cross sections , namely the relations ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) and ( 29 ) .",
    "some numerically small corrections to all our results can appear from the contributions of cuts between nucleon - nucleon interaction blobs , as shown in fig .",
    "4b , see discussion in sect .",
    "one has also to point out that , as one can see from eq .",
    "( 24 ) , the numerically small cross section of `` stripping zero nucleon '' , i.e. of the process @xmath63 , is not included into @xmath64 .",
    "we finally remark that , while the expressions which we have worked out refer to the stripping cross sections , our approach can be easily generizable to reactions of different kind , as for example pion production and drell - yan pair production .      this work is supported in part by intas grant 93 - 0079 and by the italian ministry of university and of scientific and technological research , by means of the fondi per la ricerca scientifica - universit di trieste .",
