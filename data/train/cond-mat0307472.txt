    "after controversial experimental results on the nature of ionic criticality @xcite the studies of critical phenomena in ionic fluids received a fresh impetus , and over the last decade substantial progress has been made @xcite .",
    "however , a complete thermodynamic description of electrolyte systems is still unavailable .",
    "the simplest and most frequently employed model system for both theoretical and monte carlo investigations of coulombic systems is the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , which is a gas of equisized hard - sphere ions carrying positive and negative charges of equal magnitude . from the theoretical point of view , a reasonable description of the rpm in the critical region has been obtained at a mean - field level using integral equations approach @xcite and debye - hckel theory @xcite . while theoretical predictions of the critical parameters @xcite agree reasonably well with those obtained in computer simulations @xcite , recent monte carlo investigations of ionic systems indicate a non - classical ising - like asymptotic critical behavior @xcite .",
    "moreover , predictions of different mean - field theories for charge- and size - asymmetric primitive systems differ significantly from each other @xcite . in the absence of real experimental data ,",
    "numerical simulations provide an important criterion for testing different theoretical methods @xcite .    in recent years , a new theoretical approach to study the thermodynamics and criticality of coulomb systems based on the investigation of corresponding lattice models , has been introduced @xcite .",
    "being obviously less realistic than their continuous - space counterparts , lattice models are much easier to handle analytically , and the information they provide is crucial for understanding the physics of criticality .",
    "moreover , finely discretized lattices with lattice spacing several times smaller than the ion size present substantial computational advantages over continuous space simulations , while producing almost identical critical parameters and phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "by contrast , when the ionic diameter is equal to the spacing of the underlying lattice , the phase diagram is drastically different .",
    "the symmetry of simple cubic or body - centered cubic lattices allows for unequal charge distribution between two identical sublattices , yielding an ordered structure similar to an ionic crystal .",
    "the competition between electrostatic interactions of the two charged sublattices and the entropy of charge separation leads then to order - disorder phase transitions and a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of the lattice restricted primitive model ( lrpm ) based on the debye - hckel approach has shown that , in accordance with monte carlo simulations , a coulombic - governed gas - liquid phase transitions seen in continuum electrolytes is totally suppressed on simple cubic and body - centered cubic lattices due to the formation of the thermodynamically more stable charge - ordered phase @xcite .",
    "ciach and stell @xcite argued that , unlike non - ionic fluids , in charged systems the most important are short - range fluctuations .",
    "consequently , they studied a lrpm supplemented with additional short - range interactions between ions and concluded that at some strength of the short - range attraction both the normal critical and tricritical point can become thermodynamically stable @xcite .",
    "this leads to complex phase diagrams with two distinct phase transitions , one between gas and disordered liquid phase , and another one between disordered liquid and a charge ordered phase .",
    "recent monte carlo studies have confirmed qualitatively most of these theoretical predictions but further investigations are required @xcite .    at low dimensions coulombic interactions are stronger than in three - dimensional systems , and the possibility for gas - liquid phase transitions increases .",
    "this idea has been used recently in the investigation of anisotropic lattice models of electrolytes using debye - hckel method @xcite . in this",
    "study the anisotropy mimicked the lowering of the spatial dimensionality .",
    "it has been found , that for strongly anisotropic lattices gas - liquid phase coexistence is restored .",
    "however , this theory neglects an ion clustering phenomena , which are important in charged particles systems @xcite .",
    "thus these theoretical predictions should be tested by computer simulations .",
    "current monte carlo studies of lattice rpm in @xmath3 dimensions employ the continuous space @xmath0 potential @xcite . however , because of the discrete lattice symmetry , the correct lattice coulomb potential differs from @xmath0 at short distances and approaches it asymptotically at large distances .",
    "this raises the question of how using the correct electrostatic interactions will affect the thermodynamics and critical behavior of ionic systems .",
    "indeed , the lattice correction to @xmath0 potential decays rapidly with distance and thus it can be viewed in a sense as an additional short - range interaction . in order to understand correctly the underlying mechanisms of phase transitions in coulombic systems , lattice models should be investigated with the corresponding lattice potentials .",
    "in this paper we study the rpm on tetragonal lattices using grand canonical monte carlo simulations and histogram reweighting technique @xcite .",
    "the correct lattice coulomb potential is used and an ewald - like summation is utilized to account for the long - range nature of electrostatic interactions .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii the details of the model and simulation method are given .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "iii , and summary and conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "iv . analytical expressions and the details of lattice potential calculations are given in appendix .",
    "the system we have studied consists of @xmath4 ions , half of them carrying charge @xmath5 and half @xmath6 , positioned on a simple tetragonal lattice with lattice parameters ratio ( degree of anisotropy ) @xmath7 .",
    "the pairwise interaction potential of two ions separated by distance @xmath8 has the form ( for details see appendix a ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the dielectric constant of the structureless solvent .",
    "reduced quantities are obtained by scaling with the energy of the strongest ion - ion interaction in two neighboring @xmath11 planes in the continuum limit , @xmath12 , and the unit cell volume , @xmath13 , namely , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the volume of the system .",
    "since the coulomb potential is long ranged , one needs to account for interactions with particles in all images of the periodic box used in the simulations . in the case of continuous - space @xmath0 interactions",
    "the standard method to achieve this is the ewald summation ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "however , no similar method is available for the lattice coulomb potential . therefore",
    ", we propose the following approximate scheme , which is based on the asymptotic properties of the anisotropic lattice potential ( [ fiofr ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that the potential ( [ fiofr ] ) for finite @xmath16 at large distances behaves as @xmath17 for this potential , an ewald - like sum can be constructed along the lines of the derivation in ref.@xcite , which yields the `` continuum '' part of the energy of interactions of periodic system of @xmath4 particles @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the complimentary error function . here conducting boundary conditions have been utilized , which are less sensitive to finite - size effects @xcite . as usual , the real - space damping parameter @xmath23 must be chosen in a such way that all sums in ( [ ewald ] ) converge fast . in our simulations we used @xmath24 , and the fourier - space sums",
    "were restricted to 518 wave vectors .",
    "the difference between the correct lattice potential ( [ fiofr ] ) and its asymptotic limit ( [ asympt ] ) decays rapidly with distance : see table 1 .",
    "therefore , to obtain the total energy of electrostatic interactions , the lattice correction is added for ions in elliptic shells up to certain distance , @xmath25    .dimensionless lattice coulomb potential @xmath26 ( [ fiofr ] ) and its asymptotic limit @xmath27 given by eq.([asympt ] ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we performed grand canonical monte carlo simulations on cubic boxes of length @xmath28 stretched in @xmath29 direction by a factor of @xmath16 , under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "distance - biased algorithm was employed for insertions and removals of pairs of unlike ions at each time step in order to facilitate acceptance , following ref.@xcite . to analyze the simulation data and obtain the coexistence curves , multi - histogram reweighting techniques",
    "@xcite have been used .",
    "to reduce possible finite - size effects , we used a system size @xmath30 for the isotropic lattice ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for stronger anisotropies .",
    "short initial runs were used to get a rough estimate of the location of the tricritical point .",
    "after that , typical runs involved @xmath34 monte carlo steps for equilibration and @xmath35 for production . we did not try to locate the second order transitions nel line and restricted ourselves with obtaining approximate location of the tricritical point by simple linear extrapolation of the coexistence lines , as expected for @xmath3 tricriticality .    in order to separate the effect of using the correct lattice potential in simulations",
    ", we studied first the phase coexistence in lrpm on a simple cubic lattice : see fig.1 . on a simple cubic lattice , coulomb gas with @xmath0 potential",
    "is known to phase separate , with two coexisting phases being a low - density disordered phase and an ordered high - density ionic crystal - like phase @xcite .",
    "the tricritical parameters estimates for the system size @xmath36 , obtained by panagiotopoulos and kumar @xcite , are @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "for the same system size , taking into account the lattice correction to the potential yields @xmath38 with the same accuracy .",
    "thus the tricritical density remains the same within the error limits , but the temperature increases by the factor of @xmath39 .",
    "qualitatively , the increase in the tricritical temperature should be expected since lattice coulomb interactions are stronger than @xmath0 at short distances , which leads to a higher stability of dense phases . nevertheless , the tricritical point is still significantly lower ( by 50% ) than the predictions of the debye - hckel theory of lattice electrolytes @xmath40 @xcite , but is about 20% higher than the results @xmath41 from the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) of lrpm by brognara et al.@xcite , who also used the correct form of potential in their calculations .",
    "note , that both of these theories agree on the tricritical density to be @xmath42 , which is about 20% lower than our simulation results .",
    "however , while taking into account bjerrum pairing of ions into neutral dipoles @xcite in debye - hckel approach would supposedly produce better results by shifting the phase coexistence to lower temperatures and higher densities , the predictions of the hrt seem to be final .",
    "the phase coexistence for different degrees of anisotropy @xmath16 is shown in fig.1 . at any @xmath16",
    ", the system shows only order - disorder phase separations and a tricritical point .",
    "thus , the effect of stretching the lattice amounts merely to altering the tricritical point location , without changing qualitatively the topology of the phase diagram .",
    "this goes in contrast with the recent theory based on debye - hckel calculations @xcite which predicts that at the lattice parameters ratio @xmath43 a distinct gas - liquid phase coexistence may reappear .",
    "however , as was mentioned above , the theoretical approach of ref.@xcite disregards the bjerrum pairing @xcite , or , more generally , clustering of ions , which is crucial for the thermodynamics of the gas - liquid transition in electrolytes .",
    "typically , taking into account pairing somewhat diminishes the critical temperature but significantly increases the critical density @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , taking into consideration the ion clustering is unlikely to change the topology of the phase diagram of lrpm on the isotropic lattice .",
    "however , since the strength of the electrostatic interactions increases with anisotropy , this may lead to more profound tendency of ions to bind into neutral dipoles / clusters ( mostly , in @xmath11-planes ) , producing eventually a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transitions @xcite line at infinite stretching .",
    "stronger pairing then could shift the gas - liquid coexistence curve much further than in the isotropic case , again putting it completely inside the order - disorder phase envelope .",
    "it should be noted that simulations of the two - dimensional lattice coulomb gas @xcite also reveal no normal first order gas - liquid transition , but only an order - disorder phase separations @xcite .",
    "tricritical temperature and density as functions of the lattice parameters ratio @xmath16 are presented in fig.2 . as anisotropy increases , both tricritical temperature and density increase",
    "physical account of this behavior follows from the properties of the lattice coulomb potential . indeed , in @xmath29-direction lattice potential ( [ fiofr ] ) behaves almost as @xmath44 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , in crystallographic directions different from @xmath45 $ ] , the anisotropic lattice potential is much stronger than @xmath0 and decays slower .",
    "while the interactions in @xmath29-direction almost do not change with @xmath16 , stronger anisotropy brings stronger interactions inside the @xmath11-layers .",
    "this becomes especially important at large densities , where the average distance between ions is of the order of the lattice spacing .",
    "therefore , the average energy per particle increases with anisotropy . as a consequence , higher temperatures are required for fluctuations to achieve a critical level , and the tricritical temperature grows . at the same time , more intensive interactions between ions lead to more active clustering . the free charges density , and hence the electrostatic part of the free energy diminishes significantly .",
    "however , the entropic part of the energy remains the same .",
    "therefore , electrostatic interactions of two charged sublattices become comparable with the entropy of charge separation at higher overall densities , and the coexistence shifts to denser phases .",
    "the trend for tricritical temperature and density to increase with anisotropy is correctly reproduced by the debye - hckel treatment of anisotropic lattices @xcite : see fig.2 . however , the quantitative agreement between theoretical predictions and simulations is not very good .",
    "while the theory predicts only a few percent increase in density at large lattice stretching , our simulations showed more significant growth .",
    "for the tricritical temperature , on the contrary , simulations yield a somewhat smaller slope .    at large stretching",
    ", increasing interactions inside @xmath11-planes result in lesser relative importance of interactions between ions with different @xmath29 coordinates . at some point ,",
    "interactions with ions in the same layer start dominating , and the @xmath46 system becomes quasi-@xmath47 . since different layers become uncoupled , due to its probabilistic nature phase separation in each of them takes place at different values of the chemical potential , and one may have configurations with gas phase in some of the layers and high - density ordered phase in the others , which prevents reliable sampling of the system . at @xmath16=10 , it turned to be impossible to obtain a reliable phase separation in a periodic system of more than one layer in @xmath29-direction : at high densities the system would not equilibrate after more than @xmath48 monte carlo steps .    to this end , for @xmath49 we carried out simulations of the system consisting of only _ one _ plane , that is , square box with @xmath50 periodic in @xmath51 and @xmath52 directions , with the potential ( [ fiofr ] ) . using only one layer in simulations yielded a highly asymmetric phase coexistence very similar to that obtained by teitel for coulomb gas on two - dimensional square lattice @xcite , with the tricritical point located at @xmath53 : see fig.1 .",
    "but in two dimensions , the coefficient in the laplace equation ( [ poisson ] ) is not @xmath54 but @xmath55 .",
    "since all our simulations were done with three - dimensional potential , the temperature at large anisotropies must be divided by 2 to obtain the correct @xmath47 limit , while the density should remain intact .",
    "this yields @xmath56 which exactly coincides with the values obtained by teitel .",
    "it should be also noted that parts of the coexistence curve for @xmath49 at intermediate densities lay below the corresponding curve for @xmath57 .",
    "however , for the latter case in contrast to @xmath49 , the interactions between layers are still very important and add significantly to the total free energy of the system : simulations of periodic system of only one layer produce much lower coexistence curve .",
    "therefore , although at equal densities the energy of ions interactions inside a single layer for @xmath57 is less than for @xmath49 , the total energy density may be higher because of the interactions between layers , and hence the temperature of phase separations would also be higher .",
    "however , this is not essential at very low or high densities where the interactions inside layers dominate anyway . taking into account the influence of layers on each other at @xmath49",
    "probably would eliminate this intersection of the coexistence curves .",
    "nevertheless , this hardly would change our estimate for the tricritical point location in the limit of infinite stretching , which , as it has been mentioned , coincides with the results by teitel for two - dimensional square lattice .    to gain further insight on the behavior of lrpm on anisotropic lattices we also performed simulations with the continuous space coulomb potential .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams for box size @xmath33 and @xmath58 are presented in fig.3 . at any fixed lattice stretching ,",
    "the phase coexistence is very similar to the case of the true lattice potential . no normal gas - liquid phase transition is found , and the phase coexistence is between a disordered low - density phase and ordered high - density phase .",
    "the tricritical temperature shows the same trend as for the correct lattice potential , increasing with the inter - layer distance .",
    "however , since for small @xmath16 the interactions are weaker now , the tricritical temperatures are lower .    the scaling of the temperature @xmath59 with @xmath60 is maintained in this paper to allow comparisons with earlier theoretical results .",
    "for the correct lattice ( or continuum ) two - dimensional potential , this is allowed as @xmath61 because the potential becomes length scale - independent at the two - dimensional limit .",
    "however , for the @xmath0 potential , using a scaling with the layer - layer energy results in a divergence of the reduced critical temperature . while for the correct lattice potential the `` natural '' scale of energy",
    "is set by layer - layer interactions whose asymptotic behavior does not change with @xmath16 ( see table 1 ) , for the @xmath0 potential this scale is given by the energy of the ion - ion interactions at contact _ inside _ a layer @xmath62 .",
    "note , however , that for actual simulations this is not important , because all what matters is the boltzmann factor , which remains the same as long as the energy and the temperature are measured in the same units .",
    "calculations with the temperature scaled by this energy @xmath63 ( where @xmath10 is the three - dimensional dielectric constant , appropriate for the @xmath0 potential ) are shown in fig .",
    "4 . with this",
    "`` natural '' scaling , the tricritical point behavior as a function of anisotropy is drastically different : the tricritical temperature _ decreases _ with anisotropy , converging to @xmath64 .",
    "the reason for this is that now increasing anisotropy is not accompanied by stronger interactions between ions . on the contrary , while interactions inside the @xmath65planes remain the same , due to a weaker coupling of the layers effective energy per particle diminishes , and so does the tricritical temperature .",
    "this decay is rather fast and the temperature saturates already at the lattice parameters ratio @xmath66 .",
    "detailed studies of ions configurations showed that at @xmath67 different @xmath65planes become totally independent of each other , and the system behaves as a quasi-@xmath47 liquid .",
    "similarly to the true lattice potential case , to obtain phase coexistence for the limit of infinite stretching ( @xmath58 ) , simulations of periodic system of only one plane were carried out with box size @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the tricritical density gradually increases from @xmath70 for isotropic lattice to @xmath71 at strong anisotropy , following the trend shown by the system with correct lattice interactions : see fig.3 .",
    "this again reflects the relative importance of clustering when one approaches the two - dimensional limit of infinite stretching .",
    "however , since the potential is now weaker , the limiting density is lower than in true lattice @xmath47 systems .",
    "in this study , grand canonical monte carlo simulations and histogram reweighting techniques have been used to investigate phase behavior of the restricted primitive model with correct lattice coulomb potential on simple cubic and tetragonal lattices .",
    "our results show that , at all degrees of anisotropy , only order - disorder phase separations and a tricritical point exist . for isotropic cubic lattice ,",
    "the effect of using the correct lattice potential shows only in the value of the tricritical temperature . as anisotropy increases , both the tricritical temperature and density increase . at large anisotropy",
    "the system undergoes a qualitative shift from a three - dimensional to two - dimensional behavior .",
    "this shift is not accompanied by any change in the phase diagram topology , and only the tricritical parameters alter . to study in detail the transition from @xmath46 to @xmath47 behavior ,",
    "further investigations are needed .",
    "in particular , its location may depend on the system size and boundary conditions used in ewald summation . for continous @xmath0 potential ,",
    "the tricritical temperature displays an opposite trend and decreases with the anisotropy .",
    "although exact values of the tricritical temperature and density can be influenced by finite size effects , an issue totally omitted in this study , their qualitative behavior seems physically plausible",
    ". it would be also useful to develop another procedure for ewald - like summation for lattice potential , which will not not rely on its asymptotic behavior .",
    "the only existing theoretical treatment of coulomb gas on anisotropic lattices based on the debye - hckel approach captures correctly the trend of the tricritical temperature and density behavior with anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , the absence of the anticipated normal gas - liquid transition suggests that with increasing anisotropy , stability of both ordered and disordered dense phases increases in a similar way , and the formation of an ordered structure remains thermodynamically more favorable than possible gas - liquid phase coexistence .",
    "taking explicitly into account the ion clustering will provide a better theoretical description of thermodynamics of ionic systems on anisotropic lattices .",
