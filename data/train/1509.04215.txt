    "quantum adiabatic processes are a powerful strategy to implement quantum state engineering , which aims at manipulating a quantum system to attain a target state at a designed time t. in the adiabatic scenario , the quantum system evolves under a sufficiently slowly - varying hamiltonian , which prevents changes in the populations of the energy eigenlevels .",
