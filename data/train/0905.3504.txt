    "the most important building block in both eberhard s as well as our proofs is a construction called a triarc .",
    "a _ triarc _ is a plane graph @xmath45 such that the boundary @xmath46 of the outer face of @xmath45 is a cycle , and moreover the following conditions are satisfied ( examples are the graphs in figure  [ 443224tr ] with the half - edges in the outer face removed ) :    * every vertex of @xmath47 has degree 3 in @xmath45 ; * @xmath46 contains distinct vertices @xmath48 of degree 2 ( called the _",
    "corners _ of the triarc ) such that the degrees ( in @xmath45 ) of the vertices on each of the three paths in @xmath49 alternate between 2 and 3 , starting and ending with a vertex of degree 2 .",
    "a _ side _ of a triarc @xmath45 as above is a subpath of @xmath46 that starts and ends at distinct corners of @xmath45 and does not contain the third corner .",
    "the _ length _ of a side @xmath50 of @xmath45 is the number of inner vertices of degree 2 on @xmath50 ; note that although the corners of a triarc have degree 2 , they are not counted when calculating the lengths of its sides . a triarc with sides of lengths @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is called an _ @xmath54-triarc_. of course , we can flip or rotate such a triarc and consider it , for example , as a @xmath55-triarc .",
    "triarcs are very versatile tools .",
    "firstly , if the length of some side of a triarc @xmath45 equals the length of some side of another triarc @xmath56 , then @xmath45 and @xmath56 can be glued together along those sides to yield a new plane graph with all inner vertices having degree 3 ; see for example figure  [ fig0 ] .",
    "secondly , every triarc @xmath45 has zero total curvature ; to see this , take two copies of @xmath45 , turn one of them upside down , glue them along a common side to obtain a ` parallelogram ' ( see figure  [ fig0 ] again ) , and identify opposite sides of this parallelogram to obtain a graph embeddable in the torus .",
    "but perhaps the most important property of triarcs is the possibility to ` glue ' them together to obtain larger triarcs ; we describe this operation below .",

    ", we identify a corner ( and an incident edge ) of the first triarc with a corner ( and an edge ) of the second triarc see figure  [ glueing57] so that the two identified corners yield a vertex of degree  3 on a side of length @xmath62 in a new triarc .",
    "then , we can add a _",
    "`` parallelogram '' _ consisting of hexagons to obtain an @xmath61-triarc .",
    "however , we do not want to add hexagons . instead",
    ", we decompose the parallelogram into tiles each consisting of four hexagons as depicted in figure  [ glueing57 ] , and replace each of these tiles by two pentagons and two heptagons as indicated in figure  [ 2x2tile ] . the `` tile '' on the right of figure  [ 2x2tile ]",
    "will be used several times in the sequel , and we shall refer to it as a _",
    "h - tile_.    we are going to use this operation of glueing two triarcs into a larger one several times in the following section .",
    "we are ready to state and prove our main result .",
    "let us observe that , unlike eberhard s theorem , we do not need to assume that the given face - sizes form a plausible sequence ( although we make this assumption in the formulation of the theorem ) because given a sequence @xmath33 , the sequence can always be appended by appropriate values @xmath23 and @xmath24 to become plausible .    [ ebe57 ]",
    "let @xmath63 be a plausible sequence for the sphere . then there exist infinitely many integers @xmath64 such that the sequence + @xmath65 is realizable in the sphere .",
    "we will give an explicit construction of a cubic graph embeddable in the sphere whose face sequence is of the form @xmath65 .",
    "the rough plan for this is as follows . for each face imposed by the sequence @xmath42",
    ", we create a _ basic triarc _ containing this face as well as some pentagons and heptagons .",
    "then , we glue all these triarcs together and extend to a triarc with sides of suitable lengths . finally , we construct a new triarc having the same side lengths , and glue these two triarcs together ( as explained later ) to obtain the desired graph embedded in the sphere .    to construct a basic triarc for a @xmath4-gon ( we will make @xmath3 copies of it ) , we surround the @xmath4-gon by three heptagons and @xmath66 pentagons as shown in the right half of figure  [ 443224tr ] ( where the @xmath4-gon we are surrounding happens to be a pentagon ) .",
    "note that we can always make the basic triarc isosceles with the equal sides having even length .",
    "we call the @xmath4-gon we started with the _ nucleus _ of this triarc .",
    "having constructed all basic triarcs , our next step is to glue them all together to obtain a single triarc @xmath45 containing them all .",
    "we do so recursively , attaching one basic triarc at a time as shown in figure  [ glueing57 ] , where we use many copies of the h - tile  in order to build the parallelogram needed .",
    "each time we use this glueing operation we are assuming that both triarcs in figure  [ glueing57 ] are isosceles , with the equal sides having even length , and align them so that the two equal even sides are the upper left and upper right side .",
    "note that the resulting triarc is also isosceles with two equal sides of even length .",
    "thus , we can continue recursively to glue all basic triarcs into one isosceles triarc @xmath45 .",
    "our next aim is to enlarge @xmath45 into an equilateral triarc @xmath67 with sides of length @xmath68 , where @xmath68 is a multiple of 8 and satisfies @xmath69 , using only pentagons and heptagons . to this end",
    ", we will use the glueing operation of figure  [ glueing57 ] and many copies of a @xmath70-triarc and a @xmath71-triarc .",
    "figure  [ 443224tr ] shows how to construct those triarcs with pentagons and heptagons only .",
    "-triarc and a @xmath71-triarc.,width=377 ]    note that glueing @xmath67 with a @xmath70-triarc ( as in figure  [ glueing57 ] ) keeps it isosceles and decreases the difference of lengths between the `` base '' and the other two sides by 1 , while glueing with a @xmath71-triarc increases that difference by 2 .",
    "thus , recursively glueing with such triarcs we can enlarge @xmath45 into an equilateral triarc @xmath34 with sides of even length .",
    "moreover , using the glueing operation of figure  [ glueing57 ] three times , once with a @xmath71-triarc and twice with a @xmath70-triarc , we can increase the side - lengths by @xmath72 .",
    "thus we can increase the length of each side of @xmath34 by 10 . since @xmath73 , we can use this operation to enlarge @xmath34 into an equilateral triarc @xmath74 with even sides of length @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , since performing this operation three times increases the length of each side by 30 , and @xmath76 , we can enlarge @xmath74 into an equilateral triarc @xmath67 with the length of each side being a multiple of @xmath77 and congruent to @xmath78 modulo @xmath79 .",
    "next , we are going to construct a triarc @xmath56 that has the same side lengths as @xmath67 but consists of pentagons and heptagons only . by glueing together a @xmath71-triarc , a @xmath80-triarc and a @xmath81-triarc ( that is , the same triarc in three different rotations ) we get an @xmath82-triarc , which we will call  @xmath83 .",
    "since the sides of @xmath67 have length a multiple of 8 , by glueing copies of @xmath83 together recursively as in figure  [ glueing57 ] we can indeed construct a triarc  @xmath56 that has the same dimensions as @xmath67 .",
    "we can now combine @xmath56 and @xmath67 together to produce a cubic graph tiling the sphere as shown in figure  [ cyl57 ] . by construction",
    ", this graph has for every @xmath84 precisely @xmath3 faces of size @xmath4 , and moreover it has at least @xmath23 pentagons and at least @xmath24 heptagons .",
    "thus its face sequence is of the form @xmath85 for some @xmath86 .",
    "since both @xmath42 and @xmath85 satisfy euler s formula ( the former by assumption , the latter because the plane graph we just constructed implements it ) , we have @xmath87 .",
    "this completes the construction and shows the existence of one particular value of @xmath68 as desired . however , observe that the construction of @xmath67 and @xmath56 allows us to make the side lengths of these triarcs arbitrarily large .",
    "this shows that we can get examples for infinitely many values of @xmath68 and thus completes the proof .",
    "we now turn from planar graphs to maps on arbitrary ( compact ) surfaces .",
    "map _ on a surface @xmath34 is a graph together with a 2-cell embedding in @xmath34 .",
    "a map is _ polyhedral _",
    "if all faces are closed disks in the surface and the intersection of any two faces is either empty , a common vertex or a common edge .",
    "if the graph of the map is cubic , then we say that the map is _",
    "simple_.    a cycle contained in the graph of a map is _ contractible _ if it bounds a disk on the surface .",
    "the _ edge - width _ of a map @xmath88 is the length of a shortest non - contractible cycle in @xmath88 .",
    "the _ face - width _ of @xmath88 is the minimum number of faces , the union of whose boundaries contains a non - contractible cycle .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more about the basic properties and the importance of these parameters of maps . at this point",
    "we only note that a map is polyhedral if and only if its graph is 3-connected and its face - width is at least three , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  5.5.12 ) .",
    "we also note that if @xmath89 is the largest size of a face of @xmath88 , then the edge - width of @xmath88 can not exceed @xmath90 times the face - width of @xmath88 .",
    "we now restate and prove our main result , theorem  [ thintro ] .",
    "[ cor ] let @xmath33 be a sequence of non - negative integers , let @xmath34 be a closed surface , and let @xmath35 be a positive integer .",
    "then there exist infinitely many pairs of integers @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that the sequence @xmath91 is realizable in @xmath34 and there is  a 3-connected realizing cubic map of face - width at least @xmath35 .",
    "let us first describe a construction that does not necessarily achieve the desired face - width ; we will later explain how to modify this construction in order to get large face - width .",
    "the rough sketch of this construction is as follows .",
    "firstly , we increase the number of hexagons in the sequence @xmath15 to @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the number of handles of @xmath34 and @xmath53 the number of its crosscaps ( by the surface classification theorem we may assume that one of @xmath94 is zero , but we do not have to ) .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ ebe57 ] that we can increase the numbers @xmath23 and @xmath24 of this sequence to some appropriate values so that the resulting sequence @xmath95 is realized by a map on the sphere .",
    "we will then use the @xmath96 auxilliary hexagons of this map we added above to introduce some handles and/or crosscaps .",
    "after doing so , all auxilliary hexagons will have disappeared , and we obtain a map on @xmath34 whose sequence of faces differs from @xmath15 by some pentagons and heptagons only .",
    "more precisely , similarly to the proof of theorem  [ ebe57 ] , we construct a basic triarc for each face in @xmath95 , but with one modification : for each hexagon we construct a triarc like the one in figure  [ newhex ] ( on the left ) rather than one with two even sides of equal lengths ( in fact , we need this modification for the auxiliary hexagons only , but we might as well use it for the original hexagons in @xmath42 as well ) .        next , we proceed as in theorem  [ ebe57 ] to glue all basic triarcs together into one triarc @xmath45 . however , since we now have basic triarcs with all sides odd ( the ones of figure  [ newhex ] ) , the glueing operation of figure  [ glueing57 ] will not work for these triarcs . for this reason",
    ", we first extend each such triarc into an equilateral triarc with even sides using three copies of the @xmath71-triarc of figure  [ 443224tr ] as shown in figure  [ newhex ] ( right ) .",
    "consists of the dashed and the thick edges.,width=188 ]    we continue imitating the proof of theorem  [ ebe57 ] to obtain a cubic graph @xmath97 embedded in a homeomorphic copy @xmath74 of the sphere that contains all basic triarcs .",
    "we will now perform some cutting and glueing operations on both @xmath74 and @xmath97 to obtain a new surface , homeomorphic to @xmath34 , with a cubic graph @xmath98 embedded in it .",
    "suppose that @xmath99 .",
    "then , pick @xmath93 pairs @xmath100 of hexagonal faces of @xmath97 , such that all the faces @xmath101 and @xmath102 are distinct ( there are enough hexagonal faces by our choice of the sequence @xmath95 ) .",
    "now for each pair @xmath103 perform the following operations .",
    "cut out the two discs of @xmath74 corresponding to @xmath104 , and glue their boundaries together with a half - twist ; that is , each vertex of the boundary of @xmath101 is identified with the midpoint of an edge of @xmath102 and vice - versa .",
    "this operation creates a handle in @xmath74 , and the embedded graph remains cubic ; however , it also gives rise to some unwanted faces : the size of each face that was incident to @xmath101 or @xmath102 has now been increased by 1 .",
    "we thus have the situation depicted in figure  [ handle ] , where @xmath46 is the cycle of length 12 resulting from the boundaries of @xmath101 and @xmath102 . recall that since every hexagon is put in a basic triarc like the one in figure  [ newhex ] , the sizes of the faces on each side of @xmath46 alternate between 6 and 8 as shown in figure  [ handle ] .",
    "but now , contracting and uncontracting each of the three thick edges ( in the way explained in figure  [ 2x2tile ] ) turns each of the faces incident with @xmath46 into a heptagon .        on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath105 , then pick @xmath53 distinct hexagonal faces @xmath106 , and for every @xmath107 cut out the disc corresponding to @xmath101 and glue in its place the outside of the hexagon of figure  [ crosscap ] with a half twist .",
    "each such operation gives rise to a new crosscap , but also to unwanted faces just like in figure  [ handle ] .",
    "but again , contracting and uncontracting each of the three thick edges we can turn all these unwanted hexagons and octagons into heptagons .",
    "thus , after all these operations have been completed , we obtain a surface with @xmath93 handles and @xmath53 crosscaps with a cubic graph embedded in it whose face sequence is @xmath108 for some @xmath86 .",
    "note that all auxiliary hexagons in @xmath109 have disappeared after the above operations .",
    "it is easy to check that our maps are 3-connected .",
    "indeed , our `` building blocks ''  the basic triarcs and the triarcs of figure  [ 443224tr ]  are 3-connected after suppressing the degree  2 vertices .",
    "this property is also true for triarcs in figure  [ newhex ] , and it is maintained by the glueing operation of figure  [ glueing57 ] . by glueing two triarcs along a `` circumference '' , using the ring in figure  [ cyl57 ] ,",
    "we get a 3-connected graph .",
    "the gadget we used for introducing cross - caps ( figure  [ crosscap ] ) is 3-connected , and it is not hard to see that we maintain 3-connectivity when adding this gadget or when creating a handle as depicted in figure  [ handle ] .",
    "it remains to discuss how to modify this construction to obtain maps with arbitrarily large face - width . by the remark preceding corollary [ cor ]",
    ", it suffices to construct maps with arbitrarily large edge - width @xmath110 since the face sizes are bounded from above by @xmath89 .",
    "this is achieved as follows .",
    "first of all , we make every basic triarc used in the construction large enough that the distance from its nucleus to the boundary of the triarc is at least @xmath110 and the length of each side of each triarc is at least @xmath111 .",
    "this can be achieved by the method we used in the proof of theorem  [ ebe57 ] to enlarge @xmath45 into an equilateral triarc @xmath67 . to the boundary of the triarc",
    "is at least @xmath110 and the length of each side of each triarc is at least @xmath111 . to achieve this",
    ", we first glue the triarc with several @xmath71-triarcs ( or any other triarcs ) both on the left and on the right , to obtain a large triarc with the nucleus in the middle of the bottom side .",
    "then we possibly glue it with a @xmath70-triarc to create a triarc with all sides even .",
    "finally , we rotate the triarc by @xmath112 and perform more glueing with @xmath71-triarcs to get the nucleus away from the boundary .",
    "( the notions `` left '' , `` right '' , and `` @xmath112 '' in this paragraph refer to the glueing operation of fig .",
    "[ glueing57 ] . )",
    "next , we replace the auxiliary hexagons used in order to add handles and crosscaps with @xmath113-gons , where @xmath114 is odd and greater than @xmath115 .",
    "of course , this will force us to add some more pentagons to our sequence @xmath3 to make it plausible . note that we can generalize the triarc on the left of figure  [ newhex ] so that the inner 6-gon is replaced by a @xmath113-gon surrounded by three heptagons and @xmath116 pentagons , arranged in a symmetric way so that any two heptagons separate @xmath117 pentagons from the rest .",
    "we will make use of the fact that @xmath117 is odd .",
    "we need to adapt the right half of figure  [ newhex ] as well , since the inner triarc has now grown larger . for this , note that each side of the inner triarc has now length @xmath118 , and so in order to use the method of the right half of figure  [ newhex ] the three peripheral triarcs must have a base of length @xmath119 ( in addition to having their other two sides of equal length ) .",
    "since we chose @xmath114 to be odd , it turns out that @xmath119 is a multiple of four , and so we can construct the required peripheral triarcs by glueing several @xmath71-triarcs together using figure  [ glueing57 ] into a @xmath120-triarc .",
    "moreover , the crosscap gadget shown in figure  [ crosscap ] can be generalized so that the inner 6-gon is replaced by a @xmath113-gon that is surrounded by @xmath121 heptagons and @xmath121 pentagons , arranged alternatingly around the @xmath113-gon ( here it is also important that we chose @xmath114 to be odd ) .    when the time comes to insert crosscaps or glue pairs of such @xmath113-gons together ( after a half - twist ) , we obtain a similar configuration as in figure  [ handle ] , but with @xmath121 thick edges .",
    "some of these thick edges are surrounded by faces of sizes @xmath122 ( as in figure  [ handle ] ) , while others are surrounded by four hexagons or by one octagon and three hexagons .",
    "note , however , that for parity reasons we can make sure that every octagon is incident with a thick edge , and still every fourth edge on the dashed cycle is thick .",
    "finally , the contract - uncontract operation of figure  [ 2x2tile ] turns these faces into pentagons and heptagons only .",
    "it is easy to see that these changes did not hurt 3-connectivity .",
    "let us now argue that the resulting map @xmath97 has edge - width at least @xmath110 .",
    "recall that the surface @xmath34 is obtained from a plane graph @xmath98 , embedded in the sphere , that is composed of large basic triarcs @xmath123 , some large parallelograms used to glue the basic triarcs together into a large triarc @xmath45 , and a remainder @xmath124 comprising the material we used to enlarge @xmath45 into @xmath67 , the ring of figure  [ cyl57 ] , and the triarc @xmath56 .",

    "the last type is similar to the second one : it is a cycle @xmath46 that crosses some cycle @xmath147 of @xmath97 obtained by glueing two nuclei @xmath125 , @xmath141 to introduce a handle .",
