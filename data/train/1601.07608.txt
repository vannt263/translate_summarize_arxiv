    "since the discovery of the first rocky exoplanet ( term we use here to refer to planets with masses and radii consistent with mgsio@xmath9 and fe compositions following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corot-7b @xcite , effort has been made to find and study the formation , composition and evolution of these systems , since they resemble earth in many ways .",
    "as most rocky planets are smaller in size than @xmath10 , which correspond to masses of @xmath11 @xcite , the discovery of those type of exoplanets is difficult due to the small signals that these radii and masses imply .",
    "in fact , in addition to corot-7b , only 9 planets with secure masses and radii ( i.e. , masses and radii with values more than @xmath12 away from zero ) in this rocky regime exist to date : gj1132 @xcite , kepler-36b @xcite , k2 - 3d @xcite , kepler-93b @xcite , kepler-10b @xcite , kepler-23b @xcite , kepler-20b @xcite , kepler-406b @xcite , and kepler-78b @xcite .",
    "all of these planets have radii smaller than @xmath13 , as has been empirically determined .",
    "although the sample of rocky planets is small , some interesting relationships suggest that some of these rocky planets might have common properties @xcite .",
    "perhaps one of the most interesting relations was recently introduced by @xcite which , considering the planets with radii and mass measurements measured to better than @xmath14 precision , show that the planets follow a common iso - composition curve on the mass - radius diagram , along with earth and venus .",
    "this relation was recently revised by @xcite to be a 74% rock and 26% fe composition .",
    "this suggests that these small , rocky analogs of earth might have similar compositions with small intrinsic scatter .",
    "here we report what could be a possible interesting addition to the picture of rocky worlds described above : a @xmath15 exoplanet that falls just where a pure rock ( i.e. , magnesium silicate ) composition is expected in the mass radius diagram using two - layer models .",
    "although this does not mean the planet has exactly this composition , its position on the diagram does makes it interesting due the fact that this has been used in previous works to divide the  non - rocky \" and  possibly rocky \" planets @xcite .",
    "the discovery is made in the context of a chilean based effort whose aim is to follow - up planetary candidates selected using data from the two - wheeled _ kepler _ ( k2 ) mission .",
    "k2 has proven to be very effective in the search for exoplanets , enabling a plethora of new discoveries of planets of different sizes , which are especially interesting due to the presence of several bright host stars in the sample that allow detailed follow - up characterisation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the data , which includes the k2 photometry , archival , new , adaptive optics ( ao ) and lucky imaging of the target star , along with high resolution spectra and radial velocities obtained with the harps spectrograph .",
    " 3 presents a joint analysis of the data and presents the derived parameters of the planetary system .",
    "we discuss the results in  4 and present our conclusions in  5 .",
    "k2 photometry for our target was obtained by the _ kepler _",
    "spacecraft during campaign 4 .",
    "this field was observed between february and april 2015 and the data was released on september of the same year .",
    "we obtained the decorrelated versions of all the lightcurves in the campaign which were made publicly available for download by @xcite , using the photometry with the optimal aperture , which in the case of our target star corresponded to a @xmath16 pixel radius around the target , or an aperture of @xmath17 radius .",
    "we performed a transit search using a box least squares ( bls , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) algorithm .",
    "once a periodic signal is detected along with the best - fit depth , the transit event is flagged as a pontential planetary candidate if ( 1 ) the depth is at least @xmath18 larger than the average noise level of the lightcurve ( denoted by @xmath19 ) and ( 2 ) if there are three or more transit events .",
    "initially , because of the last requirement , the lightcurve of the target star was not flagged by our transit search pipeline .",
    "however , we also performed visual inspection of all the lightcurves , revealing this interesting candidate . in order to double check that this was indeed an astrophysical signal and not a spurious signal arising from the decorrelation method used to obtain the lightcurve",
    ", we also inspected the detrended lightcurves released by the _ kepler _ team using the pdc - map algorithm @xcite , and the same signal was observed at the exact same times as the signals observed in the @xcite photometry .",
    "we were thus confident that the signal is of astrophysical origin and proceeded to analyse the light curve .",
    "a median filter with a 41 point ( @xmath20 hour ) window was used in order to further filter long - term variations of this target .",
    "the resulting median filter was smoothed using a gaussian filter with a 5-point standard - deviation , and this smoothed light curve was used to normalize the light curve . using this normalized lightcurve ,",
    "an initial fit using our transit - fitting pipeline ( see below ) revealed a @xmath21 period for this candidate and a lightcurve whose shape resembled that of a planetary transit , with a transit duration consistent with that of a planetary companion . using the parameters",
    "obtained from this initial fit , we removed outliers from the out - of - transit data , discarding any points deviating more than 3-@xmath19 from the median flux . the resulting normalized version of this lightcurve is shown on figure  [ k2lc ] .",
    "no other significant signals were found in the photometry .",
    "a high resolution spectrum of this target was taken on october 21st with the coralie spectrograph mounted on the 1.2 m euler telescope in la silla observatory in order to obtain rough spectral parameters of the stellar host , and define whether this was a giant or a dwarf star .",
    "data were reduced and analyzed using the procedures decribed in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the coralie spectra gave @xmath22 k , @xmath23 dex , @xmath24=0.0 $ ] dex and @xmath25 km / s , which revealed that the star was a dwarf solar - type star .",
    "in addition , no secondary peak was seen on the cross - correlation function indicating no detectable spectroscopic binary .",
    "because of this , the target was promoted to our list of planetary candidates despite the lack of high resolution imaging needed to rule out potential blend events .",
    "high - precision radial velocities ( rvs ) were obtained from the harps spectrograph mounted on the 3.6 m telescope at la silla between october and december of 2015 in order to measure the reflex motion of the star due to the hypothetical planet producing the transit signal .",
    "the observations covered our predicted negative and positive quadratures , along with epochs in between , in order to probe possible long - term trends in the rvs indicative of a possible massive companion .",
    "23 spectra were taken in total with the simultaneous thorium - argon mode ; the harps pipeline ( drs , version 3.8 ) was used to reduce these spectra and to obtain the ( drift - corrected ) radial velocities , which are calculated via cross - correlation with a g2v mask which is appropiate for the stellar type of the host ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "the typical precision was @xmath26 m / s for each individual rv measurement . for each spectra ,",
    "the bisector span , @xmath27-index , and the integrated flux of the h@xmath28 and lines were obtained to monitor the activity of the host star and study its influence on the rvs @xcite .",
    "the measured rvs , along with these various calculated activity indicators , are given in table  [ table : rv_list ] .",
    "although the times are given in utc , they were converted to tbd ( which is the time scale used by kepler ) for our joint analysis , which we describe in  3.2 .",

    "the natural guide star system was used and , because our target is relatively bright , it was used as the guide star .",
    "32 images with exposure times of 30 sec each were taken in five different positions of the camera ( nodding ) , all of them at different rotator offset angles .",
    "due to a motor failure of the instrument , the nodding and rotation patterns were not able to cover the full @xmath226 field of view around the star .",
    "however , it gave us enough data to rule out stars within a @xmath217 radius .",
    "we follow methods similar to those described in @xcite to reduce our images , which we briefly describe here ; a ` python ` implementation of such methods is available at github .",
    "first , the images were corrected by dark current but not flat fielded , because the flats show an uneven flux level as a result of optical distortions and not of intrinsic pixel sensitivities ( see section a.3 in * ? ? ? * for a detailed explanation of this effect ) . a bad pixel mask provided by @xcite",
    "was used in order to mask bad pixels .",
    "after these corrections are applied to each image , we obtain a median image using our 32 frames in order to get an estimate of the background flux , which we then subtract from each of the individual frames . in order to further correct for differences in the sky backgrounds of each image",
    ", we apply a 2d median filter with a 200 pixel ( @xmath227 ) window which takes care of large - scale fluctuations of each image .",
    "the background - subtracted images are then merged by first rotating them to the true north ( using the astrometric calibration described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and combined using the centroid of our target star ( obtained by fitting a 2d gaussian to the profile ) as a common reference point between the images . our resulting ao image , obtained by combining our 32 images , is shown in figure  [ ao - lucky - image ] .",
    "a 2d gaussian fit to the target star gives a fwhm of @xmath228 , which we set as our resolution limit .",
    "the limiting contrasts in our ao observations in the @xmath224 band were estimated as follows .",
    "first , a 2d gaussian fit to the target star was made and used to remove it from the image .",
    "although a 2d gaussian does not perform a perfect fit at the center , the fit is good enough for the wings of the psf , which is our aim .",
    "then , at each radial distance @xmath229fwhm away from the target star , where @xmath230 is an integer , a fake source was injected at @xmath231 different angles .",
    "sources with magnitude differences from 11 to 0 were injected in @xmath232 steps , and a detection was defined if 3 or more pixels were 5-sigma above the median flux level at that position .",

    "only one source was detected at @xmath233 from the target .",
    "the shape and position of this object is inconsistent with a speckle but is very faint : we measure a magnitude difference of @xmath234 with the target and is thus just above our contrast level at that position ( see figure  [ ao - lucky - image ] , the source is indicated with a grey circle in the upper right ) . a careful assessment of the psf shape , however , made it inconsistent with the object having the same psf shape as our star . comparing its psf with known  ghosts \" on the image",

    "figure  [ ao - lucky - image ] shows our final image obtained by combining the best 10% images with a drizzle algorithm .",
    "because the psf shape obtained for our lucky imaging is complex and we already ruled out companions inside a @xmath217 radius with magellan+clio2 , and given that our objective with lucky imaging was to rule out companions at larger angular distances , we did not perform psf substraction algorithms in order to obtain the @xmath236 contrasts at those distances . instead , we used simple aperture photometry in order to estimate the @xmath236 contrasts outside the @xmath217 radius by performing a procedure similar to that described in @xcite . in summary , we estimated the noise level in a @xmath237 box at each radial distance at @xmath231 different angles for distances larger than @xmath217 from the estimated centroid of the image ( where the contribution of the target star psf to the background level is low ) , and calculated the magnitude contrast by obtaining the flux of the target star using a 5-pixel radius around it and a 5-pixel radius about the desired distance from the star , where @xmath236 counts are summed to each pixel at that distance before performing the aperture photometry",

    "the planet scenario which we have implied in the past sub - section , we make use of the formalism described in @xcite as implemented on the publicly available ` vespa ` package . in short , ` vespa ` considers all the false - positive scenarios that might give rise to the observed periodic dips in the light curve and , using photometric and spectroscopic information of the target star , calculates the false - positive probability ( fpp ) which is the complement of the probability of there being a planet given the observed signal . because our archival and modern imaging presented on  2.4 rule out any companion at distances larger than @xmath222 radius , we consider this radius in our search for possible false - positive scenarios using ` vespa ` , which considers the area around the target star in which one might suspect false - positives could arise .",

    "as it will be discussed in the next section , both the planet radius and mass puts bd+20594 in a very interesting part of the mass - radius diagram .",
    "therefore , it is important to discuss the constraints that our spectroscopic and new , ao and lucky imaging observations pose on possible background stars that might dilute the transit depth and thus cause us to underestimate the transit radius .    given that the factor by which the planetary radius is changed by a collection of stars inside the aperture used to obtain the photometry of the target star is given by @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the fraction of the total flux in the aperture added by the star being transited , we estimate that only stars with magnitude differences @xmath260 are able to change the transit radius by magnitudes similar to the quoted uncertainties in table [ table : planet - params ] .",
    "we note that such magnitude differences in the kepler bandpass are ruled out from @xmath228 to the aperture radius used to obtain the photometry for our target star : our ao and lucky imaging observations rule out companions of such magnitudes from @xmath228 to @xmath216 ( see figure [ contrast - plot ] ) . on the other hand , stars with magnitude differences of that order should be evident on our retrieved archival and new images presented in  2.4 , at least at distances of @xmath216 from our target star , and up to and beyond the @xmath215 aperture used to obtain the k2 photometry .",
    "given that the remaining unexplored area on the sky is very small ( only @xmath228 around our target star ) , and that a star of such magnitude should produce an evident peak on the cross - correlation function on our high resolution spectra which is not seen , we consider that our derived transit radius is confidently unaffected by dilutions of background field stars .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the large mass ( @xmath261 ) for the calculated radius ( @xmath262 ) found for bd+20594b is very interesting .",
    "figure  [ mr - diagram ] compares bd+20594b with other discovered exoplanets with radii less than @xmath263 ( @xmath264 neptune ) and masses smaller than @xmath265 ( limits of theoretical models ) as retrieved from exoplanets.eu except for the kepler-10 planets , for which we use the masses obtained by @xcite , along with 2-layer models obtained from @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , bd+20594b spans a regime in radius at which most exoplanets have low densities and are composed of large amounts of volatiles @xcite . in particular",
    ", taking the mass - radius estimates for bd+20594b at face value , the best - fit composition assuming a 2-layer model for the planet is @xmath266 mgsio@xmath9 , i.e. , a pure rock composition , positioning the planet in the boundary of  possibly rocky \" and  non - rocky \" planets .",
    "more realistic three - layer alternatives , however , can explain the observed radius and mass of the planet if a rock / fe core has an added volatile envelope , composed either by water or h / he ( see , e.g. , the modelling for kepler-10c in * ? ? ?",
    "if , for example , we assume an earth - like interior composition for the planet ( i.e. , @xmath267 mgsio@xmath9 and @xmath268 fe ) and again take the mass and radius estimates at face value , three - layer models obtained from @xcite give a possible @xmath269 water envelope for the planet ( corresponding to @xmath270 in mass ) .",
    "this thus gives a maximum radius for a possible h / he envelope , which would anyways produce a small layer of much less than a percent in mass ; at least significantly smaller than the one modelled for kepler-10c .",
    "given that the errors on the mass of bd+20594b are large enough to be consistent with several compositions , a careful assessment must be made in order to explore its possible rocky nature . to this end , we follow the approach introduced by @xcite and compute @xmath271 , the posterior probability that a planet is sufficiently dense to be rocky , which is defined as the fraction of the joint mass - radius posterior distribution that falls between a planet composition consistent with being rocky .",
    "a probably rocky planet , then , would have @xmath272 , while a planet with a density that is too low to be rocky would result in @xmath273 .",
    "the definition of  rocky planet \" used in @xcite , which we adopt in this work , is given by those planets spanning compositions between @xmath266 rock and @xmath266 fe .",
    "although this definition is based on simple 2-layer models for the planetary composition , and in theory for a given point in the mass - radius diagram planets could have denser compositions with a gaseous envelope on top , we use this metric anyways in order to compare our newly discovered exoplanet in terms of the population of already discovered small planets .",
    "this is an important point to make , as @xmath271 is actually an upper limit on the probability that a planet is indeed rocky . to compute this value and compare it to the population of exoplanets with secure masses and radii discovered so far",
    ", we use the models from @xcite . to sample from the posterior distributions given the posterior estimates published in the literature for the different exoplanets , we use the methods described in appendix  a of @xcite and assume these radii and masses are drawn from skew - normal distributions in order to use the asymmetric error bars published for those parameters , while we use the posterior samples of our mcmc fits described in  3.2 to sample from the posterior joint distribution of mass and radius of bd+20594b .",
    "our results are depicted in figure  [ procky ] , where we also indicate the threshold radius found by @xcite at which there is a significant transition between rocky and non - rocky exoplanets , with smaller exoplanets having in general rocky compositions and larger exoplanets having less dense compositions .    as evident in figure",
    "[ procky ] , bd+20594b is in an interesting position in this diagram .",
    "the closest exoplanet to bd+20594b in this diagram is kepler-20b , which has a radius of @xmath274 , which is only @xmath275 away from the  rocky \" boundary .",
    "bd+20594b , on the other hand , is more than @xmath236 away from it . with a value of @xmath276",
    ", bd+20594b is the first neptune - sized exoplanet to date with a large ( compared to the typical neptune - sized planet ) posterior probability of being dense enough to be rocky .",
    "the large mass obtained for bd+20594b implies that if the planet ever had the chance to acquire an atmosphere , it should retain it .",
    "however , if the planet is indeed actually primarly composed of rock , given its small radius , a significant h / he envelope is unlikely in the usual settings of planet formation .",
    "calculations using core accretion theory by @xcite , predict that if the mass of rock in the protoplanet is on the order of @xmath277 , even for disk dissipation time - scales on the order of @xmath278kyr an accretion of a @xmath279 h / he envelope should happen . even in the case of a large opacity of the protoplanetary disk , a mass of rock similar to the one possible for bd+20594b should imply at least this level of h / he accretion .",
    "given the bulk composition and distance of bd+20594b to its parent star , mass loss due to x - ray and extreme uv radiation from its parent star its unlikely .",
    "if this indeed is the primary composition of this planet , it might be possible that it formed at late stages in the protoplanetary disk , under conditions similar to those on transition disks @xcite or that some external effect removed the accreted envelope from the planet .",
    "recent studies on giant impacts , which predict efficient devolatilization mechanisms for super - earths , might prove useful in explaining the lack of an extended atmosphere for bd+20594b if the planet ever accreted a significant h / he atmosphere in the first place @xcite .",
    "in terms of mass and radius , bd+20594b is similar to both kepler-131b @xcite and kepler-10c @xcite . although both of them are probably non - rocky due to their low @xmath271 ( @xmath280 and @xmath281 respectively ) , which is the main difference with bd+20594b , they are also  warm \" neptune - sized planets just as bd+20594b , with periods of @xmath282 and @xmath283 , respectively . the similarity in mass , radius and period between kepler-10c and bd+20594b , in fact ,",
    "makes both of these planets excellent laboratories for comparison in order to put planet formation theories to test .",
    "finally , it is interesting to mention that the sub - solar metallicity of the host star adds more weight to the growing evidence that low - mass planets tend to be found orbiting stars with a lower metallicity content @xcite or at least they appear to show a lack of preference towards metal - rich stars @xcite .",
    "using k2 photometry from campaign 4 and a follow - up effort including radial - velocities from the harps spectrograph , we have presented bd+20594b , a planet with a radius @xmath262 and mass of @xmath261 orbiting a solar - type star .",
    "bd+20594b lies in an interesting position in the mass - radius diagram , in the boundary between `` possibly rocky '' and `` non - rocky '' planets .",
    "given the brightness of the host star ( @xmath0 ) , bd+20594b is amenable for future follow - up studies , which will enable a detailed study of its mass and hence composition , that might be able to confirm whether bd+20594b is in the `` possibly rocky '' or `` non - rocky '' regime on the mass - radius diagram .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of bd+20594b , a high density sub - neptune exoplanet , made using photometry from campaign 4 of the two - wheeled kepler ( k2 ) mission , ground - based radial velocity follow - up from harps and high resolution lucky and adaptive optics imaging obtained using astralux and magao , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the host star is a bright ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , slightly metal poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath2 dex ) solar analogue located at @xmath3 pc from earth , for which we find a radius of @xmath4 and a mass of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a joint analysis of the k2 photometry and harps radial velocities reveal that the planet is in a @xmath6 day orbit around its host star , has a radius of @xmath7 , and a mass of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> although the data at hand puts the planet in the region of the mass - radius diagram where we could expect planets with a pure rock ( i.e. magnesium silicate ) composition using two - layer models ( i.e. , between rock / iron and rock / ice compositions ) , we discuss more realistic three - layer composition models which can explain the high density of the discovered exoplanet . </S>",
