    "by contrast , @xmath136 for composite bosons are negative scalars since @xmath124 is a decreasing function of @xmath4 , as seen from eq.([eq18 ] ) .",
    "this makes the number operator mean value for cobosons smaller than its elementary boson value @xmath4 , due to a `` moth - eaten '' effect similar to the one we have already found in other problems dealing with composite bosons : when a coboson 0 is added to @xmath4 other cobosons 0 , the additional coboson feels the other @xmath4 s through the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "therefore @xmath4 elementary fermion pair states are blocked and thus missed in its linear combination , as if these were `` eaten '' by @xmath4 `` moths '' .",
    "this picture allows us to physically understand all decreases found for cobosons , when compared to their counterpart elementary boson values .",

    "these explicitly reflect fermion exchanges between components of composite bosons .",
    "we find that the number of coincidences in second - order correlations is enhanced compared to elementary bosons , so is the variance of the field .",

    "precisely , fermion exchanges correlate composite boson states .",
