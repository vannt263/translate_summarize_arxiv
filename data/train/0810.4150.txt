    "the rate at which a galaxy is forming massive stars is a central measure of its current status and of its place in the overall pattern of galaxy evolution .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) proposed an array of star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators and quantitative relations for their use .",
    "there are two basic approaches included in his sfr metrics .",
    "one is to use optical or ultraviolet data , which can be traced back directly to the outputs of hot , young stars but must be corrected for interstellar extinction .",
    "the second is to treat the far infrared outputs of galaxies as a calorimeter , so the luminosity in this spectral range is a measure of the total power being produced by hot , young stars .",
    "recent work has combined the ultraviolet , optical , and infrared indicators ( e.g. , iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2006 , dale et al . 2007 , calzetti et al .",
    "the motivation is to make the most accurate and comprehensive determination of the sfr , assuming that a range of observations is available for a galaxy .",
    "however , we often face a different challenge : given a very limited suite of observations , what is the best we can do in determining sfrs ?",
    "this paper addresses this problem , and specifically the issues of : 1 . ) how to determine sfrs from single - band ( e.g. , 24@xmath0 m ) infrared measurements ; and 2 . ) under what conditions such determinations are reasonably accurate .",
    "the paper is motivated by the success of mips ( rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) 24@xmath0 m photometry in measuring large numbers of faint galaxies whose infrared outputs are not currently accessible at longer wavelengths due to confusion noise and sensitivity limitations .",
    "previous work ( e.g. , papovich & bell 2002 ; dale et al . 2005 ; smith et al .",
    "2007 ) has emphasized the broad variety of infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and the resulting uncertainties in the bolometric luminosities and thus sfrs extrapolated from 24@xmath0 m measurements .",
    "nonetheless , for lack of any viable alternative , such sfrs lie at the core of most studies of distant galaxies in the thermal infrared .    to contend with the range of behavior between 24@xmath0 m and the far infrared , we will examine two questions .",
    "existing libraries of sed templates ( e.g. , chary & elbaz 2001 ; dale & helou 2002 ; siebenmorgen & krgel 2007 ) show a strong pattern of behavior with bolometric luminosity .",
    "the first question for this paper is how much the range of sed behavior can be constrained by introducing 24@xmath0 m luminosity as a parameter in selecting a suitable galaxy sed .",
    "the second question is how useful 24@xmath0 m luminosity by itself is to determine sfrs .",
    "this question is motivated by the remarkably small scatter between the extinction - corrected pa@xmath1 and 24@xmath0 m luminosities of infrared galaxies ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "we will demonstrate that sfrs can be estimated from 24@xmath0 m photometry to an accuracy of better than 0.2 dex , comparable to the accuracy obtainable with full far infrared luminosities .",
    "an important part of our arguments depends on accurate sed templates for galaxies .",
    "we include in the appendix a description of the set of templates used in this paper .",
    "these templates involve both new data from _ spitzer _ and new methods to combine spectroscopy , photometry , and theoretical models in a consistent way .",
    "they apply to galaxies strongly dominated by star formation , as judged by x - ray properties , ( e.g. , armus et al .",
    "2007 ) , broad sed characteristics ( farrah et al . 2003 ) , and by their mid - infrared spectra ( genzel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we also construct a set of average templates for the luminosity range ( @xmath16 ) . up to @xmath17",
    ", these templates are based directly on observations of local galaxies ; above this luminosity , they require extrapolation and have substantial uncertainties .",
    "our templates have played important roles in a number of recent studies ( donley et al .",
    "2007 ; rigby et al . 2008",
    "; seymour et al . 2008 ; donley et al . 2008 ) .",
    "they are provided in tables available on line .",
    "we introduce the templates in section 2 ( with details in the appendix ) . in section 3 , we derive sfrs in terms of 24@xmath0 m photometry . we also provide a conversion of observed flux densities to star formation rates as a function of redshift for _ spitzer _ at 24@xmath0 m , _ herschel _ at 70 and 110@xmath0 m , _ wise _ at 24@xmath0 m , and _ jwst _ in the 20@xmath0 m range .",
    "we consider the radio - infrared relation as an independent indicator of the sfr in section 4 and summarize our results in section 5 .",
    "the appendix describes how we assembled sed templates for eleven local lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "we also discuss how we used them to construct average templates over the relevant luminosity range and covering the 5@xmath0 m to 30 cm spectral range .",
    "in addition , we combined the results of dale et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to produce a complementary set of templates at lower luminosities .",
    "the templates are provided in online tables ; we show them in figures 1  6 .    in the appendix",
    ", we also discuss the applicability of the templates at high redshift . their general behavior across the observed mid - infrared ( irac bands ) , far - infrared ( mips 24 and 70@xmath0 m bands ) , and radio ( 1.4ghz ) appears to agree with observation out at least to z @xmath2 2 .",
    "there is , however , a wide range of behavior of the irac bands relative to the mips ones , presumably because at z @xmath18 0.5 irac probes the stellar photospheric output and mips the infrared excess .",
    "the former includes the contributions of both old and young stars , while the latter is powered primarily by the young ones . as a result",
    ", galaxies with the same star forming rate but differing amounts of pre - existing stellar populations will show differences in the relative outputs in the irac and mips bands .",
    "at z@xmath2 2 , luminous infrared galaxies tend to have aromatic bands of strength and line profile characteristic of less luminous galaxies locally ( e.g. , sajina et al . 2007 ; papovich et al .",
    "2007 , pope et al .",
    "2008 , rigby et al . 2008 ;",
    "farrah et al . 2008 ) . consequently , when used with observed 24@xmath0 m ( rest 8@xmath0 m ) observations to predict intrinsic 24@xmath0 m flux densities , the templates may return values that are too high ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is not clear at what redshift this shift in infrared sed behavior begins to manifest itself .",
    "for example , at z @xmath2 0.7 , our templates span the range of observed far infrared colors , but their behavior at high luminosities may indicate a similar shift in infrared colors as is seen at z @xmath2 2 .",
    "we also show that the radio - infrared relation is preserved at z @xmath2 2 , at least when comparing with the far infrared ( @xmath2 100@xmath0 m )",
    ". however , there are large enough uncertainties in the current determinations of the radio - infrared relation for the mips 24@xmath0 m band at high redshift that the expected ( small ) shift in it can not be verified ( see section 4 ) .",
    "the indicated shifts in behavior from local to z@xmath2 2 infrared galaxies are modest ( at most factors of two ) .",
    "thus , the local templates can give a reasonably accurate picture of the behavior of the high redshift ones .",
    "however , since there are no local purely star - forming ulirgs with luminosities above @xmath19 , all determinations of star formation rates at very high luminosities ( including virtually all individually - detected galaxies at @xmath20 ) are highly uncertain .",
    "further work is needed to improve our understanding of the detailed behavior of high redshift galaxies in the far infrared , either verifying the use of local templates to represent them or indicating more clearly than with present knowledge how they need to be modified .",
    "sfrs are widely estimated from far infrared observations using the far infrared luminosities and the formulation of kennicutt ( 1998 ) .",
    "there are ambiguities in this approach because the far infrared luminosity of a galaxy generally has two components , one powered by young stars to which the kennicutt formulation applies , and a second , cooler component probably powered largely by the interstellar radiation field ( e.g. , devereux & eales 1989 , popescu et al .",
    "2002 ) , which should be excluded from the kennicutt formula .",
    "another issue arises with _ spitzer _ observations because the 24@xmath0 m data are much deeper relative to a given sfr and also far less confused than the data at 70 and 160@xmath0 m .",
    "thus , the far infrared luminosities can not be measured for many galaxies detected at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "other missions will face similar issues due to confusion noise ( e.g. , _ herschel _ ) , or will not provide capabilities at all relevant wavelengths ( e.g. , _ wise _ , _ jwst _ ) .    the usual approach to determining sfrs with single - band observations has been to redshift a sed template to match the source , normalize it to the observed flux density , determine l(tir ) or l@xmath21(ir)(ir ) as the luminosity obtained by integrating the sed of a galaxy from 5 to 1000@xmath0 m .",
    "in addition , l(fir ) designates the portion of the far infrared output of a galaxy that is powered by young stars .",
    "it is discussed in section 3.1.2 . ] , and iterate to match the correct template for the estimated source luminosity .",
    "the accuracy of the results obviously depends on the quality of the sed template library .",
    "the multiple steps in this procedure each introduce additional potential errors .    to mitigate these problems , in this section we will first derive the relation between 24@xmath0 m flux density and the sfr .",
    "we demonstrate how the derived relation can avoid the ambiguities in sfrs measured in the conventional way based on total or far infrared luminosities .",
    "we apply our result at different redshifts , using k - corrections from mips - observed to rest 24@xmath0 m flux densities , based on our average templates .",
    "we provide the results in the form of fits that , with interpolation , can be used for a direct conversion of 24@xmath0 m data into sfrs .",
    "the results for mips also apply to _ wise_. we carry out a similar calculation for the 70@xmath0 m and 100@xmath0 m bands of pacs on _ herschel _ and for three bands near 20@xmath0 m for miri on _",
    "jwst_.        in typical star - forming regions , hydrogen recombination line strength is a basic metric to estimate the level of massive star formation .",
    "therefore , we provide an updated derivation of the relation between l(24 ) and l(pa@xmath1 ) for luminous star forming regions and galaxies .",
    "we used the data for luminous galaxies of alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) plus the dataset assembled by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( kindly provided by d. calzetti ) to provide extensive coverage at lower luminosities .",
    "we applied some small corrections to the first data set .",
    "where the redshift of the galaxy put the pa@xmath1 line far enough from the center of the nicmos filter to affect the transmission by more than 5% , we corrected the line strength to compensate .",
    "we also determined the transformation from iras 25@xmath0 m to mips 24@xmath0 m flux density by ratioing measurements of galaxies measured in common ( from the sings data , dale et al .",
    "2007 and from engelbracht et al . 2008 ) , rather than from sed models .",
    "we put both data sets on a common calibration basis : 1 . )",
    "we took the bandpass corrections out of the photometry reported by engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; and 2 . )",
    "we corrected all pre-2007 photometry to the current mips calibration ( engelbracht et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the resulting relationship between extinction - corrected l(pa@xmath1 ) and l(24 ) for the galaxies and hii regions is shown in figure 7 .",
    "we have fitted the data for the @xmath2 solar ( `` high '' : calzetti et al .",
    "2007 ) metallicity cases with a linear relation and find a rms scatter of 0.27 dex .",
    "the scatter is dominated by two low - lying galaxies .",
    "one of them , ngc 4736 , is in a post - starburst phase ( walker et al .",
    "1988 ; taniguchi et al .",
    "1996 ) , which explains its low level of pa@xmath1 emission . the other ,",
    "ic 860 , has very strong h@xmath22 absorption ( kim et al .",
    "1995 ) , suggesting a similar explanation .",
    "we reject these two low outliers and the two highest outliers and fit only for @xmath23 , to obtain :    @xmath24    with a scatter of 0.21 dex .",
    "we use the trimmed result in the following .",
    "the way it has been determined , it should be used with the direct pipeline output for the mips 24@xmath0 m photometry ( no photometric bandpass corrections ) .",
    "our derived relation agrees with those of both alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) within the errors but has smaller errors because it combines both of their samples into a single relation .",
    "it also has a somewhat different slope that results largely from reconciling all the 24 and 25@xmath0 m photometry to a common basis .",
    "the scatter in this relation is similar to the scatter just in computing l(tir ) from different data sets .",
    "therefore , using the conventional approach of estimating l(tir ) from l(24 ) and then the sfr from l(tir ) interposes a step that adds substantial uncertainty to the final result without improving its accuracy .    the relationship between l(pa@xmath1 ) and l(24 )",
    "is not proportional , but shows a progressively greater output at 24@xmath0 m relative to pa@xmath1 with increasing luminosity .",
    "it is well known that the extinction in star - forming galaxies is greater at higher sfr ( e.g. wang & heckman 1996 ; buat et al . 2007 ) and that it may require empirical correction to reconcile balmer-@xmath1 derived sfrs to radio or infrared measurements ( e.g. sullivan et al .",
    "the present work extends this problem to pa@xmath1 and to higher infrared luminosities .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "first , the hii regions in more luminous galaxies may raise the dust to a higher temperature and cause additional emission at 24@xmath0 m relative to the pa@xmath1 luminosity ( calzetti et al .",
    "alternatively , at high luminosities there may be a larger proportion of young massive stars embedded in ultra - compact hii regions , from which pa@xmath1 can not escape and within which the dust may absorb a significant fraction of the ionizing photons ( rigby and rieke 2004 , dopita et al .",
    "2006 ) ; in this case , extinction - corrected pa@xmath1 may underestimate the sfr and the 24@xmath0 m luminosity may be a better indicator .",
    "consistent with this possibility , in the young star forming system c of arp 299 , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find a deficiency of flux in the mid - infrared fine structure neon lines , consistent with a substantial portion of very heavily embedded and dense star forming regions .    as a test of these possibilities",
    ", we look at the implications of setting the sfr proportional to the extinction - corrected pa@xmath1 .",
    "we use the relation between l(24 ) and l(tir ) from the appendix and anticipate the results of the following sections to derive under these assumptions :    @xmath25    here and in the following , we indicate intermediate estimates of the star formation rate in lower case to distinguish them from final formulations . the deviation from linearity in equation 2 ( slope @xmath26 ) would imply that over the range of about three orders of magnitude in the luminosities of starbursts , lirgs , and ulirgs , the generation of bolometric infrared luminosity from young stars varies in efficiency by a factor of two . since there is no easy physical explanation , we instead adopt the point of view that the sfr is proportional to the appropriately calculated infrared luminosity .",
    "this assumption is identical to that made by kennicutt ( 1998 ) in formulating his widely - applied relationship between sfr and l(fir ) .",
    "simply stated , we ( and kennicutt ) assume that the fir acts as a calorimeter , that virtually all of the luminosity of the young stars is captured and re - emitted in the fir .",
    "there is an important additional implication of the non - proportionality between pa@xmath1 and l(tir ) .",
    "it suggests that it may be impossible to capture the full hot stellar output in very luminous galaxies using optical and near infrared hydrogen recombination lines .",
    "that is , sfrs estimated on the basis of extinction - corrected pa@xmath1 should be taken as lower limits , and for very luminous galaxies , lower limits by significant factors .",
    "this issue will grow in importance with the use of recombination lines ( such as h@xmath1 ) at shorter wavelengths than pa@xmath1 .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) has calibrated the sfr in terms of bolometric luminosity , which he assumed emerges in the fir :    @xmath27    this formula was derived from theoretical starburst models and the calorimetric assumption that all their luminosity would emerge in the fir ( r. kennicutt , private communication , 2008 ) . applying",
    "the formula is not as straightforward as it appears because it is difficult to define observationally the correct form of l@xmath28 .",
    "the total infrared luminosity , l@xmath21(ir ) , includes the very far infrared and submm , spectral regions that in starburst - luminosity galaxies tend to be dominated by the emission of cold dust(ir ) distinguishes this quantity , obtained by integrating the galaxy output from 5 to 1000@xmath0 m , from l(tir ) , which is calculated according to the procedure recommended by sanders et al .",
    "( 2003 ) on the basis of the _ iras _ measurements alone . ] .",
    "this dust is probably heated by the interstellar radiation field dominated by an older population of stars , not by the hot , newly formed stars ( e.g. , devereux & eales 1989 ; popescu et al .",
    "in addition , there are different algorithms for computing l@xmath21(ir ) , increasingly used in place of l(fir ) as specified by kennicutt .",
    "they produce somewhat different answers from similar data .",
    "finally , the far infrared seds of galaxies are not usually well sampled and in many situations ( e.g. , deep cosmological surveys ) are technically very difficult to sample to great depth because of confusion noise .    to apply kennicutt s relation between sfr and l(fir )",
    "accurately requires that we isolate the portion of l@xmath21(ir ) that is powered by the young stars .",
    "figure 6 suggests a simple way to do so .",
    "our lowest - luminosity templates have a substantial contribution from cold dust , but as the luminosity is increased the far infrared regions converge to a single form .",
    "the templates show that the more vigorously star forming galaxies are producing a single unique far infrared sed that eventually overwhelms the cold dust component ( see devereux & eales ( 1989 ) for a discussion of this decomposition of far infrared seds ) .    to make use of this behavior , we quantify it in terms of l(24)/ l@xmath21(ir ) computed from the templates and shown in figure 8 .",
    "the initial increase with luminosity in the proportion of the luminosity emerging at 24@xmath0 m results from the increasing prominence of the emission by warm dust heated by young stars , over the cold dust heated by the interstellar radiation field .",
    "at very high luminosity , there is a modest decrease in the ratio probably due to increased optical depth in the star forming regions .",
    "we want to avoid these effects in our calibration of the sfr , so we will use the peak ratio at log(l(tir))=11 , l(24)/l@xmath21(ir ) = 0.158 . from figure 8 ,",
    "the smallest plausible value is 10% lower .",
    "this result allows us to modify equation 3 so it applies to measurements at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "if we also put the luminosities into solar units , we have    @xmath29    where the range corresponds to the 10% range of l(24)/l@xmath21(ir ) discussed above . because 24@xmath0 m is in the heart of the spectral range dominated by the warm dust associated with recent star formation",
    ", the new formulation circumvents the issues in the original formula associated with the definition of l(fir ) .",
    "the infrared metrics for sfr are based on a calorimetric argument , and they are subject to systematic errors if the calorimeter is leaky , i.e. if significant amounts of the stellar luminosity escape directly in the ultraviolet rather than being absorbed and reradiated in the infrared .",
    "this issue can be quantified by comparing l(uv ) with l(tir ) .",
    "various studies ( e.g. , bell 2003 ; schmitt et al . 2006 ; buat et al .",
    "2007 ) have evaluated this behavior . for infrared - selected galaxies ,",
    "they agree that the uv contribution to the total young - star - powered luminosity is only about 20% at log(l(tir ) ) @xmath2 9.75 and decreases rapidly with increasing infrared luminosity , e.g. to @xmath2 8% at log(l(tir ) ) @xmath2 10.5 .",
    "therefore , the calorimeter assumption is questionable for log(l(tir ) ) @xmath30 9.5 , but good for log(l(tir ) ) @xmath12 9.75 . at 10@xmath9 l@xmath4 ,",
    "the average level of leakage is only @xmath2 2.5% ( buat et al .",
    "if we correct equation 4 for this effect , we get    @xmath31      although the above derivation is simple in concept , it relies on a secondary indicator for the sfr , namely the far infrared output associated with the absorption of the young stellar luminosity by interstellar dust .",
    "a more direct metric for the sfr can be based on hydrogen recombination lines , excited directly by the young , hot stars . a strong connection between the hydrogen recombination lines and l(24 ) is indicated both by the small scatter in the fit of l(pa@xmath1 ) vs. l(24 ) , and by the spatial correlation between the 24@xmath0 m output of galaxies with both the hii regions and with the diffuse h@xmath1 ( e.g. , hinz et al . 2004 ; tabatabaei et al .",
    "we therefore explore a calibration of the sfr in terms of these lines .",
    "we map l(pa@xmath1 ) to l(24 ) by constraining the fit in figure 7 to @xmath32 log(l(24 ) ) @xmath33 , corresponding roughly to @xmath34 log(l(tir ) ) @xmath35 .",
    "we assume over this range that the optical depth effects that arise at very high luminosity are not strong .",
    "also , although we fit down to the luminosity range where the luminosity escaping in the uv is large for whole galaxies , much of the data in this range is for individual hii regions within large , metal - rich galaxies so these effects are greatly reduced .",
    "the best fit to the data reproduces a slope similar to that for the whole range of luminosities , but if we constrain the slope to be unity @xmath36 grows by only 14% .",
    "the result of this latter case is that    @xmath37    this calibration is identical to that derived by kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for the hii regions in m51 .",
    "although these data are included in our fit , we have also included full galaxies as well as additional hii regions .",
    "the nebular conditions in starbursting galaxies are well constrained ( e.g. , roy et al . 2008 and references therein ) , with low electron temperatures ( @xmath2 5000k ) and densities of 500 - 50000 @xmath38 .",
    "the range of case b recombination line intensities is small under these conditions .",
    "the relation proposed by kennicutt ( 1998 ) can be converted to use with pa@xmath1 assuming a ratio of p@xmath1/h@xmath1 = 0.128 ( hummer & storey 1987 ) :    @xmath39    as indicated by alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and calzetti et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , it is possible that the calibration applies poorly to whole galaxies because of diffuse extended pa@xmath1 emission that is not captured by the nicmos imaging used to measure the pa@xmath1 line strength .",
    "we can set an upper limit on such diffuse emission using sfr indicators that are sensitive to it , such as h@xmath1 imaging , deep 24@xmath0 m imaging , or filled - aperture high frequency radio photometry .",
    "m33 has been thoroughly studied in all three of these indicators ( devereux et al .",
    "1997 ; hinz et al .",
    "2004 ; tabatabaei et al .",
    "2007 ) . of order 30% of the free - free , h@xmath1 , and 24@xmath0 m signals are associated with a diffuse component .",
    "the extinction to this component is very small , whereas that for the compact sources is a@xmath40 @xmath2 1 , so h@xmath1 images overemphasize the relative intrinsic strength of the diffuse emission .",
    "the largest body of applicable data for other galaxies is h@xmath1 imaging ( e.g. , devereux et al .",
    "1994 ; devereux et al . 1996",
    "; hameed & devereux 2005 ) .",
    "these studies show that 30% is an approximate upper limit for the fraction of diffuse h@xmath1 and indicate that it should be much less obscured than the emission associated with discrete sources .",
    "we conclude that the relative intrinsic level of diffuse emission associated with recent sfr is on average no more than @xmath2 15% .    making use of equation 7 ,",
    "we find    @xmath41    where the range is without ( 1.15 ) and with ( 1.30 ) an allowance for diffuse emission .",
    "this expression is virtually identical to sfr@xmath28 ( equation 5 ) .",
    "the agreement of the two independent estimators implies that the systematic errors are well controlled . the combined result from equations 5 and",
    "8 under the kennicutt guidelines is then    @xmath42      the derived sfr is based only on the outputs of very massive stars and hence provides virtually no constraint on the rate of formation of low mass stars .",
    "however , the quoted rate for the total formation of stars conventionally integrates down to the minimum stellar mass , @xmath2 0.1 m@xmath4 , and therefore depends strongly on the assumed initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) assumed a salpeter imf with a single power law slope of -1.35 from 0.1 to 100m@xmath4 .",
    "however , rieke et al . ( 1993 ) and alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that such an imf violates plausible constraints on the dynamical mass for the starbursts in m82 and ngc 1614 .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "( 1993 ) derived forms of the imf _ ab initio _ for m82 that illustrate some general requirements .",
    "they argued that the imf in m82 needed to have relatively more massive stars",
    "_ than the imfs then proposed for the local field _",
    "( e.g. , miller & scalo 1979 ; basu & rana 1992 ) .",
    "all of these local imfs fell toward high masses much faster than the salpeter slope .",
    "we can compare various forms of imf with roughly similar slopes by comparing the mass in stars above 10 m@xmath4 .",
    "imf8 , the formulation favored in the models of rieke et al . ( 1993 ) , has a net slope at high mass similar to the salpeter value and produces the identical proportion of such stars as the imf proposed by kroupa ( 2002 ) , which has a slope of -0.3 from 0.08 to 0.5 m@xmath4 and of -1.3 from 0.5 to 100 m@xmath4 .",
    "a similar result applies to the chabrier ( 2003 ) imf .",
    "the widespread adoption of the salpeter - like slope with a more shallow slope at low masses to fit extragalactic star forming regions is therefore a confirmation of the results of rieke et al .",
    "the total mass for any of these imfs is @xmath2 0.66 times that of the unbroken salpeter form that yields the same mass in stars @xmath18 10m@xmath4 ( as was adopted by kennicutt ( 1998 ) ) .",
    "rieke et al .",

    "our assembly of sed templates begins with a detailed consideration of eleven local lirgs and ulirgs .",

    "finally , we discuss the derivation of a compatible set of templates for lower luminosity infrared galaxies .",
    "the number of ulirgs that have both high quality data across the electromagnetic spectrum and are firmly established to be dominated by star formation is small .",
    "our sample is iras 12112 + 0305 , iras 14348 - 1447 , iras 22491 - 1808 , and arp 220 , all of which were studied by armus et al .",

    "2006 ) , plus ngc 4194 .",
    "our templates for lirgs make use of previously unpublished spectroscopy obtained with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; houck et al .",
    "2004 ) on _ spitzer_. the observations ( pid 30577 ) were taken in low resolution , and in mapping mode to cover all or nearly all of the infrared emitting region of the galaxy .",
    "they were reduced using cubism ( smith et al . 2007 ) , a package written specifically for optimum reduction of irs mapping observations .",
    "the resulting spectral maps were then combined into a single spectrum to represent the integrated infrared output of the galaxy .",
    "these spectra were supplemented by those of ngc 1614 and ngc 4194 obtained from brandl et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the single slit spectra also include virtually all of the infrared - bright region ( after the rescaling of the short wavelength spectra as described in brandl et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) .",
    "for the ulirg templates , we made use of published spectra ( rigopoulou et al .",
    "1999 ; armus et al .",
    "2007 ; armus , private communication , 2007 ) .",
    "the irs slits should include most of the flux from all of these galaxies .",
    "in all cases , the agreement of the spectra with photometry of the full galaxy verified that we had not missed any significant signal with the spectra .",
    "in addition , we obtained irac ( fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) photometry of the sample galaxies from the _ spitzer _ archive ( pids 32 , 108 , & 3672 ) .",
    "they were reduced in the ssc pipeline version s14 and photometry was obtained within apertures that included the entire galaxies . a correction for extended emission",
    "was applied to the results as recommended by the _",
    "science center ( http://ssc.spitzer , caltech.edu/irac/calib/extcal/ ) .",
    "we also make use of the irac and mips photometry from the sings program ( dale et al .",
    "2007 ) and of iras photometry , where we preferentially use the reductions of sanders et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "there are no homogeneous galaxy spectra that cover the entire 0.4 to 2@xmath0 m range .",
    "however , as a key input to the templates , we used the spectrum from 0.8 to 2.4@xmath0 m of the lightly obscured lirg ngc 1614 ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2001 ) , obtained with a spectrograph that maintains the relative normalization of the spectral segments @xcite .",
    "we compared it with the galaxev ( version 2003 ) model from bruzual and charlot",
    "( http://www.cida.ve/  bruzual / bc2003 ) for a solar metallicity , 20myr old population .",
    "the agreement of the overall sed and spectral features was quite close , within the measurement errors as well as they could be judged by the examination of the spectrum .",
    "the galaxev model was therefore used to represent a full galaxy spectrum .    for a whole galaxy ,",
    "there is a question of the relative contribution of old and young stars ; that is , do faint outer and old components add up to sufficient flux to influence the overall spectrum .",
    "for our sample members , we compared the ratios of full galaxy 2mass k photometry to large beam iras 25@xmath0 m fluxes with the similar ratio just for the starburst region of m82 to test this possibility . in only two of our eleven galaxies ( i.e. , for eso0320-g030 and ngc 2369 ) was the ratio more than a factor of two higher than that for the nucleus of m82 .",
    "this test suggests that an additional cool stellar population may dominate the near infrared flux for these two galaxies but that the young stars are prominent in the rest .",
    "in constructing templates , we force the stellar sed to fit large aperture photometry , so any issues about the details of the spectral features will be accommodated to first order .",
    "a possible exception is broad molecular bands , of which the most prominent is the 2.3@xmath0 m first overtone co absorption . to test the effect of changes in this band strength",
    ", we constructed a template with it reduced by @xmath2 0.05 to be representative of an old or low - metallicity stellar population and tested it on irac color - color plots ( donley et al .",
    "2008 , appendix b ) .",
    "it had only a small effect on the color locus .",
    "some of the less prominent spectral features may not be accurately represented in our templates , but it is not possible with current data to make a well - constrained correction for this behavior .",
    "in addition , there are alternative theoretical templates to galaxev , but again the differences are not large enough to be significant for the templates once the behavior has been forced to fit the photometry .",
    "these statements apply to use of the templates at photometric resolution , of course .",
    "relatively narrow spectral features may still be inaccurately represented ( e.g. , riffel et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we need to extend the photospheric sed to beyond 5@xmath0 m , to merge with the irs spectra .",
    "there are few galaxy spectra to use as a guide , and even spectra of stars suitable for population models of galaxies are not common .",
    "fortunately , the photospheric spectral behavior of galaxies from 2 to 5@xmath0 m should be relatively simple , being dominated by the coolest giant and supergiant stars present in large numbers .",
    "we therefore used the airborne spectrum of @xmath22 peg ( m2.5 ii - iii ) @xcite , normalized over the 2 - 2.3@xmath0 m region to the galexev model , for the extension .",
    "the co absorption strength in this star is similar to that observed in luminous star forming galaxies , so it provides an excellent surrogate for a true galaxy spectrum . in this way",
    ", we have constructed a consistent stellar photospheric continuum appropriate for a lirg or ulirg .    between 3 and 5@xmath0 m",
    ", there is additional emission from warm dust and aromatic features , ( e.g. , lu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) .",
    "however , there is no significant body of spectroscopy with a large enough beam to match to the irs spectra across this region .",
    "empirical template libraries are often quite approximate over this range ( as in dale & helou 2002 ) ) .",
    "more realistic templates in this region are important for comparison , for example , with irac - color - based methods for identifying agn .",
    "we therefore determined a typical excess spectrum starting from the iso spectrum of m82 reported by strm et al .",
    "we fitted our stellar photospheric sed to m82 in the near infrared and then subtracted it from the published spectrum to derive one of the mid - infrared excess alone .",
    "we obtained additional far infrared , submm , and radio data for the sample galaxies from the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "full - galaxy jhk photometry was taken from the 2mass extended source database .",
    "full - galaxy optical photometry was obtained from ned or other sources in the literature ( e.g. , surace & sanders 2000 , kim et al .",
    "2001 , taylor et al .",
    "2005 ) .      to construct a template",
    ", we started with our 0.4 - 5@xmath0 m stellar photospheric template and the large beam photometry in the optical and near - ir .",
    "we used a simple reddening law to match the stellar sed to the photometry from 0.4 to 2.5@xmath0 m .",
    "we took the underlying reddening as in rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) and assumed that the dust and stars were mixed in an optically thick configuration . for a few lirgs",
    ", this model failed in the blue until we added a small amount of reddening in a foreground screen .",
    "we then compared the predicted stellar photospheric output from 3 to 6@xmath0 m with the irac full - galaxy photometry .",
    "we added the m82-based infrared - excess sed multiplied by a power law slope adjustment to the stellar prediction to fit the irac photometry .",
    "the resulting template out to 6@xmath0 m always joined in a consistent manner onto the irs or iso spectrum .",
    "we used the irs spectrum to define the template to past 35@xmath0 m . for iras 17208 - 0018 , where the useful iso spectrum stops at 10.7@xmath0 m",
    ", we extended to 35@xmath0 m using the sed of iras 2249 which is very similar in the region of overlap .",
    "the spectra out to 35@xmath0",
    "m were interpolated onto a uniform wavelength sampling ( to remove the effects of redshift ) using a hermite spline technique .    to determine a far infrared template",
    ", we found that a single black body with wavelength - dependent emissivity provided an adequate fit to all of the far infrared and submm photometry of each galaxy . in comparison",
    ", the templates of dale & helou ( 2002 ) often gave a poorer fit , with a spectral peak that was too broad for the seds of the high luminosity galaxies .",
    "this behavior is perhaps not surprising given that the dale & helou templates were developed to fit galaxies of starburst luminosity , where a broad range of conditions and dust temperatures can contribute significantly to the overall sed .",
    "we optimized modified blackbody fits to each galaxy , with a resulting range in the fitted temperature of 38 - 64k and in the coefficient of emissivity of @xmath95 , where the emissivity goes as @xmath96 .",
    "despite the range of parameters , the seds are extremely similar in the submm , with some variation in the location of the peak of the sed near 100@xmath0 m . in some cases , we found that this simple fit failed to join smoothly onto the irs spectrum near 35@xmath0 m and that the spectrum beyond this wavelength was very noisy .",
    "we solved this problem by interpolating linearly from the last high - weight irs points ( near 35@xmath0 m ) to 63@xmath0 m .",
    "for the radio , we again gathered all available data , primarily from ned and from condon et al .",
    "our fits to these data assumed an intrinsic power law slope of -0.7 at high frequencies .",
    "the slightly steeper slope characteristic of starburst luminosity galaxies ( -0.8 ) gave slightly poorer fits .",
    "as necessary , the power law index was changed to a ( single ) lower value to fit the low frequency data .",
    "the final templates are shown in figures 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 along with the photometry used to constrain them . it can be seen that the templates provide a good representation of the available photometry , based on a plausible detailed sed .",

    "the dale and helou ( 2002 ) templates were developed to fit the seds of moderate luminosity star - bursting galaxies ( l @xmath30 10@xmath9 l@xmath4 ) .",
    "although they are often used as templates for high - redshift lirgs and ulirgs , figures 3 and 4 show that they differ significantly from the observed behavior of local ulirgs in the mid and far infrared and hence are probably not ideal for representing higher - redshift ones .",
    "short of about 5@xmath0 m , the dale and helou templates are relatively schematic and do not include accurate stellar photospheric data . in the 10@xmath0 m region , they omit silicate absorption , which is not strong in the starburst luminosity range for which they were optimized . however , with increasing luminosity and the accompanying increasing extinction , this feature can become quite strong in , lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "in addition , at high infrared luminosities , our far infrared seds are more peaked . in large part",
    "this results from our use of irs spectra for the 15 to 35@xmath0 m range , whereas dale and helou ( 2002 ) had to fill it in largely by interpolation .",
    "in addition , we show a chary & elbaz ( 2001 ) template for l(tir ) = @xmath98 l@xmath4",
    ". it also deviates significantly from our templates .",
    "the ce templates have strongly suppressed aromatic features at high luminosities ( not consistent with the iso ( rigopouplou et al .",

    "their behavior in the far infrared is similar to that of the dale and helou ( 2002 ) models . finally , the models of siebenmmorgen & krgel ( 2007 ) appear to have more cold dust than our templates at low luminosities and weak silicate absorption at high luminosity .",
    "that is , the availability of new data , particularly the long wavelength irs spectra , has resulted in our templates differing significantly from those produced on the basis of iso and iras data alone .        although the templates for individual galaxies are useful , for example to judge probable ranges of spectral behavior ( e.g. , donley et al .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "the scatter around this relation is large , with an rms of 0.44 dex .",
    "the curve appears to be somewhat nonlinear , with a significantly flatter slope at ulirg luminosities ( a behavior we term saturation ) .",
    "if we only fit the data for l(tir ) @xmath18",

    ", the relation appears to be slightly non - linear in log - log space in the sense that the most luminous galaxies are underluminous at 12@xmath0 m ( a mild case of saturation ) .",
    "a fit for log(l(tir ) @xmath12 10 is preferable for high luminosities :      figure 15 compares l(24 ) and l(tir ) .",

    "our relation applies to the iras and mips photometry with no bandpass or other corrections applied .",
    "a fit to the data for 8.5 @xmath44 log(l(tir ) ) is :              these fits indicate that the common approach of assuming that the l(tir ) is linearly proportional to the luminosity in some mid - infrared band can be improved by taking account of the small deviations from proportionality . the use of sed templates to carry out this conversion ( e.g. , le floch et al . 2005 ; marillac et al .",
    "2006 ) in principle solves this problem , but only by placing strong reliance on the accuracy of the templates .",
    "the linear fits show that the performance of the 24@xmath0 m band in predicting l(tir ) is only slightly worse than that at 60@xmath0 m , perhaps a surprising result since 60@xmath0 m is generally the dominant band in determining l(tir ) .",
    "we find that the 12@xmath0 m band remains useful in predicting l(tir ) but now with substantial scatter .",

    "we approached this challenge by building a spreadsheet that allows us to combine ( averaging in the logarithm ) the eleven templates with different weights .",
    "the spreadsheet conducts synthetic photometry on the combined sed , which we compare with the average relations represented by the fits to the colors derived in the preceding section . to minimize the effects of nonlinearity in the relations at 8 and 12@xmath0 m , all the fits to the colors",

    "the 6.2@xmath0 m aromatic band has moved out of the mips 24@xmath0 m band and extremely luminous star formation would be required for a detection .",

    "below this redshift , the great majority of the 24@xmath0m - detected galaxies have irac colors that place them within the contours determined by redshifting our templates through the irac bands .",

    "the absence of galaxies with large ratios of 70 to 24@xmath0 m fluxes in figure 17 provides additional evidence for this overall pattern of sed behavior .",
    "two possibilities have been suggested to explain this result ( rigby et al . 2008 , farrah et al . 2008 ) .",
    "first , the high redshift ulirgs may be undergoing extended star formation rather than the extreme nuclear events that occur locally .",
    "this possibility is consistent with interferometric measurements , ( e.g. tacconi et al .",
    "2006 , younger et al . 2008 ) indicating that , although compact , the high redshift ulirgs are significantly more extended than local ones ( e.g. , biggs & ivison 2008 , sakamoto et al .",
    "2008 ) . the extended star forming regions are likely to have lower optical depths than the local , nuclear ones . the high duty cycle of star formation in these objects ( daddi et al .",
    "2007 ) would point in the same direction .",
    "second , the behavior might be the result of lower metallicity , which would reduce the dust content of the star forming regions and reduce their optical depths in that way .",
    "in fact , engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have seen a similar trend of aromatic feature behavior in local galaxies with reduced metallicity down to about 1/3 solar    whatever the cause , given the widespread use of the mips 24@xmath0 m photometry as a star formation indicator at high redshift , it is important to allow for this shift in behavior .",
    "rigby et al . ( 2008 ) and our figure 17 demonstrate that the behavior can equivalently be described in terms of a reduction in the proportion of galaxieswith small ratios of l(8)/l(tir ) , the low lying outliers at high luminosity in figure 13 .",
    "consequently , it is likely that the scatter in this ratio is smaller at z @xmath2 2 than locally , making rest 8@xmath0 m photometry easier to interpret as an indicator of l(tir ) and star formation rates ( once it has been adequately calibrated at this redshift ) .",
    "the average templates presented here should be appropriate to first order because they are fitted to the trend of colors from 10@xmath3 l@xmath4 upward , and hence the fits are strongly influenced by the lower - luminosity local galaxies whose behavior appears to match that of the high - luminosity ones at high redshift . at intermediate redshifts ,",
    "the templates may therefore slightly under - represent the influence of the extreme sed examples ( e.g. , arp 220 ) .    to evaluate the possible uncertainties near z = 2",
    "we have fitted the trend of l(8 ) vs l(tir ) in rigby et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the stacked seds of daddi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and papovich et al .",
    "these values probably give the most representative measure of the sed behavior at this redshift .",
    "we have assumed that the 12 and 25@xmath0 m colors are unchanged from the local behavior and have de - emphasized 60@xmath0 m in the fits ( all wavelengths apply to the rest sed ) .",
    "we have used these templates to compare with the ones at the same l(tir ) fitted to local galaxies , and converted the results into rest 24@xmath0 m luminosities . for log(l(tir ) ) = 12 and 12.5 , we estimate offsets of factors of about 1.2 and 1.3 , respectively , in the sense that using our local templates will result in an overestimate of the intrinsic 24@xmath0 m flux density by these amounts ; larger offsets are likely at log(l(tir ) ) = 13 .",
    "these estimates are very approximate , since the seds of such luminous purely star - forming galaxies are not well understood either locally or at z @xmath2 2 .",
    "in fact , there are significant differences among the sets of templates proposed for such high luminosities , with no local analogs to constrain them .",
