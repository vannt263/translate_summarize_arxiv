    "in recent years growing attention has been devoted to the construction of hubble diagrams using hydrogen - rich cc - sn events ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* olivares et al .",
    "2010 ) and references therein ) in order to derive cosmological parameters independently of the usual method based on type ia sne ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* freedman et al . 2009 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility of building hubble diagrams for hydrogen - rich cc - sne is strictly related to the capability of calibrating them and , consequently , to turn them into usable distance indicators .",
    "two different approaches are used to derive distance measurements of cc - sne .",
    "one is based on theoretical spectral modelling like the expanding photosphere method ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eastman , schmidt & kirshner 1996 ) ) or the ensuing spectral expanding atmosphere method ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baron et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "others rely on more empirical techniques as the standardized candle method ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hamuy & pinto 2002 , hp02 ) ) , based on an observational correlation between the luminosity of a sn and its expansion velocity , or the method proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* elmhamdi , chugai & danziger ( 2003 , ecd03 ) ) , based on the steepness of the light curve . in previous work we studied these correlations using a data / model comparison approach and tried to address their physical origin ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* zampieri 2005 , 2007 ) ) . along this vein ,",
    "in the following we explore the existence of the correlations inferred from the aforementioned empirical methods in our model sample , which is composed of 22 models calculated with our new general - relativistic , radiation hydrodynamics , lagrangian code ( for details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pumo , zampieri & turatto 2010 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pumo & zampieri 2011 ) , pz11 ) .",
    "our models reproduce the luminosity - expansion velocity ( lev ) relation ( measured at 50 days from the explosion ) with an index equal to 3.13 @xmath0 0.29 , in good agreement with the value 3.03 @xmath0 0.37 found in the observational sample of hp02 . in order to overcome the difficulty of determining the phase at 50 days , that depends on the determination of the explosion time",
    ", we consider a lev relation where the reference epoch is t@xmath1 - 35 days ( left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , t@xmath1 being the time when the semi - logarithmic derivative of the bolometric light curve s = -dlog@xmath2l / dt has a local maximum at the end of the plateau phase .",
    "moreover , our models confirm the anti - correlation between the light curve slope at t@xmath1 and the amounts of @xmath3ni inferred by ecd03 on observational bases ( see also pz11 ) , and show the existence of a relationship between t@xmath1 and the bolometric luminosity l@xmath4 on the plateau measured at 30 days from the explosion ( mid panel in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a preliminary analysis shows a very promising calibration relation between the luminosity l@xmath5 at a generic time t@xmath5 during the plateau and the characteristic time t@xmath6=t@xmath7-t@xmath5 , where t@xmath7 is the time when l@xmath5 decreases by a factor 2.5 ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the correlations shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] represent useful tools for calibrating hydrogen - rich cc - sne using only photometric data . in particular , for type ii plateau sne ,",
    "the latter correlation is essentially independent of the explosion epoch ( see also pz11 ) .",
    "while all the correlations reported here were obtained for a rather restricted sample of models , we are working at present to check their validity against a more extended grid of models , as well as against observations that are being collected within the eso / tng large program `` supernova variety and nucleosynthesis yields '' ( pi : s.  benetti ) .",
