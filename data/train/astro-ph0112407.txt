    "however , the majority of these have been found by _",
    "hipparcos _ to be unresolved astrometric binaries with m - dwarf companions , and the remainder are unlikely to be brown dwarfs .",
    "this paucity of objects stands in stark contrast to the abundance of free - floating brown dwarfs in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in young clusters down to very low masses .",
    "an unanswered observational question is whether the brown dwarf desert exists at @xmath64  au , outside the region of current radial velocity surveys .",
    "a few l and t - dwarf companions have been found around fgk dwarfs from the 2mass imaging survey at very wide separations ( 2502500  au ) @xcite .",
    "the statistics are currently small , but this suggests the brown dwarf desert does not exists at very large separations @xcite .",
    "these companions might have formed during the fragmentation of the same natal molecular core as the primary . given their mass and large separation ,",
    "it is unlikely that they formed in a circumstellar disk , as planets are believed to form .",
    "little is known about the frequency of substellar companions at @xmath7450  au . in our solar system , this is the domain of giant planets and the kuiper belt .",
    "hence , probing these separations around other stars can test our understanding of formation processes in the outer regions of planetary systems .",
    "there are clues that massive planets and/or brown dwarfs do exist at these radii : half of stars with planets have systematic long - term trends in their radial velocities due to unseen companions @xcite .",
    "the orbital periods are much longer than the observing baselines , and hence the masses are poorly constrained . because the periods are many years and/or decades ,",
    "relying on radial velocities alone will require a long time to determine the companion masses .",
    "however , adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging with large ground - based telescopes can probe the physical nature of these companions and lend insight into the mass distribution of substellar and planetary companions .",
    "thus , ground - based ao imaging provides a key capability for finding substellar companions to main sequence stars , providing sensitivity at radii outside radial velocity searches but closer than ordinary imaging surveys .",

    "brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars are interesting in their own right .",

    "however , we know from the case of gl  86 that at least one brown dwarf co - exists with an extrasolar planet @xcite .",
    "the existence of hr  7672b and gl  86b indicates that brown dwarfs can form at separations comparable to circumstellar disks .",
    "( these objects are most likely substellar , or right at the substellar boundary . in the discussion which follows ,",
    "we assume for the sake of arugment that these are brown dwarfs . )",
    "a third possible example is the brown dwarf companion orbiting hd  168443 @xcite , at a semi - major axis of 3  au and with a mass between 17.2  ( from the radial velocities ) and 42  ( from limits on any astrometric wobble ) .",
    "this system also illustrates the gradual convergence of radial velocities and ao imaging , closing the mass gap for discovery of planets and brown dwarfs by indirect and direct means .",
    "formation scenarios for hr  7672b , and their connection with ones for extrasolar planets , remain an open question .",
    "current semantic convention designates planets as object below @xmath415  , with this border motivated either by the deuterium - burning limit for substellar objects or simply by the observed steep decline in frequency of such objects in radial velocity surveys @xcite ; more massive objects are considered brown dwarfs .",
    "hr  7672b would certainly be considered in the brown dwarf regime based on its estimated mass . @xcite",
    "have suggested brown dwarfs form as stellar embryos in small newborn multiple systems : they grow in mass by accretion of infalling gas , but their growth is prematurely truncated by ejection due to dynamical interactions .",
    "the discovery of hr  7672b is at variance with this scenario , since the ejection model discounts the existence of close separation brown dwarfs around solar - type stars .",
    "an additional criterion to distinguish planets from brown dwarfs under consideration is whether the object forms `` as planets do , '' presumably in a circumstellar disk , or instead as an isolated object . in this regard , objects like hr  7672b and gl  86b are interesting in that they resides in the zone of giant planet formation , i.e. , @xmath4  530  au where we know giant planets exist in our own solar system and theoretical models can most easily form them .",
    "giant planets are thought to form at these radii via gas accretion onto a rocky core .",
    "subsequent dynamical processes may cause them to migrate to smaller radii @xcite , since the @xmath24  au planets found by radial velocity surveys are not thought to have formed in situ .",
    "however , brown dwarfs are believed to be too massive to form by the same core accretion scenario as giant planets .",
    "instead , they may have originated , e.g. , by fragmentation during initial cloud collapse @xcite , by instabilities in a very massive disk @xcite , or by collisions between protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , brown dwarf companions are not found at small separations , but we now have strong evidence that they exist at @xmath415  au .",
    "this suggest they are immune to the migration process(es ) which affect massive planets .",
    "the discovery of brown dwarfs in the zone of giant planet formation implies that a diversity of physical processes act to populate the outer regions of exoplanetary systems .",
