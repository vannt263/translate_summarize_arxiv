    "the @xmath6 reaction is one of the most promising ways of studying the @xmath7 systems such as @xmath0-hypernuclei and a @xmath8 dibaryon . as for @xmath9 hypernuclei , although there are some hints of their existence from emulsion events , no @xmath9 bound state was unambiguously observed in the few experiments performed through the ( @xmath10 reaction on a @xmath11c target .",
    "however , in the near future experiments will be performed at jparc to search for the @xmath0-hypernuclei via the @xmath6 reaction with the best energy resolution of a few mev and with large statistics .",
    "the elementary cross sections for @xmath12 were measured in the 1960s and early 1970s using hydrogen bubble chambers . in a recent study  @xcite , this reaction was investigated within a single - channel effective lagrangian model where contributions were included from the @xmath13-channel ( fig .",

    "@xcite to study the elementary reaction , @xmath12 combined with the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite .",
    "we consider only the @xmath13-channel production diagrams ( fig .",
    "1b ) as we are interested in the region @xmath31 2 gev / c . the bound @xmath0 and proton spinors are calculated in the latest version of qmc model  @xcite . in this version , while the quality of results for @xmath15 and @xmath9 is comparable to that of the earlier qmc results  @xcite , no bound states for the @xmath16 states are found in middle and heavy mass nuclei .",
    "the latter is in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "this is facilitated by the extra repulsion associated with the increased one - gluon - exchange hyperfine interaction between the quarks in medium .",
    "the use of the bound spinors obtained in the qmc model provides an opportunity to investigate the role of the quark degrees of freedom in the @xmath0-hypernuclear production for the first time in studies of this system .",
    "since the @xmath0-hypernuclear production involves large momentum transfers ( 350 mev / c - 600 mev / c ) to the target nucleus , it is a good case for examining such short distance effects . in the qmc model  @xcite ,",
    "quarks within the non - overlapping nucleon bags , interact self - consistently with isoscalar - scalar ( @xmath32 ) and isoscalar - vector ( @xmath33 ) mesons in the mean field approximation .",
    "the explicit treatment of the nucleon internal structure is a key in the model .",
    "the self - consistent response of the bound quarks to the mean @xmath32 field leads to a new saturation mechanism for nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the qmc model has been used to study the properties of finite nuclei  @xcite , the binding of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 nuclei  @xcite and also the effect of the medium on @xmath37 and @xmath38 production  @xcite .",

    ", we compare our calculations with the total cross section data of @xmath12 for @xmath39 beam momenta ( @xmath40 ) below 3.5 gev / c .",
    "our model can describe well the beam momentum dependence of the elementary total cross section data within statistical errors .",
    "the measured total cross section peaks in the region of 1.35 - 1.4 gev / c which is well described by our model .    to calculate the cross sections for @xmath11c(@xmath28be and @xmath29si(@xmath30 mg , we have employed pure single - particle - single - hole @xmath41 wave functions to describe the nuclear structure part  @xcite , ignoring any configuration mixing effects .",
    "the amplitude involves the momentum space dirac - spinors of the bound @xmath0 and proton .",
    "we have used a plane wave approximation to describe the relative motion of @xmath39 ( @xmath42 ) in the incoming ( outgoing ) channel .",
    "however , the distortion effects are partially accounted for by introducing reduction factors to the cross sections as described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the thresholds for the @xmath11c@xmath43be and @xmath29si@xmath44 mg reactions are about 0.761 gev / c and 0.750 gev / c , respectively , and the momentum transfers involved at 0@xmath45 , vary between 1.8 - 2.9 @xmath46 .",
    "the initial states in both cases are doubly closed systems .",
    "the qmc model predicts only one bound state for the @xmath1be system with the @xmath0 - 1@xmath47 state binding energy of 3.038 mev . for the @xmath2 mg case ,",
    "it predicts three distinct bound @xmath0 states , 1@xmath47 , 1@xmath48 and 1@xmath49 , with the corresponding binding energies 8.982 , 4.079 and 4.414 mev , respectively .    in case of the @xmath11c target ,",
    "@xmath0 - 1@xmath47 state can populate 1@xmath50 and 2@xmath50 states of the hypernucleus corresponding to the particle - hole configuration @xmath51 .",
    "the states populated for the @xmath2 mg hypernucleus are , [ 2@xmath52 , 3@xmath52 ] , [ 1@xmath50 , 2@xmath50 , 3@xmath50 , 4@xmath50 ] , and [ @xmath55 , @xmath56 corresponding to the configurations @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively .    in fig .  2 ( right panel ) ,",
    "the 0@xmath45 differential cross sections are shown as a function of the beam momentum that are calculated by using the bound @xmath0 and proton spinors obtained in qmc ( solid lines ) as well as the phenomenological model ( dashed lines ) for @xmath11c@xmath43be and @xmath29si@xmath44 mg .",
    "we have shown results for populating the hypernuclear states with maximum spin and natural parity .",
    "although the relative motions of @xmath39 and @xmath42 mesons respectively in the initial and final channels are described by plane waves , the distortion effects for the absorption of the incoming @xmath39 are included by introducing factors that reduce the magnitudes of the cross sections .",
    "these factors are taken to be 2.8 and 5.0 for @xmath11c and @xmath29si targets , respectively as suggested in ref .",
    "this necessarily assumes that shapes of the angular distributions are not affected by the distortion effects .",
    "this aspect will be further investigated in a future study .    our results in fig .  2 ( right panel )",
    "show that for the both reactions , @xmath11c(@xmath28be and @xmath29si(@xmath30 mg , the cross sections peak at @xmath40 around 1.0 gev / c , which is about 0.25 - 0.26 gev / c above the corresponding production thresholds .",
    "this reflects the trends of the elementary @xmath0 production reaction , where the peaks of the elementary total cross section as well as the zero degree differential cross section occur at about 0.35 - 0.40 gev / c above the production threshold .",
    "furthermore , the magnitudes of the cross sections near the peak position are in excess of 1 @xmath60 .",
    "it is important in this context to note that the magnitude of our cross section for the @xmath11c target at a beam momentum of 1.6 gev / c is similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite within an impulse approximation model . moreover , our cross sections at 1.8 gev / c also are very close to those of ref .",
    "@xcite for the both targets .",
    "however , we fail to corroborate the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where cross sections were shown to peak for @xmath40 around 1.8 gev / c .",
    "it is quite probable that the distortion effects are dependent on the beam momenta and may be relatively stronger at lower values of @xmath40 .",
    "nevertheless , this is unlikely to lead to such a large shift in the peak position . in any case",
    ", this effect was not considered in ref .",
