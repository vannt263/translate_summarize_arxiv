    "recent technological advances in the manipulation of ultracold atoms on microscopic length scales have paved the way toward the exploration of scattering and transport phenomena with coherent interacting matter waves .",
    "key experiments in this context include the creation of flexible waveguide geometries with optical dipole beams @xcite and on atom chips @xcite , the coherent propagation of bose - einstein condensed atoms in such waveguides by means of guided atom lasers @xcite , the realization of optical billiard confinements @xcite and microscopic scattering and disorder potentials for cold atoms @xcite , as well as the detection of individual atoms within a condensate through photoionization on an atom chip @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was recently demonstrated @xcite that artificial gauge potentials can be induced for cold atoms , which lead to a breaking of time - reversal invariance in the same way as do magnetic fields for electrons . such artificial gauge potentials can , e.g. , be implemented by means of raman dressing with two laser beams that include a finite orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "together with the possibility of combining different atomic ( bosonic and fermionic ) species and of manipulating their interaction through feshbach resonances , the combination of these tools gives rise to a number of possible scattering and transport scenarios that are now ready for experimental investigation .",
    "a particularly prominent quantum transport phenomenon in mesoscopic physics is _ weak localization _ @xcite .",
    "this concept refers to an appreciable enhancement of the reflection ( or , in the solid - state context , of the electronic resistance ) in the presence of a two- or three - dimensional ballistic or disordered scattering region , as compared to the expectation based on a classical , i.e.  incoherent , transport process .",
    "this enhancement , which in turn implies a reduction of the transmission ( or of the electronic conductance ) due to current conservation , is in particular caused by `` coherent backscattering '' , i.e.  by the constructive interference between backscattered classical paths and their time - reversed counterparts , which was first observed in experiments on the scattering of laser light from disordered media @xcite . in the solid - state context",
    ", weak localization is most conveniently detected by measuring the electronic conductance in dependence of a weak magnetic field that is oriented perpendicular to the scattering region , such that it causes a dephasing between backscattered paths and their time - reversed counterparts .",
    "a characteristic peak structure at zero magnetic field is then typically observed @xcite .    from the electronic point of view",
    ", the presence of interaction between the particles that participate at this scattering process is generally expected to give rise to an additional dephasing mechanism of this subtle interference phenomenon @xcite . in the context of ultracold bosonic atoms ,",
    "this expectation is partly confirmed by previous theoretical studies on the coherent propagation of an interacting bose - einstein condensate through a two - dimensional disorder potential @xcite , which employed numerical simulations as well as diagrammatic representations based on the mean - field description of the condensate in terms of the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this study did indeed reveal a reduction of the height of the coherent backscattering peak with increasing effective interaction strength between the atoms .",
    "it also predicted , however , that this coherent backscattering peak might turn into a _ dip _ at finite ( but still rather small ) interaction strengths @xcite .",
    "this scenario is reminiscent of weak antilocalization due to spin - orbit interaction , which was observed in mesoscopic magnetotransport @xcite .    in order to gain a new perspective on this novel phenomenon , we investigate , in this work , the coherent propagation of bose - einstein condensates through ballistic scattering geometries that exhibit chaotic classical dynamics .",
    "such propagation processes can be experimentally realized by guided atom lasers in which the optical waveguides are locally `` deformed '' by means of additional optical potentials , e.g.  by focusing a red - detuned laser from a different direction onto this waveguide as was done in the experiment of ref .",
    "alternatively , atom chips @xcite or atom - optical billiards @xcite could be used in order to engineer chaotic scattering geometries for ultracold atoms . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the wave transport through such scattering geometries can be described using the semiclassical representation of the green function in terms of classical trajectories .",
    "the constructive interference of reflected trajectories with their time - reversed counterparts gives then rise to coherent backscattering @xcite , while a complete understanding of weak localization , in particular the corresponding reduction of the transmitted current , requires additional , classically correlated trajectory pairs @xcite .    in order to account for the presence of atom - atom interaction on the mean - field level of the nonlinear gross - pitaevskii equation",
    ", we combine , in this paper , the semiclassical approach with the framework of nonlinear diagrammatic theory developed in refs .  @xcite . for",
    "the sake of simplicity , we shall , as is described in section [ sec : setup ] , restrict ourselves to ideal chaotic billiard dynamics consisting of free motion that is confined by hard - wall boundaries .",
    "since such billiard geometries give rise to uniform average densities within the scattering region , we can , as demonstrated in sections [ sec : semi ] and [ sec : loop ] , derive explicit analytical expressions for the retro - reflection and transmission probabilities as a function of the effective interaction strength . as shown in section [ sec : comp ] , these expressions agree very well with the numerically computed retro - reflection and transmission probabilities for two exemplary billiard geometries as far as the deviation from the case of noninteracting ( single - particle ) transport is concerned . on the absolute scale ,",
    "however , the height of the weak localization peak is reduced in this noninteracting case by the presence of short - path contributions , in particular by self - retracing trajectories , which , as shown in section [ sec : comp ] , consequently turn this peak into a finite dip in the presence of a small interaction strength .",
    "we shall therefore argue in section [ sec : conc ] that such short - path contributions are at the origin of this weak antilocalization - like phenomenon .",
    "we consider the quasi - stationary transport of coherent bosonic matter waves through two - dimensional waveguide structures that are perturbed by the presence of a wide quantum - dot - like scattering potential .",
    "such propagating matter waves can be generated by means of a guided atom laser @xcite where ultracold atoms are coherently outcoupled from a trapping potential that contains a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the control of the outcoupling process , which , e.g. , can be achieved by applying a radiofrequency field that flips the spin of the atoms in the ( magnetic ) trap @xcite , permits one , in principle , to generate an energetically well - defined beam of atoms that propagate along the ( horizontally oriented ) waveguide in its transverse ground mode @xcite .",
    "this waveguide , as well as the quantum - dot - like scattering potential , can be engineered by means of focused red - detuned laser beams which provide an attractive effective potential for the atoms that is proportional to their intensity .",
    "the restriction to two spatial dimensions can , furthermore , be realized by applying , in addition , a tight one - dimensional optical lattice perpendicular to the waveguide ( i.e.  oriented along the vertical direction ) .",
    "the central object of study in this work is the phenomenon of weak localization . in the context of electronic mesoscopic physics ,",
    "this quantum interference phenomenon can be detected by measuring the electronic conductance , which is directly related to the quantum transmission through the landauer - bttiker theory @xcite , as a function of the strength of an externally applied magnetic field which breaks time - reversal invariance within the scattering region .",
    "such a time - reversal breaking mechanism can also be induced for cold atoms @xcite , e.g. , by coherently coupling two intra - atomic levels via a stirap process , using two laser beams of which one involves a nonvanishing orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to an effective vector potential in the kinetic term of the schrdinger equation , which is assumed such that it generates an effective `` magnetic field '' that is homogeneous within the scattering region and vanishes within the attached waveguides .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to investigate how the scenario of weak localization is affected by the presence of a weak atom - atom interaction within the matter - wave beam . in lowest order in the interaction strength",
    ", the presence of such an atom - atom interaction is accounted for by a nonlinear contribution to the effective potential in the schrdinger equation describing the motion of the atoms , which is proportional to the local density of atoms and which gives rise to the celebrated gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "the strength of this nonlinear contribution can be controlled by the scale of the confinement in the transverse ( vertical ) spatial direction .",
    "we shall make , in the following , the simplifying assumption that this nonlinearity is present only within the scattering region and vanishes within the waveguides .",
    "we furthermore assume that the waveguides are perfectly uniform , and that the two - dimensional scattering geometry can be described by perfect `` billiard '' potentials which combine a vanishing potential background within the waveguides and the scattering region with infinitely high hard walls along their boundaries .",
    "these assumptions considerably simplify the analytical and numerical treatment of the problem , and allow for the identification of well - defined asymptotic scattering states within the waveguides .",

    "we thereby encounter a signature of _ weak antilocalization _ in those billiards , which is of genuinely different nature than antilocalization in electronic transport processes involving spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "comparisons of the numerically computed absolute and relative heights of the weak localization peaks with the semiclassical prediction seem to suggest that this weak antilocalization - type phenomenon is caused by the occurrence of _ self - retracing _ trajectories in the scattering system .",
    "indeed , the presence of such self - retracing trajectories reduces the probability for coherent backscattering as compared to the universal semiclassical prediction in the linear case , as the application of the standard sum rule would give rise to an overcounting of interference contributions between backscattered trajectories and their time - reversed counterparts .",
    "it does , however , not affect the nonlinearity - induced corrections to this coherent backscattering probability .",
    "consequently , the peak of weak localization can turn into a finite dip in billiard geometries that exhibit prominent self - retracing trajectories of short length and therefore of large weight in the semiclassical backscattering amplitude .",
