    "particles , magnetic fields , and radiation all contribute to the propulsion of relativistic jets , though the relative contribution of each is still an open matter of debate . in certain situations ,",
    "however , the mechanism responsible for launching the jet operates simultaneously with the release of a large amount of energy in the form of radiation , making it likely that photons dominate the bulk energetics .",
    "this scenario occurs , for example , during the super - eddington phase of jetted tidal disruption events ( tdes ) , such as _ swift _ j1644 + 57 @xcite and _ swift _ j2058 + 05 @xcite .",
    "radiation - dominated jets should also be present in the collapsar picture of long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; @xcite ) , where the energy released in the form of gamma - rays is ultimately derived from accretion onto a black hole , the associated accretion luminosity exceeding the eddington limit of the hole by more than ten orders of magnitude . in both of these cases ,",
    "the propagation of the radiation - dominated jet is modulated by the presence of a radiation pressure - supported environment ; for super - eddington tdes , this environment is in the form of a highly inflated , quasi - spherical torus of fallback debris @xcite , while a `` cocoon '' of shocked jet material @xcite and the overlying stellar envelope itself @xcite serve as the confining medium for grbs .    in a companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper i )",
    ", we presented a model that describes the viscous interaction of a radiation - dominated , relativistic jet with its surrounding medium .",
    "in that analysis we treated the jet and its surroundings as two separate fluids , interacting with one another via small anisotropies in the comoving radiation field that are explicitly accounted for in the equations of radiation hydrodynamics in the viscous limit .",
    "this two - stream approximation , in agreement with the non - relativistic analysis of @xcite , demonstrates the manner in which the shear between the two fluids carves out a region of low density material within the boundary layer between them .",
    "we also deduced the dependence of the boundary layer thickness on the asymptotic properties of the jet and the ambient medium .",
    "these models also show , however , that the contact discontinuity separating the jet and its surroundings , necessary for maintaining their respective identities , results in the likely unphysical vanishing of the density of scatterers along that surface of separation .",
    "the contact discontinuity also prevents the jet from entraining ambient material ; since the jet in the two - stream model we considered had an infinite amount of momentum , any entrainment or lack thereof is formally inconsequential to the evolution of the system .",
    "however , realistic jets  those with finite extent  will almost certainly engulf more material as they expand into their surroundings ; because the total amount of momentum in the system , which is realistically finite , must be conserved , that entrainment will then result in an overall deceleration of the outflow that can not be captured in the two - stream model .    in view of these unphysical properties of the two - stream treatment  the vanishing of the mass density of scatterers along the contact discontinuity and the lack of entrainment  we present here an alternative boundary layer scenario to describe the interaction of a relativistic , radiation - dominated jet with its surroundings .",
    "this `` free - streaming jet '' model , which has a well - known counterpart in the non - relativistic , incompressible limit ( see chapter 10 , section 12 of @xcite ) , assumes that the jet is injected through a narrow opening into a static , homogenous medium , and that far enough from that opening the entire system can be modeled as a single fluid that is independent of the details at the injection point . by considering the jet and the ambient medium as one fluid",
    "we obviate the need for a contact discontinuity , which we demonstrate allows the density of scatterers to remain finite throughout the flow and for the jet to entrain material .",
    "in section 2 of this paper we present the equations of radiation hydrodynamics in the viscous limit .",
    "section 3 uses those equations to analyze the free - streaming jet model , and we demonstrate the existence of approximate self - similar solutions in the limit that the interaction between the jet and the ambient medium is concentrated in a thin boundary layer . in section 4",
    "we discuss the implications of our model and make comparisons to the two - stream scenario , and in section 5 we conclude and consider the application of the free - streaming jet model to super - eddington tdes , grbs , and other astronomical sources .",
    "when changes in fluid quantities over the mean free path of a photon are small , radiation behaves like an effective viscosity and transfers momentum and energy between neighboring fluid elements .",
    "the precise form of the viscosity can be determined by investigating the general relativistic boltzmann equation , which was recently done by @xcite for the case where thomson scattering dominates the interactions between the photons and scatterers in the fluid rest frame . in this limit",

    "the goal of the next two sections is to apply equations and  to the boundary layers established between fast - moving jets and their ambient media . for a more thorough discussion of the nature of the equations of radiation hydrodynamics in the viscous limit , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "in this section we consider the problem where a narrow stream of material is continuously injected into a plane - parallel , static , ambient medium , known as the free - streaming jet problem .",
    "if the reynolds number of the outflow is high , the transition between the stream of material and the external environment will be confined to a thin layer , permitting the use of a boundary layer approximation .",
    "the basic setup is similar to that of the two - stream problem ( see paper i ) , with the motion of the 2-d , plane - parallel injected stream predominantly along the @xmath20-direction , the majority of the variation along @xmath21 , no variation or velocity in @xmath22 , and the point of injection at @xmath23 . now , however , there is no contact discontinuity between the stream and the ambient environment , meaning that the entire system is considered a single fluid .",
    "we therefore have less freedom in prescribing the asymptotic characteristics of the jet and the environment ; however , this configuration permits mixing between the two media , allowing the outflow to entrain material , which almost certainly occurs in realistic jets .",
    "we can reduce the complexity of equations and by assuming that the interaction between the jet and the ambient medium takes place over a thin boundary layer of thickness @xmath24 , thin in the sense that @xmath25 is a small number when @xmath26 is a typical length along the jet . in this case",

    "because it will be convenient , we will change variables from @xmath21 to @xmath44 , where @xmath44 is given by    @xmath45    which is related to the optical depth across the boundary layer as measured from the axis . in terms of this variable , equations and",

    "it should also be noted that the @xmath21-component of the convective derivative is now with respect to @xmath44 , not @xmath21 , i.e. ,    @xmath48    in the ensuing section we will seek self - similar solutions to these equations .",
    "we can immediately solve the continuity equation by introducing the stream function @xmath49 via    @xmath50    @xmath51    where the factor of @xmath3 ensures that @xmath49 remains dimensionless .",
    "in paper i we showed that there exist self - similar solutions for @xmath49 , the velocity , the comoving density of scatterers and comoving density of photons in terms of the variable @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "one difference between the two - stream problem and this type of outflow , however , is that we expect the jet to expand into the ambient medium , entraining material in the process .",
    "therefore , as we look farther along the @xmath20-direction , the amount of inertia  predominantly in the form of radiation for the systems that we are considering  contained in the flow will increase .",
    "owing to the conservation of momentum , the @xmath20-component of the velocity should thus be a decreasing function of @xmath20 .    in light of this observation",
    ", we will assume that the @xmath20-component of the four - velocity scales as    @xmath54    where @xmath32 is a characteristic length scale in the @xmath20-direction , @xmath55 is a positive constant , for brevity we defined @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is a function of the self - similar variable @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is the characteristic boundary layer thickness in terms of @xmath44 , which , from equations and in the previous subsection , is given by @xmath60 , or    @xmath61    we are most interested in the behavior of the properties of the outflow when the velocities are relativistic , as this is the limit that is most applicable to sources of astronomical interest , and in order for the self - similar nature of our solutions to be upheld , the dependence of our self - similar functions on the bulk properties of the outflow , such as the @xmath20-dependence of the jet lorentz factor along the axis , should be minimal .",
    "a fully self - similar solution is likely impossible here , as the speed of light plays a role in setting a finite scale factor for our solutions and becomes problematic when we try to connect the ultra- and non - relativistic regions of the outflow .",
    "we will show , however , that the non - self - similarity of our solutions only affects a small region of the outflow .",
    "in paper i , we showed that the self - similarity of the comoving density of scatterers , @xmath1 , was approximately satisfied , i.e. , we could find solutions with @xmath62 .",
    "for the case at hand , then , this assumption implies that @xmath63 is independent of @xmath64 .",
    "this means , however , that the observer - frame density of scatterers , given by @xmath65 , can be made arbitrarily large ( as @xmath63 is independent of @xmath64 in the self - similar limit ) , which is a nonsensical result .    motivated by this reasoning",
    ", we conclude that the comoving density of scatterers is unlikely to be independent of @xmath64 . on the contrary",
    ", a more reasonable approximation is that the _ observer_-frame density of scatterers varies self - similarly .",
    "investigating equations and , we see that the @xmath1-dependent quantity that enters both is the combination @xmath66 .",
    "our expectation that the observer - frame density varies self - similarly then prompts the assumption    @xmath67    where @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the density of scatterers in the ambient medium .",
    "( note that we could have simply let @xmath70 , but equation , which is merely a change of variables from the initial assignment @xmath70 , will allow equations and to be written in a more compact form . )",
    "we can determine the value of @xmath55 , which controls how rapidly the flow decelerates due to entrainment , by integrating the momentum flux , @xmath71 for a radiation - dominated system , over the entire boundary layer , and requiring that the result be independent of @xmath20 .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring that the total momentum contained in the outflow be conserved . integrating @xmath72 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , using equations and , taking the ultrarelativistic limit and changing variables from @xmath21 to @xmath75 , we find    @xmath76    since the integral in this equation is a constant that is greater than zero , we find that @xmath77 if the momentum flux is conserved",

    "changing variables from @xmath44 to @xmath75 and performing a bit of algebra , we find that they become , respectively ,    @xmath84    @xmath85    now , the solutions we seek for @xmath57 and @xmath63 should depend only on @xmath75 , as otherwise our assumption of the self - similarity of those functions breaks down .",
    "because of the complicated dependence of @xmath86 on @xmath87 , we see that the solutions will not be self - similar for arbitrary @xmath88 .",
    "however , in the ultrarelativistic limit , for which @xmath89 , we see that @xmath90 , and it is apparent that the solutions are indeed self - similar , i.e. , the @xmath64 dependence of equations and drops out .    as these equations are third order in @xmath57 and first order in @xmath63 , we require four boundary conditions to solve them numerically . since @xmath87 is given by equation and it is assumed that @xmath91 along the axis , our first boundary condition is given by @xmath92 . for the second , we note that the jet axis is the streamline along which the @xmath21-component of the velocity is zero . from equation ,",
    "then , we find @xmath93 ( we will see that @xmath94 at @xmath95 ) . the third boundary condition is obtained by noting that the @xmath20-component of the velocity should approach zero as we proceed into the ambient medium , so that , from equation , we find @xmath96 . finally , the density of scatterers should approach that of the ambient medium far from the jet center .",
    "equation then gives @xmath97 .",
    "as we noted , the truly self - similar limit of equations and is obtained by setting @xmath98 , but we encounter an issue with this scaling when we consider the boundary conditions on our flow in the ambient medium .",
    "in particular , we expect the outflow velocity to approach zero for @xmath99 ; when the velocity becomes subrelativistic , however , @xmath100 , when in actuality the @xmath101 limit of equation is @xmath102 .",
    "thus , we see that taking the ultrarelativistic limit of equations and will not result in the solutions matching the correct boundary conditions far from the jet center .    to correct this problem , we will allow the function @xmath86 to take on its full form and treat @xmath64 as a constant , which will break the self - similarity of our solutions .",
    "however , since our boundary conditions do not depend on the value of @xmath64 , the functions @xmath57 and @xmath63 themselves should be largely independent of that parameter .",
    "we therefore expect the assumption of self - similarity to be upheld in the ultrarelativistic ( @xmath103 ) and the non - relativistic ( @xmath99 ) limits of our solutions , with small deviations from self - similarity in the trans - relativistic regime of the outflow .    , which is the normalized @xmath20-component of the four - velocity , with @xmath75 for @xmath104 ( blue , solid curve ) , @xmath105 ( purple , dot - dashed curve ) , and @xmath106 ( red , dashed curve ) .",
    "as expected , the curves are all coincident when @xmath103 and @xmath99 , with a non - self - similar transition ( one that depends on @xmath64 ) in between those two limits.,width=336 ]    , which is approximately the inverse of the lab - frame density , plotted with respect to @xmath75 for the same set of @xmath64 chosen in figure [ fig : fpsims ] . as was true for @xmath107 , @xmath63 is approximately self - similar close to and far from the jet , with the deviation from self - similarity in the trans - relativistic region being apparent but small.,width=336 ]    to exemplify this point , figures [ fig : fpsims ] and [ fig : gsims ] show , respectively , the variation of @xmath107  the normalized @xmath20-component of the four - velocity  and @xmath63  approximately the inverse of the observer - frame density  in terms of the parameter @xmath75 for @xmath108 and 25 .",
    "as we anticipated , the functions for different @xmath64 are indistinguishable for @xmath103 and @xmath99 , meaning that the self - similarity is nearly exact in those regions . in between those limits , where the flow is trans - relativistic , the deviations from self - similarity are apparent , though they remain small . keeping the full form of @xmath86 in equations and therefore preserves well the self - similarity of our solutions and provides a reasonable interpolation between the relativistic and non - relativistic regions of the flow .",
    "the solution for @xmath63 approaches infinity as we near the axis , which can be seen by investigating the small-@xmath75 behavior of equation .",
    "specifically , letting @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 , equation can be written as    @xmath113    where @xmath114 is the second derivative of @xmath57 evaluated at @xmath95 .",
    "this equation can be integrated , and we find    @xmath115    @xmath116 being a constant of integration .",
    "since it is roughly proportional to @xmath117 , the value of @xmath63 can not be negative , meaning that @xmath116 must be greater than zero .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic , @xmath103 behavior of @xmath63 is @xmath118 .",
    "in addition to the mass density of scatterers and the velocity , we can also calculate the number density of photons , @xmath19 , throughout the boundary layer .",
    "as we showed in paper i , the equation of photon number conservation becomes , to lowest order in the boundary layer thickness ,    @xmath119    performing a few manipulations , this equation becomes    @xmath120    as was true for the density of scatterers , we expect the observer frame number density of photons to vary approximately self - similarly , which will be true if we let    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the number density of photons in the ambient medium and @xmath123 is a dimensionless function .",
    "inserting this ansatz into equation gives    @xmath124    for the boundary conditions on @xmath123 , we first require that the number density of photons approach that of the ambient medium in the @xmath99 limit .",

    "doing so yields    @xmath127    the right - hand side can be determined by returning to the continuity equation , integrating from @xmath73 to @xmath74 and performing a few manipulations to show that @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the function @xmath57 evaluated at infinity . using the definition of @xmath19 in terms of @xmath123",
    ", we find that equation becomes    @xmath130    which serves as our second boundary condition on @xmath123 .",

    "this expression also shows that    @xmath136    which we can use in equation to give    @xmath137    equation also confirms that @xmath94 when @xmath95 , which we used in order to determine the boundary condition @xmath93 .",

    "for @xmath149 , each solution initially has a positive @xmath150 , which shows that the jet material expands away from the axis .",
    "the @xmath21-component of the three - velocity then reaches a relative maximum , one which increases slightly for larger @xmath88 , before approaching a negative , constant value .",
    "this behavior is then inverted for negative @xmath75 . because the transverse velocity approaches a negative constant for @xmath151 and a positive constant for @xmath152",
    ", we see that the jet entrains material from the ambient medium .    , which is the normalized @xmath20-component of the four - velocity , for @xmath105 and @xmath153 , 1 , and 10 , which correspond to the blue , solid curve , the purple , dot - dashed curve , and the red , dashed curve , respectively .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath138 , we see , has little effect on the solution , while decreasing @xmath138 drastically widens the boundary layer.,width=336 ]     chosen in figure [ fig : fpplotsmujet ] .",
    "the mean value of the density decreases as @xmath138 decreases.,width=336 ]     chosen in figure [ fig : fpplotsmujet ] .",
    "this figure demonstrates , as we saw in figure [ fig : hplotsgamjet ] , that the density of photons tracks that of the scatterers.,width=336 ]    -component of the three - velocity , normalized by @xmath148 , for the same set of @xmath138 chosen in figure [ fig : fpplotsmujet ] .",
    "we see that the relative maximum increases for smaller @xmath138.,width=336 ]    figures [ fig : fpplotsmujet ]  [ fig : vyplotsmujet ] illustrate how our solutions depend on @xmath138 .",
    "as is apparent , changing the value of @xmath138 does not drastically alter the qualitative aspects of the functions .",
    "we do see , however , that decreasing @xmath138 from 1 to 0.1 results in a large increase in the boundary layer thickness ; on the contrary , changing @xmath138 from 1 to 10 results in only a slight narrowing of its thickness .",
    "it is also evident that a smaller @xmath138 compared to 1 results in a lower average value of the density throughout the boundary layer and a larger peak in the transverse velocity @xmath150 .",
    "figures [ fig : fpplotsgamjet ]  [ fig : vyplotsgamjet ] demonstrate that the width of the boundary layer is nearly independent of @xmath64 , which is the result of the scaling of our boundary layer thickness @xmath27 .",
    "specifically , note from equation that @xmath27 is given by @xmath154 . since our ansatz posited that @xmath155 , with @xmath63 a dimensionless function of order unity , and @xmath156 for @xmath157 , the boundary layer thickness is roughly independent of @xmath64 .",
    "figures [ fig : fpplotsmujet ]  [ fig : vyplotsmujet ] illustrate that a value of @xmath158 causes the boundary layer thickness to increase dramatically compared to @xmath141 , while setting @xmath159 causes only a slight narrowing of the width compared to @xmath141 .",
    "this dependence is due to the fact that the viscous heating , which increases the specific entropy by decreasing the density of scatterers ( at fixed pressure ) , is most efficient when the flow is compressible , as is evident from the gas energy equation . the fluid only becomes compressible , however , when the flow is supersonic , and we can show @xcite that the sound speed of a radiation - dominated gas is    @xmath160    when @xmath161 , the sound speed reduces to @xmath162 , and the location at which the flow becomes transsonic extends farther into the ambient medium , widening the boundary layer .",
    "conversely , when @xmath163 , the sound speed approaches a constant @xmath164 , which results in only a slight narrowing of the boundary layer .",
    "equation shows that the energy density of the radiation , and hence the pressure , is constant across the jet , which is a statement of the causal connectedness of the boundary layer . in order for this equation to remain valid , then , we require that the transverse sound crossing time over the boundary layer thickness @xmath24 be less than the time it takes the fluid to traverse the distance @xmath26 . since the transverse sound speed is given @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is given by equation , this requirement yields the inequality @xmath167 .",
    "once this inequality is no longer satisfied , equation does not hold , and we must include more terms in equations  to account for the gradients in the energy density of the radiation .    as we noted in section 3 ,",
    "the density approaches zero as we near the axis of the jet .",
    "physically , this effect arises from the fact that , for @xmath168 , the lorentz factor grows unbounded and the boundary layer thickness goes to zero .",
    "therefore , the center of the jet originates along a curve of infinite shear and , consequently , infinite entropy . since the specific entropy scales as @xmath169 and @xmath2 is constant across the boundary layer , we see that the density of scatterers must equal zero at the center of the jet .    from figures [ fig : vyplotsgamjet ] and [ fig :",
    "vyplotsmujet ] , we see that the @xmath21-component of the velocity initially causes the outflow to expand into its surroundings .",
    "when @xmath170 becomes large , however , the directionality of @xmath150 reverses toward the jet .",
    "the outflow therefore entrains material from the ambient medium not only by expanding in the transverse direction , but also by dragging material in from the environment .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath21-component of the velocity approaches a non - zero , constant value as we move into the external medium .",
    "this behavior arises from the fact that the jet is removing material from the system at a rate @xmath171 , showing that amount of mass excavated from the envelope increases as we move along @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , in order to maintain a steady - state , we require a constant influx of material at infinity that can resupply the amount lost due to the jet .",
    "this interpretation is substantiated by integrating the continuity equation from @xmath73 to @xmath172 , which shows that the @xmath21-component of the velocity at infinity scales as @xmath173 .",
    "the factor of @xmath174 arises from the fact that the mass loss rate scales as @xmath175 ; therefore , if one could decrease the mass loss rate to one that was constant in @xmath20 , then the @xmath21-component of the velocity would vanish at infinity .",
    "likewise , if one could create a scenario in which @xmath176 scaled as a _ negative _ power of @xmath20 , then the value of @xmath177 would maintain an efflux of material at infinity to keep the system from amassing inertia towards the center of the jet ( thus violating the steady - state assumption ) .",
    "the free - streaming jet solutions analyzed in this paper are only valid when the lorentz factor is relativistic , i.e. , when @xmath178 .",
    "when @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and we can show that conservation of momentum along the @xmath20-axis results in the scaling @xmath182 , @xmath183 , which agrees with the results of the incompressible , non - relativistic theory ( in chapter 10 , section 12 of @xcite , see their discussion at the top of page 383 ) .",
    "therefore , once @xmath184 , the outflow will undergo a non - self - similar transition from the solution presented here to its non - relativistic counterpart .",
    "the free - streaming jet model has observational consequences .",
    "for example , the decrease in the density along the jet axis means that observers looking down the barrel of the jet see farther into the outflow . because @xmath185 and @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the lab - frame radiation energy density , this means that those observers see a higher energy density of photons .",
    "also , those same observers , using the fact that the lab - frame radiation number density is @xmath188 , see an energy per photon of @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , not only do the on - axis observers see a more lorentz - boosted spectrum because they can see deeper into the outflow , their spectrum is also hardened from the fact that @xmath19 is minimized along the axis of the jet ( where @xmath190 in the figures of section 3 ) .",
    "paper i analyzed how the presence of a radiation pressure - supported envelope affected the propagation of a radiation - dominated , relativistic jet through the two - stream approximation .",
    "this approximation treats the jet and its surroundings as semi - infinite , separate fluids , a contact discontinuity serving as the surface of separation between the two .",
    "in contrast , the free - streaming jet solution presented here treats the entire system  the jet and its surroundings  as a single fluid .",
    "there is thus no formal distinction between `` jet material '' and `` ambient material , '' meaning that no contact discontinuity exists in the system .    by comparing figure 1 of paper i and",
    "figure [ fig : fpplotsgamjet ] of the previous section , we see that the @xmath20-component of the four - velocity at a fixed @xmath20 behaves similarly between the two models .",
    "namely , the solution starts at some `` jet '' velocity , which corresponds to @xmath172 in the two - stream model and to @xmath191 in the jet model , and smoothly transitions to a velocity of approximately zero over the extent of a few boundary layer thicknesses",
    ". however , the full spatial dependence of the velocity , one that includes variation in the @xmath20-direction , differs drastically between the two models : while the two - stream jet maintains a constant @xmath88 along @xmath20 , we found here that the @xmath20-component of the four - velocity scales as @xmath192 , implying that the overall velocity of the jet slows as we look farther down @xmath20 .",
    "this behavior arises from the fact that the free - streaming jet can entrain material , this entrainment causing an increase in the inertia contained in the outflow and a resultant decrease in its velocity .",
    "the general behavior of the number densities of scatterers and photons between the models is also similar , which can be understood by comparing figures 2 and 3 of paper i to figures [ fig : rhoplotsgamjet ] and [ fig : hplotsgamjet ] of section 3 , respectively .",
    "in particular , both densities decrease within the boundary layer separating the outflow and its surroundings , asymptotically approaching their jet values as @xmath193 in the two - stream model and as @xmath194 in the free - streaming jet model . likewise , each approaches its ambient value as @xmath195 in the two - stream model and as @xmath196 in the free - streaming jet model .",
    "although the gross properties of both are similar , one striking difference arises , however , in the behavior of the scatterer density : in the two - stream model , the existence of the contact discontinuity causes the function @xmath63 , and hence the density @xmath1 , to vanish within the boundary layer ( it vanishes specifically at @xmath191  the location of the contact discontinuity ) .",
    "conversely , @xmath1 remains non - zero throughout the boundary layer that connects the jet and its surroundings in the model presented here , and only as we near the center of the jet does the density of scatterers go to zero .",
    "the presence of a contact discontinuity thus results in the likely non - physical vanishing of the massive particles within the boundary layer .",
    "finally , the scaling of the boundary layer thickness itself differs between the two models . in the two - stream case",
    ", we found that @xmath197 ( see equation ( 15 ) of paper i ) .",
    "therefore , as one looks farther down the @xmath20-axis , the boundary layer that develops between the jet and the ambient environment extends into both media at a rate proportional to @xmath198 .",
    "contrarily , equation shows that the free - streaming jet boundary layer expands into its surroundings as @xmath199 ( though this transitions to @xmath200 in the non - relativistic limit ; see the discussion at the top of page 383 in chapter 10 , section 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "the free - streaming jet boundary layer thus expands more rapidly than does the two - stream solution .",
    "employing the equations of radiation hydrodynamics in the viscous limit , which are applicable as long as changes in fluid quantities are small over the mean free path of a photon , we analyzed the dynamics of a relativistic , free - streaming jet under the boundary layer approximation .",
    "this approximation , which should be upheld in jets with transverse optical depths substantially greater than one , states that variations in the properties of the outflow are confined to a thin layer of width @xmath27 , and it allowed us to transform the full set of equations  into a set of greatly simplified boundary layer equations  .",
    "perhaps the biggest difference between the two - stream solutions , presented and analyzed in paper i , and the free - streaming jet solutions presented here is in the distinction between the jet and the ambient medium . in the former ,",
    "the two are considered as distinct , interacting entities , which allows one to specify separately their asymptotic properties .",
    "the latter approach , on the other hand , considers the whole configuration as a single fluid .    because one has more freedom in specifying the properties of the outflow , the two - stream solution has the added benefit of being able to treat scenarios in which the properties of the jet and the ambient medium differ significantly .",
    "however , maintaining the distinction between the two media necessitates the existence of a surface of contact between the two across which no fluid can flow , meaning that the jet can not entrain ambient material .",
    "furthermore , as was demonstrated in paper i , this boundary condition results in the density formally vanishing at the interface , which is likely non - physical .    by treating the outflow and the environment as one fluid , we demonstrated that entrainment does occur in the radiation - viscous , free - streaming jet solution , which causes the @xmath20-component of the four - velocity of the jet to slow as @xmath201 ( this power - law , however , may differ if the adopted symmetry is azimuthal as opposed to planar ; see below ) .",
    "these solutions also show that the comoving densities of scatterers and photons decrease dramatically within the boundary layer , with the density of scatterers approaching zero as one nears the center of the jet . therefore , because observers that look `` down the barrel of the jet '' can see farther into the outflow , they see a more lorentz - boosted energy density than those that view the outflow off - axis .",
    "they also observe a higher energy per photon , given by @xmath202 , both because @xmath19 is minimized along the axis and because @xmath203 , the observed lorentz factor , is larger .",
    "such features are in qualitative agreement with the event _ swift _ j1644 + 57 , where such an observer orientation is invoked to explain the x - ray emission @xcite .    in addition to super - eddington tdes and long grbs ( as well as the relatively new class of `` ultra - long '' grbs ; @xcite )  the two applications considered in the introduction  the free - streaming jet model could be applied to other sources .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , this model may also be relevant to microquasars @xcite ( particularly those that fall in the class of ulx s ; @xcite ) such as the object ss 433 ( @xcite ; see @xcite for an application of the two - stream model to this source ) . additionally , a jetted quasi - star ",
    "a protogalactic gas cloud supported by a supercritically accreting black hole @xcite  provides another situation in which a radiation - dominated jet propagates alongside a radiation pressure - supported envelope .",
    "the free - streaming jet solution presented here is limited to describing plane - parallel , two - dimensional systems .",
    "one consequence of this assumption is that the entrainment of material , which slows down the jet as @xmath185 , happens effectively in one dimension .",
    "if , on the other hand , one imposed azimuthal symmetry and described the system in terms of spherical coordinates @xmath204 , which is likely more relevant for realistic jetted systems , the entrainment would occur in two dimensions .",
    "other conditions being equal , the slowing of the jet along the axis would then be more pronounced , i.e. , the lorentz factor would scale as @xmath205 with @xmath206 .",
    "the other main assumption of the free - streaming jet model presented here is that the energy density of the ambient medium is independent of @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "if a pressure gradient were present , this force would tend to accelerate ( or , in principle , decelerate ) the jet material , offsetting the power - law scaling @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , one can imagine that if the pressure gradient were strong enough , it could indeed reverse the overall slowing of the jet and cause the outflow to accelerate .",
    "if the energy density scaled as @xmath207 , which is relevant for super - eddington tdes as long as the constant @xmath208 satisfies @xmath209 @xcite , this situation could be actualized near the launch point of the jet .    in an ensuing paper ,",
    "we plan to compare more quantitatively the predictions made by the free - streaming jet model presented here and the observations of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 .",
    "we will also extend our analysis to incorporate a spherical geometry  as azimuthal symmetry is almost certainly more relevant for this and other systems than the planar symmetry adopted here  as well as radially - dependent ambient pressure and density profiles .",
