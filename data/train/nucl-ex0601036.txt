    "this was an excellent conference . for the fourth consecutive time since the beginning of rhic operation in the year 2000 , the quark matter conference displayed the strong vitality and enormous productivity of the field . a few facts and numbers",
    "easily prove this point . since the last conference in oakland 19 months ago , ( i ) there have been two very successful additional runs at rhic , run-4 and run-5 , basically completing a broad survey of the physics landscape not only in au+au collisions at the top rhic energy of @xmath0=200 gev but also at a lower energy , 62 gev and in a lighter system , cu+cu at @xmath0=200 , 62 and 22.5 gev , and including the crucial reference runs p+p and d+au at 200 gev , ( ii ) i counted 87 papers published in the refereed literature , 30 of them in phys .",
    "lett . , ( iii ) monumental white papers @xcite based on the first three years of rhic operation , were published by the four rhic experiments reflecting their assessment on the nature of the matter formed at rhic and a new logo was born , the `` perfect fluid '' .",
    "all this and numerous new experimental results from rhic and sps formed the core of the 25 and 60 experimental talks given in plenary and parallel sessions , respectively , which i shall try to summarize here .",
    "the last three quark matter conferences were naturally dominated by rhic data , more precisely rhic data on global event characterization ( multiplicity , flow , hbt , fluctuations , kinetic and chemical equilibrium ) and the newly discovered high p@xmath1 phenomena .",
    "this conference was also dominated by rhic data . but with the advent of results from the high luminosity runs , the emphasis moved to penetrating and rare probes ( charm , charmonium , dileptons and photons ) .",
    "high p@xmath1 phenomena and jet physics remained a very strong topic .",
    "it is also noteworthy that first results were presented from the cu+cu run-5 which ended just a few months prior of the conference .",
    "the timely release of results is an impressive feature characteristic of all rhic runs so far .",
    "this remarkable achievement would not be possible without the dedication and enthusiasm of many young ( and not so young ) and brilliant researchers who for several months worked literally around the clock , forgetting week - ends and other obligations , to bring their analyses to the high level required at this conference .",
    "i wish to pay tribute to all of them here .",
    "in addition to the rhic data , we have also seen results from na60 , a second generation experiment at the cern sps devoted to the measurement of the dimuon spectrum from the low - masses up to the j/@xmath2 . with its two main characteristic features , excellent mass resolution and high statistics ,",
    "na60 presented superb data from its first run ( that unfortunately also seems to be its last one ) on in+in at 158  agev .    in coming to summarize this conference",
    ", it is obviously impossible to do justice to all the new results presented .",
    "this summary presents a broad choice , but it is a personal one , and i apologize to all the speakers whose results i could not include in the limited space of this summary .",
    "we have seen at this conference many new results on flow mainly from rhic but also from sps .",
    "perhaps the most striking result is that open charm , inferred from measurements of inclusive electrons after subtraction of hadron decays , exhibits elliptic flow of comparable magnitude to that of hadrons .",
    "this result and the challenge to energy loss models will be discussed in section  [ sec : heavy - flavor ] .",
    "elliptic flow measurements at rhic have been reported for many new particles , including heavy and rare particles , in particular d and multistrange hadrons , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : star - wangfig4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "so far , _ all _ hadrons measured at rhic show elliptic flow .",
    "the only notable particle where no results are as yet available is the .",
    "i shall return to the importance of this missing measurement again in section  [ sec : jpsi ] .     for strange ( left ) and multi - strange ( right ) hadrons measured by star in au+au collisions at = 200 gev .",
    "the curves are empirical fits .",

    "the elliptic flow flattens and the hydrodynamic description breaks down as shown e.g. in fig .",

    "deviations are seen at low  where the hydrodynamic description works best but at intermediate  quark scaling works .",
    "this suggests that quarks are the relevant degrees of freedom very early in the collision , when flow takes place .",

    "the two are in good agreement with each other . at low ,  increases",
    "monotonically , as at rhic energies , but the absolute values are lower at the sps and hydrodynamic calculations can not simultaneously reproduce particle spectra and flow .",
    "when constrained to reproduce the particle spectra , the hydrodynamic calculations overestimate the amount of flow .",
    "what new information could be gained by studying different systems at the same energy ?",
    "this question has come up repeatedly over the years .",
    "proponents have proposed this as an additional knob to turn for the systematic study of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "clearly the initial geometrical overlap volume in central cu+cu collisions has not the same shape as in au+au collisions at the selected centrality corresponding to the same number of participants .",
    "but if the system quickly expands and reaches thermal equilibrium , this difference could rapidly be erased from the collision memory .",
    "therefore opponents have argued that going to lighter systems would be equivalent to study a heavier one as function of centrality .",
    "the many new results from the recent cu+cu run at rhic provided a clear answer : cu+cu is very similar to au+au when the two systems are compared for collisions with the same number of participants . a very nice example is shown in fig .",

    "the two distributions are almost identical when the centrality bins are chosen to correspond to the same number of participants . the same holds true for other centralities and also at  = 62.4 gev @xcite .",
    "many other examples supporting this argument were provided by the four rhic experiments ( see @xcite ) .",
    "i shall mention two more : phobos @xcite showed that the elliptic flow  relative to the participant eccentricity scales with  irrespective of the collision system ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the  production also scales with the number of participants and this was demonstrated by the phenix results obtained in au+au and cu+cu collisions ( see section  [ sec : jpsi ] ) and also at sps in a comparison of the pb+pb and in+in results from na50 and na60 , respectively .",

    "the gluon density is smaller at forward rapidity and consequently one would expect a lower suppression . as a possible explanation one could argue that at forward rapidity , other mechanisms are present , like gluon saturation as manifest in d+au measurements , that could lead to an additional suppression such that by accident the total suppression looks similar to the one at mid - rapidity @xcite .",
    "a quantitative analysis incorporating all effects in a comprehensive theoretical approach is needed .",
    "with the availability of large data sets it is now possible to study particle correlations over a large range of  values both for the trigger as well as for the associated particles .",
    "each selection of kinematic cuts provides a slice of the jet structure and reveals limited but valuable information .",
    "combining all these selections together should eventually lead to a detailed reconstruction of the jet topology and its interaction with the medium allowing complete tomography of the matter created at rhic .",
    "first jet studies at rhic provided the by now classical result of the away - side jet disappearance in central au+au at high   values ( @xmath21 gev / c and @xmath22 gev / c ) @xcite .",
    "this dramatic result reflects the limited ability to extract the suppressed away - side jet from the high background in this particular kinematic cut rather than a real disappearance of the jet .",
    "if one includes softer associated particles ( 0.15 @xmath23 gev / c while keeping the same trigger @xmath21 gev / c ) , the correlation strength grows faster than the background and a clear and broad away - side peak appears as shown in recent studies @xcite .",
    "from these two observations a picture emerges which is fully compatible with parton energy loss in a high - density medium : the hadron trigger preferentially selects a dijet produced near to the surface . the parton heading outwards gives rise to an almost unaffected near - side jet that fires the trigger whereas the recoiling parton looses energy while traversing the medium and its momentum gets redistributed over several particles , suppressing high  particles ( disappearance of away side peak in @xcite ) and enhancing low  particles ( broad away side peak in @xcite ) .",

    "however , the limited azimuthal acceptance in the central arms and the strong magnetic radial field beginning at the vertex , make the identification and rejection of the relatively large number of electron - positron pairs from dalitz decays and photon conversions very difficult , resulting in an overwhelming combinatorial background . in the present set - up",
    "the signal to background s / b ratio for masses m = 0.2 - 0.5 gev / c@xmath38 is smaller than 1/100 as illustrated in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix - alberica ] @xcite .",
    "phenix has mastered the background subtraction technique to a very high level of precision ( @xmath370.25% ) . but with a s / b @xmath47 1/100 this is not sufficient .",
    "the statistical significance of the measurement is largely reduced and the systematic uncertainty is large preventing any conclusive interpretation of the data .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phenix - alberica ] shows the background subtracted spectrum compared to a pure cocktail of expected sources ( hadronic decays and semi - leptonic open charm decay ) as well as several model predictions @xcite including the vacuum @xmath48 spectral function , the in - medium @xmath48 broadening and the in - medium @xmath48 dropping mass .",
    "differences as large as a factor of three between the various predictions can not be resolved within the present uncertainties of the data .",
    "phenix has also the potential of measuring the @xmath3 meson through the  and @xmath49 decay channels .",
    "although the s / b ratio in the @xmath50  is somewhat better ( s / b @xmath6 1/60 ) the errors are still too large for a meaningful comparison to the much higher precision of the @xmath51 data @xcite . larger data samples will be of very limited help . a breakthrough in the phenix capabilities to measure low - mass dileptons",
    "is expected with the installation foreseen in 2006 , of the hadron blind detector @xcite presently under construction @xcite .",
    "ceres presented almost final results of the 2000 pb+au run with the upgraded spectrometer with a radial tpc .",
    "the absolutely normalized invariant mass spectrum of electron pairs shows a clear excess with respect to the hadron cocktail of expected sources , at masses m @xmath17 0.2 gev / c@xmath38 ( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "the magnitude of the excess and its dependence are in very good agreement with previous ceres results . with the improved mass resolution a hint of the @xmath52 and @xmath3 meson peaks is seen for the first time in the ceres data .",
    "the results are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : ceres - miskowiec4b ] to calculations performed by rapp @xcite including in - medium modifications of the @xmath48 meson ( dropping mass according to the brown - rho scaling @xcite , broadening of the @xmath48 according to the rapp - wambach model @xcite ) .",
    "the figure also shows a calculation by kaempfer based on a parametrization of the dilepton yield in terms of @xmath53 annihilation inspired by quark - hadron duality @xcite .",
    "whereas the three calculations give very similar results for masses m @xmath47 0.8 gev / c@xmath38 where the precision of the data is insufficient to discriminate between them , it is interesting to note that the pronounced minimum between the @xmath52 and the @xmath3 in the dropping mass scenario , as implemented in the rapp calculations , is not seen in the data .",
    "the highlight on low - mass dileptons belongs without any doubt to na60 . with an excellent mass resolution of 2.2% at the @xmath3 mass and excellent statistics ,",
    "na60 presented high quality results on low - mass dimuons in 158 agev in+in collisions @xcite .",
    "the data show a clear excess of dimuons which increases with centrality and is more pronounced at low pair .",
    "the results confirm , and are consistent ( at least qualitatively ) with , the pioneering ceres results over the last ten years .",
    "na60 also showed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : na60-scomparin8 ] ) the excess mass spectrum , obtained after subtracting from the data the hadronic cocktail without the @xmath48 ( see @xcite for details of the subtraction procedure ) .",
    "the excess exhibits a broad structure , with a width increasing with centrality , centered at the nominal position of the @xmath48 meson mass .",
    "the figure shows also a comparison of the excess with model calculations @xcite including the vacuum @xmath48 ( thick dashed line ) , in - medium @xmath48 broadening ( thick solid line ) according to the rapp - wambach model @xcite and dropping @xmath48 mass ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the comparison clearly favors the in - medium broadening of the @xmath48 meson over the dropping mass scenario as implemented in @xcite .",
    "the conclusions are valid also for other centralities and as function of .",
    "the na60 data certainly pose a new constraint on the theoretical models which will have to simultaneously account for the ceres and na60 results .",
    "but the deeper impact of these results is their possible relevance to the broader context of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "if the system reaches , or is near to , chiral symmetry restoration then the dilepton results could be telling us that the approach to such a state proceeds through broadening and eventually subsequent melting of the resonances rather than by dropping masses or mass degeneracy between chiral partners .",

    "using a novel analysis technique based on low - mass electron pairs with high , phenix presented interesting and intriguing results on direct photons . exploiting the fact that any source of real @xmath54 photons emits also virtual @xmath55 photons with very low - mass ,",
    "the low - mass electron pair yield ( after taking into account the contribution from dalitz decays ) is translated into a direct photon spectrum assuming @xmath56 @xcite . the resulting direct photon spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : akiba4-photon ] .",
    "it is compatible with the spectrum obtained from a conventional analysis of inclusive real photons @xcite but it has smaller error bars giving more significance to the signal and allowing to extend its range down to = 1 gev / c .",
    "these two improvements are crucial in making apparent an excess of direct photons in the  range of 1 to 4 gev / c , over nlo pqcd calculations @xcite , which is then ascribed to emission from the medium .",
    "interpreted as the elusive thermal radiation of the qgp , the excess spectrum implies an initial temperature of 570 mev or an average temperature of 360 mev @xcite , in the plasma .",
    "but is this a unique interpretation ?",
    "are these direct photons of thermal origin ?",
    "more studies , in particular applying the same analysis technique to reference measurements of p+p and d+au , are needed to consolidate the findings .",
    "to summarize the summary , this was a great conference .",
    "i tried to focus here on the highlights among the many new and exciting results that were presented . in the `` focus '' talks , star summarized its results @xcite and phenix synthesized its findings @xcite drawing the emerging picture that characterizes the matter formed at rhic .",
    "a very high density , strongly interacting partonic matter ( made of constituent quarks ) is formed , reaching thermal equilibrium very early in the collision and behaving like a perfect fluid with a very low ( zero ? ) viscosity .",
    "this is not the ideal qgp gas of free quarks and gluons that we have been looking for during almost twenty years .",
    "this discovery is still ahead of us .",
    "the higher energies of the lhc might be needed for that . as emphasized in the introduction",
    ", rhic has accomplished a lot but much is left to do .",
    "we are only starting to examine the detailed properties of the matter formed at rhic using the full panoply of penetrating probes : jets , open and hidden charm , low - mass dileptons and photons .",
    "many questions are still open , e.g. we have not yet seen unambiguous evidence for deconfinement or chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "these questions are high on the rhic agenda and will be addressed in the next few runs . with the rhic upgrades coming online and the lhc glimpsing over the horizon ,",
    "i look forward to sustained progress and more exciting results over many years .",
    "this work was supported by the israel science foundation , the us - israel binational science foundation , the minerva foundation and the leon and nella benoziyo center for high energy physics .",
    "i am grateful to david denterria , zeev fraenkel , peter jacobs , roy lacey and xin - nian wang for useful comments and discussions .",
