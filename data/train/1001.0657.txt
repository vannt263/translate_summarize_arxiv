    "among the 240 extrasolar planets that have been detected so far with a semi  major axis larger than 0.1 astronomical unit ( au ) , about 100 have an eccentricity @xmath0 .",
    "five of them even have @xmath1 .",
    "such large eccentricities , which can not be the result of disc  planet interaction ( papaloizou et al .",
    "2001 ) , are probably produced by planet ",
    "planet interactions , either through scattering or secular perturbation ( see ford & rasio  2008 and references therein ) , that occur after the disc dissipates ( juric & tremaine 2008 , chatterjee et al . 2008 , ford & rasio 2008 ) .    here",
    ", we show that high eccentricities can be pumped _ by the disc _ if the orbit of the planet is inclined with respect to the disc .",
    "the process involved is an extension of the kozai mechanism , in which a planet is perturbed by a distant companion on an inclined orbit ( kozai 1962 ) .",
    "while the kozai effect has always been studied for the case in which the companion is far away from the planet , the process investigated here is shown to be efficient even if the orbit of the planet crosses the disc .",
    "the classical kozai effect has of course been very well studied . here ,",
    "we show that some significant differences occur when the classical scenario is extended to apply to a disc .    in section  [ sec : kozai ]",
    "we review the kozai effect , and show that the same behaviour is expected whether the planet is perturbed by a distant companion or by a ring of material orbiting far away . in section  [ sec : simulations ] , we present the results of numerical simulations of the interaction between a planet on an inclined orbit and a disc .",
    "we show that , provided most of the mass in the disc is beyond the orbit , and the initial inclination is larger than some critical value , the gravitational potential from the disc causes the eccentricity and the inclination of the planet s orbit to oscillate with time . this may occur even if the orbit crosses the disc .",
    "in section  [ sec : discussion ] we summarise our findings , and discuss under which conditions this mechanism could operate .",
    "the important result is that a planet on an inclined orbit with respect to the disc and located in or within the planet formation region may have its eccentricity pumped up to high values by the interaction with the disc .",
    "this is of astronomical interest , since inclinations are beginning to be measured for extrasolar planets .",
    "we consider a planet of mass @xmath2 orbiting around a star of mass @xmath3 which is itself surrounded by a ring of material of mass @xmath4 .",
    "the ring is in the equatorial plane of the star whereas the orbit of the planet is inclined with respect to this plane .",
    "the motion of the planet is dominated by the star , so that its orbit is an ellipse slightly perturbed by the gravitational potential of the ring .",
    "we study the secular perturbation of the orbit due to the ring .",
    "we denote by @xmath5 the cartesian coordinate system centred on the star and @xmath6 the associated spherical coordinates .",
    "the ring is in the @xmath7plane between the radii @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we suppose that the angular momentum of the disc is large compared to that of the planet s orbit so that the effect of the planet on the disc is negligible : the disc does not precess and its orientation is invariable . the gravitational potential exerted by the ring at the location of the planet is :    @xmath10    where the subscript @xmath11 refers to the planet and @xmath12 is the mass density in the ring .",
    "we assume :    @xmath13    where :    @xmath14    with @xmath15 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath16 , so that the square root in equation  ( [ phi ] ) can be expanded in @xmath17 and integrated to give :    @xmath18.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the classical kozai effect , the planet is perturbed by a distant companion of mass @xmath19 .",
    "if we assume the orbit of this outer companion is circular of radius @xmath20 and lies in the @xmath7plane , then the potential averaged over time it exerts at the location @xmath21 is :    @xmath22 .\\ ] ]    because @xmath23 and @xmath24 appears in exactly the same way in @xmath25 and @xmath26 , the secular perturbation on the inner planet , obtained by averaging over the mean anomaly of its orbit , is the same in both cases to within an overall multiplicative factor .",
    "the results obtained for the classical kozai effect can therefore be extended to the case of the disc .",
    "in particular , the perturbation due to the disc makes the eccentricity @xmath27 of the planet to oscillate with time if the initial inclination angle @xmath28 between the orbit of the planet and the plane of the disc is larger than a critical angle @xmath29 given by :    @xmath30    the maximum value reached by the eccentricity is then ( innanen et al .",
    "1997 ) :    @xmath31    and the time @xmath32 it takes to reach @xmath33 starting from @xmath34 is ( innanen et al .",
    "1997 ) :    @xmath35    with the time @xmath36 defined as :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the orbital period of the planet and @xmath39 is its semi  major axis .",
    "note that the function @xmath40 decreases very sharply from infinity to @xmath41 as @xmath28 increases from @xmath29 to about 45@xmath42 and then decreases by about 50% as @xmath28 continues to increase up to 90@xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43component of the angular momentum of the orbit , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the inclination angle between the orbit and the plane of the disc , is constant .",
    "therefore @xmath45 also oscillates with time and is out of phase with @xmath27 .",
    "we consider a star of mass @xmath46  m@xmath47 surrounded by a disc of mass @xmath4 and a planet of mass @xmath2 whose orbit is inclined with respect to the disc .",
    "the planet interacts gravitationally with the star and the disc but we take @xmath48 so that it has no effect on the disc . to study the evolution of the system , we use the @xmath49body code described in papaloizou  & terquem  ( 2001 ) in which we have added the gravitational force exerted by the disc onto the planet .",
    "the equation of motion for the planet is : @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the position vector of the planet and @xmath25 is the gravitational potential of the disc given by equation  ( [ phi ] ) with @xmath8 and @xmath52 being the inner and outer radii of the disc .",
    "the third term on the right  hand side is the acceleration of the coordinate system based on the central star .",
    "tides raised by the star in the planet and relativistic effects are included through @xmath53 , but they are unimportant here as the planet does not approach the star closely . equation  ( [ emot ] ) is integrated using the bulirsch ",
    "stoer method and the integrals involved in @xmath54 are calculated with the romberg method ( press et al .",
    "1993 ) . in most runs",
    ", the integration conserves the total energy of the planet and @xmath55 within 1 to 2% .",
    "the planet is set on a circular orbit at the distance @xmath23 from the star .",
    "the initial inclination angle of the orbit with respect to the disc is @xmath28 . in the simulations reported here we have taken @xmath56 in equation  ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the functional form of @xmath57 is shallower than what is usually used for discs , but that has no significant effect on the argument we develop here .",
    "we first compare the numerical results with the analysis summarised in section  [ sec : kozai ] by setting up a case with @xmath16 . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we display the evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath45 for @xmath58  m@xmath47 , @xmath59  au , @xmath60  m@xmath47 , @xmath61  au , @xmath62  au and @xmath63 . for this run , @xmath55 is conserved within 2% but the energy of the planet is conserved only within 10% .",
    "we are here in the conditions of the analysis of section  [ sec : kozai ] with @xmath64 . from equation  ( [ emax ] )",
    ", we expect @xmath65 , which is a bit smaller than the value of 0.41 found in the simulation",
    ". also the minimum value of @xmath45 should be @xmath66 and is observed to be @xmath67 .",
    "note that since the energy varies by about 10% in this run , we do not expect exact agreement between the numerical and the analytical results .",
    "we observe that the time it takes to reach @xmath33 from the initial conditions is @xmath68  years , which agrees well with @xmath69 given by equation  ( [ tevol ] ) provided we take @xmath70 .",
    "as mentioned above , @xmath32 becomes very long when @xmath28 is smaller than 45@xmath42 .",
    "as the disc lifetime is only a few myr , @xmath27 would not have time to reach the maximum value in this case , if starting from a very small value .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath45 for @xmath58  m@xmath47 , @xmath71  au , @xmath72  m@xmath47 , @xmath61  au , @xmath73  au and @xmath74 ( case  a ) .",
    "we see that @xmath27 oscillates between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , whereas @xmath45 oscillates between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the values of @xmath79 , @xmath33 and @xmath80 differ from those calculated in the analysis in section  [ sec : kozai ] , but this is expected as the condition @xmath81 , that was used in the analysis , is not valid here .",
    "however , since most of the mass in the disc is in the outer parts , beyond the planet s orbit , the behaviour we get here is similar to that described in the analysis .",
    "the period of the oscillations is @xmath82  years .    for comparison",
    ", we have run the classical kozai case , where the disc is replaced by a planet located on a circular orbit in the @xmath7plane .",
    "this perturbing planet is at a distance @xmath83 from the central star and has a mass @xmath19 .",
    "we take @xmath19 to be the same as the value of @xmath84 above , and consider @xmath85 and 100  au .",
    "the evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath45 for the inner planet in that case is shown in figure  [ fig3bis ] .",
    "equation  ( [ emax ] ) gives @xmath86 , which is in very good agreement with the values of 0.5 and 0.55 obtained from the numerical simulations for @xmath87 and 50  au , respectively .",
    "the time it takes to reach @xmath33 from @xmath88 , which is @xmath89 , is given by equation  ( [ tevol ] ) with @xmath34 being replaced by @xmath88 and @xmath90 t / ( 2 \\pi)$ ] .",
    "we get @xmath91 and @xmath92  years for @xmath87  au ( @xmath93 ) and 50  au ( @xmath94 ) , respectively , which is in excellent agreement with the values seen on figure  [ fig3bis ] .",
    "the minimum angle reached when @xmath85  au is about @xmath95 , much larger than the value obtained when the disc is present . of course this value would decrease if the perturbing planet were moved closer to the inner planet , but then the oscillations would not be regular anymore , as can already be seen in the case @xmath85  au .    figure  [ fig4 ] shows the evolution of @xmath27 and @xmath45 for the same values of @xmath4 and @xmath28 as in case  a but with @xmath96  m@xmath47 , @xmath59  au , @xmath97  au and @xmath98  au ( case  b ) .",
    "here we have @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath78 and @xmath102  years , comparable to the value found in the previous case .    on dimensional grounds , @xmath103 is expected to be proportional to @xmath36 given by equation  ( [ tau ] ) .",
    "we have run case  a with different values of @xmath4 and have checked that @xmath104 .",
    "the values between which @xmath27 and @xmath45 oscillate though do not depend on @xmath4 , as expected from the analysis .",
    "we have run case  a with different values of @xmath23 ranging from 2 to 50  au .",
    "we observe that for @xmath23 roughly below 10  au , @xmath103 decreases when @xmath23 increases , as expected from the expression of @xmath36 . for larger values of @xmath23",
    "though , @xmath103 does not vary much with @xmath23 , and is @xmath105@xmath106  years . for @xmath107 and 20",
    "au , the extreme values of @xmath27 and @xmath45 are roughly the same if the calculations are started from the same @xmath28 and @xmath34 , but for @xmath108  au the amplitude of the oscillations is very small . in that case , most of the disc mass if not beyond the planet s orbit , so that the kozai effect disappears .",
    "finally , we have checked the effect of varying @xmath28 in case  a. we have found that there is a critical value of @xmath28 , @xmath109 , below which eccentricity growth was not observed .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath77 in case  a suggests that @xmath29 may actually be smaller .",
    "since the time it takes for @xmath27 to grow from very small values when @xmath28 is close to @xmath29 is very long ( see equation  [ [ tevol ] ] ) , the simulations may not have been run long enough for a growth to be observed .",
    "as @xmath28 increases from @xmath29 to 90@xmath42 , @xmath33 grows from 0 to 1 .",
    "@xmath103 is not observed to vary significantly with @xmath28 , although the time it takes for the eccentricity to grow from its initial value to @xmath33 does depend on @xmath28 .",
    "the simulations reported here suggest that when the planet s orbit crosses the disc , eccentricity growth occurs for significantly smaller initial inclination angles than in the classical kozai effect .",
    "we have shown that , when a planet s orbit is inclined with respect to a disc , the gravitational perturbation due to the disc results in the eccentricity and the inclination of the orbit oscillating if : ( i ) most of the disc mass is beyond the planet s orbit , ( ii ) the initial inclination angle @xmath28 is larger than some critical value @xmath29 , which may be significantly smaller than in the classical kozai effect . in the simulations we have performed , in which @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( so that the effect of the planet on the disc is negligible ) , oscillations occur as long as the initial planet s distance to the star , @xmath23 , is smaller than about half the disc radius @xmath52 .",
    "we expect a smaller critical distance when @xmath57 decreases more rapidly with radius",
    ". note that @xmath29 should be independent of the functional form of @xmath57 as long as most of the disc mass is beyond the planet s orbit .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations depends only on @xmath28 .",
    "it is small for @xmath112 and becomes large when @xmath28 is increased . in particular , @xmath113 as @xmath114 .",
    "the oscillations of @xmath27 and @xmath45 are @xmath115 out of phase .",
    "their period @xmath116 .",
    "when @xmath117 , @xmath103 decreases as @xmath23 increases . for larger values of @xmath23 , @xmath103 does not vary much with this parameter . in the simulations",
    "we have performed , @xmath118 years . as this is much shorter than the disc lifetime ,",
    "there is a nonzero probability that the planet is left on a highly eccentric orbit as the disc dissipates .",
    "note that the process discussed in this paper is not a mere trivial extension of the kozai effect .",
    "indeed , in the classical kozai effect , the periodic behaviour of @xmath27 is obtained because the dependence of the perturbing gravitational potential on the planet s argument of pericentre @xmath119 is through a term proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "when the orbit of the planet crosses the disc , the gravitational potential has a very different form , and the behaviour of @xmath27 is much more difficult to predict .    the effect discussed here could be inhibited if other processes induced a precession of the planet s orbit on timescales shorter than @xmath121 . that may happen",
    "if other planets are present in the system , or because of dissipative tidal torques exerted by the disc , which have been ignored here ( lubow & ogilvie 2001 ) . in the latter case , the kozai effect would then work only for planets orbiting inside the disc inner cavity .",
    "when the planet crosses the disc , loss of energy and angular momentum circularises the orbit and aligns it with the disc plane on a timescale @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the planet radius ( syer et al .",
    "1991 , ivanov et al .",
    "1999 ) , which can be smaller than @xmath121 for @xmath23 larger than a few  au .",
    "taking this process into account together with the kozai effect may lead to equilibrium values of @xmath27 and @xmath45 .",
    "this will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "note that the usual type  ii migration mechanism that applies to planets orbiting in discs would not be relevant here , as it happens when the planet orbits in a gap that is locked in the disc evolution . in the coplanar case , as the disc spirals toward the central star , it carries along the gap and the planet . when the planet is on an inclined orbit , it may still open up a gap but it is not locked in it , so that it is not being pushed in as the disc spirals in .",
    "the mechanism described here relies on the planet being on an inclined orbit , which could happen as a result of : ( i ) dynamical relaxation of a population of planets formed through fragmentation of a protostellar envelope around a star surrounded by a disc ( papaloizou & terquem  2001 ) ; ( ii ) mean motion resonances ( thommes & lissauer 2003 , also yu & tremaine 2001 ) and ( iii ) gravitational interactions between embryos during the planet formation stage ( levison et al .",
    "1998 , cresswell & nelson 2008 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the process that makes the orbits inclined also makes them eccentric . according to the results presented here",
    ", the disc could pump the eccentricities up to even larger values .",
    "measures of the projected angle between the axes of the planet s orbit and the stellar rotation , using the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect , are becoming available .",
    "so far , only the system xo3 , which has a @xmath124 jupiter masses planet on a 3.19 days orbit with @xmath125 , has been shown to have a spin  orbit misalignment of at least 37@xmath42.3 ( hbrard",
    "2008 , winn et al .",
    "misalignment has also been reported for the system hd  80606 , which has a @xmath126 jupiter mass planet on a 111.44 days orbit with @xmath127 ( moutou et al .",
    "2009 , pont et al .",
    "as hd80606 is a component of a binary system , the classical kozai effect could be responsible for the misalignment in this system .",
