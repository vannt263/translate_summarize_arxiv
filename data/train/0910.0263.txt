    "the miniboone experiment has performed a search for @xmath2 oscillations at large @xmath3 @xcite , an oscillation signature that had been observed by the lsnd experiment , with 3.8@xmath4 significance @xcite .",
    "this oscillation interpretation relies on the existence of a fourth , sterile neutrino mass eigenstate , with @xmath5 0.1 - 100 ev@xmath6 .",
    "mixing via this fourth mass eigenstate can lead to a small probability amplitude for @xmath2 and @xmath7 oscillations at @xmath8/e[mev]\\sim$ ] 1 .",
    "miniboone has previously searched for this type of oscillation using a neutrino beam @xcite , and , under the assumption of cpt conservation , has excluded the lsnd interpretation 98% confidence level ( cl ) @xcite . at the same time , the search revealed an excess of @xmath9 events at low energy @xcite , which is inconsistent with the lsnd excess under the a single sterile neutrino oscillation hypothesis ; however , extensions of this model @xcite offer the possibility of reconsiling the miniboone neutrino results with the lsnd antineutrino result .",
    "these models involve large cp violation which leads to different probabilities for @xmath7 as opposed to @xmath2 oscillations . other models @xcite have also been suggested as explanations , some of which offer predictions for antineutrino running at miniboone . in order to provide another handle on the low - energy excess ,",
    "miniboone was approved in 2007 for extended antineutrino running @xcite , which also enabled miniboone to perform a direct test of the lsnd oscillation interpretation , using antineutrinos .",
    "the miniboone experiment uses 8 gev protons incident on a beryllium target in order to produce mesons which subsequently decay to generate the neutrino beam .",
    "a magnetic field is used at the target to focus positively charged mesons in the forward direction , and defocus negatively charged mesons , to produce a neutrino beam .",
    "reversing the polarity of the magnetic field allows miniboone to switch from a neutrino to an antineutrino beam . the flux @xcite consists primarily of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the low @xmath9 and @xmath12 content of the beam minimizes the background to the oscillation search , ensuring sensitivity to small - amplitude ( of order 10@xmath13 ) oscillations .",
    "the @xmath10 flux has a mean energy of @xmath14600 mev .",
    "the miniboone detector @xcite is located at l=541 m from the proton target .",
    "this establishes an @xmath15 similar to lsnd , and therefore sensitivity to @xmath5 1 ev@xmath6 .",
    "the detector is a spherical tank , 12 meters in diameter , filled with mineral oil and lined with photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "the particle detection and identification method relies on the detection of cherenkov and scintillation light emitted by outgoing charged particles which are produced in neutrino interactions .",
    "the antineutrino oscillation analysis @xcite employs the same analysis chain that was implemented in neutrino mode @xcite .",
    "the analysis relies on differentiation between a majority of @xmath10 charged - current quasi - elastic ( ccqe ) events , and @xmath12 ccqe events , which are the signal .",
    "a track - based event reconstruction is implemented , which uses pmt hit topology and timing to identify electron - like or muon - like cherenkov rings from the corresponding ccqe interactions .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath10 ccqe spectra are fitted simultaneously as a function of reconstructed antineutrino energy , @xmath16 , and the oscillation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath17 are extracted .",
    "the @xmath10 ccqe prediction is used in the fit in order to provide a constraint to the @xmath18 ccqe prediction , as both spectra are correlated through flux and cross section systematics .    the @xmath12 ccqe background prediction , for 3.39@xmath010@xmath1 pot ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nue ] .",
    "the background is dominated at low energy by mis - identified @xmath10 events , such as neutral - current ( nc ) @xmath19 interactions .",
    "that is because miniboone can not differentiate between a single photon or a single electron produced in the detector . at high energy ,",
    "the dominant background is ccqe interactions of intrinsic @xmath12 from the beam , produced in @xmath20 and @xmath21 decays .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath2 oscillations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim ] . the miniboone sensitivity provides substantial coverage of the lower @xmath3 region allowed at 90% cl by a joint analysis of lsnd and karmen @xcite data @xcite .     the antineutrino sensitivity and limit to lsnd - allowed @xmath2 oscillations , from fits to 200 @xmath22 3000 mev .",
    "the miniboone antineutrino dataset corresponds to 3.39@xmath010@xmath1 pot .",
    "also shown is the limit from karmen @xcite.,width=264 ]",
    "the reconstructed energy spectrum of @xmath12 ccqe data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nue ] , overlaid on the predicted @xmath12 ccqe background . at energies above 475 mev",
    ", the data agree with the background prediction within systematic and statistical uncertainties .",
    "the 475 - 675 mev energy region shows a 2.8@xmath4 data fluctuation above background prediction .",
    "this fluctuation forces the miniboone limit , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim ] , to be significantly worse than the sensitivity at lower @xmath3 .",
    "the miniboone best oscillation fit corresponds to ( @xmath23 4.4 ev@xmath6 , @xmath24 0.004 ) .",
    "interestingly , the low - energy region ( 200 - 475 mev ) shows no evidence of an excess . in this range , miniboone observes 61 events , compared to a background expectation of 61.5@xmath2511.7 ( sys+stat ) events .",
    "table [ tab : excess ] shows the probability ( from a two - parameter fit to the data ) that each of the following hypotheses explains the observed number of low - energy neutrino and antineutrino events : 1 ) same @xmath4 : same nc cross section for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",

    "the same @xmath4 , pot scaled , and kaon scaled hypotheses are disfavored as explanations of the miniboone low - energy excess .",
    "the most preferred model is that where the low - energy excess is contributed from only neutrinos in the beam .",
