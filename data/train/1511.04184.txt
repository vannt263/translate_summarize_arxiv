    "measurements of the luminosity function of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) provide the key observational data available to track the history and distribution of accretion onto supermassive black holes .",
    "x - ray surveys have been crucial for performing such measurements as they can efficiently identify agns down to low luminosities , over a wide range of redshifts , and where the central regions are obscured by large amounts of gas and dust ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "a number of studies have presented measurements of the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) of agns based on surveys with the _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these studies show that the agn population has evolved substantially over cosmic time .",
    "both the space density of agns and the overall accretion density ( which traces the total rate of black hole growth ) peaked at @xmath4 and have declined ever since .",
    "the evolution also has a strong luminosity dependence , whereby the space density of luminous agns peaks at @xmath5 whereas lower luminosity agns peak at later cosmic times ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this pattern , reflected in the evolution of the shape of the xlf , provides crucial insights into the underlying distributions of black hole masses and accretion rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a major issue in xlf studies with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ is the impact of absorption .",
    "it is now well established that many agns are surrounded by gas and dust that obscures their emission at certain wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "soft x - rays ( @xmath7  0.52 kev ) will be absorbed by gas with equivalent neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath8 @xmath2 , whereas higher energy x - rays can penetrate larger column densities .",
    "thus , samples selected at @xmath7  210 kev energies are less biased and are typically adopted in xlf studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". however , absorption can still suppress the observable flux , especially at higher column densities ( @xmath9 @xmath2 ) and at lower redshifts ( @xmath10 ) , where the observed band probes lower rest - frame energies .",
    "the emission from compton - thick sources ( @xmath11 @xmath2 ) is even more strongly suppressed , although such sources may still be identified at @xmath7  0.510 kev energies by their scattered emission and signatures of reflection from the obscuring material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "multiwavelength studies can also identify the signatures of heavy obscuration in x - ray detected agns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we also apply priors based on the xlf and @xmath12  functions of a15 ( blue dashed lines , see section 5.1 and table 9 of a15 for the model specification and parameter values , respectively ) and u14 ( red dotted lines , see tables 2 and 4 of u14 ) these studies give the xlf in terms of the intrinsic ( i.e. absorption - corrected ) rest - frame 210 kev luminosity , which we convert to @xmath70  using our x - ray spectral model ( marginalizing over the priors on the spectral parameters ) . with priors based on either the u14 or a15 models , the long tail in @xmath81 is significantly suppressed as high luminosity sources are substantially rarer ( according to the xlf ) .",
    "in addition , the peak of @xmath81 is shifted to slightly lower @xmath70  than with a constant prior .",

    "our extensive simulations have shown that this effect is significant in our _ nustar _ survey data ( see c15 ) .    the distribution of @xmath82 ( right panel of figure  [ fig : lx_vs_nh ] ) is mainly determined by the shape of the @xmath12  function at @xmath76 @xmath2 .",

    "luminosity sources are rarer , the marginalized @xmath82 decreases as @xmath12  increases , indicating that a detected source is less likely to be associated with these higher levels of absorption .",
    "an individual detection is very unlikely to be a compton - thick agn and the chance of extreme column densities ( @xmath90 @xmath2 ) is even more strongly suppressed .",
    "nonetheless , the probability of an individual source having a compton - thick @xmath12  is slightly higher for the u14 prior ( which has a higher intrinsic compton - thick fraction , as the ratio of the number of sources with @xmath91  @xmath2  to all absorbed ( @xmath92  @xmath2 ) agns .",
