    "with the recent experiments on bose - einstein condensation @xcite an atom laser , that is a device which produces an intense coherent beam of atoms by a stimulated process @xcite , has become feasible . already , the mit group has realized a pulsed atom laser @xcite and has provided evidence for the process of coherent matter - wave amplification in the formation of a bose condensate @xcite .    how to describe the matter field of an atom laser ?",
    "rate equations are simple .",
    "but they can not answer this question since they do not contain any coherence .",
    "in contrast a microscopic and fully quantum mechanical treatment can answer the question but is not easy to handle .",
    "what we need is a theory that includes coherence but is still simple . in the present paper",
    "we develop such a theory  a generic model of the atom laser .",
    "the optical laser has three essential ingredients : ( i ) a resonator for the electromagnetic field , ( ii ) an atomic medium , and ( iii ) an excitation mechanism for the atoms .",
    "we start the laser cycle by preparing the atoms in an excited state using this excitation mechanism , which in general is incoherent .",
    "the radiation emitted by the atom amplifies the electromagnetic field in a mode of the resonator . to be efficient the frequency of the mode has to match appropriately the frequency of the transition .",
    "the boundary conditions set by the resonator determine via the helmholtz equation the spatial part of the mode function .",
    "the ultimate goal is to transfer the excitation of the atom into a macroscopic excitation of the field mode . in this way we transfer the energy used to excite the atom via the gain medium into coherent excitation of the field mode . in order to make use of the radiation we have to couple it out of the resonator .",
    "we compensate for this loss by continuously re - pumping the medium .",
    "the goal of an atom laser is completely analogous : we want to create a macroscopic coherent excitation of a mode in a resonator for atoms .",
    "hence , in an atom laser the atoms play the role of the field excitation of the optical laser . since atoms can not be created or annihilated the means to achieve lasing are different . indeed , in an atom laser there is no `` real '' laser medium : it is the same atom that goes through the laser process .",
    "we only manipulate the internal degrees of freedom and center - of - mass motion of the atoms .",
    "in particular we want to force their center - of - mass motion into a specific quantum state of the resonator .",
    "the resonator for the atoms is a binding potential such as provided by a trap .",
    "the spatial part of the mode function of this atomic resonator follows from the time independent schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "moreover , we focus on the ground state of the trap . as in the optical laser",
    "we want a macroscopic excitation of this mode , that is we strive to have as many atoms as possible in one quantum state .",
    "this is the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation . as in the optical laser",
    "we need to couple the atomic wave out of the atomic resonator . in order to have a continuous wave ( cw ) atom laser",
    ", we have to continuously feed in more atoms .",
    "there exist two different approaches towards a theoretical description of a cw atom laser : the first one relies on rate equations @xcite whereas the second one derives a quantum mechanical master equation . in the present paper",
    "we suggest a third approach which makes heavily use of the close analogy between an atom laser and an optical laser . in the latter case it turned out that a classical treatment of the electromagnetic field @xcite was sufficient to describe many features of the laser .",
    "can we therefore devise a semi - classical theory of the atom laser ?    the semi - classical laser theory replaces the electromagnetic field operator @xmath0 for the field inside the laser cavity by the expectation value @xmath1 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath2 is the wave equation of maxwell s electrodynamics driven by the polarization of the laser medium .",
    "an additional term introduced phenomenologically takes into account the loss of the cavity .",
    "the polarization of the laser medium follows from a microscopic , quantum mechanical description of the internal structure of the atoms .",
    "quantum mechanics rules the atoms whereas classical maxwell s wave theory determines the electromagnetic field .",
    "these are the essential ideas of semi - classical laser theory .",
    "the semi - classical laser equations do not prefer any particular phase .",
    "nevertheless by choosing an arbitrary phase we can describe many properties of the electromagnetic field .",
    "furthermore , we have to start with a non - vanishing seed field in order to obtain a non - vanishing solution for the electromagnetic field with a fixed phase .    in our model of an atom laser",
    "we replace the matter - wave field represented by a field operator @xmath3 by a scalar mean field @xmath4 .",
    "this is analogous to replacing the field operator @xmath5 by its expectation value @xmath2 in semi - classical laser theory .",
    "the well - known gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite plays now the role of maxwell s wave equation .",
    "it defines the equation of motion for @xmath6 .",
    "similar to the semi - classical theory of the optical laser we have to break the symmetry of the equation of motion for @xmath7 in order to have a non - vanishing value for @xmath7 . for massive particles",
    "this is more problematic than for photons since they can not be created or annihilated , and for all quantum states with fixed particle number we have @xmath8 .",
    "nevertheless the concept of spontaneously broken symmetry turned out to be very useful to describe properties of a condensate , in particular interference effects . for more detailed discussions",
    "see refs .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the driven electromagnetic wave equation the gross - pitaevskii equation does not contain a gain term analogous to the polarization .",
    "this reflects the fact that in bose - einstein condensation there is no `` medium '' in the trap .",
    "we therefore add a phenomenological pump term .",
    "moreover , as in the electromagnetic case we have to add a loss term .",
    "despite the similarity there is a fundamental difference in the two equations of motion . in the absence of a medium maxwell s wave equation",
    "is linear .",
    "in contrast the gross - pitaevskii equation is non - linear .",
    "this is a manifestation of the interaction of atoms .",
    "the crucial part of any laser is the stimulated amplification process .",
    "different mechanisms for matter - wave amplification have been suggested and discussed : optical cooling @xcite , elastic collisions by evaporative cooling @xcite , dissociation of molecules @xcite , and cooling by a thermal reservoir @xcite . for different schemes of pumping a condensate we refer to refs .",
    "our model does not rely on a specific mechanism , but can be adapted to any mechanism where bose enhancement is present .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we generalize the gross - pitaevskii equation by including gain and loss terms .",
    "one important loss is due to coupling the atom wave out of the resonator .",
    "however , similar to semi - classical laser theory where usually the field inside the laser cavity is investigated , we restrict ourselves to the matter - wave field inside the resonator .",
    "we therefore do not go into details of an output coupler @xcite .",
    "we present the stationary solutions of our equations and perform a stability analysis .",
    "we find a threshold behavior similar to the optical laser .",
    "moreover , we calculate the time dependent solution and show how it converges to a quasi - stationary solution .",
    "in general , the quasi - stationary solution we find does not coincide with the time independent solution but shows some oscillatory behavior around it .",
    "these oscillations disappear when we modify our equations in sec .",
    "[ sec : spaceloss ] by introducing a space dependent loss .",
    "this loss can be thought of as a consequence of collisions between condensed and un - condensed atoms at the edges of the condensate . for this improved model",
    "we present a modified thomas - fermi approximation for the stationary solution .",
    "section [ sec : concludere ] summarizes our results .",
    "in this section we summarize our generic model of an atom laser .      in particular , we add the phenomenological gain and loss terms to the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) . in this way we couple the gpe to an equation governing the number of un - condensed atoms .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the mean field @xmath9 of the condensed atoms of mass @xmath10 in a trap potential @xmath11 reads @xcite @xmath12 the non - linear term @xmath13 with @xmath14 takes into account two - particle interactions where @xmath15 denotes the s - wave scattering length .",
    "the gpe has been very successful in describing the properties of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "however , in the present form it can not describe the growth of or the loss of atoms out of a condensate .",
    "indeed , the gpe keeps the number of atoms @xmath16 constant .    in order to overcome this problem",
    "we introduce two additional terms in the gpe : a loss term and a gain term .",
    "the loss term @xmath17 leads to an exponential decay of the number of atoms in the condensate .",
    "in contrast the gain term @xmath18 leads to an increase of atoms in the condensate . here",
    "@xmath19 is the number of atoms outside the condensate , that is , the un - condensed atoms , and @xmath20 is the rate for the transition of these atoms into the condensate .",
    "we regard this as a generic pump mechanism @xcite of an atom laser since it contains already the bose enhancement as we will see later .",
    "when we add the loss term ( [ lossterm ] ) and the gain term ( [ gainterm ] ) to the gpe ( [ gpeq ] ) , we arrive at the generalized gpe @xmath21 for the number of un - condensed atoms @xmath19 we assume the rate equation @xmath22 the first term reflects the fact that we generate with a rate @xmath23 atoms in an un - condensed state from an infinite reservoir of atoms .",
    "the term @xmath24 takes into account that atoms can escape from our system without being trapped in the condensed state .",
    "the last term describes the transition of the atoms into the condensate .",
    "since it is proportional to the number of atoms @xmath25 in the condensate , it contains the bose - enhancement factor .    in this way we have coupled the generalized gpe governing the condensate to the rate equation governing the number of un - condensed atoms .",
    "these two equations ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ ne ] ) are the foundations of our model .",
    "the number @xmath25 of condensed atoms follows from the generalized gpe ( [ psi ] ) with the help of the definition , eq .",
    "( [ defng ] ) . from eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) we obtain the rate equation @xmath26 for the number of atoms in the condensate .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that rate equations similar to eqs .",
    "( [ ne ] ) and ( [ ng ] ) have already been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , in the present paper we replace the rate equation ( [ ng ] ) by the generalized gpe ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "this equation obviously contains the rate equation but in addition the coherence .",
    "before we turn to the stationary solution of the generalized gpe , eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) , we first discuss the stationary solutions of the rate equations ( [ ne ] ) and ( [ ng ] ) .",
    "the rate equations ( [ ne ] ) and ( [ ng ] ) have two possible stationary solutions :    the solution @xmath27 is reminiscent of the optical laser below threshold where the intensity of the laser vanishes .",
    "the other stationary solution @xmath28 corresponds to the laser above threshold .",
    "we now perform a stability analysis of these solutions . for this purpose",
    "we introduce small deviations @xmath29 and arrive at the linearized equations @xmath30 a stability analysis of these equations shows that the stationary solution in eqs .",
    "( [ ratestatsol1 ] ) is stable for @xmath31 likewise , our stability analysis shows that eqs .",
    "( [ ratestatsol2 ] ) are a stable stationary solution for @xmath32 therefore , there exists a threshold @xmath33 .",
    "when the pump rate @xmath23 is below the threshold , the number @xmath25 of atoms in the condensate vanishes . when it is above , it is non - vanishing . in that case",
    "the steady - state number of atoms in the condensate grows linearly with the pump rate @xmath23 .",
    "we now turn to the discussion of the stationary solutions of our generic model of the atom laser , that is of the generalized gpe coupled to the rate equation for @xmath19 .    the stable stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) corresponding to a vanishing number of atoms in the condensate is @xmath34 this is the stationary solution of the mean field below threshold .    above threshold the stationary solution @xmath35 of the generalized gpe ( [ psi ] )",
    "is identical to the stationary solution of the conventional gpe . indeed , when we substitute the ansatz @xmath36 into eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and note that the gain and loss terms cancel each other as a result of the stationary solution , eq .",
    "( [ ratestatsol2 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath37 here , @xmath38 denotes the chemical potential .",
    "a stability analysis of this equation leads to collective excitations @xcite which in general can not be treated analytically .",
    "for such an analysis in the case of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator we refer to the appendix .      in the preceding section",
    "we have discussed the steady - state solutions of both the rate equations ( [ ne ] ) and ( [ ng ] ) and the matter - field equations ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ ne ] ) of the atom laser . in the present section",
    "we address the question if and how the matter field evolves into a stationary state from an initial condition . here",
    "we focus on the case above threshold .",
    "since the equations are non - linear we solve them numerically for the case of an one - dimensional harmonic oscillator potential @xmath39 this one - dimensional trap potential already shows the essential features of the atom laser .",

    "we use the split - operator method @xcite to solve the generalized gpe .",

    "@xcite to one dimension . for the details of the analytical approach",
    "we refer to the appendix .",
    "the semi - classical theory of the optical laser can not explain the initial start - up of the laser since it does not contain spontaneous emission : a non - vanishing seed electromagnetic field starts the laser .",
    "similarly , in our model of the atom laser we start from an initial condition for the mean matter field @xmath42 that is non - zero .",
    "this is the seed field for our atom laser .",
    "let us illustrate this by considering for the moment the `` natural '' initial condition @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this implies @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore start without any atoms in the system .",
    "moreover , we consider a pump rate @xmath23 above threshold .",
    "this choice of initial conditions leads to the unstable solution @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "@xcite , where one usually has a high - q cavity , we require @xmath53 . since in the steady state we do not want to have too many atoms in the non - condensate part , we require @xmath54 , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ ratestatsol2 ] ) . in order to have a reasonably small threshold value we choose @xmath55 appropriately , as indicated by eq .",

    "the collective excitations discussed in the preceding section depend on the initial condition @xmath42 .",
    "this is due to the fact that so far there is no mode selection mechanism in our model which would favor one stationary solution of the gpe over the others .",
    "this fact is similar to the optical multi - mode laser @xcite .",
    "we can accomplish a single - mode atom laser when we allow for a space dependent loss .",
    "this is the topic of the present section where we formulate an improved model for an atom laser .",
    "real losses in a trapped condensate are spatially dependent : for example , a possible loss mechanism are collisions with un - condensed atoms which are preferably located at the edge of the condensate , see refs .",
    "further , atoms can be lost at the edge of the condensate because of a finite trapping potential . moreover",
    ", the goal of a matter - wave output - coupler is to create a directed coherent atomic beam .",
    "all of these reasons require a spatially dependent loss term .",
    "in contrast to this loss term we keep the pump term spatially independent .",

    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "we see that for the parameters of the left column both tf approximations for the density work quite well .",
    "the modified tf solution approximates the center better than the usual tf solution .",
    "however , the radius derived from the usual tf approximation is a better estimate of the edge of the condensate than the modified tf radius . for the set of parameters used in the right column of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] both tf approximations for the density do not work that well anymore .",
    "the reason for this break - down is that the condensate reaches too far into the loss region where the density varies strongly and the derivatives neglected in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ modsqr ] ) and ( [ nablasqr_phi ] ) become important .",
    "nevertheless our modified tf solution shows at least qualitatively the same behavior as the fully numerical solution .",
    "surprisingly , at regions towards the peaks of the loss where the loss rate is at its highest , the density is first decreased and then increased in the modified tf over the usual tf solution .",
    "this is understandable from eq .",
    "( [ modsqr ] ) when we consider in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] the current @xmath134 .",

    "the modified tf solution even predicts a velocity changing the direction .",

    "close to threshold , the spatial extent of the two approximate wave functions is becoming smaller with decreasing atom number .",

    "the deviation of the approximate threshold , eq .",

    "we achieve the desired single lasing mode .",
    "we have derived a modified thomas - fermi solution for the steady - state mean field .",
    "this solution takes into account the effects of a pump term and a position dependent loss term .",
    "in contrast to a constant phase of the usual thomas - fermi solution , the modified thomas - fermi solution has a spatially dependent phase , i.e.  velocity , due to the permanent flow of atoms in and out of the condensate .",
    "the modified thomas - fermi solution is a good approximation in regions where the loss shape is slowly varying and for sufficiently large atom numbers .",
    "we emphasize that our model of an atom laser is very simple and rather general .",
