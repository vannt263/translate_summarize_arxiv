    "the phenomenology of high energy diffraction succeeds in correlating many of the features of high energy hadron ",
    "hadron interactions in terms of relatively few parameters .",
    "however since the advent of qcd as the theory of hadronic physics , it has been clear that ultimately there must be an understanding of this phenomenology in terms of qcd . with the advent of the @xmath1 collider hera , for the first time it has become possible to probe the regions of proton structure involved in the diffractive interactions which form the bulk of the proton interaction cross section at high energy .",
    "recently the h1 and zeus collaborations have quantified the diffractive contribution to the proton structure function by measuring the `` diffractive structure function '' @xmath0 ( see @xcite for details of the analyses ) .",
    "these measurements are made as a function of three kinematic variables , @xmath5 , @xmath2 and @xmath6 , or equivalently @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath6 , which are defined as follows : @xmath8 here @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the @xmath12momenta of the virtual boson , the incident proton , and the final state colourless remnant @xmath13 ( proton or low mass excited state ) respectively  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath14 .",
    "a structure function is defined  @xcite in analogy with the decomposition of the unpolarised total @xmath1 cross section : @xmath15}\\right\\ }    \\,f_2^{d(4)}(x , q^2,x_{i\\!\\!p},t )             \\label{eq : deff2d}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the hadronic system excluding the colourless remnant @xmath13 . for these measurements ,",
    "no accurate determination of @xmath17 was possible , and the measured structure function @xmath0 was evaluated from the differential cross section @xmath18 such that @xmath19 where @xmath20 is set to 0 for all @xmath21 following the original procedure of  @xcite .",
    "an excellent fit to all data points , irrespective of @xmath2 and @xmath7 , is obtained assuming a dependence @xmath22 with a single exponent ( h1 : @xmath23 , @xmath24c.l .",
    ", zeus : @xmath25 ) .",
    "such a universal dependence is expected navely if the diffractive deep  inelastic process involves the interaction of a virtual photon with a ( colourless ) target in the incident proton whose characteristics are not dependent on @xmath6 , and which carries only a small fraction of the proton s momentum .",
    "furthermore , the values for @xmath26 are consistent with that expected if the diffractive mechanism may be encapsulated in the parameterisation that describes ",
    "soft hadronic \" diffractive interactions , namely the pomeron ( @xmath27 ) with @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30  @xcite . the diffractive structure function may therefore be written in the `` factorisable '' form @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and the natural interpretation of @xmath33 is then that of the deep - inelastic structure of the diffractive exchange ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in order to investigate the @xmath2 and @xmath7 dependencies of @xmath0 it is convenient to define an integral of @xmath0 over a fixed range in @xmath6 which , assuming the simple factorisation of ( [ eq : xpfactor ] ) , is proportional to the structure function of the @xmath27 : @xmath34 this procedure avoids the need to specify the theoretically ill - defined normalisation of the diffractive flux , and permits direct comparison of the data with any theoretical model . the h1 data for @xmath35 are shown in figure [ fig : h1fit ] .",
    "( 150,80 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 52,-2 ) ( 5,0)a ) ( 50,0)b ) ( 100,45)c ) ( 100,0)d )    the lack of any substantial dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath7 and the substantial contribution at @xmath36 suggests that the structure resolved by the electron in high @xmath7 diffractive interactions may be partonic in origin  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath2 is then that of the appropriate bjorken scaling variable in deep ",
    "inelastic diffraction .",
    "this hypothesis may be tested by introducing parton densities for the pomeron such that ( in the leading @xmath37 approximation ) @xmath38",
    "\\label{eq : pomparton}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are the density functions for the @xmath26 quark flavours considered .",
    "the evolution of these parton density functions with @xmath7 may then be calculated using the dglap evolution equations , and the range of possible solutions for the parton densities which are compatible with the data investigated by a standard qcd fit procedure .",
    "however , it has been observed that the lack of any fall of @xmath40 with increasing @xmath7 at large @xmath2 contrasts with the violations of scale invariance exhibited by the structure function of a typical hadron  @xcite .",
    "for example , the proton structure function @xmath41 rises with increasing @xmath7 for @xmath42 , and falls with increasing @xmath7 for @xmath43 .",
    "this decrease at high @xmath5 is an inevitable consequence of dglap qcd evolution for an object with a structure built from the evolution of `` valence '' quarks in which the latter predominate at large bjorken@xmath5 . by analogy , a structure function",
    "for which any violation of scale invariance amounts to an increase with @xmath44 at high bjorken@xmath5 ( @xmath2 ) , is likely to have a large gluon , relative to quark , parton density at high @xmath2 .    to quantify any substantive evidence for a gluonic contribution to @xmath40",
    ", h1 performed an analysis in which the dglap evolution equations were solved numerically in the leading ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xmath37 approximations  @xcite .",
    "starting from a scale @xmath45 , the following forms were assumed for the quark flavour singlet exchange is assumed , despite the fact that meson exchange contributions to the measured cross section are possible .",
    "this assumption is supported insofar as the data for @xmath0 may be parameterisd by a single trajectory with intercept close to unity . ]",
    "distribution @xmath46 $ ] and gluon distribution @xmath47 at an initial scale of @xmath45 : @xmath48 @xmath49 no momentum sum rule was imposed .",
    "these parton densities were evolved to higher @xmath7 and compared with the measurements of the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath40 taking into account fully both the statistical and systematic contributions to the uncertainty in the measured data .",
    "the results of two lo fits are shown , superimposed on the data , in figure [ fig : h1fit ] .",
    "though a solution in which only quarks contribute to the pomeron structure at the starting scale ( dashed line ) does not _ qualitatively _ reproduce the rise of @xmath40 with @xmath7 at all values of @xmath2 , this solution provides a statistically acceptable description of the data ( @xmath50 , 37%c.l . ) the addition of a gluon density at @xmath51 results in an excellent description of @xmath35 ( @xmath52 = @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) which reproduces the rise with @xmath44 at higher @xmath2 . in this solution , shown by the solid curve in figure  [ fig : h1fit ] , at @xmath45",
    "the gluons carry @xmath55 of the momentum of diffractive exchange , and the fitted gluon density is very hard , tending to @xmath56 , indicating that the structure of diffraction may involve the leading exchange of a single gluon  ( figure  [ fig : h1fit]c , d ) . repeating the analysis at nlo reduces somewhat the fraction of the momentum carried by gluons .",
    "a nlo analysis allows a prediction for the longitudinal structure function of the pomeron , @xmath57 , to be calculated .",
    "this prediction may then be tested directly against the data since the wide range in @xmath6 accessible at hera results in a large variation in @xmath58 centre of mass energy .",
    "thus for a genuinely factorisable cross section of the form @xmath59 with @xmath60 greater than 0 , the @xmath0 extracted from the data with the assumption that @xmath61 will be modified from the expectation of the factorisable expression ( ) by a multiplicative factor @xmath62 where @xmath63 \\ ,   / \\ , \\left[2(1-y)+y^2\\right]\\ ] ] thus @xmath57 may be extracted directly from the data at fixed @xmath1 centre of mass energy ( in contrast to @xmath64 ) by measuring such apparent deviations from factorisation .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath57 extracted in this way , and the prediction of a qcd analysis would allow the validity of this factorisable approach to be tested at nlo .",
    "at this point we extend the h1 analysis by considering both the h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite data . a leading log combined fit to these two measurements of @xmath65",
    "is performed assuming the factorisable form ( [ eq : xpfactor ] ) with with @xmath66 and permitting the parameterisation of the parton densities at the starting scale @xmath67 and the exponent @xmath26 to vary simultaneously .",
    "table [ tab : fitpar ] summarises the results of this study , which are compared with the data in figure  [ fig : golec ] . in the first fit",
    "all seven parameters are allowed to vary whilst @xmath68 is fixed at @xmath69 .",
    "the second fit illustrates how the results change when @xmath68 is set to @xmath70 .",
    "fits 3 and 4 show how the parameters change if the value of @xmath26 is fixed to an intermediate value , and to the value determined by zeus respectively .",
    "the obtained @xmath52 confirms observation of h1 and zeus that the present data are in a very good agreement with the factorisable form ( [ eq : xpfactor ] ) of @xmath0 .",
    "the fitted parameter @xmath26 is in an excellent agreement with the h1 value ( @xmath71 ) , although fixing it to the zeus value ( @xmath72 ) in the fit does not lead to a significant deterioration of the fit quality .",
    "-1 cm    the form of the fitted quark flavour singlet and gluon density functions are shown as a function of @xmath2 for different values of @xmath7 in figure [ fig : golec ] .",
    "the normalisation of the pomeron flux is somewhat arbitrary : any constant factor may be shifted between the pomeron flux and structure function in ( [ eq : xpfactor ] ) . here",
    "the pomeron flux parameterisation of berger et .",
    "al .  @xcite and streng  @xcite was used to define absolutely the normalisation of parton densities in the pomeron . with this normalisation",
    "the momentum sum @xmath73 is @xmath74 and the contribution to this sum from gluons is @xmath75 at @xmath76 falling to @xmath77 at @xmath78 , in agreement with the h1 analysis .",
    "the form of the gluon density at the starting scale @xmath79 is similar to that obtained in the h1 analysis , confirming the conclusion that the persistence of a rise of @xmath0 with @xmath37 can only be reproduced by a large gluon ( relative to quark ) distribution at large @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is worth repeating that the demand for such a gluon density can not be demonstrated conclusively given the magnitude of the total errors of the measurements .",
    "a plethora of gluon distributions have been shown to yield a reasonable description of the hera data  @xcite and so in the absence of more accurate data the gluon density in the pomeron remains essentially unconstrained .",
    "the analyses discussed here demonstrate that the h1 and zeus data are compatible with a factorisable interpretation  @xcite in which the deep  inelastic diffractive structure is governed by a partonic structure for the pomeron .",
    "whether such an approach provides more than merely a compact parameterisation of the @xmath0 data relies crucially on the universality of these parton densities . theoretically , the collinear factorisation supporting such universality is predicted to break down in diffractive jet production in hadron ",
    "hadron collisions , but the mechanism responsible for this breakdown is not expected in @xmath1 scattering  @xcite .",
    "although , factorisation has not been proven rigorously for any diffractive process  @xcite , at this workshop there was general agreement that there is some justification for the leading @xmath37 approximation for @xmath80 .",
    "experimentally , the goals are clear",
    ". more accurate measurements of @xmath0 over as wide a kinematic range as possible are essential .",
    "the qcd analyses suggest that the region of high @xmath2 is of great theoretical interest , where the potentially large gluon density may give rise to a large @xmath57 .",
    "measurements at very high @xmath81 are sensitive to the longitudinal component of the cross section and will test the validity of dglap evolution beyond the leading @xmath37 approximation .",
    "measurements at @xmath82 will establish whether additional exchanges @xmath83 contribute to the production of large rapidity gaps at hera .",
    "the universality of the parton densities extracted from qcd analyses such as those presented here can be tested directly by exclusive measurements .",
    "the wide range in gluon densities compatible with the hera data provide a wide range of predictions for the production of inclusive charm and high @xmath84 jets , and the possibility that the presence of an additional hard scale ( @xmath85 , high @xmath84 , high @xmath21 ) could change the energy ( @xmath6 ) dependence should be investigated . in conclusion , the simple factorisable model in which universal parton densities are ascribed to the pomeron has fulfilled the most basic requirement of describing the inclusive diffractive cross section , but it has yet to be tested in any substantial way .",
