    "the upper critical field @xmath0 is one of the most fundamental quantities in type - ii superconductors .",
    "after the pioneering work by abrikosov@xcite based on the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations,@xcite theoretical efforts have been made for its quantitative description at all temperatures.@xcite however , we still have a limited success when compared with those for the electronic structures in the normal state.@xcite the purpose of the present paper is to provide a theoretical framework which enables us _ ab initio _ calculations of @xmath0 as accurate as electronic - structure calculations in the normal state .",
    "necessary ingredients to be included are ( i ) nonlocal effects effective at low temperatures ; ( ii ) impurity scattering ; ( iii ) fermi - surface anisotropy ; ( iv ) strong - coupling effects ; ( v ) gap anisotropy ; ( vi ) mixing of higher landau levels in the spatial dependence of the pair potential ; ( vii ) landau - level quantization in the quasiparticle energy;@xcite ( viii ) fluctuations beyond the mean - field theory.@xcite we here derive an @xmath0 equation which is numerically tractable , including all the effects except ( vii ) and ( viii ) .",
    "an @xmath0 equation considering the effects ( i ) and ( ii ) was obtained by helfand and werthamer.@xcite it was extended by hohenberg and werthamer@xcite to take the fermi - surface anisotropy ( iii ) into account .",
    "equations with the strong - coupling effects ( iv ) were derived by eilenberger and ambegaokar@xcite using matsubara frequencies and by werthamer and mcmillan@xcite on the real energy axis , which are equivalent to one another .",
    "schossmann and schachinger@xcite later incorporated pauli paramagnetism into the strong - coupling equation .",
    "although an equation including ( i)-(iv ) was presented by langmann,@xcite it is still rather complicated for carrying out an actual numerical computation . on the other hand , rieck and scharnberg@xcite presented an efficient @xmath0 equation where the effects ( i)-(iii ) and ( vi ) were taken into account , and also ( v ) in the special case of the clean limit .",
    "see also the work by rieck , scharnberg , and schopohl@xcite where the strong - coupling effects ( v ) have also been considered .",
    "our study can be regarded as a direct extension of the rieck - scharnberg equation@xcite to incorporate ( i)-(iv ) simultaneously . to this end",
    ", we adopt a slightly different and ( probably ) more convenient procedure of using creation and annihilation operators",
    ". we will proceed with clarifying the connections with the rieck - scharnberg equation as explicitly as possible .",
    "the remarkable success of the simplified bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory@xcite tells us that detailed electronic structures are rather irrelevant to the properties of classic superconductors at @xmath4 .",
    "however , this is not the case for the properties of type - ii superconductors in finite magnetic fields , especially in the clean limit , as first recognized by hohenberg and werthamer.@xcite their effort to include the fermi - surface anisotropy in the @xmath0 equation was motivated by the fact that the helfand - werthamer theory@xcite using the spherical fermi surface shows neither qualitative nor quantitative agreements with experiments on clean type - ii superconductors like nb@xcite and v.@xcite indeed , angular variation in @xmath0 by @xmath5 was observed at low temperatures in high - quality nb@xcite and v@xcite with cubic symmetry.@xcite also , the reduced critical field @xmath6 calculated by helfand and werthamer@xcite has @xmath7 in the clean limit , whereas a later experiment on high - purity nb shows @xmath8 for the average over field directions.@xcite hohenberg and werthamer@xcite carried out a perturbation expansion for cubic materials with respect to the nonlocal correction where the fermi - surface anisotropy enters .",
    "they could thereby provide a qualitative understanding of the @xmath0 anisotropy and the enhancement of @xmath9 observed in nb .",
    "they also derived an expression for @xmath10 applicable to anisotropic fermi surfaces .",
    "it was later used by mattheiss@xcite to estimate @xmath11 for nb based on his detailed electronic - structure calculation .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath12 in the clean limit on detailed fermi - surface structures can also be seen clearly in the numerical results from a model calculation by rieck and scharnberg,@xcite and from the difference @xmath7 and @xmath13 between spherical and cylindrical fermi surfaces , respectively.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at @xmath14 , @xmath15}(t)$ ] and @xmath16}(t)$ ] near @xmath2 show small upward curvature , whereas @xmath17}(t)$ ] remains almost identical with the curve for the spherical fermi surface .",
    "this difference may be quantified by the ratio @xmath18 defined in eq .",
    "( [ hc2 ] ) .",
    "it was numerically evaluated by using the fermi velocity on the fermi surface and shown in table  [ tab : b2 ] .",
    "the values for the directions [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] are larger than @xmath19 for the spherical fermi surface .",
    "thus , calculated @xmath18 values well describe the difference in @xmath20 for @xmath21 among field directions .",
    "the upward curvature is more and more pronounced as the fermi surface approaches the brillouin zone boundary , as can be seen clearly in fig .  2 for @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding ratio @xmath18 for the [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] directions are about three times larger than those for @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the present calculation clearly indicates that the fermi surface anisotropy can be a main source of the upward curvature in @xmath0 near @xmath3 .     at @xmath24 as a function of the fermi energy @xmath25 .",

    "indeed , @xmath33 for every field direction shows a singularity at @xmath34 where the fermi surface touches the brillouin zone at @xmath35 with vanishing fermi velocity @xmath36 at these points . as a result ,",
    "the contribution around these points becomes important in the integration @xmath37 over the fermi surface at low temperatures .",

    "this may be attributed to the topological difference of the fermi surface . at @xmath41 ,",
    "the tight - binding band is half - filled and the fermi - surface nesting occurs .",
    "however , @xmath33 does not show any singularity around this energy .    finally , we present results on the higher landau - level contributions to the pair potential @xmath42 which is expanded as eq .",
    "( [ dexpand ] ) . in general ,",
    "when the system has @xmath43-fold symmetry around the field direction , mixing of higher landau levels with multiples of @xmath43 develops as the temperature is lowered.@xcite figure [ fig : tb3dvecfig4 ] shows the ratio @xmath44 as a function of @xmath45 for @xmath46 ( solid lines ) and @xmath47 ( dotted lines ) with ( a ) @xmath48 $ ] ( @xmath49 from bottom to top lines ) , ( b ) @xmath50 $ ] ( @xmath51 from bottom to top lines ) , and ( c ) @xmath52 $ ] ( @xmath53 ) .",
