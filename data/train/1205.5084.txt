    "special theory of relativity predicts @xcite that measurements performed by instruments at a resting frame would show the increase of mass , contraction of length , and dilation of time as compared to the similar measurements performed at the frame moving with the velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the relative magnitude of these effects is mostly determined by the quadratic term of the lorenz factor @xmath1 evanescence of these effects in laboratory settings , along with their unclear nature made interpretation of relativity the subject of active discussions , recently spread to _",
    "metrologia_. the paper @xcite claims that the correction for the finite speed of light in absolute gravimeters is the result of relativistic effects . in the reply @xcite to our comment @xcite , where we disagreed with this claim ,",
    "the authors have brought even more relativistic arguments into the reasoning of the correction . following the reply @xcite",
    ", we address two interrelated questions with far - reaching consequences for physics , geophysics , and metrology :    * what correction for the finite speed of light should be used ? * are relativistic effects observable in modern absolute gravimeters ?",
    "the influence of any phenomenon on the absolute gravimeter measurements can be analyzed in two steps @xcite .",
    "first , the disturbance of the test mass tracked trajectory caused by the phenomenon is to be found , then the disturbance has to be translated into the appropriate correction .",
    "the comment @xcite discusses problems we found in @xcite with both steps of the process , while the reply @xcite addresses only our critique of the first step .",
    "the result that the authors are still standing by is the disturbance of the trajectory due to the finite speed of light .",
    "the issue actually boils down to the value of @xmath2 in the expression of the disturbance @xmath3 while our analysis @xcite reveals that the value of @xmath2 should be 3 , the authors of @xcite insist that @xmath2 equals 2 . to investigate the issue , we can simplify ( [ dg_c_with_k ] ) by neglecting test mass initial velocity @xmath4 , and its position with respect to the interferometer that determines the sign of ( [ dg_c_with_k ] ) .",
    "let s follow two physics majors , alice and bob , on their quest to measure gravity acceleration .",
    "by arrangement with a local amusement park , the students decided to use a ride that has free falling platform .",
    "they have marked up the ride with units of length ( fig.[c - followup]a ) [ sec_extra_delay ]    and started the experiment .",
    "bob ( b ) was taking rides , and every time the platform reached next mark , he signaled the event with a flashlight back to alice ( a ) .",
    "as every signal corresponded to a known position of the platform , the students obtained the acceleration by fitting the following model to the data : @xmath5 where @xmath6 was the position of the platform at the moment @xmath7 , as determined by arrival of the flashlight signals .",
    "the students then realized that the moment @xmath7 , at which the signal arrived to the top of the ride was not exactly the same as the moment the signal was send .",
    "the delay of the signal traveling from bob to alice with the speed @xmath8 is @xmath9 , so the students modified the model as @xmath10 because @xmath11 was about the same distance @xmath6 as in ( [ z_fit ] ) , they have substituted ( [ z_fit ] ) for @xmath6 in ( [ z_fit_corr ] ) , and expressed the acceleration like : @xmath12 = g_0 - 3 \\frac{g_0 ^ 2 t}{c } .\\ ] ] then the students conducted another experiment .",
    "they attached a reflector to the platform and used it as moving arm of the michelson - type interferometer ( fig.[c - followup]b . ) every time the platform advanced one - half of the laser wavelength , the whole period of the interference was observed .",
    "but what about the influence of the finite speed of light in this experiment ? at the moment",
    "the platform moves with the velocity @xmath0 , the frequency of the reflected beam is determined by the double doppler shift @xcite : @xmath13 the observed beat frequency is @xmath14 as every period of the beat signal corresponds to the advancement of the test mass on @xmath15 , the velocity @xmath16 deduced from the signal ( [ f_beat ] ) is @xmath17 substituting @xmath18 , the acceleration can be found as @xmath19 = g_0 - 2\\frac{g_0 ^ 2t}{c}.\\ ] ] comparison of ( [ g_beat ] ) and ( [ z_fit_corr ] ) has puzzled the students , because in the second experiment the finite speed of light yielded the disturbance one - third less then that in the first experiment ( [ z_fit_corr ] ) . after pondering for a while ,",
    "the students suspected the source of the problem was with the formula ( [ f_beat ] ) .",
    "`` look , '' said alice , `` the difference signal ( [ f_beat ] ) emerges at the beam splitter , while the doppler shifts ( [ f_reflected ] ) happen at the reflector . ''",
    "`` there is a small , but finite time interval between the moments that same photons touch those two objects , '' added alice . following the clue ,",
    "bob has modified the formula ( [ g_beat ] ) like @xmath20 = g_0 - 3\\frac{g_0 ^ 2t}{c}.\\ ] ] though the disturbance term became now the same as in formula ( [ z_fit_corr ] ) , the students were still in doubt .",
    "`` strange thing , '' said alice , `` the time delay gave us the entire disturbance term when we applied it in the first experiment .",
    "and now the same delay has added only one - third of the disturbance ... '' `` maybe , this has something to do with the fact that the delay was applied differently in the second experiment ? '' suggested bob",
    ". `` right ! '' exclaimed alice .",
    "`` look , the first time the delay was applied to the signal carrying the information about the coordinate , and the second time the delay was applied to the velocity signal . ''",
    "if in the first experiment bob could have send the information about the velocity , not coordinate , the model would become @xmath21 substituting the delay into this model yields the following acceleration @xmath22 = g_0 - \\frac{g_0 ^ 2 t}{c}.\\ ] ] `` amazing ! ''",
    "said bob , `` this disturbance term is indeed exactly one - third of that we obtained in the first experiment . ''",
    "the students then wrote up a brief summary of what they have learned about the influence of the finite speed of tracking signal on the measured acceleration .",
    "here is the note :    _ `` acceleration of the test mass can be obtained from the information of its coordinate or velocity . in either case the tracking signal delivers the information with the same delay .",
    "the acceleration disturbance obtained by applying the delay to the velocity signal is one - third of that obtained by applying the delay to the coordinate .",
    "the remaining two - thirds of the disturbance come from the double doppler shift , so that overall disturbance is the same in both cases . ''",
    "_ the above conclusion states that the more processing of the information is done before its transfer , the smaller the error introduced by the transfer delay . had the acceleration been obtained right at the test mass , there would be no delay - associated error at all .",
    "the acceleration inferred from the velocity ( [ v_fit_corr ] ) is three times less prone to the error than that inferred from the coordinate ( [ g_disturb_3 ] ) . as there is still processing involved to convert the velocity into the acceleration , the delay error is unavoidable .",
    "the reply @xcite rejects the necessity of the additional delay , leaving the disturbance term like in ( [ g_beat ] ) .",
    "the reasoning against the delay is based on its comparison with the transverse doppler shift . according to @xcite , the shift takes place in the interferometer , because the beams producing the beat signal meet at the right angle , and one of the beams come from the moving source ( fig .",
    "[ transverse]a ) .",
    "the shift decreases the observed frequency of the signal like @xmath23 the authors of @xcite have noticed that the frequency change ( [ f_transverse ] ) , if doubled and treated like in ( [ v_beat ] )  ( [ g_beat ] ) , yields the same additional disturbance ( [ v_fit_corr ] ) as the delay .",
    "unfortunately , this intriguing coincidence can not entail any meaningful interpretation , because there are several reasons why the transverse doppler shift can not exist in absolute gravimeters .",
    "[ sec_extra_delay ]    1 .   _ absence of the transverse motion .",
    "_ the transverse doppler shift @xcite decreases the observed frequency of a signal issued from the source that moves transversely to the observer s line of sight ( fig .",
    "[ transverse]b ) . in the interferometer",
    "the `` observer '' is the point on the beam splitter where the interference happens .",
    "as the test mass moves longitudinally , not transversely with respect to the beam splitter , no transverse shift is possible .",
    "volatility of the shift . _",
    "the observer moving at the right angle to the beam can see the light only during the infinitely small interval of time on which the beam coincides with the observer s line of sight ( fig .",
    "[ transverse]b ) . continuous observation of light from moving source is possible only in circular motion .",
    "as there is no rotation of the beam splitter in absolute gravimeters , the gedankenexperiment of @xcite in which the transverse doppler shift is continuously observed during the entire free - fall , is self - contradictory .",
    "_ inconsistent disturbances .",
    "_ the decrease of frequency ( [ f_transverse ] ) due to the transverse doppler shift does not depend on the direction of motion of the light source . replacing the delay ( [ v_fit_corr ] ) with the transverse doppler shift yields the same disturbance only for free - fall gravimeters with the test mass approaching the beam splitter . for other types of gravimeters , the replacement yields inconsistent results ( see table [ tbl_components ] ) . for the upper position of the interferometer ,",
    "the disturbance magnitude becomes three times less than for the lower position .",
    "the symmetric motion does not cancel the disturbances on the upward and downward branches of the trajectory .    because the transverse doppler shift can not exist in absolute gravimeters , all and any conclusions based on assuming the opposite , have no ground .",

    "that s why the corrections used in absolute gravimeters can not be considered as indicative of relativistic effects .",

    "we believe that in metrology more conservative approach to naming corrections should be used . presenting the correction for the finite speed of light in relativistic terms would create unsupported expectations of more physical content in the correction than it actually has .",
