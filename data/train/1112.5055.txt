    "[ sec : introduction ] the rapid neutron - capture process ( r - process ) is thought to be responsible for the origin of more than half of all nuclei beyond iron .",
    "while large uncertainties remain about the site of the r - process and its exact location , it is thought to occur in environments with a high density of free neutrons .",
    "there are a number of astrophysical scenarios suggested as possible sites .",
    "these include the neutrino driven wind from core - collapse supernovae  @xcite , two neutron - star mergers  @xcite , gamma - ray bursts  @xcite , black - hole neutron - star mergers  @xcite , relativistic jets associated with failed supernovae  @xcite or magnetohydrodynamic jets from supernovae  @xcite .",
    "the speed of the r - process reaction sequence and the resulting abundances of the elements are significantly influenced by the @xmath3-decay properties of the nuclei involved , which are in turn directly related to the evolution of nuclear structure and deformation . in a recent measurement of the half life of the doubly - magic nucleus @xmath8ni",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the persistence of the closed neutron and proton shells had a significant impact on the r - process abundance patterns , and theoretical predictions for the half life were significantly longer than observed .",
    "recent observations of anomalously large abundances of stable sr , y and zr in some metal - poor stars , as compared to heavier neutron - capture elements  @xcite , have brought about new questions regarding the r - process mechanism and possible site(s ) .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have interpreted these observations as evidence for a new neutron - capture light - element primary process ( lepp ) responsible for the nucleosynthesis of sr@xmath9zr elements .",
    "however , the nature of this process remains unclear .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite extracted an abundance pattern for the lepp and demonstrated that it can be associated with different origins .",
    "qian and wasserburg suggested a charge - particle reaction process ( cpr )  @xcite , which could operate in neutrino - driven winds , even in instances when conditions for an r - process are not achieved .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that sr@xmath9zr elements can be primarily produced in the low - entropy expanding envelopes of core - collapse supernovae explosions through charge - particle and neutron - capture reactions .",
    "the main motivation for the present work was to explore the possible existence of a new @xmath0=56 sub - shell and its potential impact on the r - process .",
    "_ _ _ _ whereas the presence of a @xmath0=56 sub - shell has been suggested for rb@xmath9zr elements , its persistence for lighter isotones needs further investigation .",
    "if the flow of r - process matter emerging from seed nuclei below kr were trapped in an hypothetical @xmath0=56 ladder@xmath10 , then the post freeze - out @xmath3 decay of nuclei like @xmath7ge , @xmath11as and @xmath4se would immediately translate into an enhanced production of stable sr , y , and zr elements  exactly as it occurs at the @xmath0=82 , 126 shells , leading to the well known @xmath6@xmath12130 , 195 r - process abundance peaks , respectively .",
    "we have measured the half lives of twenty - two nuclei in the @xmath6=90 region at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) .",
    "the half lives of @xmath7as and @xmath4se are reported for the first time , and more precise measurements are presented for the remaining twenty .",
    "the results are used as a nuclear - structure probe to study the deformation of the @xmath3-decay mother / daughter system , which in turn can provide first hints of the underlying shell structure ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the following sections , the experimental setup and analysis techniques employed in the present work are presented .",
    "the results are then discussed in sec .",

    "a primary @xmath5xe beam was accelerated at the nscl coupled cyclotron facility  @xcite to 120 mev / u , with an average intensity of 1.5  pna .",
    "nuclei produced by the fragmentation of the primary beam in a 235  mg/@xmath13 be target were forward - emitted into the a1900 fragment separator  @xcite .",
    "the fragments of interest were separated in - flight using the @xmath14-@xmath15-@xmath14 technique  @xcite .",
    "the first stage of the separator was set to the magnetic rigidity corresponding to the peak of the momentum distribution of @xmath7as .",
    "an achromatic wedge at the intermediate ( dispersive ) focal plane was made by combining a bc400 plastic scintillator ( i2sci ) ( 22.22  mg/@xmath13 thickness ) with a 22.51  mg/@xmath13 kapton wedge - foil .",
    "the magnets of the second half of the a1900 were set to a value corresponding to the magnetic rigidity of the @xmath7as fragment after passing through the wedge system .",
    "this provided a further filter to select a narrower group of elements .",
    "the resulting fragment cocktail was composed of @xmath16as , @xmath17se , @xmath18br , @xmath19kr , @xmath20rb , @xmath21sr , @xmath22y , and @xmath23zr .",
    "the transmitted fragments were uniquely identified event - by - event , by combining their energy - loss measured in the first silicon pin detector ( pin  1 ) of the implantation station , and the time - of - flight ( @xmath24 ) measured between i2sci and a scintillator located in the experimental area , 20  m downstream of the a1900 achromatic focal plane . to improve the @xmath24 resolution ,",
    "its dependence on the magnetic rigidity of the transmitted nuclei was corrected using the transversal position in the dispersive image plane measured with i2sci .",
    "figure  [ fig : pid ] depicts the particle - identification spectrum ( pid ) recorded during the course of the experiment for fragments transported the experimental station .     of the transmitted nuclei",
    "is shown versus their energy - loss @xmath25e in the first si pin detector at the experiment station .",
    "( see text for details.),width=302 ]    besides the fragments of interest , the known @xmath26s isomers @xmath27y and @xmath28y were included in the a1900 setting .",
    "these nuclei were used as references to identify all the fragments transmitted in the same setting .",
    "the identification was done at the start of the experiment by implanting nuclei in a 4  mm - thick aluminum foil surrounded by three @xmath29-ray detectors from the nscl segmented germanium array ( sega )  @xcite . a pid spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid ] gated on the isomeric @xmath29 lines 121 kev , 171  kev , and 204  kev from @xmath27y provided the reference for the identification of the nuclei in the cocktail .",
    "once the particle identification was established , the implantation foil was removed to transmit particles to the implantation station for the remainder of the experiment .",
    "since the magnetic rigidity values of the @xmath26s isomers and the fragments of interest were significantly different , the a1900 was set up for the maximum possible @xmath14 acceptance to allow for their simultaneous transmission .",
    "the @xmath14-window included three primary - beam charge - states @xmath5xe@xmath30 , @xmath5xe@xmath31 and @xmath5xe@xmath32 , with total intensities exceeding the maxima 1  mhz and 1  khz tolerated by i2sci and the si pin detectors , respectively .",
    "these contaminants were therefore blocked in the first image plane of the a1900 separator with a system consisting of two slits on each side of the beam axis and a central tungsten finger .",
    "nuclei transmitted through the a1900 were implanted in the nscl beta counting system ( bcs )  @xcite .",
    "the bcs was composed by a stack of four silicon pin detectors ( pin  14 ) of total thickness 2569  @xmath26 m , a 979  @xmath26m - thick 40@xmath3340 doubly - sided silicon strip detector ( dssd ) ( 40 front - side perpendicular to 40 back - side strips ) and a 988  @xmath26m - thick 16-strip single sided si strip detector ( sssd ) .",
    "a 10  mm - thick ge crystal downstream of the sssd was used for light - particle veto purposes .",
    "each pin detector was connected to a preamplifier with an energy range of 10  gev .",
    "the dssd strips were connected to dual - gain preamplifiers with ranges equivalent to 3  gev and 100  mev , so that signals from implantations and @xmath3 decays could be processed .",
    "the 16 sssd strips were connected to a 16-channel high - gain preamplifier to distinguish @xmath3-decay particles from other particles that produced low - energy signals in the dssd .",
    "the high - gain signals from the dssd and sssd preamplifiers were further processed by shaper / discriminator modules designed at washington university , st .",
    "louis , and manufactured by pico systems  @xcite .",
    "these modules include shaper and discriminator circuits sharing the same input , and provide independent logic and analogic output signals .",
    "the gain of each channel was adjusted in the beginning of the experiment to energy - match the signals from each dssd strips generated by a @xmath34th @xmath35-source .",
    "independent cfd thresholds were adjusted for each dssd strip with a @xmath4sr @xmath3-decay source .",
    "this source was also used to define two thresholds for each sssd strip , one ( @xmath36 ) above the noise peak , and the other ( @xmath37 ) just above the @xmath3-decay energy region .",
    "thresholds for each pin detectors were set on - line using the energy spectra recorded during the experiment .",
    "the dssd and the four pin detectors were energy - calibrated by comparing the signals from different transmitted nuclei with the values calculated with the lise program  @xcite , using the ziegler energy - loss formulation  @xcite .",
    "a dedicated un - wedged setting of the a1900 , transmitting a large number of different fragments , was used in the beginning of the experiment to cover as broad an energy range as possible .",
    "the total kinetic energy ( @xmath38 ) of each transmitted ion was determined by summing the calibrated energy signals from the four pin detectors and the dssd .",
    "the @xmath38 was used to determine the charge states of the transmitted ions .",
    "thus , fully - stripped nuclei could be separated from charge - state contaminants  mostly hydrogen - like ions with mass numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 helium - like ions  with similar @xmath15 and @xmath24 values .",

    "as can be seen , nearly all the charge - state contaminants were mainly implanted in the last pin . on the other hand",
    ", there was a fraction of fully - stripped nuclei of interest that passed through the dssd and were thus implanted in the sssd .",

    "decay - like events were defined by a high - gain output signal from at least one strip on each side of the dssd , in anti - coincidence with signals from any pin detector , sssd below @xmath36 ( i.e. , in the noise - peak region ) , and ge overflows generated by light particles . for each implantation event ,",
    "the strip location on each side of the dssd , defining the implanted pixel , was calculated as the average between all the strips weighted by their respective energy - signal amplitude .",
    "the implanted pixel and time , registered by a continuously counting 50  mhz clock , were recorded for all implantation events .",
    "subsequent decay - like events occurring in the same or nearest neighbor pixels ( defining a cluster of nine pixels ) within a given correlation - time window @xmath42 were associated with the previous implantation , and their times and pixels recorded . if a decay - like event was time correlated with more than one implantation measured in the same 9-pixel cluster ( back - to - back implants ) , then all the events within the sequence were rejected .",
    "data were taken in 1-hour runs over a total running time of 140 hours .",
    "several sources contributed to the @xmath3-decay background .",
    "the most important were light particles that did not lead to overflows in the ge detector and had energies in sssd below @xmath37 and above @xmath36 ( i.e. , in the @xmath3-like event region ) ; real @xmath3 decays from longer - lived nuclei implanted in the same pixel ; and electronic noise signals above the thresholds . the number of @xmath3-like events in each 9-pixel cluster occurring at a time @xmath43 after a preceding implantation was recorded for each 1-hour run time to quantify the @xmath3-decay background .",

    "up to three correlated @xmath3-decay events were accepted for each implantation , defining a @xmath3-decay chain .",
    "possible members of these chains included the @xmath3 decay of the daughter and granddaughter ; the @xmath3 decay of the daughter and granddaughter generated by @xmath3-delayed neutron emission from the implanted nucleus ; and the @xmath3 decay of the granddaughter following the @xmath3-delayed two - neutron emission from the @xmath3-decay daughter .",
    "for each implantation , the decay times @xmath48 ( with @xmath49=1 , 2 or 3 ) of the three @xmath3-decay chain members were recorded along with the background rate in the corresponding cluster .",

    "<S> * background : nuclear structure plays a significant role on the rapid neutron capture process ( r - process ) since shapes evolve with the emergence of shells and sub - shells . there was some indication in neighboring nuclei that we might find examples of a new @xmath0=56 sub - shell , which may give rise to a doubly magic @xmath1se@xmath2 nucleus . * purpose : @xmath3-decay half lives of nuclei around @xmath4se have been measured to determine if this nucleus has in fact a doubly - magic character . </S>",
    "<S> * method : the fragmentation of a @xmath5xe beam at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university was used to create a cocktail of nuclei int eh @xmath6=90 region . </S>",
    "<S> * results : we have measured the half lives of twenty - two nuclei near the r - process path in the @xmath6=90 region . </S>",
    "<S> the half lives of @xmath7as and @xmath4se have been measured for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the values were compared with theoretical predictions in the search for nuclear - deformation signatures of a @xmath0=56 sub - shell , and its possible role in the emergence of a potential doubly - magic @xmath4se . the impact of such hypothesis on the synthesis of heavy nuclei , particularly in the production of sr , y and zr elements was investigated with a weak r - process network . </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions : the new half lives agree with results obtained from a standard global qrpa model used in r - process calculations , indicating that @xmath4se has a quadrupole shape incompatible with a closed @xmath0=56 sub - shell in this region . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the measured @xmath4se half - life in comparison with a former theoretical predication associated with a spherical half - life on the weak - r - process is shown to be strong . * * * * * </S>"
