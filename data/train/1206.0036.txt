    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the fundamental theory that underlies the description of atomic nuclei , where quarks and gluons are the degrees of freedom . however , despite four decades of studying qcd , little connection has been made between qcd and low - energy many - body nuclear dynamics .",
    "the most direct computational application of qcd , lattice qcd , has made much progress in the past decades but remains some distance away from being a practical tool for computing many - body nuclear observables . for recent reviews of the outlook for lattice qcd calculations as they apply to nuclear physics see refs .",
    "while direct applications of effective field theory have made progress @xcite the characterization of atomic nuclei in terms of phenomenological two- and three - body nucleon interactions remains the standard starting point for most nuclear structure calculations .",
    "quantum monte carlo is one of the most successful methods for nuclear matter and nuclear structure calculations .",
    "green s function monte carlo has solved for many low lying states of nuclei for @xmath0 @xcite and auxiliary - field diffusion monte carlo can calculate much larger nuclei and nuclear and neutron matter @xcite .",
    "these methods have used phenomenological local real - space potentials containing as few derivatives as possible , such as the argonne - urbana family of interactions @xcite , to make sampling easy and efficient . see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of green s function monte carlo results .    however , there are other successful approaches that can reach @xmath1 and beyond .",
    "basis - set methods such as the no - core shell model @xcite and coupled - cluster techniques @xcite have typically used softer non - local potentials as these have more rapid convergence with basis - set size .",
    "these potentials are typically defined in momentum space and are often derived from chiral effective field theory such as the next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath2lo ) interaction of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "comparison of the results of basis set methods with monte carlo calculations can be difficult when different potentials are used .",
    "quantum monte carlo methods use propagation in imaginary time to project out the low - energy states of a quantum many - particle system .",
    "the propagation is performed by first writing the many - body short - imaginary - time propagator .",
    "accurate methods use a pair - product approximation @xcite where the many - body propagator is written in terms of the propagator for each pair of particles . in order to perform a quantum monte carlo calculation using an arbitrary pair potential",
    ", we need to calculate the pair propagator in imaginary time .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how to evaluate this real - space imaginary - time pair propagator needed to perform quantum monte carlo calculations using non - local potentials ( sec .",
    "ii ) , to demonstrate the consistency of the propagators using different potentials at large imaginary times ( sec .",
    "iii ) , and to discuss how to use these propagators to calculate the properties of nuclei and nuclear matter using these non - local potentials with quantum monte carlo methods ( sec .",
    "non - local potentials are typically generated in momentum space from an effective field theory . with a potential defined in momentum space , @xmath3 ,",
    "it is natural that we proceed by constructing a hamiltonian in momentum space as well .",
    "our normalization and completeness conventions for our continuous real - space and momentum - space basis states are @xmath4 @xmath5 is the separation vector of the two nucleons and @xmath6 the conjugate momentum .",
    "the overlaps between the states are @xmath7 we work in the standard channel basis where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are good quantum numbers , with the total spin , @xmath15 , the total angular momentum @xmath16 , and total isospin @xmath17 .",
    "we choose our basis states as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with normalization and completeness given by ( suppressing @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath14 ) @xmath23 the overlaps are @xmath24    for numerical work , we compactify our real space to a sphere of radius @xmath25 .",
    "we choose the dirichlet boundary condition on the sphere which forces our momentum - space spectrum to be discrete with @xmath26 being the zeros of the spherical bessel functions , @xmath27 .",
    "below we often drop the superscript @xmath28 when its value is clear from context .",
    "the discrete momentum states @xmath29 are chosen with unit normalization so that @xmath30 our transformations can now be treated as orthogonal - matrix multiplications .",
    "the momentum - space hamiltonian for the uncoupled channels where @xmath31 ( for a given set of the quantum numbers  @xmath20 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath14  which we suppress below ) is @xmath34 with @xmath35 the reduced mass . for the coupled channels where the potentials couple the @xmath36 states together the hamiltonian is    @xmath37    where the superscripts @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspond to @xmath33 or @xmath40 having values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we then construct the momentum - space , imaginary - time propagator by diagonalization of the hamiltonian , giving @xmath43 for the uncoupled channels , and @xmath44 for the coupled channels .",
    "the @xmath45 are eigenvectors of the hamiltonian with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the number of discrete momentum states we keep .",
    "we ensure that @xmath47 is large enough such that the propagators converge .",
    "an estimate of how large @xmath48 should be can be given by considering the kinetic energy alone .",
    "we want @xmath48 such that @xmath49 can be neglected . in practice",
    ", we check the convergence by doubling our estimate for @xmath48 and ensuring our results do not change to the desired precision . with these methods , it is easy to ensure that the numerical truncation errors are completely negligible .",
    "for example , for the results shown here , we use @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and the propagators have truncation errors less than @xmath52 .    after transforming to real space",
    ", we have the matrix elements @xmath53 however , for use in monte carlo codes , we want the propagators in a 3d real - space basis , @xmath54 , @xmath55 @xmath56 is a clebsch - gordan coefficient , @xmath57 a spherical harmonic .    in quantum monte carlo calculations",
    ", the particle positions are typically sampled from the central part of the propagator .",
    "the non - central parts are then included in the spin - isospin samples ( auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ) or sums ( green s function monte carlo ) .",
    "we will sample the propagators for these non - local potentials in the same way . here",
    ", we define the central part of the propagator as the trace over all spins and isospins . for convenience",
    "we also choose a particular coordinate system where the initial separation lies along the @xmath58 axis , and the final separation is in the @xmath59 plane such that we may take @xmath60 and we can visualize the central part of the propagator as a function of @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for any particular application , we can always rotate into this configuration , propagate , and rotate back . the central part of the propagator is then written as @xmath63",
    "in the limit of large imaginary times , we expect that the propagators for different potentials should agree .",
    "the propagators are essentially density matrices for the two nucleon system : @xmath64 corresponding to thermal equilibrium at the temperature @xmath65 .",
    "now , since any measurable quantity can be written as an expectation of a hermitian operator @xmath66 which can be obtained via @xmath67 , the density matrices ( propagators ) we obtain for the various potentials contain all the measurable information for this system .",
    "if the position or momentum of the nucleons could be determined with arbitrary precision , the density matrix would be in principle measurable .",
    "since the position and momentum are not well defined for arbitrary values , the propagator is not completely measurable .",
    "if the various potentials we use are phase - shift equivalent  meaning they reproduce the physical scattering data at or below @xmath68 ( @xmath69 mev )  then we would expect that starting at imaginary times @xmath70 , the various propagators should begin to agree more and more . in fact , we find that for @xmath71 , the higher - energy modes not constrained by current experimental data do not contribute substantially to the propagator .",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ eq.densitym ] ) that at @xmath72 , energies of 175 mev and above are suppressed by a factor of @xmath73 . therefore , it is not surprising that at @xmath71 , where energies of 175 mev and above are suppressed by a factor of @xmath74 we find relatively good agreement between the propagators with different potentials .",
    "this result is analogous to the renormalization group results leading to the @xmath75 potential of ref . @xcite and the similarity renormalization group results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the high energy modes are integrated out .",
    "figures [ fig:1s0diag][fig:3s13d1offdiag ] demonstrate these findings for three potentials : argonne @xmath76 ( a@xmath77 ) @xcite , n@xmath2lo , and n@xmath2lo(600 ) @xcite . for the diagonal cases , where we take @xmath78 , we define a quantum potential , @xmath79 through the equation @xmath80 with @xmath81 the free - particle hamiltonian @xmath82 in the off - diagonal cases ( @xmath83 ) we choose a particular @xmath84 value and plot against @xmath85 . for visual comparison , we subtract the free - particle propagator , @xmath86 , since at the point @xmath78 , the kinetic energy component is large and obscures the result",
    ".    figures [ fig:1s0diag][fig:3d1diag ] show the quantum potential in the singlet ( @xmath87 ) , uncoupled triplet ( @xmath88 ) , and coupled triplet ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) channels .",
    "the imaginary times chosen correspond to a typical time step used in green s function monte carlo calculations , @xmath91 and imaginary times that roughly correspond to center - of - mass energies of 350 mev , 175 mev , and 50 mev . as we have discussed above ,",
    "the imaginary time of @xmath92 is the time at which the effects attributable to energies of 175 mev and above are effectively integrated out .",
    "it is interesting to note that the agreement of the quantum potentials is only good up to @xmath93 : this is the approximate momentum value , @xmath84 , one would associate with the corresponding kinetic energy : @xmath94 .",
    "this relationship ( better and better agreement  but only up to some cut off  as the potential is evolved ) is precisely what is found in similarity renormalization group and @xmath75 approaches .    it is tempting to interpret @xmath95 as an evolution parameter for the quantum potential in the same sense that the similarity renormalization group approach has @xmath96 or @xmath97 ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however , it is not clear if a direct comparison is at all trivial . in the similarity renormalization group approach ,",
    "the evolution parameter @xmath96 ( and therefore @xmath97 , since @xmath98 ) is defined through the rather simple evolution equation for the potential @xmath99,h_s],\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is a hermitian operator that generates the transformation .",
    "( @xmath100 is often chosen to be @xmath22 , the kinetic energy ) .",
    "if we view our quantum potential akin to the similarity renormalization group s @xmath101 , our defining equation is @xmath102 we can expand this using the baker - campbell - hausdorff relation which gives an infinite series of nested commutators .",
    "the lowest order terms in an expansion in @xmath95 are @xmath103-\\tfrac{1}{2}[t,[t , v]]\\right ) + \\cdots\\ ] ] where the double commutators are suggestive of eq .",
    "( [ eq : srgevolution ] ) , but clearly not the same .",
    "the differential equation satisfied by @xmath104 is not a simple , compact expression .",
    "figures [ fig:1s0offdiag]-[fig:3s13d1offdiag ] , show the off - diagonal elements of the singlet ( @xmath87 ) , uncoupled triplet , ( @xmath88 ) , and coupled triplet ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath89-@xmath90 ) channel propagators .",
    "as discussed above , they are shifted by the free - particle result to make comparisons easier .",
    "what we can see from these figures is a general trend towards universality with at least two caveats .",
    "first , the propagators tend to converge most rapidly around the point where @xmath78 .",
    "our interpretation of this result is that low momentum transfer behavior is constrained by the phase - shift equivalence of the various potentials whereas higher momentum transfer behavior is not .",
    "second , some channels converge better than others .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig:3d1offdiag ] has still not converged at @xmath92 , and indeed , does not appear to converge well until @xmath105",
    ". this may be due to this channel s sensitivity to the tensor part of the interaction which the different potentials treat differently .",
    "these differences may point to true , quantifiable distinctions between the potentials .    even though the potentials give propagators with the same sort of long imaginary time behavior ,",
    "the many - body physics of the nucleus may not allow the use of the propagators in this regime .",
    "as mentioned above , in green s function monte carlo calculations , the imaginary time step needed to accurately approximate the many - body green s function by the pair - product is @xmath91 . for larger time steps , commutator terms in the trotter breakup spoil the approximation . since , in the pair product approximation , these commutators occur only when three nucleons are close together , this indicates that , three - body effects will also be important",
    "that is , to be able to use the propagators in the limit where they become model independent , would likely require that three- and more - body terms in both the interaction and the propagators be included .",
    "this likely means that use of potentials like @xmath75 for many - nucleon calculations will need to include many - body interactions .",
    "we now turn to the central parts of the propagators for the non - local n@xmath2lo and n@xmath2lo(600 ) potentials we have been considering throughout .",
    "since the central part of the propagator is sampled in a quantum monte carlo calculation it should be positive - definite to avoid sign problems .",
    "figures [ fig : n3locentral2000 ] and [ fig : n3lo600central2000 ] plot the central part of the propagator in real space , where the coordinates @xmath106 and @xmath107 are such that the origin corresponds to the final separation equal to the initial separation .",
    "that is , the relative coordinates are equal : @xmath108 .",
    "the precise transformation between the original coordinates , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 and the new coordinates , @xmath106 and @xmath107 is given by    @xmath112    and can be visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : coordinatesystem ] .",
    "the structure we can see is a gaussian - like peak about the initial separation as well as an antisymmetric trough at the position that corresponds to the two nucleons undergoing a position interchange : @xmath113 .",
    "the antisymmetric point is built in from tracing over the spins and isospins as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralprop ] ) , and would be present even for argonne @xmath76 .",
    "this point gives no extra difficulty  since it comes from the fermion character of the nucleons , it will be dealt with in the same way that the fermion sign problem is dealt with in green s function or auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo .",
    "that is , a path constraint @xcite is imposed that eliminates the fermion sign problem .",
    "the constraint can then be released and forward walking steps taken @xcite to improve the results and check the effect of the constraint .    however , if we zoom in on the shifted origin , as in figs .",
    "[ fig : n3lonegcentral2000 ] , and [ fig : n3lo600negcentral2000 ] , setting any positive parts of the propagator to zero , and make sure we are clear of the antisymmetric region , we find that the propagators appear to be `` ringing '' , much like friedel oscillations .",
    "these negative parts may make it more difficult to perform quantum monte carlo calculations and keep the sign problem under control . however , these negative parts are quite small , of order @xmath114 , whereas the peak of the propagator is of order @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , a typical slice through the propagator in the @xmath106 direction looks like figs .",
    "[ fig : n3locentralslice2000 ] and [ fig : n3lo600centralslice2000 ] . in many cases ,",
    "the negative parts are negligible .",
    "a straightforward method to take the small negative regions into account , is to first set any negative part ( not associated with the antisymmetry ) to zero , run a quantum monte carlo calculation until it converges , and then add the negative parts back in , in a perturbative fashion , using forward walking exactly as for the fermion sign problem .",
    "the extra sign changes from the propagator are handled in the same way as sign changes from the fermion character .",
    "we can estimate the fraction of walkers in the initial time step that may be given negative weights by comparing the integral of the absolute value of the propagators to the integral of the propagators .",
    "that is , we estimate the fraction of walkers with negative weights , @xmath116 by @xmath117 } { \\int d^3r^\\prime|g(\\bm{r},\\bm{r}^\\prime;\\tau)|}.\\ ] ] we calculate the integral over the upper half volume to exclude the interchange .",
    "for n@xmath2lo with an initial separation of 1.0 fm , we find @xmath118 .",
    "if we now take the very conservative estimate for the alpha particle that all six pairs may be this close at one time and that the negative weights are acceptable so long as the fraction of walkers with negative weights is less than @xmath73 , we find we can take approximately ten steps for n@xmath2lo [ with time step @xmath119 .",
    "green s function monte carlo typically uses forward walking of about 10 to 20 steps of @xmath120@xcite .",
    "therefore forward walking will allow us to remove any bias from the negative parts of the propagator .",
    "this can be compared to forward walking keeping the propagator constraint , but releasing the fermion constraint to separate the two effects .    in the above analysis",
    ", we have assumed that the imaginary time step used will be the same as that used in green s function monte carlo calculations with the argonne family of potentials .",
    "since the n@xmath2lo potentials are softer , the relevant commutators terms will be smaller , and longer time steps may be possible . for longer time steps",
    "there is much less ringing , and the calculations will be substantially easier .",
    "we have shown how to calculate the imaginary time pair propagators needed for quantum monte carlo calculations of nuclei and nuclear matter using non - local potentials in momentum space .",
    "the method is general enough to handle any non - local potential in momentum or real space , but in this paper , we focus on those derived from effective field theory ( n@xmath2lo ) .",
    "we find that the propagators display a universal behavior at large imaginary times , consistent with our expectations from renormalization group methods and the fact that the potentials are phase - shift equivalent , meaning that they reproduce the scattering data at or below laboratory energies of 350 mev .",
    "the central propagators sampled during monte carlo simulations for local potentials are expected to be positive - definite . without this",
    "property , sign problems can develop .",
    "we find that for n@xmath2lo with a 500 mev or 600 mev cutoff in momentum space , the central propagator is not positive definite .",
    "however , the negative parts consist of `` rings '' reminiscent of friedel oscillations and their magnitude is quite small compared with the overall shape of the central propagator . since these potentials were developed in momentum space , no attempt was made to influence their behavior in position space .",
    "it may be possible to modify the n@xmath2lo potentials in such a way that they continue to reproduce the nijmegen data with a low @xmath121 , are still relatively soft , but have reduced ringing behavior .",
    "a modification of the choice of the regulator function used in the calculation of the n@xmath2lo potentials : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the cutoff value , and @xmath124 is the order of the calculation , ( @xmath125 for n@xmath2lo ) may help . in any case , quantum monte carlo calculations should still be possible by using a modified path constraint as described above , and we are implementing these calculations .    while we have concentrated on calculating the imaginary time pair propagators from phenomenological potentials , it is amusing to note that since the few - body imaginary time propagators are simply imaginary - time correlations of the appropriate nucleon operators , they might eventually be directly extracted from lattice qcd calculations .",
