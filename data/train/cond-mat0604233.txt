    "spin - polarized transport in magnetoelectronic structures has recently attracted an intense interest largely due to their important technological applications such as non - volatile magnetic random access memories ( mrams ) , read heads for mass data storage and high sensitive magnetic sensors @xcite .",
    "the main effect is the ( giant ) magnetoresistance @xcite in magnetic multilayers and spin - valves , _",
    "i.e. _ the remarkable decrease in the resistance when the orientation of the magnetization vectors of the ferromagnetic regions change from antiparallel to parallel .",
    "a spin - valve consists of two ferromagnetic leads as the spin injector and detector , connected through a normal metal spacer which serves for the spin accumulation .",
    "recent interest in transport with noncollinear ( neither parallel nor antiparallel ) magnetizations was stimulated by the spin - transfer magnetization torque @xcite , which is essential for the new devices such as the spin - flip @xcite and spin torque transistors @xcite .",
    "the most appropriate theoretical formalism for noncollinear ferromagnet - normal metal structures is the semiclassical circuit theory @xcite which is based on dividing of the structure into the reservoirs , nodes and the junctions and expressing the currents in terms of the scattering matrices of the junctions and the isotropic electronic distributions inside the nodes and reservoirs @xcite . for the noncollinear spin - transport",
    "the spin - charge current and the corresponding distributions inside the nodes and reservoirs , as well as the scattering matrices acquire the @xmath0 matrix characteristics of the pauli spin space .",
    "the semiclassical boltzmann equations provide the standard method to calculate the noncollinear distribution matrix in a continuous bulk medium in the diffusive limit .",
    "magnetoelectronic circuit theory complemented by the boltzmann diffusion equations have been widely used to study different magnetoelectronic dc effects @xcite . in spite of this",
    "there has been little attention toward the fluctuations of the noncollinear spin - polarized current .",
    "time - dependent current fluctuations at low temperatures , the so called shot noise , provides valuable information about the transport process which are not extractable from the average current @xcite . in magnetoelectronic structures ,",
    "in which the spin of electrons plays an essential rule , the shot noise is expected to contain spin - resolved information , including spin - dependent correlations and spin accumulation and relaxation .",
    "this together with the importance of the noise in magnetoelectronic devices in view of applications motivate studying of the spin - polarized current fluctuations .",
    "the theory for current fluctuations in disorder conducting systems can be formulated by including the langevin sources of fluctuations due to the random scattering from disorders and the fluctuations of the distribution in the semiclassical boltzmann equations@xcite .",
    "the resulting boltzmann - langevin ( bl ) formalism has been used to calculate the shot noise in many mesoscopic structures and its results are widely believed to be identical with an ensemble average of the exact quantum results @xcite .",
    "one important example is the universal one - third suppression @xcite of the shot noise in a diffusive normal metal , which was correctly predicted within the bl approach @xcite .",
    "recently spin - polarized shot noise has been studied theoretically in normal metals connected by the ferromagnetic terminals with collinear magnetizations @xcite . in ref .",
    "a semiclassical bl theory of the collinear spin - polarized current fluctuations in a diffusive normal metal was developed .",
    "it was found that in a multi - terminal spin - valve structure the shot noise and the cross correlations measured between currents of two different ferromagnetic terminals can deviate substantially from the unpolarized values , depending on the spin accumulation and the spin - flip scattering strength . on the other hand",
    "only a few works @xcite have been devoted to shot noise in noncollinear systems . very recently",
    "braun _ et.al _ @xcite showed that the frequency - dependent shot noise in a quantum dot spin - valve with noncollinear magnetizations of ferromagnets in the presence of an external magnetic field can be used to detect single - spin dynamics in the quantum dot .",
    "tserkovnyak and brataas @xcite extended the circuit theory to obtain the landauer - bttiker ( lb ) formula for the shot noise of a fn contact with noncollinear magnetization .",
    "they analyzed the angular dependence of the shot noise in a n metal node connected to two f reservoirs for different types of junctions between the reservoirs and the node .",
    "however , the effect of the spin - flip scattering inside the n metal as well as the spatial variation of the noncollinear spin accumulation vector , which are essential in diffusive spin - valves with wire geometry , are disregarded so far .",
    "these effects require an extension of the bl method to include the diffusion and the relaxation of the noncollinear spin accumulation inside the diffusive n metal . to our knowledge",
    "there is no bl theory for shot noise of a noncollinear spin - polarized transport .",
    "the aim of the present work is to develop such a theory .    in this paper",
    "we develop a semiclassical bl equation for the noncollinear spin - polarized current fluctuations in the presence of the spin - flip scattering .",
    "we obtain the basic diffusion equations for the fluctuating spin - charge distribution and current matrices which allows to calculate the mean current and the correlations of the corresponding fluctuations in a diffusive normal metal connected by tunnel contacts to several f reservoirs .",
    "the developed bl equations are supplemented by the the generalized lb formula for the shot noise at the contact points@xcite .    to illustrated the main behavior of the noncollinear shot noise in magnetoelectronic systems we apply the developed bl equations to calculate the fano factor , defined as the ratio of the noise power to average current , in a two terminal fnf structure .",
    "the noncollinear orientation of the magnetizations causes a precession of the spin accumulation vector through the n metal , which in presence of the spin - flip scattering is associated with a damping as a function of the distance from the f reservoirs . for a small spin - flip intensity and a finite polarization of the tunnel contacts the precession of the spin accumulation results in a nonmonotonic angular dependence of the fano factor . for a parallel configuration fano factor",
    "is almost the same as the the normal state value but for antiparallel configuration it increases well above this value due to a large spin accumulation in the n metal .",
    "we find a substantial decrease of the fano factor at an intermediate orientation determined from the conductances of the n metal and the tunnel contacts .",
    "introducing the spin - flip scattering as well as decreasing the spin polarization diminish the nonmonotonic behavior .",
    "we present a full analysis of the magneto shot noise which demonstrates the effects of the spin - flip induced relaxation and the precession imposed by noncollinear magnetizations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii devotes to introduce the bl equation for noncollinear transport and derive diffusion equations . in section iii",
    "we calculate all possible correlations of intrinsic fluctuations and langevin sources .",
    "section iv devotes to calculate fluctuations and average of the current in double barrier fnf system .",
    "we show results for charge current shot noise in section v and finally give some conclusions in section vi .",
    "in this section we develop a semiclassical bl formalism for fluctuations of the noncollinear spin - polarized current in a diffusive normal metal connected through tunnel contacts to a number of ferromagnetic reservoirs .",
    "when the magnetization vectors of the reservoirs have a noncollinear orientation , the spin accumulation vector in the normal metal will also have a noncollinear direction with respect to the quantization axis ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the semiclassical electronic distribution is then determined by a @xmath0 matrix in the pauli spin space of the form @xmath2 the fluctuating matrix distribution function @xmath3 , depends on the momentum @xmath4 , the coordinate @xmath5 and time @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to expand @xmath7 into the charge and the spin vector distributions in terms of the @xmath8 unit matrix and the pauli matrices @xmath9 .",
    "the matrices for two distributions whose spin vector distributions are pointed in opposite directions take the form @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the charge or the spin independent part of the distribution matrix and @xmath12 the spin distribution vector whose @xmath13-component @xmath14 is spin polarization along the quantization axis and the other two components @xmath15 , @xmath16 describe the spin - polarization oriented perpendicular to the quantization axis .",

    "we assumed that @xmath29 , which follows from the detail balance principle .",
    "we also ignored dependence of the scattering rates on the spin state of electron .",
    "the langevin sources are expressed in terms of the fluctuating part of the matrix distribution as follows @xmath30 , \\label{lsimp } \\\\ * \\hat{\\xi}^{\\text{sf}}=\\int d\\mathbf{k'}w^{\\text{sf}}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k ' } ) [ \\delta\\hat{f}^-(\\mathbf{k'})-\\delta\\hat{f}^+(\\mathbf{k } ) ] .",

    "we further have shown that the spin - flip scattering diminishes the amplitude of the nonmonotonic behavior as well as the polarization effects .    in spite of a few early @xcite and recent @xcite experimental studies devoted to spin - polarized shot noise in magnetic tunnel junctions between ferrromagnets , to our knowledge ,",
    "there have not been reports on shot noise measurements in metallic spin - valve systems .",
    "we expect that such experiments will be performed in near future , which will reveal the effects predicted in the present paper ."

    "<S> we develop a semiclassical boltzmann - langevin theory of the spin polarized shot noise in a diffusive normal metal spin - valve connected by tunnel contacts to ferromagnetic reservoirs with noncollinear magnetizations . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain basic equations for correlations of the fluctuating spin - charge distribution and current density matrices by taking into account the spin - flip processes and precession of the spin accumulation vector in the normal metal . applying the developed theory to a two terminal fnf structure </S>",
    "<S> , we find that for a small spin - flip strength and a substantial polarization of the terminals the shot noise has a nonmonotonic variation with the angle between magnetization vectors . while the shot noise is almost unchanged from the normal structure value for parallel configuration and increases well above the normal value for antiparallel configuration , it suppresses substantially at an intermediate angle depending on the ratio of the conductances of the n metal and the tunnel contacts . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrated pronounced effects of the polarization and the spin - flip scattering on the shot noise which reveals the interplay between relaxation and precession of the spin accumulation vector in the n metal . </S>"
