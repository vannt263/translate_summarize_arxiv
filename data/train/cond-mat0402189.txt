    "the problem of impurities in low - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets has attracted considerable attention ever since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates.@xcite at low concentration , holes doped into the cuo@xmath6 planes are localized , or have very low mobility , and hence static impurities are relevant for understanding the initial reduction of antiferromagnetism upon doping compounds such as la@xmath6cuo@xmath7 .",
    "these impurities are expected to be magnetically frustrated.@xcite although not directly related to the breakdown of antiferromagnetism associated with the onset of superconductivity , static nonfrustrating impurities , e.g. , inert holes corresponding to substitution of cu atoms by nonmagnetic zn,@xcite also can give important information pertaining to the nature of the interactions in the cuo@xmath6 planes .",
    "the same applies to related cuprates where the planes are broken up into chains @xcite or ladders.@xcite very recently , similar impurity problems were also suggested to be of relevance to possible physical realizations of quantum computers.@xcite    on the theoretical side , heisenberg impurity models can be studied by a wide range of modern quantum many - body methods .",
    "importantly , numerical techniques , such as quantum monte carlo and the density matrix renormalization group , can give approximation - free results against which analytical approaches can be tested on a quantitative level .",
    "once such a program has been completed , the applicability of a heisenberg description to an experimental system can be judged without concerns about approximations in the calculations .",
    "there is already a large body of work devoted to various impurity effects , and a coherent picture is emerging . restricting ourselves to work on single impurities ,",
    "we note several ground state calculations for heisenberg chains,@xcite ladders , @xcite and the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice .",
    "@xcite extensive work on chains @xcite and 2d systems @xcite at finite temperature has also been carried out . in this paper",
    ", we continue our studies @xcite of finite - temperature effects of isolated static impurities in the standard 2d heisenberg model , and also present some results for the 3d system .    in a recent comprehensive quantum field - theoretical work,@xcite a low - temperature theory of an arbitrary quantum impurity in a 2d antiferromagnetic host system",
    "was developed , with the host being either in the @xmath8 magnetically ordered phase ( i.e. , in the renormalized - classical regime at @xmath9 ) or close to a quantum - critical point . in the magnetically ordered phase a leading - order classical - like curie contribution to the impurity susceptibility",
    "was predicted to stem from the coupling of the impurity moment @xmath10 to the local nel order as the temperature @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 . stimulated in part by these theoretical predictions by sachdev _",
    "et al._,@xcite we recently carried out a large - scale quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) study @xcite of the 2d @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet and confirmed the curie prefactor @xmath13 in the renormalized - classical regime , for a vacancy ( missing spin ) as well as for an added @xmath2 impurity spin .",
    "however , we also discovered a low-@xmath14 logarithmically divergent subleading contribution to the impurity susceptibility .",
    "this anomaly was attributed to the transverse component , for which a @xmath14-independent behavior had been predicted.@xcite related logarithmic divergences had also previously been found , e.g. , in an exact study of an impurity in the classical 2d heisenberg model,@xcite and in a green s function treatment of the 2d quantum model with an extra spin at @xmath8.@xcite in the latter study , the frequency dependent transverse impurity susceptibility @xmath15 was found to be log divergent when @xmath16 .",
    "more recently , an anomalous susceptibility was also found in the heisenberg model with a finite impurity concentration.@xcite    recent efforts , by sachdev and vojta @xcite and sushkov,@xcite to explain our previous numerical findings,@xcite have resulted in more complete field - theoretical descriptions where the impurity susceptibility indeed acquires a previously unnoticed subleading log divergent contribution .",
    "its principal cause can also in these analytical treatments be considered as associated with the transverse component , although there are also higher - order logarithmic contributions arising from longitudinal fluctuations .",
    "@xcite in the formulation by sachdev and vojta , @xcite which relies on an expansion of the nonlinear @xmath17 model around dimensionality @xmath18 , a very detailed form for the logarithmic corrections to the impurity susceptibility was given .",

    "( [ subir ] ) and our numerical data is quite remarkable , as will be shown in this paper .",
    "our results also agree qualitatively with the analytical results obtained by sushkov.@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to give a more complete numerical account of the effects of different types of single static impurities on the magnetic susceptibility of the 2d @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice .",
    "some of the results were previously summarized in ref .  .",
    "the impurity effects were there determined for a vacancy and an added - spin impurity , by calculating impurity susceptibilities with the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) qmc technique.@xcite the impurity susceptibility is simply the difference between the susceptibilities of the pure and doped heisenberg models . in this paper",
    "we compare our numerical results for the vacancy and added - spin impurity models with the theoretical expression in eq .",
    "( [ subir ] ) .",
    "we also consider an impurity consisting of a spin coupled ferromagnetically to its four nearest neighbors [ see fig .",

    "this coupling arrangement is nonfrustrating and can be expected to lead to an @xmath3 impurity , in contrast to the @xmath2 vacancy and added - spin impurities .",
    "it was suggested by aharony _ et al._,@xcite that hole doping the parent compounds of the cuprate superconductors could lead to effective frustrated ferromagnetic exchange couplings between nearest neighbor cu spins .",
    "motivated by this scenario , we have also considered an impurity model with a single ferromagnetic bond , and compared this with a missing bond .",
    "the 2d heisenberg antiferromagnet with two vacancies on different sublattices , and at different separations , is also studied in order to further elucidate the behavior of the single - vacancy impurity susceptibility .",
    "finally , we have considered a single vacancy in the three - dimensional ( 3d ) heisenberg antiferromagnet , for which analytical limiting expressions has also been obtained recently .",
    "@xcite although the main focus of this paper is on the susceptibility , we will also present some results for impurity effects on the internal energy and the specific heat .    in ref .",
    "we also introduced effective models for the vacancy and added - spin systems .",
    "these models are very simple few - spin systems constructed in order to capture the leading - order impurity effects ",
    "they do not contain the log corrections .",
    "they provide simple physical pictures of the dominant mechanisms at play in the full heisenberg impurity models . in this paper",
