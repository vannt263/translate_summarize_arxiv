    "c +    although high - mass ( @xmath6  @xmath3 ) stars are clue pieces in the universe and galaxy evolution , many questions remain open concerning their formation process .",
    "the root of the problem is that the kelvin - helmholtz timescale for a high - mass star is much shorter than the free - fall timescale of the natal core , and thus the star reaches the main - sequence while still accreting matter .",
    "the important amounts of uv radiation emitted by the nascent massive star should halt at some point further accretion onto the star , limiting its final mass to a certain value which is currently not well established . from a theoretical point of view , there are a number of studies showing that it is possible to form a 4050  @xmath3  star through disc - mediated accretion ( e.g. ,  yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ; krumholz et al .",
    "2009 ) , and even it seems possible to form stars of up to 140  @xmath3  ( e.g. ,  kuiper et al .  2010 , 2011 )",
    ". however , from an observational point of view , a clear picture of the different evolutionary stages that a massive star undergoes until reaching the main - sequence is lacking , mainly due to the fast evolution of massive stars .",
    "beuther & shepherd ( 2005 ) and keto ( 2007 ) suggest an observational sequence for massive star formation , where the o - type stars progenitors are b - type objects embedded in large amounts of dust and gas and accreting at large mass infall rates ( 10@xmath710@xmath8  @xmath3yr@xmath9 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the b - type object drives a collimated molecular outflow , and while progressively moving from early - b to late - o and finally early - o , the opening angle of the outflow progressively increases .",
    "thus , the earliest stages in the formation of an o - type star should be characterized by a central b - type object , driving a collimated outflow , and embedded in an infalling envelope massive enough to provide the b - type object with the required mass to become an o - type object .",
    "typically , the massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the earliest evolutionary stages also present emission from complex organic molecules ( the so - called hot molecular cores , e.g. ,  cesaroni et al .",
    "2010 ) and a lack of strong centimetre emission ( e.g. ,  beuther et al .  2002",
    "; molinari et al .  1998 ; mottram et al .  2011 ) .",
    "a possible reason for the lack of an hii region is the quenching and/or trapping of the ionized gas by the infalling dense envelope ( e.g. ,  walmsley 1995 ; molinari et al .",
    "1998 ; keto 2002 , 2003 ) , or , as recently proposed by hoare & franco ( 2007 ) , an increase of stellar radius as accretion proceeds onto the star due to trapped entropy ( the so - called ` swollen ' or ` bloated ' stars ) , which produces a decrease of the stellar effective temperature and of the uv radiation emitted by the nascent star ( e.g. ,  yorke & bodenheimer 2008 ; hosokawa , yorke , & omukai 2010 ) .",
    "thus , the study of outflow and accretion signatures in massive ysos is essential to progress in the understanding of massive star formation .",
    "however , there are only a few o - type yso candidates ( i.e. ,  with bolometric luminosities @xmath10  @xmath5 ) associated with disc - like structures or toroids of dense gas and possibly undergoing infall ( e.g. ,  zhang , ho , & ohashi 1998 ; pestalozzi et al .  2004 ; sollins & ho 2005 , sollins et al .",

    "2011 ; qiu et al .  2012",
    "; jimnez - serra et al .  2012 ; wang et al .",
    "2012 ) , and it is not clear if these massive ysos harbor true single o - type objects or a multiple system of early - b objects ( e.g. ,  naranjo - romero et al .",
    "2012 ) . this can not be easily elucidated because most of the aforementioned massive ysos undergoing infall are not detected at optical wavelengths and their spectral type can not be assessed . on the other hand , ysos with luminosities @xmath10  @xmath5  and detected in the optical / nir",
    "have been found associated with accreting disks through near - infrared observations ( e.g. ,  jiang et al .",
    "2008 ; davies et al .  2010 ; de wit et al .",
    "2010 ; kraus et al .  2010 ;",
    "wheelwright et al .  2012 ) , but their number is also scarce .",
    "thus it is extremely necessary to enlarge the sample of o - type ysos undergoing infall and actively accreting , and simultaneously detected in the optical / nir to characterize not only the infalling envelope but also the central object .",
    "the results obtained from the joint analysis of multiwavelength data presented in this paper indicate that one new actively accreting o - type ( luminosity @xmath11  @xmath5 ) candidate is iras19520 + 2759 ( r.a.(j2000)=19@xmath1254@xmath13059 and dec.(j2000)=@xmath14280741@xmath15 ) .",
    "the status of iras19520 + 2759 ( hereafter , ) has been controversial : it was originally suggested to be an oh / ir star based on its infrared colors ( habing & olnon 1984 ) .",
    "however , arquilla & kwok ( 1987 ) examined the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) images towards this region and found the far - infrared emission to be extended .",
    "this , together with its spectral energy distribution ( nearly flat from nir to 100  @xmath16 m ) , led these authors to conclude that this object was likely a young star embedded in an extended molecular cloud .",
    "in addition , arquilla & kwok ( 1987 ) present a single - dish @xmath0co  spectrum with broad wing emission ( fwzi  @xmath17  30  km  s@xmath9 ) , similar to the line wings associated with outflows in star - forming regions , and gledhill ( 2005 ) reports the detection of a polarized reflection nebula in the near - infrared .",
    "h@xmath18o  and",
    "oh maser emission with single - peaked profiles ( i.e. ,  unlike double - peaked profiles in evolved stars ) lends additional credence to the identification of this source as a yso ( engels et al.1984 , lewis et al .  1985 ) .",
    "moreover , the non detection of sio maser emission ( nakashima & deguchi 2003 ) is also consistent with the yso nature ( e.g. ,  zapata et al .",
    "2009b ) .  stands out in the infrared as the brightest and reddest object within a field of view of @xmath19  arcmin . a recent image from the spitzer mipsgal survey ( multiband imaging photometer for spitzer inner galactic plane survey , carey et al .",

    "cold dust emission from this large molecular cloud is traced by bolocam observations at 1.1 mm ( rosolowsky et al .",

    "we estimate a value for its kinematic distance of @xmath25kpc , determined from the target radial velocity ( v@xmath26@xmath17@xmath2716.5km / s ) and its galactic coordinates ( @xmath28=64.8131 , @xmath29=+00.1744 ) by assuming a simple galactic rotation law and adopting a value for the a oort constant of 14.4 km  s@xmath9kpc@xmath9 and a galactocentric radius of 8.5kpc ( kerr & lynden - bell , 1986 ) . as indicated by arquilla & kwok ( 1987 ) ,",

    "in previous sections we have shown that the ovro observations reveal a strong dust condensation , referred to as mm1 , with a total mass of around 100  @xmath3 , and which is driving a high - velocity collimated @xmath0co(10 ) outflow .",
    "the parameters of the outflow driven by mm1 , if compared to those of outflows driven by high - mass ysos , fit reasonably well the value expected for a massive yso of @xmath34  @xmath5  ( e.g. ,  wu et al .  2004 ; lpez - sepulcre et al .",
    "2009 ) , after applying a factor of @xmath35 to account for the 54% of flux filtered out by ovro ( the works reporting correlations of outflow parameters use single - dish data and thus are sensitive to the most extended emission , which has been filtered out by ovro ) .    to further compare the  envelope properties with previous works , we estimated the mass of the cloud associated with by using the bolocam image ( rosolowsky et al .  2010 ; aguirre et al .  2011 ,",

    "this cloud mass and the cs(10 ) linewidth that we have measured ( table  [ tisotop ] ) are consistent with the correlation found by beuther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a sample of high - mass protostellar objects .",
    "similarly , the @xmath1co(10 ) linewidth that we have measured follows the correlation with the bolometric luminosity found by liu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for a sample of 98 massive ysos .",
    "finally , we plotted the values of the cloud mass and the measured bolometric luminosity on the mass - luminosity plot of sridharan et al .",

    "( 2008 ) , and the values follow well the trend for massive ysos . in particular , figure 9 of molinari et al .",
    "( 2008 ) indicates that  probably is in a transition stage between actively accreting objects and the ` envelope clean - up ' phase .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that different methods used to estimate @xmath38  yield significantly different results , suggesting a non - homogenous density structure in the envelope and possibly the presence of holes and cavities . from the millimetre continuum emission we derived , assuming an homogeneous density distribution , @xmath38@xmath39  mag ( section  [ srcont ] )",
    "this is about one order of magnitude larger than the @xmath38  estimated from the fit to the sed ( total @xmath38  is @xmath40 , section  [ sased ] ) , and from the optical spectrum ( ratio of h@xmath23 to h@xmath41 yields @xmath42  mag , snchez contreras , in prep . ) , which are both along the line of sight .",
    "overall ,  is probably in a phase of main accretion and simultaneous start of envelope disruption as the jet interacts with the envelope creating a cavity .",
    "examples of massive ysos reported in the literature driving outflows and with hints of simultaneous envelope disruption are iras05506 + 2414 ( sahai et al .",
    "2008 ) and v645cyg ( hamann & persson 1989 ; clarke et al .",

    "the agreement between the position of the optical / infrared source and the millimetre source suggests that they are tracing the same object .",

    "in addition , the preliminary analysis of the optical spectrum of  presented in snchez contreras et al .",
    "( 2008 ) points to a hot object photoionizing the circumstellar gas and driving a dense and compact wind .",
    "thus , the properties of both the optical source and the millimetre source indicate that we are dealing with a young and massive object .",
    "further hints on the nature of the optical source may come from the non - detection of centimetre emission : if the central star was a ( main - sequence ) o9 star with a typical ionizing flux @xmath45s@xmath9 ( e.g. ,  panagia 1973 ; smith , norris & crowther 2002 ) , the expected 6  cm flux density from an optically thin hii region , with an electron temperature of @xmath46  k and placed at a distance of 9  kpc , would be @xmath47  mjy , which should have been well detected with the vla observations ( section  [ sovla ] )  au ) and large electron density ( @xmath48  cm@xmath8 ) , which is very unlikely because such a small size ( typical of hyper - compact hii regions , e.g. ,  kurtz 2005 ) would require a very dense envelope strongly infalling and quenching the ionized gas ( e.g. ,  walmsley 1995 ; molinari et al .",
    "1998 ) , preventing the object to be detected in the optical ( e.g. ,  g10.6@xmath270.4 : sollins & ho 2005 ; g28.20@xmath270.05 : sollins et al .  2005 ; ngc7538-irs1 : sandell et al .  2009 ) . ] .",
    "if the spectral type is b1 ( or later ) , the non - detection of the 6  cm emission is naturally explained , as the flux of ionizing photons in this case is smaller than for the o9 case by one  two orders of magnitude .      as discussed above , the centimetre properties of  are most consistent with an early - b type classification for the central star ; however , the spectral type inferred from its high luminosity , @xmath11  @xmath5 , assuming it is a zero - age - main - sequence star , is significantly earlier , o6o7 ( e.g. ,  bernasconi & maeder 1996 ; martins et al .",

    "2005 , 2011 ; beuther et al .",
    "2007b ; zapata , tang , & leurini 2010 ; furuya et al .  2011 ) , which usually show a rotation velocity pattern .",
    "all this suggests that  has been recently undergoing active accretion .",
    "hoare & franco ( 2007 ) have proposed , and numerical simulations have shown ( e.g. ,  yorke & bodenheimer 2008 ; hosokawa & omukai 2009 ; hosokawa , yorke , & omukai 2010 ) , that the main effect of accretion onto a massive star ( with mass accretion rates up to 10@xmath8  @xmath3yr@xmath9 ) , regardless of the geometry of the accretion , is an increase of the stellar radius , giving rise to the so - called ` swollen ' or ` bloated ' stars .",
    "the ` swollen - star ' scenario naturally explains the low ionizing flux observed in , even though with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath53  @xmath5 . in this scenario ,",
    "the stellar radius attains its maximum value when the star has accreted @xmath54  @xmath3  ( hosokawa , yorke , & omukai 2010 ) . assuming that this is the current value of the stellar mass of , and given the mass measured for the envelope of @xmath50  @xmath3  ( section  3 ) , the total mass which could still be accreted onto the star , for a star formation efficiency of about @xmath5420% , is 1020  @xmath3 , implying a final stellar mass of 2030  @xmath3 , which corresponds to an o - type star .",

    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * the 2.6  mm continuum emission is dominated by one strong millimetre source , mm1 , clearly associated with the bright infrared source , and which is only barely resolved , with a size of @xmath57  au , pa=@xmath58 , and a mass of @xmath50  @xmath3 .",

    "* we fitted the sed of mm1 using the sed fitting tool of robitaille et al .",

    "this bolometric luminosity one would expect that the star should emit an ionizing flux high enough to detect the free - free emission at centimetre wavelengths .",
    "however , no source associated with iras19520 + 2759 is detected at 6  cm , with a rms noise of 0.1  mjy , which could be due to on - going accretion onto the star .",
    "thus , we present evidence that iras19520 + 2759 is a luminous yso embedded in a massive and dense envelope , which is driving a collimated outflow and does not show strong centimetre emission .",
    "we propose that this could be an example of a ` swollen ' or ` bloated ' star as proposed by hosokawa , yorke , & omukai ( 2010 ) , where accretion produces an increase of the stellar radius , and a decrease of effective temperature and ionizing flux .",

    "<S> the theory of massive star formation currently suffers from a scarce observational base of massive young stellar objects to compare with . in this paper , we present interferometric @xmath0co(10 ) , @xmath1co(10 ) , c@xmath2o(10 ) , and 2.6  mm continuum images of the infrared source iras19520 + 2759 together with complementary single - dish observations of cs(10 ) , obtained with the 34 m antenna dss-54 at the madrid deep space communications complex , as well as archive images at different wavelengths . as a result from our work , </S>",
    "<S> iras19520 + 2759 , with a controversial nature in the past , is firmly established as a massive young stellar object associated with a strong and compact millimetre source and driving a collimated outflow . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a second fainter millimetre source is discovered about 4  arcsec to the south , which is also driving an outflow . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the two millimetre sources are associated with c@xmath2o  clumps elongated perpendicularly to the outflows , which may be related to rotating toroids . </S>",
    "<S> the masses of gas and dust of the millimetre sources are estimated to be around 100 and 50  @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> mm1 , the dominant source at all wavelengths , with a total luminosity of ( 12)@xmath4  @xmath5  at 9  kpc , is however not associated with 6  cm emission down to a rms noise level of 0.1 mjy . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that iras19520 + 2759 could be an example of the recent theoretical prediction of ` bloated ' or ` swollen ' star , i.e. ,  a massive young stellar object whose radius has increased due to effects of accretion at a high - mass accretion rate .
