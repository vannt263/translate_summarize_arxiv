    ", however , these systems can still display elastic behavior .",
    "for example , in the case of superconducting vortices or colloids interacting with a random substrate , when the coupling between the particles and the substrate is weak , the depinning transition is elastic and the particles keep the same neighbors as they move , as highlighted in figure 1(b ) for a 2d assembly of particles with repulsive yukawa interactions moving over a weak random substrate .",
    "the image shows that motion just above the depinning threshold is coherent , and the particles maintain their triangular ordering . for sufficiently strong particle - substrate coupling ,",
    "the nature of the depinning changes and plastic motion emerges in which a portion of the particles remain immobile while the other particles can flow around them , permitting the particles to change neighbors over time .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  1(a ) just above the depinning threshold for the same system in figure  1(b ) but with a pinning strength that is twice as large @xcite .",
    "there can also be a dynamical transition at higher drives between a liquid - like plastic flow state to a coherently moving or dynamically ordered state @xcite .",
    "sliding friction or tribology is a related phenomenon , and various frictional models have been proposed that take the form of a collection of particles siding over an ordered substrate with either fully elastic motion or with plasticity @xcite .",
    "other descriptions of atomic friction involve realistic three - dimensional all - atom simulations that allow phonon propagation and even electronic degrees of freedom to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the field of tribology is very large and is not the focus of this review ; we refer the interested reader to several excellent reviews of this field @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons why the driven dynamics of particles on ordered and disordered substrates is such a fascinating field is that it has implications well beyond the specific systems that have been studied .",
    "it provides an ideal testing ground for understanding general issues of nonequilibrium phases and nonequilibrium phase transitions ; thus , a review unifying various aspects of the field is particularly useful . in equilibrium systems , numerous well - developed concepts and procedures exist for characterizing equilibrium states of matter and the transitions between these states @xcite .",
    "the different states can be identified by symmetries in the system , while transitions between these states can be characterized by the breaking of these symmetries or the measurement of an order parameter that becomes finite or goes to zero at the transition point .",
    "such transitions can be discontinuous or first order , with hysteresis across the transition , or they can be second order , where the transition is continuous .",
    "it is also possible to have various mixed first order and second order transitions , weak first order transitions , or simply crossover behaviors .",
    "continuous transitions can fall into different universality classes which have different scaling behaviors near the transition point .",
    "a particularly powerful result of universality is that even if different systems have very different microscopic details , the essential behavior at the transition remains the same if they are in the same universality class .",
    "one of the most outstanding open questions in physics and materials science is whether systems that are out of equilibrium can also exhibit specific types of nonequilibrium states , whether there exist well - defined nonequilibrium phase transitions between such states , and whether there are universal properties of these transitions that remain the same between different systems @xcite .",
    "if a unifying framework can be established for understanding nonequilibrium systems , it would have profound implications for statistical physics , condensed matter , materials science , biological science , information science , and even the social sciences .",
    "there are many difficulties in understanding nonequilibrium phases , such as which measurable properties of the system could play the role of an order parameter , what quantities would be diverging , and where exactly the transition occurs .",
    "only recently have some systems been experimentally realized which clearly exhibit nonequilibrium phase transitions , such as transitions between different turbulent states in a liquid crystal @xcite and reversible to irreversible transitions in periodically sheared dilute colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "it would be highly desirable to identify additional model systems where such questions could be readily addressed or in which the system parameters could be easily controlled .",
    "systems that can be represented as individual particles moving over random and periodic substrates have both of these properties , making them ideally suited for testing the concepts of nonequilibrium phases . as advances in microfabrication , nanotechnology , optics , and synthesis techniques continue , more precise control over many aspects of these systems such as the strength and type of substrate and the nature of the particle - particle interactions becomes feasible . for example , in superconducting systems it is now possible to create tailored substrates with specific geometries , to control the ratio of the number of vortices to the number of pinning sites with an applied magnetic field , and to control the driving force with an applied current @xcite . in colloidal systems ,",
    "optical traps can be used to create a periodic substrate in which the depth of the traps can be readily controlled , and in many cases the interactions between the colloids can also be tuned @xcite .    in this review , we specifically highlight several different systems in which depinning and nonequilibrium phases have been studied , including vortices in superconductors interacting with random and periodic substrates in two and three dimensions , colloids driven over ordered and disordered substrates , sliding wigner crystals , and charge hopping in dot arrays .",
    "we show how the different dynamical phases have been identified , describe the possible order parameters , and examine the roles of dimensionality , ergodicity breaking , transient behaviors , and transport properties .",

    "we first consider elastic depinning , where the moving state above the depinning transition is perfectly elastic , with all the particles moving and no plastic flow so that all particles maintain the same neighbors as a function of time .",

    "similar features appear in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems ( not shown ) , which can contain 1d strings , 2d membrane - like arrays , or 3d lattices of elastically coupled particles .",
    "inclusion of a random or periodic substrate introduces a depinning threshold @xmath7 ; for drives @xmath8 the particles exhibit no steady state motion . as the driving force",
    "is increased from zero , the string , membrane , or lattice becomes increasingly rough as the depinning threshold is approached . at @xmath7 ,",
    "depinning occurs and there is a transition to an elastic sliding phase . in most cases ,",
    "the roughness of the sliding particle structure decreases for sufficiently high drives when the perturbations from the pinning sites become negligible .",
    "since the particles are elastically coupled , they keep their same neighbors over time , so that the system can be viewed as an unbreakable rubber sheet pulled over a carpet .",
    "the velocity @xmath5 at a given value of @xmath4 is taken to be the steady state time - averaged velocity of all particles in the system , @xmath9 for a sample containing @xmath10 particles which each have velocity @xmath11 that are subjected to a driving force applied along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the curve @xmath5 versus @xmath4 is referred to as a velocity - force curve .",
    "the velocity - force curves for elastic depinning transitions typically exhibit features similar to those shown schematically in figure  [ fig:4](a ) .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath7 of the driving force corresponding to the highest drive that can be applied for which the system remains pinned with no steady - state motion .",
    "this is termed the critical depinning threshold . for overdamped systems ,",
    "the average particle velocity @xmath5 in the absence of a substrate increases linearly with @xmath12 according to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the damping term . in the presence of a substrate ,",

    "fisher @xcite was one of the first to show that the pinned to sliding transition in an elastic system has similarities to a second order equilibrium phase transition , and exhibits critical phenomena in which certain quantities obey power law scaling close to the critical point @xmath22 . here , the velocity - force curve takes the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a critical exponent @xcite , while at high drives , @xmath25 the power of the approach introduced by fisher is that it suggests that the class of nonequilibrium systems that exhibit elastic depinning can be understood using an approach similar to that applied to equilibrium critical phenomena , and that if critical exponents and university classes can be identified , the same critical exponents could arise in many different types of systems even though the microscopic details and size scales of these systems could be vastly different .",
    "if @xmath22 is a critical point , other quantities such as a correlation length @xmath26 would also diverge near depinning , @xmath27 , with critical exponent @xmath28 . since this initial proposal",
    ", there has been extensive work in identifying the critical exponents for depinning in cdw models , such as the thorough study by myers and sethna who find @xmath29 in dimension @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 in @xmath33 , and @xmath34 in @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the motion in the sliding phase , transient particle rearrangements can occur below the depinning threshold if the external drive is increased by some increment and the particles adjust their positions in order to balance the driving and pinning forces .",
    "the transient time over which this motion occurs also diverges as the depinning threshold is approached .",
    "the rearrangements below @xmath22 can be viewed as avalanches of motion in which correlated groups of particles move for a time before becoming repinned , and the spatial size of the jumps of these particles can provide a measure of the correlation length @xcite .",
    "there are many complications to understanding critical behavior in driven particle systems .",
    "one example is the identification of the critical depinning threshold @xmath22 . in experiments ,",
    "the driving force is increased at a certain rate ; however , if there are transient times associated with criticality at depinning , then at some point these transient times become larger than the inverse rate at which the driving force is being swept , so the system no longer has enough time to settle back into the pinned phase and appears to depin at a drive lower than the true critical point .",
    "additionally , if inertial effects are included in the dynamics of the system , the driving rate dependence may be even stronger , or new types of dynamics could appear that change the criticality of the system or eliminate it altogether .",
    "other possible effects include retardation in modes of dissipation , which could cause local buildups of heat or strain , as well as nonuniformity in the substrate potential itself .",
    "many real materials can have large inhomogeneities in the effective pinning strength and in the spatial distribution of the pinning sites , which means that as the depinning threshold is approached , one part of the sample may reach the critical threshold before the rest of the sample , thus making a scaling analysis difficult to perform . instead of approaching the depinning threshold from below , it is possible to decrease the driving force from high values in order to approach the threshold from above ; however , it is possible that the scaling exponents could be different on each side of the transition @xcite .",
    "many models for elastic depinning are in the strongly overdamped limit and include the assumption that the damping constant is fixed ; however , in experiments it is possible for the damping constant itself to have a drive dependence if additional damping modes become excited in the sliding state .",
    "there are still many open questions in elastic depinning , particularly regarding the role of inertia and hysteresis effects .",
    "there are a growing number of biological systems such as membranes and networks that exhibit highly nonlinear elasticity , and in many cases these biological objects are moving over some type of substrate , so another direction for future research is to study depinning in systems with nonlinear elasticity @xcite .",
    "recent studies considered wrinkling transitions and crumpling in elastic sheets @xcite , and it would be interesting to see whether the ideas of wrinkling transitions could be applied to depinning of elastic sheets and membranes or to elastic depinning in curved geometries .",
    "this brings us to the next level in complexity in depinning , where some form of plasticity can occur either by the breaking and reforming of physical bonds between neighboring particles or by a change of neighbors for particles without explicit bonds . in the elastic models illustrated in figure  [ fig:2 ] ,",
    "if the pinning is very strong , it can induce such large elastic distortions in the particle assembly that a portion of the particles can move past one another a distance larger than the equilibrium lattice constant @xmath36 , so that the elastic springs connecting the particles would likely break at one or more locations . in experimental systems , where the number of particles can be very large , it is likely that even for weak random pinning there can be rare regions of strong disorder that can produce some plasticity .",
    "thus , it is of paramount importance to understand plastic deformation at depinning , and it has even been argued that plasticity is relevant in most cdw systems @xcite .    in 2d , the simplest model in which it is realistic to include plastic effects consists of unbreakable 1d elastic chains aligned parallel to each other and coupled by breakable bonds , as illustrated in figure  [ fig:3](a ) . here",
    "different depinning processes as well as a variety of dynamical phases can occur .",
    "if the pinning is weak , local variations in pinning strength are unimportant and the entire system can behave elastically and depin in a single step , as shown schematically in figure  [ fig:4](a ) . for strong",
    "pinning , local variations in pinning strength cause individual 1d chains to have different depinning thresholds @xmath37 so that the depinning is now plastic , and only the subset of chains for which @xmath38 are able to move .",
    "the moving chains slide past the remaining pinned chains , resulting in a coexistence of pinned and flowing chains . the depinning threshold of the entire system is equal to the smallest @xmath37 in the system , making plastic depinning an example of an extreme value event . as the driving force is increased , more and more chains begin to move .",
    "when @xmath39 and the depinning threshold of every chain has been exceeded , the sample enters a state in which all the 1d chains are in motion but travel with different average velocities , so that they continue to slide past one another .",
    "the difference in velocities arises since at a given @xmath4 , different chains are different distances @xmath40 above their depinning threshold . at high enough drives , @xmath40 is large for all chains and the effective pinning forces experienced by the moving chains become weak enough that the chains can dynamically recouple and form a moving elastic solid .",
    "the existence of different dynamical phases in the unbreakable 1d elastic chain system can produce signatures in the velocity - force curves as shown schematically in figure  [ fig:4](c ) , where only a portion of the particles are moving just above the depinning threshold , and cusps appear as additional chains of particles begin to move or as neighboring chains dynamically recouple .",
    "the individual particle velocity distribution function @xmath41 just above the onset of sliding can be bimodal if there is a coexistence of pinned and moving channels or if the channels form distinct groups that slide past each other , while @xmath41 becomes sharply peaked above the dynamical recoupling transition when the motion throughout the sample becomes coherent .",
    "the features in the velocity - force curves and velocity distribution functions can depend strongly on dimension , disorder , pinning strength , and inter - particle coupling .",
    "the system size is also important .",
    "for example , if plastic events occur at a specific size scale , then in systems of infinite size , the elastic response at small scales is washed out , while in small systems the behavior might appear purely elastic , and in intermediate sized systems , elastic and plastic behaviors can compete but the plastic events would be a dominant feature , so that obtaining a meaningful average velocity would be very problematic .",
    "additionally , as a function of driving force , the length scales at which plastic events occur can change .    at the next level of complexity in 2d ,",
    "the particles are free to plastically deform in any direction , such as in the samples illustrated in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "a system of this type could have isotropic or anisotropic coupling between the particles .",
    "figure  [ fig:3](b ) shows that another class of systems that allow 2d plastic deformation is an assembly of elastic line objects with their endpoints confined to two parallel planes .",
    "plastic motion with exchange of neighbors can occur parallel to the planes , but the lines remain elastic along their length . in figure  [ fig:3](c )",
    "we illustrate a 3d layered system where the particles are confined within a given layer but can exchange neighbors within that layer .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig:3](d ) illustrates an isotropic system of point particles where plasticity can occur in all directions equally .",
    "in addition to the different geometries for the particle arrangements , the substrate disorder can also have different spatial features which depend on dimensionality , such as 3d columnar , splayed , or planar defects .",
    "although all the systems highlighted in figures  [ fig:1 ] and  [ fig:3 ] exhibit plasticity , it is an open question whether there are distinct types of plastic flow phases , whether transitions between different types of plastic flow can occur , and how such phases could be characterized .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig:1](a ) illustrates a strongly fluctuating plastic flow , figure  [ fig:1](c ) shows a steady state plastic flow through fixed winding channels , figure  [ fig:1](d ) shows transient plastic flow in an avalanche event for a very slowly driven system , and figure  [ fig:1](f ) illustrates an ordered plastic flow state .",
    "all of these flows are plastic , but they may have features that would allow them to be subdivided into separate types of plastic flow . the problem of plasticity is generally considered one of the most outstanding problems in materials science , in part because systems that exhibit plasticity can have both solidlike and liquidlike properties at the same time .",
    "one well - defined question in systems with pinning is whether , under certain conditions , plastic depinning is associated with dynamical critical phenomena similar to that found for elastic depinning .",
    "for example , in the strong pinning limit where the particles are highly disordered in the pinned state , the flow just above depinning follows channels or riverlike features of the type illustrated in figure  [ fig:1](a ) . such plastic channel flow behavior has been observed in vortex systems @xcite , wigner crystals @xcite , and colloidal systems @xcite . for plastic depinning in 2d systems in the strongly amorphous limit",
    ", the velocity - force curves also appear to exhibit a scaling of the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "this is in contrast to elastic systems in 2d and higher dimensions where @xmath44 . as a result ,",
    "velocity - force curves associated with plastic depinning have a concavity opposite to that found for elastic depinning , as shown schematically in figure  [ fig:4](a , b ) which contrasts a representative example of a typical velocity - force curve for elastic depinning with @xmath45 with a plastic depinning velocity - force curve with @xmath21 .",
    "these results suggest that if plastic depinning has critical properties , it falls into a different university class than elastic depinning ; however , the existence of such criticality and its exact nature has not been verified , as measured exponents span a wide range of values from @xmath46 to @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the variation in the exponents could result from strong finite size effects , transient effects , or differences in the nature of the particle - particle interactions , or it could indicate that multiple types of criticality occur at plastic depinning due to the different dominant degrees of freedom , such as glide and climb of dislocations , kinetic barriers , and the distinction between long range interactions of the particles and long range interactions between the emergent topological defects .",
    "this also suggests that new approaches to understanding plastic depinning will be useful to understand whether plastic depinning possesses truly universal features .",
    "many of the same challenges that are faced in general studies of plasticity in crystalline and amorphous solids also arise in the plastic depinning context .",
    "just one example of a challenge in materials plasticity is the fact that stress - strain curves in amorphous systems often have different properties depending on how the material is prepared , such as a deep quench compared to a slow quench .",
    "it is likely that similar effects occur for plastic depinning ; however , little is known about how this would arise .",
    "another challenge in plastic depinning is that there can be differences between the response of systems with intermediate - range order and those in the strongly amorphous limit . in materials science",
    ", crystalline materials can exhibit plastic behavior called crystal plasticity where a well defined number of topological defects such as dislocations or grain boundaries are present and where critical behavior appears near yield that is similar to the behavior observed near depinning @xcite .",
    "this crystal plasticity is distinct from the plasticity that arises in amorphous systems where topological defects are not well defined . for the case of systems that exhibit plastic depinning transitions ,",
    "it is not known whether a similar distinction can be drawn between depinning that has properties similar to those associated with crystal plasticity and depinning that is amorphous in nature .      despite the challenges in studying plasticity",
    ", it appears that plastic depinning of particle systems in the strongly amorphous limit produces some generic features in the transport and dynamics even for very different types of interactions between the particles .",
    "figure  [ fig:4](b ) shows a schematic of a typical velocity - force curve illustrating a pinned phase at low @xmath4 , plastic depinning with @xmath48 and @xmath21 , and an overall s - shape produced by the transition to ohmic or linear velocity at high drive when the substrate becomes ineffective , associated with a peak in @xmath49 just below the ohmic regime .",
    "the presence of a peak in @xmath49 often indicates that there is a transition within the moving phase from a plastic or liquid state into a moving solid where the particles are moving so rapidly over the underlying pinning landscape that the particle - particle interactions dominate over the particle - pinning interactions , causing the particles to adopt a structure similar to that found in the substrate - free limit , which could be a triangular lattice in 2d .",
    "this suggests that there can be two generic transitions associated with plastic depinning : the depinning transition itself , and the dynamical ordering transition at higher drive .",

    "the dynamically ordered moving state can still be affected by the pinning even in the high drive limit so that the reordered structure is generally not an isotropic crystal but rather an anisotropic moving crystal @xcite , moving smectic @xcite , or even anisotropic liquid state @xcite depending on the strength of the disorder , the drive , and the dimensionality .",
    "an open issue is whether the dynamical ordering transition can be viewed as a nonequilibrium phase transition and , if so , whether the type of nonequilibrium transition can be identified .",

    "since the vortex - vortex interaction strength is controlled by gradients in the local magnetic field , as @xmath66 increases these gradients become smaller and the vortex - vortex interactions become weaker .",
    "when the vortex - vortex interactions are weak enough , dislocations can proliferate in the vortex lattice , destroy the triangular ordering , and cause a transition to plastic depinning . in the elastic regime ,",
    "when the stiff triangular lattice formed by the vortices interacts with randomly placed pinning sites , it is too energetically costly for the vortices to deform their triangular lattice in order to take advantage of the pinning energy , so many of the pinning sites remain unoccupied and therefore ineffective . once dislocations appear in the vortex lattice , however , the softened or amorphous lattice can deform easily in order to allow vortices to sit in the disordered pinning sites , so that a much higher fraction of the pinning sites are occupied and the effectiveness of the pinning increases dramatically . in other words , the stiffer triangular vortex lattice couples to the substrate more weakly than the softer amorphous vortex structure .",
    "one analogy that has been used to describe why elastic depinning occurs at a lower driving force than plastic depinning is that the elastic depinning process is akin to the easy motion of a stiff solid such as an ice cube over a carpet , while the plastic depinning process is like attempting to move a soft solid such as a gelatin cube over a carpet .",
    "the soft solid easily adjusts to fit in the asperities of the carpet and can be moved only with difficulty @xcite .",
    "the idea that softer systems are more strongly coupled to the pinning substrate applies only when the number of pinning sites is greater than or equal to the number of particles in the system .",
    "for example , consider a substrate composed of a flat surface decorated by a small number of well - defined pinning sites that can each capture no more than a single vortex . when there are more vortices than pinning sites , some of the vortices have no pinning site available in which to sit and are confined only by the vortex - vortex interaction force from their neighbors .",
    "these interstitial vortices can still be effectively pinned if enough of their neighbors are directly pinned ; however , the strength of this interstitial pinning depends on the shear modulus of the vortex lattice and not merely on the strength of the pinning sites . in a stiff elastic vortex lattice ,",
    "the strong shear modulus makes it difficult or impossible to depin the interstitial vortices separately from the vortices in the pinning sites , leading to an elastic depinning transition .",
    "if the vortex - vortex interactions are weakened substantially , then the interstitial vortices can be depinned at lower drives than the vortices in the pinning sites , resulting in a plastic depinning transition . in simulations of 2d systems containing a small number of pinning sites , when the vortex interactions are modified in order to tune the shear modulus from a high value to a low value , a very high shear modulus results in a low depinning threshold as the stiff vortex lattice depins elastically , while for a reduced shear modulus the depinning threshold increases and reaches a maximum at the onset of plastic depinning @xcite . for even smaller shear modulus values ,",
    "the depinning threshold decreases again when the vortices at the pinning sites are no longer able to exert a confining force on the interstitial vortices @xcite .",
    "it is not clear whether this model can be applied to the experimentally observed peak effect in superconducting systems since the number of intrinsic pinning sites is generally at least as large as if not greater than the number of vortices , which would imply that the pinning force should be maximal for low or zero shear modulus @xcite .",
    "it was first noted in neutron scattering experiments by thorel _",
    "that vortices can exhibit increased ordering in the moving state @xcite , while 2d vortex simulations by shi and berlinsky showed that the number of topological defects in the vortex lattice decreases with increasing drive @xcite .",
    "koshelev and vinokur ( kv ) performed 2d simulations of vortices driven over random pinning and mapped out a dynamic phase diagram containing a pinned phase , a plastic flow phase characterized by a highly defected vortex lattice , and a dynamically ordered phase at high drives where the vortices form a sixfold ordered structure @xcite .",
    "these simulations also included a thermal fluctuation force , and showed that in the absence of pinning , there is a bulk melting temperature @xmath111 above which the vortices lose their sixfold ordering . in the presence of pinning , as the temperature @xmath112 increases toward @xmath113 , the depinning threshold @xmath7 decreases while the driving force at which dynamical reordering occurs shifts to higher drives , with a divergence near @xmath113 .",
    "the divergence of the reordering force at the point at which the flow becomes liquidlike or plastic is similar to the divergence observed in the experimentally determined dynamic phase diagram of bhattacharya and higgins shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] @xcite ; however , the transition observed by kv @xcite occurs as a function of temperature rather than as a function of magnetic field .",

    ", the transverse depinning threshold can be viewed as an effective pinning force in the direction perpendicular to the channel direction that is experienced by the moving vortex channels , each of which acts like an elastic object . in further theoretical studies",

    "such a smectic phase would be generic to 2d systems .",
    "giamarchi and le doussal then proposed that the moving anisotropic bragg glass and moving smectic phase are different regimes of the same system @xcite , as shown in the schematic phase diagram of figure  [ fig : ledoussal ] as a function of disorder strength versus driving force . at low disorder strengths the system forms a dislocation - free bragg glass that depins elastically into a moving bragg glass . at higher disorder strength",

    "if a sufficiently large system were simulated , it is possible that some aligned dislocations would appear in what is labeled a moving crystal state in figure  [ fig:10 ] , indicating that the moving crystal or coupled channel phase is actually smectic at large scales .",
    "if this is the case , the moving smectic would exhibit another length scale in the form of the average spacing between dislocations .",
    "this length scale is controlled by the ratio of the vortex - vortex interaction strength to the vortex - pinning interaction strength .",
    "thus , it is possible to form a strong smectic in which each flowing channel of vortices contains numerous dislocations separated by distances of the order of a few lattice constants , as well as a weak smectic in which large groups of channels are coupled and the dislocations are separated by hundreds or thousands of lattice constants .",
    "such finite size effects could impact the results of pardo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the observation of a moving crystal phase rather than a moving smectic phase could indicate that the length scale at which dislocations appear was larger than the region over which the experimental images were obtained .",
    "despite the large number of studies on dynamical reordering in 2d vortex systems , there are still many open questions .",
    "the distances between the aligned dislocations in the smectic phase may depend on the drive and on the disorder strength , and might exhibit additional divergences .",
    "the nature of the dynamical reordering transition is unknown .",
    "it might be similar to an equilibrium freezing transition ; alternatively , it might be better understood as a type of absorbing phase transition similar to directed percolation , as described in section 12",
    ". there could be a true transition between the moving smectic and moving crystal phases , and if so , the nature of this transition is also unknown .",
    "additional transitions between different phases could occur , such as anisotropic plastic to moving nematic to moving smectic to moving crystal , and methods would need to be identified to distinguish between these phases if they are truly distinct phases . if the disorder is very weak , it is possible that only a moving floating crystal could occur , with the effects of the pinning vanishing completely ; alternatively , it is possible that the pinning effects never completely disappear .",
    "there are also some studies that find that the orientation of the mostly triangular dynamically ordered moving state can rotate as a function of driving force , but the exact reason for this rotation has not yet been identified ; it could be due to extra dissipation created by additional modes of motion of the vortex core @xcite .",
    "most of the results in section 3 were obtained in 2d or effectively 2d systems , where the depinning and dynamic reordering transitions are generally continuous or second order in nature . in this section",
    "we discuss systems in which some of these transitions are sharper or first order in character .",
    "transitions of this type can occur in overdamped 3d vortex systems and in 2d layered systems with geometries similar to those illustrated in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "first order behavior can also arise in systems containing inertia or stress overshoot effects .",
    "the system in which 3d depinning and dynamic effects have been most extensively studied is vortices in type - ii superconductors .",
    "the vortices are line - like objects , and in the limit where the lines are stiff , the 2d approximation of their behavior described in section 3 works well ; however , there are many superconducting systems that are strongly anisotropic or contain a series of superconducting layers , and in these systems the vortex lines can break up or decouple along the direction of the applied magnetic field @xcite . even for isotropic 3d superconductors or only weakly anisotropic superconductors , near @xmath97 or @xmath73 the vortex lines may become soft enough to break up along their length in the presence of strong pinning .",
    "thus , an important question is how the dynamics of interacting vortices changes when plasticity is allowed to occur in the third direction .",
    "there are numerous features observed in real superconductors , particularly near the peak effect , that have not been successfully captured in 2d simulations . in general , 2d simulations show that as the vortex - vortex interactions weaken relative to the vortex - pinning interactions , the critical depinning threshold increases gradually @xcite , while in many experiments , the increase in @xmath22 is usually much sharper .",
    "@xcite showed that the onset of the peak effect in 2h - nbse@xmath99 is very sharp when edge contamination effects are removed , and argued that the vortex order - to - disorder transition associated with the peak effect is a first order transition @xcite .",
    "near the peak effect , strong hysteresis in the velocity - force curves is commonly observed @xcite along with a variety of memory effects @xcite , indicating the presence of metastability which is consistent with an underlying first order phase transition .",
    "imaging experiments reveal the coexistence of ordered and disordered pinned phases separated by sharp , well defined boundaries , lending support to the first - order nature of the order - disorder transition @xcite . in 3d",
    "strongly layered superconducting systems , it is generally agreed that the 3d to 2d decoupling or melting transition is first order @xcite . the fact that 2d simulations do not produce many of these features is consistent with the idea that isotropic 2d systems of the type illustrated in figure  [ fig:1](a , b ) generally do not exhibit sharp transitions .",
    "the melting transitions in most 2d systems are continuous , taking the form of either a kosterlitz - thouless transition , a second order transition , or at most a weak first order transition , while when random disorder is added to 2d systems , it becomes even less likely that first order transitions can occur @xcite .",
    "the question is whether driven 3d systems in the presence of random disorder exhibit transitions that are first or second order in nature , and whether these features are consistent with what is observed in vortex experiments .",
    "most theoretical and simulation work has focused on 3d elastic line models or 3d layered models of the type illustrated in figure  [ fig:3](b , c ) . in 3d elastic line models , the vortices can exhibit plasticity in the @xmath158 plane perpendicular to their length , but not along the @xmath159 direction parallel to their length .",

    "the inset of figure  [ fig:59 ] indicates that @xmath391 diverges as a power law at @xmath409 according to @xmath444 with @xmath445 .    the behavior of periodically driven superconducting vortex systems near depinning transitions has also been examined in numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "the experiments of okuma _",
    "on a periodically sheared vortex system show diverging time scales for the system to settle into a reversible or irreversible state with @xmath442 @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the critical exponents in these different studies provides evidence that examining the transient time scales might be the most promising way to characterize nonequilibrium phase transitions in systems with pinning .",
    "criticality at reversible - irreversible transitions is currently an open topic with many new developments .",
    "for example , it was recently proposed that just at the transition , the spatial distribution of the particles is not truly random but is an example of a hyperuniform distribution @xcite .",
    "such a distribution has particular scaling features in @xmath125 , indicating that the large scale density fluctuations associated with a truly random distribution are lost @xcite .",
    "several studies of systems of particles with contact interactions have produced evidence for hyperuniformity at the critical point @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to determine whether hyperuniformity also arises near reversible - irreversible transitions in systems with longer range interactions , such as superconducting vortices , charge - stabilized colloids , or dislocations .",
    "it would also be interesting to apply the concepts of reversible - irreversible transitions to systems that undergo elastic depinning .",
    "in this case , although the system may always organize to a reversible state , there could be different types of reversible states , and there could still be a diverging time scale at transitions between these states .",
    "there is some work showing how avalanche statistics can be related to a diverging time scale near the reversible - irreversible transition in sheared materials @xcite , and it would be interesting to make a similar connection between avalanches and depinning transitions .",
    "it is possible to construct a velocity - force curve for a single probe particle driven through an assembly of other particles @xcite or a combination of other particles and pinning sites @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite found @xmath21 below the 3d glass transition and @xmath47 near the glass transition .",
    "it is not known whether the depinning process in this class of system is the same as that in collectively driven particle systems or whether it is possible for dynamical transitions to occur at higher drives .",
    "the local probe technique has been used in a variety of soft matter systems as a way to explore the rheological properties and is termed active microrheology ; the interested reader is referred to a recent review on the topic @xcite .      particle - like vortices also occur in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and there have already been theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies of bec vortices in a co - rotating optical trap array showing commensurate and incommensurate pinning transitions .",
    "the bec vortices have much less damping in their dynamics and much stronger hydrodynamic interaction effects than superconducting vortices , making them ideal for studying new types of nonequilibrium dynamics , depinning , and dynamic phases that are not accessible using superconducting vortices .",
    "experimentally it would be possible to introduce a co - rotating optical trap into the bec and determine , by slowing the rotation of the optical trap , when the vortex lattice decouples from the optical traps and whether the lattice breaks up or forms coherent patterns .",
    "there has already been some computational work on dynamic phases of bec vortices in optical trap arrays @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to create binary becs that can contain multiple species of vortices which form more complicated structures @xcite .",
    "it is not known how such vortex systems would depin or what their dynamics would be .",
    "for example , if multiple vortex species enter a moving phase , it is possible that dynamical phase separation of the different vortex species could occur into moving bands , and such structure formation would be associated with hysteresis in a velocity - force curve .",
    "the ability to pin bec vortices , colloids , and even superconducting vortices with optical traps opens the possibility of studying the effect of a time - dependent substrate on the particle dynamics .",
    "for example , the pinning sites could be periodically flashed on and off or moved around in a correlated manner . although it may seem that introducing time dependence to the pinning sites would only reduce the effectiveness of the pinning",
    ", it may be possible to introduce some type of dynamical feedback that could actually result in an increase in the pinning effectiveness .",
    "there has already been some work on colloids and vortices on time dependent substrates that shows interesting interference effects in the transport curves @xcite . in general ,",
    "driven particle dynamics on a time dependent landscape is an open area of research that could be relevant to new nanoscale devices as well as to biological systems .      in a simulation model of granular bed erosion in which particles with a short - range steric repulsive interaction are driven over a random substrate by a constant force representing a viscous fluid , yan _",
    "et al . _ @xcite find that above a threshold drive @xmath7 for motion , the plastic flow of the particles through channels is associated with a velocity scaling of @xmath446 with @xmath305 , an exponent considerably lower than that found for plastic depinning in other systems .",
    "in addition , near @xmath7 the transient time scale @xmath391 required for the system to settle into a steady state diverges as @xmath447 with @xmath448 , which is considerably larger than the values of @xmath449 to @xmath450 observed in the colloidal and vortex depinning systems described in section 12 .",
    "these unusual exponents could be an indication of strong finite size effects , where systems of extremely large size would be required to obtain the correct exponent , they could arise since the flow in this model becomes effectively 1d rather than 2d , or they could indicate that plastic flow in granular systems with short - range steric repulsive interactions falls into a different universality class than that of particles that have much longer range repulsive interactions , such as vortices , charge - stabilized colloids , or wigner crystals",
    ". it would be interesting to consider a system with short - range interactions and gradually increase the interaction range to determine how this modifies the scaling properties of the dynamics .      in active matter systems ,",
    "the particles are self - driven or self - propelled",
    ". examples of active matter include swimming bacteria , pedestrian flow , vehicular traffic , molecular motors , flocks of birds , herds of animals , and crawling cells @xcite .",
    "recently , the creation of artificial swimmers such as self - driven colloids has attracted growing attention as a means for understanding collective nonequilibrium behaviors @xcite . in most active matter studies ,",
    "the particles move over a smooth substrate or interact with a fixed number of walls . in many real systems such as swimming bacteria ,",
    "the active particles also interact with some type of disordered substrate , so the dynamics of active mater moving over random or periodic substrates will be a growing area of research . although increasing the activity level of the particles might be expected to produce effects similar to increasing the temperature , it was shown that increased activity can produce new types of behaviors such as self - clustering @xcite .",
    "studies of the mobility of active particles in disordered media under an external drive show that the mobility of the particles is nonmonotonic as a function of increasing activity , and that higher activity levels can cause the particles to become more strongly pinned @xcite . other studies of flocking models in disordered media indicate that there can be an optimal noise level that produces coherent flow @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to create active solid systems @xcite , and it would be interesting to understand whether plastic or elastic depinning can occur in such systems , and if so , in what ways the depinning differs from the depinning of non - active systems .",
    "dusty plasmas , which are composed of solid particles that become charged when they are placed in a plasma , can be modeled as repulsively interacting yukawa particles that form a triangular lattice in the strongly coupled limit @xcite .",
    "the major difference between dusty plasma systems and colloidal systems is that in dusty plasmas the particle dynamics are underdamped . due to the size scale",
    ", the speed of sound in a dusty plasma can be extremely low , making it possible to create shock waves , solitons , and other nonlinear wave phenomena with relatively small perturbations . in principle",
    "it should be possible to create dusty plasma systems in which the particles interact with some form of disordered or periodic landscape , and then to drive the particles across this landscape .",
    "studies of this type could open a new class of depinning dynamics in which inertia plays a dominant role , and it would be interesting to see how the generation of shock waves might modify the depinning transition .",
    "it is also possible to create charged colloidal systems in air which obey underdamped dynamics , while a study of charged metal balls in air has demonstrated commensurate - incommensurate pinning transitions @xcite .      over the last 30 years",
    ", various nonequilibrium fluctuation and work relations have been derived @xcite , including those of jarzynski @xcite and crooks @xcite , and these relations have been applied to a variety of systems including a colloid dragged through fluid @xcite and biological systems @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to test whether there are any conditions under which such relations hold in the nonequilibrium flowing phases of systems with pinning .",
    "there has already been some initial work in this direction for colloids moving over random @xcite and periodic @xcite substrates .",
    "topological states have been receiving growing attention in quantum systems @xcite , and similar ideas are beginning to be applied to the dynamics of classical systems as well , such as to the motion of solitons in classical mechanical insulators @xcite and to edge mobility in coupled gyroscope arrays @xcite .",
    "it is possible that some of these ideas could also be applied to systems that exhibit depinning phenomena .",
    "for example , the mobility at depinning could be limited to or enhanced along the edges of pinning array , or it may be possible to design pinning arrays in which only certain topologically restricted modes of motion can occur .",
    "in the systems described up to this point , depinning occurs on flat surfaces . there is , however , growing interest in studying particle dynamics and ordering in systems with curved geometries , such as dislocation patterns and motion on surfaces with positive or negative curvature @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to study elastic or plastic depinning phenomena on such curved geometries and compare them to the dynamics observed in flat geometries . in curved geometries ,",
    "dynamically ordered states could correlate with certain types of pattern formation of moving topological defects .      in the studies described so far ,",
    "the pinning sites or substrates remain fixed in space and only the particles can move .",
    "another class of system that is wide open for study is one in which the pinning or substrate itself is deformable or can even exhibit plasticity .",
    "such effects could come into play for particles moving over deformable membranes or elastic sheets , where the particle could create indentations in the surface that would introduce modified pairwise interactions between the particles .",
    "another possibility is that near the depinning threshold , a wrinkling transition could occur in which the system could become strongly buckled into the third dimension , and that once the particles depin , the sheet could straighten again .",
    "it could also be possible to create systems in which the pinning sites can move past each other and exhibit plasticity . for example , the pinning sites could be modeled as obeying their own equation of motion with dynamics that differ from those of the driven particles .",
    "effects of this type could occur for electron crystals pinned by charged doping sites , where the doping sites gradually electromigrate over time .",
    "it would also be possible to drive colloids through obstacle arrays in which the obstacles gradually change position .",
    "such systems could exhibit strong memory effects that can change the transport over time , and may offer a new approach for creating novel memrister type devices @xcite .",
    "one of the major areas of condensed matter physics is focused on equilibrium quantum phase transitions that are driven by quantum fluctuations @xcite . in principle there",
    "could also be nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions , in analogy with classical nonequilibrium phase transitions , and driven quantum systems that exhibit a depinning threshold or nonlinear transport at low temperatures could be ideal candidates in which to observe such effects .",
    "it might be expected that adding dynamical fluctuations to quantum fluctuations would destroy the quantum effects ; however , recent work shows that features of quantum critical states can survive in the presence of nonequilibrium noise @xcite .",
    "it may also be be possible that the application of a drive could in some cases suppress thermal noise or other dynamical noise while preserving the quantum fluctuations .",
    "open issues include what the proper methods are to measure such nonequilibrium quantum transitions , how they would differ from their classical analogs , whether there are quantum analogs to dynamical ordering transitions , and whether new types of quantum phenomena exist only in the driven phase but not in the equilibrium state .",

    "<S> we review the depinning and nonequilibrium phases of collectively interacting particle systems driven over random or periodic substrates . </S>",
    "<S> this type of system is relevant to vortices in type - ii superconductors , sliding charge density waves , electron crystals , colloids , stripe and pattern forming systems , and skyrmions , and could also have connections to jamming , glassy behaviors , and active matter . </S>",
    "<S> these systems are also ideal for exploring the broader issues of characterizing transient and steady state nonequilibrium flow phases as well as nonequilibrium phase transitions between distinct dynamical phases , analogous to phase transitions between different equilibrium states . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the differences between elastic and plastic depinning on random substrates and the different types of nonequilibrium phases which are associated with specific features in the velocity - force curves , fluctuation spectra , scaling relations , and local or global particle ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we describe how these quantities can change depending on the dimension , anisotropy , disorder strength , and the presence of hysteresis . within the moving phase </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how there can be a transition from a liquid - like state to dynamically ordered moving crystal , smectic , or nematic states . </S>",
    "<S> systems with periodic or quasiperiodic substrates can have multiple nonequilibrium second or first order transitions in the moving state between chaotic and coherent phases , and can exhibit hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss systems with competing repulsive and attractive interactions , which undergo dynamical transitions into stripes and other complex morphologies when driven over random substrates . throughout this work we highlight open issues and future directions such as absorbing phase transitions , nonequilibrium work relations , inertia , the role of non - dissipative dynamics such as magnus effects , and how these results could be extended to the broader issues of plasticity in crystals , amorphous solids , and jamming phenomena . </S>"
