    "more than 200 years ago ernst chladni pioneered the study of standing waves with his experiments on sound figures for the vibration modes of plates @xcite .",
    "the sound figures revealed that one may characterize the modes by looking at the nodal set  the lines on the plate which do not take part in the vibration and which are visualized in a sound figure . for each mode he drew the nodal pattern and counted the number of nodal lines and nodal domains . with his work he did not only lay the foundations of modern acoustics but also started a thread in theoretical and mathematical physics which lead to such classic results as sturm s oscillation theorem @xcite and which continues to this day .",
    "+ the mathematical framework starts with the laplacian @xmath1 on a compact riemannian manifold @xmath2  for the purpose of this paper it will be sufficient to consider dimension two . if the manifold has a boundary then dirichlet boundary conditions will be assumed .",
    "one studies the eigenvalue problem @xmath3 the solutions define the discrete spectrum of ( non - negative ) eigenvalues @xmath4 which we assume to be ordered @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions will be denoted @xmath6 . a nodal domain of the eigenfunction @xmath6 is a connected region in @xmath2 where the sign of @xmath6 does not change .",
    "we define the nodal count @xmath7 as the number of nodal domains in @xmath6 .",
    "the nodal counts @xmath8 form a sequence of integer numbers which characterizes the vibration modes @xmath6 on the shape @xmath2 . in case of degeneracies in the spectrum",
    "the nodal count is not uniquely defined .",
    "this may be overcome in various ways , e.g. by fixing a basis ( and an order in each degeneracy class ) .",
    "some results on nodal counts are valid for any choice for the basis of eigenfunctions  a famous example is the classic theorem by courant @xcite which states @xmath9 .",
    "more recently it has been proposed @xcite that one may use the nodal count sequence to distinguish between _ i. _ regular shapes where the laplacian is separable and the corresponding ray ( billiard ) dynamics is integrable , and _ ii . _",
    "irregular shapes where the ray dynamics is completely chaotic ( see also @xcite ) . + in the regular separable case the nodal set has a checker board pattern with crossing nodal lines . the nodal count can easily be found using sturm s oscillation theorem in both variables . in this case",
    "many properties of the nodal count sequence can be developed analytically ",
    "e.g. the statistical distribution of the scaled nodal count @xmath10 can be described by an explicit limiting function @xmath11 .",
    "this function has some generic universal features : @xmath11 is an increasing function with support @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a system dependent cut - off . near the cut - off , for @xmath14",
    "the distribution behaves as @xmath15 .",
    "+ in the irregular case no explicit counting functional is known . in this case",
    "the nodal lines generally do not have any intersections and counting nodal domains relies on numerical algorithms ( such as the hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite ) that represent the eigenfunctions on a grid of finite resolution .",
    "the numerical procedure is reliable if the resolution is high enough to resolve the distance between nodal lines near avoided intersections @xcite . for high lying eigenvalues",
    "@xmath16 the algorithm is time - consuming due to the increasing grid - size .",
    "the numerical experiments have shown that a limiting distribution @xmath11 takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a universal constant ( i.e. it does not depend on the shape ) .",
    "this and other numerical findings have been shown to be consistent with a seminal conjecture by berry @xcite which states that the statistics of eigenfunctions for an irregular ( chaotic ) shape can be modelled by the gaussian random wave ( a superposition of planar waves with the same wavelengths , random direction and random phase ) .",
    "bogomolny and schmit @xcite realized that the nodal structure of a two - dimensional random wave may be modelled by a parameter - free critical percolation model ( see also @xcite ) . with this heuristic model they were able to derive an explicit value for @xmath18 ( and other features of the nodal set ) with excellent agreement to all numerical data .",
    "one interesting implication of the critical percolation model is that nodal lines can be described by sle which has been checked affirmative in numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "meanwhile some features of the nodal count have been proven rigorously for random waves on a sphere ",
    "these rigorous results imply the @xmath19-type distribution for @xmath11 ( but can not predict the value @xmath18 ) .",
    "another interesting applications of the nodal count that we will touch in this paper are inverse questions .",
    "two inverse questions have been discussed to some detail : _",
    "i. _ can one resolve isospectrality by looking at the additional information contained in the nodal count @xcite ?",
    "can one count the shape of a drum @xcite ?",
    "in other words , does the sequence of nodal counts ( ordered by increasing eigenvalues ) determine the shape of the manifold @xmath2 ?",
    "we refer to the shape rather than the manifold itself as the nodal counts are invariant under scaling of @xmath2 . + both inverse questions have been answered affirmative for certain sets of shapes and some cases have been proven rigorously @xcite",
    ". however , most recently the first example of a pair of non - isometric manifolds with identical nodal sequences was found @xcite .",
    "+ in some cases it could be shown that the geometrical information is stored in the nodal sequence in a way which is very similar to the way it is stored in spectral functions . for instance , the nodal count sequence for regular shapes with a separable laplacian can be described by a semiclassical trace formula @xcite .",
    "this trace formula is very similar to the known trace formulas for spectral functions  it is a sum over periodic orbits ( closed ray - trajectories ) on the manifold where each term contains geometric information about the orbit .",
    "it has been shown that this trace formula can be used to count the shape of a surface of revolution @xcite .",
    "+ in the irregular case , the existence of a trace formula is an open question ( unpublished numerical experiments by the authors give some support to the existence of such a formula ) .    in the present work",
    "we continue the thread of research summarized above and consider the nodal set of the eigenfunctions of one particular shape : the right angled isosceles triangle ( i.e. the triangle with angles 45 - 45 - 90 ) . while this shape is regular with an integrable ray dynamics , the laplacian is not separable .",
    "our main result is an explicit algorithm for the nodal counts .",
    "in contrast to the numerical algorithm used for irregular shapes our algorithm is exact and does not rely on a finite resolution representation of the wave function .",
    "though the algorithm is specific to this shape , the approach may serve as the first step to generalize explicit formulas for nodal counts beyond the separable case where very few results are currently available .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture a recursion formula that allows very efficient evaluation of nodal counts for high eigenvalues .    in the remainder of the introduction",
    "we will introduce the spectrum and the basis of eigenfunctions for the right angled isosceles triangle .",
    "in section [ sec : nodalpattern ] we will discuss the nodal structure of the eigenfunctions and state the nodal count algorithm and the recursion formula as our main results . in section [ sec :",
    "applications ] we apply the nodal count algorithm to compute the distribution @xmath11 of scaled nodal counts , and discuss the consistency of the observed nodal counts with the existence of a trace formula .",

    "+ we denote the nodal count ( the number of nodal domains ) for @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "let us order the spectrum in increasing order , written as a sequence @xmath4 , such that @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is an integer function of the integers @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( we will continue to suppress the reference to @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) and we have used a mild abuse of notation by writing @xmath32 . the spectrum contains degeneracies of a number - theoretic flavour . for a @xmath33-fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath34 we define @xmath35 by ordering the degenerate values by increasing @xmath31 .",
    "this ordering is arbitrary and has been chosen for definiteness ",
    "none of our results here would change with a different choice .",
    "+ in principle one may also be interested in the nodal patterns of arbitrary eigenfunctions in a degeneracy class .",
    "indeed many physical applications may imply that the basis functions @xmath36 can not be regarded as typical as soon as one looks at a degenerate eigenvalue .",
    "however , in this paper we will focus exclusively on the nodal counts of the basis functions @xmath36  for two reasons : _ i. _ understanding the nodal patterns of arbitrary superpositions of the basis functions @xmath36 is a much harder problem which does not follow naturally from understanding just the basis ; _ ii .",
    "_ this choice of basis is natural for any computations .",
    "the current section describes the main properties of the nodal pattern of the eigenfunctions @xmath37 .",
    "these observations are then used in subsection [ sub : graphic_algorithm ] to infer an exact algorithm for counting nodal domains in the triangle .",
    "eventually , we propose a very efficient recursion formula for the nodal counts of the eigenfunctions @xmath37 in subsection [ sub : recursion ] .",
    "the eigenvalue problem on the triangle possess some symmetry properties which are revealed in the nodal pattern of the eigenfunctions , @xmath36 . specifically , there are eigenfunctions whose nodal sets show a tiling structure :    1 .   for @xmath38 with @xmath39 ,",
    "the eigenfunction @xmath36 is an antisymmetric function with respect to the line @xmath40 .",
    "this line is therefore part of the nodal set of @xmath36 .",
    "the complementary nodal set decomposes into two isometric patterns , each from either side of the line .",
    "each of these two patterns is similar to the nodal set pattern of the eigenfunction @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( figure [ figure - tiling_cases](a ) ) .",
    "+ 2 .   for @xmath38 with @xmath44 the nodal set of the eigenfunction @xmath36 consists of @xmath45 identical nodal patterns .",
    "each of these patterns is contained within a sub triangle and they are tiled together to form the complete pattern .",
    "each such sub pattern is similar to the nodal set of the eigenfunction @xmath41 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( figure [ figure - tiling_cases](b ) ) .",

    "( b)@xmath48 ]    ( a )     and ( b)@xmath48 ]    ( b )      let us now characterize the nodal set of the eigenfunction @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the nodal set of @xmath36 does not have the tiling behaviour described in section [ sub : tiling_cases ] , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "otherwise , one may reduce the values of @xmath50 , as described above , to a smaller pair @xmath51 , that does satisfy this condition , and study the nodal set of @xmath41 within the reduced triangle .",
    "in particular , it is proved in lemma [ lem : non - tiling - non - crossing ] in the appendix that for @xmath50 which satisfy the condition above , the nodal lines of the eigenfunction @xmath36 do not cross .",
    "this observation is used below to characterize the nodal set .",
    "we write the eigenfunction @xmath36 as the difference of the following two functions @xmath52 their nodal sets are correspondingly @xmath53 these are regular checkerboard patterns whose nodal domains are open rectangles and triangles ( figure [ fig - checkerboards](a ) ) .",

    "counting functions was revealed in @xcite .",

    "this paper investigates the nodal set of the laplacian eigenfunctions of the right angled isosceles triangle .",
    "the novelty of the work is the ability to obtain exact results for the nodal count although this problem is not separable .",
    "the algorithm described in section [ sub : graphic_algorithm ] constructs a graph which reflects the topology of the nodal set of a given eigenfunction .",
    "the graph contains complete and exact information about various properties of the nodal set ( such as the number of loops and the number of nodal domains ) which can be calculated straight forwardly . the standard algorithm used for computing the number of nodal domains for a known",
    "( non - separable ) eigenfunction on a drum is the hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite .",
    "it samples the eigenfunction on a grid of finite resolution .",
    "as far as we know all implementations of the hoshen - kopelman algorithm for nodal counting use a fixed grid and calculate the number of nodal domains as an approximation . in principle , one may reduce the error by increasing the resolution of the grid near avoided crossing",
    ". however , the application of this algorithm assumes a priori that there are no nodal intersections . for the special algorithm we provide here",
    "we have proven that it gives the exact result , even though it samples the eigenfunction more sparsely than the hoshen - kopelman .",
    "this also leads to a somewhat faster running time of our algorithm ( for both algorithms the running time is proportional to the energy @xmath98  however the constant of proportionality is lower for our algorithm ) .",
    "our result may be generalized to other domains where similar algorithms may apply .",
    "our algorithm is based on the fact that the eigenfunctions are presented as a linear combination of simple plane waves .",
    "it is therefore tempting to try and generalize it for other drums with similar property .",
    "the equilateral triangle is an immediate candidate ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "a further , and quite surprising , result is the recursive formula for the number of nodal loops . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first known exact formula for the nodal count of a non - separable planar manifold ( for certain eigenfunctions of tori exact formulas have been given in @xcite ) .",
    "the formula was found by direct inspection of large tables and has been verified for a large bulk of data computationally .",
    "an obvious challenge is to prove this formula . in particular ,",
    "the recursive part of the formula resembles the famous euclid algorithm for the greatest common divisor .",
    "a further investigation of the mentioned formula might therefore expose some new number theoretical properties of the nodal count .",
    "the recursive formula enables us to compute a large amount of data and to study the statistical properties of the nodal count sequence .",
    "we have studied this sequence using functions which are commonly used in research of nodal domains : the nodal count distribution and the cumulative nodal count .",
    "the nodal count distribution showed intriguing structure that resembles neither the behaviour known from separable billiards nor the one of chaotic billiards . if at all , there is some similarity to the chaotic case , where the limiting distribution is a single delta function , whereas in our case it contains a large number of peaks .",
    "+ in our analysis of the cumulative nodal count we found numerical evidence for the existence of a trace formula similar to the one recently derived for separable drums @xcite . an open question is therefore to prove the existence of a trace formula in our case , shedding more light on the question ` can one count the shape of a drum ?

    "@xmath37 being the difference of @xmath189 and @xmath190 equals zero exactly once on @xmath188 .",
    "this is true for any @xmath188 .",
