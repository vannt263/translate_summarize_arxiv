    "fluid turbulence is an archetypal phenomenon belonging to out - of - equilibrium and non - linear classical physics . starting probably with the work of reynolds , the complex and multiscale nature of turbulent velocity fluctuations",
    "is usually apprehended in a statistical way . in this spirit ,",
    "@xcite proposed in his seminal article a dimensional based argument explaining the spatial two - point correlation structure of velocity fluctuations , i.e. the 2/3-law ( see for instance classical textbooks * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as it was observed in early experimental measurements of laboratory flows .",
    "furthermore , he derived rigorously from the navier - stokes equations , using the stationary solution of the von krmn and howarth equation , the behaviour at infinite reynolds number and vanishing scale of the third order moment of velocity increments , known as the 4/5-law @xcite , reminiscent of a non vanishing mean energy transfer across scales .",
    "this gives solid ground to the following phenomenology of three dimensional homogeneous , isotropic and incompressible turbulence : energy is injected at large scale @xmath1 , the so - called integral length scale ( typically the mesh size of a grid generated turbulence in a wind tunnel , or the typical scale of propellers , etc . ) , that is then transferred to smaller scales via a direct cascading process , until it is dissipated by viscosity .    in this context , a more complete picture could be given while proposing a _",
    "stochastic _ representation of a velocity field able to reproduce in probability law the formerly described spatial structure of turbulence .",
    "in other words , we ask whether it is possible to build a random vector field @xmath2 , incompressible , statistically homogeneous and isotropic , seen as a statistically stationary solution of the navier - stokes equations , that reproduces in particular the observed 2/3 and 4/5-law",
    ".    the very first idea would be to consider a gaussian approximation .",
    "this was first considered by kolmogorov himself , and the respective process belongs to the more general class of fractional brownian motions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such a gaussian model fails to reproduce the observed and derived mean energy transfer encoded in the third - order moment of the velocity increments , as previously mentioned .",
    "however , an underlying gaussian velocity field is an appealing starting point , and we will see in the following how to modify it in order to obtain a more realistic picture that includes energy transfer .",
    "hereafter , we consider homogeneous , isotropic and incompressible velocity fields in three dimensional space , i.e. @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a regularizing scale that plays the role , in a schematic way , of the kolmogorov dissipative length scale . in a gaussian framework ,",
    "let us call @xmath6 such a field . to fully determine this gaussian velocity field",
    ", we have to prescribe its velocity components covariance , that will in particular take into account the self - similar law of kolmogorov ( i.e. the @xmath7-law ) .",
    "homogeneity , isotropy , incompressibility and the self - similar property can be modelled as a stochastic integral @xcite in the following way @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a zero - average vector gaussian white noise whose components are independent with variance equal to the infinitesimal volume @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a large - scale cut - off of characteristic extension @xmath1 ( i.e. the integral length scale ) ensuring a finite variance of this random velocity field .",
    "it is chosen radially symmetric to ensure isotropy , that is , for any vector @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the singular kernel @xmath14 is regularized over the scale @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath15 when @xmath17 ( see section [ sec : numproc ] and @xcite for further details ) .",
    "this gives differentiability to the vector field @xmath18 for any @xmath19 .",
    "the vector product @xmath20 entering equation ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) recalls the structure of the biot - savart law and ensures incompressibility ( i.e. a divergence - free vector field ) .",
    "using standard rescaling techniques ( as done in @xcite , using similar techniques from @xcite ) , it can be shown that the limiting process @xmath21 , which corresponds in a turbulent context to the limit of vanishing viscosity , is a finite variance random vector field when the so - called hurst ( or hlder ) exponent @xmath22 is strictly positive , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "let us introduce the _ velocity increments _ in order to make a connection with turbulence phenomenology and comment on the free parameter @xmath22 entering the definition of the field from equation ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) . as is usually done in the turbulence literature",

    "the longitudinal and transverse velocity increments are given by @xmath30 it can be shown , for @xmath31 , that the limiting gaussian random field @xmath32 , as we will recall in this article , is scale - invariant in the sense that moments of velocity increments , the so - called structure functions , behave as power - laws , i.e. for @xmath33 , @xmath34 \\build{\\sim}_{\\ell\\rightarrow 0}^ { } c_{2q}^{g,\\parallel}\\ell^{2qh } \\ , \\mbox { and } \\ , \\mathbb e   \\left[(\\delta_\\ell^{\\perp } u^g)^{2q}\\right ] \\build{\\sim}_{\\ell\\rightarrow 0}^ { } c^{g,\\perp}_{2q}\\ell^{2qh},\\ ] ] with @xmath35 and @xmath36 two strictly positive constants that are universal in the sense that they depend on the order @xmath37 and only on the value of the cut - off function at the origin @xmath38 ( and not on its entire shape ) .",
    "based on dimensional arguments , kolmogorov phenomenology predicts @xmath39 , that is @xmath40 , justifying the terminology of the 2/3-law .",
    "we gather the proofs in appendix [ ann : gf ] . roughly speaking",
    ", the scale - invariance property comes from the singular power - law shape of the kernel entering the definition of the gaussian velocity field in equation [ eq : gaussianfield ] .",
    "we can see that , as far as kolmogorov s 2/3-law is concerned , we can give a clear meaning ( equation [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) to a stochastic representation of a turbulent homogeneous , isotropic and incompressible velocity field .",
    "unfortunately , such a representation is too naive to reproduce the 4/5-law , that requires a non vanishing ( strictly negative ) third order moment of velocity increments , whereas the gaussian random field ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) is such that @xmath41 = \\mathbb e   \\left[(\\delta_\\ell^{\\perp } u^g)^{3}\\right ] = 0.\\ ] ]    as noted , the gaussian velocity field ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) fails to give a realistic picture of k41 phenomenology since the gaussian structure leads to vanishing odd - order correlators and thus , to a vanishing mean energy transfer across scales .",
    "furthermore , higher - order even correlators are themselves poorly predicted .",
    "this intrinsic non - gaussianity of the small scales was observed in early experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "this was taken into account by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter referred to as ko62 ) while refining the k41 theory and setting a very peculiar statistical structure of the dissipation field .",
    "this is the so - called intermittency , i.e. multifractal phenomenon ( see @xcite for a review on the subject ) .",
    "various approaches were developed in the past to provide a stochastic representation of such a dissipation field , starting probably with the _ discrete _ cascades models initiated by the russian school ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "we will prefer here to follow a continuous version of these discrete cascade models that ensures homogeneity , known as the limit - lognormal model of @xcite , rigorously studied in the framework of _ gaussian multiplicative chaos _ by @xcite ( see @xcite for recent developments on this matter ) .",
    "the aim is to model the dissipation field as a lognormal process with a long range correlation structure of the fluctuations , as observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "gaussian multiplicative chaos consists in defining such a scalar lognormal process as the exponential of a gaussian field @xmath42 with logarithmic covariance , i.e. @xmath43\\sim \\ln ( l/|{\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{y}}|)$ ] , with @xmath1 being the integral length scale .",
    "it is then possible to give a clear meaning to the scalar field @xmath44 @xcite , where @xmath45 is a dimensionless free parameter of the theory . in particular , in three dimensional space , it is then possible to show that the local average of this scalar field @xmath46 over a ball of size @xmath29 is a well - posed random field whose moments are scale invariant in the sense that @xmath47 behaves as @xmath48 , with @xmath49 a non - linear ( quadratic ) function of the order @xmath37 .",
    "as we said , such a construction is defined up to a dimensionless free parameter @xmath45 known as the intermittency coefficient that can be precisely estimated on experimental signals ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .    until now",
    ", the statistical properties of turbulence that we have mentioned concern mainly the fluctuations of the longitudinal velocity profile which is accessible with traditional experimental techniques , hot - wire anemometry in particular , and do not characterize the vector nature of the velocity field .",
    "for example , at this stage , nothing is said about the peculiar correlation structure of the components of the velocity gradients tensor @xmath50 .",
    "we are thus asking if , furthermore , it is possible to build up a differentiable velocity field ( at a finite @xmath15 ) consistent with two important properties of the velocity gradient tensor that are ( i ) the teardrop shape of the joint density of the invariants @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite and ( ii ) the preferential alignment of the vorticity vector @xmath53 with the eigenframe of the rate - of - strain matrix .",
    "going beyond the gaussian approximation ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) is a difficult matter since the mathematical theory of non - gaussian processes is far more sophisticated . in this direction ,",
    "some recent attempts by @xcite and @xcite are interesting but it is not clear whether these vector fields exhibit energy transfer .",
    "let us also mention the iterative procedure of @xcite that gives a realistic picture but which is not explicit , making analytical results out of reach at the present time .",
    "in a one - dimensional context , several models have been proposed in the literature in order to apply the discrete cascade models to reproduce synthetically the observed fluctuations of longitudinal velocity profiles , including a model for energy transfer @xcite with additional parameters and propositions to extend to spatio - temporal @xcite and lvy - based @xcite stochastic representations . in a different spirit , @xcite propose to reconstruct velocity time series , starting from a time series at a given ( small ) scale and assuming a markov property in scale . as far as we know , @xcite are the first to have proposed a compressible velocity field with non - symmetrical probability laws . to generalize their approach to incompressible velocity fields",
    ", they propose to modify the gaussian field ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) in order to include energy transfer and intermittency effects .",
    "this was done while disturbing the vector white noise field @xmath54 by the scalar multifractal measure given by the multiplicative chaos .",
    "unfortunately , for symmetry reasons , @xcite show that this incompressible intermittent velocity field has a vanishing mean energy transfer .",
    "it is tempting to think that the present picture is too heuristic to represent the complex local structure of turbulence .",
    "a further step in this direction was proposed by @xcite in which the euler equations , and more precisely the vorticity stretching mechanism , is used in order to motivate the exponentiation of a homogeneous field of isotropic symmetric trace - free gaussian matrices , that eventually lead to energy transfer .",
    "let us recall how to include some aspects of the vorticity stretching mechanism in the present picture .",
    "the euler equations reads , in the vorticity formulation , @xmath55 where @xmath2 is the velocity field , solution of the euler equation and given by the biot - savart law , i.e. @xmath56 and the deformation field @xmath57 is defined as the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor , namely @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands for matrix transpose . in incompressible flows , the deformation field",
    "is fully determined by the vorticity field and the explicit form reads @xcite @xmath60}{|{\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{z}}|^5 } + \\frac { [ ( { \\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{z}})\\wedge { \\boldsymbol{\\omega}}({\\boldsymbol{z}})]\\otimes({\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{z}})}{|{\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{z}}|^5}\\right]{\\mathrm{d}}z\\mbox { , } \\ ] ] where the integral is understood as a cauchy principal value ( p.v . ) and @xmath61 is the tensor product , i.e. @xmath62 . the first underlying idea of @xcite is to study the implication of a linearization of the previous formulation of the euler equation on the velocity field generated by the stretching of an initial gaussian vorticity field ( with a k41 structure ) by the initial deformation field .",
    "this first motivates the use of the exponentiation of a gaussian random field of symmetric matrices , although it was not expected from this short time study of the euler equations to reproduce the peculiar intermittent nature of the velocity field .",
    "this structure was introduced by hand using the gaussian multiplicative chaos that is naturally obtained while modifying the integration kernel of the deformation field ( equation [ eq : deformationpv ] ) .",
    "this heuristic procedure , motivated by the short time dynamics of the euler equations , leads to the following proposition of a velocity field representing a realistic local structure of turbulence : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an isotropic trace - free symmetric random matrix , whose structure recalls the one of the deformation field ( [ eq : deformationpv ] ) , given explicitly by a tensor wiener integral that we will specify later .",
    "the non dimensional constant @xmath0 governs the level of intermittency .",
    "let us finally remark that a crucial step of this construction , as dictated by the short - time dynamics of the euler equations , is the intrinsic dependence of this statistically isotropic matrix @xmath65 on the vector white noise @xmath54 .",
    "we can see , given a hurst exponent that we will take to be @xmath39 to be consistent with k41 phenomenology , that the proposed stochastic model ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) does depend on a single free parameter @xmath0 that can be determined empirically .",
    "therefore , if this vector field is to provide a realistic picture of the local structure of turbulence , this unique free parameter should govern at the same time both the intermittency phenomenon and the physics of the energy transfer , which is , as far as we know , a new type of relationship between these phenomena .",
    "we will indeed derive from a perturbative approach ( section [ sec : enertrans ] ) that the third order moment of velocity increments is proportional to the scale , with a multiplicative factor that is itself proportional to this free parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to go beyond the results obtained by @xcite in which the field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) has been proposed for the first time and studied mostly numerically for a single value of the intermittency coefficient @xmath0 representing in a satisfactory manner the statistical properties of turbulence . as we will see in the following quick description of the various sections of the article ,",
    "the proposed new material include ( i ) an extensive numerical study of the statistical properties of the velocity field at the smallest @xmath15 resolutions we were able to reach , for several values of the free parameter @xmath0 , ( ii ) an analytical derivation of the spectrum of exponents of the structure functions in the asymptotic limit of vanishing resolutions @xmath66 of a simplified ersatz of the field named @xmath67 and ( iii ) a perturbative approach for small @xmath0 able to capture some aspects of the energy transfer taking place while reconsidering the field @xmath68 ( equation [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) .    in section [ sec : notbas ] , we set our notation and define the field of random matrices @xmath69 .    in section [ sec : numproc ] , we describe the numerical procedure in order to obtain realizations of the velocity field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) . in short ,",
    "@xmath28 is simulated in a periodic box of size @xmath70 .",
    "we rely then on the discrete fourier transform to perform the convolutions .",
    "the matrix exponential is evaluated at each point of space using a pad approximant with scaling and squaring .",
    "the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm is used in its fully parallel form .",
    "we study then the numerical properties of the velocity field based on realizations up to @xmath71 collocation points .    in section [ sec : numa ]",
    ", we use these numerical simulations to compute the joint density of the invariants @xmath72 and @xmath73 at various intermittency coefficients @xmath0 and discuss their comparison with what is obtained in laboratory and numerical flows .",
    "similarly , we show the preferential alignment of vorticity with the intermediate eigendirection of the eigenframe of the deformation , and quantify its dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec : intermittency ] is devoted to a joint numerical and analytical study of the intermittency phenomenon observed in the velocity field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) .",
    "we will indeed observe that this field is intermittent ( in a sense that we will make precise in the devoted section ) , and its level of intermittency is given in terms of the coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the behaviour of the structure functions of the velocity field is mathematically very demanding , and even obtaining the variance of the components is a difficult task .",
    "the reason is related to the strong correlation between the exponentiated gaussian field of matrices @xmath65 and the underlying vector white noise @xmath54 . to obtain analytical results , we study an _ ersatz _ , which has the same structure as the proposed field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) but assuming the independence of the matrix @xmath65 and vector @xmath54 fields .",
    "we will call this case the _ independent _ case and note the respective velocity field @xmath74",
    ". we will show in section [ sec : intermittency ] that indeed , when properly renormalized , the velocity field @xmath74 converges towards a finite - variance process @xmath67 when @xmath75 and we will compute its respective structure functions , obtaining @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 two strictly positive constants . note that , asymptotically , higher order longitudinal and transverse structure functions share similar scaling behaviour . note also that we do not obtain perfect power - laws since an additional logarithmic factor appears in the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "this factor is related to the matrix nature of the chaos and was already observed in @xcite .",
    "this former scale dependence of structure functions is based on an exact calculation for @xmath79 , and has been extended to higher orders @xmath80 based on a conjecture proposed in @xcite .",
    "thus , this field @xmath81 allows us to understand the intermittent corrections to the scaling behaviour with respect to the gaussian case @xmath32 .",
    "the independence assumption leads on the other side to vanishing third- and more generally odd - orders structure functions , namely @xmath82 missing all the physics of energy transfer and showing that the intrinsic correlation between the matrix @xmath65 and vector @xmath54 fields in the velocity field @xmath83 ( equation [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) is crucial to reproduce non vanishing third order moment .",
    "nonetheless , we show numerically that , to fourth order , the ersatz @xmath74 and the full velocity field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) share similar intermittent properties .",
    "furthermore , an analytical study that takes into account finite - scale corrections is performed in order to interpret with high precision the numerical results . from the behaviour of the velocity increment flatness that we will define later on ( equation [ eq : flatnesses ] ) , taking into account non trivial finite - scale corrections , we are led to propose the very particular value @xmath84 for turbulent applications in order to be consistent with experimental measurements and numerical simulations .    section [ sec : enertrans ] is devoted to the physics of energy transfer . as we said ,",
    "a rigorous study of the statistical properties of the proposed velocity field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) is a difficult task . in order to discuss the important physics of the energy transfer , as required by the @xmath85-law @xcite",
    ", we will rely on a perturbative analysis of this field , at a finite resolution @xmath19 , using the intermittency parameter @xmath0 as the small parameter , which is indeed the case as far as turbulence is concerned .",
    "we show that such a perturbative expansion of the longitudinal third order velocity structure function is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 stands for a term that depends on @xmath15 but depends on a higher power of @xmath0 than 1 ( typically this term is of order @xmath88 by symmetry ) .",
    "we are then able to show that the dominating term linked to @xmath89 converges when @xmath66 towards a non trivial function @xmath90 which is such that @xmath91 with @xmath92 a constant .",
    "numerical simulations show indeed such a linear behaviour , with @xmath93 , of the third order structure function with both the intermittency coefficient @xmath0 and the scale @xmath29 when @xmath0 is small and when we use the hurst of k41 , namely @xmath39 .",
    "this shows , up to first order in @xmath0 , that the proposed velocity field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) exhibits energy transfer according to kolmogorov phenomenology .",
    "we gather in section [ sec : conclusion ] our conclusion and perspectives .",
    "in what follows , @xmath94 will denote the kronecker delta and @xmath95 the levi - civita symbol .",
    "we adopt einstein s convention of sum over repeated indices , unless explicitly stated , and we note that @xmath96 .",
    "the full vector field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) reads , with index notation , @xmath97 where the kernel @xmath98 encodes the structure of the underlying gaussian velocity field ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) and is given by @xmath99 and the following matrix field built from the very same vector white noise @xmath54 that enters the construction of the underlying structure : @xmath100 + [ ( { \\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{y}})\\wedge { \\boldsymbol{w}}({\\mathrm{d}}y ) ] \\otimes \\frac{{\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{y}}}{|{\\boldsymbol{x}}-{\\boldsymbol{y}}|^{7/2}_\\epsilon},\\ ] ] which is inspired by the tensor structure of the rate - of - strain matrix @xmath101 ( equation [ eq : deformationpv ] ) that stretches the vorticity vector along its path .",
    "we will motivate the use of the multiplicative factor @xmath102 when we give the variance and covariance of the elements of the matrix @xmath65 . at this stage ,",
    "remark that this matrix is gaussian since it is defined through a linear operation on a gaussian measure @xmath54 ( equation [ eq : xepsilon ] ) .",

    "the precise value of @xmath0 representing realistic turbulent statistics has not been selected yet .",

    "we indeed notice that in the gaussian case the flatnesses @xmath171 and @xmath172 do not depend on scale and equal 3 .",
    "then , as @xmath0 increases , for any fixed scale , the flatness increases .",
    "we observe a power law with the scale within a limited range , i.e. @xmath173 the regularization over the scale @xmath15 polluting a large part of the accessible scales .",
    "we represent in figure [ fig : flatness_fit]@xmath174 the obtained value for @xmath175 as a function of @xmath169 .",
    "we indeed see that the scaling exponents @xmath175 decrease when @xmath0 increases , showing the augmentation on the level of intermittency @xcite .",
    "we observe also , in this context , that the level of intermittency of transverse velocity increments is higher than the one observed on longitudinal velocity increments . in laboratory and numerical flows",

    "thus , turbulence statistics seem to be well reproduced for a very particular small value of the parameter @xmath177 , which was already found in @xcite .",
    "the present velocity field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) is an example of random process that exhibits a higher level of intermittency for the transverse case than for the longitudinal case .",
    "this is indeed a surprising effect , also observed in real flows ( see discussions in @xcite ) . in our model",
    ", only an analytical study could give a clear answer to this observed discrepancy , in particular in the asymptotic limit @xmath178 .",
    "unfortunately , the underlying mathematical structure of this field is subtle , the strong correlation between the field @xmath65 and the white measure @xmath54 is difficult to handle . in the following , we will study both numerically and theoretically an _ ersatz _",

    "as we show in appendix [ ann : indeptcase ] , the field ( [ eq : multifractalfieldindicesindpt ] ) needs to be renormalized in order to converge , when @xmath126 , towards a finite - variance process .",

    "we can see that the difference between the full vector field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) and the one just mentioned ( [ eq : multifractalfieldindicesindpt ] ) is that the matrix free field @xmath65 and the vector white noise @xmath54 are independent .",
    "this is a strong simplification but we can get simple exact results .      we perform similar simulations of the velocity field @xmath74 ( [ eq : multifractalfieldindicesindpt ] ) as we did for the ( dependent ) velocity field @xmath83 ( [ eq : multifractalfieldindices ] ) and compare the estimation of velocity increment flatnesses .",
    "we display our results in figures [ fig : flatness](b , d ) and [ fig : flatness_fit](b ) .    overall , at any value of the parameter @xmath0 , both velocity fields @xmath83 and @xmath188 share qualitatively similar levels of intermittency .",
    "this gives confidence in explaining the intermittent properties of @xmath83 ( [ eq : multifractalfieldindices ] ) using results from the intermittent nature of the velocity field ersatz @xmath74 ( [ eq : multifractalfieldindicesindpt ] ) , which is amenable to analytical derivation .",
    "the main difference , as far as intermittency is concerned , comes from the behaviour of the flatness of transverse velocity increments .",
    "we observe indeed that in the independent case , the observed power - laws of the flatnesses @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( equation [ eq : flatnesses ] ) have the same scaling exponent @xmath189 ( [ eq : flatnessesexpo ] ) , a property that we show in the following sections .",
    "also , as we will see , the velocity field ersatz @xmath74 does not exhibit energy transfer .",
    "in other words , @xmath74 is a good ersatz to study the intermittent nature of the velocity field @xmath83 , but fails at describing the physics of energy transfer .",
    "this reveals also the great importance of building up the matrix field @xmath65 from the very same white measure @xmath54 in order to predict energy transfer .",

    "this shows that the velocity field @xmath67 ( [ eq : multifractalfieldindicesindpt ] ) , built assuming independence of @xmath211 and @xmath54 , is intermittent , and the respective flatnesses ( [ eq : flatnesses ] ) behave as power - laws times a logarithmic correction with the scale @xmath29 ( see annex [ ann : indeptcase ] ) : @xmath212 thus , according to this asymptotic prediction ( [ eq : predindflat ] ) , the power - law exponents of the flatness are the same and related to the parameter @xmath0 , namely @xmath213 .",

    "the mathematical theory developed in @xcite allows us not only to derive its asymptotic structure in the double limits @xmath66 and then @xmath205 as we have already seen , but also in the limit @xmath126 at a finite scale @xmath29 .",

    "if now we take a look at the value of the skewness we are obtaining in the numerical simulation for the parameter @xmath302 , without invoking the perturbative expansion ( see figure [ fig : skew]b ) , we find @xmath303 which is very close to what is obtained in real flows ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this theoretical and numerical study shows that indeed the proposed velocity field @xmath28 ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) , and for the first time as far as we know , exhibits non vanishing and realistic energy transfer .",
    "we have studied the statistical properties of an explicit random velocity field ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) able to reproduce the main properties of a fully developed turbulent flow , as observed in experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "to do so , we have performed simulations up to @xmath71 grid points , and developed analytical techniques when calculations were possible .",
    "this claimed realistic picture of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence includes the teardrop shape of the joint density of the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor and the preferential alignment of vorticity with the eigenframe of the deformation matrix ( section [ sec : numa ] ) .",

    "as we explained , such a strong simplification forbids energy transfer . in order to obtain some insights in the physics of energy transfer",
    ", we perform a perturbative expansion of the full vector field in powers of @xmath0 and show that at first order , the field exhibits a non vanishing third order moment of longitudinal velocity increments , establishing the dissipative nature of the field .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with kolmogorov s @xmath85-law , although the precise value of the prefactor @xmath85 is not predicted since it requires a link ( and thus an additional free parameter ) between the regularization scale @xmath15 and the kinematic viscosity @xmath145 .",
    "nonetheless , we are led to the conclusion that the proposed velocity field is realistic of turbulence when we set @xmath84 , a value that has been obtained when comparing the power - law behaviour of the flatness ( see equation [ eq : flatnessesexpo ] ) with experimental findings , taking into account finite - size corrections to the scalings .    as far as we know , the velocity field @xmath28 ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) is the first stochastic process proposed in the literature that is able to predict a non vanishing mean energy transfer across scales .",
    "at least numerically , and supported by the perturbative expansion performed in section [ sec : enertrans ] , it seems that the non vanishing nature of the third order moment of longitudinal velocity increments remains in the asymptotic limit @xmath66 .",
    "this justifies the term _ dissipative _ used in the title of the present article and gives hope to define one day rigorously the limiting velocity field @xmath305 as a stochastic representation of weak solutions of the euler equations , as they are depicted in onsager s contribution to turbulence ( see the review article @xcite on this subject ) .",
    "in particular , the modern view of energy transfer of @xcite shows that standard local energy budget is possibly violated by an additional dissipative term , independent of viscosity , related to the non differential nature of the velocity field",

    "let us mention first the usefulness of such a random field in the context of mean square estimation @xcite and related conditional averages as far as turbulent applications are concerned ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , such a procedure can be used to provide new types of closures of the subgrid stress tensor while performing a large eddy simulation @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that a gaussian velocity field is able to reproduce non trivial properties of the pressure hessian that enters the dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor ( see * ? ? ?",
    "more precisely , it is shown numerically in @xcite that the following average of the hessian of the pressure @xmath306 conditioned on the local velocity gradient tensor @xmath158 , i.e. @xmath307,\\ ] ] is well approximated , when compared against direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations , if one assumes the velocity field to be gaussian , such as @xmath32 ( [ eq : gaussianfield ] ) .",
    "further analytical work in this direction by @xcite shows that indeed the prediction of this conditional average starting from a gaussian velocity field is able , when slightly modified , to regularize the finite - time divergence implied by the self - stretching term .",
    "these results could then be extended while assuming for the velocity field a stochastic structure such as the one we are proposing ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) . a first step in this direction",
    "could be reached assuming furthermore independence of the multiplicative chaos on the underlying white measure because this simplification makes calculations tractable ( section [ sec : indptcase ] ) .",
    "finally let us comment on the remaining free parameter @xmath0 that governs both energy transfer and the intermittency phenomenon in our velocity field @xmath28 ( [ eq : multifractalfield ] ) .",
    "it would be much welcome to use further constraints from the equations of motion in order to set its value that would compare in an appropriate way against experiments .",
