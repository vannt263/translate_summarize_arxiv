    "a novel methodology was recently proposed to automatically search for underlying analytical laws in data @xcite .",
    "its importance has been highlighted into astronomy by @xcite , and this letter is the first attempt to use it in a cosmological context .",
    "we applied the aforementioned method to derive an analytic expression for photometric redshift ( photo-_z _ ) determination from sloan digital sky survey 10th data release spectroscopic sample of galaxies ( sdss - dr10 , * ? ? ?",
    "our goal here is to demonstrate the potential of machine proposed analytical relations in providing simple and reliable photo-_z_.    due to the variety of spectra occurring in nature ( as there are several types of galaxies , of different ages , metallicities , star - forming histories , merging histories , etc . ) , the unicity of photometric redshift estimates is not assured for any sample .",
    "nevertheless , the large amount of data expected to be observed by surveys like the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite , euclid @xcite or wide - field survey infrared telescope @xcite makes it infeasible to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for all their objects with the current and likely near future technology .",
    "therefore making photo-_z _ is the only viable solution for estimating redshifts in such large scale .",
    "photo-_z _ methods have been widely used in fields as diverse as gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , luminous red galaxies ( lrgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at the same time , numerous efforts to accurately determine photo-_z _ were reported ( for a glimpse on the diversity of existent methods , see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . to deepen our understanding of the differences between photo-_z _ techniques ,",
    "@xcite compared results from six methods applied to lrgs .",
    "they show 1-@xmath12 scatters between 0.057 and 0.097 when averaged over the considered redshift range ( @xmath13 ) , systematically presenting poor accuracy at low ( @xmath14 0.4 ) and high ( @xmath15 0.7 ) redshifts .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a wider comparison enclosing 16 different methods .",
    "the methods perform better in simulated than real data , with empirical codes showing smaller biases than template - fitting ones .",
    "the existing approaches are usually divided in two classes : empirical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and template - fitting - based methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the former uses magnitudes and/or colours of a spectroscopically measured sample for training the method , which is then applied to the photometric sample .",
    "the latter , try to find spectral template and redshift which best fit the photometric observations using a library of well know observational or synthetic spectra .",
    "the main advantage of the approach adopted in this letter is that without any _ a priori _ physical information nor _ ad hoc _ functional form , it empirically derives analytical expressions from the data . besides that , the error propagation from the observables can be straightforwardly performed into the redshift estimate .",
    "also , due to its analytic nature , the outcomes are more tractable , and thus interpretable , than the outcomes of other methods , such as neural - networks or support vector machines , for instance . finally , the resulting expressions are promptly portable , and might be even incorporated on - the - fly via _ structured query language _ ( sql ) when retrieving catalogue data , for instance .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows . in section [ sec : method ] , we give a broad picture of the methodology followed in this letter .",
    "then , section [ sec : data ] , provides an overview of the adopted dataset .",
    "afterwards , we present our results and compare with the recent literature in in section [ sec : res ] . finally , conclusions are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the ultimate goal of symbolic regression - based techniques is to find a functional form that explains hidden associations in datasets , while optimizing a given error metric ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is fundamentally distinct from linear and non - linear regression methods that fit parameters for an _ a priori _ analytical expression . in symbolic regression ,",
    "the machine searches the best expression and the optimal coefficients simultaneously .",
    "we used the software eureqa @xcite to test the application of symbolic regression for photo-_z _ determination .",
    "it allows the user to choose atomic function blocks ( basic mathematical operations , exponentials , logarithms , boolean operators , trigonometric functions , etc . ) .",
    "then , eureqa scans through the data and a variety of combinations between the atomic function blocks are evolved through genetic programming @xcite , optimizing conciseness and accuracy .",
    "lastly , the outcome functions are ordered according to their complexity and quality of the fit .",
    "the application of eureqa to our problem follows a straightforward approach .",
    "first , a subset of galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts is used to derive an analytical expression that optimally predicts the redshift from the magnitude and colour data .",
    "in other words , an expression whose evaluation minimizes the mean absolute error when compared to the data . to seek simplicity while keeping accuracy , we only allowed the use of simple mathematical operations ( + , - , , / ) .",
    "afterwards , the obtained expression is applied to a larger sample of galaxies with spectroscopic measurements , to perform a strict validation of the expression s predictive capability against real spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the data adopted in this work was selected from the sdss - dr10 spectroscopic sample .",
    "this includes hundreds of thousands of new galaxies and quasars spectra from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) in addition to all imaging and spectra from prior sdss data releases .    from this dataset , we selected all objects with spectroscopic measurements ( table ` specobj ` ) classified as galaxies ( flag ` specobj.class = galaxy ` ) and whose spectra were free from known problems ( flag ` specobj.zwarning = 0 ` ) .",
    "moreover , only sources with clean photometric measurements ( flag ` photoobj.clean = 1 ` ) were accepted .",
    "the sql query used in sdss casjobs service was    ....",
    "select s.specobjid , g.u , g.g , g.r , g.i , g.z ,          s.z as redshift          into mydb.specobjallz_cleanphoto   from specobj as s join galaxy as g        on s.specobjid = g.specobjid , photoobj where class = ' galaxy ' and zwarning = 0         and g.objid = photoobj.objid         and photoobj.clean=1 ....    where s.specobjid is the object identification in the spectral tables , and g.u , g.g , g.r , g.i , g.z , s.z represent the sdss _ ugriz _ model magnitudes and measured spectroscopic redshift , respectively .",
    "this resulted into a dataset containing @xmath16 objects , from which we retained only galaxies with @xmath17 .",
    "additionally , all possible color combinations based on the available photometric bands were computed .",
    "we divided the data into two subsets , one for deriving the analytic expression and another for validation and error assessment . to mitigate biases created by unbalanced data",
    ", we randomly selected @xmath18 galaxies per redshift bin ( width @xmath19 ) up to @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 , half of all available objects in each redshift bin were used for deriving the expression .",
    "this comprises a total of @xmath1 galaxies that were used for searching the expression .",
    "then , the accuracy ( systematic errors ) and precision ( random errors ) of this expression was assessed based on other @xmath7 objects .",
    "we only considered objects with @xmath22 .",
    "finally , we did not apply any cuts in magnitude , quality of spectroscopic redshift measurement nor galaxy types .",

    "given its analytical nature , eq .",
    "[ equationthephotozer ] allows a straightforward error propagation from the uncertainties in the measured magnitudes to the final photometric redshift .",
    "note the missing @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands in the former equation .",
    "such behavior was observed in several equations constructed by eureqa , suggesting that a competitive performance might be reached using only three sdss photometric bands .",
    "interestingly , the two sdss filters kept out of the derived equation are those which do not bracket the main spectral feature for imprinting redshift signature in photometry , for the redshift range considered in this work : the @xmath25  break .",
    "this does not mean that these filters carry null information .",
    "instead , it only highlights that the bulk of information relevant to photometric redshift determination relies on the other filters . due to a compromise between error and complexity during the optimization procedure ,",
    "only the most relevant filters survive to the output equations . moreover , the expressions assembled by eureqa are not simply high order polynomials with additional terms , but more intricate combinations of magnitudes in different filters .",
    "accordingly , expressions with more terms are not necessarily expected to improve redshift estimates , as additional terms might even introduce degeneracies .    to test the performance of eq .",

    "one can promptly notice that @xmath8 is well recovered by @xmath0 with reasonable accuracy .",
    "furthermore , a reasonable match between @xmath8 and @xmath0 distributions can be observed ( upper and right panels , respectively ) .",

    "each `` violin '' centre represents the median of the distribution , while the shape , its the mirrored pdf .",
    "the drop in medians at high redshifts ( @xmath28 ) indicates that @xmath0 systematically underestimates @xmath8 at this range .",
    "this might be caused by poor statistics : in the full dataset , at @xmath29 there are only @xmath30 objects , while for @xmath31 there are @xmath32 .",
    "this underweights the contribution of high-_z _ objects to the construction of eq .",
    "( [ equationthephotozer ] ) .",
    "accordingly , for bins with equally balanced number of galaxies ( @xmath33 ) , no obvious systematic effects are seen .",
