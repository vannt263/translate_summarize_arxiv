    "alice receives a bit @xmath1 , and bob receives a bit @xmath2 , both chosen uniformly at random .",
    "their task is to output one bit each in such a way that the xor of the bits they output is equal to @xmath3 . in other words",
    ", they should output the same bit , except when both input bits are @xmath4 .",
    "notice that no communication is allowed between them . a moment",
    "s reflection shows that their best strategy is to always output , say , @xmath5 .",
    "this allows them to win on three of the four possible inputs .",
    "it is also not difficult to show that equipping them with a shared source of randomness can not help : the average success probability over the four possible questions will always be at most @xmath6 ( simply because one can always fix the shared randomness so as to maximize the average success probability ) .",
    "this bound of @xmath6 , known as the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality , is the simplest example of a _ bell inequality _ @xcite .",
    "a remarkable and well - known fact is that if alice and bob are allowed to share _ quantum entanglement _ then they can win the game with probability @xmath7 , no matter which questions are asked . indeed",
    ", sharing entanglement allows remote parties to realize correlations that are impossible to obtain classically , without imparting them with the ability to communicate instantaneously .",
    "this distinction is one of the most peculiar aspects of quantum theory and required many years to be properly understood  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the topic of quantum correlations from a communication complexity perspective .",
    "namely , we are asking how many bits of communication are needed to explain the phenomenon of quantum correlations .",
    "more precisely , we consider the following communication complexity problem , corresponding to the quantum mechanical scenario of a shared bipartite quantum state @xmath8 and local two - outcome measurements @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with the goal being to simulate the correlation ( i.e. , the parity ) of the measurement results .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the protocol is given as protocol [ prot : maximal - k - bit ] . roughly speaking ,",
    "alice and bob start by projecting their vectors onto a random @xmath11-dimensional subspace .",
    "alice then sends to bob the orthant inside the @xmath11-dimensional space in which her vector lies , and bob uses the half - space determined by this orthant to determine his output . to be more precise , instead of",
    "a random orthogonal projection we use here a random gaussian matrix @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to a much cleaner analysis , and moreover , in the limit of large @xmath13 , the two distributions are essentially the same .",
    "we also use the same trick used in the majority protocol to reduce the communication from the naive @xmath11 bits to @xmath14 bits .",
    "we now analyze the correlation function given by this protocol . for any unit vectors @xmath15 , the output of the protocol satisfies @xmath16 & =     { { \\mathrm e}}[\\operatorname{sign}[\\alpha_0 \\cdot { { \\langle { g\\vec b , ( 1,c_1,\\ldots , c_{k } ) } \\rangle } } ] ] \\\\     & = { { \\mathrm e}}[\\operatorname{sign}[{{\\langle { g\\vec b , ( \\alpha_0,\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_{k } ) } \\rangle } } ] ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where expectations are taken over the choice of @xmath12 .",
    "the expression inside the last expectation is @xmath17 or @xmath18 depending on whether @xmath19 is in the half - space defined by the center of the orthant containing @xmath20 . by symmetry",
    "it is enough to consider the positive orthant , and hence the above is equal to @xmath21 - 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now claim that the joint distribution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a @xmath24-dimensional gaussian variable with mean @xmath5 and covariance matrix @xmath25 where each @xmath26 is a @xmath27 identity matrix and @xmath8 denotes the inner product @xmath28 . to see this , notice that by the rotational invariance of the gaussian distribution , we can assume that @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "the claim now follows by using the fact that the first two columns of @xmath12 are two independent @xmath31-dimensional standard gaussians , i.e. , a gaussian with mean 0 and covariance @xmath26 .",
    "our next observation is that the probability in eq .   depends only on the sum of coordinates of @xmath19 .",
    "we therefore define the real random variable @xmath32 to be @xmath33 .",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath22 and @xmath32 is given by a @xmath34-dimensional gaussian with mean @xmath5 and covariance matrix @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the linear transformation taking @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore see that the probability in eq .",
    "is exactly the probability that a vector sampled from a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath5 and covariance matrix @xmath39 is in the positive orthant .    by the cholesky decomposition , we can write @xmath40 for the @xmath41 matrix @xmath42 it is easy to see that @xmath43 since @xmath44 , applying the linear transformation @xmath45 to a gaussian random variable with mean @xmath5 and covariance matrix @xmath39 transforms it into a standard gaussian variable . under this transformation , the positive orthant , which is",
    "the cone spanned by the standard basis vectors , becomes the cone spanned by the rows of @xmath46 .",
    "we conclude that the probability in eq .",
    "is exactly the probability that a vector sampled from a standard gaussian distribution is in the cone spanned by the rows of @xmath46 . by the spherical symmetry of the standard gaussian distribution",
    ", we can equivalently ask for the relative area of the sphere @xmath47 that is contained inside the cone spanned by the rows of @xmath46 .",
    "[ [ the - case - k0 ] ] the case @xmath48 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we can now compute the probability in eq .   for each of @xmath49 .",
    "we start with the simplest case of @xmath48 . here",
    ", we are interested in the relative length of the circle @xmath50 contained in the cone spanned by the rows of @xmath46 .",
    "obviously , this is given by the angle between the two vectors divided by @xmath51 , which is @xmath52 .",
    "hence by eq .",
    "the correlation function in this case is simply @xmath53 we could also obtain this result by noting that the @xmath48 protocol is essentially identical to the one from section  [ ssec : localprim ] .    [ [ the - case - k1 ] ] the case @xmath54 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now analyze the more interesting case @xmath54 . here , we are interested in the relative area of the sphere @xmath55 contained in the cone spanned by the three rows of @xmath46 . the intersection of @xmath55 with a cone spanned by three vectors is known as a _",
    "spherical triangle _ , see figure [ fig : sphericaltriangle ] .",
    "its area , as given by girard s formula ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 278 ) ) , is @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the three angles of the triangle ( as measured on the surface ) . in more detail , if @xmath58 are the vectors spanning the cone , then @xmath59 is the angle between the two vectors obtained by projecting @xmath60 and @xmath61 on the plane orthogonal to @xmath62 ( and similarly for @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . in our case , the cone",
    "is spanned by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "clearly @xmath68 and a short calculation shows that @xmath69 . plugging this into girard s formula , and using the fact that the area of the sphere is @xmath70 , we obtain that the relative area of @xmath55 contained in the cone spanned by the rows of @xmath46 is @xmath71 . hence by eq .",
    "the correlation function in this case is @xmath72    [ [ the - case - k2 ] ] the case @xmath73 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we finally arrive at the most important case @xmath73 . here",
    "we are considering _ spherical tetrahedra _",
    ", defined as the intersection of @xmath74 with a cone spanned by four vectors . unlike the case of spherical triangles , no closed formula is known for the volume of a spherical tetrahedron ( see @xcite for further discussion and references ) .",
    "fortunately , there is a simple formula for the _ derivative _ of the volume , as we describe in the sequel .",
    "we start with some preliminaries on spherical tetrahedra , closely following appendix a in @xcite .",
    "a spherical tetrahedron is defined by four unit vectors @xmath75 forming its vertices . for @xmath76 let @xmath77 be the angle between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath80 is the spherical length of the edge @xmath81 .",
    "another set of six parameters associated with a spherical tetrahedron are its _ dihedral angles _ @xmath82 , @xmath76 , describing the angle between the two faces meeting at the edge @xmath81 .",
    "they are defined as @xmath83 and similarly for the other five dihedral angles , where the _ high - dimensional inner product _ is defined as @xmath84 and the _ high - dimensional norm _ is given by @xmath85 finally , in order to compute the volume of a spherical tetrahedron we use a formula due to schlfli @xcite , which says that for every @xmath86 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the volume of a spherical tetrahedron with the given edge lengths .",
    "our goal is to compute the volume of the spherical tetrahedron whose vertices are the rows of @xmath46 normalized to be of norm @xmath4 , @xmath89 from this it easily follows that @xmath90 moreover , a straightforward calculation reveals that @xmath91 and that the derivative of the latter term as a function of @xmath8 is @xmath92 . by using schlfli s formula and integrating along @xmath8",
    ", we obtain that the volume of our spherical tetrahedron is @xmath93 where we used that for @xmath94 this volume is @xmath5 . since the total area of @xmath74 is @xmath95 , we obtain using eq .   that the correlation function in this case is @xmath96",
    "in this section we describe how to take any protocol whose correlation function is ` strong enough ' , and use it to solve problem  [ prob : simulatingclassical ] .",
    "this section as well as the next one rely on some basic facts from the theory of real analytic functions which can be found in , e.g. , @xcite . as we said earlier",
    ", the idea is to carefully choose a mapping @xmath97 such that when alice and bob apply the protocol on @xmath98 and @xmath99 , the resulting correlation function will be correct .",
    "alice and bob map their vectors to @xmath98 and @xmath99 and run the original protocol on these vectors .",
    "fix some arbitrary correlation function @xmath100 \\to [ -1,1]$ ] .",
    "we now give sufficient conditions on @xmath101 under which the required transformation @xmath97 exists .",
    "first , we require that @xmath102 and that @xmath101 is odd , continuous , and monotonically increasing .",

    "finally , we require that @xmath106 and @xmath107 for all @xmath108 .    in section  [ sec : powerseries ] we will show that the orthant protocol with @xmath73 satisfies these properties . a crucial fact for our protocol",
    "is that under the above requirements on @xmath101 , the power series of @xmath109 converges on @xmath110 $ ] and all its coefficients are nonnegative .",
    "this is shown in the following lemma .",
    "[ lemma:1 ] if @xmath101 satisfies the above conditions , then @xmath109 has a power series expansion @xmath111 that converges on @xmath110 $ ] and satisfies @xmath112 for all @xmath113 .",
    "we first notice that under the above conditions , the power series in eq .   converges to @xmath101 also at the endpoints @xmath114 .",
    "this is easy to prove and follows from abel s lemma , which says that if all but finitely many of the coefficients of a power series are nonnegative ( or nonpositive ) , then the value of the series at the endpoints is given by the limit of its values as we approach the endpoint .",
    "we hence see that @xmath115 .",
    "it also follows easily that the inverse function @xmath116 \\to [ -1,1]$ ] is well - defined and is odd .",
    "moreover , by the real analytic inverse function theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.5.3 ) ) , @xmath109 is analytic on @xmath105 and hence has a series expansion about @xmath117 , as in eq .  .",
    "in order to analyze this series , we use a known formula for the coefficients of an inverse function ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * eq .  ( 4.5.12 ) ) ) : @xmath118 where the sum runs over nonnegative integers satisfying @xmath119 .",
    "since in our case every term in the sum is nonnegative , it follows that @xmath120 for all @xmath14 , as required .",
