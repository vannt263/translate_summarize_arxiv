    "in 1864 james clerk maxwell initiated a combinatorial trend in the rigidity theory of finite bar - joint frameworks in euclidean space . in two dimensions this amounted to the observation that the underlying structure graph @xmath10 must satisfy the simple counting rule @xmath11 . for minimal rigidity ,",
    "in which any bar removal renders the framework flexible , equality must hold together with the inequalities @xmath12 for subgraphs @xmath13 with at least two vertices .",
    "the fundamental result that these two necessary conditions are also sufficient for the minimal rigidity of a generic framework was obtained by laman in 1970 and this has given impetus to the development of matroid theory techniques . while corresponding counting rules are necessary in three dimensions they fail to be sufficient and a purely combinatorial characterisation of generic rigidity is not available . on the other hand",
    "many specific families of finite graphs are known to be generically rigid , such as the edge graphs of triangular - faced convex polyhedra in three dimensions and the graphs associated with finite triangulations of general surfaces .",
    "see , for example , alexandrov @xcite , fogelsanger @xcite , gluck @xcite , kann @xcite and whiteley @xcite .",
    "a finite simple graph @xmath14 is said to be generically @xmath15-rigid , or simply @xmath15-rigid , if its realisation as some generic bar - joint framework in the euclidean space @xmath8 is infinitesimally rigid . here _ generic _ refers to the algebraic independence of the set of coordinates of the vertices and infinitesimal rigidity in this case is equivalent to continuous ( nontrivial finite motion ) rigidity ( asimow and roth @xcite ) .",
    "the rigidity analysis of bar - joint frameworks and related frameworks , such as body - bar frameworks and body - hinge frameworks , continues to be a focus of investigation , both in the generic case and in the presence of symmetry .",
    "for example katoh and tanigawa @xcite have resolved the molecular conjecture for generic structures , while schulze @xcite has obtained variants of laman s theorem for semi - generic symmetric bar - joint frameworks . in the case of infinite frameworks",
    "however developments have centred mainly on periodic frameworks and the infinitesimal and finite motions which retain some form of periodicity .",
    "indeed , periodicity hypotheses lead to configuration spaces that are real algebraic varieties and so to methods from multi - linear algebra and finite combinatorics .",
    "see , for example , borcea and streinu @xcite , connelly et al .",
    "@xcite , malestein and theran @xcite , owen and power @xcite and ross , schulze and whiteley @xcite . periodic rigidity , broadly interpreted , is also significant in a range of applied settings , such as the mathematical analysis of rigid unit modes in crystals , as indicated in power @xcite and wegner @xcite , for example .    in the development below",
    "we consider general countable simple graphs and the flexibility and rigidity of their placements in the euclidean spaces @xmath8 and in the non - euclidean spaces @xmath16 for the classical @xmath17 norms , for @xmath18 .",
    "also we consider several forms of rigidity , namely ( absolute ) infinitesimal rigidity , infinitesimal rigidity for continuous velocity fields , and , perhaps the most intriguing , rigidity with respect to continuous time - parametrised flexes ( finite flexes ) .",
    "the constraint conditions for the non - euclidean norms are no longer given by polynomial equations and we adapt the asimow - roth notion of a regular framework to obtain the appropriate notion of a generic framework .",
    "this strand of non - euclidean rigidity theory for finite frameworks was begun in kitson and power @xcite and here we develop this in parallel with the usual euclidean perspective .    in theorem [ infinitelaman2 ] we obtain generalisations of laman s theorem in the form of a characterisation of the simple countable graphs which are generically rigid in two dimensional spaces . in theorem [ t :",
    "inductive ] we obtain inductive henneberg move style constructions for the minimally infinitesimally rigid graphs ( isostatic graphs ) in two dimensions . in the euclidean case",
    "this entails that the minimally @xmath19-rigid graphs @xmath14 are those that can be given as the limit of a construction chain @xmath20 where each of the moves @xmath21 is one of the two usual henneberg moves for the plane .",
    "we also see that the infinitesimally rigid countable simple graphs that are infinitesimally rigid for two dimensions are necessarily sequentially rigid in the sense that @xmath14 contains a spanning subgraph which is a union of finite graphs , each of which is infinitesimally rigid .",
    "this is the strongest form of infinitesimal rigidity and the corresponding equivalence fails in higher dimensions .",
    "the inductive characterisations in two dimensions for the norms @xmath22 require the rigidity matroid associated with the sparsity count @xmath23 and additional construction moves .",
    "a countable graph is infinitesimally rigid in this case if and only if it is inductively constructible from @xmath24 through an infinite sequence of @xmath25 types of moves , namely , the henneberg vertex and edge moves , the vertex - to-@xmath26 move , the vertex - to-@xmath27-cycle move , and edge additions .    the results above rest in part on a general characterisation of infinitesimal rigidity in terms of what we refer to as the _ relative rigidity _ of a finite graph @xmath28 with respect to a containing finite graph @xmath29 .",
    "specifically , in all dimensions we show that a countable simple graph @xmath14 is infinitesimally rigid if and only if there is a subgraph inclusion tower @xmath30 which is vertex spanning and in which for each @xmath31 the graph @xmath32 is relatively infinitesimally rigid in @xmath33 ( theorem [ t : ir ] ) .",
    "this principle is useful for determining the rigidity of infinite generic structures in a variety of other contexts and we show here that tay s multi - graph characterisation of the rigidity of generic finite body - bar frameworks in @xmath4 , for all @xmath1 , can be generalised to the countably infinite setting . also we obtain a similar infinite multi - graph characterisation of rigidity for the countably infinite body - bar frameworks in non - euclidean spaces , for @xmath34 .    it is natural to determine variants of cauchy s celebrated infinitesimal rigidity theorem for simplicial polytopes in @xmath35 .",
    "we see that a finite simplicial generic polytope in a non - euclidean space is infinitesimally flexible but becomes isostatic after the addition of three internal nonincident shafts .",
    "we also define a family of infinitely - faceted strictly convex compact polytopes in @xmath35 and the countable graphs defined by their edges . in the simplicial case",
    "such polytopes are associated with triangulations of a finitely punctured @xmath19-sphere and we characterise the @xmath36-rigid graphs of this type .    in the final section we consider rigidity relative to continuous motions and give a non - euclidean variant of the asimow - roth theorem on the equivalence of infinitesimal and continuous rigidity for finite frameworks .",
    "countable graphs can have both continuously flexible generic realisations and continuously rigid generic realisations , and the analysis of continuous rigidity presents new challenges , even for crystallographic frameworks .",
    "we show here that every simplicial polytope graph admits continuously rigid placements ( theorem [ infinitepolytoperigid ] ) and we see that a countable bar - joint framework may be both infinitesimally rigid and continuously flexible ( example [ infrigctsflx ] ) .",
    "in this section we review the necessary background information on the rigidity of finite graphs in @xmath37 with respect to the euclidean norm and the non - euclidean @xmath17 norms . for further details of the euclidean context",

    "in fact one can construct a placement @xmath844 which admits a flex for which the velocities @xmath845 realise an arbitrary sequence of speeds .",
    "that is , given positive speeds @xmath846 there is a placement and an infinitesimal flex @xmath295 with @xmath847 for @xmath840 and @xmath841 otherwise .      * whirlpool frameworks .",
    "* let @xmath14 be the countable graph suggested by figure [ whirlpool ] .",
    "we define a _ whirlpool framework _ to be one that arises from a planar placement of @xmath14 with a single ( finite ) accumulation point for the ( distinct ) vertex placements .",
    "note that the addition of any edge to @xmath14 gives a countable minimally @xmath19-rigid graph and so @xmath848 . if @xmath39 is a generic whirlpool framework then @xmath849 and every nontrivial infinitesimal flex is uniquely associated with a nontrivial flex of the outer rectangular subframework .",
    "such flexes @xmath850 are determined by the rigidity matrix @xmath851 and this calculation can be made explicit in the presence of symmetry .",
    "we now show this for the affinely periodic placement indicated in figure [ whirlpool ] .",
    "the finite framework @xmath856 supported by the first eight vertices has a finite structure graph with edges @xmath857 for the pairs @xmath858 the rigidity matrix @xmath859 has the form @xmath860\\ ] ] where @xmath861\\]]and @xmath862\\ ] ] are the rigidity matrices for the outer and inner square frameworks , and @xmath863\\ ] ] note that @xmath864 is an infinitesimal flex of the outer square , with half turn symmetry .",
    "let @xmath865 so that @xmath866 is a velocity vector for the @xmath867-vertex subframework . solving the linear system @xmath868 for @xmath869 leads to an infinitesimal flex and taking @xmath869 with half - turn symmetry reduces this calculation to one with @xmath27 rather than @xmath867 indeterminates .",
    "we have @xmath870 also this infinitesimal flex of the inner square has the same form as that for the outer square in that its velocities are directed along the diagonal directions of the square .",
    "in particular , the infinitesimal flex @xmath871 of the infinite whirlpool framework is now determined by the affine symmetry .",
    "since @xmath872 we have @xmath850 with @xmath873 as @xmath874 . since the framework is generic with flexibility dimension @xmath875 it follows that this divergence property holds for any nontrivial infinitesimal flex .",
    "thus @xmath39 is infinitesimally rigid for continuous velocity fields .",
    "if a continuous flex of a finite bar - joint framework is differentiable then the derivative at @xmath827 is an infinitesimal flex .",
    "the same assertion therefore holds for infinite frameworks .",
    "thus we conclude immediately that the whirlpool framework does not admit a continuous flex that is smooth in the sense of being the restriction of a differentiable velocity field on @xmath876 .",
    "in fact one can show that @xmath39 is continuously rigid .",
    "note that a whirlpool placement @xmath877 which is fully symmetric , with symmetry group of the square , has @xmath878 since each square @xmath27-cycle subframework supports an infinitesimal rotation flex .",
    "in this case @xmath877 is not infinitesimally rigid for continuous velocity fields .",
    "the continuous motion of a translationally periodic strip framework can be quite chaotic .",
    "one way to make this precise is first to recall a theorem of kempe @xcite to the effect that an arbitrary algebraic finite curve in the plane can be `` drawn '' by a finite mechanism .",
    "that is , the curve agrees with the trace of a joint in a ( standardized ) flex of uniquely continuously flexible finite bar - joint framework .",
    "in particular one can realise a chaotic logistic map @xmath879 by a mechanism @xmath880 where @xmath58 and @xmath881 are angle changes .",
    "figure [ f : periodicmechanism ] indicates a periodic mechanism built from such a finite mechanism in which the angular deviation @xmath58 from the vertical position at @xmath882 induces an angular deviation @xmath881 at @xmath883 .",
    "the deviation induced by the increase of @xmath58 from @xmath564 to @xmath884 at the @xmath885 repeat , is @xmath886 ( @xmath406 compositions ) .",
    "it follows in particular that the sequence of speeds of the placed vertices at any positive time is an unbounded sequence .",
    "the same unbounded speeds property holds for the two - way infinite version of the strip framework of figure [ f : infrig ] .",
    "however this framework does not exhibit chaotic continuous motion .",
    "in fact there are two translationally periodic positions that may occur in any continuous flex ( which fixes the base framework ) namely the initial placement ( given in figure [ f : infrig ] ) and the periodic position in which all inclination angles are at the fixed point value for the propagation function @xmath822 .",
    "for all other positions the inclination angles tend to @xmath564 to the left , while to the right the inclination angles tend towards the positive fixed point angle in an oscillatory fashion .",
    "we also remark that there is a countable bar - joint framework variant of kempe s theorem for the trace realisation of any finite continuous curve @xmath887 ( owen and power @xcite ) . in these realisations",
    "there are a small number of vertices of countable degree .",
    "it follows that with an appropriate infinite black box mechanism one may in principle construct countable graphs with periodic placements with diverse chaotic motion .",
    "it also follows from such elaborate constructions that there exist countable graphs with generic placements which are mechanisms ( uniquely continuously flexible frameworks ) whose motion is nowhere differentiable .        for a general dimension @xmath15 and sufficiently large finite graph @xmath14 with placement @xmath39 write @xmath888 for the normalised variety of equivalent frameworks @xmath877 with the property that a specific set of @xmath889 coordinates of @xmath45 agree with the corresponding set for @xmath78",
    "this might be considered as the variety of standard placements equivalent to @xmath45 .",
    "thus , for generic @xmath45 the set @xmath888 is finite if and only if @xmath14 is @xmath15-rigid .",
    "also , for a sufficiently small open ball @xmath890 the intersection @xmath891 is a manifold .",
    "it is also convenient to write @xmath892 for the connected component in @xmath888 which contains @xmath45 .",

    "suppose that for sufficiently small @xmath778 the diameter of @xmath896 tends to zero as @xmath874 for each @xmath897 .",
    "then @xmath39 is continuously rigid .    if @xmath39 is continuously flexible then there is a continuous flex taking values in @xmath892 which is not constant on @xmath898 for some index @xmath899 .",
    "moreover the sets @xmath900 , for all @xmath894 contain the range of the restriction of the flex to @xmath898 . in view of the assumptions",
    "this is a contradiction for sufficiently large @xmath31 .",
    "the next lemma concerns the approximate rigidity of what might be referred to as the _ slack placements _ of a finite graph . in such placements",
    "a number of edge incidence conditions are relaxed to proximity conditions . in the case of incidence relaxation at a single vertex @xmath493 the vertex @xmath493 is removed but not the edges incident to it .",

    "figure [ gk_sequence ] indicates the relatedness of placements in @xmath35 of the graphs @xmath935 and @xmath936 in the case @xmath937 .",
    "we proceed by making progressive placements of the graphs @xmath32 . for the placement of @xmath29 following the placement of @xmath28 we make use of a temporary placement of the @xmath36-rigid multi - graph @xmath941 as a guide . in this step , which also provides the argument for subsequent placements , the placement of @xmath28 is extended to a placement of @xmath29 so that the diameter of the projection to @xmath28 coordinates of the standardised variety of @xmath29 has diameter less than @xmath942    let @xmath695 .",
    "place @xmath28 generically on the unit sphere to create @xmath943 .",
    "since @xmath936 is a simplicial graph of connectivity zero with possibly some edges repeated there is an extended generic placement @xmath944 of @xmath936 on the unit sphere which is continuously rigid . by lemma [ l : wdelta ]",

    "generic placements do not play a significant role in the argument above since the guiding placements of the @xmath36-rigid simplicial polyhedral graphs @xmath398 will be continuously rigid when given a convex placement .",
    "in particular it follows that the polytope frameworks in examples [ eg : diamond ] and [ polytopeframeworks ] have latitude specifications which give continuously rigid placements .",
