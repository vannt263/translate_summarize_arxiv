    "various proposals have been made for strongly correlated electron analogues@xcite of topological band insulators .",
    "to date the best candidate strongly correlated topological insulator is smb@xmath1 , a local moment metal which transforms into a kondo insulator , once the moments screen at low temperatures ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "this material was first predicted to be a topological kondo insulator @xcite and recently shown to exhibit conducting in - gap surface states , which develop below @xmath3k @xcite . while these results are consistent with a topological kondo insulator , a definitive observation of dirac cone excitations with polarized quasiparticles",
    "has not yet been reported .",
    "however , tentative data of the dirac cone surface states have become available in both quantum oscillation @xcite and arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "one of the unexpected features of these measurements is the presence of `` light '' , high - velocity surface quasiparticles , with the dirac point far outside the gap .",
    "these tentative results are puzzling , because their group velocities appear 10 to 100 times larger than that expected in a heavy fermion band @xcite .",
    "these results provide motivation for the current paper . here",
    "we introduce a simple one dimensional `` p - wave kondo lattice '' which gives rise to a topological kondo insulator that can be studied by a variety of methods . in this initial study",
    "we carry out the simplest mean - field treatment of our model , an approach which is technically exact in the large @xmath0 limit , using it to gain insight into the nature of the edge states and to propose variational ground - states for the model .",
    "this work is also an important warm - up exercise for a three dimensional model .",

    "each localized moment is coupled to the conduction sea via a kondo `` cotunneling '' term that exchanges spin between a localized moment at site @xmath4 and a p - wave combination of conduction electron states formed between neighboring sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 . ]    .",
    "[ fig : fig_model ]    a second goal of this work is to gain insight into the the impact of the boundary on the kondo effect , a phenomenon we refer to as `` kondo band bending '' . in the conventional kondo insulator model ,",
    "the hybridization between local moments and conduction electrons is local and the strong - coupling ground state involves a kondo singlet at every site , with minimal boundary effects . in the case of non - trivial topology",
    "the kondo singlets are non - local objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_model ] ) which are partially broken at the boundary .",
    "we seek to understand how this influences the kondo effect and the character of the edge states at the boundary .",
    "our model describes conduction electron fluid interacting with an antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain via a kondo co - tunneling term with p - wave character .",

    "the chemical potential of the conduction electrons has been set to zero , corresponding to a half - filled conduction band .",
    "in contrast to the conventional s - wave kondo model , the kondo effect is non - local . in particular , the electron wannier states that couple to the local moment have p - wave symmetry @xmath13 the kondo coupling now permits the process of `` co - tunneling '' whereby an electron can hop across a spin as it flips it .",
    "the odd - parity co - tunneling terms are a consequence of the underlying hybridization with localized p - wave orbitals .",
    "when this hybridization is eliminated via a schrieffer - wolff transformation , the resulting kondo interaction contains an odd - parity form factor .",
    "the boundary spins have a lower connectivity , giving rise to a lower kondo temperature which tends to localize them into a magnetic state . to examine these effects in greater detail , we take the kondo coupling @xmath14 to be uniform in the bulk , but to have strength @xmath15 at the boundary , @xmath16 ) . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] by allowing the end couplings to be enhanced by a factor @xmath17 we can crudely compensate for the localizing effect of the reduced boundary connectivity .",
    "in real 3d kondo insulators , this surface enhancement effect ( `` kondo band - bending '' ) would occur in response to changes in the valence of the magnetic ions near the surface . for sm and yb kondo insulators ,",
    "the valence of the surface ions is expected to shift to a more mixed valent configuration , enhancing @xmath17 , while in ce kondo insulators , the opposite effect is expected .    to formulate the model as a canonical field theory , we rewrite the spin @xmath18 using abrikosov pseudo - fermions @xmath19 , as @xmath20 with the associated `` gutzwiller '' constraint @xmath21 at each site . after applying the completeness relations for the pauli matrices in ( [ h_k ] ) we obtain the coqblin - schrieffer form of the kondo interaction , @xmath22 where we have imposed the constraint . in an analogous fashion ,",

    "<S> to gain further insight into the properties of interacting topological insulators , we study a 1 dimensional model of topological kondo insulators which can be regarded as the strongly interacting limit of the tamm - shockley model . treating the model in a large @xmath0 expansion </S>",
    "<S> , we find a number of competing ground - state solutions , including topological insulating and valence bond ground - states . </S>",
    "<S> one of the effects to emerge in our treatment is a reconstruction of the kondo screening process near the boundary of the material ( `` kondo band bending '' ) . near the boundary for localization into a valence bond state , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the conduction character of the edge state grows substantially , leading to states that extend deeply into bulk . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that such states are the one - dimensional analog of the light f - electron surface states which appear to develop in the putative topological kondo insulator , smb@xmath1 . </S>"
