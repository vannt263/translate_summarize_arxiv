    "the cosmic ray energy spectrum , in the high energy region above @xmath1 ev , presents two main features observed by several experiments , the second knee , observed at @xmath2 ev @xcite and the ankle .",
    "there is evidence of a fourth feature situated at the highest observed energies , consistent with the so - called gzk suppression @xcite , which would be caused by the interaction of the ultra - high energy protons with the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite . for the case of heavier nuclei",
    "a similar effect is expected because of their interaction with photons from the infrared and microwave backgrounds @xcite .",
    "the origin of the second knee is still unclear .",
    "it has been interpreted as the end of the efficiency of the acceleration in galactic supernova remnant shock waves @xcite , a change in the diffusion regime in our galaxy @xcite or even the transition between the galactic and extragalactic components of the cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the ankle is a broader feature .",
    "it has been observed by fly s eye @xcite , haverah park @xcite , yakutsk @xcite , hires @xcite and auger @xcite in hybrid mode at approximately the same energy , @xmath3 ev . the origin of the ankle is also unknown . it can be interpreted as the transition between the galactic and extragalactic components @xcite or the result of pair production by extragalactic protons after the interaction with photons of the cmbr during propagation @xcite .",
    "there are three main models of the galactic - extragalactic transition .",
    "the first is the mixed composition model @xcite , in which extragalactic sources inject a spectrum of masses similar to lower energy galactic cosmic rays and for which the transition takes place at the ankle .",
    "the second is the ankle model @xcite , a two - component transition from galactic iron nuclei to extragalactic protons at the ankle energy .",
    "the third is the dip model @xcite , in which the ankle is due to pair production of extragalactic protons that interact with the photons of the cmbr ( in this scenario the transition occurs at the second knee ) .    in order to rule out or substantiate any of those models ,",
    "additional information is necessary besides the energy spectrum shape and absolute intensity .",
    "detailed measurements of the composition as a function of energy , while not sufficient , would be extremely valuable to break the present degeneracy among competing models for the galactic - extragalactic transition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this kind of information could help to determine what the highest energy accelerators in the galaxy are and provide indicators of the kind and level of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence present in the intergalactic medium traversed by the lowest energy cosmic ray particles @xcite .",
    "several experiments have measured the cosmic ray composition in the region where the transition takes place .",
    "nevertheless , large discrepancies exist between different experiments and experimental techniques @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons behind the plurality of sometimes contradicting results is that composition is determined by comparing experimental data with numerical shower simulations .",
    "these simulations include models for the relevant hadronic interactions which are extrapolations , over several orders of magnitude in center of mass , of accelerator data to cosmic ray energies .",
    "this is a source of considerable uncertainty which is confirmed , to a certain extent , by the fact that there is experimental evidence of a deficit in muon content of simulated showers with respect to real data @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new statistical method to test the compatibility of the high energy hadronic interaction models and real data .",
    "in fact , the hadronic interaction model is assumed to be the main systematic uncertainty in the present analysis . throughout our analysis",
    ", we consider qgsjet - ii @xcite and sibyll 2.1 @xcite .",
    "our method allows us to verify whether the experimental data are compatible with the hadronic models under consideration and , if so , to estimate the composition .",
    "although this new technique is of general applicability , we study its potential in the context of amiga ( auger muons and infill for the ground array ) @xcite and heat ( high elevation auger telescopes ) @xcite , the lower energy extensions of the southern pierre auger observatory .",
    "these two enhancements will extend the energy range down to @xmath1 ev , encompassing the second knee and ankle region where the galactic - extragalactic transition takes place .",
    "the most relevant mass sensitive parameters that will be obtained from amiga and heat are the number of muons at 600 m from the shower core , @xmath4 , and the atmospheric depth of maximum shower development , @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "consequently , we develop our statistical technique by using mainly this pair of parameters .",
    "combinations of @xmath4 with parameters from the cherenkov detectors like the slope of the lateral distribution function , rise - time of the signals and curvature radius are also studied .",
    "note that our technique should also be applicable to telescope array and its low energy extension @xcite , which have hybrid capabilities in the region of the ankle and also plan to include muon detectors @xcite .",
    "the quoted expected error for @xmath5 is @xmath6 g @xmath7 @xcite , which is comparable to the value estimated for heat .",
    "@xmath4 is nearly linearly dependent on energy ; therefore , its use as a composition estimator requires , ideally , an independent determination of the shower energy .",
    "this is not a problem in the case of the auger enhancements , where the same strategy of energy calibration as with the baseline design can be used .",
    "hybrid events from the amiga - heat detector provide a calibration for @xmath8 , the lateral distribution function value at a fixed distance @xmath9 m , as measured by the amiga surface array of water cherenkov detectors .",
    "the same procedure should be , in principle , applicable to other detectors with hybrid capability like telescope array .",
    "this is so because @xmath4 and energy are correlated through @xmath10 and the latter also receives an important contribution from the electromagnetic lateral distribution function , while @xmath4 is directly used as a composition parameter .",
    "therefore , at energies of few @xmath11 ev or smaller , under the assumption of a binary mixture of proton and iron , the separation in @xmath4 due to composition alone at fixed energy is larger than the separation in @xmath10 due to composition at the same energy .",
    "this can be clearly seen , for example , in figures 12.a and 12.b of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the merit factors ( or discrimination power ) for different composition indicators are shown as a function of energy for two zenith angles .",
    "the merit factor is , basically , the separation between the distribution functions of each parameter at a given energy normalized by the combined dispersion of both distributions .",
    "it can be seen that , at a fixed energy , the separation between the distributions of @xmath4 for proton and iron , the main composition indicator , is much larger than the separation between the corresponding distributions of @xmath10 , the energy estimator .",
    "consequently , the fact that @xmath4 is correlated simultaneously to energy and composition does not inhibit its use as a composition parameter .",
    "section [ compodet ] shows our main results .",
    "in particular , it is shown there that , by working on a plane defined by two parameters derived from @xmath5 and @xmath12 data , an estimation of the cosmic ray composition can be obtained that is reasonably independent of the uncertainties related to the underlying hadronic interaction model .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that rather small samples of events at a given reconstructed energy , compatible with the level of statistic expected from detectors currently under construction that will operate in the ankle region , are enough to this end . additionally to the determination of composition , given two possible interaction models and an observed data set ,",
    "the technique can be used to assess the compatibility of these models with the experimental data .",
    "in order to develop a statistical method to infer the composition of the cosmic rays ( i.e. the abundance of a given primary type ) , let us consider two possible types of primaries , @xmath13 , and samples of size @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the number of events corresponding to type @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . from each event of an individual sample it is possible to extract several observable parameters sensitive to the primary mass .",

    "<S> in this paper we introduce a new multiparametric technique that attempts to tackle simultaneously the problems of composition determination and hadronic interaction uncertainty . employing simulations of a real world detector under its planned operational conditions , and disregarding systematics , we can asses that the present technique should be able to determine the composition of a binary mixture of p and fe with a statistical confidence of few percent , in a way that is independent of the assumed hadronic interaction model . moreover </S>",
