    "statistical thermal models are widely used in the analysis of relativistic heavy ion collisions ( see e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) . in these models , the final stage of inelastic interactions between hadrons , the _ chemical freeze - out",
    "_ , is characterized by the parameters of stationary maximum entropy ensemble .    for large system",
    ", it is appropriate to choose the most straightforwardly applicable ensemble , the grand canonical ( gc ) one , which is parametrized by temperature @xmath0 and chemical potential @xmath1 for each averagely conserved charge @xmath2 .",
    "the gc ensemble is defined in the large volume limit , so the volume parameter @xmath3 is an extensive coefficient in the expressions for such quantities as mean particle numbers . for small systems , such as pp or pa reactions ,",
    "the charge conservation laws must be handled exactly , so the ensemble to be chosen is the canonical ( c ) one .",
    "then , the @xmath3 independent fugacities due to average conservation laws do not appear , but are replaced by _",
    "nonlinearly @xmath3 dependent _ canonical chemical factors , which can account for many enhancement patterns going from pp to pa to aa systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we quote the newly developed computational method for relativistic @xmath4 canonical hadron ensemble , which enables us to reach previously unattainable canonical model results , up to baryon number @xmath5 whereas with old methods it was only possible to reach @xmath6 @xcite with very long computation times .",
    "once this is achieved , we can give an answer to question whether the full @xmath4 canonical modelling is needed , or is the @xmath7 canonical ( @xmath8 grand canonical ) or gc approximation accurate enough .",
    "in order to pass from the usual grand - canonical partition function @xmath9 to the one fulfilling exact internal symmetries , we employ a well - known group theoretical method , first introduced by cerulus @xcite . by denoting the set of conserved quantum numbers by @xmath10 ,",
    "the canonical partition function @xmath11 can be obtained by using a projecting operator onto the conserved quantum numbers . in the case of @xmath12 internal symmetries of type @xmath13",
    ", the projection takes the form : @xmath14           z_{gc}(t , v,\\{\\lambda_{c_i}\\ } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : projection}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a @xmath13 group parameter and a wick - rotated fugacity factor @xmath16 is introduced , for every charge @xmath17 .    in heavy ion reactions ,",
    "the relevant set of conserved charges is @xmath18 , namely baryon number , strangeness and electric charge .",
    "applying this set to the previous equation yields a triple integral , which is computationally extremely time consuming for @xmath19 .",
    "in @xcite we have eliminated analytically the baryon integration , and have obtained a very efficient way to calculate the full canonical ( @xmath4 ) hadron thermodynamics .",
    "the applied form of partition function reads : @xmath20 , \\label{partt}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the partition function for hadrons carrying no relevant charge and @xmath22 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the sum is over mesons , and @xmath23 is the one - particle partition function . the @xmath24 above is defined as @xmath25 , where the summation runs over baryons but not antibaryons .",
    "now , we are left with a double integration only which can be then performed numerically with no major problem .",
    "the mean particle numbers of primary hadrons ( i.e. those directly emitted from the hadronizing source ) @xmath26 are obtained from the equation  ( [ partt ] ) @xcite by taking the derivative of the canonical partition function with respect to a fictitious fugacity @xmath27 : @xmath28 where the quantity @xmath29 is called _ chemical factor _ @xcite . in the large volume ( thermodynamical ) limit , this expression becomes the gc one , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "in this paper , we perform no actual fitting procedure to the experimental data , but only use some suggestive thermal parameter values from our previous work @xcite .",
    "this is because our main motivation is to show systematically the canonical effects in different systems in order to give the reader an insight on applicability of different thermal approaches , namely full canonical , strangeness canonical and grand canonical .    in the following ,",
    "we fix the temperature and baryon density in several cases .",
    "strangeness and charge to baryons ratio are fixed according to initial nuclear composition .",
    "these conditions lead to fixed fugacities and particle ratios in gc formalism .",
    "gc approximations are then to be compared with full canonical and @xmath7-canonical counterparts , which are nonlinearly dependent on net baryon content .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the canonical kaon enhancement in the conditions relevant to gsi energies , 1.7 gev per nucleon in sis auau collisions .",
    "the theoretical production ratio k@xmath31 over number of participating nucleons is shown to point out the canonical strangeness effect .",
    "note that we have been able to compute the full chemical factor even for @xmath32 .",
    "the ratio increases very slowly towards the gc limit , thus strangeness must always be handled canonically when analysing sis results .",
    "the relative difference between full canonical and strangeness - canonical results is 13% for @xmath33 , decreasing to 4% for @xmath34 and to 1% for @xmath35 .",
    "it must be pointed out that the above results are calculated using an isospin symmetric initial configuration whereas @xmath36 for gold nucleus . however",
    ", this variation essentially gives no change on the relative differences above , although the ratio k@xmath37 decreases naturally due to the initial neutron excess .",
    "au collisions at ags energies ( 11.6 @xmath38 gev momentum ) , the chemical freeze - out temperature is found to be around @xmath39 mev and the baryon density close to the normal nuclear density @xcite . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we plot the calculated k@xmath37 with results obtained in peripheral to central au ",
    "au , si  au and si  al collisions .",
    "it can be seen that all the way up from @xmath33 to @xmath40 the full canonical and strangeness - canonical results are essentially the same .",
    "all central reaction results lie on the region where the canonical effects are negligible and the gc formalism applies .",
    "strangeness enhancement in au ",
    "au system does not definitely look like being of canonical origin , whereas si ",
    "au and si  al follow roughly the curve at the normal nuclear density ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the above argument also applies for the k@xmath41 enhancement pattern @xcite .    the best fit temperature for the multiplicities measured by na49 experiment at sps in central pb  pb reactions at 158 @xmath38 gev is found to be @xmath42 mev @xcite . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we show the strange baryon enhancement by using a baryon density 0.3 @xmath43 .",
    "although the baryon density in our analysis @xcite was found to be @xmath44 @xmath43 this larger value is used in order to probe the largest reasonable canonical effect .",
    "all results in figure [ fig6 ] are normalized to the baryon multiplicities per participant at the point @xmath45 .",
    "this choice reveals the slight difference between the results obtained using the @xmath7-canonical approximation and the @xmath4-canonical calculation .",
    "an interesting feature here is the fact , that the @xmath7-canonical approximation leads to an overestimation of the canonical effect .",
    "we would like to acknowledge stimulating discussions with esko suhonen , jean cleymans , krzysztof redlich and many other colleagues participating the conference strangeness in quark matter 2001 , and especially the organizers of that pleasant meeting .",
