    "percolation refers to the emergence of a giant cluster during a process where nodes or links are being added . since a global connectivity is one of the key factors for a proper function of a network , the percolation transition has been received much attention in various contexts .",
    "this raises the question regarding the nature of the percolation transition in different applications .",
    "the nature depends on whether nodes or links are added in a random or strategic way  @xcite , whether underlying networks are correlated or uncorrelated  @xcite , and whether they are static or growing  @xcite .",
    "one of the applications where the percolation plays an important role is the susceptible - infected - removed  ( sir ) model on complex networks  @xcite .",
    "the sir model describes an epidemic spreading among individuals which are in a susceptible , infected , or removed state .",
    "an infected individual infects a neighboring susceptible one or recovers acquiring immunity .",
    "suppose that one individual is infected while the others are in the susceptible state initially .",
    "then , after a transient period , the system ends up with a state consisting of susceptible and removed individuals .",
    "the cluster of removed individuals thus obtained is equivalent to a bond percolation cluster  @xcite .",
    "hence the epidemic transition is characterized by the percolation transition .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the percolation threshold and the critical behavior of a degree - ordered percolation  ( dop ) in which nodes are occupied in the descending order of their degree .",
    "higher degree nodes are occupied first .",
    "the dop was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to resolve a controversy concerning the epidemic threshold for an infection rate @xmath3 of the susceptible - infected - susceptible  ( sis ) model .",
    "in contrast to the sir model , infected individuals become susceptible again after recovering .",
    "thus , the sis model does not correspond to an ordinary percolation model .",
    "the sis model was studied in the framework of the heterogeneous mean - field  ( hmf ) theory in which node connectivity was treated in an annealed way  @xcite .",
    "it predicts a threshold @xmath4 as a function of cumulants of the degree , which may be zero or nonzero depending on the degree distribution .",
    "later on , a more refined quenched mean - field  ( qmf ) theory was proposed , in which node connectivity was treated in a quenched way  @xcite .",
    "the qmf yields that the density @xmath5 of infected nodes becomes nonzero at @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the highest degree among all nodes .",
    "it leads researchers to conclude that the epidemic threshold vanishes in any networks where the maximum degree diverges in the infinite - size limit  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion might be true if @xmath5 would remain finite in the infinite - size limit for @xmath8 .",
    "however , it was found that the infection of the qmf theory can be localized around the hub with the maximum degree for a finite @xmath3 larger than @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the localization property was more elaborated in ref .",
    "as @xmath3 increases , more localized infections appear around nodes whose degree @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 .",
    "localized infections are finite - sized , hence decay after a transient period .",
    "the true epidemic transition will take place when the localized infections percolate at @xmath12 .",
    "note that localized infections appear successively around nodes in the degree - descending order .",
    "thus , the dop can provide a valuable information on the epidemic threshold .",
    "it was claimed that a nonzero dop threshold implies a nonzero epidemic threshold  @xcite , which was confirmed numerically in a model network .",
    "the controversy is still under debate  @xcite .",
    "a complex network is vulnerable to a targeted attack to higher degree nodes  @xcite .",
    "the dop deals with the opposite situation where higher degree nodes are preferred .",
    "it is an interesting question whether the preference can make the percolation threshold vanish in complex networks .",
    "furthermore , considering the relevance to the sis model , it is important to establish firmly the percolation threshold and the critical property of the dop in complex networks whose maximum degree diverges in the infinite size limit .",
    "for this reason , we investigate the dop in the @xmath0 flower networks  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 flowers have a hierarchical structure , which allows an analytic approach .",
    "it is best suited for our purpose .",

    "the initial nodes present in @xmath13 and @xmath21 play an important role in characterizing the percolation .",

    "( iv ) the @xmath0 flower is a small - world network with the diameter scaling as @xmath40 for @xmath2 while it is a fractal network with @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "we describe the dop on the @xmath0 flower",
    ". initially all the nodes are unoccupied or empty .",

    "there are multiple candidates , one of them is selected randomly",
    ". this procedure is repeated until the fraction of occupied nodes reaches a prescribed value @xmath43 .",
    "we are interested in the percolating probability denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "it is defined as the probability that the two roots of @xmath15 are connected via occupied nodes .",
    "one needs to treat the cases with @xmath2 and @xmath42 separately .",
    "when @xmath2 , the roots are connected via a single link in all generations .",
    "thus , the system is percolating if the two roots are occupied .",
    "this implies that @xmath45 for @xmath46 , so the percolation threshold vanishes in the infinite - size limit .    when @xmath42 , any path connecting the two roots includes nodes with the minimum degree @xmath47  [ see fig .  [ fig1 ] ]",
    ". consequently , all nodes with @xmath48 should be occupied necessarily for percolation .",
    "remaining nodes have the same degree @xmath47 , so they are occupied randomly .",
    "hence , the dop in the @xmath0 flowers with @xmath42 is equivalent to the ordinary random node percolation starting from the correlated initial condition in which all nodes with @xmath48 are occupied .",
    "let @xmath49 be the occupation probability of nodes with @xmath47 .",

    "note that the hubs of an ascendent  ( @xmath15 ) is the roots of the descendents  ( @xmath54 ) .",
