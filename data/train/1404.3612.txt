    "inflation @xcite that solves a number of cosmological conundrums , such as the horizon , monopole , entropy problems is now a crucial part of the history of our universe . within a simplest inflation model ,",
    "a field called inflaton plays a important role during the early time of the universe , which not only drives the universe to nearly exponentially expand , but also generates small fluctuations that is very important for large - scale structure formation in later time .",
    "inflation may be never end , which we call the eternal inflation @xcite . from observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , like the satellite - based wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and _ planck _ @xcite experiments",
    ", we can obtain lots of informations about the early universe .",
    "one of them is the power spectra of the perturbations .",
    "the observed cmb temperature fluctuations mainly generated by scalar perturbations already have constrain many inflation models , but there are still many left , which are all consistent with observations .",
    "large number of current cmb experiment efforts now target b-_mode _ polarization , which could be only generated by tensor perturbations .",
    "recently , a ground - based `` background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization '' experiment has reported their results ( bicep2 ) .",
    "they have shown that the observed b-_mode _ power spectrum at certain angular scales is well fitted by a lensed-@xmath4cdm + tensor theoretical model with tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is disfavoured at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "on the other side , general relativity might break down due to the very high energies during inflation , and as a candidate for the theory of everything , string theory should tell us what is a successful theory of the cosmology at that time , and some corrections from string theory might be needed . in the non - perturbative string / m theory ,",
    "any physical process at the very short distance take an uncertainty relation , called the stringy space - time uncertainty relation ( ssur ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the string length scale , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the uncertainties in the physical time and space coordinates .",
    "the ssur may be a universal relation for strings and d - branes @xcite .",
    "brandenberger and ho @xcite have proposed a variation of space - time noncommutative field theory to realize the stringy space - time uncertainty relation without breaking any of the global symmetries of the homogeneous isotropic universe .",
    "if inflation is affected by physics at a scale close to string scale , one expects that space - time uncertainty must leave vestiges in the cmb power spectrum@xcite .",
    "recently , feng _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite propose a new power - law inflation model , by choosing a different @xmath12 functions ( shall be defined below ) , which are equivalent to that proposed by brandenberger and ho @xcite by the means of integration .",
    "but it is much more clear to see the effect of noncommutative space - time and much easier to deal with the perturbation functions . for detail calculations and discussions on it ,",
    "see the appendix  a in ref.@xcite .    it has been shown that a large class of non - quadratic scalar kinetic terms can derive an inflationary evolution without the help of potential term , usually referred to as k - inflation @xcite , e.g. the tachyon @xcite and the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) inflation @xcite . in this paper , we shall study the k - inflation model in the noncommutative space - time following the method in ref.@xcite . a linear contribution to the power spectra of the scalar and tensor perturbations",
    "is given in this model .",
    "we also confront two specific k - inflation models , namely the tachyon and dbi models , with latest results from the _ planck _ and bicep2 experiments , and we find that the dbi model is not favored , while the tachyon model lies inside the @xmath2 contour , if the e - folds number is assumed to be around @xmath3 . this paper is organized as follows . in next section , we will calculate the power spectra of the k - inflation model in the noncommutative space - time ; in sec.[sec : kinfmodels ] we will constrain the parameters in tachyon and dbi models by using the latest observations . in the last section , we will draw our conclusions and give some discussions .",
    "the general lagrangian for a single field model with second - order field equations is an arbitrary function @xmath13 of the scalar field @xmath14 and its kinetic energy @xmath15 . with the addition of gravity",
    ", the action takes the following form @xmath16\\,,\\ ] ] in the units of @xmath17 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the inflaton reads @xmath18 which is equivalent to a perfect fluid , namely @xmath19 with pressure @xmath20 , energy density @xmath21 and four - velocity @xmath22 . in the following",
    ", we will consider a flat homogeneous and isotropic background model during inflation with the friedmann - robertson - walker metric given by : @xmath23 for a spatially flat universe ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath25 and the ssur relation ( [ equ : ssur ] ) becomes : @xmath26 which is not well defined when @xmath27 is large , because the argument @xmath28 for the scale factor on the r.h.s .",
    "changes over time interval @xmath27 , and it is thus not clear what to use for @xmath29 in eq.([equ : ssur1 ] ) .",
    "the problem is the same when one uses the conformal time @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , for later use , a new time coordinate @xmath32 is introduced as @xmath33 such that the metric becomes @xmath34 and the ssur relation is now well defined : @xmath35 therefore , the friedmann equation becomes @xmath36 and the equation of motion for the inflaton is @xmath37 also we have the relation @xmath38 . as a result of non - trivial kinetic terms in @xmath20 , the dispersion relation for the inflaton",
    "is changed , and the fluctuations in the scalar field is no longer travelling at the speed of light . instead , the sound speed in @xmath14 is given by @xmath39 in the canonical case , @xmath40 with inflaton potential @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 . to use the slow - roll approximation we may define @xmath43 which are small parameters during inflation , i.e. @xmath44 .      the action of the scalar perturbation could be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the total spatial coordinate volume and the prime denotes the derivatives with respect to a new time coordinate @xmath47 defined as @xmath48 here we have defined @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the curvature perturbation and @xmath51 is the so - called `` mukhanov variable '' . here",
    "we have taken a different form of the @xmath12 functions , which is equivalent to that used in the literatures by the mean of integration .",
    "it is now much more easier to deal with the equations of motion for the field @xmath50 : @xmath52 which could be derived from the action ( [ equ : pertaction ] ) . here",

    "the corresponding parameter @xmath1 during inflation at the mode creating time is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the value of hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "since the scale factor is increasing nearly exponentially ( @xmath66 ) or with a large power ( @xmath67 , with a large @xmath68 ) and @xmath65 is almost a constant , the parameter @xmath1 will decrease with time , see eq.([equ : lambda ] ) . at the same time when a mode is created ( [ equ : upbound ] )",
    ", the wave number cross the comoving sound horizon is given by @xmath69 therefore , during inflation , we have @xmath70 in the following , we will focus on the case of @xmath71 , which means all the modes are created inside the horizon ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the other case @xmath73 will not be considered in this paper , since in this case it is hard to explain the flatness of the universe , see ref.@xcite for detail discussions .",
    "thus , during inflation the parameter @xmath74 , and we will treat it as a free small parameter in the model .",
    "all the calculations are taken up to the first order of @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the scalar power spectrum will be calculated at the time when the mode crosses the sound horizon ( @xmath75 ) in our case . by using the approximation , eq.([equ : eom ] )",
