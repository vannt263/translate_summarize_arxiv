    "quantum entanglement and nonlocality  @xcite , which are two special aspects of quantum correlations , are among the central concepts in quantum theory providing powerful resources for modern quantum - information processing  @xcite . nevertheless , despite much progress (",
    "as reviewed in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , our understanding of the relation between entanglement and nonlocality is very incomplete .",
    "quantum nonlocality is often discussed in the context of bell s theorem , which can arguably be considered , , the most profound discovery of science   @xcite . the bell inequality violation ( biv ) for a given state implies that there is no physical theory of local - hidden variables which can reproduce the predictions for the state  @xcite .",
    "although the biv does not necessarily imply nonlocality and vice versa ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , for convenience , we use the terms biv and nonlocality interchangeably .",
    "because of the prominent role of quantum entanglement , much effort has been devoted to investigating measures of entanglement that can be used for its quantification .",
    "currently , a variety of formal and operational entanglement measures can be applied  @xcite depending on the physical and information contexts .",
    "for example , if one is interested in distinguishing entangled from separable states , a convenient choice is the relative entropy of entanglement ( ree )  @xcite .",
    "however , if one considers the cost of entanglement under operations preserving the positivity of partial transpose ( ppt )  @xcite , the appropriate choice of entanglement measure is the ( logarithmic ) negativity  @xcite .",
    "the concurrence  @xcite is yet another popular measure of entanglement , which quantifies the entanglement of formation  @xcite .    for two - qubit pure states , entanglement and nonlocality are equivalent resources as shown by gisin  @xcite .",
    "the interest in comparisons of biv and entanglement was arguably triggered by the discovery of two - qubit entangled mixed states ( now called the werner states ) admitting a hidden - variable model  @xcite .",
    "for mixed states , not only the entanglement and nonlocality become inequivalent phenomena , but even the measures of entanglement become , in general , inequivalent .",
    "for example , two - qubit mixed states of the same value of a given entanglement measure can correspond to different values of entanglement quantified by other measures .",
    "thus , it can happen that entangled states ordered according to one entanglement measure can be ordered differently by another measure  @xcite .",
    "the most interesting entangled states are , arguably , the boundary states , which are extremal in one measure for a given value of another measure .",
    "they can serve as `` waymarks '' for entangled states providing means for their systematic classification .",
    "moreover , it turns out that some of the most entangled states according to the ree for a given value of another entanglement measure as , e.g. , the negativity  @xcite , are mixed states .    in this paper",
    ", we find maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) corresponding to the largest ree for a given degree of nonlocality using the horodecki measure  @xcite .",
    "we also show that these mems are more entangled than pure states for a wide range of this nonlocality degree . as an indicator of extremality of the found mems we use the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) conditions in a refined method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "the horodecki measure @xmath0 of biv  @xcite for two - qubit states @xmath1 enabled detailed quantitative comparisons with other measures of quantumness including entanglement .",
    "the work of verstraete and wolf  @xcite , where the upper and lower bounds of @xmath0 for a given value of the concurrence @xmath2 were found , is especially relevant to the present paper , where we find the bounds of @xmath0 for a given value of the ree , @xmath3 , for _ arbitrary _ two - qubit states .",
    "other studies were usually limited to _ specific _ classes of two - qubit states generated in some physical processes ( including decoherence ) .",
    "for example , the nonlocality measures were such compared with : the concurrence @xmath2 ( or , equivalently , the entropy of formation )  @xcite , negativity @xmath4  @xcite , fidelity @xmath5  @xcite , as well as the purity @xmath6  @xcite and the closely related degrees of mixedness as measured by either their linear entropy @xmath7  @xcite or participation ratio @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : definitons ] , we introduce some basic definitions of the nonlocality and entanglement measures used in our paper . in sec .  [",
    "sec : special_states ] , we demonstrate analytically that there are mixed states more entangled than pure states when analyzing the ree for a fixed nonlocality ( and negativity ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : damping ] , we describe how to physically obtain an important class of entangled states , which , as we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : kkt ] , are the boundary states if quantified by the ree for given values of the nonlocality , negativity , and concurrence .",
    "the most important result in this paper is finding the states exhibiting the highest and lowest rees for a given value of the nonlocality and demonstrating that mixed states can be more entangled than pure states if the fixed nonlocality is less then @xmath9 .",
    "hereafter , we study general two - qubit density matrices @xmath1 , which can be expressed in the standard bloch representation as @xmath10 where @xmath11 $ ] and the correlation matrix @xmath12 $ ] are given in terms of the three pauli matrices , and @xmath13 $ ] ( @xmath14 $ ] ) are the elements of the bloch vector @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) of the first ( second ) subsystem . expressing the two - qubit density matrix by eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) is very convenient since it allows a direct application of an effective criterion for the nonlocality .",
    "the two - qubit bell inequality in the form derived by clauser , horne , shimony and holt ( chsh )  @xcite can be formulated as @xmath17 where the bell - chsh operator is @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 and its expected value is maximized over real - valued three - dimensional unit vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 . according to the horodecki theorem , the maximum expected value of the bell - chsh operator for a given state @xmath1 reads as  @xcite : @xmath22 given in terms of the parameter @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 are the eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrix @xmath26 constructed from the correlation matrix @xmath27 and its transpose @xmath28 .",
    "hence , the condition for violating the bell - chsh inequality is @xmath29  @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we refer to _ nonlocality _ as the violation of the bell - chsh inequality .    to quantify a degree of the nonlocality , one can directly use @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , or more naturally @xmath32 $ ] ( see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite ) . however , we decided to use another function of @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath0 , which for two - qubit pure states is equal to the concurrence and negativity .",

    "( [ chsh ] ) , and @xmath35 if the inequality is maximally violated .",
    "the value of @xmath36 increases with @xmath37 , thus it can be used to quantify the biv .",
    "we refer to this biv degree as the nonlocality measure .",
    "now , we recall some definitions of a few selected measures of entanglement applicable for two - qubit entangled states .    in our considerations ,",
    "the most important entanglement measure is the ree defined as @xmath38 , which is the relative entropy @xmath39 minimized over the set @xmath40 of separable states @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "this measure is a quantum counterpart of the kullback - leibler divergence quantifying the difference between two classical probability distributions .",
    "evidently , the ree is limited , by definition , to distinguishing a density matrix @xmath1 from the closest separable state ( css ) @xmath41 only .",
    "note that the ree is not a true metric , since it is not symmetric and does not fulfill the triangle inequality .",
    "however , the ree has a desirable property of a good entanglement measure that , for pure states , it reduces to the von neumann entropy of one of the subsystems .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is very unlikely to find an analytical compact formula for the ree of a general two - qubit mixed state , which would correspond to finding its css .",
    "numerical procedures for calculating the two - qubit ree correspond usually to an optimization problem over 79 or more real parameters  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is a compact - form solution of the inverse problem : if a css is known then all the entangled states ( having the same css ) can be given analytically not only for two qubits  @xcite but even for arbitrary multipartite states of any dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the second measure studied here is the negativity @xcite , defined as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denotes partial transpose .",
    "the negativity is related to the logarithmic negativity , @xmath45 $ ] , which is a measure of the entanglement cost under the ppt operations  @xcite .",
    "these two related measures reach unity for the bell states and vanish for separable states , however , for clarity of our further presentation , we will use only the negativity .    the last entanglement measure applied in this paper",
    "is the concurrence introduced by wootters  @xcite as @xmath46 , where @xmath47_j$ ] and @xmath48 .",
    "this measure is directly related to the entanglement of formation , @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "however , for the same reason as in the case of the negativity we use the concurrence instead of @xmath49 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:1 ] , we presented several curves corresponding , in particular , to the horodecki states , bell - diagonal states , and pure states .",
    "the ree for these states can be calculated analytically so let us first discuss and compare them to demonstrate the main point of our paper .",
    "we can simply relate all the above - mentioned entanglement and nonlocality measures in a special case of an arbitrary two - qubit pure states @xmath50 ( with the normalization condition @xmath51 ) as @xmath52 moreover , in this special case @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are simply related to the ree and von neumann s entropy @xmath56 as@xmath57 where @xmath58\\right)$ ] is the wootters function  @xcite given in terms of the binary entropy @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the reduced density matrix of the @xmath61th qubit ( @xmath62 ) .",
