    "over the past two decades , there was a qualitative breakthrough in the development of thermal imaging devices based on uncooled ir focal plane arrays ( fpas ) . at present , two types of bolometer fpas are commonly used as sensors in uncooled ir imagers : the ones based on vanadium oxide ( vo@xmath4 ) or amorphous silicon ( @xmath5-si : h ) thermistors.@xcite despite that the vo@xmath4 is not compatible with the cmos process , the imagers based on this materials are most common on the market .",
    "it should be noted that cmos compatibility is an important advantage of the temperature sensor material : a cmos - compatible manufacturing process considerably decreases the fpa production cost and simplifies its mass production .",
    "the @xmath5-si : h fpas are cmos compatible .",
    "another type of cmos - compatible ir sensors are based on poly - sige thermistors ; they demonstrate high sensitivity and pixel uniformity.@xcite yet they are not used for commercial production of fpas at present .    nowadays ,",
    "reduction of the fpas production cost in conjunction with possibility of their mass production is an important technological goal ; solution of this task will lower prices of ir imagers on the market and widen an area of their applications .",
    "one of promising approaches to solution of this task consists in development of low - cost diode fpas manufactured by a process compatible with the cmos one ; there are many potential advantages of this type of bolometer sensors in comparison with the thermistor ones such as less pixel size at the same sensitivity , the possibility of increasing the sensitivity due to connection of several diodes in one pixel , high uniformity of pixels properties , high stability and low noise , significantly lower power consumption , considerably less heating of a sensing element , and consequently , the possibility of operation in the permanent current mode or variation of the current pulses duration over a wide range , flexibility in the choice of operating modes : constant current or constant voltage , forward or reverse biasing , etc . , and finally easier integration into a standard cmos process .",
    "some time ago , a novel class of uncooled microbolometer ir fpas was developed in which si - on - insulator ( soi ) diodes had been utilized as temperature sensors.@xcite presently , a format of these fpas has reached 2 megapixels;@xcite their noise equivalent temperature difference ( netd ) has made 60 mk at the frame rate of 15 hz and the f - number of 1 that is a very good sensitivity for large - format uncooled fpas .",
    "a soi - diode vga fpa with netd of 21 mk ( f/1 , 30 hz ) and an uncooled infrared micro - camera with the same parameters have also been recently demonstrated.@xcite these remarkable achievements have given a pulse to search for simple cmos - compatible technological solutions based on diode bolometers which would be suited to mass production of low cost ir fpas with netd figures appropriate to various civil  medical and industrial  and tactical applications.@xcite a possible attractive solution consists in utilization of metal / poly - si schottky junctions for formation of sets of connected temperature sensors on bolometer membranes;@xcite the schottky - barrier bolometers were likely first proposed theoretically for high - sensitive cooled detectors in ref ..    in our recent article , nickel silicide schottky diodes formed on phosphorus doped polycrystalline si films were demonstrated to be a promising alternative to soi - diodes in monolithic uncooled microbolometer fpas.@xcite absolute values of their temperature coefficients of voltage and current were found to reach 0.6%/ for the forward bias and be around 2.5%/ for the reverse bias of the diodes despite that the studied diodes were far from perfectness .",
    "a relative ease of production as well as possibility of cascade connection of the schottky diodes increasing the temperature sensitivity of bolometer elements and application of layers of the diode structures of bolometer cells as additional absorbers of the incident radiation may be obvious practical advantages of utilization of the ni - silicide / poly - si junctions .",
    "a solution even more suitable for the industry is considered in the current article .",
    "we propose to apply platinum silicide / poly - si schottky diodes for temperature sensing in microbolometers .",
    "in addition to the mentioned advantages of the nickel silicide / poly - si diodes , ease of integration of technological process of the pt silicide / poly - si diode formation into the standard cmos technology of vlsi manufacturing,@xcite in analogy with the technology of the monolithic ptsi / si ir fpas well developed in the industry,@xcite is the main merit of this approach .    to test the proposed solution we have produced by a cmos - compatible process",

    "we have also studied the _ i ",
    "v _ characteristics of the structures and investigated their temperature sensitivity ( temperature coefficients of voltage @xmath6 for different values of the stabilized current ) at different temperatures .",

    "let us proceed now to the presentation of the obtained results .",
    "chips with the pt silicide / poly - si schottky - diode structures were formed on commercial czochralski - grown single - crystalline silicon wafers ( @xmath7 cm , ( 100)-oriented , @xmath8-type ) coated by a 527 nm thick layer of sio@xmath2 formed by thermal oxidation and a 174 nm thick layer of pyrolytic si@xmath0n@xmath1 ( the dielectric layers simulated a supporting membrane of a bolometer cell).@xcite the process details are presented in fig.[fig : process ] . a film of polycrystalline si with the thicknesses of 125 nm was deposited on the si@xmath0n@xmath1 surface by thermal decomposition of monosilane at the substrate temperature of 620 ; then it was doped by implantation of phosphorus ions ( @xmath9=60kev ) to the dose of @xmath10@xmath11 and annealing at 850 for 30 min .",

    "this assumption is proved by the fact that platinum silicides of known composition follow this dependence with a good accuracy ( the deviation is less than 7% ) : e.g. , ptsi and pt@xmath2si have the densities of 12.39 and 16.27g/@xmath27 , respectively .",

    "si2@xmath8 and si2@xmath61 peaks appear in the spectrum . at second",
    ", the o1@xmath61 signal significantly increases , with the absolute magnitude of the pt4@xmath60 peak noticeably decreasing .",
    "components with maxima at @xmath66 , 72.6 and 75.1ev attributed to pt , ptsi ( and likely pt@xmath2si , i.e. the peaks corresponding to these silicides can not be resolved using non - monochromatic x - rays ) and pt oxide are present in the spectrum ( fig.[fig : xps - hr]b ) ; the contents of these substances in the film correlate as @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the fraction of pt silicide grows more than twice whereas the fraction of pt dioxide decreases by about two times as a result of this technological operation .",
    "the analysis of the si2@xmath8 peak demonstrates that it can be deconvolved into two components with maxima at @xmath68 and 103.4ev ( fig.[fig : xps - hr]c ) ; the more intense component may be attributed to the natural oxide .",
    "this assumption is proved by the presence of a component corresponding to sio@xmath2 in the o1@xmath61 peak ( fig.[fig : xps - hr]e ) ; its intensity slightly exceeds the value which might be explained by the presence of sio@xmath2 that might be attributed , e.g. , to the presence of the surface adsorbate for which oxygen peaks have the same chemical shifts as in sio@xmath2 .",
    "the less intense component of the si2@xmath8 peak ( fig.[fig : xps - hr]c ) corresponds to the si@xmath69 state .",
    "the concentration of the si atoms in this state is close to the concentration of the pt atoms in platinum silicide that allows us to assume the formation of more complex compounds than ptsi and pt@xmath2si in the topmost layer of the pt silicide / poly - si structure such as , e.g. , pt silicates@xcite or some other amorphous substances composed by pt , si and o which can not be detected by the x - ray diffractometry .",
    "the mo peaks in the discussed spectra in figs.[fig : xps ] and [ fig : xps - hr]d , e relate to the sample holder .    taking into the account the presence of intense peaks of pt , si and o we can conclude from the xps analysis of the pt silicide / poly - si structure that its topmost layer is formed by a non - uniform film composed by pt , sio@xmath2 and some compounds of pt , si and o having a complex structure .",
    "a thickness of this film exceeds the depth of sensitivity of xps that is about 10 nm .",
    "this conclusion well agrees with the observations and analysis made above by means of stem and x - ray reflectometry . we should emphasize also that sio@xmath2 , pt silicates , etc",

    "we can conclude now from the above analysis that ( i ) the initial pt / poly - si film contains a pt@xmath2si sublayer , about 6 nm thick , which forms at room temperature at the interface of pt and poly - si during pt deposition on poly - si by magnetron sputtering .",
    "( ii ) about 15 nm thick granular film has formed on top of the pt silicide as a result of the polycide formation in the solid - state reaction of the thin film of pt with poly - si ; it is composed by grains of pt , si , pt silicides and amorphous compounds of pt , si and o. ( iii ) the ptsi phase dominates in the composition of the resultant pt silicide and electrical properties of the produced schottky diode should be determined by the ptsi / poly - si junction .",
    "the obtained structure will be further referred to as ptsi / poly - si .",
    "@xmath24@xmath71 characteristics of the ptsi / poly - si schottky diodes ( fig.[fig : process]k , l ) measured at different temperatures in the temperature interval 24 to 50 are shown in fig.[fig : i - v ] as logarithmic _",
    "i _ curves for several values of the temperature .",
    "the curves in fig.[fig : i - v ] were obtained from one diode randomly selected from a large number of produced chips of diodes of different shapes and sizes ; all the tested diodes had similar _",
    "v _ characteristics , but some parameters varied from chip to chip , e.g. , the rectification ratios varied from several hundreds to more than a thousand for different diode sizes . however ,",
    "in general the dependances of diode current on temperature were similar and the values characterizing the temperature sensitivity , such as _ tcu _ , were close for the examined chips .",
    "so , since we do not set a goal to investigate the production statistics , such as potential yield of the diodes , we will demonstrate the main parameters of the ptsi / poly - si schottky diodes analysing an example of only one but representative sample .",
    "the _ v  i _ curves measured at different temperatures allowed us to derive dependances of the voltage drop across the diode on temperature for different values of current flowing through the diode ( fig.[fig : logu ] ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath72 curves for the forward biased diode are seen to be non - linear for the temperatures from 25 to 50 and current values up to at least 400na .",
    "however , we can see a point around 35 which divides the curves into two nearly linear parts ; if we subdivide the temperature interval into two narrower ones at this point we obtain two sets of straight lines for each of these intervals which enable us to obtain the values of _ tcu _ ( fig.[fig : lnu - fitting ] ) .",

    "these curves are presented in fig.[fig : tsu ] .",
    "the values of _ tcu _ are seen to be negative for all the values of current in the both temperature intervales .    in the temperature interval from 25 to 35 , the absolute value of _ tcu _ initially non - linearly grows with increasing current until saturates at nearly 2%/ when the current is increased to about 400na . if the temperature is in the interval from 35 to 50 , initially high in absolute values _",
    "decreases , reaches minimum at about 150na and then increases again reaching the absolute values some greater than 2%/. so , we can conclude that there exist an interval of current in which _ tcu _ is nearly permanent in the whole temperature interval from 25 to 50 in which we have investigated the ptsi / poly - si diode electrical properties . and",
    "@xmath25 may be explained by changes in the states at the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline schottky diodes.@xcite ]    the obtained values of _ tcu _ allow us to conclude that the ptsi / poly - si schottky diodes are very promising temperature sensors for bolometers having sufficiently high temperature sensitivity . _",
    "tcu _ of a bolometer cell , and hence its sensitivity to a detected radiation , can be easily increased by placing a set of serially connected diodes on a membrane .- noise in these bolometers like it takes place in polycrystalline vo@xmath4 or sige bolometers.@xcite at the same time we expect an increase in signal - to - noise ratio due to size reduction and a large number of diodes on membranes . ]",
    "summarizing the above we should emphasize the main results of the article .",
    "first , using a technological process well developed in the industry , which is compatible with the cmos or ccd manufacturing process , we have formed thin - film ptsi / poly - si ( polycide ) schottky junctions on artificial dielectric si@xmath0n@xmath1/sio@xmath2/si(001):b substrates simulating the bolometer membranes and ready to mems - etching the bolometer cells .",
    "second , the analysis of the polycide formation process has demonstrated that the initial pt / poly - si film contains a pt@xmath2si sublayer , about 6 nm thick , which forms at room temperature at the interface of pt and poly - si during pt deposition by magnetron sputtering . in the process of the pt polycide formation in thin films , a granular film forms on top of the pt silicide ( in this work",
    ", it was 15 nm thick ) ; it turned out to be composed by grains of pt , si , pt silicides and amorphous compounds of pt , si and o. the ptsi phase dominates in the resultant pt silicide and electrical properties of the produced schottky diode are determined by the ptsi / poly - si junction .    and",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that the obtained ptsi / poly - si schottky diodes have sufficient temperature sensitivity ( @xmath77%/ at optimal operating conditions ) to be used as temperature sensors in bolometer detectors of radiation .",
    "their sensitivity exceeds that of standard _",
    "n_-junctions formed in single - crystalline si or in soi substrates whereas their manufacturability in mems processes used for bolometer fabrication is higher than that of mono - si diodes .",
