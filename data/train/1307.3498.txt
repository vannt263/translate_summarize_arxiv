    "lunar occultations ( los ) can efficiently yield high angular resolution observations from the analysis of the diffraction light curves generated when background sources are covered by the lunar limb .",
    "the technique has been employed to measure hundreds of stellar angular diameters , binary stars , and sources with extended circumstellar emission ( see charm2 catalog , * ? ? ?",
    "in the past few years , a program to observe los in the near - infrared at the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) has been very successful both in quantity , with over a thousand events recorded , and in quality with a combination of angular resolution far exceeding the diffraction limit of a single telescope ( @xmath4 ) and a sensitivity significantly better than that currently achieved by long - baseline interferometry ( k @xmath3mag ) .",
    "the drawbacks are that los are fixed - time events , yielding mainly a one - dimensional scan of the source , and that the source can not be chosen at will .",
    "details on the los program at the vlt can be found in @xcite , and references therein .    here , we report on 25 sources discovered to be binary with projected separations below one arcsecond , and in fact mostly below the 57 milliarcseconds ( mas ) diffraction limit of the telescope at the given wavelength .",
    "we also report on one previously known system . in sect .",
    "[ section : data ] we describe the observational procedure , the sample composition , and the data analysis . in sect .",
    "[ section : results ] we report the individual results , and provide some context from previous bibliography when available .",
    "some considerations on the statistics of binary detections from our vlt lo program and on the prospects of follow - up of selected systems are given in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the observations were carried out between april 2010 and october 2011 , using the 8.2-m ut3 melipal telescope of the vlt and the isaac instrument operated in burst mode .",
    "most of the observations were carried out in service mode , based on a strategy of profiting from short slots that might become available depending on the atmospheric conditions and execution status of other service programs .",
    "consequently , the targets were inherently random .",
    "a few observations were parts of isolated nights dedicated to lo observations in visitor mode , and in this case the sources were selected on the basis of their colors and brightness in very extincted regions of the galactic bulge .",
    "the sources observed in service mode have the field `` our i d '' in table  [ tab : list ] beginning with p85 to p88 , which are the eso periods under consideration .",
    "the sources without this prefix were observed in visitor mode .",
    "table  [ tab : list ] provides a list of the observations and of the characteristics of the sources , ordered by time .",
    "a sequential number is included , for ease of cross - reference .",
    "our predictions were generated from the 2mass catalogue , and so is the listed near - infrared photometry . we did not attempt to derive proper k - band photometry from our light curves , due to the lack of calibration sources .",
    "however we notice that in some cases differences between our counts and the 2mass magnitudes of up to a factor 2 are present , pointing to possible variability ( fig .",
    "[ fig : counts ] ) .",
    "further identifications in table  [ tab : list ] , as well as visual photometry and spectral types , are extracted from the _ simbad _ database .",
    "each observation consisted of 7500 or 5000 frames ( in service or visitor runs , respectively ) in a 32x32-pixel ( @xmath5 ) sub - window , with a time sampling of 3.2ms .",
    "this was also the effective integration time .",
    "a broad - band k@xmath6 filter was employed for all events , except in the case of the brighter sources stars 4 and 22 , for which a narrow - band filter centered at 2.07@xmath7 m was employed to avoid possible non - linearities .",
    "the events were disappearances , with lunar phases ranging from 38% to 96% ( median 66% ) .",
    "airmass ranged from 1.1 to 2.0 , while seeing ranged from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ( median @xmath10 ) .",
    "the lo light curves are generated in vacuum at the lunar limb and the diffraction fringes span a range of few 0.1s , so that the technique is in any case largely insensitive to atmospheric perturbations .    the data cubes were converted to light curves by extracting the signal at each frame within a mask tailored to the seeing and image quality .",
    "the light curves were then analyzed using both a model - dependent @xcite and a model - independent method ( cal , @xcite ) .",
    "this latter is well suited to derive brightness profiles in the case of faint binaries , from which the initial values of the model can be inferred .",
    "the least - squares fits are driven by changes in normalized @xmath11 , with a noise model defined for each light curve from the data before and after the occultation .",
    "more details on the instrumentation and the method can be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "it should be noted that only restricted portions of the light curves around the main disappearance , corresponding to angular extensions of @xmath2 , were considered . in general , companions with projected separations larger than this would not appear in our list .",

    "one possible reason for the higher incidence of binaries among the service mode targets is that they are statistically closer to us , therefore providing a better spatial scale for the same angular resolution .      in a previous work based on a comparable volume of lo",
    "observed also in the near - ir in subarray fast mode from calar alto , it was found that the serendipitous binary detection frequency was significantly smaller than the present one , @xmath29% .",
    "the difference can be justified in principle with the lower sensitivity ( limiting k @xmath30mag then , and @xmath3mag here ) and the slower time sampling ( @xmath31ms then , against 3.2ms here ) . however , both cases appear to have an inferior yield of binary stars than observations by a fast photometer : e.g. , @xcite using the tirgo 1.5 m telescope found ( 26/157 ) @xmath32% binary detection frequency .",
    "the explanation in this case is that the targets were brighter , being selected prior to the availability of the 2mass catalog , with average k @xmath29mag .",
    "hence , the sources were generally significantly closer to us than in the present study",
    ".    the flux ratios of the binaries in our list range from @xmath22k=0.0 to 5.4mag , with a median of 2.8mag . from fig .",
    "[ fig : k1k2 ] it can be seen that half of the sample falls in the range 2@xmath334mag . as for the separations , lo can measure only projected values , and the median for our sample is 18mas . considering a random projection correction of 2/@xmath34 , about half of our binaries would remain inaccessible to techniques with less than @xmath35 resolution .",
    "this corresponds , e.g. , to the k - band diffraction limit of a 12 m telescope .",
    "long - baseline interferometry at some of the largest facilities can provide the necessary angular resolution , but it suffers from a sensitivity which is significantly more limited than for lo and in general from a reduced dynamic range .",
    "we outline schematically the situation in fig .  [",
    "fig : brsep ] . from the figure",
    ", it can be estimated that only about 2/3 of the sources in our list might be effectively followed up by independent methods .        in conclusion",
    ", we find from the present work as well as from previous similar research that a routine program of random lo with an ir detector operated in subarray mode at an 8m - class telescope with time resolution of order 3ms can detect companions to stars in the general field down to a sensitivity k @xmath3mag , with separations as small as a few milliarcseconds ( at least 10 times better than the diffraction limit of the telescope ) .",
    "the expected detection frequency can range from @xmath36% in distant regions such as deep in the galactic bulge , to @xmath37% in areas closer to the solar neighbourhood .",
    "most of these binaries or multiples turn out to be new detections , with limited cross - identifications , spectral determinations and previous literature . due to the small separations and high brightness ratios , only up to @xmath38% of these lo - detected binaries",
    "can be followed up by other more flexible methods such as adaptive optics and interferometry .",
    "a significant fraction of such new binary detections will remain isolated until significantly larger telescopes or more sensitive interferometers become available .",
