    "in a recent publication [ 1 ] we have suggested a relativistic field theory model of the deuteron . this model , being some kind of a @xmath4model [ 2 ] , is based on the assumption that the physical deuteron state should be produced due to integration over low ",

    "neutron fluctuations at energies restricted by the scale @xmath5 . for simplification",
    "we have suggested a one  nucleon loop approximation for the integration over proton  neutron fluctuations .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation does not have a perturbative parameter and should be considered as effective one , like that suggested by nambu and jona  lasinio [ 3 ] . in this case",
    "the scale @xmath5 has the meaning of the cut  off .",
    "we have defined @xmath5 in terms of the effective radius of the deuteron @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath7 . for the estimate of @xmath5 we have applied the non  relativistic formula : @xmath8 [ 4,5 ] , where @xmath9 is the binding energy of the physical deuteron [ 5 ] and @xmath10 is the mass of the nucleon .",
    "we used equal masses for the proton and neutron , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to the chiral limit when masses of current u and d  quarks vanish , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath5 gives : @xmath13 .",
    "the interactions of the deuteron with proton and neutron were described in terms of two coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 , defining the interactions via vector and tensor nucleon currents , respectively . in the one  nucleon loop approximation we calculated the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the deuteron @xmath16 in units of the nucleon magneton @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the proton charge , and @xmath19 the electric quadrupole moment . imposing the constraint @xmath20 ,",
    "being valid in the lowest approximation , we found the correlation between coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath21 . then the coupling constant @xmath14 has been fixed in terms of the electric quadrupole moment @xmath19 .",
    "eventually we calculated in one  nucleon loop approximation the binding energy of the physical deuteron in terms of @xmath14 and @xmath5 .",
    "the theoretical result obtained was in good agreement with the experimental value : @xmath22 [ 5 ] .",
    "the physical nature of the coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 is connected with one  meson exchange . of course , the @xmath23meson exchange should give the main contribution .",
    "this assumption has been confirmed by the magnitude of @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the coupling constant of the @xmath26interaction .    the application of the model to the calculation of processes of low  energy interactions of the deuteron encounters the problem of the unambiguous computation of one  nucleon loop digrams that should describe the interactions of the deuteron with other particles in the suggested model .    indeed , since these are fermion loops , most of them , contributing to processes like radiative neutron ",

    "proton reaction p + p @xmath0 d + @xmath2 + @xmath3 and so on , depend explicitely on the shift of virtual momenta of nucleons in the loop .",
    "this introduces substantial ambiguities interfering with the direct application of the model .",
    "however , free parameters appearing due to shifts of virtual momenta in nucleon loops must not be considered as free parameters of the model introduced especially for the computation of every nucleon diagram .    in this paper",

    "this distinguishes our effective model from a field theory like qed , where the electromagnetic gauge invariance should be required for the complete set of diagrams in fixed order of perturbation theory .",
    "the requirement of electromagnetic gauge invariance applied to the individual nucleon loops allows one to fix ambiguities and use one  nucleon loops as well  defined quantum ",

    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sect .  1 we adduce the starting assumptions that we have put in the foundation of the model , and phenomenological parameters in terms of the parameters characterizing the physical deuteron .",
    "in sects .  2 and 3 we give a detailed derivation of the effective corben  schwinger and aronson lagrangians , respectively , describing electromagnetic interactions of the deuteron in terms the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments . in sect .  4 and sect .",

    "proton fusion p + p @xmath0 d + @xmath2 + @xmath3 , respectively . in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the obtained results .",
    "in ref . [ 1 ] we have suggested a relativistic field theory model for the deuteron as a bound state of proton and neutron .",
    "the main idea , that has been put into the foundation of the approach , has been adopted from the nambu  jona  lasinio ( njl ) model [ 3 ] .",
    "as has been suggested by nambu and jona  lasinio [ 3 ] , the physical deuteron should appear as the proton  neutron collective excitation due to a local four  nucleon interaction and vacuum fluctuations of nucleons , calculated in one  nucleon loop approaximation , producing both a kinetic term of the physical deuteron and its interactions with other particles .",
    "unfortunately , the direct realization of the nambu  jona  lasinio program , i.e. the use of the local four  nucleon interaction , would lead to a strongly bound localized proton  neutron state , whereas a physical deuteron is weakly bound and rather `` extended '' object .",
    "therefore , we have borrowed from the njl model only the admission of the applicability of the one  loop approximation .",
    "this is used for the computation of observed parameters for physical states in leading order in the long  wavelength expansion [ 69 ] .    in our description of the physical deuteron ,",
    "being some kind of the @xmath4model , we use the following scheme : we start from the lagrangian of an unphysical deuteron field @xmath27 , considered as a bound proton  neutron state at zero binding energy and with a mass equal to the sum of the proton and neutron masses",
    ". then in the one  nucleon loop approximation and leading order in the long  wavelength expansion we obtain an effective lagrangian of a physical deuteron field describing a physical deuteron with observable binding energy @xmath28 [ 5 ] , anomalous magnetic dipole moment @xmath29 , determined as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the magnetic dipole moments of the physical deuteron , proton and neutron , respectively , and the electric quadrupole moment @xmath34 [ 5 ] .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment of the deuteron is measured in nuclear magnetons @xmath35 , where @xmath18 and @xmath36 are the electric charge of the proton and the mass of the proton and neutron , then @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the proton and neutron . in the case of the neutron the total magnetic dipole moment",
    "coincides with the anomalous one .",
    "below , to simplify matter , we neglect the proton  neutron mass difference and use equal masses of the proton and neutron , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "this should correspond to the chiral limit approximation with zero masses of current @xmath40 and @xmath41quarks , i.e. @xmath42 .    in this connection we would like to refer to the paper written by sakita and goebel [ 10 ] , where , for the aim of the investigation of the low  energy limit of the photodisintegration , the deuteron has been described in terms of a local field operator .",
    "the lagrangian of the unphysical deuteron field @xmath43 , which interacts strongly with the proton @xmath44 and neutron @xmath45 fields , reads @xmath46 d^{(0)}_\\mu ( x ) - \\nonumber\\\\ & & - ig_{\\rm v } [ \\bar{p^c}(x ) \\gamma^\\mu n(x ) - \\bar{n^c}(x ) \\gamma^\\mu",

    "the operator @xmath52 denotes charge conjugation , @xmath53 is a transposition , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the phenomenological constants which will be fixed below .",
    "we assume that the coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 are caused by one  meson exchanges .",
    "the @xmath23meson exchange should give the main contribution .",
    "the guiding principle for the construction of the lagrangian ( [ label1 ] ) has been only the fact that the deuteron is a bound state of the proton and neutron with spin one [ 2 ] .    in order to compute the electric quadrupole and anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the physical deuteron we have to include the interaction the unphysical deuteron field @xmath54 with the electromagnetic field .",
    "having performed this inclusion by a minimal coupling we obtain the lagrangian @xmath55 where @xmath56 a_\\mu(x )   d^{(0)}_{\\nu}(x ) -\\nonumber\\\\ & & - ie\\frac{2g_{\\rm t}}{m_0 } [ \\bar{p^c}(x ) \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } n(x)-   \\bar{n^c}(x ) \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } p(x ) ] a_\\mu(x ) d^{\\dagger(0)}_{\\nu}(x )   - \\\\ & & -i\\,e\\,\\frac{\\lambda}{m^2_{0}}\\,d^{\\dagger ( 0)}_{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\,d^{(0)\\nu \\alpha}(x)\\,{f_{\\alpha}}^{\\mu}(x)\\,- e\\,\\bar{p}(x ) \\gamma^\\mu p(x ) a_\\mu(x)\\,+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ie\\,\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm p}}{4m_{\\rm n}}\\,\\bar{p}(x)\\,\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}p(x)\\,f_{\\mu\\nu}(x)\\,+ \\,ie\\,\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm n}}{4m_{\\rm n } } \\bar{n}(x)\\,\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}n(x)\\,f_{\\mu\\nu}(x)+o(e^2).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the electromagnetic field strength tensor and the electromagnetic potential , respectively .",
    "also we have added the aronson interaction [ 11 ] describing the electric quadrupole and anomalous magnetic moments of the unphysical deuteron : @xmath59 and @xmath60 [ 11 ] .",
    "now let us give some arguments for the justification of the application of the aronson interaction .",
    "recall , that the electric quadrupole and the anomalous magnetic dipole moments characterise the inhomogeneity of the structure of the unphysical deuteron represented in terms of the field @xmath54 .",
    "the availability of such an inhomogeneity is not obvious beforehand and does not follow from the lagrangian ( [ label1 ] ) via a minimal coupling inclusion of the interaction of the unphysical deuteron with an external electromagnetic field .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of nonzero @xmath61 and @xmath62 is an additional assumption concerning the internal structure of the unphysical deuteron field .",
    "since , the minimal coupling leads to the appearance of electromagnetic interactions linear in @xmath63 , the required interaction of the unphysical deuteron field with an external electromagnetic field , caused by electric quadrupole and anomalous magnetic dipole moments , should be of order @xmath64 .",
    "this does not contradict to the main principles of classical electrodynamics [ 12 ] and gives the required interaction in the form , being irreducible with respect to those interactions induced by a minimal coupling .",
    "the aronson effective lagrangian provides a simplest form of an interaction of order @xmath65 [ 11 ] .",
    "the inclusion of the aronson interaction can be also justified by the assumption that the electromagnetic interactions induced by electric quadrupole and anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the unphysical deuteron field with an external electromagnetic field become available only in next  to  leading order in long  wavelength expansion , i.e. in powers of gradients of the deuteron field @xmath63 . in leading order in the long  wavelength expansion , linear in @xmath63 , the interaction of the unphysical deuteron with an external electromagnetic field , caused by electric quadrupole and anomalous magnetic dipole moments , vanishes .",
    "we have taken into account the anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the proton and neutron that play an important role for the radiative neutron ",
    "proton capture n + p @xmath0 d + @xmath1 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath66 and the anomalous magnetic dipole moments of the proton and neutron distinguishes the present model from that given in [ 1 ] .",
    "some of the results and assertions adduced in this section repeat those given in [ 1 ] .",
    "this concerns mainly the computation of the binding energy @xmath67 and the discussion of the validity of the approximation having been applied to the computation of one  nucleon loop diagrams .",
    "this repetition is caused by the consideration of the completeness of the exposition , i.e. in order not to relegate a reader to [ 1 ] for consultation , and the change of the magnitudes of phenomenological parameters of the model .",
    "the former is due to different procedures of the removal of ambiguities of one  nucleon loop diagrams , induced by shifts of virtual nucleon momenta , we use here and we have used in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] . in the present version",
    "all shift ambiguities are fully fixed by requirements of gauge invariance .    following [ 1 ] we compute the effective lagrangian of the physical deuteron field in the one  nucleon loop approximation ( see also [ 69 ] ) .",
    "the nucleon diagrams describing the contributions to the kinetic term of the deuteron field and leading to the appearance of the non  zero value of the binding energy are depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "by calculating these diagrams in leading order in the long  wavelength expansion we get    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the following divergent integrals    the ultra  violet cut  off",
    "@xmath70 restricts the 3momenta of fluctuations of virtual nucleons taking part in the formation of the physical deuteron field .",
    "one should expect that @xmath70 is connected with the region of localization of a wave packet procreated by fluctuations of virtual nucleons , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "we shall specify the value of @xmath72 below .",
    "now we discuss the problem of the applicability of the long  wavelength expansion for the calculation of the one  nucleon loop diagrams in fig .",
    "it is well  known that a two ",
    "body @xmath73wave bound state being denoted as @xmath74 with a reduced mass @xmath75 and a binding energy @xmath67 is localized in the region restricted by @xmath76 [ 4 ] .",
    "this quantity can be considered as the effective radius of the bound state [ 5 ] . in the case of the physical deuteron",
    "we have @xmath77 [ 5 ] .",
    "this value exceeds three times the effective radius of nuclear forces @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the pion mass [ 13 ] .",
    "hence the physical deuteron looks like a rather `` extended '' bound state .",
    "it should be obvious that such an `` extended '' bound state can be formed at the expense of the main contributions of long  wavelength fluctuations of the bound proton and neutron .",
    "it implies that we can expect a cut  off",
    "@xmath70 satisfying the inequality @xmath80 .",
    "it should be obvious that @xmath70 is to be identified with @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 .    the infinitesimality of the derivatives @xmath83 necessary for the validity of the long  wavelength expansion can be justified as follows .",
    "we assume that the deuteron field @xmath27 is a bound state of a proton and a neutron at zero binding energy .",
    "as has been mentioned above , this means that the field @xmath27 is localized in the region whose upper boundary @xmath84 goes to infinity .",
    "obviously it results in a smooth variation of the field @xmath27 at the scale of the effective radius of the physical deuteron .",
    "thus we have adduced some arguments on behalf of the validity of the long  wavelength expansion which has been applied for the calculation of the effective lagrangian ( [ label4 ] ) .",
    "now we proceed to the computation of the binding energy of the physical deuteron .",
    "first , following [ 1 ] , we introduce the field of the physical deuteron @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the wave  function normalization constant . after the renormalization ( 7 )",
    "we get the effective lagrangian of the free physical deuteron field @xmath87 [ 1 ] @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the mass of the physical deuteron and @xmath67 is the binding energy . in the one  nucleon loop approximation and in leading order of the long  wavelength expansion",
    "the binding energy @xmath67 is determined by the expression @xmath90 for the derivation of eq .",

    "then we have to fix the coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 to obtain the theoretical value of the binding energy .",
    "( [ label9 ] ) and ( [ label11 ] ) have been calculated in [ 1 ] .",
    "we need to reproduce them here for two reasons .",
    "first , we give below the new relation between the coupling constant @xmath14 and the electric quadrupole moment @xmath19 .",
    "second , in the conclusion we shall discuss eq .",

    "the mathematical procedure of the removal of such ambiguities which has been used in ref.[1 ] , unfortunately , has left room for residual ambiguities . in the present version ambiguities induced by shifts of virtual nucleon momenta",
