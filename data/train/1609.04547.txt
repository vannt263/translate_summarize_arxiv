    "complex systems modelled as networks exhibit global structures that are commonly affected by the characteristics of their founding elements . indeed",
    ", the properties assigned to these elements often correlate with the architecture of the observed systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to the situations where nodes themselves have peculiar properties that carry significant information regarding their role within the network topology . in literature",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) , the tendency of nodes to link with others that are similar to themselves is a phenomenon called _ homophily _ , which affects the dyadic similarities between nodes and creates correlated patterns among neighbours .",
    "the nodes tendency to connect with each other also relates to the concept of assortative mixing  @xcite which describes correlations because of some nodes properties .",
    "park and barabsi  @xcite noted that , when nodes in a network fit within two distinct groups according to their characteristics , two different parameters , namely dyadicity and heterophilicity , are required to identify the relations between the network topology and nodes features .    the dyadic effect has been considered in order to assess the functional role of nodes within biological networks such as , for instance , in gene - gene interaction in statistical epistasis networks  @xcite , in phenome - genome networks  @xcite in disease - phenotype network  @xcite and in protein - protein interaction networks  @xcite where numerous characteristics are studied to evaluate genetic interactions .",
    "nodes characteristics are investigated also in inter - organizational innovation networks ( @xcite , @xcite ) where partnerships agreements of technological transfer among countries are related to innovation indices .",
    "the methodology presented in  @xcite is able to study exhaustively all the configurations of a binary characteristic on a network using a phase diagram , which lies into a two dimensional space constrained by certain network related bounds .",
    "however , current bounds are computed a - priori considering either particular networks arguments or the number of featured nodes , which results in a space that is often much larger than necessary .",
    "another important issue is related to the phase diagram computational complexity which grows exponentially in the number of nodes , implying some limitations in real applications .",
    "the literature has attempted to overcome these difficulties by using heuristics or statistical methods .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite it is reported a heuristic method able to identify extremal configurations ; in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite statistical methods are used to infer the existence of some configurations in computational biology , while in  @xcite entropy - based measures are used to globally assess the relevance of nodes characteristics .",
    "the contribution of this paper lies in the improvement of current upper bounds through considerations related to structural arguments surrounding a given network .",
    "the reduction of the two dimensional space is performed by not only considering the two upper bounds but by also introducing two lower bounds .",
    "we also present the analytical reasonings and we test their behaviour on different classes of networks .",
    "new bounds foundations are rooted in the degree sequence which can be easily extracted from any network .",
    "although the results we obtain in the space reduction can be valuable , we make use of the straightforward relationships that allow us to compute such bounds independently of the network size .",
    "we provide a reduction of the dyadic effect s feasible region , whic can be used in all the applications where the degree of correlation of the nodes characteristics with the network topology is evaluated considering empirical arguments instead of computing the phase diagram such as , for instance , in  @xcite and  @xcite . moreover , by introducing the four bounds we are limiting the values of dyadicity and heterophilicity to lie in a range that can be easily computed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ probset ] gives the problem setting ; section  [ ulb ] shows the upper and lower bounds ; section  [ ee ] gives the computational analysis ; section  [ conclusion ] presents the conclusions .",

    "herein @xmath0 is considered undirected , unweighted , connected and simple , i.e. loops and multiple edges are not allowed .",
    "the degree @xmath6 of a node @xmath7 is defined as the number of edges in @xmath4 incident to @xmath8 .",
    "the nodes degrees listed in an non - increasing order are referred to as _ degree sequence _ @xmath9 and , as we recall , for every connected graph holds the degree - sum formula or _",

    "a _ graphic sequence _ is defined as a list of nonnegative numbers which is the degree sequence of certain simple graphs .",

    "a generic list @xmath11 of nonnegative numbers is not necessarily a graphic sequence .",
    "indeed , a necessary and sufficient condition is that @xmath12 is even and @xmath13 , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the problem of discovering if @xmath11 is a graphic sequence is called _ graph realization problem _  @xcite .    given an integer @xmath15 , we consider the subsequence of the first @xmath16 elements of @xmath9 calling it @xmath17 as the head of @xmath9 , and the subsequence of the last @xmath16 elements of @xmath9 calling it @xmath18 as the tail of @xmath9 .",
    "a _ clique _ @xmath19 is a complete subgraph of @xmath0 of dimension @xmath16 , i.e. a subgraph of @xmath16 mutual interconnected nodes .",
    "the problem of finding the clique of highest cardinality in @xmath0 is a well known _",
    "np_-problem  @xcite .",
    "since the degree of nodes in a clique of cardinality @xmath16 is at least @xmath20 , a necessary condition for the existence of such clique is that @xmath9 contains at least @xmath16 nodes of degree @xmath21 , otherwise the graph @xmath0 can not contain such clique .    a _ star _ @xmath22 is a subgraph of @xmath0 of dimension @xmath16 showing one node with degree @xmath20 and the others @xmath23 having degree @xmath24 .",
    "traditionally , in graph theory , edges have two endpoints since , by definition , they represent a reciprocal relationship between two nodes . in the literature of graph realisation problem , as well as",
    "that of dynamic graphs , it is possible to admit half - edges anchored at one node of a degree sequence while the other endpoint is free .",
    "this particular object is called _ stub _",
    "@xcite ; when two stubs of two distinct nodes connect , then a classical edge is realized  @xcite .",
    "herein , we refer to a given characteristic @xmath25 , which can assume the values @xmath26 or @xmath24 , for each @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , @xmath3 can be divided into two subsets : the set of @xmath28 nodes with characteristic @xmath29 , the set of @xmath30 nodes with characteristic @xmath31 ; thus , @xmath32 . we distinguish three kinds of _ dyads _ ,",
    "i.e. edges and their two end nodes , in the network : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 as depicted in the figure  [ bpd ] .",
    "we label the number of each dyad in the graph as @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "hence , @xmath39 . we consider @xmath36 and @xmath37 as independent parameters that represent the dyads containing nodes with characteristic 1 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the degree sequence of @xmath0 , we can use @xmath28 and @xmath30 to define its heads @xmath40 or @xmath41 and the tails @xmath42 or @xmath43 such as @xmath44 .",
    "these partitions of the degree sequence are given arbitrarily assigning the characteristic @xmath29 to the @xmath28 nodes with the highest degree or to the @xmath28 nodes with lowest degree or viceversa .",
    "such partitions are reported in figures  [ deg1 ] and  [ deg2 ] , distinguishing the case in which @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "we make this construction in order to use it in section  [ ulb ] .    .",
    "]    when nodes in a network fit within two distinct groups according to their characteristics , two different parameters are required to determine the existence of the relations between the network topology and the nodes features  @xcite . in many systems ,",
    "the number of edges between nodes sharing a common characteristic is larger than expected if the characteristics are distributed randomly on the graph ; this phenomenon is called the dyadic effect  @xcite . if a casual setting among the @xmath3 nodes",
    "is considered , where any node has an equal chance of having the characteristic 1 , the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are  @xcite :    @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the density and is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "the relevant deviations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 from the expected values @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote that the characteristic @xmath24 is not randomly distributed  @xcite .",
    "such deviations can be calculated through the ratios of dyadicity @xmath53 and heterophilicity _ h _ defined as : @xmath54    @xmath55    if the characteristic is dyadic , @xmath56 , it means that nodes with the same characteristics tend to link more tightly among themselves than expected in a random configuration .",
    "conversely when @xmath57 , the characteristic is anti - dyadic , indicating that similar nodes tend to connect less densely among themselves than expected in a random configuration .",
    "the characteristic is defined as heterophilic , with a value @xmath58 , highlighting that nodes with the same features have more connections to nodes with different characteristics than expected randomly . on the contrary , with a value @xmath59 , the characteristic is defined as heterophobic , meaning that nodes with certain characteristics have fewer links to nodes with different characteristics than expected randomly .    in  @xcite , it is enstablished that @xmath36 and @xmath37 can not assume arbitrary values , as there are indirect constraints due to the network structure .",
    "indeed , @xmath36 can not exceed @xmath60 and @xmath37 can not be larger than @xmath61 where _ ub _ stands for upper bound .",
    "one instrument to investigate the correlation among the distribution of a given property @xmath62 and the underlying network structure is the phase diagram which , in general , describes the admissible configurations in the graph .",
    "we consider , as an example , the graph shown in figure  [ example ] , which depicts a network with @xmath63 nodes and @xmath64 edges of which @xmath65 black nodes are randomly distributed ( example and figures  [ example]  [ fig_config ] are taken from  @xcite ) .       , @xmath37 ) .",
    "]    the corresponding phase diagram in figure  [ pdexample ] describes the distribution of a random feature in the system .",
    "it should be noted that the reported phase diagram shows only a subarea .",
    "the phase diagram presents all the admissible combinations of @xmath37 ( @xmath66-coordinate ) and @xmath36 ( @xmath67-coordinate ) and each corresponding square collects the number of assignments of @xmath28 nodes over the set @xmath3 for every fixed @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "there is a direct correspondence among the @xmath37 and @xmath36 axis and , respectively , @xmath68 and @xmath53 , since the values are related through means of eq .",
    "[ eq_d11 ] and eq .",

    "dotted lines indicate the coordinates of @xmath73 . ]    for a given @xmath37 and @xmath36 , each square has a darkness proportional to the degeneracy of the configuration and an open square means that is not possible to place @xmath28 nodes consistently with the fixed values and constraints imposed by the network topology .    beside such squares ,",
    "the phase diagram has some other meaningful areas to discuss .",
    "in particular , the high degeneracy squares are considered as the most typical configurations for a random distribution of a property @xmath73 ; and the phase boundaries squares map atypical configurations . for such phase boundaries",
    "different layouts are recognizable . indeed , in figure",
    "[ fig_config ] , four possible configurations are represented ( where the point of each configuration is correspondingly numbered in the phase diagram of figure  [ pdexample ] ) : @xmath74 is a dyadic case where black nodes concentrate in a central cluster of the graph which maximizes @xmath36 ; @xmath75 is an anti - dyadic configuration where black nodes tend to be farther apart ; @xmath76 is an heterophobic configuration where black nodes are located in the peripheral area which minimize @xmath37 ; and , @xmath77 is an heterophilic configuration where black nodes correspond to the most connected nodes so that the edges with white nodes are maximized .",
    "the graphical nature of the phase diagram allows for easier observation of the distribution of the nodes characteristics , however , as the number of the possible configurations increases exponentially with @xmath3 , the phase diagram is hard to compute for large networks .",
    "moreover , since @xmath78 $ ] it can change while the network structure remains the same . indeed",
    "the number of nodes showing a certain characteristic can change , or different characteristics can be studied by varying @xmath28 , such as in  @xcite . therefore , a complete analysis may require a sequence of @xmath79 phase diagrams computed for each value of @xmath28 as in  @xcite .",
    "an outcome of the latter case for a graph with 25 nodes and 32 edges is shown in figure  [ pdsequence ] .",
    "in this section , we propose an extension of upper bounds ( [ ub11old ] ) and ( [ ub10old ] ) for a graph @xmath0 given @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "moreover , we propose two lower bounds ( _ lb _ ) to @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in other words , we want to restrict the feasible region of the dyadic effect for a graph @xmath0 as much as possible , excluding non - admissible configurations .    we can notice that in  @xcite no lower bounds are provided , thus both bounds on @xmath36 and @xmath37 are assumed to be zero at minimum .",
    "equation ( [ ub11old ] ) states that the maximum number of @xmath36 within a network is equal to the minimum between two quantities : the number of network s edges ( meaning that all the edges are @xmath36 and @xmath81 ) ; the number of edges within a clique @xmath82 , i.e. a complete subgraph with @xmath28 nodes within @xmath0 .",
    "the rationale behind the latter statement is that the upper bound is pushed to the maximum value when @xmath0 is supposed to contain @xmath28 nodes arranged in a clique .",
    "[ propubm11 ] let us consider the degree sequence @xmath9 of the graph @xmath0 with @xmath28 nodes having the characteristic equal to 1 .",
    "the upper bound @xmath70 on the number of edges @xmath36 is : @xmath83    considering the degree sequence , we distinguish two different cases based on the fact that @xmath9 may or may not contain @xmath28 nodes of degree at least @xmath84 . in the former case , the necessary condition for the existence of @xmath82 holds and we can suppose , as a worst case , the realization of a clique @xmath82 considering @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the bound given in formula ( [ ub11old ] ) is the tightest . in the other case , the necessary condition is not upheld",
    ", thus we can affirm that @xmath0 does not contain a clique @xmath82 .",
    "note that if in @xmath9 it is possible to realize a clique @xmath82 , its nodes can be considered the same as those in @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , @xmath9 is an ordered sequence and if @xmath85 does not realize @xmath82 , none other subsequence into @xmath9 can realize it .",
    "therefore , we refer our analysis to the subsequence @xmath85 .    as @xmath82 is the densest possible realization in @xmath85 , we can similarly search for the densest possible realization actually feasible in the subsequence when the clique is not realizable .    considering @xmath85 we distinguish two situations : the sum of its elements being odd or being even . by construction",
    ", @xmath9 is graphic but a subsequence can not be graphic albeit the sum of its elements is even .",
    "indeed , @xmath85 is a graphic sequence only if conditions reported in  @xcite hold ; otherwise , it is not graphic .    therefore , let consider the case in which @xmath85 is graphic .",
    "in this situation , the densest hypothetical realization of @xmath85 is a graph in which the handshaking lemma holds , thus the number of its edges is @xmath86 because each one of the @xmath28 nodes has its degree bounded by the value @xmath84 .",

    ", the realization on @xmath9 has all stubs in @xmath42 saturated while some residual stubs in @xmath41 can create edges that increase the number of @xmath38 .",
    "thus , an overestimation is @xmath107 .",
    "summarizing , we provided certain overestimations on the number of @xmath37 and the minimum among them is our upper bound when @xmath45 .    when @xmath46 , we can partition the degree sequence of @xmath0 as @xmath98 or as @xmath97 ( see figure  [ deg2 ] ) and all the same considerations of above can be repeated , using caution to invert @xmath30 and @xmath28 .",
    "again , we obtain certain overestimations on the number of @xmath37 and the minimum among them is our upper bound .    when @xmath96 , then @xmath44 .",
    "considering the first partition , three situation can be discussed :    * @xmath99 : this happens only when @xmath0 is regular . * @xmath101 : this case is not admissible .",
    "* @xmath108 : not all stubs in @xmath40 have an endpoint in @xmath43 . in this case",
    ", the realization on @xmath9 has all stubs in @xmath43 saturated while some residual stubs in @xmath40 can create edges between nodes not involved in stars . in this case @xmath36 can be different to zero and an overestimation is @xmath102 .",
    "such considerations can be repeated for the second partition of @xmath9 . moreover , knowing the size of the two partitions , we can further bound the introduced quantities and , consequently , @xmath37 . indeed , in order to realize @xmath37 , each element in @xmath40 or @xmath42",

    "finally , the value for the upper bound on the number of @xmath37 can be written as in formula ( [ for_m10 ] ) .",
    "we propose a lower bound of @xmath36 , observing under which conditions a hypothetical graph realization of @xmath9 exists that contains at least some @xmath36 .",
    "such quantity is considered as an underestimation of @xmath36 in the original @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the degree sequence @xmath9 of the graph @xmath0 with @xmath28 nodes having the characteristic equal to 1 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath111 on the number of edges @xmath36 is : @xmath112    given @xmath28 , let consider again the two possible partitions of the degree sequence @xmath44 .",
    "the following three cases hold for @xmath113 :    * @xmath114 or @xmath104 : when admissible , stubs have endpoints in different partitions and @xmath115 ; thus , @xmath116 .",

    "@xmath108 or @xmath119 : when admissible , some stubs in the partition of nodes with the characteristic @xmath29 can link among themselves .",
    "the third case can happen when @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "note that , since we are searching for the minimum number of stubs able to make @xmath122 and that for any given @xmath28 @xmath123 , we can restrict our analysis to the cases when @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , a lower bound on the number of @xmath36 is given by selecting the maximum value between 0 and an underestimation of the possible edges created in the partition @xmath42 , such as in formula ( [ lbm11 ] ) .      when @xmath126 or @xmath127 , the number of @xmath37 is trivially 0 . in all other cases ,",
    "any possible connected realization of @xmath9 contains at least an edge with endpoints with different characteristics , i.e. @xmath128 .    in order to discuss a lower bound on @xmath37 that , in some cases , overcomes the given inequality from above , we take into account certain arguments based on the realizability of a complete , or at least densest , subgraph from @xmath9 , similarly to as in section  [ ubunouno ] .",
    "let us consider the degree sequence @xmath9 of the graph @xmath0 with @xmath28 nodes having the characteristic equal to 1 .",
    "the lower bound @xmath125 on the number of edges @xmath37 is : @xmath129    when @xmath130 we distinguish two cases determined by whether @xmath9 contains @xmath28 nodes of degree at least @xmath84 that allows for a realization of a clique @xmath82 .",
    "if @xmath9 does not contain at least @xmath28 nodes of degree @xmath84 , we can suppose that the densest hypothetical realization of a simple graph involving the maximum number of stubs is the same as in the proof of proposition  [ propubm11 ] . such realization contains the maximum number of @xmath36 and at least one residual stub has to find its endpoint in one of the nodes of the remaining part of @xmath9 because any realization should be connected .",
    "therefore , this case leads us to consider @xmath131 .",
    "if @xmath9 contains at least @xmath28 nodes of degree @xmath84 , then it can hypothetically realize @xmath82 . in order to search for a lower bound on @xmath37",
    "we take into account the subsequence which contains the minimum number of stubs , i.e. @xmath42 .    if a clique can be realized within @xmath42 , then @xmath132 . indeed , every stub that constitutes the residual degree will find its endpoint in a node with @xmath133 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath134 and @xmath131 .",
    "in section  [ phasdiag ] we introduced range values for @xmath53 and @xmath68 and their relationships with the corresponding upper bounds .",
    "since we defined two new formulas for @xmath70 and @xmath69 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 may assume lower values . moreover , the introduction of @xmath111 and @xmath125 results in the definiton of two new quantities , i.e. @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "thus , we can state that :    given a simple graph @xmath0 with @xmath28 nodes having the characteristic equal to 1 , the dyadic effect is bounded as follow : @xmath139 and @xmath140 .    this proposition has a main implication .",
    "indeed , since the dyadic effect has been used to quantify homophily , the proposition sets the bounds on nodes tendency to connect with others similar to themselves by using information on the network itself instead of a priori combinatorial arguments .",
    "in fact , the bounds presented in  @xcite are valid for every graph of @xmath3 nodes , @xmath5 edges and a fixed integer @xmath28 , while the bounds presented in section  [ ulb ] depend on the graphic sequence of the given graph , thus are valid for the set of all graphs having the same @xmath9 .",
    "such set is still wide but has a tighter relationship with the graph under observation .",
    "regarding the applications , when a network and a set of characteristics are given , it is straightforward to compute for each characteristic the point of maximum degeneration @xmath73 , the values @xmath53 , @xmath68 and through the use of the four bounds , @xmath141 , @xmath135 , @xmath142 and @xmath136 .",
    "this approach can be useful in many applications , such as in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite where the phase diagram is hard to compute .",
    "in such contexts statistical approaches are used to gather information on the correlation between nodes characteristics and the network topology by looking for the relative distance of the point @xmath143 from the point of maximum degeneration .",
    "the introduction of the new bounds makes any comparison within the two dimensional space , defined originally in  @xcite and improved in the previous section , more reliable as they are performed on measures that are deeply related to the structure of the analysed graph .",
    "herein , we show empirical evidence computing upper and lower bounds as presented in section  [ ulb ] for different networks .",

    "the data processing , network analysis and all simulations were conducted using the software r  @xcite with the igraph package  @xcite .",
    "all analysis has been conducted considering the given graph @xmath0 with @xmath3 nodes and @xmath5 edges and the value of @xmath28 ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath3 .",
    "values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 were computed straightforwardly and independently of @xmath3 by means of formulas ( [ m11 ] ) and ( [ m10 ] ) and figure  [ m10m11 ] shows their values as a function of the fraction of @xmath28 nodes on @xmath3 and for different values of the density @xmath49 .     and @xmath52 values as a function of the fraction of @xmath28 nodes on @xmath3 . ]    [ b_old ]     +    [ b_new ]      we begin by illustrating the shrinkage of the area in which the phase diagram lies by using the test graph with @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the areas in figure  [ b_old ] and  [ b_new ] represent the sequence of feasible regions for @xmath28 varying from @xmath26 to @xmath3 , each bounded by the correspondent values of @xmath69 , @xmath125 , @xmath70 and @xmath111 . comparing figure  [ b_old ] and figure  [ b_new ] we can immediately notice the difference between the feasible regions provided by old and new bounds as well as the consequent improvements mostly appreciable for high and low values of @xmath28 . in figure  [ b_new ] we observe how , by applying the bounds , the feasible region changes together with the various shapes of the @xmath79 phase diagrams as shown in figure  [ pdsequence ] . moreover , the areas evolve following a trajectory which reflects the trend observed in the curves of the expected values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in figure  [ m10m11 ] .",
    "we applied the proposed bounds to three classes of networks of various size according to their degree distribution .",
    "we chose erds and rnyi random graphs  @xcite and scale - free networks  @xcite and , for each class , we generated ten instances and the results herein are presented as averaged .",
    "we considered networks with @xmath146 with two different settings : the first with an average degree @xmath147 ; the second having a density @xmath148 .",
    "in addition , for each setting we included regular graphs .",
    "the first setting was considered in order to perform an analysis similar to  @xcite while the second setting was chosen in order to test bounds that require @xmath9 from dense graphs .",

    "density was set to @xmath148 ]    the curves in figure  [ grid_1000 ] and  [ grid_3000 ] show the percentage gain obtained from applying each new bound from the perspective of the area covered by the feasible region , with respect to the bounds in formula ( [ ub11old ] ) and ( [ ub10old ] ) when @xmath147 .",
    "this kind of analysis allows us to estimate the bound s behaviour and the dependency of the gain for different networks types .",
    "indeed , we can firstly observe how , fixed the mean degree , the networks size do not affect the bounds as behave exactly the same , while the value of @xmath28 acts as a threshold to trigger the bounds . indeed , upper bounds of formula ( [ for_m11 ] ) and ( [ for_m10 ] ) have a non homogeneous behaviour and for some values of @xmath28 tend to get closer to the values achieved by the bound in formula ( [ ub11old ] ) and ( [ ub10old ] ) .    through observing the analytical relationships",
    "referred the upper bounds , it is evident that homogeneous @xmath9 tends to perform better , while those of a more heterogeneous nature such as , for instance , scale - free networks , perform slightly worse due to the deviation of some nodes from the mean degree .",
    "lower bound @xmath111 evaluation can be performed using a similar approach as for the upper bounds .",
    "note that we can not make any comparisons with previous results being implicitly set to @xmath26 in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath125 gives a contribution that can be considered close to zero due to the fact that it is computed as the difference between the tail of @xmath94 and the edges within @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath147 we deal with very sparse graph , thus the latter difference is always negligible .",
    "we tuned the density to high values ( @xmath148 ) since the terms in @xmath125 formula depend on high degree elements within @xmath9 .",
    "figures  [ grid_1000_d09 ] and  [ grid_3000_d09 ] show the gain obtained through the introduction of new bounds for both erds - rnyi and regular graphs .",
    "scale - free networks were omitted in the test as they are characterized by low density values  @xcite .    in this case , the impact of both lower bounds is more significant , particularly for @xmath125 which differs to zero most substantially when @xmath3 grows .",
    "indeed , as we noticed before , all the bounds depend on the mean degree @xmath151 .",
    "therefore , to keep the value of the density @xmath49 while increasing the network s size , implies the growth of the mean degree as well , since @xmath152 .",
    "comparing figures  [ grid_1000_d09 ] and  [ grid_3000_d09 ] it is evident that when the value of @xmath3 is higher , the impact of the upper bounds tends to be more negligible since their gain is substituted by that of the lower bounds .",
    "finally , the performed analysis reinforces the importance of introducing lower bounds , especially when dealing with dense graphs .",
    "in this paper , we developed two upper bounds and two lower bounds in order to reduce the area of the two dimensional space used to represent the feasible region of the dyadic effect in a network with certain nodes characteristics . using",
    "commonly accepted structural principles , we improved the upper bounds and provided two new lower bounds .",
    "the four bounds can be computed using straightforward analytical relationships with no restrictions on either the network size or classes with the only limitation for the graph to be simple .",
    "these aspects are particularly relevant in the applications where large networks are investigated taking into account numerous characteristics and the dyadic effect is studied avoiding the computation of the phase diagram .",
    "further research should be devoted to study additional aspects .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic behaviour of each bound when the network size grows should be considered .",
    "another point of interest would be to improve the bounds using further arguments , especially in the case of scale - free networks where the proposed approach have seemed to perform less effectively .",
