    "we present the applications of rtm to two case studies . in the first case",
    "the rtm was used to simulate direct solar irradiance spectra , with different water vapor amounts , for the study of the water vapor content in the sierra nevada observatory ( osn ) atmosphere .",
    "simulated spectra were compared with those measured with a spectrometer operating in the 8000  -  10000    range . in the second case the rtm",
    "was used to generate a telluric model to subtract the atmospheric contribution and correct high - resolution stellar spectra from atmospheric water vapor and molecular oxygen lines .",
    "the results of both cases are discussed here .",
    "@xmath0the osn is the southernmost high altitude ( 2900 m a.s.l . )",
    "location in continental europe .",
    "it is located in sierra nevada , granada , spain ( 37.06 n , 3.38 w ) , less than one km away from the iram 30 m telescope . given the dry climatic conditions it can be considered a very competitive location for mir - submm astronomical observations .",
    "we obtained direct solar irradiance spectra with an array spectrometer in the 8000  -  10000    range ( 2.5    spectral resolution ) , during the 2007 - 2009 campaign , for a total of 248 days .",
    "the wyoming university bi - daily radiosounding data were used to provide profiles of temperature ( t ) , pressure ( p ) and h@xmath1o volumetric mixing ratio ( vmr ) as a function of the geopotential height .",
    "the 2003 - 2006 statistics of the radio balloon measurements from granada ( proxy gibraltar ) , canarias ( proxy gimar ) , and hawaii ( proxy hilo ) shows that osn is a very competitive site ( figs .  1  and  2 ) .",
    "the rtm was used to simulate the direct solar irradiance spectra at osn and to compare them with those measured with the spectrometer . the equivalent width ( ew ) of measured spectra in the same water vapor absorption band",
    "were also computed .    o telluric lines in the h@xmath2 region .",
    "data obtained with hrs / het at @xmath3 .",
    "the red vertical bars mark the location of the strongest telluric lines in this wavelength range . ]",
    "we used only the spectra observed @xmath41 hour from the gibraltar noon radiosounding ( 12:00 z ) . for each day , the profiles of p , t and h@xmath1o vmr provided by the radiosounding were used to define the model atmosphere in the rtm .",
    "for each simulated spectrum the ew in the 9270  -  9700    water vapor absorption band was computed , and the corresponding pwv above osn was associated to it .",
    "this provides the calibration shown in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom ) , where blue dots are the individual models for 2007 - 2009 campaign , and the green line is a second order polynomial fit that goes through the `` origin '' ew .",
    "the `` origin '' ew is measured for an atmosphere of zero h@xmath1o column and contributed by the other residual gases ( see the low ew pink line in the spectrum above ) .",
    "notice that we have measured very dry epochs with pwv @xmath5 0.2 mm h@xmath1o .",
