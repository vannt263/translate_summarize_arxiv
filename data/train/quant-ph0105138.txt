    "theory of measurements has a special status in quantum mechanics .",
    "unlike classical mechanics , in quantum mechanics it can not be assumed that the effect of the measurement on the system can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "it is necessary to supplement quantum theory with additional postulates , describing the measurement .",
    "one of such additional postulate is von neumann s state reduction ( or projection ) postulate @xcite .",
    "the essential peculiarity of this postulate is its nonunitary character .",
    "however , this postulate refers only to an ideal measurement , which is instantaneous and arbitrarily accurate .",
    "real measurements are described by the projection postulate only roughly .",
    "the important consequence of von neumann s projection postulate is the quantum zeno effect . in quantum mechanics short - time behavior of nondecay probability of unstable",
    "particle is not exponential but quadratic @xcite .",
    "this deviation from the exponential decay has been observed by wilkinson _",
    "_ @xcite . in 1977 ,",
    "mishra and sudarshan @xcite showed that this behavior when combined with the quantum theory of measurement , based on the assumption of the collapse of the wave function , leaded to a very surprising conclusion : frequent observations slowed down the decay .",
    "an unstable particle would never decay when continuously observed .",
    "mishra and sudarshan have called this effect the quantum zeno paradox or effect .",
    "the effect is called so in allusion to the paradox stated by greek philosopher zeno ( or zenon ) of elea .",
    "the very first analysis does not take into account the actual mechanism of the measurement process involved , but it is based on an alternating sequence of unitary evolution and a collapse of the wave function . the zeno effect has been experimentally proved @xcite in a repeatedly measured two - level system undergoing rabi oscillations .",
    "the outcome of this experiment has also been explained without the collapse hypothesis @xcite .",
    "later it was realized that the repeated measurements could not only slow the quantum dynamics but the quantum process may be accelerated by frequent measurements as well @xcite .",
    "this effect was called a quantum anti - zeno effect by kaulakys and gontis @xcite , who argued that frequent interrogations may destroy quantum localization effect in chaotic systems .",
    "an effect , analogous to the quantum anti - zeno effect has been obtained in a computational study involving barrier penetration , too @xcite .",
    "recently , an analysis of the acceleration of a chemical reaction due to the quantum anti - zeno effect has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although a great progress in the investigation of the quantum zeno effect has been made , this effect is not completely understood as yet . in the analysis of the quantum zeno effect the finite duration of",
    "the measurement becomes important , therefore , the projection postulate is not sufficient to solve this problem .",
    "the complete analysis of the zeno effect requires a more precise model of measurement than the projection postulate .",
    "the purpose of this article is to consider such a model of the measurement .",
    "the model describes a measurement of the finite duration and finite accuracy .",
    "although the used model does not describe the irreversible process , it leads , however , to the correct correlation between the states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus .    due to the finite duration of the measurement",
    "it is impossible to consider infinitely frequent measurements , as in ref .",
    "the highest frequency of the measurements is achieved when the measurements are performed one after another , without the period of the measurement - free evolution between two successive measurements . in this paper",
    "we consider such a sequence of the measurements .",
    "our goal is to check whether this sequence of the measurements can change the evolution of the system and to verify the predictions of the quantum zeno effect .",

    "the operator @xmath2 causes the jumps between different energy levels of @xmath0 .",

    ".    we will measure in which eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath0 the system is .",
    "the measurement is performed by coupling the system with the detector .",
    "the full hamiltonian of the system and the detector equals to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the detector and @xmath6 represents the interaction between the detector and the system .",

    "the initial density matrix is chosen in a factorizable form , the density matrix of the system after the interaction depends linearly on the density matrix of the system before the interaction .",
