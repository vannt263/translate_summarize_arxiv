    "our understanding of the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies is undergoing something of a renaissance .",
    "the comfortable classical hierarchical merging scenario in which massive ellipticals form later than their less massive counterparts , faces challenges when confronted with empirical evidence for the existence of old , metal - rich , proto - ellipticals at redshifts @xmath1@xmath22@xmath33 .",
    "the concepts of downsizing ( in which stars in more massive galaxies form earlier and on a shorter timescale than in less massive systems ) and dry mergers ( dissipationless merging of stellar systems , without associated star formation ) have proven to be popular enhancements to the conventional picture , although both face challenges in the face of the constraints imposed by known correlations in optical (  colour - magnitude , luminosity - metallicity , fundamental plane ) and x - ray (  luminosity - temperature - metallicity ) properties .    while the semi - analytical methodology remains powerful when exploring both monolithic (  gibson 1997 ) and merger - driven (  pipino 2006 ) frameworks for galaxy formation",
    ", the computational approach has progressed to the stage where fully coupled multi - wavelength spectro - chemical + dynamical simulations of ellipticals are now feasible .",
    "for example , the origin of optical scaling relations and abundance gradients has been explored recently by kobayashi ( 2004 ) , within the idealised context of semi - cosmological initial conditions , while the power of fully cosmological hydrodynamic simulations , which neglect both supernovae and agn feedback , has been demonstrated by domnguez - tenreiro  ( 2006 ) and naab  ( 2006 ) .",
    "recent cosmological simulations which include treatments of feedback include those of meza   ( 2003 ) , sommer - larsen   ( 2003 ) , and kawata & gibson ( 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "kawata & gibson ( 2005 ) studied the effect of agn heating on the chemodynamical evolution of ellipticals , including the impact on both the integrated optical (  colour - magnitude relation ) and x - ray (  luminosity - temperature - metallicity relations ) properties .",
    "driven by central convergent gas flows , the self - regulating nature of agn heating within the kawata & gibson simulation leads to a stable hot corona and the suppression of late - time star formation .",
    "the cosmological elliptical simulated was shown to be consistent with these observed integrated properties .",
    "instead of repeating the discussion of kawata & gibson ( 2005 ) , in what follows we report on our recent work in assessing the success ( and failure ) of our current suite of simulations in recovering various spatially - resolved optical and x - ray observables .",
    "this report is very much a work - in - progress , but should provide the reader with an overview of the direction in which we are heading .",
    "our reference simulation here corresponds to model  2 of kawata & gibson ( 2005 ) , a mildly triaxial , slow oblate rotator , whose central line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath4 and rotation velocity v@xmath5 match those of , for example , ngc  3379 ( @xmath650  km / s and @xmath6250  km / s , respectively).11  kpc , while that of ngc  3379 is @xmath62  kpc . ] making use of its simulated optical isophotes , we measured the @xmath7=4 deviations from perfect ellipses ( the so - called @xmath8 parameter )",
    ". viewed at high - inclination the galaxy can be characterised as possessing disky ( @xmath8@xmath90 ) isophotes over the range 0.5@xmath10@xmath11@xmath101.5 , and boxy ( @xmath8@xmath120 ) isophotes beyond @xmath11@xmath22 ( see fig  1 ) , consistent with that found by meza  ( 2003 ; fig  11 ; 50@xmath13@xmath10@xmath14@xmath1070@xmath13 ) for their cosmological elliptical galaxy simulation , and the disky isophotes observed within the effective radius of ngc  3379 .",
    "= 4 deviations from perfect ellipses ( top to bottom panels , respectivey ) for model  2 of kawata & gibson ( 2005 ) , as viewed in projection at high - inclination . ]",
    "diehl & statler ( 2006 ) have recently suggested that the hot coronal gas within @xmath11@xmath122 and the underlying stellar components of ellipticals appear to have broadly aligned position angles , but the ellipticities are not well - correlated , as might be expected in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we attempted to confront our simulations with this chandra - inspired empirical evidence by fitting ellipses to the x - ray contour maps of our reference simulation ; unfortunately , insufficient resolution compromised our ability to do so .",
    "it is clear though that the next - generation of simulations will be ideally suited for this problem ( gottlber  2006 ) .      in the upper ( left ) panel of fig  2 ,",
    "we show the light - weighted iron ( blue ) and oxygen ( red ) abundance gradients for the stellar component of kawata & gibson s ( 2005 ) model  2 ; the bottom ( left ) panel shows the corresponding abundance ratio ( [ o / fe ] ) gradient . near the effective radius , the gradients in [ fe / h ] and",
    "[ o / fe ] are d@xmath12[fe / h]@xmath9/d(log  @xmath15)@xmath2@xmath160.3 and d@xmath12[o / fe]@xmath9/d(log  @xmath15)@xmath2@xmath170.1 , respectively .",
    "the agreement with the gradients derived by snchez - blzquez et  al .",
    "( 2006)@xmath181 . ] for ngc  3379 ( d@xmath12[fe / h]@xmath9/d(log  @xmath15)@xmath2@xmath160.30 and d@xmath12[o / fe]@xmath9/d(log  @xmath15)@xmath2@xmath170.04 , respectively ) is re - assuring ( and admittedly , perhaps a coincidence ) and consistent with the similarity found between the morphology of ngc  3379 and our reference model (   2.1 ) .",
    "our simulated elliptical is consistent with the predictions of `` outside - in '' scenarios , albeit with a somewhat shallower [ o / fe ] gradient than the default model of pipino  ( 2006).[o / fe]@xmath9/d(log  @xmath15)@xmath2@xmath170.3 . ]        over the range 1@xmath10@xmath11@xmath105 , the abundance ( and abundance ratio ) gradients in the hot corona of our simulated elliptical are d@xmath12[fe / h]@xmath0@xmath9/d(log  @xmath15)@xmath2@xmath160.6 ( a factor of two steeper than the iron gradient in the stellar component at @xmath11@xmath101 ) and d@xmath12[o / fe]@xmath0@xmath9/d(log  @xmath15)@xmath2@xmath170.1 ( which matches that of the stellar component at @xmath11@xmath101 , albeit , obviously offset by a factor of five in magnitude - see above ) , respectively .",
    "this abundance ratio is consistent with a scenario whereby @xmath670% of the iron associated with the hot corona originated from type  ia supernovae ( gibson  1997 ) .",
    "using spatially - resolved metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) from hst , harris & harris ( 2002 ) infer a metallicity gradient for the stellar population of ngc  5128 of d(@xmath12[m / h]@xmath9)/d(log  r@xmath19)@xmath2@xmath160.5  dex / log  r ( for 1.4@xmath10r@xmath19@xmath104 ) ; the fwhm dispersion of these empirical mdfs is @xmath61  dex ( see fig  3 ) . at the same effective radius , our simulated elliptical possesses a flat gradient in [ m / h ] ( again , see fig  3 ) , matching such an inferred steep empirical slope only in the inner region of the galaxy ( over the range 0.2@xmath18r@xmath19@xmath180.5 - recall fig  2 ) .",
    "this should not be surprising given that the simulation in question possesses gradients more broadly consistent with ngc  3379 (   2.2 ) than ngc  5128 , but for illustrative purposes here the comparison remains of interest .",
    "of perhaps more immediate interest though is the fact that the dispersion in the simulated mdfs is @xmath61.5  dex ( fwhm ) , a factor of 2 - 3 broader than the empirical mdfs .",
    "whether this apparent discrepancy is a manifestation of a `` g - dwarf '' problem , contamination of the inner field mdf by a secondary bulge component , or partially driven by observational selection effects , remains unclear ; what can not be disputed though is the potential for future mdf observations to constrain elliptical galaxy formation scenario ( pipino  2006 ) .",
    "while our past and ongoing work has proven successful across a range of testables , it is perhaps more interesting to emphasise here several of the unsolved problems , challenges , and potential pitfalls , remaining .",
    "for example , the observed abundances in the hot coronal gas of ellipticals are ( roughly speaking ) solar ( for fe , mg , si , s , and ar ) , half - solar ( o and ne ) , and three times solar ( ni ) , while in the hot intracluster medium of galaxy clusters it is 0.3@xmath20 solar for fe , twice solar for si , half - solar for s , solar for ni , and @xmath120.1@xmath20 solar for ar and ca ( with significant cluster - to - cluster variations ) .",
    "no combination of type  ia and type  ii supernovae can be made consistent with these data , implynig the need for some additional metal source(s ) .",
    "that said , one remains contrained by empirical supernova rates now derived out to @xmath1@xmath21 , while pop  iii stars and hypernovae do not appear to be a panacea in this regard .",
    "is the fact that our simulated mdf is @xmath60.5  dex broader than the empirical mdf derived from ngc  5128 of concern ?",
    "is there a serious g - dwarf problem ?",
    "how robust are our x - ray luminosity - weighted abundance and abundance ratio gradients at @xmath63  @xmath21 ?",
    "is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion skewness @xmath22 correlated with the sense of direction of the rotation velocity ( meza  2003 ) ?",
    "are the optical and x - ray isophotes correlated in position angle and/or ellipticity ?",
    "what impact might mass - dependent star formation and agn feedback efficiencies play ?",
    "single simulations , such as that described here or in meza  ( 2003 ) , have proven enticing , but what is now needed is a significant statistical sample of cosmological elliptical galaxy simulations before we can properly address the nature of these empirical trends .",
