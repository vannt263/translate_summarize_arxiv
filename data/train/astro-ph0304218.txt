    "an iron k@xmath0 emission line at 6.4  kev  is commonly observed in the x - ray spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) .",
    "the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the lines are usually @xmath4100300  ev @xcite , suggesting that a significant column of iron is necessary to produce the required emission .",
    "this was confirmed with the discovery of the compton reflection hump between 2030  kev  @xcite which is a natural outcome of x - ray reprocessing in optically - thick material @xcite . in some cases , sensitive observations of the fe  k@xmath0line",
    "have found them to possess broad low - energy wings , consistent with the profile expected from a spinning accretion disk close to the black hole ( see the reviews by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these relativistically broadened lines have been seen in both agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and gbhcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and provide strong evidence that the optically - thick reflector responsible for the shape of the x - ray continuum is the inner region of the accretion disk . thus , there has been considerable attention paid in recent years to the fe  k@xmath0  line and x - ray reflection features in accreting black holes , as they may probe the physics of the flows only a few schwarzschild radii from the event horizon .",
    "the phenomenology outlined above has given rise to a theoretical framework in which the x - rays are generated by some process in a corona above the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "roughly half of the x - ray power illuminates the disk , is reprocessed , and then reemitted as a reflection spectrum which carries the fe  k@xmath0  line and reflection hump @xcite .",
    "the iron line is produced by fluorescence ; that is , incoming x - rays ( usually in the form of a power - law ) with energies greater than 7.1  kev  can remove a k shell electron from an iron atom or ion .",
    "the excited ion can then relax by a radiative transition into the k shell , or by the expulsion of an outer shell electron ( the non - radiative auger effect ) . with this mechanism",
    "the flux in the line is directly proportional to the ionizing flux @xcite , so that changes in the illuminating continuum should give rise to correlated changes in the fe line flux .",
    "however , long monitoring campaigns of certain bright agns have shown that , at least in those sources , the fe  k@xmath0  line exhibits weak variability on short timescales despite large changes in the continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "revisions to the standard disk - corona model are necessary to explain this behavior @xcite .",
    "fluorescence from photoionization is not the only mechanism able to generate an iron k line .",
    "electron bombardment of the accretion disk can also produce line emission from iron if the kinetic energy of the particle is greater than 7.1  kev .",
    "this process has been used to explain enhanced line emission from the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where electrons energized in the solar corona travel down magnetic field lines and strike the photosphere @xcite . as accretion disks",
    "likely also possess such magnetized coronae @xcite , it is possible that similar situations would arise and result in fe  k@xmath0  emission by electron bombardment .",
    "in accretion disk coronae there exists a bath of thermal electrons with temperature @xmath5@xmath6  kev  ( which generates the primary x - ray power - law through comptonization of the disk uv photons ) .",
    "there may also be a non - negligible amount of non - thermal electrons present in the corona .",
    "evidence for these particles has been found in _",
    "compton gamma - ray observatory _ observations of cyg  x-1  in its soft state @xcite and grs  1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "these data , when combined with simultaneous hard x - ray observations , show that the x - ray power - law extends to energies @xmath7  kev .",
    "such spectra can be well fit by a model of comptonization in a hybrid thermal / non - thermal plasma @xcite . at present",
    "there are no analogous observations for radio - quiet agn , but it is expected that the disk - corona physics will be similar for the two systems .",
    "proton illumination will also produce fe  k@xmath0  emission in a manner analogous to electron bombardment .",
    "this may occur in a geometry where the optically thick accretion disk is disrupted into a hot ion flow close to the black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ". this configuration may be relevant to gbhcs in the low / hard state @xcite and low luminosity agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the accretion energy is envisaged to be dissipated into the protons within the central optically thin flow , which then rapidly reach the virial temperature as they can be thermally decoupled from the electrons @xcite .",
    "the majority of the accretion energy is carried into ( or advected ) into the black hole by the protons with little or no observational signatures .",
    "thus , these `` advection dominated accretion flows '' ( adafs ) can be very radiatively inefficient @xcite .",
    "however , if the optically thick disk partially overlaps with the adaf ( for example , in the region where evaporation of the disk is taking place ) , then the hot protons in the adaf will interact with the disk , significantly heating its surface @xcite and possibly producing fe  k@xmath0  emission .",
    "proton impact ionization would also be relevant if a two - temperature corona exists above an untruncated accretion disk @xcite .",
    "if energetic coronal electrons ( in an accretion disk - corona model ) or virialized protons ( in a truncated disk - adaf model ) strike the accretion disk they would produce fe  k@xmath0  emission .",
    "if this process is sufficiently efficient it could generate an observable line that is not strongly correlated with the continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this then must be integrated over the distribution of initial electron energies to find the total fe  k@xmath0  line flux .",

    ", electrons with larger energies travel a greater distance before their kinetic energy falls below @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite showed that an electron with initial energy @xmath25 will have an energy @xmath34 after traversing a hydrogen column @xmath35 .",

    "if protons are the incident particles then the equation for the energy loss rate is modified only is a function of the reduced mass of the scattering interaction and so will change with the different incident particle .",
    "however , the dependence is logarithmic in nature and so can safely be neglected .",
    "] by a factor of @xmath38 @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the proton mass , @xmath41 is the electron mass , and now @xmath11 is the kinetic energy of the impacting proton .",
    "note that protons lose their energy much more rapidly than electrons .",
    "as before , we have assumed the `` cold target '' approximation which in this case requires @xmath42 .",
    "for agn disks , this condition implies @xmath43  kev , while it is @xmath44  kev for the hotter gbhc disks . the virial temperature for a proton a distance @xmath45 away from a black hole is @xmath46  mev , where @xmath47 is the schwarzschild radius for a black hole of mass @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , assuming the protons in the adaf reach the virial temperature , their energies will be greater than 1  mev if @xmath49  @xmath50 and so equation  [ eq : p1 ] will be valid for both agn and gbhcs .    we can now write down the analogous expression to equation  [ eq : flx - ei ] for the fe  k@xmath0  line flux due to proton impact : @xmath51 de_0 , \\label{eq : flx - pi}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the spectral proton flux ( protons  @xmath9  s@xmath10  kev@xmath10 ) normally incident on the disk , and @xmath53 is the k - shell ionization cross - section of iron due to a proton with kinetic energy @xmath11 .",

    "furthermore , equation  [ eq : flx - fl ] is only valid in the optically - thin limit .",
    "that is , we are ignoring any attenuation of the incident x - rays or the outgoing fe  k@xmath0  line photons .",
    "therefore , we are limited to columns @xmath62  @xmath9 , where @xmath63 is the thomson cross - section , and we have assumed a 10% abundance of helium ( by number ) .",
    "the implications of limiting the calculations to thomson thin columns are considered in the next section .",
    "another particle process that can produce fe  k@xmath0  emission is charge exchange collisions .",
    "these are reactions of the following form : @xmath64 , where a is usually h , h@xmath65 , or he .",
    "the product fe ion is often left in an excited state and will produce line emission as it relaxes .",
    "this collision differs from those described above in that the fe ion is the energetic particle and the hydrogen or helium atom is the target .",
    "this process may be important for explaining the strong and broad k@xmath0 lines from hydrogenic and helium - like fe observed in the galactic ridge x - ray emission @xcite . in this case , highly ionized fe ions in the cosmic - ray distribution interacting with neutral galactic gas would produce the needed line emission .    for the accretion disk scenario that is considered here ,",
    "it is unlikely that charge exchange will be an important process , as there are very few neutral h and he atoms available for the reaction .",
    "other metal ions could act as donors in a collision with fe , but , for typical cosmic abundances , encounters with the correct kinematics would be extremely rare . however , charge exchange may possibly be relevant to iron k lines emitted from the molecular torus of agn unification schemes ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if there is a flux of energetic fe ions incident on this gas .",
    "to determine how efficient electron impact is in producing an fe  k@xmath0line in comparison to photoionization , we calculate the ratio of equations  [ eq : flx - ei ] and [ eq : flx - fl ] : @xmath66 de_0 \\over 2 \\pi e^4 \\lambda n_{\\mathrm{h } } \\int_{\\chi}^{\\infty } f_{\\epsilon}(\\epsilon ) \\sigma_{\\mathrm{photo}}(\\epsilon ) d\\epsilon}. \\label{eq : ratio}\\ ] ] considering this ratio will also help negate the effects of absorption and scattering on the k@xmath0 line that were ignored in the individual expressions",
    ". this value will nevertheless be only a upper limit , because in the true thomson thick case high energy photons can scatter down to energies where they can ionize iron and produce a k@xmath0 photon .",
    "some fraction of the line photons will escape the layer , but to accurately treat this process requires a numerical prescription .",
    "the k - shell photoionization cross - section ( @xmath61 ) was taken from the tabulation by @xcite .",

    "these cross - sections are plotted between @xmath26 and 200  kev  in figure  [ fig : xsect1 ] , where the x - axis is used for both photon energy and electron kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath61 is roughly proportional to @xmath67 and so falls off much more rapidly than @xmath68 ; however , @xmath61 is significantly greater than @xmath68 for energies below 40  kev .",
    "a power - law photon spectrum was assumed for all the calculations described below : @xmath69 , where @xmath70 or @xmath71 is the photon index .",
    "for each value of @xmath72 the spectrum was normalized so that the total energy flux between @xmath26 and 200  kevat the surface of the disk was 1  kev  @xmath9  s@xmath10 .",
    "a value of 25 is chosen for the coulomb logarithm @xmath16 @xcite , but , as will be seen below , the results are insensitive to its value .",
    "the value of @xmath35 and equation  [ eq : emin ] determines the upper - limit to the outer integral in the numerator of equation  [ eq : ratio ] .",
    "k@xmath0 photons produced by electrons with kinetic energies larger than this are accounted for in a later bin where the column is large enough for the energy of those electrons to pass below @xmath26 .",
    "since the largest column we consider is @xmath73  @xmath9 , there is a slight error as we do not count any fe  k@xmath0  emission produced by electrons that can pass through this column .",
    "however , equation  [ eq : emin ] shows that only electrons with kinetic energies greater than @xmath74  mev can still ionize iron beyond a column of @xmath73  @xmath9 . for the electron distributions we consider ,",
    "there is a negligible amount of electrons with @xmath75  mev , so this slight error will not impact the results .",
    "modeling of the hard x - ray tails in the gbhcs cyg  x-1 and grs  1915 + 105 have shown that the non - thermal electrons responsible for this emission can be described as a soft power - law @xcite .",
    "therefore , we first consider electron distributions of the form @xmath76 , where @xmath77 or @xmath78 is the number index .",
    "as with the photon distribution , the incident electron power - laws are normalized such that the total energy flux between @xmath26 and @xmath6  kev  is 1  kev  @xmath9  s@xmath10 . in this way",
    ", roughly the same amount of energy is being deposited into the material by both the electrons and photons .",
    "figure  [ fig : eplaw ] shows the results of computing the ratio @xmath79 for the different values of @xmath72 and @xmath80 .",
    "each panel shows the results for an individual photon index , while the different lines denote the electron number index . in every case",
    "considered here the fe  k@xmath0  flux from electron impact is a small fraction of that produced by photoionization .",
    "the maximum ratio found is @xmath81 when @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the thomson depth ( @xmath84 ) is @xmath85 .",
    "the ratio then drops rapidly as the column increases as less and less electrons are able to penetrate further into the gas .",
    "the only exception is for @xmath83 .",
    "this electron spectrum is very flat so that the energy flux per decade actually increases with energy , and so there are many high energy electrons that can still ionize fe  k@xmath0  at larger column densities .",
    "the electron k - shell cross - section is close to a constant at high energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xsect1 ] ) , which helps keep the ratio roughly the same as the column increases .",
    "however , even with this extreme spectrum , electron impact is still an inefficient method to produce fe  k@xmath0photons .    as @xmath80",
    "is increased , the ratio at all @xmath86 drops .",
    "this is a result of the shape of the cross - section which peaks at electron energies of @xmath87  kev  and not at the the ionization threshold , @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xsect1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , when the electron spectrum softens , more electrons have lower energies , below the peak in the cross - section , and the fe  k@xmath0  flux decreases accordingly .",
    "there is also a slight change in @xmath88 with the photon - index .",
    "the ratio lowers as @xmath72 increases because for softer photon spectra there are more photons at lower energies , which is where @xmath61 is larger .",
    "this increases the number of k@xmath0 photons emitted , and therefore decreases the ratio .",
    "observations by _ bepposax _ have shown that many seyfert  1 galaxies have high energy cutoffs between 100 - 300  kev  @xcite .",
    "if the hard x - rays in these agn are produced by thermal comptonization , then such measurements can constrain the temperature of the coronal electrons by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the cutoff energy .",
    "we now consider the production of fe  k@xmath0  photons by electrons in a thermal distribution , described by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with @xmath91 or @xmath92  kev .",
    "as before , the electron spectra were normalized so that the total energy flux incident on the gas between @xmath26 and 200  kev  was 1  kev  @xmath9  s@xmath10 , the same as for the photon spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : emax ] plots the fe  k@xmath0  flux ratio between electron impact and photoionization for electrons in a thermal distribution .",
    "again , the flux of k@xmath0 photons produced by the electrons is @xmath93  1 per cent of that generated by photoionization .",
    "an interesting difference between the thermal and power - law electron distributions is that the largest flux ratio occurs some distance into the layer for a maxwellian population and not at the surface , as was found with the power - law .",
    "this is because the number of electrons in the thermal distribution peaks at energies @xmath94 , and can thus ionize fe to larger columns .",
    "therefore , the maximum ratio moves to greater @xmath86 for larger @xmath95 .    except for the lowest columns , @xmath96 increases with @xmath95 .",
    "the total number of electrons in the distribution grows with @xmath95 , and , since the spectrum is normalized so that the energy deposited between @xmath26 and 200  kev  is the same for each case , the excess electrons are found at higher energies .",
    "this fact , combined with relative flatness of the k - shell cross - section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xsect1 ] ) , explains the small increase in @xmath96 with @xmath95 .",
    "we form the ratio of fe  k@xmath0  flux produced by proton impact to that generated by photoionization by using equations  [ eq : flx - pi ] and [ eq : flx - fl ] : @xmath97 de_0 \\over 2 \\pi e^4 \\lambda n_{\\mathrm{h } } \\int_{\\chi}^{\\infty } f_{\\epsilon}(\\epsilon ) \\sigma_{\\mathrm{photo}}(\\epsilon ) d\\epsilon}. \\label{eq : ratio2}\\ ] ] the calculation of the denominator of equation  [ eq : ratio2 ] is unchanged from the previous section ( e.g. , @xmath98 ) .",

    "this cross - section is plotted along with the ones for photoionization and electron bombardment in figure  [ fig : xsect2 ] .",
    "unfortunately , the formula is only valid for proton kinetic energies less than @xmath99  mev . through equation  [ eq : emin - p ] ,",
    "this limits the column density that can be probed to be @xmath100  @xmath9 .",
    "this section considers the fe  k@xmath0  flux produced by a distribution of protons at the local virial temperature , @xmath101",
    ". this situation may be applicable to the case where a relatively cold , thin accretion disk overlaps with a hot , adaf - like flow @xcite . due to the 50  mev cutoff in the proton impact cross - section ,",
    "we are limited to proton spectra which do not have many particles above this energy .",
    "a maxwell - boltzmann distribution is assumed for the particles , and three cases are considered : @xmath102 and @xmath103  mev .",
    "these values correspond to the virial temperature at @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106  @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the proton spectra are normalized so that the total energy flux incident on the gas is 1  kev  @xmath9  s@xmath10 . the fe  k@xmath0  flux produced by the incident protons",
    "will be compared with that from a power - law photon spectrum , which is normalized to 1  kev  @xmath9  s@xmath10 between @xmath26 and 200  kev .",
    "the results are show in figure  [ fig : pmax ] . for each case",
    ", it is found that the protons produce a negligible amount of fe  k@xmath0  emission as compared to photoionization .",
    "this is in part due to the normalization conditions .",
    "the spectra were normalized so that both the protons and the photons deposited the same amount of energy ( per unit area , per unit time ) into the material .",
    "as the majority of the protons carried 2 - 3 orders of magnitude more energy than a typical incident photon , there are far fewer protons in the illuminating distribution than photons ( this should be contrasted with the situation described in   [ sub : eres ] , where there was roughly equal numbers of electrons and photons ) .",
    "however , even if the spectra were normalized to the same number flux , the fe  k@xmath0  emission produced by protons would still be much less than that from photoionization .    of the three values of @xmath101 considered , it is the middle one ( @xmath107  mev ) that results in the largest @xmath108 , due to the peak in its energy flux residing closest to the maximum cross - section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xsect2 ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is the @xmath109  mev spectrum that has the greatest ratio at low @xmath86 .",
    "this is because this distribution has a large number of relatively low energy particles which stop quickly in the gas , and so produce their k@xmath0 photons close to the surface .",
    "the other distributions predominantly have much high energy particles which can penetrate through to larger columns .",
    "one other effect that is noticeable in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmax ] is the decrease in @xmath108 as the photon - index , @xmath72 , increases .",
    "as explained in sect .",
    "[ subsub : eplaw ] , the softer photon spectra have more photons at low energies , where the cross - section is larger , and will produce more k@xmath0 photons , thereby lowering the ratio .",
    "we have shown that particle impact is an inefficient method to produce fe  k@xmath0  emission as compared to photoionization ( see also @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "we attempt to place this result in the wider context of accretion disk models and particle acceleration mechanisms .",
    "we begin with the electron bombardment results and their relation to models of coronae above geometrically thin disks .",
    "proton impact and the two - component disk model is discussed at the end of the section .",
    "it has been argued for some time that the energy responsible for heating the electrons in an accretion disk corona is carried and released by magnetic fields expelled from the disk surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetic energy ( ultimately derived from the magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) turbulence in the body of the disk ; @xcite ) would then be liberated by reconnection events with neighboring field lines , in a deliberate analogy to flares in the lower solar corona .",
    "some fraction of this energy is deposited into electrons which end up in a thermal distribution .",
    "the remaining energy would then be used to accelerate particles ( mostly electrons ) to high energies .",
    "a key parameter is the fraction of energy that is funneled into the non - thermal particles for a given event .",
    "unfortunately , as is discussed below , that number is not well constrained .",
    "x - ray observations have shown that , in the accretion disk environment , the newly energized coronal particles give up their energy to the soft x - ray / uv photons from the accretion disk .",
    "this results in the standard hard x - ray comptonized power - law that is the hallmark of these sources .",
    "the very hard x - ray tails observed in the spectra of cyg  x-1 and grs  1915 + 105 show that the non - thermal particles are involved in this process .",
    "the results of   [ sub : eres ] have shown that for electrons to be an important contributor to fe  k@xmath0  production then @xmath110@xmath3 times more energy has to be deposited into the disk by particles then by the comptonized photons .",
    "for this scenario to be viable , most of the electrons in the corona would have to not lose their energy to comptonization , implying a very low compton @xmath111 parameter .",
    "however , the observed photon - indices and high energy cutoffs show that @xmath112 in most of these systems @xcite ; therefore , comptonization is important . alternatively , due to outflows in the corona ,",
    "the hard x - rays may be beamed away from the disk resulting in a very small radiation flux on the surface @xcite .",
    "this scenario is also unlikely , as particles would have to be both outflowing ( to beam the hard x - rays away from the disk ) and streaming toward the disk to generate the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "furthermore , the compton reflection hump seen in many seyfert  1s show that roughly half the observed x - ray flux must be intercepted by optically thick material .",
    "perhaps a more fundamental problem with a very strong particle flux on the disk surface , is that @xmath113% of the incident energy goes into heat and not radiation @xcite .",
    "this would lead to a strong expansion of the surface layers and perhaps lead to evaporation , as is envisaged in the proton - illuminated disks @xcite , which would certainly affect the observed optically - thick signatures such as the compton - reflection bump .    on the other hand ,",
    "the non - thermal particles are likely to be tied to the magnetic field lines in the corona .",
    "thus , there may be a large particle flux at the position of the magnetic footpoints on the surface of the accretion disk . in these very local positions",
    ", the electron flux may be much higher than the radiation flux and fe  k@xmath0  may be dominated by the electron impact process .",
    "indeed , such bright spots are seen on the surface of the sun as sources of hard x - rays @xcite",
    ". however , such small regions are unlikely to be detected amidst the unresolved accretion disk emission .",
    "the dominance of the comptonized hard x - ray power - law in the spectra of accreting black holes implies that the acceleration of non - thermal particles in the corona is not highly efficient .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the above results on fe  k@xmath0  production by electron impact .",
    "the mechanism by which electrons are accelerated to large kinetic energies in accretion disk coronae is not known .",
    "again , one can look to the solar corona for guidance , where there are three different processes that are considered to be viable candidates ( see @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the first is stochastic acceleration by mhd waves in the coronal plasma which are excited by the reconnection events .",
    "the second is shock acceleration by the plasma jets produced by reconnection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is thought that the shocks are unlikely to be strong enough to account for most energetic particles ( that is , shocks may only `` pre - accelerate '' ) , although they may provide the bulk of the heat that goes into the thermal electrons @xcite .",
    "the third process is direct acceleration by large - scale electric fields , such as those found in reconnecting current sheets .",
    "the efficiency of all of these processes is , at this point , largely unknown , but numerical reconnection simulations are beginning to show that electric field acceleration may be @xmath114% efficient @xcite .    before leaving non - thermal electrons , we can use some of the basic analytical results of electric field acceleration as a consistency check of our conclusions .",
    "when thermal electrons are subjected to an external electric field they will begin to accelerate along the direction of the field , but , for most of the particles , this motion will be limited by compton drag",
    ". however , the collisional drag force on electrons decreases with the velocity , so that particles with a large enough speed can `` runaway '' and be accelerated freely by the electric field .",
    "the value of the electric field where this critical runaway velocity is equal to the thermal velocity @xmath115 of a maxwellian distribution is called the dreicer field and is given by @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the electron plasma frequency . in this situation",
    ", the bulk of the electrons in the thermal distribution will be accelerated .    in the context of solar flares",
    ", @xcite examined the properties of accelerated electrons by sub - dreicer electric fields . since the magnetic field induced by the electron beam must be less than the field in the acceleration region ( @xmath118 )",
    ", @xcite found that this limited the acceleration rate ( per area ) to a maximum of @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the length of the accelerating current sheet ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if the radiation flux on the disk is @xmath121  erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10 between 10  ev and 100  kev  @xcite , then , for a @xmath122 spectrum , this translates to @xmath123  erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10 between @xmath26 and 200  kev . for a significant fe  k@xmath0  flux due to electron impact",
    ", the energy flux due to electrons must be @xmath124  erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eplaw ] ) . converting this to a number flux using a @xmath125 spectrum , and plugging into the acceleration limit above",
    "gives an estimate of the accelerating magnetic field in the accretion disk coronae , @xmath126  g. for comparison , the equipartition magnetic field in a disk is @xmath127  g @xcite .",
    "thus , the assumptions of sub - dreicer acceleration of non - thermal particles and significant fe  k@xmath0  emission from electron impact implies an extremely strong coronal magnetic field .",
    "considerable work over the last few years has been done investigating the properties of disks which change from being cold and geometrically thin to hot and geometrically thick ( see references in ",
    "[ sect : intro ] ) .",
    "one of the greatest difficulties in describing such a model is the process by which the truncation of the cold disk occurs .",
    "a natural mechanism would be heating the disk until its local scale height becomes comparable to the radius , effectively evaporating the inner part of the disk",
    ".    once the two - phase accretion flow is operating , @xcite showed that protons in the hot phase striking the cold disk will be an effective mechanism for heating the disk surface .",
    "comptonization of the soft disk photons by this heated layer produced a hard x - ray spectrum not too dissimilar from what is observed . in ",
    "[ sub : pres ] we found that virialized protons are a highly inefficient way of producing fe  k@xmath0emission .",
    "thus , external hard x - ray radiation will need to be included in the models of truncated accretion flows to explain any fe  k emission . in the context of the proton illumination model",
    ", it may be possible to determine the relative importance of radiation heating to proton heating by examining the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "the above sections have shown that it is difficult for particle impact to be an efficient producer of fe  k@xmath0  lines , because most of incoming energy is used to heat the gas and not for ionizing iron .",
    "thus , this process will only be important in environments where photons are not as efficiently produced as high energy particles .",
    "while detailed calculations are beyond the scope of this paper , non - thermal radio sources or jet - like flows , where the bulk of the energy may be transported by relativistic particles , may be areas where particle impact is the dominant source of ionization .",
    "the shock front in a gamma - ray burst is another possible area of application if there are enough high energy baryons in the relativistic outflow .",
    "just like a photon , high energy electrons and protons can eject a k - shell electron from iron and produce a k@xmath0 line photon if their kinetic energy is @xmath128  kev . in this paper",
    "we have considered the possible role of particle impact in the generation of fe  k@xmath0  emission from accreting black holes .",
    "calculations of fe  k@xmath0  flux from various columns of gas were performed when it was bombarded by a non - thermal power - law of electrons , or a thermal distribution of electrons or protons . this flux",
    "was then compared with that produced by a power - law of radiation under the assumption that all process deposited roughly 1  erg  @xmath9  s@xmath10 of energy into the material .",
    "it was found that in every circumstance the fe  k@xmath0  flux produced by particle impact was @xmath1% of that produced by photoionization .",
    "a more realistic calculation which relaxes the optically - thin assumption made here would find an even smaller ratio .    increasing the electron flux on the accretion disk in order to produce more k@xmath0 emission was inconsistent with the standard disk - corona model for accretion disk emission . in the case of a disk illuminated by virialized protons ,",
    "as might be found in a truncated accretion disk model , we found a very low efficiency for fe  k@xmath0production .",
    "therefore , these type of models must consider external x - ray illumination to explain any observed k@xmath0 line .    to conclude",
    ", we find that , except for isolated regions around magnetic footpoints , it is unlikely that particle impact can significantly contribute to the observed x - ray line ( or continuum ) emission from accreting black holes .",
    "depending on the efficiency of the unknown acceleration mechanisms , particles may , however , be a important heating source for accretion disks .",

    "acf thanks the royal society for support .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful comments .",
    "in the interests of generality , we show in figure  [ fig : flx ] the unnormalized fe  k@xmath0  line fluxes ( in photons  @xmath9  s@xmath10 ) obtained from equations  [ eq : flx - ei ] and [ eq : flx - pi ] for the power - law and thermal spectral shapes used in   [ sect : res ] .",
    "the standard values of @xmath129 and @xmath130 from @xcite were used , and the solar fe abundance of @xmath131 from @xcite was assumed . as the fe abundance is just a multiplicative factor ,",
    "the results can be easily scaled to other metallicities . finally , the particle spectra were normalized as in   [ sect : res ] ; that is , the electron spectra has a energy flux between 7.112  kev  and 200  kev  of 1  kev  @xmath9  s@xmath10 , while the protons have a total energy flux of 1  kev  @xmath9  s@xmath10 .",
