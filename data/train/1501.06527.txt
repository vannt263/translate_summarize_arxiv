    "a crucial prediction of qed in external potentials is the production of electron - positron pairs in sufficiently strong electric fields @xcite , the so - called _ schwinger effect_. this is a non - perturbative effect which is exponentially suppressed for field strengths below the critical field strength @xmath0 .",
    "hence , it seems unrealistic to test it with static fields .",
    "more promising are high intensity lasers , cf .  the reviews @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , even the projected high intensity laser facilities may not reach this non - perturbative regime .",
    "one possibility to overcome this is to use complicated field configurations , such as in the dynamically assisted schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "often , such configurations can only be treated numerically .",
    "one framework for this is the quantum kinetic equation ( qke ) @xcite , where one defines quasi - particle number densities at intermediate times and obtains the asymptotic particle number by solving an ordinary differential equation for their time evolution .",
    "it was noticed @xcite , that the quasi - particle numbers , as defined in this framework , can be much larger at intermediate times than at asymptotically late times ( for parameters typical for an optical laser setting , the proportionality was @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is problematic in numerical studies , as the errors that are made at intermediate times , where the number densities are high , are propagated to asymptotic times , where they can dominate the actual number densities .",
    "now the concept of a particle is ambiguous at intermediate times , where the external potential is non - vanishing and varying ; consequently , one speaks of _ quasi - particles_. one may thus wonder how generic the occurrence of enhanced quasi - particle densities at intermediate times is . or more generally : consider any formalism in which particle creation is studied by ( numerically ) solving an evolution equation for some dynamical quantity .",
    "can one make any generic statements about the intermediate time behavior ?",
    "one possibility to investigate this is to consider a quantity that is unique and well - defined also at intermediate times . the prime candidate for this",
    "is the current density @xmath2 it is an observable , and thus , at least in principle , measurable .",
    "such a measurement would proceed via back - reaction , i.e. , by the changes in the electromagnetic field which are sourced by this current .",
    "these back - reaction effects can be used to constrain the generation of primordial electromagnetic fields during inflation @xcite . however , in the present work we are more interested in generic features of this observable and whether these may help to better understand the intermediate time behavior of the dynamical variable in the time evolution equation in which the system is studied . in particular",
    ", we will argue that the occurrence of enhanced quasi - particle numbers at intermediate times is generic , and will also indicate a new scheme which avoids these difficulties .",
    "the current density is unique in the following sense : for a locally gauge covariant definition of the current density , the only ambiguity consists in adding multiples of the external current density @xcite , corresponding to a charge renormalization .",
    "it can be fixed by requiring that for static external potentials the total vacuum polarization charge vanishes at linear order in the external potential @xcite , i.e. , the external charges are not renormalized at this order of approximation .",
    "the expectation value of the current density , henceforth also called the _ vacuum current density _ , is a crucial ingredient in the study of back - reaction effects . in the qke framework ,",
    "an expression for the vacuum current density was given in @xcite , cf .  also @xcite .",
    "in fact , the analysis of this expression will be crucial for the explanation of the enhanced quasi - particle numbers in slowly varying sub - critical potentials reported in @xcite .",
    "however , the renormalization prescription used there is not explicitly local , so it is a priori not clear whether it conforms to the requirement of local gauge covariance . it",
    "it thus desirable to check these results with independent methods .    based on dirac s method of point - splitting w.r.t .",
    "the singular part of the two - point function , we give , in section  [ sec : current ] , a general expression for the vacuum current in a homogeneous time - dependent external electric field .",
    "we show that it is equivalent to the expression derived in the qke framework .",
    "we also evaluate it for the concrete case of the so - called sauter pulse , @xmath3 both for super- and sub - critical peak field strengths @xmath4 .",
    "this external field was studied extensively in the literature , with an emphasis on the asymptotic behavior , i.e. , the pair production probability , which was first computed by narozhnyi and nikishov @xcite .",
    "the intermediate time behavior of the quasi - particle number in this system was studied in @xcite , using the quantum kinetic equation @xcite .",
    "our results for the sauter pulse agree well with the asymptotic pair production probabilities derived in @xcite .",
    "we also recall , in section  [ sec : linearization ] , that there is a general expression for the vacuum current density at linear order in the external potential , due to serber @xcite .",
    "however , his derivation contains some mistakes , leading to an incorrect result , which we correct here . for sub - critical peak field strengths , the application of this general expression to",
    "the sauter pulse leads to a nice agreement with the results obtained by our new method",
    ". one interesting feature of serber s general expression is that , at the linear order , the vacuum current only depends on the external current , not on the field strength .",
    "we remark that the study of generic properties of the current density does not seem to have attracted a lot of attention in the literature .",
    "usually , the current density is considered in the context of back - reaction , with an emphasis on directly including these effects in the quantum evolution equation @xcite . for a work where the vacuum current was computed independently of back - reaction",
    ", we refer to @xcite .    finally , in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we turn to the discussion of the enhanced quasi - particle numbers reported in @xcite for slowly varying sub - critical potentials . for the adiabatic basis",
    "usually considered , this turns out to be a straightforward consequence of the expression for the vacuum current density in terms of the quasi - particle density .",
    "we argue that this is indeed a generic feature .",
    "also a new framework , based on dirac s point splitting method , is sketched , in which these problems should be absent , and which is in principle also applicable for generic external fields .",
    "for the computation of the vacuum current density we use dirac s method @xcite of point - splitting w.r.t .  the singular part of the two - point function @xmath5 , the so - called _ hadamard parametrix _ @xmath6 , cf .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "this method is conceptually appealing as it is explicitly local and gauge covariant .",
    "the practical difficulty is that the hadamard parametrix is known in position space , while the two - point function is typically given by an integral over modes .",
    "the subtraction of the singular part @xmath7 from this mode integral is in general quite challenging . in @xcite",
    "a solution to this problem for the computation of the vacuum polarization in static external potentials was proposed .",
    "the idea is to consider the limit of coinciding points from the time direction and to rewrite @xmath8 ( up to a potential logarithmic singularity in @xmath9 ) in the form of an integral over ( shifted ) vacuum mode densities .",
    "the subtraction of these singular parts can thus be performed inside the mode integral , which renders it much less divergent and numerically more tractable .",
    "this method can be adapted to the case of a homogeneous external electric field along the @xmath10-axis , in the gauge @xmath11 .",
    "it is then advantageous to perform the limit of coinciding points from the @xmath10-direction .",
    "an analogous rewriting of the hadamard parametrix yields the following expression for the vacuum current : @xmath12.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is defined as follows .",
    "consider the properly normalized mode solutions @xmath14 of the dirac equation @xmath15 in the presence of the external potential , which coincide with the positive / negative energy modes at asymptotically early times ( we refer to appendix  [ app : relationqkepointsplit ] for a precise definition of the required normalization ) . here",

    "the function @xmath21 in is defined analogously , but for the standard mode solutions @xmath22 in the absence of external potentials .",
    "the corresponding term in can thus be seen as the subtraction of the vacuum contribution , with an appropriate shift in the momentum .. however , a shift @xmath23 , has to be accompanied by the replacement @xmath24 in , as the new solution to the equation of motion for the mode functions is given by @xmath25 .",
    "with the substitution @xmath26 , this results in a phase shift @xmath27 of the integral in , which is irrelevant in the limit @xmath28 . ] the third term in cancels a remaining logarithmic divergence in the presence of an external current @xmath29 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , we fix the length scale @xmath30 such that external charges are not renormalized at the linear level , i.e. , @xmath31 cf .",
    "@xcite , with @xmath32 the euler - mascheroni constant .",

    "the first term in the integrand in gives rise to the so - called _ conduction current _ , due to the movement of the quasi - particles already created .",
    "the last two terms yield the _ polarization current _ , due to the creation of quasi - particle pairs .",

    "note that , as indicated in the figure , the vacuum current density is two orders of magnitude smaller than the external one .",

    "interestingly , only depends on the external current , not on the field strength .",
    "heuristically , in time - dependent situations , the vacuum current can be thought of as the current due to a rearrangement of the uehling vacuum polarization clouds accompanying the charges that are responsible for the external current . in this sense",
    ", it is indeed a polarization current , as in the terminology of @xcite , discussed above .",
    "however , it may be misleading to attribute it to pair creation , as usually done .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : tanh01 ] , the expression describes the time - dependence of the vacuum current in the sub - critical case very well .",
    "we note that in the example shown in figure  [ fig : tanh01 ] the adiabaticity parameter @xmath56 is larger than one , indicating that the ( asymptotic ) pair production probability is dominated by multi - photon processes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the vacuum current density at intermediate times is very well described by the linear approximation .",

    "distances are measured natural compton units.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the enhanced quasi - particle densities described in @xcite .",
    "there , a slowly varying sub - critical electric field @xmath63 is considered , which is turned on and off at some finite times . at first sight",
    ", one might think that the explanation lies in the fact that for sub - critical electric fields the vacuum current density at intermediate times is dominated by the linearization , which is known to vanish at asymptotic times .",
    "a first indication that this reasoning is flawed is the fact that one may well have non - vanishing particle densities at asymptotic times in spite of a vanishing vacuum current . as we will see , a satisfactory explanation of the enhanced quasi - particle densities at intermediate times has to take the logarithmic divergence of the current into account .",
    "we recall that the third term in is a counterterm which is necessary to cancel a logarithmic divergence in the polarization current , i.e. , the integral over the second term in .",
    "it follows that for large momentum @xmath16 the rate of the change of the quasi - particle density is given by . ]",
    "@xmath64 for slowly varying sub - critical external fields , one expects that this yields the main contribution to the rate of change of the total quasi - particle density .",
    "performing the momentum integral over the fraction on the r.h.s .  and",
    "integrating in time , this implies @xmath65 up to a factor @xmath66 , which seems to have been interpreted as @xmath67 , this agrees with the heuristic description of the numerical results found in @xcite for a sinusoidal time - dependence of the background electric field .",
    "the expectation can also be verified for slow sub - critical sauter pulses , using the quasi - particle number density from @xcite , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : particlenumber ] . in this sense ,",
    "the enhanced quasi - particle densities reported in @xcite are primarily due to the fact that the dynamical variables chosen in the qke framework are such that a supplementary counterterm is necessary in the expression for the vacuum current density , i.e. , that @xmath68 is much larger than it would need to be in order to yield the correct vacuum current density .    , @xmath69 , @xmath70.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    a strategy to circumvent the problem of greatly enhanced particle number densities would thus be to find dynamical variables for which no further renormalization is necessary in the computation of the current density .",
    "one possibility would be to consider better adapted modes for the definition of quasi - particle densities , perhaps similar to those discussed in @xcite for the charged scalar field .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that this is possible : we know that the @xmath71 function of qed does not vanish , so there must be a logarithmic divergence in the current , proportional to the external current @xmath72 ( a change @xmath73 corresponds to a charge renormalization ) .",
    "hence , for any definition of quasi - particle densities , one expects a logarithmic divergence proportional to @xmath74 in the corresponding expression for the vacuum current .",
    "instead , one might proceed as follows : the essence of dirac s procedure is to subtract from the two - point function @xmath5 its singular part @xmath75 , the hadamard parametrix .",
    "the result @xmath76 is smooth , so that the limit of coinciding points may be performed , for example in the computation of the expectation value of the current density or the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the idea would be to solve the differential equation for the smooth remainder @xmath77 , , similarly to the wigner function framework @xcite . ]",
    "i.e. , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the transpose of @xmath80 ( acting on a co - spinor ) , applied on the primed variable .",
    "here we used that the two - point function is a bi - solution to the dirac equation .",
    "in contrast , the parametrix is not a bi - solution , but there are smooth remainders which appear as source terms on the right hand side . these remainders are given @xcite as a series in the hadamard coefficients @xmath81 ( the lorentzian analogues of the heat kernel coefficients ) for the wave operator @xmath82 instead of a linear differential equation for the bogoliubov coefficients , one thus has to solve an inhomogeneous one for the remainder @xmath77 .",
    "the renormalization ambiguity of the current is now hidden in the initial condition for @xmath77 ( choosing @xmath83 in the past amounts to heisenberg s renormalization condition ) . the vacuum current density @xmath84",
    "is simply given by @xmath85 , i.e. , no further renormalization is necessary .",
    "for the solution @xmath77 one would thus expect that the magnitude at intermediate times is of the same order as asymptotically . once the background field is switched off , and hence @xmath7 equals the vacuum two - point function",
    ", one can read off the particle content directly from the fourier transform of @xmath77 .",
    "a nice feature of this scheme is that , due to the initial condition @xmath86 , all pair creation effects are due to the inhomogeneous part on the r.h.s .  of .",
    "hence , it may be possible to make statements about pair creation without actually solving the differential equations .",
    "that appear on the r.h.s .  of are recursively defined by an inhomogeneous ode , cf .",
    "@xcite for details . ]",
    "a further advantage of the framework is that it is in principle applicable to generic external potentials , in contrast to the qke , which requires a homogeneous , purely electric field .",
    "on the other hand , there are obvious difficulties : the construction of @xmath7 involves a series @xmath87 which is only guaranteed to converge for analytic external fields . in practice , one would probably truncate the series , so that @xmath77 is not smooth ( but @xmath88 for arbitrarily large @xmath43 ) .",
    "this potentially leads to problems at large distances , so it might be necessary to include an infrared cut - off in the definition of @xmath7 . a further difficulty lies in the fact that the hadamard coefficients @xmath89 are not known explicitly to all orders ( however , for very symmetric external fields it could be possible to fully determine them ) . in view of the potential benefits , we consider it worthwhile to try to overcome these difficulties .",
    "we remark that the strategy proposed above is quite similar to the modified equal time wigner function formalism used in ( * ? ? ?",
    "there , one subtracts from the two - point function not the hadamard parametrix , but the vacuum two - point function , multiplied by a parallel transport .",
    "this may be appropriate in the 1 + 1 dimensional setting considered there , as the remainder is continuous ( though not continuously differentiable ) for equal times .",
    "however , it easily follows from the results in @xcite , that in 3 + 1 dimensions the remainder would not be continuous . in particular ,",
    "the logarithmic divergence that is responsible for the charge renormalization ambiguity is not canceled , so one expects the problems with greatly enhanced values at intermediate times to persist .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced a method to compute the expectation value of the current density in qed in external time - dependent potentials at intermediate times , based on a point - splitting renormalization .",
    "we showed that it is equivalent to the expression for the current density derived in the qke framework @xcite .",
    "we also corrected an expression due to serber for the linearization of the vacuum current density in the external potential .",
    "our non - perturbative results for the sauter pulse are compatible both with the corrected version of serber s general expression in the case of a sub - critical peak field strength and with the asymptotic results of narozhnyi and nikishov @xcite .",
    "we proposed a natural explanation of the enhanced quasi - particle densities at intermediate times for slowly varying sub - critical homogeneous electric fields @xcite .",
    "the argument used the fact that the current is completely fixed up to the charge renormalization ambiguity .",
    "we also sketched a framework in which no difference of scales of the dynamical quantity at intermediate and asymptotic times is to be expected , and which is in principle applicable to generic external potentials .",
