    "one of the aims of the present lhc experiments is the exploration of the scalar sector of particle physics .",
    "indeed , one scalar particle was already found in brilliant experiments @xcite .",
    "but it is not clear if nature corresponds to the standard model ( sm ) where we have only one physical higgs boson .",
    "many models with extended scalar sectors exist in the literature .",
    "an attractive alternative to the sm are two - higgs - doublet models , thdms ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in our group we emphasised the usefulness of bilinears for the study of thdms @xcite .",
    "a thdm with maximal cp symmetry has been presented in @xcite .",
    "this model , the _ maximal cp symmetric model _ ,",
    "mcpm , gives a certain understanding of family replication and fermion mass hierarchies .",
    "phenomenological consequences of the mcpm were worked out in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we continue the phenomenological investigations of the mcpm in view of the possibilities of the experiments at lhc13 .",
    "we shall , in particular , be interested in two - photon production in proton - proton collisions .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec - mcpm ]",
    "we briefly review some features of the mcpm . in section [ sec - pp2ggx ]",
    "we present the details of the calculation of diphoton production in proton - proton collisions .",
    "section [ sec - discussion ] contains our discussion and section [ sec - conclusions ] our conclusions .",
    "in this section we recall briefly some main features of the mcpm . like in any two - higgs - doublet model",
    "there are five physical higgs bosons , in our notation , @xmath6 , @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath6 behaves on its mass shell very similarly to the sm higgs boson which we denote by @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we set for the mass of the @xmath6 the measured value from @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 the masses of the charged higgs - boson pair , @xmath0 , of the pseudoscalar @xmath7 and of the scalar @xmath8 are not predicted by the model except that the hierarchy @xmath11 is required .",
    "the model is built to have the generalised cp symmetry of type ( i ) , see @xcite , and this has drastic consequences .",
    "the couplings of the higgs bosons among themselves are determined in terms of the masses .",
    "furthermore , in the strict symmetry limit and concerning the yukawa couplings , the third fermion family couples exclusively to the @xmath6 , the second family only to @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , but with coupling constants related to the third family .",
    "the first family of fermions is uncoupled to the higgs sector in this limit where the masses of the second and first - family fermions are zero .",
    "of course , this is not realistic , but it is not so bad as a first approximation to nature ; see @xcite . in the following",
    "we will work in this strict symmetry limit .",
    "thus , all relations are subject to corrections from symmetry breaking . but in this paper we are interested in the physics of the higgs bosons of the mcpm , that is , physics at the 100 to 800 gev scale .",
    "we expect that symmetry breaking corrections due to the non - zero masses of the first and second fermion family will be small in this regime .",
    "the lagrangian of the mcpm is given explicitly in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "diphoton production in proton - proton collision via an intermediate virtual higgs boson @xmath13 . ]    in the following we shall study the reaction of two protons , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , giving a pair of photons , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , via an intermediate virtual higgs boson @xmath18 , and a rest @xmath19 , see fig . [ pp2gg ] , @xmath20 here the momentum and polarization vectors are indicated in brackets .",
    "the @xmath21-matrix element for this process is @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 the mass and width of the higgs boson @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the invariant mass squared of the photon pair and the square of the center - of - mass collision energy are defined as usual , @xmath26 for unpolarized protons as well as unobserved polarizations of the photons we find the cross section @xmath27 now we define the production cross section for the virtual higgs boson @xmath28 @xmath29 we define the decay width of the virtual boson @xmath28 of mass squared @xmath30 as @xmath31 with this we have for the cross sections @xmath32 and @xmath33      the couplings of the higgs boson @xmath6 to the gauge bosons and fermions of the third generation are like those for the sm higgs boson @xmath34 . for the production reaction @xmath35",
    "we have , therefore , the following main processes :    * gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath36 * vector - boson fusion , @xmath37 * fusion of @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks , @xmath40    therefore , the production cross section can be calculated as for a sm higgs boson @xmath34 of mass @xmath41 but we have to leave out very small contributions to @xmath34 production from the annihilation of first and second generation quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "all this has already been discussed in @xcite and we can thus rely on the results presented there for the cross section .      for the decay of the virtual higgs boson @xmath28 to two photons we have in the mcpm contributions from fermion loops , @xmath43-boson loops , and @xmath0 loops .",

    "we expect to find discrete eigenvalues @xmath81 for @xmath82 labeled by @xmath83 and possibly a degeneracy index @xmath84 .",
    "we normalise the eigenfunctions to @xmath85 for energies greater or equal to zero we will get a continuous spectrum @xmath86 here , again , @xmath84 is a possible degeneracy label and we normalise the eigenfunctions to @xmath87 we have then the completeness relation @xmath88 the green s function @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 formally the amplitude corresponding to the diagram of fig .",
    "[ hthreshold ] is given by @xmath91 a result which is , however , divergent if we extend the integration over @xmath92 in up to infinity .",
    "but this is not justified since we have to restrict all energies to be in absolute value much small than @xmath93 , the threshold energy .",
    "thus , we introduce a cutoff parameter @xmath94 with @xmath95 and extend the integral in only up to @xmath96 .",
    "we get then from and to @xmath97 note that only the s waves contribute here since we evaluate the green s function for @xmath98 .    in order to obtain an ( approximate ) complete result for @xmath73 via the @xmath99 loops we can not simply add @xmath100 , , and @xmath101 , .",
    "this would imply a double counting of the threshold region .",
    "we shall thus subtract from @xmath101 the contribution from the threshold region . from the properties of @xmath101 we see that it satisfies an unsubtracted dispersion relation @xmath102 with @xmath103",
    "we choose now a function @xmath104 defined for @xmath105 with the properties @xmath106 with this function we set @xmath107 and @xmath108 we set for the complete contribution of the @xmath0 loops to the function @xmath46 in @xmath109 by construction @xmath110 cancels out the threshold contribution of @xmath101 . in practical calculations",
    "we shall choose the function @xmath111 such that @xmath112 has a smooth behaviour in the transition region from threshold to continuuum .",
    "putting everything together we have for the function @xmath46 of from , , and @xmath113 the decay width of the virtual particle @xmath28 is then @xmath114 discussion ----------    looking at the result for @xmath73 from the @xmath99 loop in the threshold region we see that it corresponds to a superposition of resonance contributions .",
    "the positions of the resonances are approximately at @xmath115 , the widths are @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the mcpm predicts such a type of resonance structure in the @xmath1 spectrum . to give a concrete example we shall now choose the mass of @xmath0 to be @xmath117 then , we get from section 3.1 of @xcite that the main fermionic decays of @xmath0 are @xmath118 giving a decay rate ( see table 3 of @xcite ) @xmath119 the decays @xmath120 can occur in the mcpm if they are energetically possible .",
    "but , as we will argue below , even then their contribution to the total width of @xmath0 should be small .",
    "thus , the best estimate for the total width of @xmath0 of mass is @xmath121 the branching fraction of @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) is then estimated to be ( see ( 3.25 ) of @xcite ) @xmath124 with such a charged higgs - boson pair @xmath0 and @xmath6 with masses given in and , respectively , we get a rather strong attractive potential with @xmath125 thus , due to this potential , the mcpm predicts a resonance structure in the @xmath1 channel at @xmath126 with a width @xmath127    we note now that the atlas and cms collaborations have indeed reported preliminary evidence for a sort of resonance structure at @xmath128 gev with a width of the order of 45 gev ; see @xcite . of course",
    ", we must be very careful and can not yet identify the resonance structures discussed in section [ sec - pp2ggx ] of this paper with this possible experimental finding . in any case , we shall have to make a numerical study of the predicted effect .",
    "we shall do this in a separate paper . here",
    "we shall only draw some conclusions based on the _ hypothesis _ that indeed the structure in the @xmath1 spectrum at @xmath129 750 gev is real and that it has something to do with the here discussed threshold effects .",
    "the immediate consequence of the above hypothesis is that there should be a charged higgs - boson pair @xmath0 at roughly @xmath130 with the decay properties discussed in @xcite and summarised in - here .",
    "we can also say something on the masses of the pseudoscalar ( @xmath7 ) and the scalar ( @xmath8 ) higgs bosons of the mcpm .",
    "for this we adapt the analysis of the oblique parameters @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 done in @xcite for the case @xmath134 , @xmath135 ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) . the resulting range for @xmath136 versus @xmath137 is shown in fig",

    "the dark and bright regions correspond to the @xmath138 and @xmath139 uncertainties , respectively . ]",
    "we see that in the mcpm the masses @xmath136 and @xmath137 are predicted to be of the same order , if not higher , than @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the decays should play no role for this mass constellation .",

    "in this article we have discussed the reaction @xmath147 in the mcpm .",
