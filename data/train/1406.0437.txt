    "since markowitz ( 1952 ) presented his seminal work about portfolio selection , this topic has become a very fast growing branch of finance .",
    "one of markowitz s ideas was the minimization of the portfolio variance subject to the budget constraint .",
    "this approach leads to the well - known and frequently used portfolio , the global minimum variance portfolio ( gmv ) .",
    "there is a great amount of papers dealing with the gmv portfolio ( see , e.g. , jagannathan and ma ( 2003 ) , ledoit and wolf ( 2003 ) , okhrin and schmid ( 2006 ) , kempf and memmel ( 2006 ) , bodnar and schmid ( 2008 ) , frahm and memmel ( 2010 ) among others ) .",
    "we remind that the gmv portfolio is the unique solution of the following optimization problem @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the vector of portfolio weights , @xmath10 is a suitable vector of ones , and @xmath11 stands for the covariance matrix of the asset returns . note that in our paper @xmath0 is a function of the sample size @xmath1 and thus the covariance matrix depends on @xmath1 as well .",
    "this is shown by the index @xmath1 .",
    "the solution of ( [ vmin ] ) is given by @xmath12 the gmv portfolio ( [ gmv ] ) has the smallest variance over all portfolios .",
    "it is also used in multi - period portfolio choice problems ( see , e.g. , brandt ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "although this portfolio possesses several nice theoretical properties , some problems arise when the uncertainty about the parameters of the asset return distribution is taken into account .",
    "indeed , we do not know the population covariance matrix in practice and , thus , it has to be suitably estimated .",
    "consequently , the estimation of the gmv portfolio is strongly connected with the estimation of the covariance matrix of the asset returns .",
    "the traditional estimator is a commonly used possibility for the estimation of the gmv portfolio ( [ gmv ] ) .",
    "this traditional estimator is constructed by replacing in ( [ gmv ] ) the covariance matrix @xmath11 by its sample counterpart @xmath13 .",
    "okhrin and schmid ( 2006 ) derived the distribution of the traditional estimator and studied its properties under the assumption that the asset returns follow a multivariate normal distribution , whereas kempf and memmel ( 2006 ) analyzed its conditional distributional properties .",
    "furthermore , bodnar and schmid ( 2009 ) derived the distribution of the main characteristics of the sample gmv portfolio , namely its variance and its expected return .",
    "the traditional estimator is not a bad choice if the number of assets @xmath0 is fixed and it is significantly smaller than the number of observations @xmath1 in the sample .",
    "this case is often used in statistics and it is called standard asymptotics ( see , le cam and yang ( 2000 ) ) . in that case",
    "the traditional estimator is a consistent estimator for the gmv portfolio and it is asymptotically normally distributed ( okhrin and schmid ( 2006 ) ) . as a result , for a small fixed dimension @xmath14 we can use the sample estimator but it is not fully clear what to do if the number of assets in the portfolio is extremely large , say @xmath15 , comparable to @xmath1 .",
    "here we are in the situation when both the number of assets @xmath0 and the sample size @xmath1 tend to infinity .",
    "this double asymptotics has an interpretation when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are of comparable size .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath16 tends to a concentration ratio @xmath17 . this type of asymptotics is known as high - dimensional asymptotics or `` kolmogorov '' asymptotics ( see , bai and silverstein ( 2010 ) ) . under the high - dimensional asymptotics",
    "the traditional estimator behaves very unpredictable and it is far from the optimum one .",
    "it tends to underestimate the risk ( see , el karoui ( 2010 ) , bai and shi ( 2011 ) ) . in general , the traditional estimator is worse for larger values of the concentration ratio @xmath18 . imposing the assumption of a factor structure on the asset returns this problem was resolved in an efficient way by bai ( 2003 ) , fan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , fan et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , fan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , etc .",
    "nevertheless , if the factor structure is not present the question of high - dimensionality remains open .",
    "further estimators for the weights of the gmv portfolio have been proposed in this situation .",
    "demiguel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested to involve some additional portfolio constraints in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality . on the other hand ,",
    "shrinkage estimators can be used which are biased but can significantly reduce the risk of the portfolio by minimizing its mean - square error .",
    "the general shrinkage estimator is a convex combination of the traditional estimator and a known target ( for the gmv portfolio it can be the naive equally weighted portfolio ) .",
    "they were first considered by stein ( 1956 ) .",
    "recently , various authors showed that shrinkage estimators for the portfolio weights indeed lead to better results ( see , e.g. , golosnoy and okhrin ( 2007 ) , frahm and memmel ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "in particular , golosnoy and okhrin ( 2007 ) considered a multivariate shrinkage estimator by shrinking the portfolio weights themselves but not the whole sample covariance matrix .",
    "the same idea was used by frahm and memmel ( 2010 ) who constructed a feasible shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio which dominates the traditional one .",
    "there are several problems with these estimators : first , the normal distribution is usually imposed ; second , dominating does not mean optimal ; and third , the large dimensional behavior ( large @xmath0 and large @xmath1 ) seems not to be acceptable .",
    "the aim of the paper is to derive a feasible and simple estimator for the gmv portfolio which is optimal , in some sense , for small and large sample sizes and which is distribution - free as well .",
    "for that purpose we construct an optimal shrinkage estimator , study its asymptotic properties and estimate unknown quantities consistently .",
    "the estimator is obtained using random matrix theory , a fast growing branch of probability theory .",
    "the main result of this theory was proved by mar@xmath19enko and pastur ( 1967 ) and further extended under very general conditions by silverstein ( 1995 ) .",
    "nowadays it is called mar@xmath19enko - pastur equation .",
    "its importance arises in many areas of science because it shows how the real covariance matrix and its sample estimate are connected with each other . knowing this information we can build suitable estimators for high - dimensional quantities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present a shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio which is optimal in terms of minimizing the out - of - sample variance .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the resulting shrinkage intensity is investigated for @xmath20 in section 2.1 and in case of @xmath21 in section 2.2 where it is shown that the shrinkage intensity tends almost surely to a deterministic quantity when both the sample size and the portfolio dimension increase .",
    "this result allows us to determine an oracle estimator of the gmv portfolio , while the corresponding bona fide estimator is presented in section 2.3 . in section 3",
    "we provide a simulation study for different values of @xmath22 and under various distributional assumptions imposed on the data generating process . here",
    ", the performance and the convergence rate of the derived shrinkage estimator are compared with existing estimators of the gmv portfolio .",
    "the results of our empirical study are given in section 4 where we apply the suggested estimator as well as the existing estimators to real data consisting of returns on assets included in the s&p 500 ( standard & poor s 500 ) index .",
    "section 5 summarizes all of the obtained results .",
    "the lengthy proofs are moved to the appendix ( section 6 ) .",
    "let @xmath23 be the @xmath24 data matrix which consists of @xmath1 vectors of the returns on @xmath25 assets .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "this type of limiting behavior is also denoted as `` large dimensional asymptotics '' or `` the kolmogorov asymptotics '' . in this case",
    "the traditional estimators perform poor or even very poor and tend to over / underestimate the unknown parameters of the asset returns , i.e. , the mean vector and the covariance matrix .    throughout the paper it is assumed that it exists a @xmath31 random matrix @xmath32 which consists of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "real random variables with zero mean and unit variance such that @xmath33 it is noted that the observation matrix @xmath34 consists of dependent rows although its columns are independent .",
    "the assumption of the independence of the columns can further be weakened by controlling the growth of the number of dependent entries , while no specific distributional assumptions are imposed on the elements of @xmath34 ( see , friesen et al.(2013 ) ) .",
    "the two main assumptions which are used throughout the paper are    1 .",
    "the covariance matrix of the asset returns @xmath11 is a nonrandom @xmath0-dimensional positive definite matrix .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath32 have uniformly bounded @xmath35 moments for some @xmath36 .",
    "these two regularity conditions are very general and they fit many practical situations .",
    "the assumption ( a1 ) is common for financial and statistical problems . it does not impose a strong restriction on the data - generating process , whereas the assumption ( a2 ) is purely technical",
    "moreover , it seems to influence only the convergence rate of the proposed estimator ( see , e.g. rubio et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ) .",
    "+ the sample covariance matrix is given by @xmath37 where the symbol @xmath38 stands for the identity matrix of an appropriate dimension .",
    "the traditional estimator for the gmv portfolio is obtained by replacing the unknown population covariance matrix @xmath11 in by the estimator .",
    "this leads to @xmath39    next , we derive the optimal shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio weights by optimizing with respect to the shrinkage parameter @xmath40 and fixing some target portfolio @xmath41 .",
    "its distributional properties are studied after that .",
    "the general shrinkage estimator ( gse ) for @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a given nonrandom ( or random but independent of the actual observation vector @xmath45 , i.e. , the last column of @xmath34 ) vector .",
    "no assumption is imposed on the shrinkage intensity @xmath40 which is the object of our interest .",
    "the aim is to find the optimal shrinkage intensity @xmath40 .",
    "for a given target portfolio @xmath41 which minimizes the out - of - sample risk +    @xmath46    ( see , e.g. , frahm and memmel ( 2010 ) , rubio et al .",
    "( 2012 ) ) .",
    "the loss function ( [ risk ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the population variance of the gmv portfolio and @xmath49 is known as the out - of - sample variance of the portfolio with the weights @xmath50 .    using ( [ gse ] )",
    "we want to solve the following optimization problem @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the out - of - sample variance of the traditional estimator for the gmv portfolio weights . taking the derivative of @xmath53 with respect to @xmath40 and setting it equal to zero",

    "theorem [ th1 ] provides us important information about the optimal shrinkage estimator of the gmv portfolio .",
    "especially , the application of theorem [ th1 ] immediately leads to consistent estimators for @xmath59 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 which are presented in section 2.3 below .",
    "it is remarkable to note that the assumption @xmath72 is natural for financial markets .",
    "it ensures that the population variance of the gmv portfolio has a lower bound which is in - line with the capital asset pricing model since the portfolio variance can not be smaller than the market risk ( see , e.g. , elton et al .",
    "( 2007 , chapter 7 ) ) . moreover , the assumption of the boundedness of the variance of the target portfolio @xmath73 is also well acceptable because it makes no sense to shrink to a portfolio with infinite variance .",
    "most importantly , this condition also holds even if the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix is unbounded .",
    "such a situation is present if the asset returns follow a factor model which is a very popular approach in financial literature nowadays ( see , e.g. , fan et al .",

    "it is worth pointing out that the same result is true if we assume instead of @xmath74 the boundedness of the spectral norm of the population covariance matrix , i.e. , the uniformly bounded maximum eigenvalue of @xmath11 .",

    "moreover , its first part generalizes the result of frahm and memmel ( 2010 , theorem 7 ) to an arbitrary distribution of the asset returns . using corollary [ cor1](a ) we can plot the behavior of the relative loss of the traditional estimator for the gmv portfolio as a function of the concentration ratio @xmath18 only , while the relative loss of the optimal shrinkage portfolio additionally depends on the relative loss of the target portfolio .",
    "furthermore , from both parts of corollary [ cor1 ] we get @xmath77 i.e. , the relative loss of the optimal shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio can asymptotically be presented as a linear combination of the relative loss of the traditional estimator and the relative loss of the target portfolio . because @xmath78 as @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the left and right limits to the point @xmath81 , respectively . ] and @xmath82 we get that @xmath83 as @xmath79 , whereas the relative loss of the traditional estimator tends to infinity .",

    "the results are presented in both cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as for the covariance matrix with bounded ( section 3.1 ) and unbounded ( section 3.2 ) spectrum .    the benchmark estimator is the dominating estimator of the gmv portfolio suggested by frahm and memmel ( 2010 ) .",

    "figure [ fig:6 ] presents the _ global _ behavior of the considered estimators for different dimensions @xmath0 , while figure [ fig:7 ] shows the _ local _ distributional properties for a value of fixed @xmath177 .",
    "more precisely , under the _ global _ behavior we understand the evolution of the average relative loss with respect to the dimension @xmath0 and the _ local _ behavior presents the empirical cumulative distribution functions ( e.c.d.f . ) of the relative loss for one fixed value of @xmath0 , namely @xmath177 .",
    "the comparison in case of _ global _ setting is clear : the smaller the average loss the better is the estimator .",
    "the _ local _ study provides a more precise comparison in terms of the empirical distributions . in this case , the criterion of the best estimator is based on the observation that the e.c.d.f . with",

    "for instance , in case of @xmath180 , the average relative loss of the traditional estimator tends to @xmath146 , whereas it tends to @xmath81 for @xmath181 .",
    "these two results are in line with corollary [ cor1 ] , where it is proved that the average loss of the traditional estimator tends to @xmath182 under high - dimensional asymptotics . in case of @xmath183 ,",
    "the difference between the average relative loss of the optimal shrinkage estimator and the dominating ( traditional ) estimators becomes very large .",
    "indeed , in this case the traditional estimator has an average relative loss which is asymptotically equal to @xmath184 .",
    "this means that the out - of - sample risk of the traditional estimator is @xmath150 times larger than the real risk .",
    "the dominating estimator clearly overperforms the traditional one but the relative loss is close to @xmath122 for small dimensions ( @xmath185 ) which means that its out - of - sample risk is @xmath149 times as large as the real risk .",
    "this is not acceptable anymore .",
    "in contrast , the _ bona fide _ optimal shrinkage estimator converges fast to its _ oracle _ one .",
    "the relative loss of the optimal shrinkage estimator is smaller than @xmath186 .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows the same dominance in terms of the empirical distribution functions for a local analysis in the case @xmath177 .",
    "the best approaches are the _ oracle _ and the _ bona fide _ optimal shrinkage estimators .",

    "the local analysis for @xmath177 confirms the almost sure convergence ( consistence ) of the _ bona fide _ optimal shrinkage estimator which is proved in theorem [ th1 ] . in figure [ fig:7 ]",
    "the relative risk of both the bona fide and the oracle optimal shrinkage estimators possesses a very small variance which vanishes when the dimension @xmath0 increases . at the same time , the dominating estimator possesses a significantly larger variance and it is unstable when @xmath18 is close to one .",
    "the traditional estimator shows a very crucial behavior and it is the worst one among the considered estimators .",
    "the most interesting situation is observed for @xmath187 in figures [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] which corresponds to the singular sample covariance matrix @xmath13 .",

    "the optimal shrinkage estimator dominates clearly other competitors over all @xmath176 .",
    "it is noted that the convergence rate of the _ bona fide _ optimal shrinkage estimator to its _ oracle _ is not effected by the presence of heavy tails .",
    "a similar asymptotic relative loss behavior for the optimal shrinkage estimator is established , i.e. , the average relative loss is asymptotically constant and it is smaller than @xmath89 .",
    "the traditional estimator possesses the worst behavior over all @xmath18 and @xmath0 .      in this subsection",
    "we assume that the largest eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix @xmath11 increases as @xmath188 when @xmath189 .",
    "thus , the following structure of @xmath11 is considered here , namely @xmath146 of eigenvalues equal to @xmath147 , @xmath148 equal to @xmath149 , @xmath190 equal to @xmath150 and the last eigenvalue is equal to @xmath0 .",
    "+ note that this structure corresponds to the case when a factor structure on the asset returns is imposed .",
    "the factor model can reduce significantly the number of dimensions so that the estimators do not suffer from the `` curse of dimensionality '' anymore ( see , e.g. , fan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ) .",
    "figures [ fig:10 ] to [ fig:13 ] above here    in figures [ fig:10 ] to [ fig:13 ] we present the behavior of the estimators considered in the paper in case of a covariance matrix with unbounded spectrum .",
    "it is remarkable to note that the results are not very different from those obtained in case of a covariance matrix @xmath11 with bounded spectrum .",
    "the only difference is a somewhat greater variance of the estimators . on the other hand ,",
    "the dominance behavior as well as the convergence rate of the bona fide optimal shrinkage estimator to its oracle is not effected by the largest eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix .",
    "this means that the proposed estimator is still applicable if the asset returns follow a factor model .",
    "even more , it does not lose its efficiency also in case @xmath21 .    at the end",
    ", we note that , for the sake of interest , we have also simulated the @xmath163-distribution with @xmath87 degrees of freedom for both the bounded and the unbounded spectra .",
    "this change effects only the convergence rate but not the dominance behavior . in our theoretical framework",
    "we require the existence of the @xmath122th moment but the simulation study shows that this assumption can be relaxed or conjectured to be relaxed . as a result",
    ", the proposed optimal shrinkage procedure assures the efficiency in many important practical cases and , thus , can be applied in many real life situations .",
    "nevertheless , the empirical back - testing is still needed in order to check the behavior of the derived estimator for the gmv portfolio weights on a real data set .",
    "this is done is the next section .",
    "in this section , we apply the proposed optimal shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio ( [ bonafide ] ) to real data which consist of daily returns on the 417 assets listed in the s@xmath191p @xmath192 ( standard @xmath191 poor s @xmath192 ) index and traded during the period from 22.04.2013 to 19.03.2014 .",

    "the s&p 500 index is based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies having common stock listed on the nasdaq .    in this empirical study",
    "we compare the performance of the derived optimal shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio weights given by ( [ bonafide ] ) with the traditional estimator and the dominating estimator suggested by frahm and memmel ( 2010 ) .",
    "the comparison is based a procedure which is similar to the rolling - window approach proposed by demiguel et al .",
    "in particular , we randomly pick up a portfolio of dimension @xmath194 from all @xmath195 portfolios and estimate the portfolio weights for the given estimation window of the length @xmath196 .",
    "we repeat this rolling - window procedure for the next step by including data of the next day and dropping out the data of the last day until the end of the data set is reached .",
    "the estimation window @xmath1 is chosen such that the concentration ratio @xmath197 lies in the set @xmath198 .    in order to compare the performance of the estimators we consider the out - of - sample variance and the out - of - sample sharpe ratio .",
    "let @xmath199 be an estimator for the gmv portfolio which is based on the window with last observation at time @xmath163 and let @xmath200 be the vector of the asset returns for the next period @xmath201 .",
    "then the out - of - sample variance and the out - of - sample sharpe ratio are calculated by @xmath202    in order to measure the statistical significance we sample randomly @xmath203 different portfolios and calculate the e.c.d .",
    "functions of their out - of - sample variances and the corresponding out - of - sample sharpe ratios .",
    "the best strategy is chosen similarly to the stochastic dominance principle , i.e. we look for the strategy whose e.c.d.f .",

    "this portfolio is widely used as an investment opportunity in both static and dynamic optimal portfolio choice problems .",
    "although an explicit analytical expression for the structure of the gmv portfolio weights is available in literature , the estimation of the gmv portfolio appears to be a very challenging problem , especially for high - dimensional data .",
    "we deal with this problem in the present paper by deriving a feasible and robust estimator for the weights of the gmv portfolio when the distribution of the asset returns is not prespecified and no market structure is imposed .",
    "we construct an optimal shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio which is optimal in the sense of minimizing the out - of - sample variance . an analytical expression for the shrinkage intensity",
    "is obtained which appears to be a complicated function of the data and the parameters of the asset return distribution .",
    "we deal with the later problem by determining an asymptotically equivalent quantity of the shrinkage intensity under high - dimensional asymptotics .",
    "we estimate this asymptotically equivalent function consistently by applying recent results from random matrix theory .",
    "this is achieved under very weak assumptions imposed on the distribution of the asset returns .",
    "namely , we only require the existence of the fourth moment , whereas no explicit distributional assumption is imposed . moreover , our findings are still valid in both cases @xmath20 and @xmath21 as well as if the spectrum of the population covariance matrix is bounded or unbounded . as a result ,",
    "the suggested method can be applied to heavy - tailed distributed asset returns as well as to asset returns whose dynamics can be modeled by a factor model which is a very popular approach in financial and econometric literature . finally , using simulated and real data , we compare the optimal shrinkage estimator for the gmv portfolio with existing ones .",
    "the theoretical findings as well as the results of the monte carlo simulations and an empirical study show that the suggested estimator for the gmv portfolio weights dominates the existing estimators in case @xmath17 .",
    "here the proofs of the theorems are given .",
