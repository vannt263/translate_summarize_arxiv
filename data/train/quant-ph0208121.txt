    "the bayesian approach takes probability to be a measure of ignorance , reflecting our state of knowledge and not merely the state of the world .",
    "it follows ramsey s contention that `` we have the authority both of ordinary language and of many great thinkers for discussing under the heading of probability ... the logic of partial belief '' ( ramsey 1926 , p. 55 ) . here",
    "we shall assume , furthermore , that probabilistic beliefs are expressed in rational betting behavior : `` the old - established way of measuring a person s belief ... by proposing a bet , and see what are the lowest odds which he will accept , is fundamentally sound '' .",
    "my aim is to provide an account of the peculiarities of quantum probability in this framework .",
    "the approach is intimately related to the foundational work on quantum information by barnum et al ( 2000 ) , fuchs ( 2001 ) , schack , brun and caves ( 2001 ) and caves , fuchs and schack ( 2002 ) ..    for the purpose of analyzing quantum probability we shall consider _ quantum gambles .",
    "_ each quantum gamble has four stages :    \\1 .",
    "single _ physical system is prepared by a method known to everybody .",
    "finite _ set @xmath0 of incompatible measurements is announced by the bookie , and the agent is asked to place bets on possible outcomes of each one of them .",
    "one of the measurements in the set @xmath0 is chosen by the bookie and the money placed on all other measurements is promptly returned to the agent .",
    "the chosen measurement is performed and the agent gains or looses in accordance with his bet on that measurement .",
    "we do not assume that the agent who participates in the game knows quantum theory .",
    "we do assume that after the second stage , when the set of measurements is announced , the agent is aware of the possible outcomes of each one of the measurements , and also of the relations ( if any ) between the outcomes of different measurements in the set @xmath0 .",
    "let me make these assumptions precise .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we shall only consider measurements with a finite set of possible outcomes .",
    "let @xmath1 be an observable with @xmath2 possible distinct outcomes @xmath3",
    ". with each outcome corresponds an _ event _ @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and these events generate a boolean algebra which we shall denote by @xmath6 . _",
    "subsequently we shall identify the observable _",
    "@xmath1 _ _  with this boolean algebra . _ _ note that this is an unusual identification .",
    "it means that we equate the observables @xmath1 and @xmath7 , whenever @xmath8 is a one - one function defined on the eigenvalues of @xmath1 .",
    "this step is justified since we are interested in _ outcomes _ and not their labels , hence the scale free concept of observable . with this @xmath0",
    "is a finite family of finite boolean algebras .",
    "our first assumption is that the agent knows the number of possible distinct outcomes of each measurement in the set @xmath0 .",
    "our next assumption concerns the case where two measurements in the set @xmath9 share some possible elements .",
    "for example , let @xmath10 be three observables such that @xmath11=0 $ ] , @xmath12=0 $ ] , but @xmath13\\neq 0 $ ] . consider the two incompatible measurements , the first of @xmath1 and @xmath14  together and the second of @xmath14 and @xmath15 together . if @xmath16 is the boolean algebra generated by the outcomes of the first measurement and @xmath17 of the second , then @xmath18 and the events @xmath19 are elements of both algebras , that is of @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the agent is aware of these facts when he is placing his bets .",
    "the smallest nontrivial case of this kind is depicted in figure 1 .",
    "the graph represents two boolean algebras @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath22 corresponding to the outcomes of two incompatible measurements and they share a common event @xmath23 . the complement of @xmath23 denoted by @xmath24 is identified as @xmath25 .",
    "the edges in the graph represent the partial order relations in each algebra from bottom to top .",
    "a realization of these relations can be obtained by the system considered in kochen and specker ( 1967 ) : let @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 be the squared components of spin in the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 directions of a spin-1 ( massive ) particle , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath35  form two orthogonal triples of directions with the @xmath35-direction in common .",
    "the operators @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath39 all commute , and have eigenvalues @xmath40 .",
    "they can be measured simultaneusly , and they satisfy @xmath41 .",
    "similar relations hold in the other triple @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath35 . hence ,",
    "if we define @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 we obtain the two boolean algebras depicted in figure 1 .    to sum",
    ", we assume that when the set of measurements @xmath0 is announced the agent is fully aware of the number of outcomes in each measurement and of the relations between the boolean algebras they generate . in the spin-1 case",
    "just considered it means that the agent is aware of the graph structure in figure 1 .",
    "we shall refer in short to this background knowledge as _ the logic of the gamble_. we assume no further knowledge on the part of the agent , in particular , no knowledge of quantum mechanics .",
    "our purpose is to calculate the constraints on the probabilities that a rational agent can place in such gambles .      already at this stage",
    "one might object that the identity of observables in quantum mechanics _",
    "depends on probability_. consider the case of the operators @xmath10 such that @xmath11=0 $ ] , @xmath12=0 $ ] , but @xmath13\\neq 0 $ ] , and the two incompatible measurements of @xmath1 together with @xmath14 , and of @xmath14 together with @xmath15 .",
    "we are assuming that the agent is aware of the fact that the events @xmath19 are the same in both measurements .",
    "however , the actual procedure of measuring @xmath14 can be very different in the two cases , so how is such awareness comes about ?",
    "indeed , the identity criterion for ( our kind of ) observables is : _ _ two procedures constitute measurements of the same observable if for any given physical state ( preparation ) they yield identical probability distribution over the set of possible outcomes___. _ it seems therefore that foreknowledge of the probabilities is a necessary condition for defining the identities of observables .",
    "but now we face a similar problem , how would one know when two _ states _ are the same ? identical states can be prepared in ways that are physically quite distinct . well , _ two state preparations are the same if for any given measurement they yield the same distribution of outcomes_. a vicious circle",
    ".    there is nothing special about this circularity , a typical characteristic of operational `` definitions '' ( putnam , 1965 ) .",
    "in fact , one encounters a similar problem in traditional probability theory in the interplay between the identity of events and their probability .",
    "the way to proceed is to remember that the point of the operational exercise is not to reduce the theoretical objects of the theory to experiments , but to _ analyze _ their meaning and their respective role in the theory . in this idealized and nonreductive approach",
    "one takes the identity of one family of objects as somehow given , and proceeds to recover the rest .",
    "consider how this is done in a recent article by hardy ( 2001 ) .",
    "assuming that the probabilities of quantum measurements are experimentally given as relative frequencies , and assuming they satisfy certain relations , hardy derives the structure of the observables ( that is , the hilbert space ) .",
    "his `` solution '' to the problem of the identity of states , or preparations , is simple .",
    "he stipulates that `` preparation '' corresponds to a position of a certain dial , one dial position for each preparation .",
    "the problem is simply avoided by idealizing it away .    our approach is the mirror image of hardy s .",
    "we are assuming that the identities of the observables ( and in particular , events ) are given , and proceed to recover the probabilities .",
    "this line of development is shared with all traditional approaches to probability where the identity of the events is invariably assumed to be given prior to the development of the theory .",
    "it is , moreover , easy to think of an idealized story which would cover our identity assumption .",
    "for example , in the three operator case @xmath47 mentioned above , we can imagine that the results of their measurements are presented on three different dials .",
    "if @xmath14 is measured together with @xmath1 then the @xmath1-dial and @xmath14-dial show the results ; if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are measured together the @xmath14-dial and @xmath15-dial show the results .",
    "thus , fraud notwithstanding , the agent knows that he faces the measurement of the same @xmath48 simply because the same gadget shows the outcome in both cases .",
    "our purpose is to calculate the constraints on the probabilities that a rational agent can place in a quantum gamble @xmath0 .",
    "these probabilities have the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and@xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "the elements @xmath53 @xmath54 will be called simply `` events '' .",
    "_ it is understood that an event is always given in the context of a measurement _ @xmath55 .",
    "the probability @xmath56 is the degree of belief that the event @xmath57 occurs in the measurement @xmath58 .",
    "there are two rules of rational gambling , the first is straightforward and the second more subtle .    * rule  1 : * _ for each measurement _ @xmath55 _ the function _ @xmath59 _ _  is a probability distribution on _ _ @xmath52 .",
    "this follows directly from the classical bayesian approach .",
    "recall that after the third stage in the quantum gamble the agent faces a bet on the outcome of a single measurement .",
    "the situation at this stage is essentially the same as a tossing of a coin or a casting of a dice .",
    "hence , the probability values assigned to the possible outcomes of the chosen measurement should be coherent .",
    "in other words , they have to satisfy the axioms of the probability calculus .",
    "the argument for that is that an agent who fails to be coherent will be compelled by the bookie to place bets that will cause him a sure loss ( this is the `` dutch book '' argument ) .",
    "the argument is developed in detail in many texts ( for example , de finetti , 1974 ) and i will not repeat it here . since at the outset",
    "the agent does not know which measurement @xmath55 will be chosen by the bookie rule 1 follows .",
    "* rule 2 : * _ if _ @xmath60,@xmath61 _ _  then",
    "_ _ @xmath62 .",
    "the rule asserts the non - contextuality of probability ( barnum et al , 2000 ) .",
    "it is not so much a rule of rationality , rather it is related to the logic of the gamble and the identity of observables ( remembering that we identify each observable with the boolean algebra generated by its possible outcomes ) .",
    "suppose that in the game @xmath0 , there are two measurements @xmath63 , and an event @xmath64 .",
    "assume that an agent chooses to assign _ _",
    "_ _ @xmath65 .",
    "a natural question to ask her then is why she assigns @xmath57 different probabilities in the two contexts , though she thinks it is the same event .",
    "the only answer consistent with bayesian probability theory is that she takes the @xmath66 as _ conditional probabilities _ and therefore not necessarily equal . in other words",
    ", she considers the act of choosing an experiment @xmath67 ( in stage 3 of the gamble ) as an event in a larger algebra @xmath58 which contains @xmath68 .",
    "consequently she calculates the conditional probability of @xmath57 , given the choice of @xmath67 .",
    "there are two problems with this view .",
    "firstly , the agent can no longer maintain that @xmath69 , in fact @xmath57 is not an element of any of the @xmath70 s and can no longer be described as _",
    "an outcome _ of a mesurement .",
    "secondly , the agent assumes that there is a single `` big '' boolean algebra @xmath52 , the event @xmath57 is an element of @xmath52 , and @xmath68 are sub - algebras of @xmath52 .",
    "the trouble is that _ _  for sufficiently rich games _ _",
    "_  this assumption is inconsistent .",
    "_ _ in other words , there are gambles @xmath0 which can not be imbedded in a boolean algebra without destroying the identities of the events and the logical relations between them .",
    "this is a consequence of the kochen and specker ( 1967 ) theorem to which we shall come in ( 2.2 ) .",
    "it means , essentially , that an agent who violates rule  2 , is failing to grasp the logic of the gamble and wrongly assumes that she is playing a different game .",
    "another possibility is that assigning @xmath71 indicates that the agent is using a different notion of conditional probability .",
    "the burden of clarification is then on the agent , to uncover her sense of conditionalization and show how it is related to quantum gambles .",
    "thus , we conclude that the violation of rule 2 implies either an ignorance of the logic of the gamble , or an incoherent use of conditional probabilities .",
    "it is clear that our argument here is weaker than the dutch book argument for rule 1 .",
    "a violation of rule 2 does not imply a sure loss in a single shot game .",
    "we shall return to this argument , with a greater detail in section 2.2 .",
    "rational probability values assigned in finite games need not be numerically identical to the quantum mechanical probabilities .",
    "however , with sufficiently complex gambles we can show that all the interesting features of quantum probability- from the uncertainty principle to the violation of bell inequality - are present even in finite gambles .",
    "if we extend our discussion to gambles with an infinity of possible measurements , then rule1 and rule 2 force the probabilities to follow born rule ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "a quantum gamble is a set of boolean algebras with certain ( possible ) relations between them .",
    "the details of these algebras and their relations is all that the agent needs to know .",
    "we do not assume that the agent knows any quantum theory .",
    "however , engineers who construct gambling devices should know a little more",
    ". they should be aware of the physical possibilities .",
    "this is true in the classical domain as much as in the quantum domain .",
    "after all , the theory of probability , even in its most subjective form , associates a person s degree of belief with the objective possibilities in the physical world . in the quantum case",
    "the objective physical part concerns the _ type _ of gambles which can actually be constructed .",
    "it turns out that not all finite families of boolean algebras represent possible games , at least as far as present day physics is concerned .",
    "i shall describe the family of possible gambles , in a somewhat abstract way .",
    "it is a consequence of von neumann ( 1955 ) analysis of the set of possible measurements .",
    "let @xmath72 be the @xmath2-dimensional vector space over the real or complex field , equipped with the usual inner product .",
    "let @xmath73 be @xmath74 non zero subspaces of @xmath72 , which are orthogonal in pairs @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and which together span the entire space , @xmath77 .",
    "these subspaces generate a boolean algebra , call it @xmath78 , in the following way : the zero of the algebra is the null subspace , the non zero elements of the algebra are subspaces the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 . if @xmath81 are two elements in the algebra let @xmath82 be the subspace spanned by the ( set theoretic ) union @xmath83 , let @xmath84 , and let the complement of @xmath85 , denoted by @xmath86 , be the subspace orthogonal to @xmath85 such that @xmath87",
    ". then @xmath78 with the operations @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 is a boolean algebra with @xmath91 elements .",
    "note that a maximal algebra of this kind is obtained when we take all the @xmath92s to be one - dimensional subspaces ( rays ) .",
    "then @xmath93 and the algebra has @xmath94 elements .",
    "now , let @xmath95 be the family of _ all _ the boolean algebras obtained from subspaces of @xmath72  in the way described above . obviously , if @xmath96 then @xmath97 is also boolean algebra in @xmath98 .",
    "we shall say that two subspaces _ _  _ _ @xmath99 _ _  _ _ of _ _  _ _ @xmath100 _ _  _ _ are _ _  compatible in _ _ @xmath72 _ _  _ _ if there is _ _  _",
    "_ @xmath101 _ _  _ _ such that _ _  _ _ @xmath102 _ _ , _ _ otherwise @xmath103 _ _  _ _ and _ _  _ _ @xmath85 _ _  _ _ are incompatible .",
    "two algebras @xmath104 are _ incompatible in _",
    "@xmath72 if there are subspaces @xmath105 and @xmath106 which are incompatible .",
    "* possibility criterion : * @xmath0 _ is a possible quantum gamble if there is a finite dimensional complex or real hilbert space _ @xmath100 _ such that _ @xmath0 _ is a finite family of boolean algebras in _",
    "@xmath95 _ which are incompatible in pairs_.    one could proceed with the probabilistic account disregarding this criterion and , in fact , go beyond what is known to be physically possible ( see svozil , 1998 ) .",
    "we shall not do that , however , and all the games considered in this paper are physically possible . with each of the gambles to be discussed in this paper we proceed in two stages .",
    "firstly , we present the boolean algebras , their relations and the consequences for probability . secondly , we prove that the gamble obeys the possibility criterion .",
    "consider the following quantum gamble @xmath0 consisting of seven incompatible measurements ( boolean algebras ) , each generated by its three possible outcomes : @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "note that some of the outcomes are shared by two measurements , these are denoted by the letter @xmath114 .",
    "the other outcomes belong each to a single algebra and denoted by @xmath57 . as before , when two algebras share an event they also share its complement so that , for example,@xmath115 , and similarly in the other cases . the logical relations among the generators are depicted in the graph of figure 2 .",
    "this is _ the compatibility graph _ of the generators .",
    "each node in the graph represents an outcome , two nodes are connected by an edge if , and only if the corresponding outcomes belong to a common algebra ; each triangle represents the generators of one of the algebras .",
    "we assume that the agent is aware of the seven algebras and the connections between them . by rule 2",
    "the probability he assigns to each event is independent of the boolean algebra ( measurement ) which is considered , for example , @xmath116 .",
    "rule 1 entails that the probabilities of each triple of outcomes of each measurement should sum up to 1 , for example , @xmath117 .",
    "there are altogether seven equations of this kind . combining them with the fact that probability is non - negative ( by rule  1 ) it is easy to prove that the probabilities assigned by our rational agent should satisfy @xmath118",
    "this is an example of an _ uncertainty relation _ , a constraint on the probabilities assigned to the outcomes of incompatible measurements .",
    "in particular , if the system is prepared in such a way that it is rational to assign @xmath119 ( see 2.5 ) then the rules of quantum games force @xmath120 .    to see why @xmath0 represents a physically possible gamble we use the possibility criterion  and identify each event with a one dimensional subspace of  @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) in the following way",
    "@xmath123 is the subspace spanned by the vector @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "note that the vectors associated with compatible subspaces are orthogonal , so that figure 2 is the orthogonality graph for these thirteen vectors .    a more concrete way to represent",
    "this game is to consider each of these vectors as depicting a direction in physical space . for the vector @xmath137 let @xmath138 be the square of the spin in the @xmath137-direction of a massive spin-1 particle , so that its eigenvalues are @xmath40 .",
    "now , for each of the thirteen vectors above take the event @xmath139",
    ". then the relations in figure 2 are satisfied .",
    "this example is a special case of a more general principle ( pitowsky , 1998 ) :    let @xmath140 _ be two incompatible rays in a hilbert space _ @xmath100  whose dimension @xmath141 .",
    "then there is a ( finite ) quantum gamble @xmath142 in which @xmath140 are events , and every probability assignment @xmath143 for @xmath0 which satisfies rule 1 and rule 2 also satisfies @xmath144 .",
    "consider the gamble @xmath0 of eleven incompatible measurements , each with four possible outcomes .",
    "@xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 ,    @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 ,    @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 ,    @xmath154 , @xmath155    the two outcomes denoted by the letter @xmath114 are shared by four measurement each , and the outcomes denoted by @xmath57 are shared by two measurements each .",
    "altogether there are twenty outcomes .",
    "this example is based on a proof of the kochen and specker ( 1967 ) theorem due to kargnahan(1994 ) .",
    "( the original proof requires hundreds of measurements , with three outcomes each and 117 outcomes in all ) . again , when an event is shared by two measurements then so does its complement , for example , @xmath156 .",
    "now , suppose that all the algebras @xmath157 are sub - algebras of a boolean algebra @xmath52 .",
    "assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath58 is an algebra of subsets of a set @xmath158 . with this identification the events",
    "@xmath159 are subsets of @xmath158 .",
    "the logical relations between the events dictates that any two of the events among the @xmath160 s and @xmath161 s that share the same algebra @xmath157 are disjoint .",
    "moreover , the union of all four outcomes in each algebra @xmath157 , is identical to @xmath158 , for example , @xmath162 is the union of the outcomes in @xmath163 . but",
    "this leads to a contradiction because the intersection of all these unions is necessarily empty !    to see that suppose , by contrast , that there is @xmath164 such that @xmath31 belongs to exactly one outcome , @xmath160 or @xmath165 , in each one of the eleven algebras @xmath157 .",
    "this means that @xmath31 belong to eleven such events ( with repetition counted ) .",
    "but this is impossible since each one of the outcomes appears an even number of times in the eleven algebras , and eleven is an odd number .",
    "one consequence of this is related to rule  2 discussed in section 1.3 .",
    "suppose that an agent thinks about the probabilities of the events @xmath166 as conditional on the measurement performed .",
    "if the term `` conditional probability '' is used in its usual sense then the events should be interpreted as elements of a single boolean algebra @xmath52 ( taken again as an algebra of subsets of some set @xmath158 ) . to avoid the kochen specker contradiction the agent can use two strategies .",
    "the first to take some of the generating events in at least one algebra to be non - disjoint in pairs ,  for example , @xmath167 . in this case",
    "the agent seizes to see the events @xmath168 as representing _ measurement outcomes , _ and associates with them some other meaning ( although he eventually takes the conditional probability of @xmath169 to be zero ) .",
    "the other strategy is to take the union of  the outcomes of some measurements to be proper subset of @xmath158 .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath170 , @xmath171 . in this case",
    "the agent actually adds another theoretical outcome ( which , however , has conditional probability zero ) .",
    "both strategies represent a distortion of the logical relations among the events , which we have assumed as given .    on a less formal level",
    "we can ask why would anyone do that ?",
    "the additional structure assumed by the agent amounts to a strange `` hidden variable theory '' for the set of experiments @xmath0 .",
    "there is a great theoretical interest in hidden variable theories , but they are of little value to the rational gambler .",
    "a classical analogue would be a person who thinks that a coin _ really _ has three sides ` head ' , ` belly ' and ` tail ' and assigns a prior probability @xmath172 to each . but",
    "the act of tossing the coin ( or looking at it , or physically interacting with it ) causes the belly side never to show up , so the probability of belly , conditional on tossing ( or looking , or interacting ) , is zero .",
    "the betting behavior of such a person is rational in the sense that no dutch book argument against him is possible .",
    "however , as far as gambling on a coin toss is concerned , his theory of coins is not altogether rational .",
    "it is the elimination of this kind of irrationality which motivates rule 2 .",
    "another consequence of this gamble concerns the relations between probability and logical truth .",
    "often the kochen and specker theorem is taken as an indication that in quantum mechanics a classical logical falsity may sometimes be true ( bub , 1974 ; demopoulos , 1976 ) . to see how ,",
    "consider the @xmath173 and @xmath165 as _ propositional variables , _ and for each @xmath174 let @xmath175 be the proposition which says : `` exactly one of the variable in the group @xmath74 is true '' , for example ,    @xmath176    then @xmath177 is a classical logical falsity . but @xmath178 is ` quantum mechanically true ' with respect to the system described above , because each one of the @xmath175 s is a true description of it .    in our gambling picture we make a more modest claim .",
    "a rational agent who participates in the quantum gamble will assign , in advance , probability @xmath179 to each @xmath175 .",
    "therefore , arguably the agent also assigns @xmath178 probability @xmath179 . but this is an _ epistemic _ position which does not oblige the agent to assign truth values to the @xmath180 s and @xmath165 s , nor is he committed to say that such truth values exist .",
    "indeed , this is a strong indication that ` probability one ' and ` truth ' are quite different from one another .",
    "the epr system ( below ) provides another example",
    ". there is , however , a weaker sense in which @xmath178 is true and we shall discuss it in the philosophical discussion 3.1 .",
    "the following is a proof that our game satisfies the possibility criterion .",
    "each @xmath160 and each @xmath165 is identified with a ray ( one dimensional subspace ) of  @xmath181 ( or @xmath182 ) .",
    "two outcome which share the same algebra correspond to orthogonal rays .",
    "the rays are identified by a vector that spans them :    @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 ,    @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 ,    @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 ,    @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 ,    @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 .",
    "given two ( not necessarily disjoint ) events @xmath1 , @xmath14 in the same algebra , denote @xmath203 , and for three events @xmath10 denote by @xmath204 the boolean algebra that they generate :    @xmath205    in order to recover the argument of the einstein rosen and podolsky ( 1935 ) and bell ( 1966 ) paradox within a  quantum gamble we shall use mermin ( 1990 ) representation of ghz , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( 1989 )  system .",
    "consider the gamble which consists of eight possible measurements : the four measurements @xmath206 , @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 each with eight possible outcomes and    @xmath210 ,    @xmath211 ,    @xmath212 ,    @xmath213 ,    each with six possible outcomes .",
    "assume that the agent has good reasons to believe that @xmath214 .",
    "such a belief can come about in a variety of ways , for example , she may know something about the preparation of the system form a previous measurement result ( see section 2.5 ) .",
    "alternatively , the bookie may announce in advance that he will raise his stakes indefinitely against any bet made for @xmath215 .",
    "whatever the source of information , the agent has good reasons to assign probability zero to four out of the eight outcomes in each one of the four measurements @xmath16 to @xmath216 .",
    "the remaining events are    @xmath217    denote by @xmath218 the sum of the probabilities of these sixteen events .",
    "given that @xmath214 the probabilities of the events in each row in ( 1 ) _",
    "_  _ _ sum up to @xmath179 .",
    "altogether , the rational assignment is therefore @xmath219 .",
    "however , _ if _",
    "@xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 _ _  are events in any ( classical ) probability space then the sum of the probabilities of the events in _ _ ( 1 )",
    "_  never exceeds _ @xmath226 .",
    "this is one of the constraints on the values of probabilities which boole called `` conditions of possible experience '' and it is violated by any rational assignment in this quantum gamble . on one level",
    "this is just another example of a quantum gamble that can not be imbedded in a single classical probability space without distorting the identity of the events and the logical relations between them .",
    "a more dramatic example has been the kochen and specker s theorem of the previous section .",
    "the special importance of the epr case lies in the details of the physical system and the way the measurements @xmath227 are performed .",
    "the system is composed of three particles which interacted in the past , but are now spatially separated and are no longer interacting .",
    "on the first particle we can choose to perform an @xmath220-measurement or an @xmath223-measurement ( but not both ) each with two possible outcomes .",
    "similarly , we can choose to perform on the second particle one of two @xmath14-measurement , and one of two @xmath15-measurement on the third particle .",
    "the algebras @xmath227 represent the outcomes of four out of the eight logically possible combinations of such local measurements . in this physical arrangement",
    "we can recover the epr reasoning , and bell s rebuttal , which i will not repeat here .",
    "the essence of bell s theorem is that the epr assumptions lead to the conclusion that @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath228 , @xmath225 belong to a single boolean algebra .",
    "consequently , the sum of the probabilities of the events in ( 1 ) can not exceed @xmath226 , in contradiction to rule1 and rule 2 .",
    "which of two epr assumptions ` reality ' or ` locality ' should the bayesian reject ?",
    "in the previous section we have made the distinction between ` probability @xmath179 ' and ` truth ' .",
    "but the _ identification _ of the two is precisely the subject matter of epr s principle of reality : `` if without in any way disturbing a system we can predict with certainty ( i.e. with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of reality corresponding to this physical quantity '' ( einstein rosen and podolsky , 1935)_. _ quite independently of bell s argument , a bayesian should take a sceptical view of this principle .",
    "`` probability equal to unity '' means that the degree of rational belief has reached a level of certainty .",
    "it does not reflect any prejudice about possible causes of the outcomes . on the other hand , there seem to be no good grounds for rejecting the principle of locality on the basis of this or similar gambles .    to prove that this gamble satisfies the possibility criterion",

    "the outcomes in @xmath248 are one dimensional subspaces , for example @xmath249 .",
    "the subspace @xmath250 is the one dimensional ray along the ghz state @xmath251 where @xmath35 is the direction orthogonal to @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "the subspaces @xmath252 are just the orthocomplements , in @xmath253 , to the direct sum of the other subspaces in their respective algebras . hence , @xmath254 .",
    "let us take the idealization a step further .",
    "assume that the bookie announces that @xmath0 contains all the maximal boolean algebras in @xmath255 for some finite dimensional real or complex hilbert space @xmath100 with @xmath256 .",
    "recall that if @xmath73 are @xmath74 non zero subspaces of @xmath72 , which are orthogonal in pairs , and whose direct sum is the entire space , they generate a boolean algebra @xmath257 ( section 1.4 ) .",
    "if @xmath258 the algebra is maximal and each subspace @xmath259 is one dimensional . in other words ,",
    "the set @xmath0 consists of all non - degenerate measurements with @xmath2 outcomes .",
    "the information theoretic aspects of this case are discussed in caves , fuchs and schack ( 2002 )    there is a certain difficulty in extending quantum gambles to this case since there are a continuum of possible measurements , and the agent is supposed to place money on each .",
    "we can overcome this difficulty by assuming that the agent makes a commitment to pay a certain amount on each outcome of each measurement , without paying any cash in advance .",
    "when a single measurement @xmath55 is chosen by the bookie all the agent s commitments are canceled , except those pertaining to @xmath52 .",
    "rule 1 and rule 2 imply in this case that for any @xmath2 orthogonal rays @xmath260 in @xmath72 the agent s probability function should satisfy    @xmath261    gleason ( 1957 ) proved    let @xmath72 be a hilbert space over field of real or complex numbers with a finite dimension @xmath262 . if @xmath143 is a non negative function defined on the subspaces of @xmath72 @xmath263and satisfies ( 2 ) for every set of @xmath2 orthogonal rays then there is a statistical operator @xmath264 such that for every subspace @xmath85 of @xmath72 @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the projection operator on @xmath85 .    for the proof see also pitowsky ( 1998 ) .",
    "this profound theorem gives a characterization of all probability assignments of quantum theory .",
    "furthermore , if we know that the system is prepared with @xmath267 , for some ray @xmath268 , then @xmath143 is uniquely determined by @xmath269 for all subspaces @xmath85 , where @xmath270 is a unit vector that spans @xmath268 . the theorem can be easily extended to closed subspaces of the infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "it is interesting to note that many of the results about finite quantum gambles that we have considered are actually consequences of gleason s theorem .",
    "consider , for example the kochen and specker s theorem ( section 2.2 ) . to connect it with gleason s theorem",
    "take an appropriate first order formal theory of the rays of @xmath271 , the orthogonality relation between them , and the real functions defined on them ( where @xmath262 finite and fixed ) .",
    "add to it a special function symbol @xmath143 , the axiom that @xmath143 is non negative , the axiom that @xmath143 is not a constant , the axiom that @xmath143 has only two values zero or one .",
    "now , add the infinitely many axioms @xmath272 for each @xmath2-tuple of orthogonal rays in @xmath273 . by gleason s theorem",
    "this theory is inconsistent ( since by ( 3 ) @xmath143 has a continuum of values ) .",
    "hence , there is a finite subset of this set of axioms which is inconsistent , meaning a finite subset of rays which satisfy the kochen and specker s theorem .",
    "this is , of course , a non constructive proof , and an explicit construction is preferable .",
    "however , the consideration just mentioned can be used to obtain more general non - constructive results about finite games .",
    "one such immediate result is theorem 1 which also has a constructive proof .",
    "( in fact , the proof of gleason s theorem involves a construction similar to that of theorem 1 , see pitowsky , 1998 )    gleason s theorem indicates that the use of the adjective ` subjective ' to describe epistemic probability is a misnomer . even in the classical realm it has misleading connotations .",
    "classically , different agents that start with different prior probability assignments eventually converge on the same probability distribution as they learn more and more from common experience . in the quantum realm",
    "the situation is more extreme . for a given a single physical system gleason",
    "s theorem dictates that all agents share a common prior or , in the worst case , they start using the same probability distribution after a single ( maximal ) measurement .",
    "consider two gambles , @xmath274 , @xmath275 and assume that @xmath276 is a common event .",
    "in other words , there is @xmath277 and @xmath278 such that @xmath279 .",
    "we can consider sequential gambles in which the gamble @xmath274 is played , and subsequently after the results are recorded , the gamble @xmath275 follows with the measurements performed _ on the same system . _ in such cases the agent can place _",
    "conditional bets _ of the form _ _ : _ _ `` if @xmath1 occurs in the first gamble place such and such odds in the second gamble '' .",
    "this means that the of probabilities assigned in the second game @xmath275 are constrained by the condition @xmath280 ( in addition to the constraints imposed by rule 1 and rule  2 ) .",
    "the epr gamble in 2.3 can be seen as such a conditional game , when we consider the preparation process as a previous gamble with an outcome @xmath250 .",
    "in fact , all preparations ( at least of pure states ) can be seen in that light .    if the gambles @xmath274 , @xmath275 are infinite , and contain all the maximal algebras in @xmath95 , gleason s theorem dictates the rule for conditional betting . in the second gamble the probability is the square of the length of the projection on ( the subspace corresponding to ) @xmath1 . the conditional probability is therefore given by lders rule ( bub , 1997 ) .",
    "the line we have taken has some affinity with bohr s approach -or more precisely , with the view often attributed to bohr - in that we treat the outcomes of future measurements as mere possibilities , and do not associate them with properties that exist prior to the act of measurement .",
    "bohr s position , however , has some other features which are better avoided . consider a spin-1 massive particle and suppose that we measure @xmath281 , its spin along the @xmath35-direction .",
    "bohr would say that in this circumstance attributing values to @xmath282 and @xmath283 is meaningless .",
    "but the equation @xmath41 remains valid then , as it is valid at all times .",
    "how can an expression which contains meaningless ( or valueless ) terms be itself valid ?",
    "indeed , non - commuting observables may satisfy algebraic equations , the laws of nature often take such form .",
    "what is the status of such equations at the time when only one component in them has been meaningfully assigned a value ?",
    "what is their status when no measurement has been performed ?",
    "quantum logic , in some of its formulations , has been an attempt to answer this question _ realistically . _",
    "it had began with the seminal work of birkhoff and von - neumann ( 1936 ) .",
    "a later modification was inspired by the work of kochen and specker ( 1967 ) .",
    "the realist interpretation of the quantum logical formalism is due to finkelstein ( 1962 ) , putnam ( 1968 ) , bub ( 1974 ) , demopoulos ( 1976 ) .",
    "consider , for example , the gamble @xmath21 , @xmath22 made of two incompatible measurements , with one common outcome @xmath23 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "let us loosely identify the outcomes @xmath173 with the propositions that describe them .",
    "the realist quantum logician maintains that both @xmath284 and @xmath285 are true , and therefore so is @xmath286 . but only one of the measurements @xmath287 or @xmath17 can be conducted at one time .",
    "this means that , generally , only three out of the five @xmath160 s can be experimentally assigned a truth value ( except in the case that @xmath23 turns out to be true which makes the other four events false ) .",
    "this does not prevent us from assigning _",
    "hypothetical _ truth values to the @xmath160 s that make @xmath1 true .",
    "however , as we have seen in 2.2 , the trouble begins when we consider more complex gambles . to repeat , let @xmath0 be the gamble of 2.2 , and for each @xmath288 let @xmath175 be the proposition which says : `` exactly one of the variables in the group @xmath74 is true '' , for example ,",
    "still , the quantum logician maintains that @xmath14 is true . or , by analogy , that @xmath41 is true for every orthogonal triple @xmath31 , @xmath290 , @xmath35 in physical space",
    "this is the quantum logical solution of the bohrian dilemma and it comes with a heavy price - tag : the repudiation of classical propositional logic .",
    "but what does it mean to say that @xmath14 is true ?",
    "as i have shown elsewhere ( pitowsky , 1989 ) the operational analysis of the quantum logical connectives , due to finkelstein and putnam , leads to a non - local hidden variable theory in disguise .",
    "moreover , from a bayesian perspective it is quite sufficient to say that @xmath14 has probability @xmath179 , meaning that each conjunct in @xmath14 has probability @xmath179 that is , a degree of belief approaching certainty .",
    "indeed , the bayesian does not consider even the laws of nature as true , only as being nearly certain , given present day knowledge .",
    "nevertheless , there is a sense in which @xmath1 or even @xmath14 are true , and this is the sense that enables our bayesian analysis in the first place .",
    "thus , _ _ to assert that  _ _",
    "@xmath291 _",
    "is true  is nothing but a cumbersome way to say that the gamble",
    "_ @xmath292 _ _",
    "exists__. this is first and foremost a statement about the identities : the outcome @xmath23 is _ really _ the same in the two measurements , and @xmath293 .",
    "it is also a statement about physical realizations , this gamble can be designed and played ( experimental difficulties notwithstanding ) .",
    "viewed in this light quantum gambles together with rule 1 and rule 2 form _",
    "_  semantics for quantum logic , _ _ in that they assign meaning to the identities of quantum logic ( in its partial boolean algebra formulation)_. _    the metaphysical assumption underlying the bayesian approach is therefore _ realism about the structure of quantum gambles _ , in particular those that satisfy the possibility criterion ( 1.4 ) .",
    "this position is close in spirit ( but not identical ) to the view that quantum mechanics is a complete theory , so let us turn to the alternative view .",
    "consider bohm s theory as a typical example . recall that in this theory the state of a single particle at time @xmath294 is given by the pair @xmath295 where @xmath31 is the position of the particle and @xmath296 -the guiding wave- is a solution of the time dependent schrdinger s equation . the guiding condition @xmath297 provides the relation between the two components of the state , where @xmath298 is the particle mass .",
    "the theory is deterministic , an initial position @xmath299 and an initial condition @xmath300 determine the trajectory of the particle and the guiding wave at all future times . in particular ,",
    "the outcome of every measurement is determined by these initial conditions .    as can be expected from the kochen and specker s theorem the outcome of a measurement is context dependent in bohm s theory .",
    "this fact can also be derived by a direct calculation ( pagonis and clifton , 1995 ) . given a fixed initial state @xmath301 the measurement of @xmath39 together with @xmath26 and @xmath28 can yield one result @xmath302 ; but the measurement of @xmath39 together with @xmath27 and @xmath29 can give another result @xmath303 .",
    "now , the identity criterion for observables in a deterministic theory is : _ two procedures constitute measurements of the same observable if for any given physical state ( preparation ) they yield identical outcomes .",
    "_ therefore in bohm s theory the observable `` @xmath39 in the @xmath36 context '' is not really the same as `` @xmath39 in the @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath35 context '' .",
    "nevertheless , the bohmians consider @xmath39 as one single _",
    "observable across contexts .",
    "the reason being that the _ average _ outcome of @xmath39 , over different initial positions with density @xmath304 , is context independent . hence , bohm s theory is a hybrid much like classical statistical mechanics : the dynamics are deterministic but the observables are statistical averages .",
    "since the initial positions are not known -not even knowable- the averages provide the empirical content .",
    "consequently , the observable structure of quantum mechanics is accepted by the bohmians `` for all practical purposes '' .",
    "this attitude prevails when the bohmian is betting in a quantum gamble .",
    "there is no detectable difference in the betting behavior of a bohmian agent ; although the reasons leading to his behavior follow from the causal structure of bohm s theory .",
    "at a first glance there seems to be nothing peculiar about this .",
    "many people who would assign probability @xmath305 to ` heads ' believe that the tossing of a coin is a deterministic process .",
    "indeed , there is a rational basis to this belief : _ _  _ _ if the agent is allowed to inspect the initial conditions of the toss with a greater precision he may change his betting odds .",
    "in other words , his @xmath305 degree of belief is _ conditional _ on his lack of knowledge of the initial state .",
    "obtaining further information is possible , in principle , and in the limit of infinite precision it leads to the assignment of probability zero or one to ` heads ' .  for the bayesian",
    "this is in a large measure what determinism _ means .",
    "_    can we say the same about the bohmian attitude in a quantum gamble ?",
    "according to bohm s theory itself is only an ` equilibrium ' distribution , and deviations from it are possible . in this case",
    "bohm s theory is a genuine empirical extension of quantum mechanics , and the bohmian agent may sometime bet against the rules of quantum mechanics . ]",
    "the position of the particle can not be known beyond the information invested in the distribution @xmath306 .",
    "suppose that a particle is prepared in a ( pure ) quantum state @xmath300 .",
    "then , according to bohm s theory , no further information is obtainable by a prior inspection ( without changing the quantum state , in which case the problem starts all over again ) .",
    "hence , @xmath306 is an absolute , not a conditional probability .",
    "consequently , from a bayesian perspective the determinism of bohm s theory is a myth .",
    "luckily , it does not lead its believers astray in their bets .",
    "what is the function of this myth ? obviously , to retain a sense of determinism , albeit one which is completely disconnected from human knowledge .",
    "but there is also a subtler issue here that have to do with the structure of the observables .",
    "as we have noticed , for the bohmian the event @xmath307 in the @xmath36 context@xmath308 is not the same as the event @xmath309 in the @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath35 context@xmath308 .",
    "hence , the gamble @xmath310 , @xmath311 is interpreted by him as being `` really '' @xmath312 , @xmath313 ; although , as a result of dynamical causes , the long term frequencies of @xmath23 and @xmath314 happen to be identical ( for any given @xmath315 ) .",
    "it follows that the myth also serves the purpose of `` saving classical logic '' by dynamical means ( pitowsky , 1994 ) .",
    "nowhere is this more apparent than in the epr case where bohm s dynamics violate locality on the level of individual processes .    in this sense",
    "the hidden variable approach is conservative .",
    "it is not so much its insistence on determinism , but rather the refusal to acknowledge that the structure of the set of events- our quantum gambles- is real . as a gambler",
    "the bohmian bets as if it is very real ; as a metaphysician he provides a complicated apology .",
    "the bayesian approach represents an instrumental attitude towards the quantum state .",
    "the state is just a code for probabilities , and `` probability theory is simply the quantitative formulation of how to make rational decisions in the face of uncertainty '' ( fuchs and peres , 2000 ) .",
    "instrumentalism seems metaphysically innocent , all we are dealing with are experiments and their outcomes , without a commitment to an underlying , completely described microscopic reality .",
    "one might even be tempted to think that `` quantum theory needs no interpretation '' ( ibid ) .",
    "of course , there is a sense in which this is true .",
    "one needs no causal picture to do physics . like a gambler ,",
    "the physicist can assign probabilities to outcomes , assuming no causal or other mechanisms which bring them about .",
    "but instrumentalism simply pushes the question of interpretation one step up the ladder . instead of dealing directly with ` reality ' ,",
    "the instrumentalist faces the challenge of explaining his instrument , that is , quantum probability .",
    "unlike other mathematical theories- group theory for example- the application of probability requires a philosophical analysis .",
    "after all probability theory is our tool for weighing the relative merits of alternative actions and for making _ rational _ decisions ; decisions that are made rational by their justifications .",
    "indeed , we have provided a part of the justification by demonstrating how the structure of quantum gambles , together with the gambling rules , dictate certain constraints on the assignment of probability values .",
    "the trouble is that these probability values violate classical constraints , for example bell s inequalities .",
    "a hundred and fifty years ago boole had considered these and other similar constraints as `` conditions of possible experience '' , and consequently conditions of rational choice .",
    "today , we witness the appearance of ` impossible ' experience .",
    "the bohmian explains it away by reference to unobservable non - local measurement disturbances .",
    "the instrumentalist , in turn , insists that there is nothing to explain .",
    "but the violations of the classical constraints ( unlike the measurement disturbances ) are provably real .",
    "therefore , something should be said about it if we insist that `` probability theory is simply the quantitative formulation of how to make rational decisions '' .",
    "instrumentalists often take their ` raw material ' to be the set of space - time events : clicks in counters , traces in bubble chambers , dots on photographic plates and so on .",
    "quantum theory imposes on this set a definite structure .",
    "certain blips in space - time are identified as instances of the same event .",
    "some families of clicks in counters are assumed to have logical relations with other families , etc .",
    "what we call _ reality _ is not just the bare set of events _ _ , it is this set together with its structure , _ _ for all that is left without the structure is noise .",
    "it has been von neumann s great achievement to identify this structure , and derive some of the consequences that follow from its details .",
    "i believe that von neumann s contribution to the foundations of quantum theory is exceedingly more important than that of bohr . for it is one thing to say that the only role of quantum theory is to `",
    "predict experimental outcomes ' , and that different measurements are ` complementary ' .",
    "it is quite another thing to provide an _ understanding _ of what it means for two experiments to be incompatible , and yet for their possible outcomes to be related ; to show how these relations imply the uncertainty principle ; and even , finally , to realize that the structure of events dictates the numerical values of the probabilities ( gleason s theorem ) .",
    "bohr s position will not suffice even for the instrumentalists . their view , far from being metaphysically innocent , is founded on an assumption which is more radical than that of the hidden variable theories .",
    "namely , the taxonomy of the universe expressed in the structure of the set of possible events , the quantum gambles which are made possible and the theory of probability they imply , are new and only partially understood pieces of knowledge .",
    "it is the task of an interpretation of quantum mechanics to make sense of these structures and relate them to what we previously used to call ` probability ' and even ` logic ' .",
