    "the precisely measured frequencies of solar oscillations provide us with a unique tool to probe the solar interior with sufficient accuracy .",
    "these frequencies are primarily determined by the dynamical quantities like sound speed , density or the adiabatic index of the solar material and a primary inversion of the observed frequencies yields the sound speed and density profiles inside the sun ( gough @xcite ; gough & kosovichev @xcite ; gough & thompson @xcite ; dziembowski et al .",
    "@xcite ; antia & basu @xcite ; basu et al .",
    "@xcite ; gough et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand , in order to infer the temperature and chemical composition profiles additional assumptions regarding the input physics are required ( shibahashi @xcite ; antia & chitre @xcite ; shibahashi & takata @xcite ; kosovichev @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the equations of thermal equilibrium enable us to determine the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles in the solar interior provided the opacities , equation of state and nuclear energy generation rates are prescribed .",
    "although the primary inversions can yield the sound speed to an accuracy of 0.1% , the opacities and nuclear reaction rates are hardly known to comparable accuracy and consequently , more systematic errors are introduced in these secondary inversions for temperature and chemical composition .",
    "there are a number of approaches adopted for secondary inversions .",
    "kosovichev ( @xcite ) has employed the equations of thermal equilibrium to express the changes in primary variables ( @xmath1 ) in terms of those in secondary variables ( @xmath2 ) and obtained equations connecting the frequency differences to variations in abundance profiles . it should be noted that modifications in @xmath3 profile mainly affect the opacities in the solar interior while the equation of state and nuclear energy generation rates are affected to a much lesser extent .",
    "such a procedure is essentially equivalent to finding the @xmath4 profile along with the necessary opacity modifications .",
    "shibahashi and takata  ( @xcite , hereinafter st96 ) adopt the standard opacities and nuclear reaction rates to obtain the temperature and chemical abundance profiles using the inverted sound speed profile .",
    "antia and chitre  ( @xcite , @xcite ) set out to estimate the central temperature of the sun .",
    "they adopted the inverted sound speed and density profiles to obtain the temperature ( @xmath5 ) and helium abundance ( @xmath4 ) profiles in the solar core , but the main difference was that opacity and nuclear reaction rates were not directly employed for this purpose .",
    "instead , the @xmath5 and @xmath4 profiles were obtained by minimizing the variation in opacities from the standard values .",
    "the main reason for allowing variations in theoretically determined quantity like opacity rather than the ` experimentally ' inferred seismic sound speed and density was that the uncertainties in opacities are probably larger than those in primary inversions .",
    "another advantage of this approach was that it enabled us to study the effect of changes in opacity and nuclear reaction rates on the inferred thermal profiles in a straightforward manner .",
    "the main thrust of the foregoing study was to estimate the central temperature of the sun and the neutrino fluxes .",
    "on the other hand , roxburgh ( @xcite ) and antia & chitre ( @xcite ) studied various possible abundance profiles without any bounds on the opacity variations to study the implication of helioseismic constraints on the solar neutrino problem .    in the present study",
    "we extend the earlier work of antia and chitre  ( @xcite ) to determine the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles throughout the radiative interior of the sun and investigate possible uncertainties that might exist in the basic nuclear energy generation rates and opacities .",
    "recently , there has been a claim that the pp nuclear reaction rate should be revised upwards by a factor of 2.9 ( ivanov et al .",
    "@xcite ) and it would therefore be interesting to test this suggestion helioseismically ( deglinnocenti et al .",
    "further , in the earlier study we had restricted the composition profiles to smooth functions represented by a low degree polynomial , which constrained the class of admissible solutions .",
    "this restriction has been relaxed in the present study by using cubic spline basis functions to represent the composition profiles .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : the inversion technique employed to obtain the temperature and chemical composition profiles is described in section 2 , and the results are set out in section  3 .",
    "our attempts to constrain the cross - section for the pp reaction using the inverted profiles are outlined in section  4 , while section 5 summarizes the conclusions from our study .",
    "the sound speed and density profiles inside the sun are inferred from the observed frequencies using a regularized least squares technique ( antia @xcite ) .",
    "the primary inversions based on the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium along with the adiabatic oscillation equations , however , provide only the mechanical variables like pressure , density and sound speed .",
    "this provides us with the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean molecular weight . in order to determine separately @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath7 , it becomes necessary to use the equations of thermal equilibrium , i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the total energy generated within a sphere of radius @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath12 is the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath13 is the density and @xmath14 is the nuclear energy generation rate per unit mass . in addition , the equation of state needs to be adopted to relate the sound speed to chemical composition and temperature .",
    "equation  ( [ dtr ] ) is applicable when there is no convective transport of energy .",
    "this is generally true in the region below the outer convection zone , and we have verified that all the models considered in this work are stable to convection .    since we have only three equations , namely , equations ( [ dtr ] ) , ( [ dlr ] ) and the equation of state to determine the variables @xmath15 and the chemical abundances , it becomes possible to determine only one parameter specifying the composition , e.g. , the mean molecular weight .",
    "clearly the solution can not be unique and therefore , in this work we assume the heavy element abundance , @xmath3 to be prescribed and attempt to determine the hydrogen abundance ( @xmath16 ) as also the temperature .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath3 mainly affects the opacity in the solar interior , since the bulk of the energy generation takes place through the pp chain .",
    "thus , an increase in @xmath3 by 20% ( which is a reasonable estimate for possible errors in @xmath3 ) raises the opacity by about 815% , while the sound speed changes by no more than 0.2% , and the integrated luminosity changes by at most 0.4% .",
    "it is evident that the dominant effect of a change in the @xmath3 profile is on the opacities and in this work we do not make any attempt to separate the intrinsic errors in opacity tables from those arising due to uncertainties in the @xmath3 profiles .",
    "the opacity changes could be because of intrinsic errors in opacity tables or due to incorrect @xmath3 profiles and it becomes difficult to separate the two effects .",
    "one reason to keep the @xmath3 profile fixed is that the value of @xmath17 in the convection zone is known ( grevesse & noels @xcite ) and the change in the interior due to diffusion is not expected to be very large , being of the order of 10% ( proffitt @xcite ) or even less depending on treatment of diffusion ( richard et al .",
    ". we can thus assume the @xmath3 profile to be known to an accuracy of better than 20% .    in order to calculate the @xmath16 profile",
    "we express it in terms of suitable basis functions , e.g. , b - splines , by writing @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the cubic b - spline basis functions based on uniformly spaced knots .",
    "we use knots with a spacing of @xmath20 , which is found to be adequate to represent the @xmath16 profile to the level of accuracy expected from helioseismic inversions .",
    "we have tried experiments by increasing the number of knots to find that it does not have any significant effect on the solution . for a given set of coefficients",
    "@xmath21 it is possible to calculate @xmath16 and then the equation of state together with the known sound speed and density profiles determine the temperature profile . once the temperature , density and composition profiles are known we can integrate equation  ( [ dlr ] ) to calculate the luminosity , @xmath9 @xmath22 here the upper limit of integration can be suitably truncated since there is no significant energy generation in the outer layers .",
    "it may be noted that this equation is integrated from the outer boundary in order to prevent the errors in primary inversion near the center from contaminating the results in the outer region . with this approach , the errors in primary inversion near the center will only affect the secondary inversion in the central region .",
    "we use the nuclear reaction rates from bahcall & pinsonneault ( @xcite , hereinafter bp95 ) to calculate the nuclear energy generation rate @xmath14 .",
    "however , the cross - section for the pp reaction which has a dominant influence on nuclear energy generation rate in the sun , has decreased by about 4.5% in the last few years ( bahcall @xcite ; bp95 ) .",
    "we therefore , use both these values to estimate the influence of uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "most of the calculations have been performed using the older reaction rate for pp reaction , as that is found to give the computed luminosity closer to the observed value , @xmath23 .",
    "once the luminosity has been determined in the manner outlined above , we can substitute all the quantities in equation  ( [ dtr ] ) to obtain @xmath24 we use the recent opal opacities ( iglesias and rogers @xcite ) to estimate the ratio @xmath25 .",
    "if the equations of thermal equilibrium are exactly satisfied , this quantity would be unity everywhere , but in general that is not the case .",
    "the departures of @xmath25 from unity is a measure of the extent by which the opacity needs to be modified to satisfy the equations of thermal equilibrium for a composition profile prescribed by equation  ( [ xbsp ] ) , the coefficients in which can then be determined by minimizing the required opacity modifications .",
    "this outlines our prescription for calculating the composition and temperature profiles which may be regarded as defining a seismic solar model .",
    "it may be noted that generally with such a procedure the integrated luminosity will not turn out to be equal to the observed solar luminosity .",
    "we can adjust the nuclear energy generation rate to obtain the correct luminosity .    in order to implement this procedure",
    "we need to measure the required deviation of opacity .",
    "it would be simplest to use a least squares approach , where the integral of squared difference is minimized .",
    "thus we minimize the quantity @xmath26 where @xmath27 are a set of suitable mesh points spanning the radiative interior of the sun , @xmath28 is the computed luminosity in the seismic model and @xmath29 .",
    "we generally use a mesh with uniform spacing of @xmath30 , which gives approximately 145 points .",
    "thus we determine the @xmath16 profile by choosing the coefficients @xmath21 in equation  ( [ xbsp ] ) to minimize @xmath31 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath32 , this procedure may also be able to yield the correct solar luminosity without adjusting the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "thus , only the opacity deviations will be minimized for @xmath33 , while for large values of @xmath32 , the integrated luminosity can also tend to the solar luminosity at the expense of larger opacity variations . however , in general it is found that an adjustment of the luminosity is somewhat difficult because in the process the resulting composition profile as well as the required opacity modifications may become unacceptable .    in actual practice",
    "the function is linearized about some initial guess for the @xmath16 profile and least squares solution is calculated iteratively .",
    "apart from this simple technique we have also tried the technique of simulated annealing ( vanderbilt & louie @xcite ; press et al .",
    "@xcite ) to obtain the nonlinear least squares fit . since the convergence of simulated annealing technique is very slow , after some stage we switch to the linearized version to arrive at the final solution .",
    "it is not obvious that such a choice will indeed produce the correct @xmath16 profile since the actual errors in opacity may be larger than the minimum estimate , or the opacity modification may not be correctly estimated because of errors in the primary inversion or in the nuclear energy generation rates or in the adopted @xmath3 profile .",
    "the errors in the @xmath16 profile due to those in the primary inversions can be estimated by perturbing the inverted profiles of sound speed and density .",
    "for this purpose we repeat the primary inversions using a perturbed set of frequencies , where randomly distributed perturbations with variance equal to the quoted errors in frequencies are added to the input frequencies .",
    "however , it turns out that these errors are fairly small as compared to those introduced by uncertainties in opacities . for estimating the errors arising from uncertainties in opacities we try to determine the @xmath16 profile for various prescribed @xmath3 profiles .",
    "we use for this purpose one of the following three basic @xmath3 profiles : ( 1 ) a homogeneous profile ( denoted by hom ) without any diffusion of heavy elements , ( 2 ) a profile including diffusion ( proffitt @xcite ) indicated as prof , and ( 3 ) another profile using a different treatment of diffusion including some turbulent mixing just below the base of the convection zone ( richard et al .",
    "@xcite ) identified as rich .",
    "we scale all these profiles to give a prescribed value of @xmath3 at the solar surface , @xmath34 and the inversions are performed for a very large range of values for @xmath34 .    inside the convection zone",
    "we can determine the helium abundance independently ( gough @xcite ; dppen et al .",
    "@xcite ; dziembowski et al .",
    "@xcite ; kosovichev et al .",
    "@xcite ; antia & basu @xcite ; basu & antia  @xcite ) and the temperature can then be determined using the inverted sound speed . however , in this work we have restricted ourselves to the radiative interior only .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath16 at the base of the convection zone can be compared with the independently estimated values inside the convection zone .",
    "once the @xmath5 and @xmath16 profiles inside the sun are known it is straightforward to estimate the neutrino fluxes for the various solar neutrino experiments .    to    the representation  ( 6 ) takes care of both the modifications in the opacity and nuclear energy generation rate .",
    "thus , in the limit of @xmath33 we essentially recover the approach of st96 , for which the required opacity modification is negligible .",
    "when we try the least squares solution with @xmath33 , the resulting opacity modifications turn out to be generally very small and merely represent numerical errors .",
    "we have , in fact , verified that the two solutions are almost identical .",
    "most of the results in this paper have been obtained using this prescription . in our formulation by increasing the value of @xmath32 we can also find solutions which satisfy the luminosity constraint at the expense of allowing for some opacity variations .",
    "this approach would be similar to that of kosovichev  ( @xcite ) who has estimated @xmath3 variations , which is essentially equivalent to finding the opacity modifications .",
    "we thus have the choice of either modifying the nuclear energy generation rate to match the solar luminosity ( @xmath33 ) or to modify the opacities keeping the nuclear energy generation rate fixed ( @xmath35 ) to achieve the same purpose .",
    "naturally , by using intermediate values of @xmath32 we can obtain solutions which require modifications of both opacities and nuclear energy generation rates by varying amount .",
    "clearly the resulting solution is not unique , but all possible solutions may not be acceptable since some of them may require unacceptably large modifications in opacity or nuclear energy generation rates .",
    "of course , if we can get the observed solar luminosity for a solution with @xmath33 , then effectively no modification would be required in input microphysics .",
    "in fact , for some choices of nuclear reaction rates and opacities we do find such solutions where no significant modifications in microphysics are required .",
    "it should be stressed that our technique for inferring the @xmath5 and @xmath16 profiles in the solar interior is absolute , in the sense that no reference model is required and the actual profiles of @xmath5 and @xmath16 are determined directly from the sound speed and density profiles .",
    "of course , the density and sound speed are determined by using a differential technique where the differences are linearized about a reference model .    to",
    "we use data sets of @xmath36-mode frequencies from the gong data ( hill et al .",
    "@xcite ) and from the big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) data ( libbrecht et al .",
    "@xcite ) along with the low degree modes from bison data ( elsworth et al .  @xcite ) to infer the sound speed and density profiles using the regularized least squares technique ( antia @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained using different input frequencies are shown in fig .",
    "[ obsinv ] which displays the relative difference between inverted profiles and those in the model s of christensen - dalsgaard  et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen that the results obtained using different sets of frequencies agree with each other to within the estimated errors .",
    "the most significant difference in the sound speed between the model and the sun , occurs just below the base of the convection zone and is very likely on account of the @xmath16 profile in the sun being smoother than that in the model ( basu & antia @xcite ; gough et al .",
    "@xcite ; basu @xcite ) .",
    "apart from this , another noteworthy smaller hump occurs around @xmath37 which is opposite in sign to that below the convection zone .",
    "it is likely that in this region the @xmath16 profile in the sun is steeper than that in the model .",
    "the third minor hump around @xmath38 is not very significant and occurs in a region where the primary inversions are not likely to be in any case very reliable .",
    "similarly , the most significant difference in the density profile occurs inside the convection zone and is probably due to small errors in opacity , equation of state , surface abundances and/or the depth of the convection zone ( basu & antia @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the standard value of solar radius ( allen @xcite ) needs to be reduced ( antia @xcite ; schou et al .",
    "@xcite ) and it would be interesting to estimate the effect of error in the solar radius on helioseismic inversions .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ obsinv ] the results obtained using the standard value of 695.99 mm for the solar radius .",
    "we have also performed inversions with a reduced radius of 695.78 mm and fig .",
    "[ invrad ] compares the results obtained with two different values for solar radius using the same set of observed frequencies from gong months 410 data .",
    "it is clear that the small error in solar radius affects the inversion results to an extent which is much larger than the estimated errors due to those in frequencies .",
    "applying the procedure outlined in section  2 to the inverted profiles for sound speed and density shown in fig .",
    "[ obsinv ] , we obtain the @xmath5 and @xmath16 profiles and the results are shown in fig .",

    "all these results have been obtained with @xmath33 in equation  ( [ chisq ] ) and using the pp reaction rate from bahcall  ( @xcite ) .",
    "a @xmath3 profile including diffusion ( rich ) of heavy elements with surface value of @xmath39 was assumed for these inversions .",
    "once again it is clear that the results obtained using different input frequencies are close to one another .",
    "the computed luminosity in these seismic models turns out to be between 0.9650.993@xmath23 , which is roughly consistent with the actual solar luminosity .",
    "the errors in secondary inversions arising from estimated uncertainties in the input frequencies can be calculated with a monte - carlo simulation . for this purpose",
    "we generate 20 sets of artificial frequency data where randomly distributed errors with standard deviation equal to the estimated errors in observed frequencies are added to every input frequency before the primary inversion .",
    "the inverted sound speed and density profiles are then used to obtain the @xmath5 and @xmath16 profiles . the standard deviation in these profiles , at a fixed radius , will give an estimate of errors in secondary inversions arising from those in input frequencies .",
    "it turns out that the relative errors in the inferred values of @xmath5 are much smaller than those in @xmath16 , and clearly , the temperature gets determined much more reliably than the chemical composition in this procedure .    to    to",
    "we can also estimate the influence of error in adopted solar radius on the secondary inversions by using sound speed and density profiles obtained with different values of the radius and these results are shown in fig .",

    "this follows directly from the equations of thermal equilibrium ( eqs .",
    "( 1,2 ) ) . once the sound speed , density and @xmath3 profiles",
    "are known it is possible to integrate these equations to calculate the @xmath5 and @xmath9 profiles , which will depend only on the central temperature @xmath40 . clearly , by adjusting @xmath40",

    "it is clear that uncertainties in these profiles arising from those in @xmath3 are much larger than those due to other effects considered earlier .",

    "the shape of the @xmath16-profile near the base of the convection zone is essentially independent of @xmath34 , but depends on the actual profile used .",

    "since the surface hydrogen abundance @xmath48 and the mixing length parameter in these models are adjusted to get the correct radius and luminosity , the @xmath16 profile has to be scaled by multiplying it by a constant factor and as such the resulting model does not have the same abundance profile as that inferred from inversion .",

    "it is clear that the hump below the convection zone has more or less vanished .",
    "the discrepancy in sound speed within the convection zone is likely to be due to uncertainties in the equation of state or the error in estimated radius , or may arise from errors in inversion due to influence of surface layers ( antia @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen that for this model the sound speed and density are very close to those in the sun , more or less within the estimated errors in primary inversions .",
    "some of the remaining differences could be attributed to errors in opacities , equation of state or nuclear reaction rates , which have not been adjusted while constructing these models or on account of errors in primary inversions .",
    "it may be noted that the neutrino fluxes in this model as well as other seismic models listed in table  1 are significantly lower than those in the standard solar model of bp95 with diffusion of helium and heavy elements , and marginally higher than those in the solar model of turck - chize & lopes  ( @xcite ) , which does not incorporate any diffusion of elements .",
    "the nuclear energy generation in the solar interior is mainly controlled by the pp reaction rate .",
    "the theoretically estimated cross - section for this reaction varies from @xmath59 mev barns ( bp95 ) to @xmath60 mev barns ( turck - chize & lopes @xcite ) . for convenience",
    "we denote the usually accepted value ( bahcall @xcite ) by @xmath61 mev barns , and express the cross - section in terms of @xmath62 .",
    "recently , there has been a claim that the pp nuclear reaction rate should be revised upwards by a factor of 2.9 ( ivanov et al .",
    "although this claim has been contested ( bahcall & kamionkowski @xcite ) on the nuclear physics grounds , it would be nice to have an independent check from helioseismic data ( deglinnocenti et al .",
    "the inverted profiles for @xmath5 and @xmath16 can be used to compute the total luminosity generated in the seismic models provided the nuclear reaction rates are assumed to be known . with the requirement that the sun is in thermal equilibrium , the computed luminosity should agree with the observed value and that would impose some constraint on the nuclear reaction rates .",
    "however , as we have seen in the previous section , the inverted profiles depend on the assumed profile for heavy element abundance .",
    "we therefore , investigate the effect of an assumed @xmath3 profile on integrated luminosity to constrain the nuclear reaction rate .    apart from the @xmath3 profile , there could also be uncertainties in the theoretically calculated values of opacities . in order to obtain constraints",
    "which are independent of errors in opacity we can consider @xmath16 profiles , with coefficients in equation  ( [ xbsp ] ) chosen arbitrarily .",
    "these arbitrary profiles may not satisfy the equations of thermal equilibrium with any reasonable estimate for opacities .",
    "however , using the inverted sound speed and assuming the @xmath16 and @xmath3 profiles , it is possible to calculate the temperature profile inside the sun .",
    "once these thermal and composition profiles are known , the luminosity in corresponding seismic models can be computed . in order to estimate an upper limit on the pp nuclear reaction rate we can try to construct a profile which generates the minimum energy for the given sound speed and density profiles . since the sound speed essentially constrains the value of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean molecular weight of the solar material , it seems in order to cut down the energy generation one should reduce @xmath5 as well as @xmath7 to keep the ratio constant .",
    "it is clear that the minimum value of @xmath7 is achieved when @xmath63 and @xmath64 , i.e. when there is no helium or heavy elements present in the central region . from more detailed calculation of energy generation rate",
    ", we have verified that this is indeed true , although strictly speaking , since the temperature is not high enough for helium burning reactions , the minimum energy generation occurs when @xmath65 , when there is no fuel to burn ! but even a value of @xmath66 gives much higher energy generation rate as compared to @xmath67 in the core , because the temperature has to be increased when @xmath16 decreases to keep the sound speed constant .",
    "further , if the temperature is required to decrease monotonically with radial distance , then even such profiles can be ruled out .",
    "thus , leaving aside this unlikely possibility , the minimum energy generation occurs when @xmath63 and @xmath64 , when there is no helium in the core ( @xmath68 ) .    for the case of a profile with @xmath63 and @xmath64 we can easily demonstrate that the computed luminosity in the resulting seismic model is about @xmath69 when the usual nuclear reaction rates are adopted .",
    "now if we increase the pp nuclear reaction rate for obtaining the correct solar luminosity with this profile , it turns out that the cross - section needs to be increased to about @xmath70 .",
    "it is clear that if the cross - section is increased beyond this value it is not possible to find any @xmath16 profile ( apart from the one where hydrogen is almost totally exhausted throughout the solar core ) , which will simultaneously yield the correct sound speed and luminosity in seismic models .",
    "the exact limiting value of the cross - section will depend on the inverted sound speed and density profiles , but as we have seen in the previous section these uncertainties are very small .",
    "we can therefore , conclude that any value higher than @xmath71 is inadmissible even if arbitrary errors in opacities are allowed and the sun is assumed to generate the observed luminosity . an increase in the pp nuclear reaction rate by a factor of 2.9 ( ivanov et al .",
    "@xcite ) is certainly ruled out by the helioseismic data .",
    "in fact , in actual practice even the profile with @xmath68 considered in obtaining this limit is unacceptable since one would expect significant amount of helium to be present in the solar core . if we consider a profile with @xmath72 , which is still lower than the expected helium abundance , the limiting cross - section for the pp reaction drops to @xmath73 .",
    "it is therefore evident that , any significant increase in the pp cross - section is demonstably inconsistent with helioseismic constraints .",
    "we would like to add that there is no straightforward way to set a lower bound on this cross - section from such an analysis , as by increasing the helium abundance suitably it is possible to reproduce the solar luminosity even when this cross - section is significantly reduced , although such profiles may require inadmissibly large opacity modifications .",
    "in the foregoing discussion we have allowed for arbitrary errors in standard opacity tables . even though such an analysis helps in illustrating that the helioseismic data are able to put severe constraints on nuclear reaction rates , the resulting bounds on cross - section are highly conservative and are unlikely to be achieved in realistic situations .",
    "it would be possible to obtain more meaningful bounds if one allows only reasonable errors in opacities .",
    "there are two problems with this approach ; first , it is difficult to define what is a reasonable error in opacity and second , the error in opacities may have arbitrary variation with temperature and density , thus making it difficult to consider all possible variations even within the assumed limits .",
    "one possibility is to use the procedure outlined in the section  2 with a suitably large value of @xmath32 in equation  ( [ chisq ] ) , to obtain the @xmath16 profile which generates the correct luminosity and requires some minimum opacity variation for any specified nuclear reaction rates .",
    "we consider this approach later , but before that we adopt a simpler procedure by taking different @xmath3 profiles with a large range of @xmath34 to see how the computed luminosity varies with @xmath3 . in this process",
    ", the opacity changes are accounted through changes in @xmath3 profiles .    using the @xmath3 profile with diffusion ( proffitt @xcite )",
    "scaled to different values of @xmath34 we can calculate the @xmath16 profiles following the procedure outlined in section  2 , with @xmath33 in equation  ( [ chisq ] ) .",
    "the total luminosity and neutrino fluxes in the resulting seismic models are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the integrated luminosity goes up with @xmath34 as a result of increase in opacities , but not very significantly  a variation of @xmath34 from 0 to 0.06 , results in an increase in the luminosity from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",
    "the range of @xmath3 values covered by these models is in all probability much more than the expected uncertainties in the @xmath3 profile . with the allowance of a factor of two variation in @xmath34 ,",
    "one gets an error of about 5% in computed luminosity .",
    "an uncertainty by a factor of two is probably the most that is expected in @xmath3 , and hence we have only considered profiles where @xmath3 is scaled uniformly by the same factor . a slightly smaller change in @xmath3 in selected regions may also give rise to similar change in the resultant luminosity . from the results presented later where we try to adjust the @xmath3 profile to match the luminosity",
    ", it turns out that the required maximum change in @xmath3 is not much smaller than what is indicated by this simple analysis . for the purpose of this work",
    "we therefore estimate a reasonable error of 5% in the luminosity arising from possible uncertainties in the heavy element abundance and/or opacities . since this is much larger than the estimated uncertainties from other sources we assume a total uncertainty of 5% in computed luminosity .",
    "there are uncertainties in other nuclear reaction rates which will also affect the computed luminosity , but again if these are within limits given by bp95 , the error in luminosity from these is only about 12% .",
    "thus the integrated luminosity is consistent with the observed value within these uncertainties for a reasonable @xmath3 profile .",
    "it may be noted that all these results are obtained using the pp reaction cross - section to be @xmath62 .",
    "if the recent value adopted by bp95 ( @xmath76 ) was used , the computed luminosity would be about 4% lower , while for the normal value of @xmath3 the computed luminosity would be significantly lower than the observed value .",
    "this leads us to surmise that the cross - section for the pp - reaction rate needs to be increased to its earlier value given by bahcall ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar conclusions were also reached earlier by antia & chitre ( @xcite ) .    in order to obtain a better estimate for the cross - section of pp reaction",
    ", we try to compute the luminosity using different values for the cross - section of the pp reaction , with the normal value of @xmath55 . from these results",
    "we can identify the range of cross - section values which yield the computed luminosity within 5% of the observed value .",
    "this can be treated as the helioseismic estimate for the cross - section of pp reaction , which turns out to be @xmath0 mev barns , where the quoted errors correspond to an uncertainty of 5% in the computed luminosity .",
    "this range is consistent with the value adopted by bahcall  ( @xcite ) , but slightly larger than the more recent value adopted by bp95 .",
    "all the inversion results presented so far were obtained using @xmath33 in equation  ( [ chisq ] ) , which yield profiles that require no opacity modifications , but the computed luminosity may not match the observed value .",
    "it is possible to adjust the opacity or equivalently the heavy element abundance to obtain the correct observed luminosity by choosing a suitably large value of @xmath32 in equation  ( [ chisq ] ) .",
    "however , such profiles may not be unique as only one parameter namely , the luminosity is fitted by adjusting the @xmath3-profile in radiative interior .",
    "nevertheless , we can obtain a possible solution which yields a seismic model with correct luminosity .",
    "we use the nuclear reaction rates as adopted by bp95 ( including that of pp reaction ) for this study",
    ". then the computed luminosity turns out to be about @xmath77 for the case of @xmath33 ( i.e. , no opacity modifications ) , but if we choose a large value of @xmath32 , say @xmath78 , the computed luminosity comes out to be close to the observed value .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath25 at each point can then be converted to equivalent variation in @xmath3 , and this gives the @xmath3 profile required to obtain the correct total solar luminosity .",
    "for this purpose we use the technique of simulated annealing to minimize the function @xmath31 defined by equation  ( [ chisq ] ) .",
    "once the iteration is close to convergence we linearize about that solution and determine the actual @xmath16 profile .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 and @xmath16 profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ invlum ] , while fig .",
    "[ zinv ] shows the required @xmath3 profile .",
    "these figures also show the estimated errors arising from those in frequencies .",
    "if the cross - section for the pp nuclear reaction is taken to be @xmath62 then the required increase in integrated luminosity is much smaller and the resulting profiles are also shown in figs .",
    "[ invlum ] and [ zinv ] .",
    "it is clear from these figures that with the bp95 reaction rates the profiles need to be modified significantly to generate the extra luminosity and the resulting @xmath3 profile in the central regions does not look particularly realistic , as there is an unrealistic hump in the core .",
    "thus , it appears that @xmath3 needs to be increased by about a factor of two to obtain the correct luminosity when the nuclear reaction rates as adopted by bp95 are used . if the @xmath3 profile is uniformly scaled by a constant factor ( cf . ,",
    "[ lum ] ) of two , there will be a similar change in the luminosity .",
    "further , the estimated errors are also larger than those in fig .",
    "[ invtx ] , because the profiles are more sensitive to errors in primary inversions when the luminosity constraint is applied .",
    "when the pp nuclear reaction rate is adopted from bahcall  ( 1989 ) the resulting @xmath3 profile still has the same shape as before , but the height of the hump is much less and it is within @xmath79 of the usual @xmath3 profiles including diffusion .",
    "the sensitivity of inverted profiles to nuclear reaction rates is probably due to helioseismic constraints which are being applied in this work . since the density and sound speed are known from primary inversion , in order to maintain the observed solar luminosity with the reduced nuclear reaction rates , the temperature will need to be increased .",
    "the sound speed constraint from the primary inversions fixes the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "the mean molecular weight @xmath7 will also have to be increased , implying a decrease in the hydrogen abundance @xmath16 .",
    "this will work against enhancing the energy production , and as a result , temperature will have to be increased substantially to keep up with the required nuclear energy production for maintaining the observed luminosity .",
    "if we allow for the departures from the inverted sound speed and density profiles then it may be possible to obtain the correct luminosity without much modification in @xmath3 , but the resulting seismic model will not have the inferred sound speed in the core .",
    "in this work we have shown that the use of sound speed and density profiles obtained from primary inversions enables us to infer the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles , provided the heavy element abundance profile as well as the microphysics like the equation of state , opacities and nuclear energy generation rates are known .",
    "the profiles so determined would define a seismic model , although the integrated luminosity in these seismic models may not necessarily match the observed value .",
    "the difference may arise due to uncertainties in primary inversions , and/or the assumed @xmath3 profile , and/or the microphysics .",
    "while it is possible to adjust the @xmath3 profile to yield the observed luminosity , it is not clear if that is the correct solution , since the discrepancy may arise due to other reasons .",
    "we have attempted to estimate the extent to which various uncertainties can influence the luminosity to find that the effect of equation of state or primary inversions on computed luminosity to be fairly small .",
    "the dominant uncertainty arises from the nuclear reaction rates and opacities ( or equivalently the @xmath3 profile ) .",
    "it is difficult to separate out the influence of these two factors , but if we assume a reasonable error in one of these the other effect can be quantified .",
    "it turns out that if we use the nuclear reaction rates adopted by bp95 , except for the pp reaction for which the older reaction rate from bahcall  ( @xcite ) is used , then the integrated luminosity with the normal @xmath3 profile is close to the observed value .",
    "it is thus tempting to conclude that these nuclear reaction rates , together with the current opacity tables and a @xmath3 profile including diffusion are consistent with helioseismic data .",
    "similarly , from a detailed study of the base of the convection zone it appears that uncertainties in the current opacities at the base of the convection zone as well as the estimated @xmath17 values ( grevesse & noels @xcite ) are fairly small ( basu & antia @xcite ) .",
    "one expects opacities to be more reliably determined in the solar core where temperatures are upwards of several million degrees .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that there are no significant uncertainties in current opal opacity tables in the solar core .",
    "of course , there could be some error on account of an inappropriate @xmath3 diffusion profile , but that is not expected to be too large .",
    "it is remarkable that , different values of cross - section for the pp - reaction have been adopted by various workers ( bahcall @xcite ; bp95 ; turck - chize & lopes @xcite ; dar & shaviv @xcite ) and recently ivanov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have even suggested an increase in the pp reaction rate by a factor of 2.9 .",
    "since there is no experimental measurement of this cross - section , it would be interesting to indulge in an exercise to estimate this cross - section helioseismically . from our results in the previous section",
    "it is clear that an increase in this reaction rate by a factor of 2.9 is essentially ruled out , even when arbitrary variations in opacities are allowed .",
    "the only @xmath16 profiles which may yield the computed luminosity as low as the observed value with such nuclear reaction rates are those where hydrogen is almost completely exhausted ( @xmath80 ) in most of the core .",
    "in fact , even an increase by a factor of 1.65 in the pp reaction rate is inconsistent with helioseismic data , with no restriction on opacity . if the helium abundance is constrained to a minimum of 0.2 , then this limiting factor",
    "is decreased to 1.3 .",
    "thus we can firmly conclude that even a 30% increase in the cross - section for pp reaction is inconsistent with helioseismic data .",
    "however , these bounds are too conservative since unrestricted errors in opacity are permitted .",
    "should we make the assumption , on the other hand that opacities are known to reasonable accuracy and that there is an uncertainty of up to a factor of two in @xmath34 , then this translates into an uncertainty of 5% in computed luminosity and the estimated value of the cross - section for the pp reaction turns out to be @xmath0 mev barns .",
    "this value is consistent with the estimate of @xmath81 mev barns ( bahcall @xcite ; dar & shaviv @xcite ) or @xmath60 mev barns ( turck - chize & lopes @xcite ) , but slightly larger than the value of @xmath59 mev barns adopted by bp95 .",
    "it thus appears that the estimate of the pp reaction cross - section adopted by bp95 , needs to be increased by a few percent . with the adoption of the recent estimate of this cross - section",
    ", the @xmath3 profile will need to be modified by about a factor of two to obtain the correct computed luminosity .",
    "we can not , of course , strictly rule out such @xmath3 profiles , but they appear unlikely to be realized in practice .    the reliability of the inverted seismic profiles from the observed frequencies can be demonstrated by constructing a model ( inv ) with the inverted @xmath16 profile .",
    "this model is found to be close to observations in many respects including the sound speed and density profiles through the solar interior .",
    "thus , the base of the convection zone in model inv is found to be at a radial distance of @xmath82 , which is consistent with the helioseismically estimated value ( christensen - dalsgaard  et al .",
    "@xcite ; basu and antia @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the helium abundance in the envelope of this model is found to be 0.2469 , which is also close to the helioseismically estimated value ( basu and antia @xcite ) .",
    "this appears to indicate that the inverted @xmath16 profile used in this model is close to that in the sun .",
    "note that this model has been constructed using the standard opal opacities and equation of state .",
    "it should be recognized that this model satisfying the seismic constraints is probably not unique , as it may be possible to construct different solar models satisfying the helioseismic constraints by modifying the opacities or nuclear reaction rates or the @xmath3 profiles suitably .",
    "the inverted @xmath5 and @xmath16 profiles are found to be close to those in the model s of christensen - dalsgaard  et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed that our technique is absolute in nature , and hence the fact that the resultant inverted profiles are close to those of a standard solar model can not be a coincidence , since the model profiles have not been used anywhere during the secondary inversion .",
    "our results , therefore , appear to demonstrate that the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles in the sun are close to those in a standard solar model .",
    "the major noticeable difference arises just below the base of the convection zone , where the inverted @xmath16 profile is smoother than that in the standard model .",
    "the @xmath16 profile is in fact , sensibly flat in the region @xmath83 .",
    "this is probably owing to some process involving turbulent diffusion just below the base of the convection zone , which is not accounted for in the usual treatment of diffusion ( richard et al .",
    "such a mixing could smoothen the composition gradient and also explain the anomalously low lithium abundance in the solar photosphere .",
    "it should be stressed that the estimated uncertainties due to errors in the @xmath3 profile are fairly large and consequently , significance of the flatness of the profile may not be obvious .",
    "however , a mere increase or decrease in the opacity by a constant factor will not change the nature of the profile as similar results can be obtained for different values of @xmath34 .",
    "only if there is a sharp gradient in modified opacity over this narrow region ( or equivalently a sharp gradient in the @xmath3 profile ) it will be possible to obtain composition profiles which are not flat just below the convection zone . if the gradient in @xmath3 profile were to be increased by a factor of five over that in proffitt  ( @xcite ) , it would be possible to get an @xmath16 profile with gradient similar to that in model  s at the base of the convection zone .",
    "thus , composition profiles obtained using similar treatment of diffusion for both helium and heavy elements are not consistent with inverted profiles unless the gradient vanishes as in the case of turbulent mixing ( richard et al .",
    "these results are consistent with conclusions drawn from the oscillatory signal in the frequencies ( basu & antia @xcite ; basu @xcite ) , which also supports the presence of turbulent mixing in this region .",
    "similar evidence is also suggested by the inversion of sound speed ( gough et al .",
    "all this seems to indicate that the region just below the convection zone is probably mixed ( richard et al .",
    "@xcite ) by some process .",
    "in contrast , in the central region around @xmath58 the composition profile in the sun appears to be steeper than that in the solar model , perhaps suggesting that mixing is unlikely to have occurred in this region of solar interior . from fig .",
    "[ invtx ] it can be seen that @xmath84 has a negative gradient in the inner core around @xmath85 , which would imply that the @xmath16 profile in the sun is smoother than that in the model .",
    "this difference has presumably been considered as a hint of mixing in the core ( gough et al .",
    "however , considering the fact that the @xmath16 gradient is very steep in this region , the difference is extremely small and mixing if any , could only have taken place in the very early history of solar evolution or the mixing process is extremely slow . a more likely cause of this difference is the errors in nuclear reaction rates .",
    "it is also possible that this difference could arise from uncertainties in the primary inversion in the core .    using the inverted @xmath5 and @xmath16 profiles it is possible to estimate the neutrino fluxes . from the results in table  1",
    ", it appears that these neutrino fluxes are significantly lower than those in the standard solar model of bp95 , with diffusion of helium and heavy elements .",
    "some of the difference could be due to somewhat lower cross - section for pp reaction used by bp95 .",
    "a part of the difference will also arise from the diffusion of heavy elements .",
    "as argued earlier there are good reasons to believe that the region immediately below the convection zone is mixed and hence the heavy element abundance will not increase as steeply as in the model of bp95 . a reduction in @xmath3 value inside the core will reduce the opacities and hence the temperature and the corresponding neutrino fluxes .",
    "however , the computed neutrino fluxes in seismic models are significantly larger than the observed values .",
    "in fact , it has been found ( antia & chitre @xcite ) that even if arbitrary variations in opacities are allowed it is not possible to reduce the neutrino fluxes in any two solar neutrino experiments simultaneously to the observed values .",
    "thus , it appears that the solution of solar neutrino problem should be sought in terms of neutrino properties , though the seismic models can be used to constrain these solutions .",
    "since the neutrino fluxes in the standard solar model of bp95 are somewhat different from those in the seismic models , the constraints on the particle physics solution ( e.g. , hata & langacker @xcite ) could change when seismic models are used .",
    "we have demonstrated that our inversion technique produces reasonably well the thermal and composition profiles in the sun s interior , with the knowledge of the sound speed and density inferred from the accurately observed frequencies , based on the mechanical and thermal equilibrium constraints governing the solar structure .",
    "these seismically determined temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles in the sun turn out to be close to those obtained with a standard solar model .",
    "the small departures could be due to a variety of processes arising from diffusion and uncertainties in nuclear reaction rates , equation of state , heavy element abundances or even the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it is remarkable that the neutrino fluxes in the framework of the seismic model come out to be close to those predicted by the standard solar model , assuming that the opacities are not very different from the currently accepted opal values .",
