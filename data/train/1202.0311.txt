    "while the gaseous atmospheres of galaxy clusters are virialized , they are often far from relaxed .",
    "cooling gas can condense , form stars , and funnel down to the central galaxy to feed the supermassive black hole in its center .",
    "gas can enter the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) through accretion from cosmic filaments , ram pressure stripping of galaxies , jets emanating from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and galactic outflows due to supernova explosions .",
    "the icm has characteristic temperatures @xmath1 kev and central densities of order @xmath2 , implying that the cooling time of the central cluster gas in many clusters is much shorter than the hubble time .",
    "however , observations with _ xmm - newton _ and the _ chandra _ x - ray telescope ( cxo ) over the past decade have shown that cooling to temperatures below about 1.5 kev is suppressed .",
    "in order for the gas in the icm to maintain its temperatures over time , energy must be added to counterbalance the radiative energy losses .",
    "extragalactic jets from agn can provide this counterbalance due to the very large energies injected into the icm .",
    "provide an excellent overview of the current paradigm of agn feedback .",
    "it is now well established that jet feedback happens through inflation of x - ray cavities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "at a minimum , the jets have to supply enough energy to create the enthalpy associated with the radio bubbles / x - ray cavities they inflate in the icm by pushing aside the icm and filling these cavities with synchrotron emitting particles .",
    "the estimates of the enthalpy ( @xmath3 ) from observed cavities suggest that agn can indeed provide sufficient energy , though much of this energy has a non - thermal form : the bubbles store up to 75% of it as non - thermal internal energy .",
    "depending on the inflation dynamics , an appreciable fraction of the remaining energy can go into sound or shock waves . in order to understand how feedback works as a process",
    ", it is important to understand how much of this energy is thermalized , and where .",
    "agn are among the most highly variable phenomena , and jets in particular are well known for being non - stationary .",
    "it has been suggested that observations of multiple generations of cavities and successive concentric shock and sound waves in many clusters are evidence for strong variability on duty - cycle time scales of order 1 - 10 million years , though dynamic instabilities , buoyancy , and shear within the jets themselves can also account for some of these observations @xcite .",
    "a detached cavity / bubble will buoyantly rise through the icm , moving further away from the central agn , while the agn creates a new bubble and an associated outgoing shock wave . while individual clusters only afford us a snapshot view of this process",
    ", the multiple generations of bubbles and waves observed in a number of nearby clusters , and the high frequency of bubbles in cool core clusters suggest that this process is constantly ongoing , filling the cluster with a spectrum of bubbles and waves @xcite .",
    "an increasing body of observations provides direct evidence of weak shocks and non - linear sound waves in clusters with central radio galaxies @xcite . as they propagate outward",
    ", these waves must interact with previously inflated bubbles .",
    "this interaction and the possible effect it can have on the thermodynamics of the cluster is the subject of this paper .",
    "@xcite ( henceforth abbreviated as hc05 ) provided a two dimensional study of shock  bubble interactions .",
    "while sound waves and weak shocks themselves have low efficiencies for ( non - adiabatic ) dissipation ( sound waves are completely non - dissipative in the absence of viscosity or thermal conduction ) , hc05 suggested that the dynamics of the interaction of waves with previously inflated bubbles could extract energy from the shock / sound wave and transform it to heat .",
    "this potential heating mechanism for the icm derives from the richtmyer - meshkov instability ( rmi ) @xcite which operates when a shock encounters a curved interface between two fluids . the proposed mechanism could work in concert with other forms of icm heating by shock waves and bubbles previously proposed in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the interaction of a shock wave with underdense bubbles has been investigated in a broad body of work in the broader fluid dynamical community , both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . however ,",
    "none of these papers discuss the prospect of the ensuing visco - rotational heating , and the extraction of rotational kinetic energy suggested by hc05 .",
    "many previous studies examined the rmi through the use of 2d simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such a treatment necessarily excludes the impact of any movement of material through the plane of simulation , eliminating some important aspects of vorticity generation , as we will show in this paper .    , and",

    "a more important requirement for effective heating is that the vortex remain in the cluster core long enough to dissipate a significant fraction of its energy .",
    "the vortex residence time in the cluster is more difficult to estimate than the dissipation time : our simulations are idealized in that they model the shock as a semi - infinite piston . and shocks and non - linear sound waves in clusters are impulsive , and thus the long term dynamics of the vortex might be different from our idealized simulations .    with this caveat in mind ,",

    "even if the dissipation time is short compared to the travel time and the cooling time , a sufficient amount of energy has to be injected into waves and then extracted into the vortex field , which depends on the filling factor of cavities in clusters and the on agn energy output relative to the cooling rate .",
    "as already shown in hc05 , the attenuation length of a wave with width @xmath163 interacting with a field of underdense bubbles of filling factor @xmath164 is roughly @xmath165 where we have included the factor 2 increase in efficiency introduced by extending the analysis to 3d .",
    "for the wave to lose most of its energy within the cooling radius , the filling factor would have to be larger than @xmath166    given that all cool core clusters show clear evidence of bubbles , and in cases where statistics allow , multiple generations thereof , such large filling factors are not unreasonable and consistent with estimates of the amount of non - thermal pressure present in the icm of nearby clusters .",
    "while the uncertainty in the relevant parameters ( namely , the distribution of @xmath167 of radio plasma , and the filling factor @xmath164 , the spitzer fraction @xmath168 ) is too large to conclude that visco - rotational heating is an important contributor to the thermal evolution , the study shows that the process should be studied further : it is clear that it _ must _ happen at some level when agn - driven waves pass over the existing pockets of radio plasma , and under the right conditions , it can be very important in the extraction of energy from sound and shock waves in clusters .",

    "lastly , strong shocks will raise the temperature of the gas on their own can , eliminating the requirement for additional dissipation mechanisms to facilitate agn energy deposition in response to cluster cooling .",
    "we found that non - linear interactions of multiple vortices can dynamically disrupt the vortices , leading to enhanced dissipation and a rapid decline in the kinetic energy in the vortex field , similar to what is seen in the case of large mach numbers . while further investigation of this effect is necessary ,",

    "the efficiency of vortex generation and dissipation will depend on the average distance between vortices , i.e. , the volume filling factor of low density plasma , with values significantly in excess of a few % indicating strongly non - linear interaction between vortices .",

    "<S> compared to the two - dimensional case , the 3-dimensional richtmyer - meshkov instability is about a factor of 2 more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> the energy in the vortex field for weak shocks is @xmath0 ( with dependence on the geometry , density contrast , and shock width ) . for strong shocks , </S>",
    "<S> the vortex becomes dynamically unstable , quickly dissipating its energy via a turbulent cascade . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a number of diagnostics for observations and laboratory experiments of shock - bubble interactions , like the shock - vortex standoff distance , which can be used to derive lower limits on the mach number . </S>",
    "<S> the differential rotation of the vortex field leads to viscous dissipation , which is sufficiently efficient to react to cluster cooling and to dissipate the vortex energy within the cooling radius of the cluster for a reasonable range of vortex parameters . for sufficiently large filling factors </S>",
    "<S> ( of order a few percent or larger ) , this process could thus contribute significantly to agn feedback in galaxy clusters . </S>"
