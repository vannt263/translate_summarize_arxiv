    "quantum correlations plays an important role for quantum protocols which outperform those of the classical one . the typical protocols are those proposed in the literature , such as the quantum cryptography @xcite , teleportation @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite , which depend crucially on the entanglement between the considered system .",
    "while quantum entanglement has been recognized as crucial for various quantum information processing tasks , recent investigations show that it is in fact a special kind of quantum correlation measure , and there are other forms of quantum correlations which are more fundamental than that of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the typical and seminal one are the concept of quantum discord proposed by ollivier and zurek @xcite , and henderson and vedral @xcite , which can exist even for the separable states , and is considered to be responsible for the power of the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit @xcite . due to these reasons and its fundamentals in quantum mechanics @xcite , great efforts has been devoted to this attractive field in the pat few years .    the quantum discord , although is favored for its operational interpretation and possible application , is very hard to calculate @xcite . to avoid this problem , luo and fu @xcite introduced a geometric description of quantum correlation which they termed as measurement - induced nonlocality ( min ) . as its name implies ,",
    "the min can also be considered as a measure of nonlocality for it is defined via the maximal global disturbance of the locally invariant measurements , and it is in some sense more general than that of the bell - type nonlocality . moreover",
    ", the geometric min can also be evaluated analytically for the two - qubit states .    besides the geometric min , an entropic measure of min based on the von neumann entropy was introduced recently @xcite , which is equivalent to that defined via the relative entropy @xcite . although its calculation is harder than that of the geometric one , it was favored for its definite physical meaning , which can be interpreted as the maximal increment of one s uncertainty about a system after his local invariant measurements on one subsystem .    in this work ,",
    "we study effects of the anisotropic parameter and the external magnetic field on the above two scenarios of min for a heisenberg xy chain .",
    "the structure of this paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] , we recall the concept of the geometric and entropc min , and the model of the xy chain we considered . then in section [ sec:3 ] , we examine behaviors of the min in the xy chain with different system parameters .",
    "we summarize the main finding of this work in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "here we first recall the concept of min . in its original geometric quantification scheme @xcite ,",
    "it was defined by the square of the maximum of the schatten 2-norm between two states @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which corresponds to the bipartite states before and after the projective measurements . to be explicitly ,",
    "we can write it as follows @xmath4 with the maximum being taken over the local projective measurements @xmath5 on subsystem @xmath6 , which satisfy the condition @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , @xmath8 is the schatten 2-norm where @xmath9 .    for the @xmath10 dimensional states , solutions of the geometric min can be derived analytically . here for convenience of representation , we do not list its explicit expressions , and the readers who are interested in it can resort to the ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail .",
    "different from @xmath11 which measures the min from a geometric perspective , the entropic measure of min is defined as follows @xcite @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the quantum mutual information , and the minimum is taken over the same projective measurements as that in the definition of @xmath11 .",
    "this min quantifies the maximal loss of total correlations under non - disturbing local measurements , and it is equivalent to @xmath14-s(\\rho)$ ] because of the definition of @xmath15 which leaves @xmath16 invariant .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath17 is also difficult due to the optimization processor involved .",
    "but for the special case that the bipartite states @xmath2 having nondegenerate @xmath16 , the optimal @xmath15 for obtaining the entropic min correspond to that of the spectral resolutions of @xmath18 , and thus @xmath17 can be evaluated easily .",
    "after review of the basic formalism for min , we present the model we considered in this paper .",
    "this is the usual two - spin heisenberg xy chain with uniform external magnetic field applies along the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath1 denotes the strength of the external magnetic field , and @xmath0 measures the anisotropy of the system which reduces to the xx model for @xmath21 , and the ising model for @xmath22 .",
    "after a straightforward algebra , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath23 can be derived analytically as @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and the normalization parameter @xmath27 .",
    "based on the above eigenvalues and eigenvectors , we can now evaluate the min in the xy chain , and for this purpose , we need to introduce the notion of the thermal state @xmath28 , with @xmath29 $ ] being the partition function , @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath31 denotes the temperature . when @xmath32 , @xmath2 reduces to the so - called ground state .",
    "we now begin our discussion about behaviors of min in the xy chain . to be explicitly , we will evaluate influence of the anisotropic parameter @xmath0 , strength of the external magnetic field @xmath1 , and the temperature @xmath31 on min .",
    "we first consider the scenario of the geometric min . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we gave three - dimensional plots of the geometric min @xmath11 as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath33 for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "when considering the case of ground states at absolute zero temperature , one can see clearly that for the isotropic xy chain ( i.e. , @xmath21 , for which it is also termed as the xx chain ) , @xmath11 keeps the constant value of 0.5 before the critical point @xmath34 , and disappears suddenly when @xmath35 .",
    "this sudden death behavior occurs only for the case of @xmath21 , and for finite @xmath0 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) , @xmath11 maintains the constant value 0.5 before @xmath36 , and decreases exponentially to zero in the infinite limit of @xmath1 .",
    "but when the anisotropic parameter @xmath0 exceeds a critical point @xmath37 , such as that displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](c ) with @xmath38 , @xmath11 initially keeps the maximum value 0.5 , and then decreases suddenly to a finite value @xmath39 at @xmath40 , after which it revivals and then decreases gradually to zero .",
    "this is one of the main difference between @xmath11 in the regions of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which implies that the anisotropic parameter @xmath0 can serve as an efficient parameter for tuning magnitudes of the min .",
    "finally , we displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](d ) behaviors of @xmath11 for the special case of @xmath22 which corresponds to the ising chain .",
    "different from those for @xmath43 , here @xmath11 decreases gradually from its maximum 1 to zero with increasing magnetic field @xmath1 .    for thermal states with finite temperatures ,",
    "one may expects that the min @xmath11 may be decreased by increasing the temperature , and this is indeed the case for weak magnetic fields .",
    "but there is a peculiar phenomenon needs to be pay attention to . as can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) , the min may be increased by increasing temperature in the region of relative strong external magnetic field .",
    "this shows again the combined effects of temperature and the anisotropic parameter on the geometric min .    from the above discussion",
    ", one can see that the geometric min @xmath11 is sensitive to the parameter @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we now turn to investigate behaviors of the entropic min in the xy chain .",
    "the exemplified plots are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where the entropic min @xmath17 are plotted as functions of magnetic field @xmath1 and the scaled temperature @xmath33 with different anisotropic parameters @xmath0 . from these plots one can observe that for relative small values of @xmath0 , e.g. , the case of @xmath21 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and @xmath44 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , @xmath17 exhibit similar behaviors as those for @xmath11 with the same parameters [ see , fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) ] , and the only difference is that the constant value for @xmath17 is twice that of @xmath11 . for large values of @xmath0",
    ", however , @xmath17 and @xmath11 exhibit completely different behaviors , which is more evident in the low temperature region . as can be seen from fig . [ fig:2](c ) and ( d ) , @xmath17 is an non - increasing function of @xmath1 for any fixed @xmath33 , and there are no revival of @xmath17 , even at zero absolute temperature .",
    "this is the first difference between geometric and entropic description of min in the heisenberg xy chain . besides this",
    ", one can also note that the min @xmath17 can be increased by increasing temperature in the whole region of @xmath0 with appropriate chosen magnetic fields , and this constitutes another main difference between @xmath17 and @xmath11 in describing the nonlocal property of the heisenberg xy chain .    before ending this section",
    ", we would like to point out that here the different behaviors between @xmath17 and @xmath11 for the heisenberg xy chain is caused by the different metric adopted for defining the min .",
    "this reveals the relativity of different quantum correlation measures in quantifying a specific quantum system @xcite , and the searching of an universal scheme for quantifying correlations remains an open problem needs to be solved in future .",
    "to summarize , we have studied influence of the anisotropic parameter @xmath0 and strength of the external magnetic field @xmath1 on behaviors of the min . through detailed calculation and comparison",
    ", we showed that both of them can serve as efficient parameters for controlling magnitudes of min in the heisenberg xy chain .",
    "we also showed that the geometric measure of min and the entropic measure of min may correspond to completely different behaviors of nonlocal correlations , and we interpret this phenomenon as the different metric adopted in their respective definition .",
    "as the min is a well - defined measure of nonlocal correlations , and investigations of its properties in different quantum systems will provide us with useful information which includes its controlling methods , its potential applications and other aspects related to the fundamental problem of quantum mechanics , we hope our work presented here may shed light on understanding min for the quantum spin system , and stimulate related investigations in this field .",
