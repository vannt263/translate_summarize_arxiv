    "<S> the b - factories have successfully exploited the unique advantages of the @xmath0(4s ) resonance to study many aspects of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0(10860 ) resonance , also known as @xmath0(5s ) , is above mass threshold for the @xmath3 and shares many of the same advantages . </S>",
    "<S> the belle experiment has collected more than 120 fb@xmath4 at the @xmath0(5s ) , corresponding to 7.9 million @xmath3 events . </S>",
    "<S> first results from these data are presented , including the first observation of a baryonic decay of @xmath3 , a novel measurement of @xmath5 , and observation of @xmath6(1p ) , @xmath6(2p ) , and two charged bottomonium - like states .     </S>",

    "<S> the belle experiment@xcite , located at kekb@xcite , although built primarily to measure @xmath12 asymmetries of @xmath13 meson decay in @xmath14 annihilations at the @xmath0(4s ) resonance , collected in 2005 - 9 a total of 121.4  fb@xmath4 at the @xmath0(5s ) resonance , corresponding to 37 million resonance events and including 7.9 million @xmath3 events . </S>",
    "<S> part of this sample , 23.6  fb@xmath4 , as well as an 8  fb@xmath4 nearby energy scan produced 11 publications covering several @xmath3 modes , @xmath13 events at the @xmath0(5s ) , and bottomonium transitions and spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> while rates of @xmath3 in @xmath14 collisions are low compared to those for hadronic collisions , @xmath15(5s))@xmath16  nb , the @xmath0(5s ) is nonetheless competitive for several aspects of @xmath3 decay ; the @xmath14 environment produces clean events , efficiently triggered , with precisely known center - of - mass energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the @xmath13-factory offers an existing facility with high luminosity , a well - studied detector with precise and sensitive photon detection , and an abundance of @xmath0(4s ) data for comparisons . </S>",
    "<S> the new preliminary results presented here , based on the full on - resonance set , include @xmath17 , a novel measurement of @xmath18 , and several new bottomonia .    the decay @xmath17 is reconstructed in the following sub - modes : @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( inclusion of complex conjugate modes is implied ) . </S>",
    "<S> the three types of @xmath3 events , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , are well identified and separated through `` full reconstruction '' of @xmath3 decays , where all decay products are measured , a method used with great success for non - strange @xmath13 s at the @xmath0(4s ) . </S>",

    "<S> this value is consistent with that for the correponding channel for @xmath30 , @xmath31@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath3 has been a primary focus of the @xmath0(5s ) program , the well - tuned methods of @xmath13 reconstruction from the @xmath0(4s ) have been applied to study the more complicated assortment of @xmath13 events at the @xmath0(5s)@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> three - body final states @xmath32 ( and charge conjugates ) are identified through full reconstruction of a neutral @xmath13 in a @xmath12-eigenstate and a charged pion . </S>",
    "<S> the event residue , consisting of a charged @xmath13 and up to two photons , is characterized through `` missing mass , '' calculated through energy and momentum conservation : @xmath33 the missing mass distributions are well separated for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 events , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : bbpi](left ) . the sign of the charged pion tags the initial flavor of the neutral @xmath13 and enables a _ time - independent _ measurement of @xmath12-asymmetry , which is related to @xmath5 as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the @xmath12-eigenvalue of the @xmath41 mode ) , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 in the standard model .    </S>",
