    "finally , the decaying modes in the curvature perturbation spectrum can not be accounted for by the @xmath0 formalism .",
    "more advanced computational techniques to overcome this latter problem have recently been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",

    "this is to say that hybrid inflation taking place at the gut scale comes with an ` initial ' horizon problem  @xcite . assuming that at pre - inflationary times the energy density of the universe decreases from some planckian value down to the gut scale in consequence of an ordinary radiation - dominated expansion",

[ fig_gravitinos ] illustrates the resulting relaxation of the constraints in the @xmath128 plane .",

    "of course , this also enlarges the allowed range for the reheating temperature .    in summary , while at first sight the gravitino problem seems to exclude a significant part of the parameter space in the case of gravitino lsp , cf .",
    "[ fig_gravitinos ] , there are several ways to avoid these constraints , e.g.  assuming @xmath343 with some assumptions on the supersymmetry breaking sector or particular mass hierarchies in the reheating process . however ,",
    "when embedding hybrid inflation into a more complete model of particle physics and the early universe , these options may not all be available and in particular , the reheating temperature may not be a free parameter .",
    "the above mentioned bounds and possible loopholes must then carefully be taken into account . in any case , the gravitino mass range suitable for rendering hybrid inflation in accordance with the planck data is interesting both from a particle physics as well as from a cosmological point of view , as it contains the mass range relevant for supersymmetric electroweak symmetry breaking and at the same time mass scales which can be restricted by early universe cosmology .",
    "supersymmetric hybrid inflation models typically feature a true vacuum in which supersymmetry is fully restored .",
    "a simple and straightforward way to accommodate soft low - energy supersymmetry breaking in this minkowski vacuum is to assume that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by non - vanishing f - terms in a hidden sector , whose dynamics are already completely fixed during inflation .",
    "this effectively results in a constant term in the superpotential proportional to the vacuum gravitino mass . since the mass scale of the gravitino",
    "is typically expected to be much smaller than the energy scale of inflation , the effect of this term on the inflationary dynamics has been widely neglected . however , since the inclusion of this term breaks the rotational invariance of the scalar potential in the complex inflaton plane , its effects can be very important even for small gravitino masses .",
    "f - term hybrid inflation is consequently a two - field model of inflation , such that its predictions for the observables related to the primordial fluctuations depend not only on the parameters of the scalar potential , but in particular also on the choice of the inflationary trajectory .",
    "this puts the measured values of the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum , the scalar spectral index and the amplitude of the local bispectrum into new light : their precise values are no longer dictated by the fundamental model parameters , but are rather strongly influenced by a selection process at very early times that appears to be random within the model itself . as these insights only rely on the presence of a large f - term driving inflation and the assumption of soft symmetry breaking in a hidden sector at very high scales ,",
    "similar conclusions should apply in comparable inflationary scenarios .",
    "we expect that our study and in particular our analysis of the linear term in the scalar potential can be easily generalized to other models of inflation , including large - field models , in which supersymmetry breaking turns an originally single - field model into a multi - field model .    in this paper",
    ", we analyzed the inflationary dynamics of f - term hybrid inflation in the complex plane based on the @xmath0 formalism .",
    "after extending the method presented in refs .",
    "@xcite so as to explicitly take into account the contributions to the curvature perturbation spectrum produced after the end of slow - roll inflation , we calculated the inflationary observables related to the scalar power spectrum and the local bispectrum as functions of the symmetry breaking scale @xmath16 , the superpotential coupling @xmath21 , the gravitino mass @xmath24 and the choice of the inflationary trajectory , labeled by the final inflaton phase @xmath46 .",
    "we found that the predictions for the scalar power spectrum are well described in an effective single - field approximation , whereas the bispectrum can obtain large contributions from the inherently multi - field dynamics . in ordinary single - field slow - roll inflation , we would expect the primordial non - gaussianities to be suppressed by the slow - roll parameters .",
    "by contrast , in hybrid inflation in the complex plane , we partly obtained @xmath145 values roughly as large as @xmath242 .",
    "we cross - checked the results of our numerical analysis by means of analytical calculations , which provided us with accurate analytical formulas for the hill - top regime on the real axis as well as with semi - analytical formulas for the two - field case .",
    "the results of our analysis demonstrate that f - term hybrid inflation is in much better shape than widely believed in two important points .",
    "first , the fine - tuning in the initial conditions necessary to obtain successful inflation is greatly reduced .",
    "second , the measured scalar spectral index can be reproduced in a significant part of the parameter space without resorting to a non - canonical khler potential .",
    "roughly speaking , a correct spectral index is obtained when the contributions to the slope of the scalar potential from one - loop corrections and from supersymmetry breaking have opposite sign , but are of comparable size .",
    "this is typically accomplished along trajectories in the complex plane corresponding to @xmath344 , i.e.trajectories which pass through the vicinity of the hill - top region on the real axis .",
    "taking into account the effect of supersymmetry breaking hence links the cmb observables to the mass scale of soft supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the resulting mass range for the gravitino mass turns out to lie in a region which is very interesting , including the mass range relevant for supersymmetric electroweak symmetry breaking , for gravitino lsp dark matter as well as for nonthermal dark matter production through the decay of heavy gravitinos . a crucial further development which will have an important impact on f - term hybrid inflation",
    "is the ongoing search for primordial b - mode polarization of the cmb radiation .",

    "<S> supersymmetric hybrid inflation is an exquisite framework to connect inflationary cosmology to particle physics at the scale of grand unification . ending in a phase transition associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking </S>",
    "<S> , it can naturally explain the generation of entropy , matter and dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> coupling f - term hybrid inflation to soft supersymmetry breaking distorts the rotational invariance in the complex inflaton plane  an important fact , which has been neglected in all previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> based on the @xmath0 formalism , we analyze the cosmological perturbations for the first time in the full two - field model , also taking into account the fast - roll dynamics at and after the end of inflation . as a consequence of the two - field nature of hybrid inflation , the predictions for the primordial fluctuations depend not only on the parameters of the lagrangian , but are eventually fixed by the choice of the inflationary trajectory . recognizing hybrid inflation as a two - field model resolves two shortcomings often times attributed to it : the fine - tuning problem of the initial conditions is greatly relaxed and a spectral index in accordance with the planck data can be achieved in a large part of the parameter space without the aid of supergravity corrections . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis can be easily generalized to other ( including large - field ) scenarios of inflation in which soft supersymmetry breaking transforms an initially single - field model into a multi - field model .    </S>",
