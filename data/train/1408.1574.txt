    "a planar sheet can propel itself through a polar liquid or a ferrofluid by the generation of an oscillating electric or magnetic polarization in the fluid @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is based on the nonlinear coupling of polarization and field , which leads to a torque density acting on the fluid , causing it to move .",
    "the same coupling allows pumping of a neutral electrically polar liquid like water by the application of a running electric wave @xcite , and pumping of a ferrofluid by the application of a running magnetic wave @xcite,@xcite . in the following",
    "we study electric or magnetic self - propulsion of a spherical microbot .",
    "the planar sheet provides a simple model allowing straightforward mathematical analysis , but a sphere resembles more closely a compact object which would be used experimentally and needs to be analyzed separately .    for definiteness",
    "we discuss only the electrical case in detail , but a quite analogous derivation holds in the magnetic case . in the electrical case",
    "we assume that the motion is caused by an oscillating charge density located inside a rigid spherical surface , generating an electrical field which polarizes the surrounding fluid . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the electrical field can be decomposed into dipole and quadrupole contributions .",
    "the sphere is caused to move by interference of the dipole and quadrupole fields which leads to a time - independent electrical azimuthal torque density acting on the fluid .",
    "the torque density creates a steady vortex ring surrounding the sphere and propelling it . in fig .",
    "1 we draw a schematic picture of the effect .    in analogy to the theory of ferrohydrodynamic pumping @xcite we calculate the propulsion velocity of the sphere in perturbation theory to second order in powers of the amplitude of the exciting charge density . the perturbation calculation has the advantage of simplicity .",
    "it leads to an explicit expression for the propulsion velocity , and hence allows insight into its dependence on the system parameters . to the order considered",
    ", the nonlinear convective terms in the equations of motion can be neglected .",
    "we have shown in the case of ferrohydrodynamic pumping @xcite and self - propulsion of a planar microbot @xcite that the theory can be extended to higher order , but the second order perturbation theory turned out to be quite sufficient from a numerical point of view .",
    "therefore we limit the calculation to second order perturbation theory in the present case . at the surface of the sphere",
    "the flow velocity is required to satisfy a no - slip boundary condition , but a mixed slip - stick boundary condition could also be considered .    the spherical geometry is preferable to the planar one in experimental realization and in numerical simulation",
    ". it would be fascinating to construct a microbot without moving parts of the type considered here .",
    "if realized , it may offer interesting technical application , for example in the transport of drugs through a fluid .",
