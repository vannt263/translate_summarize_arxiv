    "since the discovery of the @xmath15 and @xmath1 mesons in the seventies by the mark i collaboration  @xcite , the interest in the charmed meson spectroscopy has grown exponentially and the newly developed experimental facilities like cleo , belle , babar , etc . , are continuously bringing more relevant information about the excited charmed meson states  @xcite .",
    "this information is very useful to elucidate the way the strong interaction works when a heavy quark is involved . in this aspect",

    "however , in spite of all the experimental and theoretical works , a rather scarce information is available on the properties of the charmed meson resonances like spin , isospin , parity , etc .",
    "the most clear evidence of this fact is the summary of the knowledge on these particles given by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , which lists only six @xmath15 and five @xmath1 meson excited states ( cataloging separately the neutral and the charged ones ) spread over the energy region of 2400 - 2750 mev . out of them ,",
    "five @xmath15 and two @xmath1 states are omitted from the summary table due to controversy on their properties .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the energy region studied experimentally covers a range of only 350 mev from the first to the last excited state , while the interaction of a @xmath15 or a @xmath1 meson , due to their heavy mass ( around 2000 mev ) , with a vector or few pseudoscalar mesons could give rise to a resonance with a mass close to 3000 mev .",
    "recently , a theoretical work along this line was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a system formed of a @xmath15 meson and the @xmath16 resonance was investigated using two different techniques : one based on effective field theories and other based on qcd sum rules , and the agreement of both methods was remarkably good . as a result , a new @xmath15 meson state with mass around 2900 mev was predicted .",
    "similarly , with another recent study of the @xmath0 system in s - wave using effective field theories based on hidden local symmetry  @xcite an effort has been made to shed some more light on the nature of two of the @xmath1 resonances listed by the pdg : @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the spin - parity of the former state was confirmed to be @xmath17 , and the spin and parity of the latter one was predicted to be @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , a new state with mass close to 2600 mev and spin 0 , thus @xmath19 , was predicted .    in this manuscript , with the objective of understanding the properties and nature of the resonances @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we investigate the @xmath0 system using qcd sum rules to determine the mass of its possible resonances and compare our results with the ones found in ref .",
    "we would like to investigate the generation of @xmath0 molecular states using a formalism based on qcd sum rules , but before we enter into details about how to do this , let us first summarize the main aspects of the previous study of the @xmath0 system made by the authors of ref .",
