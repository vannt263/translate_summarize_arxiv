    "larson & tinsley ( 1978 ) first recognized the close connection between galaxy - galaxy interactions and star formation .",
    "they suggested that this relationship is a fundamental ingredient of galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "2004 ; lin et al . 2004",
    "; papovich et al . 2005 ; bell et al . 2006 ) .    the connection between interacting pairs of galaxies and star formation is now well established observationally and there is a promising correspondence between the predictions of simulations and the properties of well - defined samples of close pairs .",
    "the data are consistent with a burst of star formation triggered by a close galaxy - galaxy interaction ; the burst continues and ages as the galaxies move apart ( mihos et al .",
    "1991 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; bgk , bgk2 , lambas et al . 2003 ; nikolic et al .",
    "the primary feature of the data is an anti - correlation between the projected separation of a pair on the sky and measures of the normalized star formation rate .",
    "this anti - correlation suggests a dependence of the burst strength and probably burst age on the separation of the galaxy pair ( bgk2 ) .",
    "here we focus on near infrared observations of close pairs of galaxies in the full bgk sample with attention to the distinctive features of infrared emission possibly associated with the interaction .",
    "the literature contains detailed near infrared observations of famous individual interacting galaxy pairs ( e.g. lopez - sanchez et al .",
    "2004 ) and a few optical - infrared imaging surveys of small objectively selected samples of close pairs .",
    "bushouse & werner ( 1990 ) imaged a sample of 22 interacting galaxies . in their sample ,",
    "the nuclei are redder than the outer regions by @xmath4 and 0.9 mag in j - k and r - k , respectively .",
    "they attribute the color gradient mostly to an increase in the amount of dust in the nuclear regions and argue that the infrared colors are unaffected by dust emission .",
    "cutri and mcalary ( 1985 ) carried out small aperture photometry of a larger sample of pairs .",
    "they concluded that a larger fraction of interacting than non - interacting galaxies have j - k and h - k colors outside the normal range .",
    "giuricin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) used a compendium of data from the literature to investigate the effect of interactions on the near infrared properties of spiral galaxies .",
    "in contrast with bushouse and werner ( 1990 ) , they concluded that apparently interacting galaxies have h - k and k - l excesses indicative of thermal emission from hot dust probably related to star formation induced by the interaction .",
    "we use our spectroscopy and matched small aperture photometry along with 2mass photometry to revisit these issues in a much larger dataset of nearly 800 galaxies in close pairs and n - tuples .    in the far infrared",
    ", iras observations still yield the largest datasets for consideration of the properties of galaxy - galaxy interactions as a function of observable descriptors of the pair ( see , for example , goto 2005 ) .",
    "telesco , wolstencroft & done ( 1988 ) compiled iras observations of pairs selected from the catalog of arp & madore ( 1987 ) and resolved by iras . in their set of 93 pairs of comparable luminosity , they find that pairs with the highest far infrared color temperature have the smallest projected separation on the sky .",
    "they concluded that interactions measurably enhance the intensity or efficiency of star formation .",
    "bushouse et al .",
    "( 1988 ) reached similar conclusions based on iras observations of a sample of pairs selected on the basis of optical morphology .",
    "recently surace , sanders & mazzarella ( 2004 ; ssm hereafter ) used hires image reconstruction to resolve the iras emission at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath5 m for 106 interacting galaxy systems where the galaxies are separated by less than three average galaxy diameters .",
    "the sample has a flux limit at 60 @xmath5 m of 5.24 jy .",
    "we use their sample to provide a context for discussion of the generally unresolved iras detections in our sample . neither the ssm or bgk samples contain any ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "the complexity of the underlying sources of emission in the near infrared has probably been a disincentive to investigating pairs in this spectral range . with current data",
    "it remains difficult to disentangle the effects of reddening and thermal dust emission at several temperatures .",
    "photometry at l together with spatially resolved photometry of large samples at longer wavelengths are necessary for clearer understanding of these issues .",
    "currently available data are , however , adequate to demonstrate the promise of the infrared for probing the galaxy - galaxy merger process and the links between galaxy - galaxy interactions and star formation .    here",
    "we compile the largest sample to date of near infrared colors of galaxy pairs .",
    "the data we consider include 2mass jhk@xmath6 photometry for 791 galaxies in the bgk sample and our own deeper jhk small aperture photometry for a subsample of 160 bgk galaxies .",
    "we also use iras detections and upper limits for the entire bgk sample as a marker of the relationship between galaxy - galaxy interactions , star formation , and thermal emission from hot dust in these systems .",
    "we use our optical spectra and infrared colors measured through the same aperture to investigate basic properties of the central regions of these galaxies .",
    "2 is a description of the infrared photometry and a review of the optical photometry and spectroscopy .",
    "the data include resolved 2mass photometry for 44 systems unresolved in the public catalogs and for 24 galaxies not detected or confused with nearby stars or galaxies . in section 3 we investigate the infrared properties of the sample .",
    "we discuss the near infrared color - color diagram and investigate the relationships among the near and far infrared colors , the balmer decrement , and the normalized star formation rate . in section 4",
    "we show that the star formation rate as indicated by the normalized far infrared flux increases as the projected pair separation decreases as expected if the interaction triggers star formation .",
    "there is also a suggestive increase in the spread of near infrared color as the projected separation of the pair decreases .",
    "this increased spread is evidence for triggered central bursts which may be either very blue or very heavily obscured and reddened .",

    "using a pipeline developed by w. wyatt , we calibrated each frame with standard routines in noao iraf .",
    "to generate flat - fields for each night , we median - filter all program frames using imcom , remove hot and dead pixels with a bad pixel mask , and normalize the median of the flat - field to unity . after dividing linearized program frames by the flat - field , we sort images by their median sky levels and select 1115 images with sky levels closest to the median sky level of each program field .",
    "median - filtered images of each set of 1115 images , scaled by their median levels , yield sky frames for each program field .",
    "sky - subtracted images with bad pixels removed have a median background level of zero and noise levels of 20.021.0 mag arcsec@xmath23 at h.    the technique to derive sky frames has several advantages over traditional methods . in ideal conditions where the sky background varies slowly and monotonically through the night , our approach yields sky frames composed of images acquired close in time to the program frame , as in standard reduction packages .",
    "when the sky background fluctuates erratically , our sky frames have fewer low level background features than traditional sky frames and do not require a dc offset to match background levels .",

    "repeat measurements acquired on different observing runs indicate a similar uncertainty . the median offset between different observing runs",

    "we thus conclude that the typical photometric uncertainty in our slit magnitudes is @xmath0 0.04 mag .",
    "to estimate the uncertainty in the colors from our slit magnitudes , we derive colors assuming a fixed slit position for all three bands .",

    "however , we determine the color at a fixed slit position for all three bands .",
    "thus the error in the slit position should not be included in the error in color .",
    "we therefore reduce the error in the color by removing the uncertainty in slit position relative to the spectroscopic aperture , @xmath38 @xmath27 0.03 mag , and by the median offset in the photometric calibration between observing runs , @xmath0 0.02 mag , which yields an expected error , @xmath27 0.04 mag , that agrees with the measured uncertainty .",

    "[ fig : ircolorsep ] suggests that the range of colors may be greater for tighter pairs , but the strength of the conclusion may be limited by the sample size .",
    "the 2mass data also yield insignificant differences in color distribution with projected separation , but the 2mass aperture is large and the 2mass k@xmath6 is less sensitive to the effects of dust .",

    "the sample of close pairs we analyze is much larger than those considered in previous investigations of the infrared properties of close pairs .",
    "we use a combination of 2mass photometry , deep jhk photometry in small apertures , spectroscopy , and iras data to explore the infrared as a probe of triggered bursts of star formation .",
    "we find :    1 .",
    "the distribution of j - h , h - k@xmath6 , and h - k colors of pairs is broader than the corresponding distribution for a sample of `` normal '' galaxies .",
    "we interpret this difference as evidence for bursts of star formation which produce an extension toward bluer colors and for a combination of reddened and/or dusty bursts which produce an extension toward redder colors , particularly in h - k . in the color - color diagram",
    "the reddest objects in h - k are also red in j - h .",
    "the colors of these objects follow a track for thermal emission from 600 - 1000k dust .",
    "the reddest h - k colors require emission from hot dust .",
    "2 .   a statistical model including emission from a young stellar population , gaseous emission from hii regions , and emission from hot dust explains the outliers in infrared color - color diagrams .",
    "this model shows that triggered central bursts affect the near infrared colors .",
    "the effects are complex because of the multiplicity of emission processes important in the near infrared .",
    "we use our spectroscopy and small aperture photometry to show that the central j - h colors and balmer decrements are consistent with the galactic reddening law .",
    "however h - k colors are essentially uncorrelated with the balmer decrement as a result of emission from hot dust .",
    "we identify a set of objects with central h - k @xmath1 0.45 , with f@xmath2/f@xmath91 , and with small ew(h@xmath50 ) .",
    "we argue that these objects harbor compact dust enshrouded bursts possibly similar to the super - star clusters identified in well - studied interacting galaxies .",
    "these objects may be examples of `` hidden '' bursts or , possibly , `` hidden '' agn .",
    "their presence supports the contention that h@xmath50 surveys underestimate the volume averaged star formation rate in the nearby universe .",
    "we examine measures of the specific star formation rate as a function of the projected separation of the pairs in our sample . both spectroscopic and far infrared photometric measures",
    "show that the specific star formation rate decreases with increasing projected separation .",
    "the poor spatial resolution of iras prevents direct comparison of these measures .",
    "examination of the near infrared color - color diagram as a function of projected separation shows that all of the outliers indicative of a central burst of star formation lie in pairs at small separation .",
    "although our sample is too small to make the case for a statistically significant dependence of the near infrared color - color diagram on projected separation , the data suggest that larger samples of deep , small aperture near infrared photometry would be a basis for identifying both the very blue and very red central bursts .",
    "an increase in the dispersion might be expected as a result of triggered bursts which produce blue central regions in the absence of dust and very red central regions in the presence of dust .",
    "taken together these results indicate that a larger sample of pairs with complete spectroscopy and with small aperture near infrared photometry and resolved mid - infrared photometry from _ spitzer",
    "_ would be an important dataset for isolating the effects of young bursts , reddening , and thermal dust emission over the course of galaxy - galaxy interactions and subsequent mergers .",
