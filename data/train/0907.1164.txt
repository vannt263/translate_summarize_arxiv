    "the study of cosmic ray ( cr ) antiprotons may present an opportunity to investigate the baryonic asymmetry of the universe and to uncover evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter .",
    "antiprotons are anyway produced by standard nuclear interactions of cr nuclei over the interstellar medium ( spallation processes ) .",
    "therefore , the observation of @xmath1 abundance in the cr flux is a key to understanding cr propagation and provide information complementary to that provided by secondary nuclei as li , be and b or secondaries of iron . unlike secondary nuclei ,",
    "antiprotons are tracers primarily of the propagation history of the proton , the dominant cr component @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of the antiproton flux up to about 100 gev @xcite are consistent with the conventional cr model , in which antiprotons are secondary particles yielded by the spallation of cr nuclei over the interstellar medium .",
    "nevertheless , exotic models of primary @xmath1 production not ruled out by low energy measurements yet are available .",
    "antiprotons can be produced from primordial black hole evaporation or in anti - galaxies . in some scenarios models of primary antiprotons production",
    "can provide a @xmath2 ratio increasing up to the 10% level in the few - tev energy range ( see the review paper by stephen and golden @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , cosmic ray antiprotons , as well as positrons , are considered as prime targets for indirect detection of galactic dark matter ( see for example @xcite and reference therein ) . as an example , some recent analyses suggest that the overall pamela @xcite @xmath1 and @xmath3 data and atic / ppb - bets @xcite @xmath4 data can be reproduced taking into account a heavy dm particle ( m @xmath510 tev ) that annihilates into @xmath6 or @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this scenario implies that the @xmath2 ratio , consistent with the background of secondary production up to about 50 gev , increases rapidly reaching the 10@xmath8 level in the tev energy region .",
    "linsley @xcite and lloyd - evans @xcite in 1985 independently explored the possibility to use the moon or sun shadows as mass spectrometer in order to measure the charge composition of cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "in particular linsley first discussed the idea to measure the cosmic ray antiprotons abundance exploiting the separation of the proton and antiproton shadows .",
    "the geomagnetic field should deflect the antimatter component of the cosmic rays in the opposite direction with respect to the matter one .",
    "therefore , if protons are deflected by the geomagnetic field towards east , antiprotons are deflected towards west .",
    "if the energy and the angular resolution are respectively low and small enough , we can distinguish , in principle , between two shadows , one shifted towards west due to the protons and the other shifted towards east due to the antiprotons one . at high energy",
    "( @xmath5 10 tev ) the magnetic deflection is too small compared to the angular resolution and the shadows can not be disentangled . at low energy ( @xmath9100 gev )",
    "the well separated shadows are washed out by the poor angular resolution , thus limiting the sensitivity .",
    "therefore , there is an optimal energy window for the measurement of the antiproton abundance .    in this paper",
    "we report on the measurement of the @xmath2 ratio in the few - tev energy region exploiting the observation of the galactic cosmic ray moon shadowing effect performed by the argo - ybj experiment .",
    "the argo - ybj detector , located at the yangbajing cosmic ray laboratory ( tibet , p.r .",
    "china , 4300 m a.s.l . ) , is the only experiment exploiting the _ full coverage _ approach at very high altitude .",
    "the detector is constituted by a central carpet @xmath1074@xmath1178 m@xmath12 , made of a single layer of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) with @xmath1092@xmath13 of active area , enclosed by a partially instrumented guard ring that extends the detector surface up to @xmath10100@xmath11110 m@xmath12 .",
    "the apparatus has a modular structure , the basic data acquisition element being a cluster ( 5.72@xmath117.64 m@xmath12 ) , namely a group of 12 rpcs ( 2.80@xmath111.25 m@xmath12 each ) .",
    "each chamber is read by 80 strips of 7@xmath1162 cm@xmath12 ( the spatial pixel ) , logically organized in 10 independent pads of 56@xmath1162 cm@xmath12 representing the time pixel of the detector .",
    "the rpcs are operated in streamer mode with a standard gas mixture ( argon 15% , isobutane 10% , tetrafluoroethane 75% ) , the high voltage settled at 7.2 kv ensures an overall efficiency of about 96% @xcite .",
    "the central carpet contains 130 clusters ( hereafter argo-130 ) and the full detector is composed of 153 clusters for a total active surface of @xmath106700 m@xmath12 .",
    "all events giving a number of fired pads n@xmath15 n@xmath16 in the central carpet within a time window of 420 ns are recorded .",
    "the spatial coordinates and the time of any fired pad are then used to reconstruct the position of the shower core and the arrival direction of the primary .",
    "the argo - ybj experiment started recording data with the whole central carpet in june 2006 .",
    "the period until autumn 2007 has been mainly devoted to installation and debugging operations , the duty cycle being lower in that period . since 2007",
    "november the full detector is in stable data taking at the multiplicity trigger threshold n@xmath1720 and a duty cycle @xmath18 : the trigger rate is about 3.6 khz .",
    "the reconstruction of shower parameters is split into the following steps .",
    "first the shower core position is derived with the maximum likelihood method from the lateral density distribution of the secondary particles . in the second step ,",
    "given the shower core position , the shower axis is reconstructed by means of an iterative un - weighted planar fit being able to reject the time values belonging to the non - gaussian tails of the arrival time distributions . a conical correction with a slope fixed to @xmath19 = 0.03 rad is applied to the surviving hits in order to improve the angular resolution @xcite .",
    "the air showers development in the atmosphere has been generated with the corsika v. 6.500 code including the qgsjet - ii.03 hadronic interaction model for primary energy above 80 gev and the fluka code for lower energies @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray spectra of p , he and cno have been simulated in the energy range from 30 gev to 1 pev following @xcite . the relative fractions ( in % of the total ) after triggering by the argo - ybj detector for events with n@xmath2030 are : p@xmath1088% , he@xmath1010% , cno@xmath102% .",

    "simulated events have been generated in the same format used for the experimental data and they have been analyzed by using the same reconstruction code .",
    "a detailed monte carlo simulation of cosmic rays propagation in the earth - moon system has been developed to compare the observed displacement of the shadow with the expectations , so disentangling the effect of the geomagnetic field from a possible systematic pointing error .",
    "the algorithm is described in @xcite .",
    "for the analysis of the shadowing effect a 10@xmath25 10@xmath26 sky map in celestial coordinates ( right ascension and declination ) with 0.1@xmath250.1@xmath26 bin size , centered on the moon location , is filled with the detected events .",

    "the analysis refers to about 6@xmath2110@xmath27 events collected only during the stable operation period of data taking after the following event selection : ( 1 ) each event should fire more than 30 strips on the argo-130 central carpet to avoid any threshold effect ; ( 2 ) the zenith angle of the event arrival direction should be less than 50@xmath26 ; ( 3 ) the reconstructed core position should be inside an area 250@xmath11250 m@xmath12 around the detector ; ( 4 ) the reduced @xmath28 of the final temporal fit should be less than 100 ns@xmath12 .",
