    "as a stellar population ages , the main - sequence turnoff becomes cooler and fainter , until , after an age of about 2 gyrs , the ultraviolet ( @xmath4 1500   ) flux is no longer dominated by stars near the main - sequence , but instead must be due to a more exotic population of hot stars , such as blue stragglers , hot subdwarf ( sdb , sdo ) stars , hot post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) stars , white dwarfs , or interacting binaries .",
    "the blue stragglers and hot subdwarfs are of particular interest since they might have significant roles , respectively , in two current problems in extragalactic astronomy : the age - dating of old galaxies from their rest - frame near - uv ( @xmath5   ) spectra , and understanding the origin of the observed uv - upturn in elliptical galaxies . in the absence of blue stragglers , the rest - frame near - uv spectrum of an old galaxy",
    "should be dominated by the turnoff population , and thus fitting the spectrum to population synthesis models should be a reliable method for age - dating the galaxy , although metallicity effects also need to be properly disentangled ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as noted by spinrad et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , a significant underestimate of the galaxy age could result if blue stragglers contribute a large fraction of the galaxy near - uv flux , but are not included in the adopted population synthesis model .",
    "greggio & renzini ( 1990 ) outlined the various candidates for the origin of the observed uv - upturn in elliptical galaxies , which is characterized by a rising uv flux shortward of 1800    ( @xcite , @xcite ) . among these candidates , white dwarfs and hot post - agb stars",
    "have the advantage of being relatively well - understood phases of stellar evolution , but lack sufficient fuel to explain the strongest uv - upturn galaxies .",
    "the more promising candidates are currently the extreme horizontal - branch ( ehb ) stars and their hot progeny ; the agb - manqu stars , which miss the agb phase entirely , and the post - early agb stars , which leave the agb before the thermally pulsing phase . although the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology of the globular clusters becomes generally redder with increasing metallicity , a significant ehb population is theoretically expected at metallicities above solar ( and an age larger than about 5 gyr ) , if reasonable assumptions are made concerning the metallicity dependence of the mass loss rate and helium abundance ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "spectroscopically , ehb and agb - manqu stars are expected to appear , respectively , as sdb and sdo stars , and the measured effective temperatures and gravities of the field hot subdwarf stars is consistent with this scenario ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the field hot subdwarfs apparently have a large binary fraction ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which instead suggests that binary interactions might be involved in their formation ( @xcite ) .    despite their probable contributions to the ultraviolet spectra of galaxies , blue stragglers and hot subdwarfs are either neglected or poorly constrained in existing population synthesis models of old stellar populations .",
    "the currently favored explanations for the origin of blue stragglers involve binary interactions , either through mass - transfer processes , binary mergers , or direct stellar collisions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but the large parameter space of these binary processes limits their inclusion in synthesis models to special cases ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "some attempts have been made to include ehb stars in synthesis models of metal - rich populations , but these are hampered by large uncertainties , for example , in the dependence of mass loss and helium abundance on metallicity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the modeling of galaxy ultraviolet spectra should clearly benefit from empirical studies of the ultraviolet content of resolved , old , metal - rich stellar populations .    here",
    "we report on ultraviolet ( @xmath4 1600   ) images of the three old ( @xmath6 gyr ) open clusters m67 , ngc 188 , and ngc 6791 , which were obtained in march 1995 using the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( uit , @xcite ) during the second flight of the _ astro _ observatory .",
    "the @xmath7 diameter field of view of uit is sufficiently large to allow a complete census of the hot stellar population in the observed clusters .",
    "thus , the uit images of these three clusters can be used for an empirical study of the ultraviolet content of old , metal - rich stellar populations .",
    "as it turns out , m67 contains blue stragglers , but no hot subdwarfs , whereas ngc 188 and ngc 6791 contain hot subdwarfs , but are too old , distant and reddened for the blue stragglers to be detectable with uit .",
    "m67 is also sufficiently nearby that all the white dwarfs hotter than @xmath4 21,000 k should have been detected on the uit image . in the population synthesis models of magris & bruzual ( 1993 ) , white dwarfs supply about 10% of the 1750    flux in elliptical galaxies with a weak uv - upturn , and in section 3.2 we re - examine the white dwarf contribution to galaxy ultraviolet spectra , using more recent stellar atmospheres and evolutionary models .",
    "a brief summary of this work was given by landsman & stecher ( 1997 ) .",
    "a subsequent paper will discuss the uit observations of the intermediate age ( @xmath4 2 gyr ) clusters ngc 752 and ngc 7789 , which are sufficiently young to allow the turnoff population to be detected in the ultraviolet .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] gives the adopted fundamental parameters of the observed clusters , and table [ tbl-2 ] lists the deepest exposure obtained with each uit filter , along with the coordinates of the uit image center .",
    "the uit image center was chosen to provide a target for the co - pointed spectroscopic instruments on the _ astro _ observatory , and could be offset by as much as @xmath8 ( in the case of ngc 6791 ) from the cluster center .",
    "m67 was observed with the b1 filter , which has a peak wavelength of 1520    and a bandwith of 350    ( see figure [ fig-3 ] ) .",
    "ngc 6791 was observed with the b5 filter , which has a peak wavelength of 1620    and a bandwidth of 230   .",
    "ngc 188 was observed with both the b1 and the b5 filter .",
    "( the less sensitive b5 filter was used on the daytime side of the shuttle orbit , because it suppresses 1300    dayglow emission . ) ultraviolet magnitudes on the b1 and b5 images are denoted here as m@xmath9  and m@xmath10 , respectively , and are given on the monochromatic system , where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the observed flux in units of erg @xmath13 s@xmath14 @xmath14 .",
    "only a few stars in each cluster are detected on the uit images , so that ultraviolet magnitudes could be derived from simple circular aperture photometry .",
    "however , the absolute calibration of the uit images is somewhat problematic .",
    "as discussed by stecher et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , comparison of fluxes from uit and the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) indicated that the sensitivity of the uit during the _ astro-2 _ mission appeared to decrease with exposure time .",
    "the cause of this behaviour has not been determined , and instead an empirical correction to the exposure time was adopted that , for most images , brought the iue and uit fluxes to within 15% of each other . for m67 , this mean",
    "calibration could be tested , and an aperture correction determined , by direct comparison with spectra from iue and the _ goddard high - resolution spectrograph _ ( ghrs ) of five stars in the cluster .",
    "the ngc 6791 calibration was modified by comparison with a single star ( ngc 6791-b4 ) with a ghrs observation , while for ngc 188 we had to rely on the mean uit calibration .",
    "thus while the photometry of all the clusters has a random uncertainty of about 0.1 mag , we estimate an uncertainty in the absolute photometry of about 0.1 mag for m67 , and about 0.15 mag for ngc 6791 and ngc 188 .",
    "all iue spectra in this paper used the newsips ( @xcite ) reduction , with the fluxes multipled by 1.06 , as suggested by colina & bohlin ( 1994 ) .",
    "m67 is a well - studied , nearby ( 820 pc ) , solar - metallicity open cluster with an age of about four gyr .",
    "twenty stars are detected on the uit image of m67 ( figure [ fig-1 ] ) , including eleven blue stragglers , seven white dwarf candidates , the yellow - giant s1040 ( from the catalog of @xcite ) , and the probable non - member s1466 .",
    "the integrated 1520    flux of m67 is completely dominated by the blue stragglers , and in particular , by the bright , hot ( v = 10.03 , = 0.09 ) blue straggler f81 .",
    "figure [ fig-2 ] shows a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of a @xmath15 field centered on m67 taken from montgomery et al.(1993 , hereafter mmj93 ) , with circles identifying the sources detected in the ultraviolet .",
    "in general , the stars that are detected in the ultraviolet are ones with the bluest colors , with the notable exception of the star s1040 , which has v = 11.52 and = 0.82 .",
    "s1040 is a known spectroscopic binary and landsman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) used ghrs spectroscopy of s1040 to show that the ultraviolet flux is due to a hot white dwarf companion of the yellow giant .",
    "landsman et al .",
    "also constructed a mass - transfer history for s1040 that explains its unusual `` red straggler '' location in the cmd ( 0.2 mag blueward of the giant branch ) , relatively long orbital period ( 42d ) , and the unusually low mass ( @xmath16 m@xmath2 ) of the white dwarf companion . in their scenario , s1040 originated as a short - period ( @xmath4 2d ) binary , in which the more massive star ( the donor ) fills its roche lobe while on the lower giant branch .",
    "a period of rapid mass transfer reverses the mass - ratio of the donor and accretor ( but without creating a common envelope ) , and is followed by an extended period ( @xmath4 800 myr ) of stable mass transfer . during the mass transfer , the orbital period increases , and the accretor eventually becomes a blue straggler , more massive than the cluster turn - off stars .",
    "mass transfer ends when the donor s envelope is depleted , leaving a low mass helium white dwarf , and a blue straggler , which has since evolved redward to its current location in the cmd .",
    "eleven of the thirteen blue stragglers in m67 listed by milone & latham ( 1994 ) are detected on the uit image .",
    "the first two columns of table [ tbl-3 ] contain , respectively , the fagerholm and the sanders ( 1977 ) identifications of the detected blue stragglers , the third and fourth columns list the v and  magnitudes tabulated by mmj93 , and the fifth column gives the observed uit magnitude , m@xmath9 .",
    "the brightest and hottest blue straggler is f81 ( v = 10.03 , = 0.07 ) , which is saturated even on the shortest exposure ( 109s ) uit image .",
    "optical and iue spectra of f81 were studied by schnberner & napiwotzki ( 1994 ) , who derived t@xmath17  = 12,750 k , @xmath18  = 4.26 and a spectroscopic mass of @xmath19 m@xmath2 . comparing the iue spectra of f81 with the uit photometry of the remaining stars in m67",
    ", we find that f81 supplies more than 90% of the total 1520    flux of m67 . despite the extreme properties of f81 ,",
    "the evidence is strong from both astrometric ( @xcite ) and radial velocity ( @xcite ) studies that it is a cluster member .    in order to search for evidence of a subluminous hot companion , or an unusual ultraviolet spectrum",
    ", we compare the uit photometry of the blue stragglers with model atmosphere predictions , using stellar parameters derived from optical photometry .",
    "temperatures and gravities for most of the blue stragglers are calculated from the strmgren photometry tabulated by hauck & mermilliod ( 1998 ) , using the code of napiwotzki et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and assuming e(b  y ) = 0.73e ( ) = 0.018 for all stars .",
    "no strmgren photometry is available for f90 , and so the values of t@xmath17  and @xmath18  for this star are taken from mathys ( 1991 ) , who derived them using geneva photometry .",
    "the predicted m@xmath9   magnitude is then calculated from the derived t@xmath17  and @xmath18  using the 1995 kurucz lte model atmospheres as tabulated by lejeune et al .",
    "this version of the kurucz models includes the modification of the convective overshoot algorithm discussed by castelli ( 1996 ) , which eliminates the discontinuities in color indicies for 6500  k",
    "@xmath20 t@xmath17@xmath20 8000  k that was present in earlier versions of the kurucz grid .",
    "the models are normalized to the stellar v magnitude , and reddened using the parameterization of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) with r@xmath21 = 3.1 .",
    "the calculated values of t@xmath17  and @xmath18  are listed in columns 5 and 6 of table [ tbl-3 ] , and the predicted m@xmath9  magnitudes are given in column 7 .",
    "for the range of effective temperatures considered here ( 6500  8500 k ) , the uit 1520    bandpass is located shortward of the blackbody peak , and thus is very sensitive both to the exact value of t@xmath17 and to the accuracy of the model atmosphere .",
    "an uncertainty of 200 k in the value of t@xmath17  corresponds to about a 0.5 mag uncertainty in the predicted uit magnitude .",
    "archival iue spectra are available for the blue stragglers f280 , f156 , f153 , and f190 , and these provide a much more robust comparison with the model atmospheres .",
    "figure [ fig-3 ] compares the iue spectra with kurucz models with [ fe / h ] = 0.1 , and t@xmath17  and @xmath18  from table [ tbl-3 ] , normalized to the stellar v magnitude .",
    "no parameters were adjusted to improve the fit .",
    "the model spectra provide a good fit to both f280 and f156 , and the model fits for f153 and f190 can be improved by adopting values of t@xmath17  that are lower by 60 k and 140 k , respectively , than the values listed in table [ tbl-3 ] ; a change that is within the uncertainty of the strmgren photometry .",
    "in addition , the somewhat poorer fit for f153 may be related to its am star abundance peculiarities ( @xcite ) , while the poorer fit for f190 may be related to its 0.02 mag @xmath22 sct pulsations ( @xcite ) , since the flux variations of @xmath22 sct stars are known to be much larger in the ultraviolet ( @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the iue spectra provide no evidence for a subluminous companion in any of the four stars .",
    "the lack of a hot subluminous companion for f190 is especially noteworthy , because it is a single - lined spectroscopic binary with a 4.2d period , and suspected to be currently undergoing mass transfer ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that if we let the reddening be a free parameter in the model atmosphere fits , then lower reddening values ( 0.015 @xmath20 e ( ) @xmath20 0.025 ) are consistently favored over the higher values in the range usually considered acceptable for m67 ( 0.015 @xmath20 e ( ) @xmath20 0.052 ; @xcite ) .    for the remaining blue stragglers , taking into account the @xmath23 mag uncertainty in the predicted uit flux , and the 0.14 mag uncertainty in the measured uit flux ,",
    "there is strong evidence for a uv excess only for the two stars f131 ( s1082 ) and f90 ( s975 ) . in the case of f131 ,",
    "the observed 1520  flux is a factor of six higher than predicted from the optically derived t@xmath17 .",
    "mathys ( 1991 ) found evidence for an additional broad component in the  d and  absorption lines of f131 , which he suggested was due to a hot , fast - rotating secondary . f131",
    "is also a rosat source with an x - ray luminosity of @xmath24 erg s@xmath14 ( @xcite ) . the x - ray emission and the presence of a hot",
    ", subluminous secondary together suggest that f131 is an algol - type mass - transfer binary .",
    "milone ( 1991 ) reports that f131 is a radial velocity variable , with a small amplitude and a long period , but no orbit has yet been determined .",
    "the uit magnitude of f90 is probably uncertain by close to a factor of two , because f90 is located in the wings of the heavily saturated image of f81 . nevertheless , the detection of f90 with uit is quite robust , and likely due to a hot subluminous companion , since the predicted ultraviolet magnitude from the optically - derived t@xmath17  is about 1.9 mag fainter than the uit detection limit .",
    "latham & milone ( 1996 ) report that s975 is a binary with a period of 1221 days , and a small eccentricity @xmath25 .",
    "the probable presence of a hot subluminous companion in f90 , along with a nearly circular binary orbit , suggests that its blue straggler origin is also due to a binary mass - transfer process .",
    "note that while the hot companion of f131 is probably not a white dwarf ( since it is detected in the  d and  absorption lines ) , the nature of the hot companion of f90 is unknown .",
    "the star s1466 occupies the blue straggler region of the hr diagram , and is located @xmath26 from the center of m67 .",
    "however , the star is usually considered to be a non - member based on proper motion studies .",
    "the most precise proper motion study of m67 is that of girard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who give a 21% probability of cluster membership for s1466 .",
    "further study of s1466 is perhaps warranted , given that a blue straggler might acquire a peculiar velocity if its formation process is due to stellar interactions ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    to study the contribution of blue stragglers at other wavelengths , we perform a semi - empirical computation of the integrated m67 ultraviolet spectrum , using the list of stars with at least 80% probability of cluster membership from the astrometric studies of ( in order of preference ) girard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , zhao et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and sanders ( 1977 ) .",
    "although the list of proper motion members does not extend fainter than about v = 15 ( figure [ fig-2 ] ) , the fainter main - sequence stars should contribute negligible light below 3000   . for all but two of the proper motion members , v and  magnitudes could be obtained from the catalogs of mmj93 , sanders ( 1989 ) , girard et al .",
    "( 1989 ) or fan et al .",
    "effective temperatures are estimated from the dereddened  colors , using the t@xmath17    relation of lejeune et al .",
    "gravities are approximated by assuming a mass of 1.25 m@xmath2  for stars brighter than v=13 , and assuming @xmath18  = 4.5 for fainter stars . from the t@xmath17  and @xmath18  of each star , a model synthetic ultraviolet spectrum from the compilation of lejeune et al.(1997 )",
    "is assigned , normalized to the star s dereddened v magnitude .",
    "figure [ fig-4 ] shows the predicted integrated ultraviolet spectrum of m67 , with the blue straggler contribution shown separately from all other stars . even neglecting the possibly anomalous star f81 , the blue straggler contribution still dominates the integrated m67 spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 2600   .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig-4 ] compares the integrated spectra with synthetic spectra derived from the solar - metallicity isochrones computed by bruzual & charlot , and tabulated in leitherer et al .",
    "( 1996 , also see @xcite ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra are computed for an instantaneous starburst and a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "( we do not attempt to fit the integrated spectra shortward of 2100   , because the bruzual & charlot models include a contribution from the short - lived hot post - agb stars , which do not exist in the relatively small population of m67 . )",
    "if the blue stragglers are excluded , than a 4.5 gyr model provides the best fit to the semi - empirical integrated spectrum , which is in agreement with the age of m67 estimated from color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "however , if all the blue stragglers except f81 are included in the integrated spectrum , then a 2.5 gyr isochrone provides the best fit , and , in particular , provides a good fit of the spectral break at 2600   .",
    "thus , in this case , the neglect of blue stragglers in a population synthesis model of the unresolved ultraviolet spectrum would lead to a significant underestimate of the cluster age .",
    "there are at least two ways in which the blue straggler population of m67 might differ from that of galaxies of similar age .",
    "first , dynamical interactions of m67 with the galaxy have enhanced the relative contribution of blue stragglers to the integrated spectrum , because the low - mass stars have evaporated from the cluster , while blue stragglers are concentrated toward the cluster center ( mmj93 ) . a more important question concerns the origin of blue stragglers themselves ; whether they arise from primordial binaries either via mass transfer processes or stellar mergers , or whether they originate from stellar collisions enhanced by the moderately high stellar density ( 20 pc@xmath27 ; @xcite ) in the m67 center .",
    "while this stellar density is often exceeded in the cores of many elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) , the typical star density in elliptical galaxies or stellar bulges will be at least an order of magnitude lower .",
    "in fact , there is good evidence that both mass - transfer and stellar collision processes contribute to the m67 blue straggler population . the short - period ( 4.2d ) binary f190 has long been a good candidate for ongoing mass transfer ( @xcite ) , and the present work provides evidence that both f90 and f131 are algol - type mass - transfer systems . as noted above , landsman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) showed that the yellow giant s1040 is almost certainly a blue straggler descendant , and a product of early case b mass transfer . on the other hand",
    ", the bright blue straggler f81 has a mass larger than twice the turnoff mass , and the blue stragglers f55 , f238 , and f555 ( s997 ) have orbits with appreciable eccentricities ( @xcite ) .",
    "neither of these properties can be easily understood with a mass - transfer scenario , or mergers of primordial binaries , but are easily accommodated with binary - binary or binary - single star collisions ( @xcite ) .",
    "is the large contribution of blue stragglers to the integrated ultraviolet spectrum of m67 typical of other open clusters ?",
    "spinrad et al .  (",
    "1997 ) estimate that the blue straggler contribution to the cluster ultraviolet spectrum is higher for m67 than for any of the seven clusters they examined .",
    "ahumada & lapasset ( 1995 ) have compiled a catalog of blue stragglers in 390 open clusters , in which they tabulate both nbs , the number of blue stragglers in the cluster , and n2 , the number of stars on the main sequence to two magnitudes below the turnoff .",
    "the ratio nbs / n2 is 0.15 for m67 , about twice the mean of the entire open cluster population .",
    "we do not pursue this comparison any further here , but instead make the following two points .",
    "first , the best way to detect the presence of blue stragglers in an unresolved population is to have wide spectral coverage , including both ultraviolet and visible bandpasses .",
    "second , evolutionary models of close binaries including mass transfer ( e.g.  @xcite ) would be a useful addition to galaxy population synthesis models , especially for those spectral regions expected to be dominated by the stellar turn - off population .",
    "figure [ fig-2 ] shows that three uit sources are coincident with faint hot sources in mmj93 , and occupy the white dwarf region in the lower left - hand corner of the hr diagram .",
    "four other uit sources are outside of the region studied by mmj93 , but are coincident with faint , hot stars in the batc ( beijing - arizona - taipei - connecticut ) intermediate - band spectrophotometric survey of fan et al .",
    "the uit photometry of these seven white dwarf candidates , along with that of the yellow giant  white dwarf binary s1040 is given in column 4 of table [ tbl-4 ] .",

    "column 5 gives the distance of the white dwarf candidates from the star s1023 , assumed to be the cluster center .",
    "the brightest of the white dwarf candidates ( and the fifth brightest source in m67 at 1520   ) is mmj 5670 ( v @xmath28 ) , which is also star g152 in gilliland et al .",
    "this star was suspected to be responsible for the soft component of a blended rosat x - ray source in m67 discovered by belloni et al .",
    "subsequent optical spectroscopy by pasquini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and fleming et al.(1997 ) demonstrated that mmj5670 is a hot da white dwarf .",

    "only 10% of hot ( @xmath31 20,000 k ) white dwarfs are x - ray luminous ( @xcite ) , and this fraction is much lower for white dwarfs with t@xmath17",
    "@xmath31 50,000 k , because the x - ray emission in hot white dwarfs can be strongly suppressed by the presence of radiatively supported trace metals in the photosphere ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "presuming cluster membership ( see below ) , mmj 5973 is the first db white dwarf found in an open cluster , and shows that both db and da white dwarfs can be produced in the same cluster .",
    "the origin of the distinction between da and db white dwarfs is still a matter of some debate .",
    "the high surface helium abundance of db white dwarfs might arise if the db stars are descended from stars that left the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) during a helium shell flash ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "as opposed to this `` primordial '' scenario , surface phenomena such as mass loss , gravitational settling and convective overturn might provide an evolutionary path between db and da white dwarfs , provided that the hydrogen surface layer is sufficiently thin ( @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , all three of the spectroscopically studied white dwarfs in m67 have turned out to have unusual characteristics ; mmj 5670 is a very hot x - ray - luminous da , mmj 5973 is a db , and the s1040 companion is a very low mass core - helium white dwarf .",
    "no spectra exist for the five faintest white dwarf candidates in table [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "the three faintest sources ( mmj 6061 , batc 2776 , batc 3337 ) are near the uit detection limit , and are best considered as three sigma detections .",
    "the sources batc 4672 (= 0.46 ) and batc 3009 (= 0.24 ) have redder optical colors than expected for a hot white dwarf , and thus might be white dwarf  red dwarf binaries .    the approximate sensitivity limit of the uit image of m67 at 1520    is m@xmath9  = 16.6 or @xmath36 erg s@xmath14 @xmath37 @xmath14 .",
    "using the field white dwarf luminosity function and scale height ( 275 pc ) of boyle ( 1989 ) , only 1.26 white dwarfs brighter than this limit are predicted to be within the uit @xmath7 diameter field of view at the galactic latitude and reddening of m67 .",

    ", we summarize below the main results derived from the uit observations of m67 , ngc 188 , and ngc 6791 , and their implications for the study of the integrated ultraviolet spectra of old stellar populations .    1 .   the uit image of m67 is dominated by the eleven detected blue stragglers ; in particular , the blue straggler f81 contributes 90% of the integrated flux of m67 at 1520   .",
    "the ultraviolet flux of the two blue stragglers , f90 and f131 , is significantly higher than that predicted on the basis of optical photometry , and probably indicates the presence of hot , subluminous companions .",
    "a semi - empirical calculation of the integrated ultraviolet spectrum of m67 shows that , even when neglecting the possibly anomalous star f81 , the blue stragglers dominate at wavelengths shorter than @xmath4 2600   . as pointed out by spinrad et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , neglect of blue stragglers in population synthesis model fits of the rest - frame near - ultraviolet spectra of a galaxy will result in an underestimate of the galaxy age .",
    "2 .   eight white dwarf candidates are identified in the uit image of m67 , including the core - helium white dwarf companion of the yellow giant s1040 .",
    "optical spectroscopy of two of these sources has been obtained by fleming et al .",
    "( 1997 ) : g152 is a hot ( t@xmath17@xmath4 68,000 k ) da white dwarf , and mmj 5973 is cooler ( t@xmath17  @xmath4 18,000 k ) db white dwarf .",
    "the number of white dwarf candidates is in reasonable agreement with that expected from theoretical white dwarf cooling models and a cluster age of 4 gyr .",
    "the integrated ultraviolet flux at 1500    along a white dwarf cooling model is @xmath48 e@xmath49 l@xmath43 gyr @xmath14 , and the contribution of white dwarfs to the integrated spectra of old galaxies is roughly 10% of that expected from hot post - agb stars .",
    "eight probable cluster members are detected on the uit image of ngc 6791 , including the five hot subdwarfs studied spectroscopically by liebert et al.(1994 ) , and the two additional sdb / o candidates , b9 and b10 , reported by kaluzny & rucinski ( 1995 ) .",
    "three probable cluster members are detected on the uit image of ngc 188 , including the sdb spectroscopic binary ii-91 .",
    "the star d702 in ngc 188 is probably a composite including a hot subdwarf , since it has a hot ultraviolet color ( m@xmath9  ",
    "m@xmath10  = 0.11 ) , but a relatively cool optical color (  = 0.26 ) . the derived luminosity range , @xmath1 l / l@xmath2  @xmath53 , of the five sdb stars in ngc 6791 , and ii-91 in ngc 188 , is consistent with that expected for metal - rich , hot hb stars .",
    "the fraction of hot hb stars in both clusters is about 30% , implying that the integrated spectra of both clusters should show a pronounced uv - upturn , as strong as that observed in any elliptical galaxy .",
    "we thank the many people involved with the _ astro-2 _ mission who made these observations possible .",
    "we thank p. bergeron for his white dwarf atmosphere models , a. milone for providing the latest status of the m67 radial velocity monitoring , and d. dinescu for providing an electronic version of her ngc 188 catalog .",
