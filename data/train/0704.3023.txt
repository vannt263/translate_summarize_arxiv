    "the basic idea is to restrict the yang - mills path integral to those gauge field configurations , which can be represented by a linear superposition of a small number of localized building blocks , e.g.  instantons , merons , akyrons or calorons .",
    "these models have been quite successful when dealing with problems related to confinement : the potential between two static charges is linear for large separations , there is a confinement deconfinement phase transition , and various quantities , e.g.  the topological susceptibility or the critical temperature , are of the right order of magnitude compared to lattice results .    until now",

    "after a coupling constant renormalization our pseudoparticle results are in excellent agreement with analytical results , both for homogeneous chiral condensate @xcite and for spatially inhomogeneous chiral condensate @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec_008 ] , we give a summary and a brief outlook regarding the application of the pseudoparticle approach to qcd",
    "in previous papers @xcite we have discussed in detail , how to apply the pseudoparticle approach to bosonic fields , in particular to the su(2 ) gauge field . in this section",
    "we propose a method to incorporate fermionic fields .",

    "note that assuming orthonormality is not a restriction .",
    "given any set of linearly independent pseudoparticles @xmath18 one can easily define suitable linear combinations @xmath19 , which are orthonormal . up to an additive constant , which is irrelevant for the partition function , the result for the pseudoparticle regularized effective action is the same both for pseudoparticles @xmath18 and for pseudoparticles @xmath6 : @xmath20      in the following we argue that the @xmath2-regularization ( [ eqn_001 ] ) is not suited to produce physically meaningful results .    the problem of the @xmath2-regularization is the following : applying the dirac operator @xmath2 to one of the pseudoparticles @xmath21 in general yields a function , which is ( partially ) outside the pseudoparticle function space @xmath22 , i.e.@xmath23 with @xmath24 normalized and @xmath25 .",
    "if + @xmath26 , the situation is uncritical .",

    "if @xmath2 is hermitian , the problem can be made even more transparent by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath13 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a unitary matrix and @xmath33 are the eigenvalues of @xmath34 . because of @xmath35 , @xmath36 now the problem is obvious : according to @xmath37 @xmath38 contributes to the pseudoparticle regularized determinant of @xmath2 as eigenmode with eigenvalue @xmath33 .",
    "however , applying @xmath2 to @xmath38 may yield a function , which is ( partially ) outside the pseudoparticle function space @xmath22 , i.e.@xmath39 if @xmath40 , @xmath38 is far from being an eigenfunction of @xmath2 , and @xmath33 is , of course , not related to any of the eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",
    "the most extreme case is @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath38 is then an `` unphysical pseudoparticle zero mode '' : although @xmath38 is not a zero mode of @xmath2 , and although @xmath2 might not even have a zero mode , @xmath38 contributes to the pseudoparticle regularized determinant of @xmath2 with eigenvalue + @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , the effective action ( [ eqn_001 ] ) blows up to infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "if we would use additional pseudoparticles with non vanishing overlap to @xmath43 , @xmath38 would not enter the determinant as zero mode anymore",
    ".    even if there are no unphysical pseudoparticle zero modes , there might still be unphysical low lying pseudoparticle modes , i.e.  modes with @xmath40 , which also spoil numerical results .",
    "the following example shows that such unphysical low lying pseudoparticle modes are quite common .",
    "the example in sec .",
    "[ sec_004 ] and the @xmath2-regularized pseudoparticle gross - neveu results from sec .",
    "[ sec_007 ] demonstrate that these modes usually give rise to wrong and useless results .",
    "we consider the antihermitian operator @xmath44 , + @xmath45 , antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath44 are plane waves and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by @xmath46    alternatively , we compute the `` pseudoparticle eigenvalues '' @xmath33 and @xmath47 defined in ( [ eqn_003 ] ) , where we use overlapping `` hat functions '' as pseudoparticles .",
    "to be more precise , we apply antiperiodic b - spline basis functions of degree @xmath48 , i.e.@xmath49 @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ sec_009 ] ) .    in table",
    "[ tab_001 ] we compare the `` true eigenvalues '' @xmath51 with the pseudoparticle eigenvalues @xmath33 .",

    "as we have discussed , the pseudoparticle eigenvalues are quite similar to certain true eigenvalues as long as @xmath53 .",

    "eigenvalues @xmath51 , pseudoparticle eigenvalues @xmath33 and @xmath47 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     note that such unphysical pseudoparticle zero modes are not specific for b - spline pseudoparticles . for odd @xmath54 and",
    "any choice of localized , real - valued and uniformly distributed pseudoparticles @xmath6 , i.e.@xmath55 @xmath50 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , one can easily show that @xmath60 is perpendicular to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 is an unphysical pseudoparticle zero mode of @xmath44 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath62 in the @xmath16-regularized effective action ( [ eqn_002 ] ) do not suffer from the problem discussed in the previous section .",
    "the reason is the following : both the left hand sides @xmath63 and the right hand sides @xmath64 might be outside the pseudoparticle function space @xmath22 , but they form the same function space , @xmath65 , in which their overlap is computed .",
    "for example , it is easy to show that any pseudoparticle zero mode of @xmath16 is necessarily a `` true zero '' mode of @xmath16 : if @xmath66 is a pseudoparticle zero mode of @xmath16 , then @xmath67 ; this implies @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is easy to show that using complete but possibly different orthonormal sets of functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 on the left hand side and on the right hand side of any operator @xmath2 to calculate its determinant yields the determinant with exception of a phase factor , i.e.@xmath72    as we have already stressed , the problem of the @xmath2-regularization ( [ eqn_001 ] ) is that @xmath29 is ( partially ) perpendicular to @xmath22 . on the other hand , when considering operators , where @xmath14 is real and positive , we are only interested in the absolute value of the determinant .",
    "therefore , according to ( [ eqn_005 ] ) we propose to consider matrix elements with different `` pseudoparticles '' on the left hand side and on the right hand side :    * right hand side : any choice of pseudoparticles @xmath21 .",
    "* left hand side : `` pseudoparticles '' @xmath18 with + @xmath73 .",
    "this assures that @xmath2 applied to any pseudoparticle @xmath21 yields an element of the left hand side function space . in other words ,",
    "the best choice for the left hand side is to use basis functions @xmath18 with @xmath73 , because other perpendicular / partially perpendicular basis functions have no / not enough overlap to @xmath29 , and this in turn leads to unphysical pseudoparticle zero modes / low lying modes .",
    "one can show that @xmath74 i.e.  this line of reasoning also leads to the @xmath16-regularization ( [ eqn_002 ] ) .      in the following we point out that there are certain relations between the @xmath16-regularization of the pseudoparticle approach and finite mode regularization @xcite .",
    "let @xmath75 be orthonormalized eigenfunctions and @xmath76 the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath16 , i.e.@xmath77 of course , @xmath76 is real and @xmath78 , because of @xmath79 in the following we consider the eigenvalues ordered according to their absolute value , i.e.  @xmath80 moreover , we differentiate between `` low lying eigenvalues '' @xmath81 and `` large eigenvalues '' @xmath82 :    * * large eigenvalues * + in applications of the pseudoparticle approach , bosonic fields @xmath3 have typical maximum values ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is both the pseudoparticle regularization and the exponential damping factor @xmath83 in the partition function .",
    "the same is true for the `` potential '' @xmath84 in the dirac operator + @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , plane waves @xmath86 with large wave numbers @xmath87 are approximate eigenfunctions of @xmath16 ( `` the derivative dominates the potential '' ) . both the eigenfunctions @xmath88 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath89 , + @xmath90 , are nearly independent of the bosonic fields @xmath3 . * * low lying eigenvalues",
    "* + low lying eigenvalues @xmath76 and the corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath75 , @xmath91 , may exhibit a strong @xmath3-dependence . because the bosonic fields @xmath3 have typical maximum values , there is only a finite number of low lying eigenvalues .",
    "finite mode regularization of @xmath92 amounts to considering only a finite number of low lying eigenvalues , i.e.@xmath93 of course , this equation is not an equality in the usual sense .",
    "the hope is rather that physical observables can be computed correctly via the partition function , when using ( [ eqn_008 ] ) in the effective action , and when performing a suitable renormalization ,    to exhibit the relation between the @xmath16-regularization of the pseudoparticle approach and finite mode regularization , it is convenient to diagonalize the matrix + @xmath62 : @xmath94 where @xmath32 is a unitary matrix and @xmath33 are the eigenvalues of @xmath62 . because of @xmath35 , @xmath95    in the following we assume that the pseudoparticles @xmath6 have been chosen such that the low lying eigenfunctions @xmath75 , @xmath91 , can be approximated",
    ". then @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xmath98 .",
    "that is , the low lying , @xmath3-dependent pseudoparticle eigenfunctions @xmath38 and the pseudoparticle eigenvalues @xmath33 are nearly identical to the true eigenfunctions @xmath99 and eigenvalues @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the contribution of these pseudoparticle eigenmodes to the pseudoparticle regularized determinant of @xmath16 is identical to the contribution of the corresponding true eigenmodes in finite mode regularization ( cf .",
    "( [ eqn_008 ] ) and ( [ eqn_010 ] ) ) .",
    "all other pseudoparticle eigenfunctions are essentially linear combinations of the remaining true eigenfunctions : @xmath101 @xmath102 ( there is no contribution from @xmath103 , because the pseudoparticle eigenmodes are orthonormal due to the hermiticity of @xmath62 ) .",
    "the corresponding pseudoparticle eigenvalues @xmath33 are given by @xmath104 @xmath102 , where ( [ eqn_007 ] ) and ( [ eqn_011 ] ) have been used .",
    "there are two important points :    * @xmath38 and @xmath33 , @xmath102 , are approximately independent of @xmath3 .",
    "that is , although the difference between these pseudoparticle eigenvalues @xmath33 and the true eigenvalues @xmath100 , @xmath102 , might be large , the pseudoparticle effective action merely differs by an additive constant , when compared to finite mode regularization .",
    "such an additive constant is , of course , irrelevant for the partition function .",
    "* @xmath105 , @xmath102 , i.e.  @xmath33 is large",
    ". therefore , possibly present weak @xmath3-dependencies of @xmath106 or @xmath100 or weak contributions from low lying eigenmodes @xmath75 , @xmath91 , do not have a strong impact on @xmath33 . assuming that there are not too many of these large pseudoparticle eigenmodes , their @xmath3-dependence is essentially negligible in the pseudoparticle regularized determinant of @xmath16 .",
    "it is also instructive to discuss the shortcoming of the @xmath2-regularization in this context . for hermitian @xmath2",
    "the above arguments and equations are quite similar : just replace @xmath16 by @xmath2 in ( [ eqn_006 ] ) to ( [ eqn_011 ] ) with exception of ( [ eqn_007 ] ) , which is of course not valid . ( [ eqn_012 ] ) must be replaced by @xmath107 the big difference compared to the @xmath16-regularization is that the true eigenvalues @xmath100 are , in general , not positive . therefore , the corresponding pseudoparticle eigenvalues @xmath33 , @xmath102 , are not necessarily large : due to intricate cancellations between positive and negative @xmath100 , there may very well be small pseudoparticle eigenvalues @xmath33 , which are strongly affected by small changes of @xmath106 or @xmath100 , because of a change of @xmath3 .",
    "in this example we compare the @xmath16-regularization , the @xmath2-regularization and finite mode regularization . to this end , we compute @xmath108 @xmath109 real , @xmath110 , antiperiodic boundary conditions .    * * finite mode regularization * + the eigenfunctions of @xmath111 are plane waves and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by @xmath112 according to ( [ eqn_008 ] ) the result is @xmath113 when using the @xmath114 `` lowest lying eigenmodes '' . for @xmath115 and @xmath116",

    "on the other hand , has a completely different shape , especially for small values of @xmath109 . as explained above",

    "note that we consider three times as many degrees of freedom in @xmath188-direction for the fermionic fields than for the chiral condensate .",
    "the reason is the following : in general , even low lying eigenfunctions of @xmath16 exhibit more oscillations than the chiral condensate @xmath109 ; on the other hand , the fermionic pseudoparticles must be able to approximate these low lying eigenfunctions , in order to produce correct results ; therefore the representation of the fermionic fields must be finer than the representation of the chiral condensate .    in accordance with sec .",
    "[ sec_007 ] we choose @xmath168 and @xmath166 .",
    "we determine the right phase boundary of the crystal phase by computing the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix of the @xmath16-regularized effective action ( [ eqn_014 ] ) with respect to @xmath189 at @xmath124 , i.e.@xmath190 negative eigenvalues indicate inhomogeneous perturbations of the chiral condensate @xmath124 , which decrease the effective action . this in turn is a clear sign of a crystal phase .",
    "of course , the argument does not work the other way round : if there are no negative eigenvalues , the chiral condensate is not necessarily vanishing ; @xmath124 may as well be a local minimum of the effective action ; however , a recent investigation of the gross - neveu model on the lattice strongly suggests that this is not the case @xcite .    a minor source of error when computing the right phase boundary is the finite extension of the space dimension .",
    "the problem is that the period of the analytically obtained chiral condensate ( [ eqn_015 ] ) might not `` fit in the periodic @xmath188-direction '' .",
    "if the period of the chiral condensate is a multiple of the spatial extension @xmath154 , everything works fine .",
    "however , if it is roughly halfway between two multiples , results differ a little bit ( cf .",
    "[ figure_006 ] , where the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath191 is shown as a function of @xmath192 [ @xmath193 , i.e.  @xmath194 ; for a space dimension of infinite extension the graph would be smooth , instead of exhibiting certain periodic oscillations ) .",

    "the resulting right phase boundary is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_007 ] together with the analytical result @xcite .",
    "up to @xmath198 there is excellent agreement . for larger values of @xmath192",
    "cutoff effects give rise to certain deviations : the analytically obtained chiral condensate ( [ eqn_015 ] ) oscillates heavily and , therefore , can not be represented by @xmath199 b - spline pseudoparticles anymore .",

    "one merely obtains the phase boundary of the phase diagram for homogeneous chiral condensate ( cf .",
    "[ figure_004]b ) .",
    "the reason is that minima of the effective action for @xmath200 are also minima of the effective action for varying @xmath109 ( however , not necessarily global minima ) , i.e.  the hessian matrix at such values for @xmath109 is positive definite . to get the correct phase boundary",
    ", one has to perform a minimization of the pseudoparticle effective action ( [ eqn_014 ] ) with respect to @xmath189 .",

    "another check of the pseudoparticle approach is to compare the chiral condensate obtained by minimizing the @xmath16-regularized effective action ( [ eqn_014 ] ) with the analytically obtained chiral condensate ( [ eqn_015 ] ) .",

    "we have pointed out that a naive pseudoparticle regularization , the @xmath2-regularization , is not suited for producing useful numerical results .",
    "the problem of this regularization is that applying the dirac operator to the pseudoparticles yields functions , which are partially outside the pseudoparticle function space .",
    "this gives rise to unphysical low lying modes or , in extreme cases , unphysical pseudoparticle zero modes , which spoil the determinant in the effective action .",
    "a slightly different regularization scheme , the @xmath16-regularization , does not suffer from this problem . to test this pseudoparticle regularization ,",

    "we have given a couple of arguments indicating certain relations between the @xmath16-regularization and finite mode regularization , which might explain these excellent results .",
    "the next step is to apply the pseudoparticle approach to qcd . of course , instead of using a large number of overlapping hat functions as pseudoparticles , as it has been done in this paper , the goal will rather be to use a small number of physically relevant fermionic pseudoparticles , probably pseudoparticles , which have significant overlap to low lying eigenfunctions of the qcd dirac operator .",
    "current research includes a study of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd in the pseudoparticle approach .",
    "we do this by computing the low lying eigenvalues of the dirac operator at different temperatures and relate the results to the chiral condensate via the banks - casher relation . of course , the goal is to obtain a model which exhibits chiral symmetry breaking and a confinement deconfinement phase transition at the same time",
    ". such a model could be useful for computing observables , which are difficult to access in lattice calculations , e.g.  pion masses or decay constants with realistically light quark masses .",
