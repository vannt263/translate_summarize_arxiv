    "nuclei are finite fermionic many - body systems which support many kinds of collective motion . while properties of high - frequency vibrations ( giant resonances ) may be well reproduced in the small - amplitude limit by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , some low - frequency vibrations exhibit a strongly anharmonic nature that the rpa can not describe .",
    "nuclear fission and shape coexistence phenomena also have such a large amplitude nature . in order to investigate these kinds of large amplitude collective motion",
    ", one would like to reduce the number of degrees of freedom to a few judiciously chosen slow collective coordinates .",
    "however , in nuclear systems , this task is not trivial , since there is no obvious separation of scales .    in molecular physics , where the masses of electrons are so much smaller than those of the atomic nuclei ,",
    "the electronic motion is normally much faster than nuclear motion .",
    "thus , the collective coordinates are usually functions of nuclear coordinates and the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation works very well . on the other hand , in nuclear physics , since a nucleus consists of neutrons and protons which have almost the same masses , both the definition of collective coordinates and the applicability of adiabatic assumption are never obvious .    although a large number of studies have been done to calculate the potential energy surface using the constrained hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory with a given generalised cranking ( or constraint ) operator , the choice of collective coordinate ( i.e. , the choice of cranking operators ) has been rather arbitrary in most cases .    in this paper",
    "we shall apply a special theory @xcite , that is designed to determine a self - consistent cranking operator for adiabatic large amplitude collective motion ( alacm ) .",
    "this theory provides a method to find approximate decoupled motion which is confined to a few dimensional submanifold of the configuration space , within the framework of classical hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "since most systems of practical interest are not exactly separable , it is important that the theory can provide a submanifold which is approximately decoupled .",
    "this method has been applied to problems in nuclear physics@xcite and in other fields ( see references in @xcite )    in nuclear collective motion which involves level crossings , the problem of adiabaticity versus diabaticity has been a long standing question since this problem was discussed by hill and wheeler@xcite . during a nuclear shape change ,",
    "the diabatic process is often more favoured than the adiabatic one@xcite .",
    "this raises the question whether an _ adiabatic _",
    "theory , such as alacm , can be used to shed some light on diabatic dynamics .",
    "an answer to this question is one of main goals of this paper .    in nuclear phenomena , it is well - known that the pairing ( superfluidity ) influences all low - frequency collective motion .",
    "a well - known example is the effect on the moment of inertia for rotational nuclei , which is always smaller than the rigid - body value at low spin , which can be explained as an effect of pairing correlations . at the same time , the ground states of heavy nuclei with open - shell configurations are reasonably well described by the superfluid bardeen - cooper - schrieffer bcs wave functions with energy gaps of about 1 mev .",
    "properties of both collective and non - collective ( quasiparticle ) excitations depend on size of the energy gap .",
    "furthermore , it has been argued by bertsch@xcite that nuclear shape change may be associated with the hopping of nucleon pairs by means of the pairing force . in this case , the pairing interaction and level crossings play an essential role to determine the collective mass ( `` hopping mass '' ) .",
    "according to these considerations , the pairing interaction should play a key role in understanding the large amplitude collective motion in nuclei , especially when level crossings are involved as the shape change is taking place .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the applicability of alacm for such a system with level crossings and a pairing force . the theory has not been applied to such systems before .    in this paper ,",
    "we study a model hamiltonian describing a system interacting through the pairing force .",
    "the model has a single - particle level crossing and multiple local minima , and thus may be regarded as a model for shape - coexistence phenomena . in sec .",
    "[ sec : alacm ] , the formalism of alacm is briefly recapitulated . in order to apply the alacm to a classical hamiltonian with a spurious component ( nambu - goldstone mode ) , a modified version of the local harmonic equations",
    "is formulated .",
    "the classical hamiltonian for a pairing hamiltonian is derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , both by using the mean - field ( in this case bcs ) theory and by applying a parametrisation which exactly conserves particle number .",
    "the results of numerical calculations for a simple two - level system are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and the conclusions and an outlook are summarised in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we briefly review the theory of alacm ( see ref.@xcite for a complete description ) . in this section",
    ", we use a summation convention where the repeated appearance of the same symbols ( @xmath0 ) in upper and lower indices denotes a sum over that symbol for all possible values .",
    "we also use the convention that a comma in a lower index indicates the derivative with respect to the coordinate , thus @xmath1 .",
    "the theory of adiabatic large amplitude collective motion ( alacm ) is applicable to a classical hamiltonian system which has kinetic terms only quadratic in momentum .",
    "we thus have to start with a truncated hamiltonian @xmath2 where the mass tensor @xmath3 , in general , depends on the coordinates @xmath4 and is defined by truncation of the hamiltonian to second order @xmath5 thus all terms more than quadratic in momentum are neglected . in the sense that the higher - order terms are small , this theory may be regarded as an _",
    "adiabatic _ theory in the small - velocity limit .",
    "the tensor @xmath6 , which is defined as the inverse of @xmath3 ( @xmath7 ) , plays the role of metric tensor in the riemannian formulation of local harmonic equations ( lhe ) below .",
    "collective coordinates @xmath8 and intrinsic ( non - collective ) coordinates @xmath9 which are approximately decoupled from each other , are assumed to be obtainable by making a point transformation , conserving the quadratic nature of eq.([h_ad ] ) , @xmath10 in this section , we use symbols ( @xmath11 ) for indices of original coordinates , ( @xmath12 ) for new coordinates after the transformation , ( @xmath13 ) for collective coordinates and ( @xmath14 ) for intrinsic coordinates .",
    "the new hamiltonian after the point transformations takes the form , @xmath15 where we have used the fact that for decoupled motion the mass tensor must be block - diagonal , @xmath16 besides the block - diagonality of mass tensor , we require the absence of both `` real '' and `` geometrical '' forces orthogonal to the decoupled manifold , @xmath17    in practice , these three decoupling conditions , ( [ mass_diagonal]),([real_force_cond ] ) and ( [ geometrical_force_cond ] ) , can not be satisfied exactly , except for special cases .",
    "thus , we need a method applicable to an approximately decoupled manifold . the riemannian formulation of lhe@xcite is the one we choose to use in this paper . in a case of a single collective coordinate ( @xmath18 )",
    ", the basic equations of this formalism can be written as @xmath19 here the covariant derivative ( denoted by @xmath20 ) in the l.h.s .",
    "of eq.([lhe_2 ] ) is defined by @xmath21 where the affine connection @xmath22 is defined with the help of metric tensor @xmath23 as @xmath24    the equations ( [ lhe_1 ] ) and ( [ lhe_2 ] ) can be solved iteratively , starting from a stationary point . in principle , the procedure to find a collective path is to find successive points at which an eigenvector @xmath25 of the covariant rpa equation ( [ lhe_2 ] ) satisfies the force condition ( [ lhe_1 ] ) at the same time .",
    "once we get a collective path @xmath26 in multi - dimensional configuration space , a collective hamiltonian is defined by evaluating the hamiltonian ( [ h_new ] ) on the path @xmath26 , @xmath27 where we assume a single collective coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "the quality of decoupling can be measured by comparing two different collective mass parameters that can be calculated in the theory .",
    "if we calculate the derivatives @xmath28 in terms of the tangents of the path , @xmath29 the other mass parameter can be obtained by using the eigenvectors @xmath25 of the covariant rpa equation .",
    "@xmath30 this is equal to @xmath31 if the decoupling is exact .",
    "therefore , we define the decoupling measure @xmath32 as @xmath33 the size of this measure @xmath32 indicates the badness of decoupling .    if the decoupling is good , the motion orthogonal to @xmath26 ( motion in directions of @xmath9 ) becomes irrelevant in classical systems .",
    "however , it is not necessarily the case in quantum systems , because , according to the uncertain relation principle , we can not require @xmath34 ( the motion is confined on @xmath26 ) and @xmath35 at the same time .",
    "therefore , one may need to include the energy correction into the potential @xmath36 , which arises from quantum fluctuation with respect to the intrinsic degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the collective hamiltonian @xmath37 will be quantised in a flat space ( @xmath38 ) to obtain physical quantities , such as energies and wave functions .",
    "the most practical and straightforward way to investigate a pairing hamiltonian would be to utilise the mean - field ( bcs ) approximation ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bcs_parametrization ] ) in which the general product wave functions are no longer eigenstates of the particle number .",
    "when an intrinsic ground state breaks a ( continuous ) symmetry of hamiltonian , generally speaking , a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) mode will appear .",
    "this mode corresponds to an `` excitation '' to connect degenerate vacua . in the case of particle - number",
    "breaking , this is often called `` pairing rotation '' .",
    "we are interested in finding a collective coordinate orthogonal to this trivial mode .",
    "it is also well - known that , at equilibrium points , the ng mode has zero excitation energy and is decoupled from the other modes in the rpa order .",
    "thus , one may easily separate this mode from the other physical modes ( unless the physical mode happens to be zero energy ) .",
    "however , the ng mode does not necessarily have zero energy at non - equilibrium points .",
    "since we have to solve the lhe at each point on the collective path , it is not trivial to distinguish the ng mode from the other modes .",
    "therefore , in this section , we provide a modified formulation of lhe which fixes a value of the coordinate corresponding to the ng mode . in the bcs parametrisation , we need the constraints to fix the particle number and gauge angle ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bcs_parametrization ] ) .",
    "we shall make use of the fact that the coordinate and momenta corresponding to the ng mode are explicitly known .",
    "we shall only discuss the case of a single collective coordinate @xmath18 and a single ng mode .",
    "first we divide the set @xmath39 into three subsets , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath9 , @xmath42 , which are assumed to be obtained by point transformations @xmath43 @xmath41 represents a coordinate for a ng mode and @xmath40 for a collective coordinate now we are trying to determine . in the case that the translational symmetry is broken , @xmath41 and @xmath44 would be the centre - of - mass coordinate and the total momentum , respectively .",
    "in the case of particle - number breaking , they correspond to the particle number and the gauge angle . in all these cases we know the explicit form of the coordinates and momenta for the ng mode(s ) .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath41 and @xmath44 as functions of original coordinates @xmath4 and momenta @xmath45 .",
    "although in general @xmath41 and @xmath44 have arbitrary dependence on @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we expand them with respect to @xmath47 up to the zero - th order for @xmath41 and up to first order for @xmath44 . in keeping with the adiabatic character of the theory , then",
    ", we get @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "an example will be shown in the next section for the particle number and the gauge angle .",
    "the conditions for decoupling are again given by three equations ( [ mass_diagonal ] ) , ( [ real_force_cond ] ) and ( [ geometrical_force_cond ] ) , where @xmath50 and ng . in this section",
    "we use symbols ( @xmath13 ) representing 1 and ng . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown that the third decoupling condition ( [ geometrical_force_cond ] ) implies that the decoupled surface is a geodesic .",
    "the geodesic surface is defined by differential equations @xmath51 where the affine connection @xmath22 is defined by eq.([affine_1 ] ) and @xmath52 in new coordinates is in the same manner @xmath53    now we consider constraints @xmath54 which freeze the ng degree of freedom .",
    "the poisson bracket between these two constraints is @xmath55 . in order to facilitate the calculation of differentiation , we need to define a dirac bracket@xcite by @xmath56 first we consider the force condition corresponding to eq.([lhe_1 ] ) . we differentiate the potential @xmath57 with respect to @xmath4 keeping the constraints @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 where the decoupling condition ( [ real_force_cond ] ) has been used .",
    "this can be calculated by using the dirac bracket as @xmath61 equating the above two equations , we obtain the force condition @xmath62 in the case of pairing rotation , @xmath63 may be taken as the average particle number @xmath64 .",
    "then , @xmath65 can be regarded as a chemical potential @xmath66 and eq.([clhe_1 ] ) may be rewritten in the form similar to the constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov equation @xmath67    in order to obtain the covariant rpa equation corresponding to eq.([lhe_2 ] ) , we start with the contravariant derivative of the potential @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    ". again we differentiate this equation with respect to @xmath4 in keeping with @xmath71 .",
    "the derivative of the l.h.s .",
    "is easily calculated as @xmath72 the derivative of the r.h.s .",
    "is calculated in terms of the dirac bracket .",
    "@xmath73 where , from the second to the third lines , we used the geodesic equation ( [ geodesic_2 ] ) and the covariant derivative defined by @xmath74 from eqs.([temp_2 ] ) and ( [ temp_3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath75 replacing @xmath76 by @xmath77 , this becomes the covariant rpa equation to determine eigenfrequencies @xmath78 and eigenvecotors @xmath25 .",
    "it is worth noting that any solution @xmath25 of eq.([clhe_2 ] ) with non - zero eigenfrequency is orthogonal to the ng mode .",
    "this may be understood as follows : one multiplies eq.([clhe_2 ] ) by @xmath79 and takes sum over @xmath80 . then , since the l.h.s . becomes @xmath81 , it results in @xmath82 therefore , with @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 .",
    "since the ng mode emerges only when we break a symmetry of hamiltonian , one may expect that the clhe formalism should become the usual lhe when the underlying symmetry is unbroken . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the bcs approximation to derive a classical hamiltonian system . in the parametrisation of eq .",
    "( [ mass_parameter_bcs ] ) and ( [ potential_bcs ] ) , a state with @xmath85 and @xmath86 corresponds to a state in a normal phase which is an eigenstate of particle number ( from eq.([adiabatic_gap ] ) , one can see the pairing gap vanish in this case ) .",
    "then , from eq.([f_ng ] ) , we have @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the clhe ( [ clhe_1 ] ) and ( [ clhe_2 ] ) become equivalent to the lhe ( [ lhe_1 ] ) and ( [ lhe_2 ] ) .    the equations ( [ clhe_1 ] ) and ( [ clhe_2 ] ) are the defining equations of clhe formalism .",
    "as in the usual lhe , we require the self - consistency between these two equations : a solution of eq.([clhe_2 ] ) should satisfies eq.([clhe_1 ] ) at the same time . in this paper , where we concentrate on a simple model ,",
    "it is easier to solve the constraints @xmath58 and @xmath59 explicitly and describe everything by independent canonical variables @xmath88 ( @xmath89 .",
    "however , in the realistic cases for which it is difficult to solve the constraints , this clhe formalism would become more useful .",
    "we consider a simple model where particles coupled to a harmonic oscillator interact through the pairing force , first introduced by fukui , matsuo and matsuyanagi@xcite in order to study shape mixing .",
    "this model can be regarded as a vibrating core plus valence particles which can move between different levels by the pairing force , @xmath90 where @xmath91 and we assume @xmath92 . here",

    "we have done this in two different ways .",
    "one is based on the time - dependent mean - field ( bcs ) theory in which states are not eigenstates of particle number .",
    "it is inevitable that this introduces a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) mode ( pairing rotation ) in the theory .",
    "we have developed the constrained local harmonic formalism which can treat this spurious component and find a path orthogonal to the ng mode in the configuration space .",
    "the other is based on the exact time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "it is possible to derive a classical hamilton s equation for a simple two - level system by regarding the mixing angle and the relative phase as canonical variables , though this becomes more complicated when the number of levels increases . in this parametrisation , states are always eigenstates of particle number and there is no ng mode .    using the mean - field parametrisation ( neglecting fock terms ) , we have found that the system exhibits completely different collective paths depending on the strength of pairing force . for a weak pairing force",
    ", the collective path can not connect one local minimum with another . on the other hand ,",
    "a path which connects two local minima is obtained for the case of a strong pairing force . in this model ,",
    "different local minima correspond to different configurations of valence particles .",
    "therefore , the strength of pairing force determines either adiabatic or diabatic behaviours of the system .    using the parametrisation of the exact time - dependent schrdinger equation , if @xmath199 , a collective path starting from a local minimum always passes through a saddle point and reach the other minimum . for the strong paring force ,",
    "the path is very smooth and is well decoupled from the other degree of freedom orthogonal to the path .",
    "however , for the weak pairing force , the path shows a peculiar behaviour ( back - bending ) on the way where the decoupling is very bad .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the mean - field results .",
    "we have requantised the 1-dimensional collective hamiltonian and compared the spectra and transition matrix elements with exact calculations . for the strong pairing force ,",
    "the agreement is excellent for any kind of adiabatic approximation ( bo , alacm ) .",
    "however , for the weak pairing , the bo approximation fails to reproduce the qualitative features of exact spectra , while the alacm well reproduces the low - lying spectra and transition amplitudes .",
    "the agreement becomes worse for the higher - lying states beyond a barrier height between two local minima .",
    "the theory is based on the adiabatic assumption in which hamiltonians are expanded with respect to momentum up to second order .",
    "thus , this disagreement may come from the higher - order terms we have neglected , because the higher - lying states are supposed to have larger momenta .",
    "we have also discussed the effect of gauge potentials arising from change of intrinsic states along the path .",
    "inclusion of these potentials turns out to improve the bo calculations considerably but to leave the alacm results almost unchanged .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have studied the same model hamiltonian and concluded that for the case of a weak pairing force the adiabatic approach ( bo approximation ) is not appropriate for describing the system and the diabatic approach is needed .",
    "however , one should bear in mind that , in the bo approximation , the collective coordinate @xmath97 was chosen by assuming that the motion of valence particles described by @xmath253 is much faster than the motion along @xmath97 .",
    "this is apparently not the case for the weak paring @xmath254 . in our adiabatic approach ,",
    "all degrees of freedom are treated equivalently , taking account of the mass tensor in the multi - dimensional configuration space .",
    "thus the collective path is very much different from the one in the bo approximation for the case of weak pairing .",
    "actually , the collective path turns out to represent the completely diabatic dynamics in some cases .",
    "therefore , if one has a decoupled path determined by the system itself , the _ adiabatic _ theory may account for the _ diabatic _ dynamics .    for the practical applications of the alacm theory , generally speaking ,",
    "it is not easy to solve the constraints about the ng mode explicitly . since nuclei show many kinds of symmetry breaking ( translational symmetry , rotational symmetry , gauge symmetry ) , the constrained local harmonic formalism discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : clhe ] will be very useful in such cases .",
    "we shall apply this method to more realistic problems in the near future .    in conclusion ,",
    "the alacm improves on the conventional bo theory .",
    "it works well even when the mass of valence hamiltonian is smaller than that of the core hamiltonian , because , in principle , the alacm treats all degrees of freedom equivalently .",
    "the alacm fails to reproduce properties of higher - lying states in the case of weak pairing .",
    "this is definitely due to a limitation of the adiabatic theory . upon requantisation ,",
