    "in the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation , massive galaxies are formed through merger and accretion .",

    "in addition , they are distributed out to a few virial radii of the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , they are excellent probes of the dark matter halos surrounding the host galaxies",
    ".    a great deal of effort has been made to understand the spatial distribution of satellite galaxies around their host galaxies .",
    "the radial distribution of the observed satellites was found to be more concentrated than that of subhalos around galaxy - sized halos in n - body simulations @xcite , but consistent with dark matter distribution @xcite .",
    "the studies of color dependence on the radial distribution of satellites revealed that the radial distribution of red satellites is more centrally concentrated than that of blue satellites @xcite .",
    "similarly , the radial distribution of early morphological type satellites is more centrally concentrated than that of late - type satellites @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution of satellite galaxies is also an issue , which has been extensively addressed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting issue is the kinematic properties of satellite galaxies .",
    "satellite galaxies can be divided into two classes based on their orbital motion : those in prograde orbit that rotate around the host in the same direction as the rotation of the host , and those in retrograde orbit that rotate in the opposite direction .",
    "several important questions have been raised for these two classes : ( 1 ) what the number ratio of galaxies in prograde orbit to those in retrograde orbit is ; ( 2 ) what the amplitude of mean bulk rotation of satellites is ; and ( 3 ) whether there is a difference in physical properties between them .",
    "@xcite searched for the satellites around late - type spiral galaxies with a luminosity similar to the milky way , and found 69 satellites around 45 host galaxies ( @xmath71.5 satellites per host ) . for 35 satellites",
    "whose orbital velocity directions were determined , they detected a small amount of rotation for the satellite systems , @xmath8 km s@xmath3 , in the same sense as the rotation of hosts disk .",
    "they also found that the number of satellites in prograde orbit is nearly equal to that in retrograde orbit .",
    "however , in ngc 5084 , @xcite detected nine satellite galaxies , and found a clear excess of satellites in retrograde orbit ( eight in retrograde orbit and one in prograde orbit ) . using the expanded catalog of 115 satellites around 69 host galaxies , @xcite found that the number of galaxies in prograde orbit is almost the same as that of galaxies in retrograde orbit .",
    "recently , @xcite measured the direction of rotation for some host galaxies in the list of satellite systems of @xcite , and secured 76 satellites associated with 43 host galaxies of which orbital directions were determined . with this sample",
    ", they found that the fraction of galaxies in prograde orbit ( @xmath9 ) is @xmath10 , which is slightly larger than the previous results ( @xmath11 in @xcite ) , but is broadly consistent with those from their @xmath12-body simulation ( @xmath13 ) . in the catalog of satellite systems extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite )",
    "data release 6 @xcite , @xcite determined the direction of rotation of some host galaxies by spectroscopic observations .",
    "they obtained the data for 78 satellites associated with 63 hosts . combining these data with those for the satellites in @xcite",
    ", they found that the fraction of galaxies in prograde orbit is still @xmath14 , and mean bulk rotation of satellites is @xmath15 km s@xmath3 , in the same sense as the rotation of hosts disk .",
    "interestingly , they found that the peculiar velocity distribution of satellites is not a single gaussian , but is described as the sum of two gaussians .    as summarized above , most studies focused on the first two issues , the fraction of galaxies in prograde orbit and the amplitude of mean bulk rotation of satellites .",
    "the difference in physical properties between them , which is very important to understand the formation of satellite systems , has not been explored much . moreover ,",
    "the direction of rotation of host galaxy that is essential to know the orbit of satellites , has been determined by the expensive spectroscopic observations .    in this paper",
    ", we determine the direction of rotation of host galaxies using the color images provided by the sdss without conducting spectroscopic observations ( see  [ spin ] for details ) , and present the results of a study on the dependence of various physical properties of satellite galaxies on their orbits ( prograde and retrograde orbits ) . in this paper we mean by ` satellites ' as the galaxies that are much fainter than their host galaxies that are isolated from other bright galaxies .",
    "therefore , they are like the conventional satellites associated with the milky way or andromeda , and are rather different from the ` satellites ' used in the n - body simulations or group / cluster studies where all galaxies ( or dark halos ) other than the brightest one ( or the most massive one ) are called satellites .",

    "finding isolated satellite systems consists of two steps : identifying isolated galaxies and finding satellites associated with the isolated galaxies .",
    "we consider all sdss galaxies with redshifts less than 0.03 as the host candidates .",
    "only the relatively nearby galaxies are considered because the visual determination of the sense of rotation is feasible only when the galaxy image shows detailed internal features . for each galaxy",

    "the part of minor axis behind the bulge often appears smooth due to the foreground bulge stars while the side of the minor axis closer than the bulge often shows interstellar dust patches of relatively higher sharpness @xcite .",
    "when it is not possible to determine the sense of rotation due to various reasons , we simply drop the host galaxy .",
    "very early - type galaxies with smooth disks , very late - type galaxies with vanishing bulge , and nearly face - on or edge - on disk galaxies are difficult to assign the spin direction .",

    ", we have 727 satellites assigned to 230 hosts whose spin vector directions are known .    among 727 satellites , we eliminated 45 spurious sources ( e.g. , faint fragments of bright galaxies , diffraction spikes of bright stars ) that were included in the list of satellites ( originally included in the spectroscopic sample of galaxies in sdss ) by inspecting color images of the satellites . in the result ,",
    "682 satellites with 221 host galaxies remain .",
    "it is noted that our list contains some satellite systems whose host galaxies are early types because their spin directions were determined from the spectroscopic observations .",
    "since the morphology of satellite galaxies is strongly affected by the morphology of host galaxies as found in @xcite , we further divide the satellites into two categories ( the cases of early- and late - type hosts ) and obtain 197 late - type host galaxies having 579 satellite galaxies and 24 early - type hosts with 103 satellites .",

    "the sfa of early - type satellites in retrograde orbit ( er ) also appears to be stronger than those in prograde orbit in the outer region ( @xmath120 ) as seen in figures [ fig - ur ] and [ fig - halpha ] .",
    "moreover , ( @xmath6 ) colors of late - type satellites increase as they approach their host galaxies for both satellites in prograde and retrograde orbits , and ( @xmath6 ) colors of late - type satellites in retrograde orbit in the innermost region ( @xmath116 ) are remarkably large . these differences depending on the orbit can be attributed to the different origin of satellite galaxies , or to the different strength of physical processes that they experience through interactions with host galaxies .    to check whether or not these results are strongly affected by the satellites associated to the host galaxies whose spin direction is determined from the sdss color images in this study , in figure [ fig - urspec ] , we plot ( @xmath6 ) colors versus the projected distance to the hosts using the satellites associated to the host galaxies whose spin direction is determined from the spectroscopic observations . for both early and late types , we do not find any significant difference of ( @xmath6 ) colors between satellites in prograde and retrograde orbits , which is consistent with the result when we use the combined sample of satellites in the host galaxies whose spin direction is determined from the color images or the spectroscopic observations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - ur ] ) .",
    "in addition , the late - type satellites in prograde orbits ( lp ) show an increase in ( @xmath6 ) color as decreasing @xmath4 , which is again similar to the case of late types in prograde orbits using the combined sample of satellites ( see lp in fig .",

    "[ tab - inout ] ) . in the result",
    ", the results of sfa using the combined sample of satellites are not affected strongly by the satellites associated to the host galaxies whose spin direction is determined from the color images in this study .    since the physical parameters of satellite galaxies can be strongly affected by the morphology of host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is also interesting to compare satellite systems that have early- and late - type host galaxies . to investigate the sfa of satellites around early - type hosts we use a sample of 101 satellites associated with 24 early - type hosts , and",
    "show their ( @xmath6 ) colors in figure [ fig - urearly ] .",
    "it is seen that ( @xmath6 ) colors of late - type satellites become redder as @xmath4 decreases , which was also seen in figure [ fig - ur ] or [ fig - urspec ] . for early - type satellites ,",
    "the small number of satellites prevents us from drawing any firm conclusion .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite found that galaxy properties strongly depend on the distance and the morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy .",
    "for example , the sfa of galaxies is enhanced as they approach late - type neighbors of comparable luminosity , while it is reduced as they approach early - type neighbors .",
    "the structure parameters of galaxies change with the distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy in the same direction independently of neighbor s morphology .",
    "galaxy properties start to change when galaxies approach their nearest neighbor galaxy closer than the virial radius ( @xmath121 ) of the nearest neighbor galaxy and to change significantly at @xmath122 where the galaxies in pair start to merge .",
    "they interpreted this phenomenon as a result of hydrodynamic interactions within the virial radius of the galaxy plus dark halo system .",
    "the dependence of satellite properties as a function of the distance to the host galaxy in this study can be compared with the case of late - type neighbors in @xcite .",
    "since we restrict our analysis to the case of late - type host galaxy , it is expected that the sfa of both early- and late - type satellites increases as they approach the host .",
    "however , we found in ",
    "[ sfa ] that ( @xmath6 ) color becomes redder ( fig .",
    "[ fig - ur ] ) and @xmath123 ) hardly changes ( fig .",
    "[ fig - halpha ] ) even when late - type satellites approach their late - type hosts .",
    "this may be because , unlike the galaxies considered by @xcite , the satellites in this study are much fainter and less massive than their hosts . as a result they may not be able to pick up cold gas from their host much , and the enhancement of sfa through interactions with their host is counterbalanced by the quenching by the hot halo gas of the host .    on the other hand , the environment of satellite galaxies can be compared with that of galaxies in galaxy clusters because the member galaxies in a galaxy cluster are bounded within the gravitational potential well of the cluster as the satellites are bounded by their host galaxy .",
    "@xcite studied the dependence of galaxy properties on the clustercentric radius and the environment attributed to the nearest neighbor galaxy using the sdss galaxies associated with the abell galaxy clusters .",
    "they found that the sfa of late - type galaxies decreases as they approach the cluster center , and suggested that hydrodynamic interactions with nearby early - type galaxies in clusters is the main drive to quenching the sfa of late types .",
    "most cluster galaxies are early types including the brightest cluster galaxies ( or cd galaxies ) , which might be comparable with the case of early - type host galaxy in the satellite system as seen in figure [ fig - urearly ] .",
    "the late - type satellites ( bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig - urearly ] ) become redder as they approach early - type host galaxies , which agrees to the case of galaxy clusters .",
    "previously , @xcite pointed out that there are two distinct populations in the halo globular clusters in the milky way : old and young halo clusters .",
    "two populations were originally divided by the horizontal branch morphology , but were found to be also separated by their orbital motion in the milky way : prograde orbit for old halo clusters and retrograde orbit for young halo clusters @xcite . therefore , the formation history of old halo clusters with prograde orbit is thought to be different from that of young halo clusters with retrograde orbit ( e.g. , @xcite vs. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , it was suggested that the clusters in retrograde orbit may have been accreted into the milky way ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and further that these clusters and galactic dsphs may have the same origin in accretion or in partially disruption of formerly large parent satellite galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , two populations of satellite galaxies with different orbits in this study are also expected to have formed and evolved in different paths , which may be responsible for the different sfa depending on the orbit .",
    "the galactic satellite galaxies also can give us important clues for testing this scenario , but it is not achievable at this moment because of small number ( @xmath124 ) of galactic satellites whose orbital motion is determined .",
    "we have studied the orbital dependence of various galaxy properties in the satellite systems of galaxies in sdss .",
    "our primary results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we have found the satellite systems of galaxies at @xmath0 , which consist of 8904 satellites associated with 3515 isolated host galaxies .",
    "we have determined the spin direction of late - type host galaxies by inspecting the sdss color images . by combining our results with those from the previous spectroscopic observations in the literature",
    ", we obtained 635 satellites associated with 215 host galaxies whose spin directions are known .",
    "the number ratio of satellites in prograde orbit to those in retrograde orbit is nearly equal to one , and the peculiar velocity distribution is found to be symmetric .",
    "the number ratio of satellites in prograde orbit to those in retrograde orbit ( @xmath9 ) appears to increase as the projected distance to the host galaxy decreases .",
    "however , we do not find any significant difference in the azimuthal distribution of satellites between those in prograde and retrograde orbits .",
    "the satellites in retrograde orbit , on average , appear to be slightly brighter than those in prograde orbit .",
