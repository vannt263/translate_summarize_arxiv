    "the time - dependent quantum mechanics formalism has been extensively used in the recent years in several problems of physics and chemistry . since",
    "the work of mccullough and wyatt @xcite showing the interest of dealing directly with non - stationary states in calculating reactions probabilities , a consequent number of works has been devoted to the wave - packet dynamics .",
    "the reader could find the more recent developments in the reviews @xcite and references therein .    when solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation in a finite volume , one is faced with the problem of implementing the proper boundary conditions at finite distance .",
    "these boundary conditions are usually those of a free wave outgoing propagation . for the stationary solutions they are given by fixing the value of the logarithmic normal derivative on the boundaries of the interaction domain .",
    "however for the case of non - stationary wave packets a satisfactory solution is not known .    the usual way to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to impose the nullity of the wave on the boundaries and push them far enough to avoid the effect of parasite reflections in the region of interest @xcite .",
    "another way , widely used in other branches of physics and mechanics as well , is by means of the so - called absorbing boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "they indeed minimize parasit reflections but perturbe the dynamics near the boundary and do not provide a solution of the initial equation in its neighborhood .",
    "a third way is by the so called wave function splitting algorithm which consists in removing from the total wavefunction the part localized outside the interaction region before it reaches the boundary @xcite .",
    "other possibilities based on the interaction picture formalism have also been developed @xcite .",
    "although the above quoted methods provide a practical way to solve the problem they do not give a theoretical solution of it .",
    "the aim of this paper is to formulate an exact boundary condition ( ebc ) at finite distance for outgoing solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "consequently , it would allow a solution of time - dependent quantum mechanical problems in a finite spatial domain without any approximation in the boundaries .",
    "this theoretical result is completed by implementing the derived boundary conditions in some practical calculations concerning the more usual problems of the wavepacket dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we derive the general expression for the ebc which has to be imposed at the boundary of an arbitrary integration domain containing the interaction .",
    "this conditions turns to be non local on time and allows a solution limited to the interaction domain of the time - dependent schrdinger equation . in section 3",
    "the boundary conditions are reformulated for a discrete - time evolution problem in the frame of the crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the one dimensional schrdinger equation for which the use of these conditions is particularly simple .",
    "several illustrative examples are given in section 5 : the spreading of a free wave packet , the scattering of a wavepacket on a static potential , the behavior of an initially localized wave packet under a time - dependent perturbation .",
    "in the last example we derive explicit solutions of the schrdinger equation in a time - dependent delta potential .",
    "the applicability of the formulated conditions in a two - dimensional problem is shown in section 6 . a discussion on the interest and limitations of the ebc is finally presented in the conclusion .",
    "let us consider the dimensionless time - dependent schrdinger equation in a d - dimensional configuration space @xmath0\\psi(\\vec{x},t)=0\\ ] ] the potential @xmath1 , eventually time - dependent , is assumed to vanish outside a finite domain @xmath2 named the interaction domain .",
    "we wish to obtain a solution of ( [ cse ] ) by solving the equation in a finite spatial region @xmath3 , called hereafter the integration domain .",
    "the domain @xmath3 has to be chosen such that it contains @xmath2 , i.e. such that its complementary @xmath4 with respect to the total configuration space @xmath5 is free of interaction .",
    "we have thus @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the solution of ( [ cse ] ) in @xmath3 requires to formulate and implement the proper boundary conditions on its border , a surface @xmath8 . for this purpose",
    "let us first consider the solution @xmath9 of ( [ cse ] ) in @xmath4 .",
    "the domain @xmath4 is , by definition , free of interaction and @xmath9 satisfies the free schrdinger equation @xmath10 let @xmath11 be the free retarded propagator , i.e. a solution of @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 arbitrarily chosen .",
    "we have in mind the outgoing solution at @xmath14 of a time - dependent problem with initial value given by @xmath15 for @xmath16 . by multiplying equation ( [ fcse ] ) by @xmath17 , equation ( [ 112 ] ) by @xmath9 and substracting",
    "one gets the relation @xmath18\\cr & -&\\nabla_{\\vec{x}}\\cdot\\left[i\\psi(\\vec{x},t)\\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{\\nabla}_{\\vec{x } }   k_0^{+}(\\vec{x}_0-\\vec{x},t_0-t)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 .",
    "this relation is to be integrated over the @xmath20 dimensional space - time volume @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "we will assume that the domain @xmath4 is connected .",
    "this assumption is justified for most of the cases except for @xmath22 , which will be discussed later .",
    "the integral of the right hand side is then transformed , by using the green theorem , into a flux term through the boundary surface @xmath8 .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the normal to @xmath8 pointing towards @xmath4 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .    taking into account that @xmath24 for t@xmath25 and that there is no contribution from the flux at the infinity for purely outgoing waves ( for they have the same asymptotic behavior as the retarded free propagator ) we obtain the following relations depending on the relative position of @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27 one has @xmath28 the solution in the free region is thus obtained as a sum of a first term , representing the free propagation of the wave which was initially in the non interacting region @xmath4 , and a second term made only with the values of the wavefunction and its normal derivative at the boundary @xmath8 at the past times . equation ( [ bcde ] ) can be consequently used to propagate outside @xmath3 a solution obtained in @xmath3 and can be viewed as a generalization of the huyghens principle in a space - time surface .    if @xmath29 one has @xmath30 this result can be obtained either as a limiting case of the preceding one ( [ bcde ] ) or by directly integrating equation ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath29 .",
    "equation ( [ bcds ] ) is the boundary condition we were looking for .",
    "it provides an integral relation between the value of the wavefunction on a point of @xmath8 at a given time and the values of the wavefunction and their derivatives in @xmath8 at the preceding times .",
    "starting from a known initial state at time @xmath31 , equation ( [ bcds ] ) gives in its differential form the boundary condition on @xmath8 required for determining at time @xmath32 the solution of the time - dependent schrodinger equation in the finite domain @xmath3 .",
    "several comments are in order :    * the relation ( [ bcds ] ) is non local in both space and time .",
    "it generalizes the outgoing boundary condition for the monochromatic free plane waves , which in the one - dimensional case and at @xmath33 reads : @xmath34 * the choice of @xmath11 ensures that only free outgoing waves will propagate across @xmath8 , in the same way as a solution obtained in an infinite domain .",
    "this result is exact and consequently will not generate any reflection on the boundary . *",
    "the first term of its right hand side corresponds to the free propagation of the initial state which was initially in the external region @xmath4 .",
    "its numerical calculation needs some care due to the oscillatory character of the propagator and several ways to overcome it are proposed below : * * it is always possible to eliminate this contribution by choosing the initial time @xmath31 and @xmath3 in such a way that the initial state is fully in @xmath3 . * * in the case when the initial state is very extended , it is more suitable to include it entirely in @xmath4 . indeed",
    "the volume integral term gives then the value at the boundary of a free evolution of the initial state .",
    "this can be easily calculated in the momentum space and is known analytically for some cases of physical interest like gaussian wavepackets . * * in the case when the initial state is entirely in @xmath4 , there exists another possibility to remove the volume term by splitting the solution into its non perturbed and scattered parts , i.e. @xmath35 in which @xmath36 is the solution of ( [ fcse ] ) which coincides at @xmath37 with the initial state and @xmath38 a solution of the inhomogeneous equation @xmath39\\chi(\\vec{x},t)=v(\\vec{x},t)\\phi(\\vec{x},t)\\ ] ] the unknown function @xmath38 vanishes at @xmath37 and satisfies in the free domain @xmath4 the same equations than @xmath9 .",
    "it will consequently satisfy on @xmath8 the boundary conditions ( [ bcds ] ) without the volume term .",
    "the preceding relations , completed by the case @xmath40 , are summarized in the following equation @xmath41 with @xmath42 defined by @xmath43    the above derivation has been done under the assumption that the potential @xmath1 vanishes outside a finite domain @xmath2 .",
    "this condition can be however weakened in some cases .",
    "for instance in the case of an interaction made of one short range part @xmath44 plus a static long range part @xmath45 ( e.g. coulomb , polarisation or centrifugal potentials ) the same derivation holds . the interaction domain",
    "is then defined by @xmath44 whereas @xmath4 can contain @xmath45 all across .",
    "the only difference in equation ( [ obc ] ) consists in replacing the free propagator @xmath11 by the corresponding propagator of the long range potential @xmath45 .    in the one dimensional case",
    "the interaction domain is @xmath46 $ ] and the free exterior domains @xmath4 has two connected components @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ obc ] ) , based on the green theorem , has to be applied to each of them .",
    "let us take for instance @xmath49 $ ] . at @xmath50 , the normal derivative of the free propagator on the boundary vanishes , as it can be explicitely checked on its expression ( @xmath51 ) : @xmath52",
    "the ebc ( [ bcds ] ) becomes simply @xmath53    it is worth noticing that in case @xmath54 this result may be obtained in a quite straightforward way .",
    "indeed let us consider the fourier energy components of the wavefunction @xmath55 and let us impose to each of them the plane wave outgoing boundary condition ( [ bcpw1d ] ) on the form @xmath56 inserting this relation in ( [ obc2 ] ) one gets @xmath57 we recognize the fourier transform of the free green function for zero argument @xmath58 and we obtain the following relation : @xmath59 in agreement with the second term in the right hand side of ( [ obc1 ] ) .",
    "the first term does not contribute in the limit @xmath60 due to the fact that the free propagator tends to zero .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ obc ] ) generalizes the kkr @xcite method which provides a relation between the solution and its normal derivative at the boundary of a free domain .",
    "this method has been derived and successfully applied in the case of static quantum billards .",
    "the formulation we have developed in this section appears as a natural extension of this method for space - time billards .    the condition ( [ obc ] ) is not directly useful in a numerical solution of the problem .",
    "indeed the singularity of the propagator at @xmath61 would generate instabilities when the dependent schrdinger equation is discretized . to overcome this difficulty one has to reformulate the boundary conditions in the particular approximate scheme chosen .",
    "the aim of the following section is to obtain such a formulation in the frame of the crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "the cranck - nicholson @xcite method for solving a discrete - time evolution problem consists in approximating the infinitesimal evolution operator @xmath62 by the expression : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the wavefunctions at two consecutive times separated by @xmath66 and the hamiltonian h is evaluated at the mean time @xmath67 .    by introducing the imaginary parameter @xmath68 , equation ( [ cn1 ] )",
    "can be rewritten in the form @xmath69 according to what the solution at time - step m is obtained by solving an inhomogeneous stationary schrdinger equation with complex energy @xmath70 .",
    "the source term is provided by the solution at the preceding time .    by means of ( [ dse ] )",
    "the equivalent of equation ( [ fcse ] ) for the outgoing wavefunction in the free domain @xmath4 becomes @xmath71 and the discrete free retarded propagator @xmath72 is defined as the solution of @xmath73 normalised to @xmath74    for @xmath75 one obtains the analogous to the continuum case by simply replacing the time integral by a sum over the discrete index p @xmath76\\vec{n}ds \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in calculating the limit @xmath77 and like in the continuum case there is a singularity in the normal derivative of the free propagator .",
    "its contribution to the surface term in the r.h.s of ( [ cn5 ] ) is @xmath78 for @xmath79 and the opposite for @xmath80",
    ". the volume contribution can be in its turn re - written by means of the regularized propagator @xmath81 defined as @xmath82 and one finally arrives to @xmath83\\vec{n}ds \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression is the equivalent of ( [ bcds ] ) for the discrete time evolution .    to make use of the discrete ebc condition ( [ dobc ] ) it remains to derive an expression for the discrete - time free propagator @xmath84 . in the momentum space equation ( [ cn3 ] ) reads as @xmath85 which leads to : @xmath86 one can see in equation ( [ as ] ) that in the limit @xmath87 the fourier transform of the propagator contains the singular delta function manifested in ( [ propa ] ) .",
    "nevertheless this term cancels in the sum of two successive propagators .",
    "this sum is given by the non singular integral : @xmath88    this integral can in principle be calculated by the contour cauchy method .",
    "however , its value can also be obtained by means of the discrete fourier tranform .",
    "we note indeed that a n discrete - time fourier transfom with respect to the index p of equation ( [ k+k ] ) gives the sum of a geometric series . with the inverse fourier",
    "transform we obtain : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the required convergence factor of the geometric series which has to be chosen such that @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 is the standard free green function with energy @xmath94 .",
    "although the formalism has been developed in view of solving the schrodinger equation in a finite domain @xmath3 , equation ( [ cn5 ] ) with @xmath95 provides the wavefunction in all the configuration space .",
    "however one can obtain a closed form for some observables in terms of the internal solution only .",
    "let us consider for example the overlapping between two outgoing solutions @xmath36 et @xmath9 of ( [ fdse ] ) in the exterior domain .",
    "standard algebra gives for the exterior part of the integral the expression @xmath96 which can be calculated from the solution in @xmath3 . by adding the corresponding equations for consecutive time steps one obtains the desirate scalar product .",
    "this expression is used e.g. in calculating the auto - correlation function ( see section [ delta ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath97 provides the rate of variation of the probability in the exterior domain by time step .",
    "the contribution from @xmath3 can be calculated by numerical integration and we thus have the possibility to verify the conservation of the total norm .    in summary the solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation in the interaction domain @xmath3 can be obtained by solving , at each time step , a stationary complex and inhomogeneous schrdinger equation ( [ cn1 ] ) in @xmath3 with the boundary conditions given by ( [ dobc ] ) .",
    "the local character of this equation is preserved by these conditions .",
    "we are thus let with the solution of a banded linear system , whatever the discretisation algorithm used for the spatial variables . for static hamiltonians",
    "this linear system is in addition the same at any time - step .",
    "in the one dimensional problems , simplifications arise . like in the continuum case , the normal derivatives of the propagator at the boundaries vanish .",
    "the sum of two successive propagators for @xmath50 can be explicitly calculated and gives : @xmath98 this integral can be performed by standard methods : it vanishes for odd values of p and for @xmath99 it gives @xmath100 with @xmath101 the boundary conditions ( [ dobc ] ) give at @xmath50 : @xmath102}c_q\\partial_x\\left[\\psi_{n-2q}(a)+\\psi_{n-2q-1 } ( a)\\right]\\ ] ] at @xmath103 one obtains in a similar way @xmath104}c_q\\partial_x\\left[\\psi_{n-2q}(-a)+\\psi_{n-2q-1}(-a)\\right]\\ ] ]    for illustration we have detailed some simple examples concerning the time evolution of wavepackets .",
    "the initial state has been taken for simplicity of gaussian form @xmath105    the examples have been solved by scaling the integration domain @xmath3 to the interval @xmath106 $ ] .",

    "the required @xmath107 equations are obtained by validating ( [ cn1 ] ) at each grid point .",
    "however to evaluate the second derivative at the end of the grid the values of the wave function at the nearest points exterior of this domain is needed .",
    "these are written in terms of the internal points by using ebc conditions ( [ c1d],[c1 g ] ) with a symmetric formula to evaluate the derivative term . substituting this exterior values in ( [ cn1 ] ) we end with a tridiagonal linear system of dimension @xmath107 .",
    "the first example concerns the free propagation of a gaussian wave - packet .",
    "its main interest lies in the fact that an analytical solution is known which allows to check the validity of our boundary conditions . in this case",
    "the integration domain is not fixed by the interaction but chosen such that it fully contains the initial wavepacket .",

    "the parameters chosen in this simple example may serve to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of this method .    in the example",
    "considered above and due to the value of @xmath120 , the probability flux leaves the interaction domain mostly at @xmath122 .",
    "however , due to the spreading of the wavepacket , the wave function at @xmath123 is also being populated although its value remains very small and is not visible in the figure . by taking v=0",
    "one has a symmetric situation for which the same quality of results has been obtained .",

    "they result in solving at each discrete time step a stationary schrdinger equation with complex energy in a finite spatial domain .",
    "the local character of this equation is preserved by the boundary conditions and we are thus let with a band matrix problem whatever the discretisation algorithm used .",
    "the economy resulting when solving the problem in a reduced spatial domain allows to considerably increase the number of grid points and to use for a same accuracy less powerful but simpler algorithms .",
    "the numerical results obtained with the cranck nicholson scheme are found to be very satisfactory . other time and space discretisation algorithms",
    "can however be used as well at the cost of the simplicity .",
    "the derived boundary conditions can be applied to more general situations than those considered in the examples .",
    "the case of higher dimensionality and/or of coupled equations , for instance , can be treated without modifying the formalism .",
    "a numerical application of the free evolution of a two - dimensional gaussian wave packet is given .",
    "long range static potentials may be taken into account as far as an analytic solution is known for the corresponding propagators .",
    "the generalization to the time - dependent treatment of the three body problem is straightforward and could be of some interest in some molecular physics problems @xcite or a doorway to solve the still open question of coulomb problem above threshold .",
    "the interest in formulating exact boundary conditions at finite distance for time - dependent problems recently appeared in the field of statistical mechanics and conclusions similar to those presented in this work have been reached in @xcite .",
    "but this formulation is also relevant in other branches of physics than those governed by the schrdinger equation . in particular for the diffusion equation , for which the same results hold with imaginary time .",
    "the case of hyperbolic equation of interest in many fields of physics can be treated in the same footing @xcite .",
