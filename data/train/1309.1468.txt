    "beyond the black - hole / accretion disk structure that forms the heart of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and produces the thermal continuum spectrum , the standard paradigm to explain the ultraviolet through infrared spectra of agns features two distinct emission - line regions : a broad - line region ( blr ) , which consists of relatively dense clouds , filaments , or streams of gas deep in the gravitational potential well of the central black hole , and a lower - density , more spatially extended narrow - line region ( nlr ) that gives rise to the forbidden lines ( e.g. , [ oiii]@xmath3 , 5007 ) and the narrow cores of the permitted lines .",
    "the size of the blr , @xmath4 , is measured by reverberation mapping @xcite and is found to be dependent on the luminosity of the agn ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) roughly as expected from photoionization theory .",
    "recent results using microlensing in gravitationally lensed quasars , while less developed , provide an independent confirmation of this picture ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in local seyfert galaxies ,",
    "the size of the blr is typically light days to light weeks ; even in the nearest agns , the blr projects to only tens of microarcseconds , so it is currently resolvable only by reverberation mapping or microlensing .",
    "the nlr , by contrast , is sometimes large enough to be partially resolved on the sky and often shows a clear biconical structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the reverberation mapping technique relies on the intrinsic variability of the agn continuum and the response of the broad emission lines to these variations , delayed on average by the light - travel time across the blr , @xmath5 .",
    "the continuum and emission - line flux variations are not extremely large ( @xmath620% on broad - line reverberation timescales ) so the reverberation technique requires quite precise spectrophotometric flux measurements , typically at the 12% level @xcite , to be successful .",
    "unfortunately , even under excellent observing conditions , it is difficult to perform ground - based optical absolute spectrophotometry to better than @xmath7 accuracy , so non - standard techniques must be employed to obtain higher internal precision .",
    "it is only necessary to have accurate _ relative _ flux calibration between epochs , and there are two standard strategies for doing so .",
    "the first strategy is to align the spectrograph slit so as to simultaneously record the spectra of the targeted agn and a nearby non - variable star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the second , more commonly used method is to assume that the flux in the forbidden [ oiii]@xmath8 , 5007 lines is constant on reverberation time scales and therefore can be used as an internal flux calibration standard @xcite .",
    "the assumption that narrow - line fluxes are constant over reverberation timescales is justified by the spatial extent of the nlr . for case",
    "b recombination , the size of the nlr is of order @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the luminosity of the h@xmath2 narrow component in units of @xmath11ergss@xmath12 , @xmath13 is the electron density in units of @xmath14@xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the volume filling factor of the narrow - line gas @xcite .",
    "in addition to the large light - travel time across the nlr , the low particle density means that the recombination time is also long , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hydrogen case b recombination coefficient and has a value of @xmath19 at @xmath20k @xcite .",
    "this effectively damps out any short timescale flux variations .",
    "the luminosity of the h@xmath2  narrow component in ngc 5548 @xmath21 , heliocentric ) is @xmath22ergs  s@xmath12 ( including a correction for galactic absorption corresponding to @xmath23mag ) , and nlr electron densities are typically @xmath24 @xcite , so for ngc 5548 , we expect @xmath25years and @xmath26years .    there are , however , only a small number of agns that have been spectroscopically monitored on timescales much longer than blr reverberation timescales . in this regard ,",
    "the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548 is a special case .",
    "it has been the subject of a number of spectroscopic monitoring programs , motivated at least in part by the desire to have a long time - series on at least one fairly typical intermediate luminosity agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; the optical spectroscopic coverage now extends over 40 years . a long baseline that includes multiple reverberation campaigns allows us , for example , to test the repeatability of black hole mass measurements as the blr radius and emission - line profile can change on dynamical timescales ( @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the broad line width ) due to large - scale secular luminosity variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are potentially related to accretion - rate changes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "absolute calibration of the thousands of optical spectra of ngc 5548 that have been obtained over recent decades has been tied to a fairly homogeneous subset of spectra that were obtained under photometric conditions during the first year of the 13-year international agn watch monitoring campaign on this source in 198889 @xcite .",
    "based on these observations , a flux of @xmath29}\\,\\lambda5007 ) =   5.58 \\times 10^{-13}$ ] ergss@xmath12@xmath30 was adopted , and all subsequent spectra were scaled to this value . for the first seven years of this campaign ,",
    "[ oiii]@xmath31 fluxes were measured in a similar high - quality subset of the spectra @xcite and were found to be consistent with this value to within the measurement errors , which are estimated to be @xmath32 ( see  [ sec : data ] ) , assuming that there is no real variability on time scales shorter than a few weeks .    in recent months , we have revisited the issue of absolute flux calibration of the ngc5548 spectra motivated by identification of some apparent inconsistencies between recent and previously published measurements @xcite and by the detection of strong long timescale narrow - line flux variability in another agn in our monitoring program @xcite . here",
    "we describe the results of this re - investigation , which reveals narrow - line flux variations on timescales short enough to allow determination of the size of the nlr .",
    "we discuss the data and measurements in  2 .",
    "we discuss our recalibration of the historical light curve for ngc 5548 in  3 and the implications for the nlr in  4 .",
    "we use measurements of the absolute flux of the [ oiii]@xmath31 emission line from high - quality ccd spectra that were obtained through wide entrance apertures to mitigate seeing effects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and under weather conditions that were recorded by the observer on site to be either `` clear '' or `` photometric . ''",
    "in each case , the observing conditions are a judgment call , though the observers appeared to be quite conservative in declaring weather conditions to be sufficiently good that absolute spectrophotometry was possible . for the first 7 years of the international agn watch campaign ( 198889 to 199495 ) ,",
    "we used published [ oiii]@xmath31 emission - line fluxes @xcite .",
    "new measurements were made from international agn watch data from years 8 through 13 @xcite .",
    "these measurements are given in table 1 .",
    "in addition to the international agn watch data , we employed data from more recent monitoring campaigns that were undertaken by our group in cooperation with others .",
    "we refer to these data sets by the internal campaign names we used at mdm observatory : agn05 over 2005 march ",
    "april @xcite , agn07 over 2007 march  august @xcite , and agn12 over 2012 january ",
    "april @xcite .",
    "we also used data from a campaign undertaken by the lick agn monitoring program from 2008 february  may ( lamp08 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we again selected a subset of spectra for which the observer noted that the weather conditions were good .",
    "measurements from all of these spectra are given in table 2 .    to estimate the uncertainty in each of the flux measurements in tables 1 and 2",
    ", we assumed that the fractional uncertainty is constant for each set and that there is no true flux variability on the short timescales .",
    "we then compared flux differences between all pairs of measurements separated by no more than 10 to 20 days , depending on how many pairs were available , and assumed that variations on these timescales are due only to measurement errors .",
    "the fractional uncertainties we adopted are thus 0.044 for the international agn watch data , 0.040 for agn05 , 0.065 for agn07 , 0.055 for lamp08 , and 0.028 for agn12 .    as noted in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , there are good reasons to believe that the narrow - line flux should be non - variable on reverberation timescales .",
    "moreover , we do not see any trend in the [ oiii ] fluxes within the individual data sets that each span less than a year .",
    "we therefore average the flux measurements for each individual data set , and these values are given in table 3 .",
    "we show these average [ oiii]@xmath31 fluxes as function of julian date in figure 1 ( bottom ) , along with the 5100  continuum flux ( top ) .",
    "there is a clearly significant long - term downward trend in the [ oiii]@xmath31 flux as a function of time , that seems to bottom out and perhaps reverse in the more recent campaigns .    in order to measure directly the size of the [ oiii]-emitting region and to measure accurately the width of the [ oiii ] lines in a high - resolution spectrum",
    ", we also retrieved images taken with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) from the mikulsky archive for space telescopes ; @xcite have previously characterized the [ oiii]-emitting region of ngc 5548 as `` compact , '' based on these data .",
    "figure 1 shows that our previous assumption that a single fixed value of the [ oiii]@xmath31 emission - line flux can serve as the absolute calibration for all ngc 5548 spectra over long timescales is incorrect .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath31 emission - line flux varies significantly on timescales as short as a few years .",
    "it is therefore necessary to recalibrate the published 5100  optical continuum and broad h@xmath2 emission - line fluxes , correcting for the slow variations of the [ oiii]@xmath31 flux .",
    "the flux correction factors that need to be employed are given in table 3 .",
    "we chose to use average values rather than to fit a smooth continuous function of time to all the data because the differences in the correction factors between closely spaced campaigns are very small and because we observed no trends within the individual campaigns .",
    "if we want to place the entire 5100  continuum light curve on a single flux scale , we must also take into account the different amounts of host - galaxy starlight contamination in each data set on account of the different spectrograph entrance apertures employed in the different observing campaigns .",
    "it should be noted that the international agn watch data sets have all been adjusted relative to a fixed entrance aperture of @xmath33 . in table 4",
    ", we give the host - galaxy fluxes through the various spectrograph entrance apertures employed in these campaigns based on modeling the _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) images of the host galaxy @xcite .    for each campaign ,",
    "we multiply the published 5100optical continuum light curve by the appropriate correction factor in table 3 and then subtract the appropriate host galaxy flux listed in table 4 .",
    "the resulting host - corrected light curve is shown in the top panel of figure 2 and presented in table [ table : continuum ] .",
    "we also recalibrate the long - term emission - line light curve by multiplying the measurements from each data set by the flux correction factor from table 3 .",
    "we have previously determined from low - state spectra obtained in years 2 , 4 , 9 , 12 and 13 that the flux ratio of narrow h@xmath2  to [ oiii]@xmath31 is constant and has a value of 0.11 @xcite .",
    "this ratio is also the same in spectra from agn05 and agn07 , so we conclude that narrow h@xmath2  is also slowly varying .",
    "we therefore subtract off the narrow h@xmath2  flux from the total h@xmath2  flux , leaving behind the isolated broad component of h@xmath2 ; this is the light curve shown in the lower panel of figure 2 and presented in table [ table : hbeta ] .",
    "we note in passing that the flux ratio [ oiii]@xmath31/[oiii]@xmath34 is fixed at 2.94 as both lines arise out of the same upper state ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the recalibrated fluxes , particularly those obtained in low states , expose some of the limitations of the simple spectral analysis employed here .",
    "the simple prescription used for the h@xmath2 flux measurement ( figure 1 of * ? ? ? * ) was intended to capture most of the h@xmath2  variations rather than accurate isolate the h@xmath2  broad - line flux .",
    "for example , according to table 6 , the broad h@xmath2  flux reaches zero during the agn07 campaign ( at jd2454251 ) , within the uncertainty of @xmath36ergss@xmath12@xmath30 .",
    "however , inspection of the original spectrum reveals a clear , but very weak broad component blended with other weak features .",
    "measurement of very weak broad - line fluxes can be done accurately only by employing detailed decomposition and modeling of the individual spectra , which is work in progress .",
    "as with the broad lines , the narrow - line light curve should be a shifted and smoothed version of the continuum driving the ionization .",
    "the temporal span of our light curves is too short to measure directly the lag between the continuum and the narrow - line fluxes .",
    "however , we can statistically estimate the timescale over which the continuum light curve must be smoothed in order to reproduce the narrow - line light curve .",
    "this timescale is roughly equal to the sum of the temporal smoothing created by the light travel time across the narrow line region and the recombination time scale from equation  2 , @xmath37 where we characterize the nlr as a sphere of radius @xmath38 .",
    "we first need a statistical model for the continuum variability .",
    "we obtain this by fitting a damped random walk ( drw ) stochastic process model to the h@xmath2 light curve .",
    "the drw model is known to well reproduce the variability of quasars @xcite .",
    "the optical continuum light curve in the most recent campaigns approaches zero flux in large part because of how the fluxes were measured , so we only fit the pre-2003 agn watch data . in any case",
    ", the large multi - year gaps in the later data would result in only weak constraints on the final model fit .",
    "we fit the light curve mean and the drw time scale @xmath39 and amplitude @xmath40 using the procedures of @xcite with monte carlo markov chains ( mcmc ) to estimate the uncertainties .",
    "fits to the pseudo - magnitude @xmath41 ( i.e. , fractional variations in flux ) had far higher maximum likelihoods than fits to the flux , so we only report those results , finding @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 with 90% confidence ranges of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath39 is in days and the fluxes in @xmath40 and @xmath48 were normalized by @xmath49  ergs@xmath12  @xmath30  @xmath12 .",
    "we drew model light curves from these mcmc chains , boxcar smoothed them on timescale @xmath50 and fit them to the seasonally averaged narrow - line light curve with a @xmath51 statistic . for the fit",
    ", we allowed a multiplicative scaling between the model of the smoothed continuum and the narrow - line data , needed for unit conversion , but no temporal shifts .",
    "we assigned the narrow - line data the epoch of the midpoint of the monitoring campaign . for each choice of @xmath50 , we made @xmath52 trials and then constructed a bayesian estimate of @xmath53 with a logarithmic prior by weighting each trial as @xmath54 , summing over all the trials and normalizing the final distribution to unity .",
    "the resulting differential @xmath53 and integral @xmath55 are shown in figure  [ fig : tsmooth ] .",
    "the median value is @xmath56  years and the 90% confidence range is @xmath57 to @xmath58  years . the narrow - line light curve is already smoothed over each season , with an average length of @xmath59  years .",
    "we can roughly correct for this by adding the length of the average season to @xmath50 , so we adopt as our final estimate @xmath60  years with a 90% confidence interval of @xmath61 to @xmath62  years .",
    "figure  [ fig : constrain ] shows the constraint this estimate of @xmath50 places on the size @xmath38 of the emission region and the typical density @xmath63 . for high densities",
    ", @xmath50 simply becomes the light - crossing time @xmath64 of the nlr , and the density is required to be @xmath65  @xmath15 to keep @xmath66 .",
    "we also show the critical density for the [ oiii]@xmath31 transition ( @xmath67  @xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and lines of constant h@xmath2 luminosity @xmath68  ergss@xmath12 with a filling factor of @xmath69 and @xmath70 , following equation  1 .",
    "@xcite estimate that the mass of the black hole in ngc 5548 is @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite measure the bulge velocity dispersion to be @xmath72kms@xmath12 which together yield a black hole radius of influence @xmath73 9 pc .",
    "since this is larger than the estimated nlr radius , the [ oiii ] line width of @xmath74kms@xmath12 ( see below ) should be dominated by the gravity of the black hole , with @xmath75 .",
    "this leads to a kinematic estimate of the size of the nlr @xmath76pc which is in excellent agreement with all our other estimates , as shown in figure [ fig : constrain ] .",
    "it is also noteworthy that this measurement is in excellent agreement with the size of the high - ionization component of the nlr predicted by photoionization equilibrium modeling @xcite .",
    "the compactness of the [ oiii]-emitting nlr is surprising given earlier narrow - band imaging that indicated kpc - scale extended structure @xcite .",
    "our own fabry ",
    "perot [ oiii]@xmath31 images of ngc 5548 @xcite favor a compact nlr , but these images were obtained under poor seeing ( @xmath77 ) conditions .",
    "we therefore inspected archival stis images , as described in  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the [ oiii ] lines extracted from these data are shown in figure [ fig : stis ] . the width of the lines is @xmath78 . in the spatial direction",
    ", we find that 94% of the [ oiii ] emission is concentrated in a 2.42 pixel gaussian core .",
    "a tinytim @xcite model of the point - spread function for stis imaging at the observed wavelength of [ oiii]@xmath31 has a width @xmath79 pixels . subtracting this in quadrature from the best - fit gaussian to the [ oiii ]",
    "emission gives the intrinsic width of the [ oiii]-emitting region of 2 pixels or 0.102 arcsec or 37pc .",
    "this means that @xmath80% of the [ oiii ] emission arises within a region of @xmath81pc , consistent with the results above .",
    "flux variability and _ hst _ imaging both suggest that the [ oiii]-emitting region is much smaller than previously supposed , 13pc rather than kpc - scale",
    ". the actual physical extent of the nlr may be somewhat larger than the estimates given here if it is elongated along the line of sight and if , on account of obscuration , we preferentially detect emission from the narrow line - emitting gas on the near side .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath82 5007 profiles shown in figure [ fig : stis ] support such a scenario : the lines are distinctly asymmetric , with @xmath83 . such blueward asymmetries are often assumed to indicate that the nlr has an outflowing component ( e.g. , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which modern spatially resolved studies have confirmed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but the outflow velocities in any case are not terribly different from the virial velocity and none of our conclusions about the compactness of the nlr would be significantly altered if the nlr has an outflowing component .",
    "in addition to being compact , we also infer that the particle density in the [ oiii]-emitting region is higher than previously supposed .",
    "this seems to be consistent with other observations : it is well known that the widths of the narrow lines in seyfert 2 galaxies correlate with both critical density and ionization potential @xcite .",
    "presumably , the higher velocity gas is closer to the central source , so we can explain this as a consequence of ionization stratification . from the [ oiii ] flux variations , we infer that the electron density is @xmath84@xmath15 , close to the critical density .",
    "we suspect that this is also true for the nlr in other agns and there have simply not been enough high - quality spectrophotometric observations over a sufficiently long timescale for narrow - line variability to have been reliably detected in many cases .",
    "indeed , we have found only one other credible report in the refereed literature of narrow emission - line flux variability , the case of 3c390.3 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a systematic search of long - term changes in nlr fluxes would be rewarding and that , in principle , the time variability of the nlr would provide an independent check of black hole mass estimates from reverberation mapping of the blr .",
    "the narrow - line flux variations that we report on here do not negate any of the conclusions to date that have been drawn from reverberation mapping studies .",
    "the narrow - line fluxes are still effectively constant on timescales much longer than reverberation timescales . indeed ,",
    "if the narrow - line gas is virialized , as the broad - line gas seems to be , then @xmath85/\\delta v [ { \\rm narrow}])^2 $ ] , which is of order 100 .",
    "these results do , however , show that absolute calibration of the narrow - line fluxes requires attention .",
