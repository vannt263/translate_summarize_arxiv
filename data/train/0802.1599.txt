    "in this paper i examine the experimentally testable consequences of the hypothesis that newton s second law should be changed for small accelerations .",
    "this hypothesis - called the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) with modified inertia - has been proposed by milgrom @xcite as an alternative to the more conventional dark matter explanation of the shape of the galactic rotation curves .",
    "the main assumption of the modified - inertia mond is that newton s second law should be modified to read @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a fundamental acceleration of the order of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a function satisfying the two conditions : @xmath5 at @xmath6 and @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "( more details about @xmath4 and @xmath2 are in sec .",
    "v and vi . )",
    "further , the universal gravitation law is assumed to keep its conventional form @xmath9    at this stage , the modified - inertia mond is only formulated in the context of newtonian physics , i.e. , a flat - space picture , which will be assumed throughout this paper .    at the moment the mond approach is attracting constantly growing interest .",
    "various astrophysical aspects of this approach are under active discussion ( see @xcite and the last ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive bibliography ) . however , until lately the analysis of terrestrial ( as opposed to astrophysical ) consequences of mond has been missing in the literature .",
    "the unusual smallness of the acceleration @xmath2 makes it very difficult to think of a laboratory test .",
    "it also explains why we do not see any deviations from newton s second law under ordinary circumstances .",
    "surprising first results of such analysis have recently been described in @xcite .",
    "one of these results is the existence of a new effect that has been called static high - latitude equinox modified inertia or shlem : around each equinox date , 2 spots emerge on the earth where static bodies experience spontaneous displacement due to the violation of newton s second law required by the modified - inertia mond .",
    "the laboratory observation of this effect may be accessible to current experimental capabilities .",
    "consequently , it could serve as a basis for a proposal to test the validity of newton s second law for small accelerations in a laboratory based experiment ",
    "the first of its kind .",
    "in fact , such a test could become a crucial experiment in view of the lack of conclusive astrophysical evidence either in favour or against the modified newtonian dynamics .    here , a detailed theory of this effect is developed and estimates of the magnitude of the signal due to the effect are obtained .",
    "the expected displacement of a mirror in a gravitational wave interferometer is found to be about @xmath0 m.    the nature of inertia has long been one of the most fundamental puzzles of physics . in recent times , this puzzle has widened to include also the problem of the origin of mass in the standard model . despite concerted theoretical efforts over decades ,",
    "the path to the solution is still to be found .",
    "thus the pursuit of mond as an alternative explanation of the ` dark matter ' puzzle seems well motivated .",
    "if true , it will bring about the need to revise foundations of modern physics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . to make the exposition more understandable and self - contained , sections ii and iii review and",
    "extend the background material from @xcite .",
    "section iv describes the shlem effect qualitatively . in sec .",
    "v and vi the equation of motion is derived and its solution is obtained . in sec .",
    "vii some experimental suggestions are discussed .",
    "finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "first i emphasize that to obtain laboratory - testable predictions , mond needs to be formulated not only in inertial reference systems , but also in non - inertial systems as well @xcite .",
    "( in the mond context all laboratory reference systems should be considered as non - inertial . )",
    "because the dynamical law is modified depending on the acceleration , the transition between inertial and non - inertial systems in mond becomes less straightforward than in the conventional mechanics .    of particular interest",
    "are transformation properties of @xmath2 .",
    "logically , at least 2 options could be imagined .",
    "first , one can assume that the fundamental acceleration that determines the onset of the mond regime equals @xmath2 only in the inertial reference systems .",
    "second , it could be assumed that @xmath2 is invariant under transformations from inertial to non - inertial systems .",
    "one would expect that these 2 types of theories would lead to drastically different experimental predictions .",
    "for instance , the first type of theory requires that the mond regime is reached as soon as the test body moves with a tiny acceleration @xmath10 _ _ with respect to the galactic reference frame__. for example , the acceleration due to the andromeda galaxy is less than @xmath11 . ] .    on the other hand",
    ", the second type of theory implies that in order to reach the mond regime , we should try to ensure that the test body moves with a tiny acceleration @xmath10 _ with respect to the laboratory reference frame_.    however , it has been pointed out that the second version ( invariant acceleration @xmath2 ) is not self - consistent @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the invariance of @xmath2 is inconsistent with the kinematical rules of acceleration addition .",
    "indeed , let us take two reference frames : an inertial s , and a non - inertial s@xmath12 that is in translational motion with acceleration @xmath13 relative to s. then , in the system s the equation of motion will be @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the acceleration of a test body in the system s. if we assume that @xmath2 is invariant , then the equation of motion in the system s@xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the acceleration of the test body in the system s@xmath12 .",
    "however , equations ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) can not hold simultaneously for all @xmath15 and @xmath19 : for instance , if we put @xmath20 then we obtain @xmath21 for all @xmath19 which means that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 . thus the invariant-@xmath2 version of mond is inconsistent .",
    "in addition , this version has been ruled out experimentally @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "only the first version will be considered .",
    "we will now recall what conditions must be realized in order to obtain the shlem effect for test bodies at rest in the ground - based laboratory @xcite .",
    "this question is easy to answer in the inertial system @xmath24 .",
    "( it is the system with the origin in the centre - of - mass of our galaxy and the axes pointing to certain far - away quasars ) . in this system",
    ", we should ensure that the test body moves with a tiny acceleration @xmath25 with respect to @xmath24 : @xmath26 in this section , the @xmath27 sign will mean that the difference between the left - hand side and the right - hand side of an equation is much less than the characteristic mond acceleration @xmath2 .",
    "next , we are going to the laboratory system with the help of @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the acceleration of the earth s centre with respect to the heliocentric reference frame , @xmath30 is the angular velocity of the earth s rotation , @xmath31 is the sun s acceleration with respect to @xmath24 ; @xmath32 is the position of the test body with respect to the laboratory reference frame ; @xmath33 is the position vector of the origin of the lab frame with respect to the terrestrial frame with the origin at the earth s centre .",
    "a number of terms have not been written out in eq .",
    "( [ 0a ] ) on account of their smallness .",
    "they include terms due to : the coriolis acceleration of the sun , the length - of - day ( lod ) variation , precession and nutation of the earth s rotation axis , polar motion and chandler s wobble ( see table 1 for their approximate magnitudes ) .",
    ".accelerations that can be ignored . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the account of lunar perturbation can significantly change the longitude , but the latitude prediction is much more robust : it would not change by more than @xmath34 , or @xmath35 .",
    "the signature of the shlem effect would be a spontaneous displacement of the test body occurring around the instant @xmath36 defined by eq .",
    "( [ 55 ] ) , and we are now ready to start calculating its magnitude .",
    "the qualitative scenario runs as follows : around the instant @xmath36 the test body and the reference body move according to two different laws of motion . roughly speaking",
    ", mond makes the test body to ` lose ' its mass while the the reference body keeps its normal mass ( because it lies outside of the mond regime ) .",
    "therefore the test body will shift with respect to the reference body by a tiny but non - zero , time - dependent distance @xmath37 .    throughout the paper i will work in the ` earth - sun ' approximation in which the corrections due to the moon and planets are ignored .",
    "a question arises : how would account of these corrections change the results ?",
    "as was shown previously @xcite , the time and location of the shlem event can change slightly , but the effect itself will survive because its existence is based on topological arguments .",
    "another worry is whether we can use newtonian , not modified inertia mechanics to calculate the instant @xmath36 @xcite . to address this",
    ", we note that this calculation rests on the fact that the motion of the earth as a whole obeys the newtonian mechanics .",
    "of course , within the mond approach this is not absolutely true .",
    "moreover , the approach developed in @xcite and here allows one to calculate the mond corrections to the value of @xmath36 as precisely as one wishes .",
    "however , these corrections appear to be so tiny that they can be completely neglected even without their precise calculation . indeed , they would , in any case , include the suppressing factor of @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mass of the part of the earth affected by mond",
    ".    the mond - affected mass can be ( generously ) bounded from above as follows @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the earth radius , density , and linear rotation speed at the latitude @xmath44 .",
    "the time scale @xmath45 was defined in @xcite as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "altogether , the suppressing factor is @xmath49 which means that for the purposes of calculating the shlem instant and coordinates of the shlem spot , the newtonian mechanics can be used quite safely .",
    "we start by working in an inertial reference frame @xmath24 first .",
    "denote by @xmath50 the total physical force acting on the unit mass .",
    "then the mond equation of motion is @xmath51    although the present treatment can be used with any interpolating function @xmath4 , to obtain a definite result one needs to fix its concrete form ; the standard choice has been @xcite @xmath52 it is a matter of current debate @xcite whether this function satisfies the constraints derived from the precision solar system data @xcite . in any case , a new function can only be introduced after a reanalysis of the galactic rotation curves and a corresponding reestimate of the acceleration scale @xmath2 .",
    "( for instance , it would be inconsistent to use a new interpolating function with the old value of @xmath2 . ) for this reason , at the moment we have no choice for @xmath4 other than ( [ 18a ] ) , and it will be used from now on .    solving eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) for @xmath53 we obtain @xmath54 where @xmath55    next , we go into the laboratory reference frame by adding the non - inertial accelerations @xmath56 : @xmath57    to obtain a more specific equation , let us make simplifying assumptions similar to those usually made when analyzing the response of the gravitational wave detectors ( these assumptions will be justified in the next section when the solution of the equation of motion is obtained ) :    the body interacts with its environment ( such as a support , suspension etc . ) through an elastic force with negligible dissipation : @xmath58    random forces ( e.g. , due to thermal and vibrational noises ) are ignored .",
    "the test body is treated as a point mass , i.e. , we ignore a small variation of @xmath59 over its volume .",
    "terms of the second and higher order in the small parameter @xmath60 are neglected .",
    "displacement of the reference body is negligible .",
    "( the reference body is the body that plays the role of the origin of the laboratory reference frame .",
    "for example , in interferometers the reference body is one of the mirrors . )",
    "therefore , the total physical force will consist of the sum of gravitational forces and the elastic coupling : @xmath61 and the resulting equation of motion will take the form : @xmath62 let us now introduce the following coordinate system within the laboratory reference frame : @xmath63 is the west - to - east axis , @xmath64 the south - to - north axis , and @xmath23 is the vertical axis . then in our approximation the projection of the above equation on these axes will give @xmath65 where @xmath66.\\ ] ] thus we can ignore motion along @xmath64 and @xmath23 axes and our problem becomes one - dimensional .",
    "the obtained non - linear equation of motion is best solved numerically . but",
    "first we need to fix the frequency @xmath67 .",
    "it is determined by the suspension design : for example , @xmath68 hz in the case of ligo hz . ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 will be used .    at present",
    "there is some uncertainty in the magnitude of @xmath2 , the fundamental parameter of the theory .",
    "for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite it was found that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .. it is obtained if one outlier galaxy is removed from the sample on the basis of a possible error in the determination of its distance .",
    "the value @xmath72 is generally assumed in the literature . ] because of that , we will first assume that @xmath73 and then repeat the calculation with @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting solution for @xmath73 is shown in fig .",
    ".     corresponds to @xmath75 s. ]    the displacement amplitude has a maximum of @xmath76 m. this maximum is reached @xmath77 s after the shlem instant @xmath36 .",
    "having obtained the solution we can now fully justify the assumptions made earlier while deriving the equation of motion .",
    "first , the damping can indeed be completely neglected given that the relevant quality factor is @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "secondly , the linear time dependence in @xmath79 can only be used for ` short ' times @xmath80 so that @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the earth s angular velocity . in other words , the time intervals must be much less than @xmath83 hours . for our solution",
    "this condition obviously holds by a wide margin .",
    "thirdly , the neglect of transverse motion is justified by the same condition @xmath81 .",
    "fourthly , let us confirm that the size of the mirror does not matter .",
    "indeed , the difference in centrifugal accelerations that act on the mirror edges is @xmath84 where @xmath63 is the distance between edges , @xmath41 is the earth s radius and @xmath85  the lab latitude . in the case of ligo ,",
    "depending on the mirror orientation , @xmath63 can take the values of 9.3 cm ( the mirror thickness ) or 25 cm ( the mirror diameter ) . to ensure that this difference is insignificant",
    "we must require that it be less than the ` driving force ' @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "it is easy to check that this requirement is always fulfilled except during a very short interval @xmath87 around @xmath36 .",
    "but the contribution of this interval to the total displacement of the mirror is quite negligible as can be seen from fig .",
    "this justifies our treatment of the mirror as a mass point .",
    "finally , we can check if the displacement of the second ( reference ) mirror can be neglected . at the shlem latitude @xmath88",
    "the earth rotates with a linear speed of @xmath89 m / s ( eastward ) .",
    "this means that the shlem spot runs on the earth s surface with the same speed ( westward ) .",
    "thus , if a reference mirror is farther than 80 m from the test mirror , then the reference mirror s motion can be neglected during an observation interval of about 1 s around the shlem instant @xmath36 .",
    "otherwise ( i.e. , if the distance is shorter than 80 m or the observation interval is longer than 1 s ) the motion of the reference mirror must be taken into account . in that case",
    ", the signal will be equal to the difference between the two mirrors displacements .",
    "now , it is of interest to see how sensitive is the obtained solution to the variation of @xmath2 .",
    "if we use the value @xmath90 instead of @xmath91 then the maximum of the displacement amplitude will drop to @xmath92 m ( i.e. , by a factor of 4 ) . finally ,",
    "if the currently favored value @xmath93 is used , the maximum will be at @xmath94 m. in all cases considered , it takes approximately the same time ( @xmath95 counting from the shlem instant @xmath36 ) to reach the maximum .",
    "a variety of approaches to the experimental searches for the modified inertia effects have been proposed in ref .  @xcite . because we want to detect a tiny displacement / acceleration , it is natural to turn to the vast and vigorous area of gravitational experiments . in particular ,",
    "it was pointed out that the existing gravitational wave detectors could be a good starting point in designing the experiment .    at present , there are 2 types of gravitational wave facilities : the interferometers and resonators .",
    "the interferometers are generally more sensitive .",
    "so it is reasonable to start our discussion with them .",
    "the most sensitive of the currently operating interferometers are ligo and virgo @xcite .",
    "the heart of such a detector is a suspended mirror whose position can be monitored with an ultrahigh accuracy @xmath96 m. this is achieved by using a michelson - type of interferometer with a long arm length : @xmath97 km and @xmath98 km for ligo , or @xmath99 km for virgo .",
    "the detector s sensitivity is determined by the dimensionless ratio @xmath100 which can be translated into the dimensionless amplitude of a detectable gravitational wave . in some respects ,",
    "the expected shlem signal would be similar to the signal expected from a gravitational wave .",
    "however , there is a crucial difference between the two .",
    "the shlem signal is characterized by _ dimensional _ quantity  displacement of the test body @xmath101rather than a dimensionless ratio @xmath102 .    as a consequence , _ having long arm length @xmath103 is unnecessary for us _ as it does not affect the detector sensitivity to the shlem signal .",
    "this opens up an interesting opportunity of considering _ a ` short - arm ligo / virgo - like ' detector that would be based on the same ideas and technical know - how as ligo / virgo themselves , but would have a much smaller size that would allow it to be more easily transported and installed in a required location . _    in other words",
    ", we can imagine a setup that would be similar to ligo / virgo , but with a much shorter arm length ( as is the case for tama300 @xcite , geo @xcite , or aciga / aigo @xcite , where the respective arm lengths are about 300 m , 600 m , and 80 m ) .",
    "ligo s prototype interferometer on the caltech campus has even a shorter arm length of 40 metres .",
    "it is quite possible that additional effort would be required to ensure that the shorter arm - length does not compromize the overall sensitivity of the detector .",
    "for example , the issue of high laser power in a short arm would have to be carefully analyzed . at this stage ,",
    "though , it seems premature to go deeper into these details .    to assess the future potential of an interferometer setup",
    ", we have to take into account the plans @xcite to upgrade both ligo and virgo in the near future .",
    "the second generation detectors ( enhanced ligo and virgo+ ) will have their sensitivities increased two- or three - fold by 2009 . at the next stage ( advanced ligo , advanced virgo , 2014 )",
    "the increase of sensitivity will be ten - fold .",
    "further , the third generation underground detectors , such as the einstein gravitational - wave telescope ( e.t . ) , are currently under active discussion .",
    "thus it does not seem unrealistic to think that a suitable laboratory based on the ligo / virgo technology can be conceived in which the position of the mirror can be monitored with an accuracy sufficient for detecting the shlem effect .    in that case",
    ", how should one analyze the data ? because of a similarity between a shlem signal and a gravitational wave , the approach to this problem could be similar to that used in refs .",
    "@xcite . in particular , the paper @xcite by the joint ligo - virgo working group gives a detailed analysis of various statistical procedures aimed at detecting gravitational wave bursts using ligo and virgo facilities . as an input , astrophysical calculations",
    "are used which give the waveforms and amplitudes of signals corresponding to different sources .    since the distance , position , and nature of the source are not known in advance , one has to take into account many possibilities which lead to considerable uncertainty in the input data .",
    "by contrast , in our case , the input is unique : it is as if someone were able to predict everything about the burst  the source , its distance , right ascension and declination , and even the exact time of the burst .",
    "it makes the statistical analysis rather more certain and robust compared to the analysis required by a largely uncertain gravitational burst .    the complete information about the profile of the signal in our case is contained in eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) and fig .",
    "1 that give the time - dependence of the test body s displacement .",
    "if one is interested in the signal spectrum , it can be obtained from the same equation .",
    "based on this information , the candidate filters can be constructed via methods similar to those employed in ref .",
    "their performance can then be tested using simulations with the signal shape known from eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) and fig .  1 and thus the optimal filter can be selected .",
    "as is well known , the coincidence of signals in different detectors plays an important role in the strategies of the gravitational wave searches . in our case",
    ", various coincidence and anticoincidence schemes can be conceived due to the strict localization of the effect in time and space .",
    "for example , one can use the scheme in which the first detector is placed in the shlem spot in the northern hemisphere while the second detector is located symmetrically in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we can therefore hope that the chances of detecting the shlem signal could be better than the chances of detecting a gravitational wave burst of a similar magnitude .",
    "because the effect can only be observed at high latitudes , a question can be raised @xcite if icebergs floating in the ocean nearby ( say , @xmath104 km away ) can trigger false alarms by creating an excess of gravity of the order of @xmath2 .    to assess this possibility",
    ", we note that the short time scale of the effect needs to be taken into account .",
    "namely , to create a false alarm , external source must provide a _ variable gravity : its variation @xmath105 over the interval @xmath106 s must be of the order of @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath107 is the net excess gravity which the difference between the gravity due to the ice and the ` negative ' gravity due to the displaced water : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the distance between the centers of mass of the ice and the displaced water , @xmath110 is the hight of the above - water tip of the iceberg .",
    "the exact relation between @xmath109 and @xmath110 depends on the iceberg s shape .",
    "for instance , a cubic shape gives @xmath111 . as we will see",
    "shortly , the ` shape factor ' would not greatly affect the final result so @xmath112 will be assumed .",
    "_    next , suppose that the iceberg s velocity is @xmath113 . then during the time @xmath45 it will shift by the distance @xmath114 relative to the lab .",
    "that will lead to gravity variation of the order of @xmath115 leads to the following condition : @xmath116 therefore , the iceberg mass , tip height , and velocity must satisfy @xmath117 such parameters appear to be unrealistically large . indeed , a very large iceberg would have a mass of about @xmath118 kg , with @xmath119 m @xcite so the product @xmath120 falls short by several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus icebergs can not trigger false alarms .",
    "astrophysically inspired laboratory - based experiments such as dark matter searches have become a common part of the physics landscape .",
    "the laboratory tests of mond is a much needed , complementary activity .",
    "it is a new virgin territory waiting to be explored .",
