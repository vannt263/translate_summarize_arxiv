    "the recent influence of the theory of networks @xcite on the classic field of coupled oscillatory units @xcite has led to the discovery of a plethora of novel phenomena , especially when the coupling between units becomes more sophisticated , mimicking naturally interacting systems . among the complex oscillatory patterns that may emerge ,",
    "are the so - called `` chimera states '' @xcite , which have recently attracted a lot of attention .",
    "these are states , in which identically coupled units spontaneously develop coexisting synchronous ( coherent ) and asynchronous ( incoherent ) parts .",
    "many recent theoretical works have focused on the study of chimera states in a variety of physical systems .",
    "typical models that have been numerically investigated include the kuramoto phase oscillator @xcite , periodic and chaotic maps @xcite , the stuart - landau model @xcite , the van der pol oscillator @xcite as well as models addressing neuron dynamics such the fitzhugh - nagumo oscillator @xcite , the hindmarsh - rose model @xcite , the so - called sniper model of excitability type - i @xcite , or the hodgkin - huxley model @xcite .",
    "moreover , chimera states have been reported in populations of coupled pendula @xcite , in autonomous boolean networks @xcite , in one - dimensional superconducting meta - materials @xcite , and time - varying networks @xcite .    following the theoretical predictions ,",
    "chimera states were experimentally verified for the first time in populations of coupled chemical oscillators @xcite and in optical coupled - map lattices realized by liquid - crystal light modulators @xcite .",
    "recently , in a purely mechanical experiment involving two groups of identical metronomes , it was shown that chimeras emerge naturally as a coexistence of two competing synchronization patterns @xcite .",
    "chimeras were also realized in experiments involving electronic nonlinear oscillators with delay @xcite and electrochemical oscillator systems @xcite .",
    "chimera states find increasing interest due to the possible connections to various phenomena observed in biological and social systems .",
    "as stated in the review paper of panaggio and abrams @xcite , chimera states could possibly explain the phenomenon of unihemispheric sleep observed in dolphins and some birds which sleep with half of their brain @xcite as well as ventricular fibrillation @xcite .    in the current study",
    ", we attempt to bring in evidence chimera states in the fields of chemical reaction kinetics and ecology .",
    "ecological models in the form of reactive dynamical systems have been previously used to describe the interactions between multiple species ( referred to also as particles ) . in most cases",
    "the dynamics follows a mean field ( mf ) rate equations approach , which describe global dynamical features @xcite .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations are employed to address specific details of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the systems @xcite .",
    "along the same lines , dynamical systems describing interactions between different chemical species are studied .",
    "common examples involving heterogeneous catalytic dynamics are the reactions @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath2 @xcite , all taking place on a platinum catalyst , the reaction @xmath3 on various catalysts @xcite , etc .",
    "all above processes are described as dynamical systems using the langmuir - hinshelwood mechanism @xcite .",
    "analogous modeling is extensively used for the well known oscillatory belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite . in epidemiology ,",
    "reactive systems are frequently used where the species correspond to infected individuals , susceptible or recovered ones , and they can dynamically infect other parts of the population @xcite .",
    "all these systems are commonly viewed as reactive dynamics involving reaction , birth ( or adsorption ) , and death ( desorption ) processes .    in the field of experimental reactive dynamics",
    "there have already been several studies discussing the existence of chimera states .",
    "some interesting works include the photosensitive belousov - zhabotinsky reaction @xcite as well as experiments with electrochemical oscillators @xcite .",
    "similarly , a social analogue of a chimera state was reported in @xcite , where the authors investigated the emergence of localized coherence in two interacting populations of social agents .",
    "two social models were implemented , the axelrod model for culture dissemination @xcite and the bounded confidence model by deffuant et al .",
    "different synchronization patterns were obtained , including chimera states where one subpopulation of agents remained synchronized while the other was desynchronized .",
    "it is interesting to note here that in all experiments as well as in the social systems presented above , the subpopulations of elements are _ ab initio _ prepared and serve as a basis for the synchronized / desynchronized activity .",
    "on the other hand , in the numerical investigations cited above and in the current study , the coherent / incoherent regions emerge spontaneously from the interplay between the system parameters , dynamics , and initial conditions .    the main ingredients for the emergence of a chimera state in coupled oscillatory dynamics is the stable oscillatory pattern of the single elements together with the nonlocal character of the interactions . a toy model which exhibits well defined oscillations in the form of a limit cycle and is relevant in ecological , chemical , and social dynamics is the lattice limit cycle ( llc ) model , proposed in @xcite .",
    "the llc model is a nonlinear system that describes reaction , birth , and death processes and studies how the concentrations of the specific species change with time under the influence of the control parameters .",
    "the llc is an ideal model to study the development of chimera states in population dynamics for three reasons : ( a ) it describes common ecological / social / chemical processes using reaction , birth , and death differential equations , ( b ) its dynamics is characterized by a limit cycle , and ( c ) when needed , it allows for direct implementation on a lattice with single species occupancy for a more realistic representation of the dynamics .    in this study",
    ", the capacity of the llc model to produce chimera states will be investigated .",
    "the chimera attributes will be discussed as the system approaches the critical point of the hopf bifurcation .",
    "furthermore , we will explore the influence of the connection topology on the chimera features . in population dynamics , exchange in the form of spatial diffusion between individuals residing on different parts of the system",
    "is frequent : people move from one city to another , birds migrate , individual animals circulate from one herd to another , etc . in natural and social dynamics",
    ", the circulation of individuals has often nonlocal character and thus it is natural to investigate phenomena like chimera states which have their origin in nonlocal interactions . in particular",
    ", it is important to consider hierarchical connectivity in the coupling of the llc dynamics , since the habitats of populations have often hierarchical / fractal distributions and morphologies : the city locations are fractally distributed @xcite , the mammal and bird habitats are located on fragmented landscapes that affect their community dynamics @xcite , and the viruses spread in complex socio - geographic networks @xcite . as we will see in the sequel , hierarchical connectivity induces traveling chimera states , a novel feature in this field .    the work is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "additional results on connectivity with gaps are included in the appendix . in the concluding section",
    "we summarize our results and discuss open problems .",
    "originally , the llc scheme @xcite was devised as a highly nonlinear model for a cyclic reaction - diffusion process with predator - prey interactions among three particles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the reaction scheme reads :    [ eq01 ] @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the interaction rates .",
    "the system  ( [ eq01 ] ) being an ecological model was inspired by heterogeneous catalytic reactions , where single particles are deposited on the sites of a catalyst surface .",
    "these particles interact with their neighbors or diffuse on the surface .",
    "the catalyst is usually represented as a regular two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice ( square , honeycomb , triangular ) , or even as a fractal lattice with impurities @xcite .",
    "these catalytic applications indicate the need to represent the empty lattice sites as a virtual species , which participates in the reaction and diffusion processes as well .",
    "the llc model thus involves one virtual species , @xmath6 , which represents the empty sites and two `` normal '' species , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which are engaged in the three reactions .",
    "the scheme ( [ eq01 ] ) describes that the interaction of two particles @xmath4 and two particles @xmath5 turns one of the @xmath4-particles into @xmath5 while the other @xmath4-particle turns into @xmath6 [ eq .  ( [ eq1a ] ) ] .",
    "the positions ( lattice sites ) where the particles are located may or may not be first neighbors , depending on the model ( see ref .",

    "( [ eq1c ] ) represents the cooperative death of a particle @xmath5 leaving an empty site @xmath6 .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in recent years .",
    "initially , it was implemented on a square lattice with single occupancy per lattice site using kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations .",
    "direct kmc realizations on the 2d square lattice with nearest neighbor interactions produced intricate fractal patterns and local oscillations of the species concentrations @xcite .",
    "later on , long - distance diffusion was introduced as a mixing mechanism allowing the species to react with all particles within a specific range , thus giving them the possibility to change their places in the lattice at finite or infinite distances @xcite .",
    "the model was also studied from the viewpoint of an abstract network of phases that was shown to have features of a scale - free network through calculations of the degree distribution and clustering coefficient @xcite .    in the mf approach ,",
    "the system is described by three 4th - order nonlinear differential equations for the temporal total concentrations @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 of the respective particles @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . after applying the conservation condition @xmath14",

    "in the present work , we have demonstrated for the first time the existence of chimera states in a population dynamics model , reflecting the various tendencies of local communities to behave ( oscillate ) coherently or incoherently within the same network .",
    "we have shown that the dynamics of the nonlocally coupled system strongly depends on the character of the local behavior of the nodes . when the parameters of the individual llc nodes are close to the hopf bifurcation , chimera states can not be observed in the system . in this regime , all strongly nonlinear 4th - order terms become weak and the corresponding limit cycle oscillations lose their spiking form resembling simple harmonic motion of small amplitude .",
    "when the internal bifurcation parameter of each node increases away from the hopf bifurcation , the trajectories approach the heteroclinic invariant manifolds of the saddle points producing spikes followed by long resting periods .",
    "this type of local dynamics allows for the existence of a variety of chimera and multichimera states , which depend both on the parameters of the individual system , and the coupling .    while the introduction of single gaps in the connectivity matrix induces merging and splitting of the ( in)coherent parts of the chimera states ( see appendix  [ sec : chimera - gaps ] ) , hierarchical arrangement of gaps results in the emergence of nontrivial phenomena in which the ( in)coherent regions show nested structures and travel along the ring , keeping their profiles statistically stable in time .",
    "moreover , we have found that the speed of this motion decreases with increasing coupling strength .",
    "complex nested chimera structures , when regarded from the viewpoint of population dynamics , show the rich organization which can emerge in communities of nonlinearly interacting populations .",
