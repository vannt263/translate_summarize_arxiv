    "the intravenous administration of nanoconstructs for the precise delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents has been demonstrated to have potential in the fight against deadly diseases , such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases  @xcite .",
    "nanoconstructs are man - made , biocompatible and biodegradable objects that transported by the blood flow can reach any location within the vascular network and release their therapeutic cargo thereof  @xcite . over the last decade , nanoconstructs exhibiting different sizes , shapes , surface properties and , more recently , also mechanical stiffnesses have been presented  @xcite .",
    "the size can range from a few tens of nanometers to a few microns ; the shape can be spherical , discoidal , cylindrical ; the surface can exhibit a positive , negative or neutral electrostatic charge and can be decorated with a variety of moieties for specific cell recognition ; and the stiffness can vary from that of cells to metals .",
    "size , shape , surface and stiffness have been shown by the authors and others to significantly affect the vascular and extravascular behaviour of systemically injected nanoconstructs , and are therefore referred to as the _ 4s design parameters _  @xcite .",
    "an incredibly large set of nanoconstructs would be identified by considering all possible combinations of these 4s parameters .",
    "it is therefore simply impractical to screen all of them for their biomedical properties by in vitro and in vivo testing . in this context",
    ", computational tools can help in reducing the screening time and cost as well as in identifying a sub - set of optimal nanoconstruct configurations to be , eventually , tested experimentally .",
    "the authors have extensively employed computational tools for elucidating the mechanisms regulating the vascular transport and adhesion of nanoconstructs with different size , shape and surface properties  @xcite .",
    "for instance , mathematical and computational analyses led to the in silico identification of sub - micron nanoconstructs with a discoidal shape as one of the best size / shape combinations for targeting the tumor vasculature .",
    "this was also demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "indeed , multiple techniques have been proposed for modeling vascular flow and nanoconstruct transport in a variety of vascular districts , including direct numerical simulations ( dns )  @xcite , immersed finite element methods ( ifem )  @xcite , immersed boundary methods ( ibm )  @xcite , and isogeometric analysis ( ia )  @xcite .",
    "these approaches are all based on the discretization and numerical integration of the navier - stokes and continuity equations , and still remains challenging the modelling of vascular transport of multiple particles with complex shapes and mechanical properties . on the other hand , particle - based techniques , such as the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) ,",
    "provide simpler implementation , higher flexibility for a variety of applications and can be readily translated into parallel computing , thus allowing to handle complex flows and boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "lbm uses the mesoscopic boltzmann equation to determine macroscopic fluid dynamics and mass transport and has been already employed for modelling the vascular transport of particle suspensions and deformable cells  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the transport of particles with different shapes next to a rigid wall is considered .",
    "a combined lb - ib model is used for solving the fluid dynamics and then , estimating the forces over the immersed boundary .",

    "the rigid wall boundary conditions are imposed through the zou - he framework to guarantee mass conservation and a moving least squares ( mls ) algorithm is employed to accurately reconstruct the forcing term in the boltzmann equation accounting for the presence of the boundary  @xcite . for the lbm modelling , the lattice equation is derived on a rigorous mathematical basis by a gauss - hermite projection .",
    "the particle dynamics is simulated through a rigid - body - dynamics equations solver  @xcite weakly coupled with the flow solver .    in the sequel ,",
    "first the model is validated against two conventional test cases : the sedimentation of circular and elliptical cylinders in a quiescent fluid .",
    "then , the transport of circular , elliptical , rectangular , square and triangular particles in a linear laminar flow is analyzed , at a fixed reynolds number ( re=20 ) .",

    "here we adopt a discretization in velocity space of the mb distribution based on the quadrature of a hermite polynomial expansion of this distribution  @xcite . in this way it is possible to get a lattice equation that exactly recovers a finite number of leading order moments of the mb distribution .",
    "in such a scheme it has been later realized that a regularization step @xcite is needed for @xmath24 to re - project the post - collision distribution functions onto the hermite space @xcite .",

    "it is noteworthy that , once reached the equilibrium position , the local slip velocity profile almost symmetrises ( never becoming symmetrical ) and so the repulsive force from the wall becomes small ( never becoming null ) .",

    "indeed , @xmath167 is obtained by solving the newton s moment equation , @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is the applied torque and @xmath80 the rotational inertia . in particular , it is confirmed that particles with larger @xmath80 exhibit an increase in oscillation period .",
    "* figure *  [ allomega ] shows the comparison between the time variation of @xmath167 obtained considering square , elliptical , triangular , and rectangular particles .",
    "the rectangular particle has a major edge length of @xmath29 and an aspect ratio of @xmath188 .",
    "the oscillation period is increased from @xmath189 to @xmath190 with an amplitude of about @xmath191 and @xmath192 around the mean value of @xmath193 when the square and the rectangular particle are respectively considered .",
    "moreover , one can observe the different shape of @xmath194 .",
    "the triangular and the square particles present a symmetrical oscillation around a certain mean value . on the other hand ,",
    "the elliptical and rectangular particles present an asymmetry in both , the peak values and the peak width . precisely , due to the elongated shape of such particles",
    ", the oscillation of the angular distribution grows with the ratio between the two main axes of the particle ( * figure *  [ allomega ] ) .",
    "the elongated shape leads to larger and more peaked velocities .",
    "in other words , the peculiar angular velocity distribution , dependent on particles shape and surface , is responsible for the oscillation around the equilibrium position in the linear velocity and consequently in the trajectories of the centre of mass of the particles .",
    "a combined lattice boltzmann - immersed boundary ( lb - ib ) model was proposed for predicting the transport dynamics of particles with different shapes , including conventional circular particles as well as less common elliptical , square , rectangular and triangular particles . a comparison between the predictions of the proposed lb - ib method and benchmark results available in the literature for the sedimentation of circular and elliptical cylinders in a quiescent fluid , along with a mesh - refinement study for the latter test case , showed a very good agreement , thus confirming the accuracy of the presented approach .",
    "similarly for the near wall dynamics of a circular cylinder in a linear laminar flow , the lb - ib method was able to predict the complex lateral motion of the particle in agreement with the known results of joseph and colleagues .",
    "specifically , it was shown that , regardless of the initial location and velocity , the final equilibrium position of the circular cylinder coincides with the middle stream line , with a zero slip linear velocity . at the considered reynolds number ( re=20 ) , which characterizes the vascular transport of macro - circulation , only minimal differences were observed between the circular and other shaped cylinders . after following qualitatively similar trajectories",
    ", square and elliptical cylinders found their equilibrium position on the middle stream line too .",
    "differently , the triangular cylinder reached its equilibrium at 0.53  h. however , the angular velocities show a time - dependent behaviour with amplitude and period significantly affected by the particle shape .",
    "interestingly , beside the expected increase in rotational period , the more elongated particles ( elliptical and rectangular ) also exhibit a dramatic reduction in the minimum rotational velocity which , for very elongated rectangular particles , would stay at zero for almost the whole period .",
    "it should be here empathised again that the reynolds number considered ( re=20 ) in the study would better represent the transport in large vessel of relatively large particles .",
    "the actual capillary transport of nanoconstructs would be characterised by significantly smaller reynolds number ( re@xmath195 ) .",
    "indeed , the same computational approach here proposed can be readily applied to study transport process at very low reynolds numbers .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations at re=20 allowed the authors to validate accurately the model against well known test cases .",
    "collectively this data demonstrates that the proposed lb - ib approach can be efficiently used for predicting complex particle dynamics in biologically relevant flows . in the near future , three - dimensional simulations at low reynolds number ( re@xmath196 ) of rigid and deformable bodies",
    "would help in reproducing and predicting lateral drifting and vascular adhesion of nano / micro - particles at the micro - circulation level .",
    "this could provide significant contributions to the field of computational nano - medicine and drug delivery .",
