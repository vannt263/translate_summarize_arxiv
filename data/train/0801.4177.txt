    "this study was undertaken as a part of current extensive theoretical investigations of asteroseismology of a neutron star@xcite ( see also references therein ) that have been boosted by recent discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) of x - ray luminosity in the decaying flares of two magnetars@xcite , sgr 1806 - 20 and sgr 1900 + 14 , with concomitant suggestion to interpret this variability as caused by quake induced differentially rotational , torsional , oscillations . following this suggestion the focus of most theoretical works is on computing the frequency spectra of odd - parity torsional mode of shear vibrations and less attention",
    "is paid to the even parity spheroidal elastic mode . however , from the viewpoint of modern global seismology@xcite , the spheroidal vibrational mode in a solid star and planet has the same physical significance as the toroidal one in the sense that these two fundamental modes owe their existence to one and the same restoring force@xcite . in this light",
    "there is a possibility that , by not considering both these modes on an equal footing , we may miss discovering certain essential novelties which are consequences of solid mechanical laws governing seismic vibrations of superdense matter of neutron stars . adhering to this attitude and continuing our current investigations@xcite",
    ", we derive here spectral equations for the frequency of both spheroidal and torsional elastic nodeless vibrations in the solid crust of quaking neutron star and examine what conclusions can be drawn regarding low - frequency qpos whose physical nature still remain unclear .",
    "in this paper we follow the line of argument of the standard two - component , core - crust , model of quaking neutron star@xcite in which crustal metal - like material ( composed of nuclei dispersed in the sea of relativistic electrons ) is treated as a highly robust to compressional distortions elastic material continuum of a uniform density @xmath0 characterized by constant value of shear modulus @xmath1 . in this model",
    "it is presumed that the quake - induced non - compressional seismic vibrations driven by bulk force of pure shear elastic deformations ( which are not accompanied by fluctuations in density @xmath2 ) can be adequately modeled by equation of newtonian , non - relativistic , solid mechanics @xmath3,\\quad u_{kk}=\\nabla_k u_k=0 .",

    "the linear relation between tensors of shear elastic stresses @xmath8 and shear deformations or strains @xmath9 is the hooke s law of elastic ( reversal ) shear deformations .    in what follows we focus on poorly investigated regime of nodeless shear vibrations in which the fields of oscillating material displacement subject to the vector laplace equation@xcite @xmath10 this last equation can be thought of as the long wavelength limit of vector helmholtz equation describing standing - wave regime of vibrations@xcite . in these latter works",
    "it has been shown that the eigenfrequency problem of global nodeless vibrations of a solid star can be unambiguously solved with aid of the rayleigh s energy method . in the present paper",
    "this method is extended to the case of spheroidal nodeless vibrations which are considered in one line with torsional ones .",
    "the stating point of the energy variational method is the integral equation of the energy balance @xmath11 which is obtained by scalar multiplication of equation of solid mechanics , ( [ e2.1 ] ) , with @xmath12 and integration over the volume of seismogenic layer .",
    "the field @xmath13 can be conveniently represented in the following separable form @xmath14 with the field of instantaneous ( time - independent ) displacements @xmath15 obeying , as follows from ( [ e2.2 ] ) , to equations @xmath16 and @xmath17 stands for the temporal amplitude of vibrations . inserting ( [ e2.4 ] ) in ( [ e2.3 ] )",

    "spherical coordinates with fixed polar axis , the solution of ( [ e2.5 ] ) corresponding to nodeless spheroidal vibrations , @xmath23 , is given by the even parity poloidal ( polar ) vector field and instantaneous displacements in the torsional mode , @xmath24 , are described by the odd parity toroidal ( axial ) vector field : @xmath25 .",

    "the boundary condition on the star surface , @xmath34 , is dictated by symmetry of the general toroidal solution of the vector laplace equation .",

    "the obtained spectral formulae ( 15 ) and ( 26)-(27 ) describe the frequencies of both spheroidal and torsional nodeless oscillations as functions of the multipole degree @xmath27 .",
    "the natural unit of frequency @xmath50 of shear elastic vibrations and the fractional depth @xmath51 of peripheral seismogenic layer are input parameters carrying information about material properties of neutron star matter ( density , shear modulus ) and geometrical sizes of star and seismoactive zone . considering the observation data for sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 , we demonstrate here how the obtained spectral equations can be used to eliminate some uncertainties in identification of qpos .",

    "the result of this procedure is shown in upper panel of fig.2 by solid line . then , making use of the fixed in the above manner parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we compute ( with the aid of spectral formula ( [ e3.6 ] ) ) the frequency of spheroidal mode @xmath72 .",

    "hz and @xmath75 hz we extract parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 entering in our spectral formulae for torsional mode , equations ( [ e4.9])-([e4.10 ] ) .    in fig.3 set out very clearly the case for identifying two non - identified before low - frequency qpos in data for sgr 1806 - 20 ( israel et al 2005 ) , namely @xmath76 hz and @xmath77 hz , highlighted by triangles .",
    "the obtained spectral formulae for the frequency of nodeless elastic vibrations trapped in the finite - depth seismogenic layer may be of some interest in its own right from the viewpoint of general theoretical seismology@xcite in the sense that they can be utilized in the study of seismic vibrations of more wide class of solid celestial objects such as earth - like planets .",
    "one of the remarkable feature of considered model is that the dipole nodeless overtones possess properties of goldstone soft modes , that is , the dipole overtones emerge if and on only if the elastic vibrations turn out to be locked in the peripheral layer of finite thickness .",
    "it is shown that obtained spectral equations are consistent with the existence treatment of low - frequency qpos in the x - ray luminosity of flares sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806 - 20 as caused by quake - induced torsional nodeless vibrations .",
    "what is newly disclosed here is that previously non - identified low - frequency qpos in data for sgr 1806 - 20 can be attributed to nodeless dipole torsional and spheroidal vibrations , namely , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
