    "a number of important hi line surveys have been carried out in the last decade , bringing new insights in particular to the properties of the extragalactic population at @xmath0 .",
    "those surveys have been made possible by the advent of focal plane receiver arrays and telescope upgrades , which have increased the survey speeds by an order of magnitude with respect to what was possible before their inception . while large surveys of hi in galaxies had been carried out in the 1980s and 1990s , those were targeted on optically selected samples generally motivated by goals other than the understanding of the characteristics of the hi source population .",
    "for example , large samples of disk galaxies have been observed to map the large - scale structures in the local universe , or to measure the cosmological peculiar velocity field , or study the environment in clusters , but in those studies hi sources were tools , the support riders in the _ peloton _ , rather than the cycling team leader .",
    "we learned much about the properties that made an hi source a good cosmic lamp post , but we did not know the shape of the cosmic hi mass function .",
    "the first `` blind '' hi surveys , such as ahiss and adbs , started bringing to our attention the characteristics of the dwarf galaxy population , and the following larger surveys confirmed the fact that the most abundant `` island universes '' are in fact low mass systems barely able to hold on to a fraction of their baryons and , even more extreme , far less able to convert those baryons into stars .",
    "some toyed with the idea that these systems would be so abundant that they would fill the gap between the counts of low mass galaxies and that of low mass halos predicted by theory , known and not satisfactorily explained since the onset of the  paradigm .",
    "the now solid determination of the hi mass function demonstrates that idea to be wrong .",
    "however , the new surveys are suggesting interesting avenues that may lead to a solution of the `` problem '' , so we devote a fair fraction of this review to the investigation of these developments .",
    "we start section [ sec : review ] by visiting a set of scaling relations , useful in the planning and design of a survey .",
    "we close that section with an illustration of the power of a blind survey data set in reaching very deep in signal extraction , by careful application of stacking techniques . in section [ sec : properties ] we review the properties of the hi source population , from the clustering characteristics to the hi mass function , the relationships between gas content and properties in spectral domains other than hi , to the hi view of star formation laws , closing with the baryonic mass function and the assessment of the baryon deficit of small mass halos .",
    "section [ dark ]  is a show - and - tell interlude , in which we describe the extreme properties of a few sources in the alfalfa catalog .",
    "section [ tbtf ] explores the conflicts between observations and  predictions arising from the use of the abundance matching technique .",
    "the last section is dedicated to a highlights report of proposed ( and some already started ) new surveys .",
    "sky positions are for the epoch 2000.0 and distances are derived for @xmath1  mpc@xmath2 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the sensitivity of a radio telescope depends primarily on ( a ) the system s `` gain '' @xmath3 , which to first order is the area of its primary mirror ; ( b ) the noise contributed by the electronics , ground , atmospheric and cosmic sources of radiation , which is measured by the system temperature @xmath4 ; and ( c ) the frequency bandwidth @xmath5 over which radiation is collected .",
    "this is summarized by the radiometer equation _",
    "rms = ( t_sys/ g)(2  t_intf_x)^-1/2 where @xmath6 is the rms noise of a spectrum with the telescope pointing at blank sky , @xmath7 is the integration time , @xmath8 , of order unity , accounts for source angular extent , observational switching technique , bandpass subtraction mode , spectrometer clipping losses , etc . , and the factor of 2 accounts for the addition of two independent polarization channels . in the computation of sensitivity , @xmath5 will refer to the spectral resolution needed to detect and resolve the narrowest signal the survey will be sensitive to ; in the estimate of survey speed , @xmath5 will be the instantaneous bandpass of the receiver system .",
    "most of the hi in a galaxy is found in a warm , neutral , optically thin thermal phase of several @xmath9 k and the solid angle subtended by the cold neutral phase of the interstellar medium is small , so the mass of a spatially unresolved , optically thin source at the luminosity distance @xmath10 , expressed in mpc , is = 2.35610 ^ 5  d_mpc^2 1+z s(v ) dv , where @xmath11 is the line profile in jy , integrated over the doppler velocity @xmath12 in . approximating @xmath13 , the product of peak flux times the line width at the 50% level , the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath14 ) can be used to infer the scaling of the minimum detectable hi mass at the distance @xmath10 m_hi ( t_sys / g )  d_mpc^2 w_50 ^ -  t_int^-1/2 figure [ fig : fluxlim ] shows the flux distribution of sources detected by alfalfa , as a function of their line widths .",
    "the exponent @xmath15 is -1 for @xmath16 , and it changes progressively to @xmath17 for @xmath18 , due to the impact of standing waves on the spectral baselines .",
    "a blind , spectro - photometric hi survey does not deliver a flux - limited source sample , but rather one in which the sensitivity limit is a function of the spectral linewidth of the source .",
    "[ fig : fluxlim ]        in the case of the alfalfa survey , with an average integration time @xmath19 seconds per beam solid angle , an hi source with @xmath20  and @xmath21  can be detected to a distance of 6.5 mpc , and a source of hi mass @xmath22  to a distance of 20 mpc , as illustrated in figure [ fig : spaen ] .",
    "a useful scaling relation regards the minimum integration time required to detect a source of hi mass @xmath23 , line width @xmath24 , at the distance @xmath10 t_int ( t_sys / g)^2  m_hi^-2  d_mpc^4  w_50 ^ -2 i.e. the depth of a survey of given @xmath25 increases only as @xmath26 . for",
    "a given hi mass , the volume sampled by a survey with a telescope of given @xmath25 is v_survey(m_hi ) = _ survey  d^3_max/3 _ survey t_int^3/4 where @xmath27 is the solid angle covered by the survey and @xmath28 is the maximum distance at which the mass @xmath23 can be detected . that volume is proportional to the number of sources detected by the survey , so the time necessary to complete it is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the telescope beam ( or beams , for arrays ) , thus t_survey v_survey   t_int^1/4 i.e. for a fixed @xmath27 , the time required to complete it increases as @xmath26 . once @xmath7 is large enough for a desired @xmath23 to be detectable , it is more advantageous to maximize @xmath27 than to increase the survey depth by increasing @xmath7 .",
    "for example , in the design of the alfalfa survey it was desired that the survey sample median distance correspond to a fair cosmological distance of @xmath31100 mpc , the choice of which determined @xmath7 .",
    "after that , the survey volume was obtained by expanding @xmath27 .    in the case of blind surveys carried out with a single dish , such as hipass and alfalfa ,",
    "the vast majority of detected sources have angular size much smaller than the telescope beam .",
    "the photometric parameter used for their characterization is then the line flux integral , information on the morphology and spatial extent of the source being lost .",
    "a lower limit for the averaged hi column density of the source can be obtained , by dividing the hi mass by the areal extent subtended by the beam . for a telescope with an elliptical beam , such as the case of the arecibo antenna with its 7-horn feed array ( `` alfa '' ) , with major and minor axes @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( fwhp , in arcminutes ) :    @xmath34    large single dishes with focal plane detector arrays , such as the arecibo and parkes telescopes , are well suited to carry out wide field , blind hi extragalactic surveys , such as alfalfa and hipasss . however , follow - up synthesis imaging is necessary in order to obtain direct information on dynamical parameters , such as the mass contained within the hi radius of the source and the shape of the rotation curve",
    ". synthesis imaging can provide maps of hi column densities , but can wholly miss flux from diffuse regions extending over solid angles exceeding that of the synthesized beam .",
    "a combination of both types of instrument is thus the most economical and scientifically rewarding : the single dish survey is most efficient in delivering large samples , characterizing the statistical properties of the hi source population , and discovering the most extremes member of such population ; the synthesis arrays allow the investigation of the structure , dynamics and physical circumstances of selected sources .      before the 1990s ,",
    "large extragalactic hi surveys were carried out , seeking detection of optically selected galaxy samples .",
    "for these surveys , the task of understanding the properties of the hi source population was secondary to that of using the hi source samples as tools towards the achievement of other scientific goals , such as the impact of environment on gas bearing objects in clusters , the determination of the parameters of the cosmological distance scale , the investigation of the topology of the large scale distribution of galaxies and mapping the deviations from smooth hubble flow produced by large scale density inhomogeneities .",
    "the studies with the largest numbers @xmath35 of detections were obtained with the arecibo ( @xmath36 ) , nanay , parkes and green bank ( a few @xmath9 each ) telescopes .",
    "the most conspicuous bias in the selection of sample candidates for these studies was a preference for high optical luminosity systems , morphologically classified as disks , which tended to neglect field dwarfs .",
    "an interesting statistic illustrating this bias is that more than 2/3 of detections by alfalfa correspond to galaxies never observed before in the hi line .",
    "results of these studies are documented in reviews and data releases such as haynes et al .",

    "these surveys will not be reviewed further .",
    "the first strictly blind and moderately blind extragalactic hi surveys were made at arecibo in the late 1990 s , during the period in which the telescope was being upgraded .",
    "two surveys ( ahiss : zwaan et al . 1997 ; adbs : rosenberg & schneider 2000 ) provided the first indications of the statistical importance of the field dwarf galaxies , whose baryonic component is dominated by atomic gas rather than stars .",
    "hipass ( meyer et al . 2004 ) was the first truly wide - field , extragalactic hi survey , covering 3/4 of the whole sky with its 13-element focal plane detector array .    with its large collecting aperture ,",
    "the 53 year old 305 m telescope at arecibo remains the most sensitive hi detector . during its first 30 years of operation",
    ", its use as a blind survey machine was limited due to the fact that the correction of the spherical aberration of its primary mirror was achieved by means of line feeds .",
    "these are waveguide contraptions with very narrow instantaneous bandwidth and lacking a usable , extended field of view , which constrained to single pixel observations .",
    "completion of the gregorian upgrade in the late 1990s expanded the field of view , making possible the installation of receiver arrays , broadening the bandwidth to 300 mhz ; sensitivity was further increased by improving the illuminated area of the primary mirror and installing a 1-km long screen , peripheral to the primary , that reduced ground radiation pick - up and improved performance at high zenith angles . operating in l - band , the 7-beam alfa ( arecibo l - band feed array )",
    "array became available in 2005 .",
    "several hi surveys with ambitious goals were then started .",
    "of particular interest were the four extragalactic hi surveys : arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa , giovanelli et al .",
    "2005 ) , arecibo galactic environment survey ( ages , auld et al .",

    "the statistics of ages is difficult to compare with that of other surveys , since that survey is a collection of selected fields of specific interest , such as galaxy cluster fields ( e.g. a1367 ) and the near fields of objects with tidal remnants ( e.g. ngc 7332/7339 ) , each field being mapped blindly , but characterized by different environmental properties .",
    "the total area mapped by ages is about 200 deg@xmath52 , for a detection rate of @xmath5315 sources per deg@xmath52 , partly resulting from the deep sensitivity limit of 0.7 mjy and partly to the selection of _ a priori _ known to be significantly overdense regions .",

    "the paucity of low mass galaxies , in comparison with the abundance of low mass halos predicted by , has been known for a long time , appearing in a variety of guises , e.g. as the  void phenomenon  ( peebles 2001 ) and in the derivation of luminosity , hi mass , rotational velocity functions ( baldry et al . 2008 ; klypin et al.2014 ; zwaan et al .",

    "because the hi gas extends radially farther than any other directly observable component , the observed rotational velocity gets as close to the halo velocity as it gets .",

    "it thus remains unclear whether full hydrodynamical simulations can save the day for  in low galaxy density environments .",
    "inspection of figure [ fig : testam ] shows that low mass halos detectable at 21 cm , albeit not abundant , do exist .",

    "( 2012 ) recently made a discovery of high relevance to the tbtf issue . extracting a sample of dwarf galaxies from the sdss spectroscopic data base ( objects of stellar mass @xmath119 between @xmath22 and @xmath221 )",

    "a galaxy was classified as star forming if h@xmath204 emission is detectable and there is evidence of a strong 4000  break .",
    "two subsamples were drawn according to a simple environmental criterion : the projected distance to the nearest massive galaxy .",
    "if that distance is greater than 1.5 mpc , the dwarf object is part of the `` field '' population . by these criteria",
    ", they found that more than 99% of 2951 field dwarfs are currently forming stars .",
    "this finding is surprising , since the history of star formation in dwarf galaxies is thought to be episodic ( tolstoy et al . 2009 ) with a typical duration of starburst events in dwarfs of 200 to 400 myr ( mcquinn et al .",
    "if the typical field dwarf is star - forming for only a fraction of the time , a complementary fraction of field dwarfs must be in a quiescent state .",
    "if the average field dwarf has only a few starbursting episodes over a hubble time , the uncounted , dormant field dwarfs could account for the missing objects responsible for the steep drop in the @xmath213 vs. @xmath222 relation in figure [ fig : testam ] .",
    "halos of mass lower than @xmath223 ( @xmath224 )  may have been able to form stars before reionization , but unable to accrete fresh gas from the igm and thus to form stars after reionization ( hoeft et al .",
    "however gas accretion and star sormation may have become possible at later epochs , especially in low density environments ( ricotti 2009 ) .",
    "in fact some do now",
    ". these items of evidence would suggest that between star formation episodes field dwarf galaxies can be dark , their optical and hi emissions being quenched .",
    "the histories of star formation of nearby dwarf systems would suggest that the fraction of such objects  unaccounted by surveys and tsts ( too shy to shine )  is large .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by kormendy & freeman ( 2014,2015 ) in their investigation of the scaling laws of dark matter halos in late - type and dwarf spheroidal galaxies .    and the skies may be crowded with low mass halos , ready  like salpeter & hoffman s ( 1995a , b ) `` cheshire cat ''  to modestly shine .",
    "while the low redshift surveys provide measures of the fundamental relations between stars , atomic gas and dark matter in the current galaxy population , future efforts will aim to explore how the hi content evolves along with the stellar and molecular components over cosmic time . at the time of this review , we find the field of hi surveys poised to exploit new facilities offering huge advances in bandwidth and field of view , leading to a future revolutionary instrument , the square kilometre array . here",
    "we discuss the benchmarks that are likely to define the surveys that will take place in the next years and then by outlining representative ones that are on - going or planned as of now .",
    "new facilities are being designed or under construction , which will be used to carry out ambitious hi surveys in the next decade . in this section",
    "we briefly visit the announced characteristics of the telescopes and an even briefer one of some of the surveys which will dramatically expand our view of the hi universe .",
    "a useful parameter often used for the comparison of telescopes and surves is a figure of merit ( fom ) @xmath225 where @xmath226 is the telescope aperture efficiency , @xmath4 the system temperature of the receiver , @xmath227 is the solid angle of the telescope field of view and @xmath228 is its spectral bandwidth .    assume arbitrarily a unit fom corresponding to an arecibo - like telescope with an @xmath229 , a @xmath230 k and a single pixel field of view .",
    "then the same telescope operating over the same bandwidth with a 7-feed array and a degraded @xmath4 of 31 k , as would be the arecibo telescope with the alfa focal plane array , would have a @xmath231 .",
    "fast , an arecibo - like telescope currently under construction in southern china , will gain by a factor 3 in @xmath232 , and with a 19 feed planned focal plane array it should yield a fom@xmath233 , a huge gain over arecibo .",
    "meerkat , under construction in south africa , will be a `` traditional '' synthesis array of 64 antennas while apertiv and askap , respectively operating in holland and australia , will be arrays of between 24 and 36 telescopes , each getting a big kick in fom by the installation of focal plane phased arrays ( fppas ) in each of its antennas . while the @xmath4 performance of fppas is still somewhat uncertain , the multiplexing advantage of the fppa technology is extraordinary and should pay back handsomely .",
    "plans at arecibo and fast are also afoot for the construction of respectively 40 and 100 beams fppas . at these single dish facilities , optimizing the performance of a single fppa by , e.g. , cooling the unit , may allow achieving a @xmath4 below 50 k.    important concerns not contemplated by the fom as defined above include the impact of rfi and source confusion , as well as the fact that interferometric arrays will make it possible to spatially resolve hi sources out to much larger distances than will ao and fast .    as discussed in section [ rfi ] and above , rfi is a serious impediment as future surveys explore further into the universe and the redshifted hi line shifts to lower and lower frequencies where rfi threatens to become a limiting factor .",
    "interferometers are less prone to the impact of transient or time - varying rfi as the path length to individual elements of an array varies .",
    "however , receiver saturation will induce bad array data and therefore can have a serious impact even on interferometric surveys . while some telescope sites are located far from urban areas in `` radio quiet '' zones , satellite transmissions are increasingly rendering bands entirely unusable , regardless of earth location .",
    "alert monitoring , identification of rfi sources and legal protection are increasingly important .",
    "another critical issue for the design of future surveys to measure possible evolution of the hi mass function is the impact of source confusion ( duffy et al .",
    "2012 ; delhaize et al . 2013 ; jones et al .",
    "2015a , 2015b ) .",
    "while the addition of the velocity dimension reduces the impact of confusion on spectral line surveys , confusion will be particularly critical for future surveys with single dish telescopes like arecibo and fast .",
    "because of their large beams , confusion will start becoming a problem at moderate redshifts .",
    "source confusion may also constrain some of the future deep surveys with synthesis arrays , particularly if full angular resolution is not achieved . in general , the impact of confusion on the derivation of the hi mass function and its evolution with @xmath63 is to increase the derived value of the knee - mass m@xmath234 and to steepen the faint end slope @xmath204 .",
    "the fort of the large aperture single dishes will be the relatively nearby universe , where their sheer detection sensitivity will allow the detection of objects to very low hi mass , enabling studies of the faint end of the hi mass function to log m@xmath120/m@xmath235 .",
    "on the other hand , the wide shallow interferometric surveys wallaby and wnshs ( see table [ tab : skapathtab ] ) will be only negligibly affected by confusion .",
    "confusion will also have an impact on the potential of survey data bases to be mined with the stacking technique , as discussed in section [ stack ] .",
    "jones et al . ( 2015b ) show that the stacking potential of dingo udeep will be affected if askap is unable to achieve a resolution of 10   for that experiment . in principle",
    ", askap should be able to deliver the higher resolution if sufficient computational power is available to the dingo udeep program . due to their planned angular resolution , chiles and laduma ( see table [ tab : skapathtab ] )",
    "should be relatively unaffected by confusion .      in preparation for the deployment of the ska pathfinders ( arecibo - ao40 , fast , wsrt / apertif , askap and meerkat ) , a number of pilot programs to search for hi in emission at higher redshift have been recently undertaken or are underway .",
    "table [ tab : highztab ] summarizes the main characteristics of recent and on - going pilot studies which are opening the hi window into intermediate redshifts while the current plans for some of the pathfinder surveys are presented in table [ tab : skapathtab ] .      exploiting the huge collecting area of the arecibo telescope , the pointed highz program of catinella & cortese ( 2015 ) detected hi emission from 39 actively star - forming spirals at @xmath236 .",
    "the targets were selected from the sdss database on the basis of their optical morphology ( well formed , non - interacting disks ) and h@xmath204 line emission ( modest h@xmath204 equivalent width ) . as selected , these are relatively isolated , massive gas - rich disks , all with hi masses of @xmath237 , stellar masses @xmath238 , and sfrs of 3 - 35  yr@xmath2 .",
    "while they have unusually high hi gas fractions and very blue ( nuv - r ) colors , their gas content is _ not _ unusual given their uv and optical properties .",

    "unlike flux - limited hi emission line studies which are mass - limited at any distance and reflect both the cold and warm gas , absorption line detection is column - density limited ( at fixed continuum strength ) and therefore distance - independent and most sensitive to the cold gas in galaxies ( rao & briggs 1993 ) .",

    "table [ tab : skapathtab ] summarizes some of the representative ska pathfinder surveys as they are currently envisage .",
    "it should be noted that the final configurations and capabilities of the pathfinders are not yet set ; the parameters listed in table [ tab : skapathtab ] are current goals and may prove to be optimistic .",
    "however , all of them are likely to produce results in the next few years , taking advantages of the new capabilities now being deployed at these facilities , with first early science results already illustrating their scientific promise ( e.g. lucero et al . 2015 ; hess et al . 2015 ; serra et al .",
    "2015 ) . of particular note , the several planned deep surveys , in combination with major efforts at other wavelengths , will allow a first exploration of the evolution of the hi mass function over the the last few billion years , laying the groundwork for the next generation of surveys exploiting the square kilometer of collecting area promised by the full ska .    beyond the sheer numbers of detections , important studies of the hi morphologies and kinematics for thousands of galaxies will be enabled by these future surveys . among the pathfinders , the angular resolution of askap ( @xmath5330 ) and wsrt /",
    "apertif ( @xmath5315 ) will allow wallaby and wnshs to obtain maps with more than 10 beams across for 800 and 300 galaxies respectively , and more than 35,000 and 10,000 galaxies will be sampled over 3 - 10 beams , respectively . as a follow - on to the wsrt halogas survey probing to low column densities , ( heald et al .",
    "2011 ) , the mhongoose program will spend 200 hours per object staring at 30 nearby galaxies , delivering maps of unprecedented column density depth and probing the processes by which gas supplies are both depleted and replenished in spiral disks .",
    "at the time of writing of this review , plans for ska - mid , intended to be operational in the early 2020 s , suggest that some 1500 hours per year should be available for hi - related studies .",
    "a unique feature of the heterodyne techniques used in cm - wave astronomy is the potential for commensality , whereby the same acquired datastreams can be used simultaneously for both continuum and spectral line surveys ( i.e. , the data are acquired in spectral line mode and the continuum experiments sum the spectral channels ) .",
    "as has been the case for the execution of the alfa surveys at arecibo , there is very significant potential for commensality between future continuum and hi line surveys so that the amount of ska - mid telescope time available for hi science may be even larger . on - going activities of the ska",
    "pathfinders hi science coordination committee ( phiscc ) revolve around coordinating the planned surveys and sharing efforts to maximize scientific productivity ( oosterloo 2015 ) .",
    "these pathfinder surveys will only begin the exploration of the hi frontier at high redshift , allowing some quantitative input on the dominant form of gas  and even baryons  in the low mass , star forming population .",
    "the present review has focused on the outcome and plans for surveys of the hi content of individual galaxies or of aggregates of galaxies where stacking is employed .",
    "other compelling science is enabled by 21 cm hi line studies well beyond the limited scope of this review .",
    "most notable among them will be : the detection of the redshifted hi line from before and during the epoch of reionization ( e.g. paciga et al .",
    "2013 ; yatawatta et al . 2013 ; dillon et al .",
    "2014 ; jacobs et al .",
    "2015 ) ; intensity mapping to probe the evolution of the baryon acoustic scale length with a single probe over a wide range of redshift ( e.g. , chang et al . 2008 , 2010 ) ; and using hi measures of the rotational velocity in applications of the tully - fisher relation to derive the local peculiar velocity field ( e.g. koda et al . 2014 ; hoffman et al . 2015 ) .",
    "for many of these and further discussions , the reader is referred to the science documents associated with the ska science case ( e.g. , carilli & rawlings 2004 , a new version of which is in the process of being updated for which many white papers are available on the arxiv ) .",
    "ultimately , the construction of the full ska will enable the detection of billions of hi galaxies throughout the universe adding a vital ingredient to our understanding of how gas has been converted into stars throughout the history of the universe .",
    "we thank the entire alfalfa survey team for their many contributions over the last decade ( and more ) towards observing , data processing and analysis that have led to a rich alfalfa harvest .",
    "the alfalfa survey team at cornell has been supported by us nsf grants ast-0607007 and ast-1107390 to rg and mph and by continuing support from the brinson foundation ."
