    "symmetries of a dynamical system provide useful tools to understand its phase space structure and to simplify its description . in what follows ,",
    "we investigate , in a group theoretic setting , symmetries of toral automorphisms , i.e.  of matrices @xmath5 .",
    "this is similar in spirit to several recent publications @xcite where the ( discrete ) dynamical system , @xmath6 , is an element of some automorphism group , @xmath7 ( @xmath1 in our case ) .",
    "then , the group of _ symmetries _ of @xmath6 is the centralizer of @xmath6 in @xmath7 , defined as @xmath8    beyond a symmetry , one could also have a so - called _ reversing symmetry _ which maps @xmath6 to its inverse , @xmath9 .",
    "all such reversing symmetries , together with the symmetries , form another group , the _ reversing symmetry group _ of @xmath6 , @xmath10 if @xmath6 is an involution ( i.e.  @xmath11 ) or if @xmath6 admits no reversing symmetry , one has @xmath12 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath13 contains @xmath14 as a normal subgroup of index 2 .",
    "one can not expect to get a full characterization of the ( reversing ) symmetry group of an arbitrary automorphism @xmath6 .",
    "in special situations , however , a classification is possible .",
    "the latter is only necessary mod conjugacy , as @xmath15 . in our present context , for the cat maps",
    ", we are in the lucky situation of a matrix group , @xmath16 . since @xmath7 is not continuous , it is not surprising that methods from number theory are extremely handy to solve the puzzle .",
    "let us first investigate the structure of the symmetry group of a unimodular @xmath17-matrix .",
    "there are three types of matrices , called _ elliptic _ ( i.e.  of finite order ) , _ parabolic _",
    "( i.e.  eigenvalues @xmath18 , but not of finite order ) , and _ hyperbolic _ ( all remaining cases ) .",
    "the latter ones are the _ cat maps_. for the sake of completeness , the results will be given for _ all _ types of matrices , not just for the cat maps .",
    "before we actually state the result , let us briefly sketch how to get there .",
    "the case of elliptic and parabolic elements is most easily tackled by finding the corresponding conjugacy classes and by determining the corresponding symmetry groups for suitable representatives explicitly .",
    "then , the hyperbolic matrices have the property that their two eigenvalues are irrational and different from one another .",
    "one can then employ dirichlet s unit theorem from algebraic number theory , specialized to the case of quadratic number fields , to determine the corresponding unit groups and their relation to the symmetry groups , for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "the result is :    [ thm1 ] the structure of the centralizer of an element @xmath5 , i.e.  the structure of the symmetry group @xmath19 , has precisely one of the following forms : + 1 ) @xmath20 if and only if @xmath21 , + 2 ) @xmath22 if and only if @xmath23 and @xmath24 + ( i.e.  @xmath25 ) , + 3 ) @xmath26 if and only if @xmath23 and @xmath27 + ( i.e.  @xmath28 ) , + 4 ) @xmath29 if and only if @xmath30 and @xmath27 + ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) , or + 5 ) @xmath32 if and only if @xmath0 is not of finite order .",
    "case ( 5 ) needs some comment .",
    "if @xmath0 is not of finite order , it generates an infinite cyclic group of symmetries ( because @xmath0 commutes with any power of itself ) , and it trivially commutes with @xmath33 .",
    "this also gives a group of type @xmath34 , but it need _ not _ be @xmath19 because there could be a _ root _ of @xmath0 still inside @xmath1 .",
    "the non - trivial part of statement ( 5 ) is that , even if this happens , @xmath19 is still of type @xmath34  a direct consequence of dirichlet s unit theorem which also results in an explicit algorithm how to determine the generator of @xmath35 , see @xcite for details .",
    "at this point , we move on to the _ reversing _ symmetries . here",
    ", it turns out that all elliptic and all parabolic elements are reversible , i.e.  possess a reversing symmetry ( this is trivial for involutions , being their own reversing symmetry ) .",
    "this can again most easily be checked explicitly for the conjugacy class representatives . with the cat maps , however , things are more complicated .",
    "it is _ not _ true that all cat maps are reversible , and it is , in general , not easy to decide on reversibility versus irreversibility . before we come back to this point , let us , for the moment , just distinguish these two cases and classify the possible reversing symmetry groups . if a matrix @xmath0 is reversible , it can happen that there is a reversing symmetry of order 2 , or that the smallest order of a reversing symmetry is 4  resulting in different groups , @xmath36 .",
    "we obtain :    [ thm1a ] the structure of the reversing symmetry group @xmath37 of a matrix @xmath5 has precisely one of the following forms : + 1 ) @xmath38 if and only if @xmath21 , + 2 ) @xmath39 if and only if @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( i.e.  @xmath25 ) , + 3 ) @xmath40 if and only if @xmath23 and @xmath27 ( i.e.  @xmath28 ) , + 4 ) @xmath41 if and only if @xmath30 and @xmath27 ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) , + 5 ) @xmath42 if and only if @xmath0 is of infinite order and possesses a + reversing symmetry of order 2 , + 6 ) @xmath43 if and only if @xmath0 is of infinite order and possesses a + reversing symmetry of order 4 , but none of order 2 , or + 7 ) @xmath44 if and only if @xmath0 is of infinite order but irreversible .    here",
    ", @xmath45 is the dihedral group .",
    "let us add a comment on the structure of the reversing symmetry group in case ( 6 ) of the last theorem .",
    "it may look a bit astonishing that @xmath46 can still be written as a semi - direct product , but the reason for it is that the fourth order reversing symmetry @xmath47 fulfils @xmath48 , so by absorbing the @xmath49-part of the symmetry group @xmath50 we can find a subgroup of @xmath46 isomorphic to @xmath51 that conjugates the @xmath35-part into itself but has only the unit matrix in common with it .",
    "the next step of refinement would consist in a complete characterization of those cat maps that are reversible .",
    "there are two possibilities to proceed .",
    "one uses the fact that @xmath52 .",
    "then , reversibility of @xmath0 in @xmath1 ( i.e.  @xmath0 conjugate to @xmath53 ) can be reduced to various relations between elements of @xmath54 .",
    "the latter can be decided upon in finitely many steps because @xmath55 ( free product of two cyclic groups ) and the word problem is completely solvable there , see @xcite for details .",
    "another possibility uses a reformulation of the equation for reversibility in terms of an integer quadratic form and results in the question whether a certain integer can be represented by that form @xcite .",
    "this can then be decided by a finite algorithm which is the best type of result one may expect here .",
    "so far , we have analyzed ( reversing ) symmetries of @xmath5 .",
    "a power of @xmath0 could , in principle , have additional ( reversing ) symmetries , called _ ( reversing ) @xmath2-symmetries _ ( if valid for @xmath3 , but no smaller power of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the answer , however , is essentially negative .",
    "in fact , we have ( for @xmath56 ) :    elliptic elements of @xmath1 can not have ( reversing ) @xmath2-symmetries , unless @xmath57 , where @xmath58 .",
    "parabolic elements can not have any ( reversing ) @xmath2-symmetries .",
    "finally , hyperbolic elements can not have @xmath2-symmetries , and at most reversing 2-symmetries ( if @xmath24 , but @xmath59 reversible ) .",
    "the finite order and parabolic cases again rest upon the representatives of the conjugacy classes , while the rest follows from special properties of @xmath17-matrices and the cayley - hamilton theorem for them .",
    "another rather obvious extension concerns the class of transformations that one admits as symmetries . in particular , one could search for ( reversing ) symmetries of a toral automorphism within the larger group of _ affine _ transformations on the torus @xmath60 , giving the semi - direct product @xmath61 .",
    "this , indeed , gives rise to a number of interesting possibilities because of the following result ( where we write the affine transformations as @xmath62 with obvious meaning ) .",
    "the affine transformation @xmath62 is a ( reversing ) symmetry of the toral automorphism @xmath63 if and only if @xmath47 is a ( reversing ) symmetry of @xmath0 in @xmath1 and @xmath64 ( mod @xmath65 ) .",
    "let us remark that this also gives rise to ( reversing ) @xmath2-symmetries because @xmath66 has an increasing number of solutions on @xmath65 .",
    "they can be counted , provided no eigenvalue of @xmath3 is 1 , as @xmath67 .",
    "grouping them into orbits under the action of @xmath0 , one also relates this symmetry problem to the structure of dynamical or artin - mazur @xmath68-functions which might be an interesting side - remark .",
    "the above results also admit the full treatment of the corresponding problem for matrices in the projective linear group @xmath69 .",
    "one can read off the even simpler classification of possible ( reversing ) symmetry groups from theorems 1 and 2 , rederiving a result @xcite previously obtained directly ( though with similar techniques ) .",
    "what is more , theorem 3 has a counterpart where now even the possibility of reversing 2-symmetries vanishes , because all equations are now `` mod @xmath70 '' which makes many orientation reversing matrices actually reversible , compare @xcite .",
    "the interest in this case originates from the isomorphism between @xmath4 and the group of so - called nielsen trace maps @xcite .",
    "they are the ( invertible ) polynomial mappings of 3-space into itself that preserve the fricke-@xmath71vogt invariant @xmath72 and fix the point @xmath73 , the fibonacci trace map being its best - studied example .",
    "the surface @xmath74 is topologically a sphere with four punctures , and can be seen as the quotient of @xmath65 after @xmath75 ( i.e.  one identifies @xmath76 with @xmath77 on @xmath65 ) .",
    "this object still admits an affine extension , though only with a finite translation part ( isomorphic with klein s 4-group ) .",
    "this affine group in turn is isomorphic with the group of _ all _ polynomial mappings of 3-space that fix @xmath78  which gives this simple symmetry analysis a nice application in the context of nonlinear discrete dynamical systems .",
    "the structure of @xmath1 and its relation to algebraic number theory allowed for a complete classification of ( reversing ) symmetry groups of toral automorphisms , while the corresponding investigation of its projective counterpart , @xmath4 , gave the answer for the ( reversing ) symmetries of trace maps .",
    "it is , at this point , an obvious question how far this ( somehow exceptionally lucky ) situation can be generalized .",
    "the correspondence between integer matrices and algebraic number theory is , of course , not bound to @xmath17-matrices , so one can hope to get some results on @xmath79 .",
    "this is indeed possible for all matrices with _",
    "irreducible _ characteristic polynomial , employing again dirichlet s unit theorem @xcite .",
    "the cases with reducible polynomials , however , become increasingly nasty , and their symmetry groups are closely related to the crystallographic point groups in higher dimensions ",
    "so one should not expect a simple and general classification here .    as to the question of reversing symmetries ,",
    "the perspective is rather negative in the sense that reversibility will become more and more an exception with increasing dimension , because it implies that the spectrum is self - reciprocal ( i.e.  with @xmath80 also @xmath81 belongs to the spectrum ) .",
    "the latter is usually not the case for the set of algebraic conjugates of an algebraic integer which constitute the possible spectra of unimodular matrices .",
    "further results along these lines will be reported separately .",
    "it is my pleasure to thank john roberts for his cooperation , and the german science foundation ( dfg ) for financial support in form of a heisenberg fellowship .",
