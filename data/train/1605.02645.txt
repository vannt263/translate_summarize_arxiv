    "in recent years different methods @xcite have been proposed to map the structure and underlying dynamics of a given time series into an associated graph representation , with the aims of exploiting the modern tools of network science @xcite in the traditional task of time series analysis @xcite , thereby building a bridge between the two fields .",
    "+ in this context , visibility graphs have been proposed @xcite as a tool to extract a graph from the relative positions of an ordered series , from which several graph features can be extracted and used for description and classification problems .",
    "very recently we have advanced the concept of sequential visibility graph motifs @xcite , building on the idea of network motifs @xcite to explore the decomposition of visibility graphs into sequentially restricted subgraphs .",
    "these motifs induce a graph - theoretical symbolization of a given time series into a sequence of subgraphs .",
    "we have shown that the marginal distribution of the motif sequence -the so - called motif profile- is an informative feature to describe different types of dynamics and is useful in the task of classifying empirical time series . for large classes of dynamical systems , we were able to develop a theory to analytically compute the frequency of each motif when these are extracted from a so - called horizontal visibility graph ( hvg ) , this being a modified and simpler version of the original ( natural ) visibility graph ( vg ) which has often shown analytical tractability @xcite .",
    "as a matter of fact , in the case of vgs to obtain analytical insight has shown to be a challenging task , and besides few exception @xcite most of the works that make use of this statistic are computational . in this paper",
    "we bridge this gap and advance a theory to analytically compute the complete motif profile in the natural case ( vg motifs ) .",
    "we focus on motifs of size @xmath0 as this was shown to be the simplest case which gives nontrivial results @xcite .",
    "we validate this theory by deriving explicit motif profiles for several classes of dynamics which we show to be in good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "we also study the robustness of this feature when the time series is short and polluted with measurement noise , and compare its performance with the case of hvg motifs .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is as follows : after recalling the definitions of natural and horizontal visibility graphs , in section ii we present the concept and main properties of sequential visibility graph motifs , as well as recalling the theoretical framework where the motif profile from the horizontal version was derived . in section iii",
    "we focus on natural visibility and develop the theory to compute analytically the motif profile associated to processes where the dynamics are either bounded or unbounded .",
    "we test this theory by assessing the predictions for different dynamical systems , and we also show that white noise with different marginals can be distinguished using the natural version instead of the horizontal one . in section",
    "iv we show that the visibility graph motif profile is a robust feature in the sense of ( i ) having a fast convergence to asymptotic values for short series size @xmath1 and ( ii ) being robust against contamination with measurement noise ( white and colored ) . in section v we conclude .",
    "let @xmath2 be a real - valued time series of @xmath1 data .",
    "the natural visibility graph ( vg ) @xcite extracted from the series is the graph @xmath3 where each datum @xmath4 in the series is associated to a node @xmath5 ( thus @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a totally ordered set ) and an edge @xmath8 between node @xmath9 and node @xmath10 exists if @xmath11 $ ] for each @xmath12 such that @xmath13 .",
    "this is called the visibility criterion , which for the natural version is indeed a convexity criterion .",
    "analogously , the horizontal visibility graph ( hvg ) @xcite extracted from the series is the graph @xmath14 , with the same vertex set than @xmath15 and a smaller edge set @xmath16 , where an edge @xmath8 exists between nodes @xmath9 and @xmath10 if @xmath17 .",
    "this visibility criterion is in turn an ordering one .",
    "it was indeed shown that the hvg associated to a time series is invariant under monotonic transformations in the series @xcite , thus the hvg is an order statistic of the series .",
    "@xmath18 is indeed a non crossing graph @xcite which by construction is always also a sub - graph of @xmath19 ( although @xmath19 is not in general planar ) .",
    "both vg and hvg are connected graphs with a trivial hamiltonian path given by the sequence of vertices @xmath20 .",
    "an illustration of how to construct a vg and hvg from a given time series is shown in figure [ fig:0 ] .",
    "+ the set of sequential vg motifs of size @xmath21 , @xmath22 $ ] is defined as the set of all the @xmath23 possible sub - graphs with @xmath21 consecutive vertices along the hamiltonian path of a vg ( similarly , the set of hvg motifs of size @xmath21 is the set of all the @xmath24 admissible sub - graphs with @xmath21 consecutive vertices along the hamiltonian path of a hvg ) . accordingly ,",
    "sequential vg motifs are also visibility graphs . for @xmath0",
    ", there are in principle a total of @xmath25 possible motifs ( see table [ tab:1 ] for an enumeration ) , although as we will show below the number of admissible ones is just 6 . given a vg @xmath19 , its sequential motifs can be detected using a sliding window of size @xmath21 which slides along the hamiltonian path of the graph with @xmath26 consecutive overlapping steps . at each step a particular motif",
    "is detected inside the window .",
    "we can accordingly estimate @xmath27 , the frequency of appearance of a certain motif @xmath28 , and define the _",
    "n - motif profile _ @xmath29 .",
    "the process of extracting a vg / hvg and its sequential visibility motif set is illustrated in figure [ fig:1 ] ( the concept is analogous for hvg , although the set of admissible motifs is different in both cases ) . note that since @xmath30 can be understood as a discrete probability distribution and is therefore a vector with unit norm ( we use the @xmath31 norm here ) @xmath32 , the number of degrees of freedom of @xmath30 is @xmath33 ( again , as we will see below , in the case considered here it is even more reduced as the number of admissible motifs will be less than 8) .",
    "+    in a recent work @xcite we introduced the concept of sequential hvg motifs and advanced a theory to compute in an exact way @xmath34 in the case of the hvg .",
    "it was shown that the @xmath0 motif statistic was useful to discriminate across different types of dynamics .",
    "the case of uncorrelated noise was shown to yield a universal motif profile , independent of the marginal distribution of the i.i.d .",
    "process and this enabled the definition of randomness test .",
    "we also found for some deterministic dynamics some _ forbidden motifs _ , which represented a persistent characteristic to test the randomness of a process ( note that if a motif of size @xmath21 does nt occur , then also all the motifs of size @xmath35 which incorporate that motif wo nt occur either ) .",
    "since vg and hvg @xmath21 motif profiles are a temporally constrained feature ( they are evaluated along @xmath21 consecutive nodes on the hamiltonian path ) its extraction can be seen as a process of dynamic symbolization . under this perspective , the relation between hvg motifs of size @xmath0 and the so - called _ ordinal patterns _ ( ops ) @xcite was acknowledged in @xcite .",
    "@xmath21-ops are symbols extracted from a time series representing the possible ranking output of @xmath21 consecutive data and are extracted from a specific time series by comparing the value of all the set of @xmath21 consecutive data along the series @xcite .",
    "it was not unexpected to find a link between hvg @xmath21-motifs and @xmath21-ops as hvg is known to be an order statistic , much as ops .",
    "indeed , in the particular case of a time series for which data do nt repeat @xmath36 there exists a mapping between each appearing hvg motif and a specific set of ordinal patterns @xcite ; in this scenario the forbidden motifs selected by the horizontal visibility are , in general , set of the so called _ forbidden ordinal patterns _ @xcite .",
    "of course both vg and hvg motifs analysis can be applied without requiring any further assumption to time series taking values from finite sets ( namely when @xmath37 ) , while the ordinal patterns approach -based uniquely on the ranking statistics- require further assumptions in that case . here",
    "we focus in the _ natural _ version of the algorithm and explore vg motifs instead .",
    "as vgs are not invariant under monotonic transformations in the series @xcite , in general they depend on the marginal probability distribution of the time series and are not an order statistic . accordingly , there is no obvious correspondence between @xmath21-ops and vg @xmath21-motifs and both approaches in principle represent two independent symbolization methods that encode temporal information in a different way . in what follows we recall the theoretical framework for hvg motifs and in the next section we extend this theory to deal with vg motifs .",
    ".the set of size-4 hvg motifs are defined according to a set of relations between 4 arbitrary consecutive data @xmath38 , @xmath39 $ ] in the time series . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]        we start by considering the fully chaotic logistic map @xmath40 $ ] , with invariant density @xmath41 . as",
    "this process is deterministic , it fulfils a trivial markov property such that @xmath42 .",
    "the hvg motif profile for this process was computed exactly in @xcite , here we compute the vg motif profile . before proceeding to compute each probability contribution , it is important to highlight a subtle point . since for this process @xmath43 $ ] is bounded , in principle one should use the inequality set depicted for bounded variables in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "however , in this particular case it is actually not necessary to explicitly consider the restriction @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "as we will see in a moment , this is already taken into account implicitly in the computation of each integral and therefore one can use the ( simpler ) inequality set for unbounded variables given in table [ tab:1 ] . + we start by computing @xmath44 : @xmath45 which gives the following conditions : + @xmath46 + @xmath47 + which are satisfied for @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "note at this point that the latter conditions are also satisfied in other ranges , but we only consider those ranges that belong to @xmath49 $ ] , and this is indeed the reason why we do nt need to use in this case the inequality set for bounded variables .",
    "we thus have @xmath50}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\simeq0.0591\\ ] ]    as @xmath51 by construction , we proceed by calculating @xmath52 : @xmath53 which gives the following conditions : + @xmath54 + @xmath55 + which are satisfied for @xmath56\\cup[0.75,0.929]$ ] . therefore : @xmath57}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+b_{\\left[0.75,0.929\\right]}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right))\\simeq0.289.\\ ] ] similarly for @xmath58 we have @xmath59 which gives the following conditions : + @xmath60 + @xmath47 + which are satisfied for @xmath61 $ ] , and therefore @xmath62}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\simeq0.3333\\ ] ] for @xmath63 we have @xmath64 which gives the following conditions : + @xmath65 + @xmath55 + which are satisfied for @xmath66 $ ] , and thus @xmath67}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+b_{\\left[0.9239,0.9543\\right]}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\simeq0.0439\\ ] ] for @xmath68 we have @xmath69 which gives the following conditions : + @xmath70 + @xmath47 + which are never satisfied and thus @xmath71 for @xmath72 we have @xmath73 which gives the following conditions : + @xmath74 + @xmath55 + which are satisfied for @xmath75\\cup[0.9544,1]$ ] , and thus @xmath76}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right)+b_{\\left[0.95,1\\right]}\\left(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right))\\simeq0.2741\\ ] ] finally , by construction @xmath77 .",
    "altogether , we find the vg motif profile of a fully chaotic logistic map @xmath78 note that while the result is in this case an approximation , our theory allows for numerical estimates with arbitrary precision ( the result is not exact because the location of fixed points of the map is only approximate , although this approximation is arbitrarily close to the true values ) .",
    "for white uniform noise @xmath79 , @xmath80 $ ] we have a probability density @xmath81 and transition probability @xmath82 given by @xmath83 in this case the computations are more cumbersome since we need to make use of the inequality set for bounded variables described in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the @xmath28th component of @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 where the sum runs over all the set @xmath86 of conditions @xmath87 which contribute to evaluate the probability for motif @xmath28 in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "all the integrals can nonetheless be solved analytically in closed form and give the following motif profile @xmath88 several comments are in order .",
    "first , this profile is different from the one found for the chaotic logistic map .",
    "second , this motif profile turns to be independent from the bounding values @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 $ ] ) , meaning that white , uniform noise has a vg motif profile which is invariant under various transformations in the original distribution of the time series .",
    "this is not a trivial property and is indeed a peculiarity of the uniform distribution , in other words the vg motif profile of white noise extracted a from bounded distribution _ generally _ depends on the bounds of the distribution .",
    "for standard white gaussian noise @xmath79 , @xmath92 the probability density @xmath81 and transition probability @xmath82 are given by @xmath93 the @xmath28 component of @xmath84 is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 are now the top and bottom conditions for the variable @xmath96 in motif @xmath28 reported in table for unbounded variables [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the integrals can be evaluated numerically up to arbitrary precision and they give the following results @xmath97 at odds with what happens for hvg motifs @xcite , this result is different from the benchmark result for uniformly distributed white noise , thus there is not a universal vg motif profile for white noise as previously anticipated .",
    "gaussian colored ( red ) noise with exponentially decaying correlations can be simulated using an @xmath98 process : @xmath99 where @xmath92 is gaussian white , and @xmath100 is a parameter that tunes the correlation .",
    "the auto - correlation function @xmath101 decays exponentially @xmath102 , where the characteristic time @xmath103 .",

    "once set the parameter @xmath106 the profile can be evaluated numerically up to arbitrary precision ; here we give the profile for three possible values @xmath107 and @xmath108 @xmath109    in all these examples , theoretical results are in very good agreement with results obtained with numerical simulations reported in figure [ fig:1_2 ] .      differently from the hvg motifs , vg motifs statistics",
    "does not depend uniquely on the ranking statistics of the data and therefore the vg motif profile could be able in principle to discriminate white noises with different marginals . in the latter sections we have been able to distinguish between gaussian and uniform white noise . in figure [ fig:2 ]",
    "we summarize the motif frequencies @xmath110 of vg motifs forming @xmath34 , extracted from i.i.d .",
    "series with different marginals : @xmath111;\\quad f(x_i)\\sim1\\\\ \\text{gaussian}\\rightarrow x_i\\in(-\\infty,\\infty);\\quad f(x_i)\\sim\\frac{\\exp(-x_i^2/2)}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\\\ \\text{power - law}\\rightarrow x_i\\in[1,\\infty);\\quad f(x_i)\\sim x_i^{-k } , \\quad k= 2.5\\\\ \\text{exponential}\\rightarrow x_i\\in[0,\\infty);\\quad f(x_i)\\sim \\exp(-k x_i ) , \\quad k= 2.5\\\\ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in every case we extract series of @xmath112 data . the universal profile obtained for hvg is also plotted for comparison . as expected , motif profiles are different for different marginals .",
    "motifs which are symmetric to each other ( 3 and 4 , 5 and 6 ) occur with equal probabilities , something that does nt occur when the series is chaotic ( eq .",
    "[ log ] ) .      according to the values obtained for the components of @xmath34",
    ", one can extract some heuristic conclusions :    * @xmath113 , @xmath114 encode information on the marginal distribution of the process as well as its autocorrelation structure .",
    "* @xmath115 is null as this motif is not a vg .",
    "this is at odds with the hvg case , where this is an admissible motif provided the probability of finding consecutive equal data in the series is finite ( e.g. for discrete - valued series ) .",
    "* the motifs associated to the pairs ( @xmath116,@xmath117 ) ( @xmath118,@xmath119 ) have chiral symmetry .",
    "in other words , the motifs associated to @xmath116 and @xmath117 are isomorphic , the correct permutation being @xmath120 ( the same holds for @xmath118 and @xmath119 ) .",
    "accordingly , for any process which is statistically time reversible , we expect these probabilities to be equal .",
    "reversible processes include linear stochastic processes ( and both white and red noise belong to this family ) , while non - invertible chaotic processes are usually time irreversible ( the fully chaotic logistic map is an example ) .",
    "time irreversibility of the process is therefore encoded in these terms . *",
    "@xmath121 as this is not a vg and therefore does not appear ( not admissible ) .",
    "when dealing with empirical time series , the practitioner usually faces two different but complementary challenges , namely ( i ) the size of the series and ( ii ) the possible sources of measurement noise .",
    "the first challenge can be a problem when the statistics to be extracted from the series are strongly affected by finite - size effects , whereas for the second one needs to evaluate the robustness of those statistics against noise contamination . for a statistic or feature extracted from a time series to be not just informative but useful one usually requires that statistic or feature to be robust against both problems",
    ": it needs to have fast finite - size convergence speed and to be robust against reasonably large amounts of additive noise . + in @xcite it has been already shown that the hvg motif profile has good convergence properties respect to the series size @xmath1 and it is also robust respect to noise contamination . here",
    "we explore these very same problems for the case of the vg motif profile and we make a detailed comparison of its performance with the hvg motif profile in a range of situations .      in general , due to finite size effects , the estimated value of any feature fluctuates and deviates with respect to its asymptotic , expected value . for classical features such as the mean or the variance of a distribution ,",
    "these deviations are bounded and vanish with series size with a speed quantified by the central limit theorem .",
    "the estimation of the motif frequencies can be quantitative effected by finite - size fluctuations and one can even observe missing motifs ( motifs with estimated frequency @xmath122 ) which are not actually forbidden by the process but have not appeared by chance .",
    "this situation can be overemphasized in the presence of certain types of measurement noise . + following an approach analogous to the one followed for the forbidden ordinal patterns in @xcite ,",
    "we first perform a test to study the decay of missing motifs with the series size both in stochastic uncorrelated and correlated processes . in figure [ fig:3 ]",
    "panel a ) we plot @xmath123 , the average number of missing motifs in a series of size @xmath1 in the case of gaussian white noise and colored ( red ) gaussian noise ( for the red noise we consider the ar(1 ) process with correlation length @xmath124 discussed in section iii ) . for both types of noise @xmath123 decays exponentially to zero and already with a series of about 80 - 100 data points we can exclude the possibility of detecting missing motifs ( for both hvg and vg ) due to finite size fluctuations even in the case of correlated noise .",
    "+    as a second analysis , we explore the convergence speed of the estimated motif profile of uncorrelated and correlated stochastic series and of chaotic series ( fully chaotic logistic map ) of size @xmath1 to the asymptotic profile solution given in section iii . to do this we define the distance between the estimated @xmath125-motif probabilities @xmath126 and the asymptotic value @xmath127 .",
    "we use @xmath31 norm and accordingly define @xmath128 in figure [ fig:3 ] panel b ) we show the trend of @xmath129 in log - log scale ( results are averaged over 300 realizations ) .",
    "the average distance decreases like a power - law for all the processes considered , in agreement with a central - limit - theorem - like argument . for a series of @xmath130 points @xmath131 is less than @xmath132 and the average distance @xmath133 for each of the single components is less than @xmath134 ( not shown ) .",
    "these results suggest that vg and hvg motif profiles have very good convergence properties and are thus robust against finite size fluctuations .      to test and compare the robustness of vg and hvg motif profiles when the effect of noise contamination combines with the finite size fluctuations we consider the fully chaotic logistic map dynamics @xmath135 polluted with measurement ( additive ) noise @xmath136 @xmath137 in the two cases where @xmath136 is respectively white gaussian noise ( @xmath138 ) or colored gaussian noise ( @xmath124 ) . for both cases",
    "@xmath139 $ ] is the parameter which tunes the noise - to - signal ratio ( nsr ) of the process defined as @xmath140}{\\sigma^2[x]}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 $ ] and @xmath142 $ ] are respectively the theoretical variance of the white gaussian noise @xmath143 and the theoretical variance of the dynamics ( signal ) @xmath144 ( note that with this definition we are underestimating the nsr in the case of correlated noise where @xmath145=\\sigma^2[\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\cdot\\xi]/(1-r^2)$ ] ) .",
    "the robustness of the observed motif profile @xmath146 $ ] for a single realization of the process with given @xmath1 and @xmath147 can be defined as the distance between this profile and the theoretical profile @xmath148 $ ] of the noise @xmath149 for the given @xmath147 .",
    "@xmath150-\\phi^4_m[\\eta(\\alpha)]|.\\ ] ] with such definition we expect @xmath151 for low values of the nsr ( dominant signal , @xmath152\\simeq\\phi^4_m[x]$ ] ) and @xmath153 for high values of the nsr ( dominant noise , @xmath152\\simeq\\phi^4_m[\\eta]$ ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath154 is affected by finite size effects : if we assume to have few realizations @xmath155 of the process @xmath156 of small series size @xmath1 , then we expect the variance @xmath157 calculated over the realizations to be high .",
    "in particular we have to consider that a resolution limit @xmath158 exists , such that when @xmath159 we can not say any more if the distance we measured is discriminating the signal @xmath144 from the noise @xmath149 or it is simply due to finite - size effects of the contamination noise @xmath149 .",
    "we define this threshold @xmath158 as the sum of the standard deviations of the estimated profile components @xmath160 $ ] given @xmath155 realizations of the noise process alone @xmath161-\\langle\\hat{\\phi}^4_m[\\eta(n,\\alpha)]\\rangle_{n_r})^2\\rangle_{n_r}}\\ ] ] it is thus convenient to work with the relative distance @xmath162 ; when @xmath163 we say that the resolution limit for the process @xmath164 -given its @xmath155 realizations- is reached , and @xmath165 is not any more a reliable indicator .",
    "+ in figure [ fig:4 ] panel a ) we show the quantity @xmath166 averaged over 300 realizations of the process @xmath156 for different level of contamination nsr=@xmath167 $ ] at fixed size @xmath1=6400=@xmath168 ( notice that for @xmath169 we missing motifs are not found anymore ) respectively for white gaussian noise and colored gaussian noise and for the hvg and the vg motif profile .",
    "the red solid line represents the resolution limit threshold for the process .",
    "we can see that the hvg and the vg motif profiles are more robust respect to noise contamination when this noise is correlated .",
    "in this situation the hvg motif profile seems to perform better than the vg motif profile , while in the case of uncorrelated gaussian noise the vg profile seems in turn slightly more robust than the hvg profile .",
    "+ the last step of this robustness analysis is to consider the usual situation where only very few realizations ( often a single one ) of the same process are available .",
    "our aim is to define a useful indicator @xmath170 which estimates for any given value of the size @xmath1 the maximum amount of noise contamination level for which a measure @xmath171 computed with only one realization of the process @xmath156 can be considered somewhat reliable .",
    "we define this to be the value of the nsr such that @xmath172 , and thus @xmath173 @xmath174 measures ( in units of noise - to - signal ratio ) the ( statistical ) reliability of the motif profile extracted form a single time series of size @xmath1 of the signal @xmath144 in the presence of measurement noise @xmath149 . + in figure",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( panel a ) we plot @xmath175 for white gaussian noise in the case of vg by considering the @xmath176 curve marked by orange squares and by taking the smallest value of nsr for which an orange error bar intersect the red line ( the blue box highlights the region ) .",
    "wee find @xmath177 , meaning that when working with a single time series of the process @xmath156 with size @xmath178 , the @xmath179 distance measured by using the vg motif profile is reliable up to a level of white gaussian noise contamination @xmath147 such that @xmath180 . in figure [ fig:4 ] ( panel b )",
    "we report the estimated value of @xmath170 for the vg and hvg motif profiles in the case of white gaussian noise and correlated gaussian noise in function of the series size @xmath1=@xmath181 ( maximum noise contamination level considered was nsr(@xmath147)=8 ) .",
    "we can see that the motif profile is in general a robust measure respect to the combined effect of measurement noise and finite size : working with a single time series of only @xmath182 points of the process @xmath156 we can extract both the vg and the hvg motif profiles and expect those features to be informative respect to the underlying chaotic signal @xmath144 up to a level of measurement noise for which nsr=1.5 in the case of uncorrelated gaussian noise and nsr=3 in the case of correlated gaussian noise .",
    "+ also and as observed before ( figure [ fig:4]b ) ) , given the case of white gaussian noise contamination the vg motif profile ( orange squares ) seems to perform slightly better than the hvg motif profile ( green circles ) . for colored gaussian noise",
    "the situation is the opposite and the hvg motif profile ( reversed gray triangles ) performs much better ( almost a gap of one unit of nsr for @xmath183 ) than the vg motif profile ( blue triangles ) . for both type of visibility graphs the motif profile is coherently more robust when polluted with colored noise than with white noise .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that white noise breaks up the correlation structure of the signal faster ( respect to the size @xmath1 ) than correlated noise .",
    "it is also interesting that both types of motif profiles are very sensible to the noise correlations although the different nature of the visibility algorithms .",
    "sequential visibility graph motifs are small subgraphs where nodes are in consecutive order within the hamiltonian path that appear with characteristic frequencies for different types of dynamics . this concept was introduced recently @xcite and a theory was developed to analytically compute the motif profiles in the case of horizontal visibility graphs ( hvgs ) . in this work",
    "we have extended this theory to the realm of natural visibility graphs ( vgs ) , a family of graphs where the previous amount of known exact results was practically null .",
    "we have been able to give a closed form for the 4-node vg motif profile associated to general one dimensional deterministic and stochastic processes with a smooth invariant measure or continuous marginal distribution , for the cases where the variables belong to a bounded or unbounded interval . in the case where the time series is empirical and one",
    "does not have access to the underlying dynamics , the methodology still provides a linear time ( @xmath184 ) algorithm to estimate numerically such profile .",
    "we have shown that the theory is accurate and that vg motifs have similar robustness properties as hvg , yet they depend on the marginal distribution of the process and as such yield different profiles for different marginals .",
    "this is at odds with the results found for hvgs , where the motif profiles did not depend on the marginals as they behave as an order statistic .",
    "+ the detection of such motifs from a visibility graph extracted from a time series can be seen as a process of dynamic symbolization of the series itself , where the alphabet of symbols is composed by different subgraphs ( motifs ) which encode information about both data relations and their temporal ordering in their link structure . the deep similarity between hvg motifs and the so called ordinal pattern analysis -which holds mainly due to the fact that hvg is an order statistic- vanishes for vg motifs , which therefore stand as a complementary tool for time series analysis , specially relevant when the marginals play a role in the analysis ."
