    "<S> using a discrete model of 2-dimensional easy - plane classical ferromagnets , we propose that a rotating magnetic field in the easy plane can switch a vortex from one polarization to the opposite one if the amplitude exceeds a threshold value , but the backward process does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> such switches are indeed observed in computer simulations .    * switching between different vortex states in 2-dimensional easy - plane magnets due to an ac magnetic field *    2    there is a growing interest in non - equilibrium dynamics of quasi - two - dimensional magnetic materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many magnetic properties of these materials are well - described by the classical two - dimensional heisenberg model with easy - plane symmetry . in this model </S>",
    "<S> vortices play a very important role . </S>",
    "<S> they cause a topological phase transition @xcite , and they contribute to the so - called central peaks in inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite that arise from the translational motion of vortices @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of static vortex solutions , depending on the anisotropy strength @xmath0 ( see below ) of the heisenberg exchange interaction @xcite : in - plane vortices for which all spins lie in the easy @xmath1-plane , and out - of - plane vortices which exhibits a localized structure of the @xmath2-components of the spins around the vortex center . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the vorticity @xmath3 , the out - of - plane vortices have a second topological charge @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is denoted as  polarization  because its sign determines the side of the @xmath5plane to which the out - of - plane vortex structure points .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present letter is to investigate the internal dynamic of the vortices in the discrete two - dimensional heisenberg ferromagnet in the presence of an ac magnetic field in the easy - plane . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that switching between vortex states with different polarization occurs if the amplitude of the field is larger than a threshold value .    </S>",
    "<S> the easy - plane hamiltonian for classical spins @xmath6 located on sites @xmath7 of a quadratic lattice has the form @xmath8 where @xmath0 is the anisotropy parameter ( @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the exchange constant and @xmath11 is the vector which connects a site with nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is the on - site magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> in what follows we set @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known @xcite that for @xmath15 where the critical value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath16 depends on the lattice type(e.g . for square lattices </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 ) the in - plane vortex with @xmath18 and the azimuthal angles @xmath19 satisfying the equation @xmath20 , is stable . for @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane vortex becomes unstable and an out - of - plane vortex is created . </S>",
    "<S> it exhibits a localized structure of the @xmath22 components around the vortex center . in the case of a circular system of the radius @xmath23 with free boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal angles @xmath19 for both types of vortices are approximately given by @xmath24 where a constant phase has been omitted . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the coordinates of the vortex center , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are the coordinates of the `` image''-vortex . in the case of fixed boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> the sign in front of the second term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ az ] ) is reversed .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested here in the vortex dynamics under the influence of a spatially uniform in - plane ac magnetic field @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of the field with the spin system has the form @xmath31 the spin dynamics is described by the landau - lifshitz equation    @xmath32    the last terms in eqs ( [ lln ] ) represent damping @xcite .    to clarify the behavior of out - of - plane vortices in the presence of the ac field , we have numerically integrated the landau - lifshitz equation ( [ lln ] ) for a large square lattice in which we cut out a circle with radius @xmath33 using both free and fixed boundary conditions with @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> we used relatively weak ac fields so as not to change the ground state significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the integration time was 12,000 time units with time step 0.01 . </S>",
    "<S> first we used an out - of - plane vortex with polarization p=1 as the initial condition and a clockwise rotating magnetic field with the frequency @xmath35 : this is close to the frequency of the lowest radially symmetric eigenmode in the presence of a vortex @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that for all @xmath36 the vortex with p=1 remains the stable configuration but for @xmath37 a flip to the state with the opposite polarization ( @xmath38 ) occurs ( fig 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> using the same initial condition but changing the direction of rotation of the magnetic field ( @xmath39 ) we observed the switching only when @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> but in contrast to the previous case when the vortex after switching had a well - defined core structure , now the out - of - plane structure is almost completely destroyed by spin waves .    </S>",
    "<S> another set of simulations was performed using a static out - of - plane vortex state with the same @xmath41 but polarization @xmath38 as initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the flip occurs only for a counter - clockwise rotating magnetic field @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the results of extensive simulations may be summarized as follows for both types of boundary conditions :    * flips between oppositely polarized states take place under the action of the ac magnetic field when @xmath43 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> * the threshold value @xmath44 depends on the product @xmath45 and not on the vorticity . the threshold value in the case when the polarization vector is anti - parallel to the angular velocity vector @xmath46 is much smaller than when these vectors are parallel . </S>",
    "<S> * flips are uni - directional . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath47 , the final state is characterized by a well - defined core structure , while for @xmath48 the core structure is destroyed .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic reason for the switching can be easily understood by using the frame of reference which rotates together with the magnetic field . in this frame </S>",
    "<S> there exists an inertial force equivalent to a magnetic field aligned along the angular velocity @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> then the vortex states with different polarization are nonequivalent and switching processes become energetically favored . </S>",
    "<S> this can not explain , however , why the threshold of the switching is a non - monotonic function of the frequency @xmath50 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . to gain deeper insight </S>",
    "<S> we need in a reduced form of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) which takes into account both types of vortices : in - plane and out - of - plane . as a topological charge,@xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> is conserved in the continuum limit only . </S>",
    "<S> thus the switching between states with different polarization is due to lattice discreteness .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the near - critical case @xmath51 when the out - of - plane spin deviations @xmath22 are small , and assume also smooth dependence of the deviations @xmath52 from the static vortex structure on the spatial variable @xmath53 . in this case , applying the transformation @xmath54 where the coefficients @xmath55 satisfy the set of equations @xmath56 we transform the harmonic part of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) obtained in the vicinity of the static in - plane vortex , @xmath57 to the principal axis coordinates @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> in refs @xcite the linear eigenmodes of the easy - plane ferromagnet with hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in the presence of a vortex were investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest radially symmetric mode , which is localized near the vortex center and describes the in - phase motion of the core spins , becomes soft when @xmath0 approaches @xmath16 . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> this mode is responsible for the in - plane vortex instability .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding eigenvalue , say @xmath59 , becomes negative when @xmath60 : @xmath61 with @xmath62 a numerical coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> inserting the transformation ( [ trans ] ) into the hamiltonian @xmath63 and keeping only the soft eigenmode @xmath64 , we obtain an effective soft - mode hamiltonian @xmath65 where terms @xmath66 and @xmath67 which are unimportant in the near - critical case and all higher order terms have been omitted . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 is a positive constant .    </S>",
    "<S> we see from eqs ( [ int ] ) and ( [ az ] ) that a spatially uniform in - plane magnetic field can not excite the radially symmetric soft mode when the vortex is situated at the center of the system . </S>",
    "<S> switching can occur only as a result of nonlinear mixing between the radially symmetric mode and non - symmetric vortex modes which do interact with the spatially uniform alternating external field . </S>",
    "<S> this may take place in large systems where the motion of the vortex is frozen @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in a relatively small , finite system with free boundary conditions the vortex is attracted by its image and moves along an unwinding spiral trajectory ( see e.g. @xcite ) towards the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical experiments do show that switching events in general occur only when vortex is at a finite distance from the center . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex center motion is very slow ( with a frequency @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> so we can consider the switching process with fixed vortex position , say @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> inserting eqs ( [ trans ] ) and ( [ az ] ) into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int ] ) and assuming that the vortex is far from the boundaries ( @xmath71 ) , we find that the effective interaction of the in - plane ac magnetic field with the soft mode : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . an effective interaction of the same form can be obtained by taking into account the fact that the vortex structure is velocity dependent @xcite and symmetric about the direction of the vortex motion . </S>",
    "<S> the constant phase shift ( @xmath75 ) plays no essential role and was omitted .    from eqs </S>",
    "<S> ( [ effh ] ) and ( [ inte ] ) we find that in the soft mode approach the dynamics is governed by @xmath76 here the nonlinear terms @xmath77 and @xmath78 have been neglected . </S>",
    "<S> an example of the core dynamics based on eqs ( [ core ] ) is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . these results are in good agreement with those from the numerical integration of the full landau - lifshitz equations ( [ lln ] ) .    to clarify the physical meaning it is convenient to write the set of equations ( [ core ] ) as a single equation for @xmath79 . near the threshold ( @xmath80 ) , in the limit of small damping ( @xmath81 ) , and for a not too strong amplitude of the external magnetic field ( @xmath82 ) </S>",
    "<S> we obtain from eqs ( [ core ] ) an effective equation for @xmath79 @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the vortex core dynamics is analogous to the dynamics of a particle in a double - well potential under the action of direct and parametric forces.in order to estimate @xmath44 we use a heuristic approach proposed by moon @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the switching occurs when the particle reaches the maximum velocity on the homoclinic orbit . considering the particle motion in the potential well centered at @xmath84 and using multiple - scale analysis for small @xmath85 , @xmath41 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the frequency of harmonic oscillations near the bottom of the well , we find @xmath88 , with @xmath89 the maximum velocity on the homoclinic orbit is @xmath90.the switching occurs when @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is an empirical parameter.from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ est ] ) we find @xmath93 in the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition ( [ crit ] ) is in agreement with the results of numerical simulations : the function @xmath96 has minima near the frequency of the soft mode @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> it is highly asymmetric ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . for small amplitudes of the counter - clockwise rotating magnetic field ( @xmath42 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the switching condition @xmath37 can be fulfilled only for the vortex with initial polarization @xmath38 , while for a clockwise rotating field the condition can be fulfilled for the vortex with opposite polarization @xmath98 . qualitatively the same results may be obtained by using the melnikov function approach @xcite .    in conclusion , we have shown that the polarization of out - of- plane vortices in easy - plane ferromagnets can be changed by applying an ac magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> flips occur more easily when the polarization of the vortex is anti - parallel to the angular velocity @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it can take place only in discrete systems , and they are uni - directional events . </S>"
