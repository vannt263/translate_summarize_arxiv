    "we rely crucially on deligne s equidistribution theorem that provides it ( as a very special case ) , as well as on algebraic properties of the monodromy group .",
    "for kloosterman sums , as we mentioned , we can also use average over the additive character to get convergence in law :    [ th - main3 ] for @xmath3 prime , @xmath66 , let @xmath67 denote the continuous function interpolating the partial sums @xmath68    the processes @xmath69 on the probability spaces @xmath70 converge to the process @xmath31}$ ] in the sense of convergence in law in @xmath43)$ ] .",

    "in particular , the two limits exist , and in fact they are equal .",
    "as we will clearly see , convergence of finite distributions and tightness are valid in great generality for many processes corresponding to partial sums of one - variable exponential sums .",
    "they follow naturally from two important properties :    \\(1 ) computation and properties of the _ monodromy group _ of certain families of exponential sums ( these are the kloosterman sums for theorems  [ th - main ] and  [ th - main3 ] , and the birch sums for theorem  [ th - main2 ] , but other cases lead to slightly different sums ) .",

    "such sums are at the edge of the so - called _ plya - vinogradov range _ , which refers to @xmath81 a bit larger than @xmath83 , and which can be treated in considerable generality .",
    "the first ingredient is exceptionally deep : it involves all of deligne s work on the riemann hypothesis over finite fields  @xcite , as well as many additional algebraic and geometric results .",
    "the second ingredient is also very delicate , and is not currently known in great generality , although one can certainly conjecture that it should be true under very general conditions .",
    "( it is , at the current time , not known for kloosterman sums when averaging only over @xmath1 , which is the reason that theorem  [ th - main3 ] requires additional averaging over the additive character ) .",
    "it is a very appealing and striking feature of this work that it shows how these two arithmetic aspects of exponential sums are unified to contribute to a single clear conclusion .",
    "since both properties are very important in many applications in different ways , this is quite an interesting phenomenon .",
    "in fact , some sporadic relations between these two types of properties have already appeared ( e.g. , in the proof of burgess s bounds for short character sums , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * th .",

    "none is , as far as we know , as direct and clearly focused as the phenomenon that we present .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec - finite ] , we present the proof of theorem  [ th - main ] , and more generally of convergence of finite distributions for the situation of theorem  [ th - main2 ] ( and potentially many other cases , possibly for a different random fourier series than @xmath84 ) . in section  [ sec - tight ] , we address the additional condition of tightness , and relate it to short exponential sums . in section  [ sec - applis ] ,",
    "we give applications , especially proving theorem  [ th - tails ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - other ] we make a few remarks concerning other potential cases of convergence in law of paths of exponential sums , as well as concerning a few earlier works that have some similarity with this paper ( besides those of loxton already mentioned ) .",

    "the convergence almost surely , hence in law , of the series for any fixed @xmath128 is an immediate consequence of kolmogorov s @xmath129-series theorem , together with the fact that the sato - tate measure has mean @xmath130 and is compactly supported .",
    "the other results , however , are most easily derived as consequences of general facts about random fourier series , which we quote from the work  @xcite of kahane .",
