    "a class of dissipative effects that can enter the energy - momentum tensor without spoiling the isotropy of the background geometry can be parametrized in terms of a bulk viscosity coefficient @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in the relativistic theory of imperfect fluids , the dissipative effects can be parametrized in terms of a shear coefficient , a heat flow coefficient and a bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "when written in general coordinates @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the contributions of the shear tensor and of the heat flow ( unlike the bulk viscosity ) do not contribute to a homogeneous and isotropic background geometry of friedmann - robertson - walker type @xcite .",

    "@xcite , for a _ single _ fluid , the total energy - momentum @xmath0 tensor can then be split into a perfect contribution , denoted in the following by @xmath1 , and into an imperfect contribution , denoted by @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 in general coordinates , and within our set of conventions , the contribution of bulk viscous stresses can be written , in turn , as @xmath4 where @xmath5 represents the bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "the presence of bulk viscosity can also be interpreted , at the level of the background , as an effective redefinition of the enthalpy ( i.e. @xmath6 ) that appears both in the spatial components of einstein equations and in the background form of the covariant conservation equation .",
    "while this approach may be appropriate at the level of the evolution of the background space - time , it could be confusing if applied to the dynamics of the fluctuations when @xmath5 is allowed to have a spatial dependence .",

    "these deflationary solutions @xcite violate , initially , the strong energy condition , i.e. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total pressure and @xmath11 is the pressure arising from the perfect contribution ( i.e. @xmath12 ) introduced in eq .",
    "( [ bv1 ] ) . the dominant energy condition @xcite could be violated when bulk viscous stresses are added @xcite .",
    "this second occurrence implies that the effective enthalpy , i.e. @xmath13 , may not always be positive - definite in all the classes of solutions involving a homogeneous ( viscous ) background .",
    "boundary conditions can be imposed in such a way that for @xmath14 the solution approaches , asymptotically , de sitter space - time . in the latter case",
    "the solutions are driven to an inflationary phase @xcite .",
    "barrow @xcite presented detailed studies ( see also @xcite ) on inflationary universes driven by a gas of strings showing that , in some regimes , this system can be dicussed in terms of an effective bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "the solutions quoted in the previous paragraphs have been generalized along different lines . in @xcite",
    "the bulk viscosity coefficient @xmath5 is taken to be proportional to a power of the energy density , i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "the relevance of these examples for the cosmic no - hair theorems has also been investigated in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "moreover it was argued that , as one traces the universe back in time , a point is reached when the expansion rate is so fast that the rate of string creation due to quantum effects balances the dilution of the string density due to the expansion @xcite .",
    "these considerations lead naturally to an effective bulk viscosity coefficient that may induce an approximate , weak , inflationary dynamics .",
    "the possibility of driving a robust inflationary phase by means of bulk viscous stresses has been indeed criticized on various grounds ( see @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "it has been argued that the bulk viscosity effects associated with a gas of weakly interacting particles can not make the pressure negative excluding any form of inflation . in @xcite",
    "it has been suggested that hydrodynamic inflation is intrinsically problematic ( see also @xcite for an interesting , related perspective ) since while the inflationary evolution requires a very small expansion time the hydrodynamic regime requires a very small interaction time .",
    "therefore , to treat consistently the problem one would need a consistent ( non - linear ) generalization of the israel - stewart transport equations ( see the attempt of ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as a consistent model of fluid behaviour under super - rapid expansion and strongly non - linear conditions . the possibility of realizing a sufficiently long and robust inflationary phase is , however , not central for the present analysis : in the present context the possible effects of bulk viscosity will arise after the end of a ( conventional or unconventional ) inflationary phase .",
    "the effect of bulk viscous stresses has also been studied in the case of scalar - tensor theories of gravity ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the possible implications of bulk viscosity on the dynamics of the dark energy fluid have been investigated in different frameworks @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite the hope is to obtain naturally an accelerated expansion from bulk viscous effects .",
    "an apparently unrelated effect is the energy exchange between different fluids whose mixture constitutes the global relativistic plasma that drives the evolution of the geometry . for instance , it is conceivable that , after inflation , the oscillating inflaton field decays into massless particles @xcite .",
    "then this situation can be modelled by a fluid of dusty matter decaying into a fluid of radiation .",
    "multifluids also arise is the discussion of isocurvature modes like , for instance , the cdm - radiation isocurvature mode . in all these problems ,",
    "one of the relevant aspects is the analysis of the evolution of curvature and entropy perturbations .",
    "the theory of cosmological perturbations in the presence of different fluids has a long history .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the problem of multifluids was analysed in the absence of bulk viscosity . in @xcite multifluid systems",
    "have been treated in the framework of a covariant cosmological perturbation ( see @xcite for an introduction and @xcite for related applications ) .",
    "entropy perturbations arising in multifluid systems have also been discussed in @xcite in the context of the bardeen formalism @xcite , as well as in the context of inflationary models @xcite and quintessence models @xcite .",
    "possible effects connected with the decay of the inflaton have recently been considered in @xcite .",
    "notice finally that earlier works in the general area of bulk viscosity can be found in @xcite .",
    "it has been argued , in recent years , that interacting ( multiple ) fluids may play some relevant rle in cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "if the early universe contains more than a single fluid , the spatial variations of the decay rate may indeed generate curvature perturbations @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .    in the present paper a unified description of imperfect fluids",
    "is developed with the aim of understanding if and how the effect of spatial fluctuations in the bulk viscosity coefficient ( combined with a non - vanishing decay rate ) may induce super - horizon curvature perturbations . in this sense , we are not interested in discussing the evolution of the fluctuations in the case when a _",
    "single _ viscous fluid is present .",
    "let us phrase the problem in physical terms .",
    "consider the situation where the matter content of the universe is formed by , at least , _ two fluids_. the possible dissipative effects compatible with the isotropy of the background geometry are :    * energy exchange between the fluids ; * bulk viscous effects associated with each fluid and with the mixture .",
    "the first type of efffect can be parametrized by a ( time - dependent ) decay rate that is allowed to fluctuate spatially .",
    "these fluctuations may then induce fluctuations on super - horizon scales ( see , again , @xcite ) .",
    "the second type of effects can be parametrized by the appropriate second viscosity coefficients of each fluid of the mixture and by their related fluctuations .",
    "also in this case it is reasonable to expect that the fluctuations of the second viscosity coefficient can be converted into super - horizon curvature fluctuations .",
    "there may be , in principle , two extreme situations .",
    "in one case the presence of bulk viscous stresses crucially determines the nature of the background geometry .",
    "this is the approach studied , for instance , in @xcite . in the other situation",
    ", the bulk viscosity does not determine crucially the properties of the background geometry .",
    "this approach is hard to justify for a single ( non decaying ) viscous fluid , but it becomes plausible when there are at least two interacting fluids .",
    "consider , for instance , the situation where the fluid describing the decay products has no intrinsic viscosity , while the fluid that is effectively decaying has some intrinsic viscosity . if , as in @xcite , @xmath5 depends on the energy density of the decaying fluid , it reasonable to expect that when the decay is completed , the bulk viscous effects will also decay .",
    "depending on the specific parameters of the example , it is then conceivable that , the net result of the evolution will be a single inviscid fluid supplemented by an exponentially decaying ( viscous ) component with negligible effect on the dynamics of the background .",
    "it is interesting to understand what happens to the dynamics of the fluctuation .",
    "if the decaying fluid has some intrinsic viscosity , the effect on the curvature fluctuations may be relevant even if , when the decay is completed , the viscous contribution goes exponentially to zero at a rate that depends upon the relative interaction of the fluids of the mixture .    from a more formal point of view ,",
    "one of the problems is a full gauge - invariant treatment of imperfect cosmological perturbations where the fluctuations of both the bulk viscosity coefficient and the decay rate are invariant under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms .",
    "the gauge - invariant approach will be complemented with gauge - fixed descriptions that are particularly useful in connection with the intricacy of the numerical calculations .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the basic framework of the analysis will be illustrated .",
    "section 3 contains the gauge - invariant description of cosmological perturbations in the presence both of a fluctuating decay rate and of a fluctuating bulk viscosity coefficient . in section 4",
    "the gauge - invariant evolution equations for the curvature perturbations will be introduced , while in section 5 curvature perturbations will be discussed in the context of a gauge - fixed description .",
    "section 6 contains various numerical examples clarifying the interplay between fluctuating bulk viscosity and fluctuating decay rate .",
    "finally , section 7 contains the summary of the main findings and the concluding discussions . for completeness , the analysis of the evolution of the vector modes has been included in an appendix .",
    "some physical quantities relevant to the problem at hand will now be introduced . as already pointed out ,",

    "it has been shown that situations can be envisaged where the contribution of the bulk viscosity coefficient becomes subleading after the decay of the viscous fluid of the mixture . in this case , the curvature fluctuations for length scales larger that the hubble radius are determined by the interplay of the fluctuating viscosity and of the inhomogeneous decay rate .",

    "for completeness , some results concerning the evolution of vector modes in a mixture of viscous interacting fluids are reported in the present appendix .",
    "they are not central to the present analysis , but are logically connected to the considerations presented so far . in fact , one may wonder if effects similar to the ones discussed for the scalar modes may also arise in the case of vector modes .",

    "they are parametrized by two ( solenoidal ) three - dimensional vectors @xmath239 and @xmath240 which have , overall , three independent components : @xmath241 where @xmath242 denotes the vector fluctuation of the various entries of the perturbed metric .",
