    "the confirmation of the neutrino oscillation interpretation of solar and atmospheric neutrino data by reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments brings a unique picture of neutrino physics in terms of three - neutrino oscillations  @xcite , leaving little room for other non - standard neutrino properties  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has long been recognized that any gauge theory of neutrino mass generation inevitably brings in dimension-6 non - standard neutrino interaction ( nsi ) terms .",
    "such sub - weak strength operators arise in the broad class of seesaw - type models , due to the non - trivial structure of charged and neutral current weak interactions  @xcite .",
    "similarly , nsi also appear in radiative models of neutrino mass .",
    "they can be of two types : flavor - changing ( fc ) and non - universal ( nu ) and their strength @xmath5 is highly model - dependent but may lie within the sensitivities of currently planned experiments .",
    "the presence of nsi leads to possibly new resonant effects in the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos  @xcite and it is interesting to scrutinize their possible role in the propagation of laboratory neutrinos . with neutrino oscillation physics entering the precision age  @xcite",
    "it becomes an important challenge to investigate the role of nsi in future terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the interplay of oscillation and neutrino non - standard interactions ( nsi ) was studied in  @xcite and subsequently it was shown  @xcite that in the presence of nsi it is very difficult to disentangle genuine oscillation effects from those coming from nsi .",
    "the latter may affect production , propagation and detection of neutrinos and in general these three effects need not be correlated .",
    "it has been shown that in this case cancellations can occur which make it impossible to separate oscillation from nsi effects .",
    "subsequently it was discovered that the ability to detect @xmath0 may be crucial in order to overcome that problem  @xcite , though this method requires sufficiently large beam energies to be applicable . barring the occurrence of fine - tuned cancellations , nsi and",
    "oscillations have very different @xmath4 dependence .",
    "therefore , combining different @xmath4 can be very effective in probing the presence of nsi .",
    "the issue of nsi and oscillation in neutrino experiments with terrestrial sources has been studied in a large number of publications  . in",
    "@xcite it was shown that minos  @xcite on its own is not able to put new constraints on nsi parameters .",
    "on the other hand , in  @xcite the combination of atmospheric data with minos was proven to be effective in probing at least some of the nsi parameters . since matter effects are relatively small in minos , its main role in that combination is to constrain the vacuum mixing parameters .",
    "the question we would like to address here is whether the combination of minos and opera  @xcite can provide useful information on nsi .",
    "opera has recently seen the first events in the emulsion cloud chamber  @xcite and hence it appears timely to ask this question .",
    "the idea is that opera will be able to detect @xmath0 and has a very different @xmath4 than minos .",
    "both factors are known to help distinguishing nsi from oscillation effects .",
    "clearly , much larger improvements on existing sensitivities are expected from superbeam experiments like t2k  @xcite and no@xmath6a  @xcite especially in combination with reactor neutrino experiments like doublechooz  @xcite or daya bay  @xcite , see ref .  @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will focus on the simple case where nsi only affects neutrino propagation .",
    "adding nsi into the propagation of neutrinos yields the following evolution hamiltonian @xmath7 where we have made use of the fact that all @xmath8 are fairly well constrained and hence are expected not to play a significant role at leading order .",
    "the effect of @xmath9 is a re - scaling of the matter density and all experiments considered here are not expected to be sensitive to matter effects .",
    "hence we will set @xmath10 .",
    "note , that the @xmath11 as defined here , are effective parameters . at the level of the underlying lagrangian describing the nsi",
    ", the nsi coupling of the neutrino can be either to electrons , up or down quarks . from a phenomenological point of view , however , only the ( incoherent ) sum of all these contributions is relevant . for simplicity , we chose to normalize our nsi to the electron abundance .",
    "this introduces a relative factor of 3 compared to the case where one normalizes either to the up or down quark abundance ( assuming an isoscalar composition of the earth ) , _ i.e. _ the nsi coupling to only up or down quark would need to be 3 times as strong to produce the same effect in oscillations . since both conventions can be found in the literature , care is required in making quantitative comparisons .",
    "there are two potential benefits beyond adding statistics from combining the data from minos and opera : first , opera can detect @xmath0 which , in principle , allows to directly access any effect from @xmath12 . moreover , although the baseline is the same , the beam energies are very different @xmath13 for minos , whereas @xmath14 for opera .",
    "all numerical simulations have been done using the globes software  @xcite . in order to include the effects of the nsi we have customized the package by adding a new piece to the hamiltonian as shown in equation  [ eq : hamiltonian ] .",
    "we have considered three different experiments : minos , opera and doublechooz , the main characteristics of which are summarized in table  [ tab : exp ] .",
    ".[tab : exp ] main parameters of the experiments under study . [ cols=\"<,>,^,<,>,^,^,>,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this letter we have studied how opera can help in improving the sensitivities on neutrino non - standard contact interactions of the third family of neutrinos . in our analysis",
    "we considered a combined opera fit together with high statistics minos data , in order to obtain restrictions on neutrino oscillation parameters in the presence of nsi .",
    "due to its unique ability of detecting @xmath0 one would expect that the inclusion of opera data would provide new improved limits on the universality violating nsi parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we found , however , that the @xmath0 data sample is too small to be of statistical significance .",
    "this holds even if we double the nominal exposure of opera to @xmath16 .",
    "opera also has a @xmath1 sample , which can help constraining nsi . here",
    "the effect is due to the very different @xmath4 of opera compared to minos .",
    "this makes the opera @xmath1 sample more sensitive to nsi .",
    "however , the improvement is small and happens in a part of the nsi parameter space which is essentially excluded by atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "we have also studied the possibility of constraining the fc nsi parameter @xmath17 . for this purpose",
    "it is crucial to have a good knowledge of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , we included future doublechooz data , since reactor neutrino experiments are insensitive to the presence of nsi of the type considered here .",
    "therefore , reactor experiments can provide a clean measurement of @xmath18 , which in turn can be used in the analysis of long baseline data to probe the nsi .",
    "doublechooz is only the first new reactor experiment and more accurate ones like daya bay or reno will follow",
    ". our result would be qualitatively the same if we would have considered those , more precise , experiments , but clearly the numerical values of the obtained bounds would improve .",
    "the conclusion for @xmath17 with respect to the @xmath0 sample is the same as before : the sample is very much too small to be of any statistical significance . opera s",
    "different @xmath4 again proves to be its most important feature and allows to shrink the allowed region on the @xmath19-@xmath17 plane for large @xmath18 values . here",
    "a modest increase in opera exposure would allow to completely lift the @xmath18-@xmath17 degeneracy and thus to obtain a unique solution .",
    "we would like to thank c. hagner for useful information about the opera experiment .",
