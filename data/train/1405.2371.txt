    "the dynamics is governed by long range correlations and not by the details of the interaction between the constituents . when a universal class is identified all systems belonging to this class can be described equally well by a model in which this particular phenomenon is implemented . as an example we can mentioned the ising model to study phase transitions .    here",

    "@xcite )    as has been shown by v. efimov  @xcite , in the limit of large scattering length , @xmath13 ( unitary limit ) , the three - boson spectrum consists of an infinite number of states that accumulate to zero with the ratio between the energies of two consecutive states being @xmath14 .",
    "this is known as the efimov effect and its characteristics have been the subject of an intense investigation from both experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite point of view . in recent years",

    "it has been shown that eq.([eq : energyzr ] ) has to be modified in order to take into account the finite - range character of those calculations .",
    "based on the analysis of the energies of the three - body system obtained numerically , the following modified equation has been deduced @xmath52 despite some similarities , there are several important differences to the zero - range theory of eq.([eq : energyzr ] ) .",
    "\\(i ) the parameters @xmath53 carry explicitly the index @xmath41 labeling the different tree branches since the ratio @xmath54 for two successive branches is in general slightly different from the scaling factor @xmath55 .",

    "the replacement of @xmath1 by @xmath59 introduces some range corrections as the value of @xmath1 moves away from the unitary limit .",
    "it should be noticed that the relation @xmath60 is exact in the case of zero - range two - body interactions .",
    "\\(iii ) the main modification in eq.([eq : energyn3 ] ) is the introduction of the shift parameter @xmath61 . the origin of the shift has been discussed in ref .",

    "the index @xmath41 identify the @xmath73 branch and the index @xmath74 takes the value @xmath75 .",
    "however , unlike in the zero - range theory , the parameters @xmath76 explicitly show the index @xmath41 labeling the different @xmath73 branches due to the finite - range corrections in @xmath53 .    it should be stressed that , for @xmath38 , the @xmath72 case is of particular interest since it describes bound states . in the next section , we analyze the @xmath72 branch extracting the @xmath77 values from the numerical solutions and showing that they have a linear dependence with @xmath0 with a slope slightly different to the one suggested by the zero - range theory .",
    "we will show that , as @xmath1 moves from the unitary limit toward lower positive values , the validity of eq.([eq : energygn ] ) could be limited .",
    "the system becomes more compact losing its universal character . in the case of @xmath78",

    "the ground states up to 10 atoms have been obtained within dmc with the tty potential  @xcite as the he - he interaction . in the latter ,",

    "it should be noticed that the tty and the lm2m2 interactions produces very close results  @xcite for the helium dimer and trimer and , therefore , the results of the tbg+h3b interaction are almost on top of the results of the tty potential .",

    "@xcite .",
    "all above analyses show that the finite - range - corrected universality relations proposed in the present work can be used to analyze different types of measurements and theoretical descriptions of shallow states in bosonic systems .",
    "however , we notice that the results obtained with hfdhe2 and plotted in fig.[fig : lewerenz ] do not follow any more the linear behavior around @xmath210 .",
    "they tend to follow a square root behavior since at @xmath211 the ratio @xmath212 is almost constant indicating the well known linear dependence of the energy ground state with @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this analysis shows the transition between the quadratic and linear behavior of the ground state energy with @xmath0 . in the quadratic regime",
    "the bosons are well apart , the details of the interaction are not important and the system shows the universal behavior described by eq.([eq : energygn ] ) . as the number of bosons increases the system becomes more compact loosing the universal behavior .",
    "the strong short - range repulsion prevents the collapse of the system and is responsible for the linear regime .",
    "this explanation clarifies the behavior of the results from ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath213 . in this case",
    "a very long - range repulsive three - body force has been included making the transition to the linear regime already at low values of @xmath0 .",
    "the observed transition from the quadratic to @xmath214 linear behavior for the case of realistic interaction with a ( positive ) large two - body scattering lengths is very interesting and in future should undergo a deeper analysis .",
    "in the present work we have discussed dsi in shallow states of @xmath0-boson systems . first of all , we have proposed an extension of universal relation , known from three - body zero - range theory , to @xmath38 using the results of refs .",
    "this is summarized in eq.([eq : energygn1 ] ) which shows explicitly dsi and the two - level @xmath0-body structure attached to each level @xmath41 of the three - boson system .",
    "then we have extended eq.([eq : energygn1 ] ) to include corrections due to the finite - range nature of the two - body interactions .",
    "these corrections are encoded in the shift @xmath144 which we introduce into eq.([eq : energygn ] ) following ref .",
    "@xcite . at the origin of the extension of the universal equations to general @xmath0 is our finding that the universal function in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : energygn ] ) that governs the three - boson dynamics is the same as the one that governs the @xmath0-boson dynamics .",
    "such a conclusion has been made by analyzing the solutions of the schrdinger equations obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite with various model potentials . to our knowledge",
    "this remarkable fact was not anticipated before .",
    "the second striking property of the universal equations ( [ eq : energygn ] ) is the linear relation between @xmath96 , a particular form of the universal function , and @xmath59 ( or @xmath1 in the zero - range theory ) . in the zero - range limit",
    "the straight lines go through the origin and , accordingly , the theory has only one parameter : the slope . in the case of finite - range interactions",
    "the linear relation between @xmath96 and @xmath59 still holds but the straight lines do not go through the origin and , therefore , the theory has two parameters : the slope and the distance along the @xmath103 axis to the origin given by the shift @xmath215 .",
    "this linear behavior follows from the linear dependence of the scale parameter @xmath76 and the finite - size scale parameter @xmath216 on @xmath0 .",
    "this property allows us to recover the universal @xmath0-body relations in the zero - range limit .",
    "we have checked if results available in the literature exhibit universal behavior given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : energygn ] ) .",
    "we have plotted in the @xmath105 plane the experimental data on the energies of the @xmath185li trimers , measured in ref .",
    "@xcite and proved that they show linear behavior . from the linear plot we extracted the values of @xmath196 and @xmath199 . at the unitary limit , we obtain @xmath186 , which can be checked either experimentally or theoretically .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed @xmath0-body energies calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite where a particular parametrization have been proposed .",
    "however , we have shown that in both cases the linear behavior in the @xmath105 plane persists thus restricting the number of parameters , needed to describe these systems , to two for each @xmath0 .",
    "moreover those results show the expected linear dependence of the energy wave number on @xmath0 at the unitary limit .",
    "all these findings support both the zero - range and finite - range universal relations proposed here .",
    "a further analysis shows that universal relations persist only for attractive two - body potentials . in real systems , a strong repulsion between atoms an short distances exists , which for fixed and ( positive ) finite values of @xmath59 leads to transition to the square root behavior of energy wave number with @xmath0 .",
    "for particular case of ref .",
    "@xcite this occurs around @xmath217 . at larger @xmath0",
    "the wave numbers can not be described by the zero - range theory which predicts a quadratic behavior of the ground state energy with @xmath0 . in this respect",
    "it would be interesting to study the boson clusters which have negative values of the two - body scattering length . in this case the shallow states are better realized and the transition between the quadratic and linear regime should occur at larger values on @xmath0 .",
    "in fact the results of ref .",
    "@xcite at the unitary limit show the transition at bigger values of @xmath0 than the results of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained at positive values of @xmath59 .",
    "we hope that these findings will stimulate new experimental and theoretical studies of @xmath0-body shallow states",
