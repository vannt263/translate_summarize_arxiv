    "a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn , also ` plerion ' ) is a filled - centre supernova remnant ( snr ) which possesses a flat radio spectrum , centrally peaked radio and x - ray emission , highly polarized radio emission , and is powered by a rapidly rotating neutron star . 21  is a particularly interesting pwn since it was the first pwn discovered to be surrounded by an x - ray halo  @xcite with limb - brightening  @xcite .    in the 1970s ,  @xcite  and  @xcite   mapped 21  in the radio and found an elliptical brightness distribution with peak brightness near the geometric centre of the remnant , similar to the crab nebula .",
    "@xcite  performed 22.3  ghz observations and found axisymmetric filaments and suggested they resulted from a two - sided collimated outflow of particles in precession from a central pulsar .",
    "they also found that the x - ray maximum was located in a minimum in the small - scale radio emission , suggesting the two types of emission originate from the pulsar in a different way .    in 1999 ,  revealed a 150-radius halo at x - ray wavelengths surrounding the 40-radius pwn  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the pwn was well described by a power - law model with the photon index steepening ( increasing ) away from the central source .",
    "the x - ray halo was also detected with  and found to have a non - thermal spectrum that is consistent with the  study ( warwick et al .",
    "the halo s circular symmetry , lack of limb brightening , and non - thermal spectrum led to the earlier suggestion that the halo was an extension of the pwn rather than a shell formed by the blast wave of the supernova explosion .",
    "however , the lack of radio emission from the halo would make this interpretation problematic as the size of the pwn in x - rays would then exceed the radio size by a factor of @xmath74 , a characteristic that is at odds with pwn morphology .",
    "safi - harb et al .",
    "( 2001 ) noted that , since 21  is bright and heavily absorbed , a significant portion of the emitted x - rays could interact with dust and be scattered , forming a halo around the bright core .",
    "bandiera & bocchino ( 2004 ) modelled the halo as an effect of dust scattering in the foreground medium .",
    "while dust scattering could not explain the bright knots observed in the north of the remnant ( referred to as the northern knot or ` north spur ' , see figure  [ figure : regionpic ] ) , a good fit can be obtained to the remainder of the halo .",
    "matheson & safi - harb ( 2005 ) showed   imaging results ( modified version in figure  [ figure : regionpic ] ) revealing a candidate for the shell of the supernova remnant 21  in the form of limb - brightening at the eastern boundary of the x - ray halo .",
    "they also revealed previously unseen detail in the pwn , and showed that the power - law photon index increases from @xmath0 = 1.61  @xmath2  0.04 ( at the centre of the pwn ) to @xmath0  =  2.15  @xmath2  0.13 ( at a radius of 40 , the edge of the bright pwn ) , then remains flat at @xmath0  @xmath7  2.4 inside the halo between a radius of 40  and 150(@xmath12  =  2.2  ) .",
    "bocchino et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used  and  data to study the x - ray halo of 21 .",
    "they interpret the diffuse halo as a dust scattering halo , the eastern limb as the location of particle acceleration at the forward shock , and the brightest northern knot ( or ` north spur ' ) as a possible knot of ejecta in adiabatic expansion .",
    "however , the spectral nature of the northern knot and limb are still under debate .",
    "in particular , two solutions with different spectral properties were found for the northern knot .",
    "as well , the  data used in bocchino et al .",

    "we also present the first evidence for thermal emission from the pulsar ( section  [ section : psrspec ] ) and for variability in the pwn ( section  [ section : variable ] ) .",
    "21  was chosen as a calibration target for the  x - ray observatory and , as a result , 21  has been frequently observed using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) and the high resolution camera ( hrc ) .",

    "2006 february , 578.6 ks , table  [ table : exptime ] ) in the variability study (  4 ) .",
    "since data observed at -100@xmath23c can not be corrected for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , we made use of 56 acis observations ( 480.2 ks ) in the spectroscopic analysis presented here , a factor of @xmath72.5 deeper than the study by bocchino et al .",

    "the pwn is approximately 40  in radius and is seen to have indentations in the northwest and southeast . as well , many filamentary structures can be seen in the pwn .",
    "the x - ray halo extends to a radius of 153  with limb - brightening observed along the eastern edge .",
    "the foreground source ss  397 in the southwest portion of the halo was removed from the data prior to any spectral analysis .",
    "the northern portion of the halo is dominated by bright knots which appear to merge with the limb in the northeast .",
    "the brightest knot is located north and slightly to the west of the pwn . as mentioned earlier ,",

    "the pwn appears slightly larger at 4.75  ghz than at 22.3  ghz , but the images at 22.3  ghz and 0.210 kev are comparable in size , which indicates a small magnetic field in the pwn . indeed ,",
    "a low magnetic field estimate ( @xmath8@xmath725  @xmath9gauss , see also  5.2 ) has been inferred from modeling g21.50.9 ( de jager et al .",
    "the most prominent difference between the radio and x - ray emission is in the centre of the pwn .",
    "the pulsar is seen in a location that peaks in x - rays but has a minimum in radio emission .",
    "the x - ray emission traces the particles freshly injected by the pulsar , whereas the radio emission traces the older population characterized by a much larger synchrotron lifetime .",

    "<S> in 1999 , the  x - ray observatory revealed a 150radius halo surrounding the 40-radius pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) 21 . </S>",
    "<S> a 2005 imaging study of 21  showed that the halo is limb - brightened , and suggested this feature is a candidate for the long - sought supernova remnant ( snr ) shell . </S>",
    "<S> we present a spectral analysis of snr 21 , using the longest effective observation to date ( 578.6 ks with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , 278.4 ks with the high - resolution camera ( hrc ) ) to study unresolved questions about the spectral nature of remnant features , such as the limb - brightening of the x - ray halo and the bright knot in the northern part of the halo . </S>",
    "<S> the  analysis favours the non - thermal interpretation of the limb . </S>",
    "<S> its spectrum is well fit with a power - law model with a photon index @xmath0  =  2.13 ( 1.942.33 ) and a luminosity of @xmath1 ( 0.58 kev ) = ( 2.3@xmath20.6)@xmath310@xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 ( at an assumed distance of 5.0 kpc ) . an @xmath6 model was also used to fit the spectrum between the radio and x - ray energies . while the absence of a shell in the radio still prohibits constraining the spectrum at radio wavelengths , we assume a range of spectral indices to infer the 1  ghz flux density and the roll - off frequency of the synchrotron spectrum in x - rays , and find that the maximum energy to which electrons are accelerated at the shock ranges from @xmath760130 tev ( @xmath8/10@xmath9g)@xmath10 , where @xmath8 is the magnetic field in units of @xmath9 g . for the northern knot , we constrain previous models and find that a two - component power - law ( or @xmath6 ) + @xmath11 model provides an adequate fit , with the @xmath11 model requiring a very low ionization timescale and solar abundances for mg and si . our spectroscopic study of 1833 , the highly energetic pulsar powering 21 , shows that its spectrum is dominated by hard non - thermal x - ray emission with some evidence of a thermal component that represents @xmath79% of the observed non - thermal emission and that suggests non - standard rapid cooling of the neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the acis and hrc - i images provide the first evidence for variability in the pwn , a property observed in other pwne such as the crab and vela . </S>"
