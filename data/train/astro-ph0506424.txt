    "once thought to be simple old and metal - rich systems @xcite , elliptical galaxies have been studied extensively over the past thirty years .",
    "a number of studies ( e.  g. gonzalez 1993 , hereafter g93 ; rose et  al .",
    "1994 ; jrgensen 1997 ; tantalo , chiosi , & bressan 1998 ; kuntschner & davies 1998 ; trager et  al .",
    "2000a ; longhetti et al .",
    "2000 ; terlevich & forbes 2002 ; caldwell , rose , & concannon 2003 ) have shown that elliptical galaxies span a wide range of ages , with a relatively small spread in metallicity [ z / h ] .",
    "the enhancement ratio , @xmath1/fe ] , of mg and nucleosynthetically related elements relative to iron peak elements is also found to be significantly greater than solar .",
    "* hereafter tfwg ) found that elliptical galaxies occupy a two - dimensional  metallicity hyper - plane \" in the space of [ z / h ] , @xmath1/fe ] , log  @xmath2 , and log  @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the light - weighted single stellar population ( ssp ) equivalent age and @xmath3 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "although cluster galaxies are older on average than field galaxies , a wide range of ages is seen in both environments @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that a frosting of continuing star formation is necessary to explain the lack of color evolution in early type field galaxies since @xmath4 .",
    "tfwg also proposed a frosting model of star formation , as will be discussed in more detail in   3.4 .",
    "this result emphasizes the important point that the analysis of galaxy properties using ssp models does not accurately reflect the actual star formation histories of most galaxies . as tfwg and @xcite",
    "also note , the observables do not discriminate well between different star formation histories . in multiple stellar population models , different combinations of mass fractions , ages , and metallicities can produce observationally indistinguishable galaxies .",
    "because the @xmath5 elements are primarily produced in sn ii while sn ia produce mostly fe , @xmath1/fe ] may reflect the duration of star formation assuming a constant , universal imf . in high - redshift starburst , [ @xmath5/fe ]",
    "will be high , as no sn ia could have gone off to introduce additional fe .",
    "in contrast , the long and continuous star formation histories typical of spiral galaxies produce @xmath6\\sim0 $ ] as a result of plentiful sn ia enrichment over billions of years .",
    "thus abundance ratios might constrain the formation mechanism of individual galaxies .",
    "two extreme formation mechanisms are a fast clumpy collapse model and a spiral merger model .",
    "the fast clumpy collapse model is in essence a refinement of the classical @xcite monolithic collapse scenario : protogalactic gas clouds collide and merge at high redshift , forming stars rapidly as the gas dissipatively collapses to the center of the system . in a major merger of two spirals ,",
    "the bulk of the total mass is already in stars formed over long timescales , while the remaining gas is metal - rich with near solar [ @xmath5/fe ] .",
    "an elliptical formed in a fast clumpy collapse would have high global [ @xmath5/fe ] values since most stars formed from gas enriched by only a handful of sn ii .",
    "previous spectroscopic data sets ( e.  g. , g93 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) do not necessarily include a representative sample of elliptical galaxies in the local universe .",
    "thus conclusions based on such data sets may reflect some unanticipated bias in sample selection rather than physical relations between structural and/or stellar population parameters of elliptical galaxies .",
    "stellar population modeling has advanced considerably in recent years : the inclusion of nonsolar abundance ratios among @xmath5-elements as pioneered by @xcite and @xcite has been included in more recent models such as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tmb ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "sample selection , observations , and data reduction are described in   2 .",
    "the data are analyzed and stellar population parameters are derived in   3 .",
    "conclusions are presented in   4 .",
    "a volume  limited sample is defined , consisting of all 45 early type ( e or s0 ) galaxies with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 km @xmath9 for @xmath10 km @xmath9 @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the galaxies were selected using the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the cumulative luminosity distribution of this sample is consistent with that of a schechter function @xcite with the standard parameters of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that the sample proposed here provides a reasonable sampling of nearby elliptical galaxies within a magnitude of @xmath17 , and that the sample does not suffer from significant incompleteness near the faint limit .",
    "the distance measurements used in selecting this sample are from @xcite . the volume  limited sample is presented in table  [ vlsample ] .",
    "many galaxies were previously observed by g93 , and are noted as such . for newly observed galaxies we list @xmath0 per pixel near the h@xmath18 line .",
    "although the sample has somewhat lower @xmath0 than the g93 sample , this has only a small effect on the total observational errors due to the typical size of calibration uncertainties ; see  2.6 .",
    "the 10 galaxies that were not observed are consistent with being drawn from the same population as the 35 galaxies that were observed , as judged by one - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests on their distribution in velocity dispersion and @xmath19 magnitude .",
    "the observing program used the kast spectrograph with the 1200 lines / mm grating blazed at @xmath20 on the lick 3  meter telescope .",
    "observations consist of @xmath21 25  minute exposures on a galaxy , usually with the @xmath22-long slit oriented along the galaxy s major axis , interspersed with 5  minute `` blank '' sky exposures on fields several arcminutes away from the target galaxy . the spectral range @xmath23@xmath24 was observed , with instrumental resolution of approximately 100  km / s .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the galaxies are typically @xmath25  km / s . early observing runs suffered from slightly poorer resolution as a result of suboptimal spectrograph focus .",
    "the slit width was typically @xmath26 , though in poor seeing conditions this was increased to @xmath27 .",
    "spectral resolution was measured independently for each observing run to account for changes in resolution due to different slit widths or focus settings .",
    "the plate scale for the spectrograph in this configuration was @xmath28/pixel in the dispersion direction and @xmath29/pixel in the spatial direction .",
    "numerous lick index standard star observations were made , drawing from the set of stars in common between the lick / ids standards of @xcite and the @xcite standards .",
    "flat fields were created for each night of each observing run .",
    "the dome flat input images were averaged in the spatial direction to one dimension , and this median dispersion axis was then expanded back to the full size of the ccd .",
    "the final flat field images used in this work are the input flat fields divided by the one dimensional median for each row of the ccd .",
    "these flat field images correct for pixel - to - pixel quantum efficiency variations only .",
    "the data do not extend to red wavelengths where ccd fringing corrections become important .",
    "proper sky subtraction is crucial for accurately measuring line strengths in galaxies .",
    "oversubtraction of sky flux creates spuriously large line strengths , while undersubtraction has the reverse effect . for all but the most extended galaxies , the ends of the slit provide adequate sky subtraction .",
    "this simple technique was used where applicable for the galaxies observed during or after 2002 .",
    "the most extended galaxies , and those observed prior to 2002 , were reduced using the offset sky spectra interspersed with the galaxy observations .",
    "the observations were not taken under photometric conditions , and the sky was found to vary unpredictably over timescales much shorter than that of a typical galaxy exposure . as a result ,",
    "averaging the sky spectra taken immediately before and after each galaxy spectrum and scaling the sky spectrum by the ratio of exposure times is not sufficient for accurate sky subtraction .",
    "the proper amount of sky continuum was estimated by forcing the sky - subtracted radial brightness profile to conform as closely to an @xmath30 law @xcite as possible , as explained below .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath30 law provides an excellent fit to all elliptical galaxies between @xmath31 .",
    "first , the iraf task geomap was used to rectify the galaxy spectrum such that a fixed spatial location along the slit lies at a constant @xmath32  pixel coordinate .",
    "cosmic rays and bad pixels were removed at this step .",
    "the median of the galaxy spectrum images was subtracted from each individual frame .",
    "the resulting difference frames were then divided by the median image plus a floor value equal to ten times the standard deviation at the edges of the slit .",
    "the resulting fractional deviation image was used to flag deviant pixels by interactively setting a threshold value .",
    "the flagged pixels and all neighboring pixels were masked from the input images , which were then combined to form the galaxy spectrum .",
    "each input exposure was corrected for frame to frame variations in the background flux , putting every exposure on a common relative sky continuum scale .",
    "specifically , the combined galaxy spectrum was subtracted from each cosmic ray corrected input spectrum .",
    "the statistics of the difference image near each edge of the slit were used to estimate a relative sky offset between the input images .",
    "the measured offsets were added or subtracted from each spectrum to place them all on a common relative sky continuum scale prior to measuring the absolute sky subtraction amount needed to fit an @xmath30 profile .",
    "since sky intensity varies slowly with wavelength , a wavelength - independent offset was used in order to best match the sky continuum levels near the h@xmath18 , mg@xmath33 , fe5270 , and fe5335 lines .",
    "next , the combined galaxy spectrum was collapsed along the dispersion axis in two wavelength ranges , one around the wavelength of h@xmath18 and one around the wavelengths of the mg@xmath33 , fe5270 , and fe5335 lines , to create radial intensity profiles .",
    "an @xmath30 profile was fit to the galaxy radial profiles at intermediate radii .",
    "finally , a constant offset was subtracted across the entire spectrum .",
    "this sky continuum level was determined to be that offset which results in the best fit to a de vaucouleurs profile extending to large radii . in practice",
    "little difference was found between the best fit offset in the two wavelength ranges used to produce radial intensity profiles .",
    "extraction and dispersion correction of the spectra used standard iraf packages .",
    "the input spectra to these tasks incorporate the relative and absolute sky continuum adjustments described above , and have been median combined with cosmic ray rejection as above , but have not been rectified .",
    "instead , the extraction procedure traces the object spectrum across the ccd .",
    "the galaxy spectra were extracted in apertures extending to @xmath34 from the galaxy center , as per g93 .",
    "effective radii were taken from @xcite .",
    "galaxies were dispersion corrected using lamp spectra taken immediately before or after the galaxy observations , at the same telescope position .",
    "these lamp spectra were extracted using the same trace as the galaxy spectra .",
    "a high  order polynomial ( typically fifth order ) was fit to the @xmath35 lamp lines , and this dispersion correction was then applied to the galaxy spectrum .",
    "typical wavelength calibration uncertainties are @xmath36 .",
    "line widths of the lick indices defined in @xcite and @xcite were calculated using a version of the bwid program , provided by r.  m.  rich @xcite .",
    "as bwid is not an iraf procedure , the data were read out into ascii files for input .",
    "test spectra from guy worthey s web page were used to confirm the accuracy of bwid .",
    "two sets of lick / ids indices were measured .",
    "the primary set of indices consists of h@xmath18 , mg_b _ , fe5270 , and fe5335 , while h@xmath37 , ca4227 , g4300 , fe4383 , ca4455 , fe4531 , @xmath38 , fe5015 , and fe5406 form the secondary set of indices ( table  [ index1 ] ) .",
    "the two sets are distinguished by both scientific and practical considerations .",
    "the primary set comprises the indices in common use in previous observational studies ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the spectral range of the models of @xcite allow for sophisticated error simulations of the primary indices , while simpler error estimates must be used for many of the secondary indices ; see   2.5 for details .",
    "several corrections must be applied before equivalent widths can be measured .",
    "first , the galaxy sample must be adjusted to a common radial velocity , @xmath39 .",
    "the extensive model library of @xcite was used to provide an empirical doppler correction .",
    "the galaxy spectra were cross correlated with an old , metal rich model spectrum , and the resulting velocity was used in the doppler correction .",
    "next , the galaxy sample was corrected to zero velocity dispersion .",
    "the following procedure was used .",
    "the model spectra were rebinned to match the doppler - corrected galaxy spectrum .",
    "an analytic continuum function was fit to the galaxy and each model spectrum .",
    "the model spectra were divided by their respective continuum functions , then multiplied by the galaxy continuum function to match the shape of the observed galaxy spectrum . a copy of each model spectrum",
    "was then smoothed to the velocity dispersion of the galaxy using the @xmath3 measurements from @xcite .",
    "a least - squares fit was performed to select the appropriate model for each galaxy .",
    "the fit was performed within a spectral region surrounding the mg  @xmath33 , fe5270 , and fe5335 lines : @xmath40@xmath41 . to empirically refine the galaxy s velocity dispersion ,",
    "the @xmath42 version of the best fitting model spectrum was used as a template for the pixfit code from @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath3 was then corrected for the different instrumental resolution of the galaxy and model spectra .",
    "the best fit model was then rebinned to a logarithmic wavelength scale and gaussian smoothed to the measured velocity dispersion of the galaxy , again taking the intrinsic resolution of the model spectrum into account .",
    "after transforming back to a linear wavelength scale , line widths were measured in the @xmath42 model spectrum smoothed to lick / ids resolution and the model spectrum smoothed to the galaxy s velocity dispersion and then to the lick / ids resolution .",
    "the ratio of the two measurements is the correction factor applied to the corresponding equivalent width measured from the galaxy spectrum .",
    "for a few indices ( fe4383 , ca4455 , fe4531 , and @xmath38 ) no model spectra were available covering the appropriate wavelengths ; for these indices @xmath3-corrections were calculated from @xcite .",
    "as indicated above , it is necessary to degrade spectra to the resolution of the lick image dissector scanner instrument which was used to make the stellar observations upon which the lick / ids system is based .",
    "the resolution function of this instrument is taken from @xcite .",
    "since the resolution varies strongly with wavelength at the blue end , smoothing was done piecewise in @xmath43 increments in that part of the spectrum , while a constant value was appropriate for the red end .",
    "an emission correction was required to accurately measure the h@xmath18 , h@xmath37 , and fe5015 indices .",
    "the [ oiii]@xmath44 line was used to estimate the amount of h@xmath18 emission ( trager et  al .",
    "since [ oiii]@xmath44 is adjacent to the fe@xmath45 line , it is impossible to accurately determine the continuum level .",
    "instead , model spectra were used .",
    "the best fitting model was subtracted from the galaxy spectrum , and the intensity of [ oiii]@xmath44 was measured on the difference spectrum .",
    "this line was measured by hand using the iraf task splot .",
    "the result was then converted to equivalent width using an estimate of the intensity level of the galaxy spectrum near [ oiii]@xmath44 .",
    "the [ oiii ] emission was converted to an h@xmath18 correction using equation  2 of @xcite . h@xmath37 and",
    "fe5015 were corrected as described in @xcite , with correction factors of @xmath46}\\lambda{5007}$ ] and @xmath47}\\lambda{5007}$ ] respectively . in ngc  1052",
    "h@xmath18 appears only in emission .",
    "ngc  3226 , with the next strongest [ oiii]@xmath44 line , also shows h@xmath18 emission within the aborption line , while all other galaxies show at most a slight distortion in the shape of the h@xmath18 absorption .",
    "lick index standard stars were used to calibrate the output line widths .",
    "the reduction procedure for standard star observations is a simplified version of that described above for the galaxy observations .",
    "a typical standard star is observed in five consecutive exposures of a few seconds integration time .",
    "after flat fielding and dark subtraction , the individual frames are median combined and then extracted .",
    "sky subtraction is performed via a linear fit between two sky regions near the star on the slit .",
    "the stellar spectrum is extracted in a user - defined aperture extending to the points at which the psf disappears into the sky background .",
    "this aperture is traced across the ccd as above . as with the galaxy spectra ,",
    "the accompanying calibration lamp spectra are extracted in the exact same aperture as the stellar spectrum .",
    "after dispersion calibration , the smoothing described above is applied .",
    "radial velocities are determined empirically by cross correlation , in this case using the jones spectra of the same star as templates .",
    "the standard star spectrum is read out into an ascii file , and line widths are measured by bwid .",
    "corrections for each of the lick indices are derived by comparing the observed stellar line widths for each observing run to the standard values .",
    "these calibration offsets are not constant from run to run , particularly for the fe5335 index .",
    "the data from this project are not flux - calibrated , while the lick / ids system was calibrated to a quartz lamp response curve .",
    "this mismatch is absorbed into the calibration corrections .",
    "the standard stars and galaxy spectra were observed with the same ccd , grating and grating tilt , and are thus on a common system .",
    "errors in the mean for the ids calibration to the primary indices are @xmath48@xmath49 , though run to run variations are often much larger . fully corrected measurements for each index , including estimates of the total error (   2.7 ) in each index , are presented in table  [ index1 ] .",
    "figure  [ index ] shows the measurements for each index plotted against the galaxy s velocity dispersion .",
    "the mg-@xmath3 relation @xcite is clearly evident , with ca4227 and @xmath38 following the same trend .",
    "the iron indices show similar behavior but with greater scatter , forming a mass - metallicity relation .",
    "the two balmer indices both follow the well - known trend that larger galaxies tend to have smaller values than smaller galaxies .",
    "the five galaxies with large ( @xmath50 ) [ oiii]@xmath44 emission are omitted from subsequent analysis due to their large uncertainties .",
    "empirical error simulations were performed as follows using the model spectra described previously .",
    "the model spectrum used in the velocity dispersion correction forms the basis for the error simulations for the corresponding galaxy .",
    "several potential sources of random error were simulated .",
    "poisson noise was modeled by adding the quadrature sum of the galaxy poisson noise and sky spectrum poisson noise to the model spectrum .",
    "the poisson errors were derived from the raw spectra ( flat fielded only , no dark or sky subtraction ) , in units of electrons rather than adu .",
    "error in the subtraction of the night sky lines was estimated as follows .",
    "the pixel value of the sky lines was multiplied by a small factor @xmath51 and added in quadrature to the above poisson error .",
    "the value of @xmath51 was chosen such that the simulated spectrum best matched the true galaxy spectrum .",
    "sky line subtraction error proved to be unimportant : @xmath52 provides a good match to the galaxy spectra .    to investigate the possibility of flat fielding error , a noise floor was introduced into the error calculations .",
    "this floor was simply added in quadrature to the poisson error , and the value of the noise floor was chosen so that the simulated spectrum best matched the galaxy spectrum . as with sky line subtraction noise ,",
    "flat fielding noise proved to be unimportant , and a noise floor of zero was used .",
    "two other sources of error are directly measured and included in the simulations .",
    "the uncertainty in the dispersion solution is calculated by iraf , and the error in sky continuum subtraction is easily estimated .",
    "these errors are included in the simulations , the first as a random shift in the wavelength scale and the second as a random shift in the continuum level of the model spectrum .",
    "sky subtraction error may be underestimated by this method , particularly at the blue end of the spectrum , far from the wavelength range in which the sky subtraction measurements were made .",
    "error simulations were performed in groups of 1000 to provide accurate statistics .",
    "each simulation spectrum was measured by bwid in exactly the same way that actual galaxy spectra were measured .",
    "three galaxies were used as the basis for these simulations : ngc  3115 , the galaxy with the highest @xmath0 in the sample , ngc  1209 , a galaxy with @xmath0 typical for the bulk of the galaxy sample , and ngc  4168 , a galaxy with relatively poor @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainty in the calibration to the lick / ids system deserves particular attention because for many indices this is the dominant source of error .",
    "the observed standard star primary index measurements are compared to the lick / ids values in figs .",
    "[ stdpre ] and [ stdtpre ] .",
    "the former shows that a constant calibration offset can correct the observations onto the standard system  no first - order term in index strength is needed for the calibration .",
    "[ stdtpre ] highlights the run - to - run variations in the necessary calibration offset .",
    "these offsets are calculated separately for each run , except for 2003 january 2 ( run",
    "4 ) which was incorporated in the 2002 november ( run  3 ) run calibration due to the limited data obtained that night .",

    "these external errors are shown at the right of figs .",
    "[ stdtpre ] and [ stdtpost ] ; the error bars are omitted in figs .",
    "[ stdpre ] and [ stdpost ] for clarity .",
    "the repeated observations of a subset of standard stars in several observing runs allows the internal calibration error to be measured .",
    "[ stdint ] shows these repeat observations for each run . instead of plotting the difference between the calibrated and standard index values for each star as above , in this figure the difference between calibrated individual observations and the average of all observations of that star",
    "is shown .    though not often listed , it is straightforward to calculate the uncertainty within the lick / ids system in any given observing run",
    ". @xcite lists the typical error for an individual ids measurement of each lick index .",
    "since each standard star was given equal weight in the calibration to the lick / ids system , the ids internal error was calculated as the average of the errors in the individual stars , weighted by the number of ids observations .",
    "the calibration to the lick / ids system is shown in fig .  [ stdchk ] .",
    "the calibrated standard star observations from this work are in good agreement with both the lick / ids system and standard star observations from g93 .",
    "several sources of error not included in the simulations can also affect the equivalent width measurements to varying degrees .",
    "these include incorrect radial velocities , velocity dispersions , emission correction , and calibration error , as well as possible problems with the adopted data reduction procedures .",
    "preliminary data reduction demonstrated that published radial velocities for the galaxies or standard stars do not necessarily agree with the observed spectra .",
    "the mismatches could be over @xmath53  km / s in magnitude , with correspondingly large effects on the equivalent width measurements .",
    "this source of systematic error is avoided through the use of our empirical radial velocity measurements , as described above .",
    "though the preliminary reductions did not show any similar problem with published velocity dispersions , empirical measurements were again chosen for the same reason .",
    "velocity dispersion corrections are known to be very index - dependent @xcite .",
    "the fitting functions from that work were used to translate a conservative error estimate @xmath54  km / s into index errors .",
    "these errors proved to be negligible for h@xmath18 and mg@xmath33 .",
    "the actual errors in @xmath3 are estimated to be @xmath555  km / s by the pixfit code .",
    "the uncertainty in the measured velocity dispersion is the quadrature sum of the internal error measured by pixfit with an estimate of the additional uncertainty due to template mismatch .",
    "the latter quantity was estimated to be @xmath56  km / s based on comparing the measured velocity dispersions using several model spectra which fit the data nearly as well as the best fit spectrum .",
    "the measured velocity dispersions can easily be compared with data in the literature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vdcomp ] .",
    "the mean offset is 3  km / s with an rms scatter of 11  km / s .",
    "the emission correction for h@xmath18 , h@xmath57 , and fe5015 can drastically increase the error for those galaxies for which the correction is large .",
    "the error in [ oiii]@xmath44 emission was estimated by measuring the emission line in the difference spectrum ( see above ) using several different continuum levels .",
    "the average difference between these alternate continuum level equivalent width measurements and the zero continuum equivalent width measurement ( which assumes a perfect match was achieved between the continuum levels of the model and observed spectra ) was taken to be the uncertainty in the [ oiii]@xmath44 measurement .",
    "for many galaxies with little or no [ oiii]@xmath44 emission , this uncertainty is negligible , while for the galaxies with the largest [ oiii]@xmath44 emission lines the uncertainty is so large as to render the emission corrections extremely suspect .",
    "the five galaxies with [ oiii]@xmath44 emission greater than @xmath58 equivalent width have been omitted from subsequent analysis of the volume - limited sample due to the large uncertainties .",
    "an important potential source of systematic error is the method of background subtraction .",
    "preliminary reductions tested two different techniques .",
    "the method using sky exposures is described above . a simpler technique of simply subtracting a linear interpolation of the background between two user - defined regions near the edge of the slit was also tested . the latter technique is the most common in the literature ( g93 long slit observations , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the possibility of age and abundance gradients makes it dubious for galaxies of large angular size . for most galaxies in this study , the slit edges provide adequate sky subtraction",
    "reducing the same galaxy using both sky subtraction methods results in final index measurements which differ by much less than the total uncertainties .",
    "this check also indicates that the technique described above using the sky exposures does not introduce significant wavelength - dependent biases into the spectrum at the blue end .",
    "in addition to sky continuum subtraction , the bright hg4358 night sky line contaminates the g4300 and h@xmath37 indices .",
    "the uncertainties of those indices are undoubtedly larger than estimated , and the uncertainties are likely to vary with galaxy redshift depending on whether the sky line falls in the index bandpass or a sideband .",
    "if the input images have non - negligible subpixel offsets from one another in the dispersion direction , it is possible that the effective instrumental resolution could be artificially degraded when the images are combined into the final two dimensional galaxy spectrum . to test for this , one galaxy",
    "( ngc  1209 ) was re - reduced in a different manner following sky subtraction .",
    "each input frame was reduced separately .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed on the two dimensional images using standard techniques ( identify , reidentify , fitcoords , and transform in iraf s longslit package ) .",
    "the @xmath34 aperture on each was traced and extracted , then doppler corrected and smoothed to lick / ids resolution .",
    "the average index values showed no significant difference from those derived using the previous data reduction technique .",
    "pixfit measured velocity dispersions less than @xmath59  km / s smaller than those measured on the combined extraction previously .",
    "we conclude that there is little loss of effective instrumental resolution from combining input images .",
    "since ngc  1209 was also used in the error simulations , the alternate reduction procedure above also provides an independent test of the estimated errors for each index .",
    "the alternate technique should measure only the random poisson errors between the spectra .",
    "thus _ a priori _ one expects smaller error bars than those estimated from the simulations which include several possible sources of systematic error as well .",
    "the error comparison confirmed this expectation , except for mg@xmath33 where the two error estimates were equal .",
    "the final error bars adopted for the primary indices for each galaxy are a quadrature sum of the errors from the error simulation appropriate for that galaxy s @xmath0 , the errors in @xmath3-correction and emission correction , and the internal and external calibration errors .",
    "table  [ error ] lists typical values for each of these quantities , as well as the uncertainty within the ids system for a typical observing run .",
    "errors for the secondary indices are taken from the scatter in the measurements of each index in the ngc  1209 individual frames , added in quadrature as above with the @xmath3-correction , emission correction , and ids calibration errors . since the calibration error is a large contribution to many of these index errors , the results should be reasonably accurate even for galaxies of significantly lower @xmath0 than ngc  1209 .    as a final consistency check , index measurements from this study",
    "are compared with measurements of the same galaxies from g93 and @xcite in fig .",

    "the h@xmath57 index is measured in the data from this work , and a comparison between the age estimates using h@xmath18 and h@xmath57 can be made as a check on the extent to which the choice of balmer index affects the resulting age estimates . within this balmer line comparison , it is also instructive to compare the effect of using different ssp models .",

    "ages derived using each set of models are plotted against each other in fig .",

    "schiavon model grids , in the sense of the thomas  et  al .",
    "models yielding ( on average ) younger ages on h@xmath18 grids and older ages on h@xmath37 grids compared to the schiavon models .",
    "the outliers in fig .",
    "[ balmercomp ] remain outliers in fig .",
    "[ betagamma ] using either set of models .",
    "the quantitative difference between age estimates from the two sets of models suggests that the choice of ssp model is more important than the choice of balmer index when attempting to measure ages by this method . since the two sets of models each produce consistent age measurements for some range of ages ( thomas  et  al .",
    "models are consistent for old galaxies ; schiavon models are consistent for young galaxies ) , for the purposes of this study there is no clear reason to prefer one to the other .",
    "therefore the choice to use the tmb models and measure ssp parameters on model grids with h@xmath18 as the age - sensitive index does not introduce any additional systematic error due to choice of models or balmer index .",
    "note that the above comparisons do indicate the presence of systematic errors arising from both sources , however the same would be true regardless of the models or balmer index selected .",
    "also , an inconsistency between ages derived using h@xmath18 and h@xmath57 does not necessarily imply that the ssp model being used is incorrect in some way . as noted in   1 , single stellar populations are a necessary simplifying assumption , but galaxies in general will have stellar populations of varying ages and metallicities .",
    "such a composite stellar population can easily yield different ages derived using h@xmath57 as the age sensitive index compared to using h@xmath18 as the age sensitive index .",
    "current stellar population analysis techniques rely on the single stellar population ( ssp ) assumption , that a single age , metallicity , and @xmath5-element abundance ratio can characterize the stellar population of a galaxy .",
    "more realistic stellar population models can be constructed , however there is no widely applicable method to fully constrain the problem  even in the simplest case of assuming two starbursts instead of one , the number of free parameters is more than double that of the ssp case ( two ages , two [ z / h ] , two [ @xmath5/fe ] , and the mass ratio between the two bursts ) . allowing for a larger number of bursts or continuous star formation further underconstrains the problem . in a few galaxies , ssp observations of their globular cluster ( gc ) populations ( for which the ssp assumption is correct rather than a means to obtain a luminosity - weighted average ) may allow two - burst multiple stellar population models .",
    "almost all elliptical galaxies contain at least two populations of gcs , as seen in bimodal color distributions ( e.  g. * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of these two gc populations allow the two sets of stellar population parameters for a two - burst galaxy model to be set in a consistent way .",
    "@xcite showed that this does not always work ; if the youngest gc population is coeval with the ssp age of the galaxy the resulting mass ratio between the two starbursts will necessarily be strongly weighted towards the younger burst . as shown in @xcite , for example ,",
    "although a small mass fraction of young stars is sufficient to change the measured ssp age by several gyr , mass fractions of 50% or more are required to produce ssp ages consistent with that of the young population itself .",
    "such large burst fractions are contrary to most expectations for galaxy formation .",
    "the gc populations of a few galaxies in the volume - limited sample have been studied spectroscopically . with stellar population information for two gc populations , the age , [ z / h ] , and [ @xmath5/fe ] for each burst can be estimated rather than being free parameters . in practice , [ @xmath5/fe ]",
    "can be ignored as the best available models for multiple stellar population analysis remain those of @xcite via worthey s dial - a - galaxy web page , which do not account for non - solar abundance ratios .",
    "the requisite data exist for four galaxies : ngc  3115 , ngc  3610 , ngc  4365 , and ngc  5846 .",
    "ngc  3610 is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "using ir photometry , @xcite found candidate intermediate - age gcs associated with ngc  4365 .",
    "these candidates were seemingly confirmed by @xcite finding a young and metal rich gc population with an age between 25  gyr and approximately solar metallicity .",
    "however , @xcite found that based on all balmer lines the gc population was coeval within the errors , with an age @xmath74  gyr .",
    "the data from @xcite were biased by low @xmath0 in the sense that some but not all of the intermediate age candidates from @xcite appeared young using only the h@xmath18 index . since the gc population is older than the ssp age of the galaxy , no viable two burst model can be constructed using the gc populations to constrain the bursts .",
    "ngc  3115 appears to be a similar case , with old gcs @xcite around an intermediate age galaxy .",
    "@xcite suggest that the galaxy itself is also old , however the ngc  3115 data presented here are of exemplary @xmath0 with negligible emission correction , and conclusively indicate an age between 47  gyr depending on whether h@xmath18 or h@xmath57 is used as the age - sensitive index .",
    "the aperture used in this work is larger than that of the data analyzed in @xcite , and @xcite showed that the contribution of a young stellar population increases with radius on the scale covered by aperture used here .",
    "the discrepancy between the measurement presented here and that of @xcite is therefore explained by differing stellar populations in the apertures used in each study .",
    "ngc  5846 @xcite has uniformly old gc populations at a range of metallicities .",
    "since the galaxy has an old ssp age ( table  [ ssp ] ) , the ssp assumption appears to be a reasonable approximation to the star formation histories of this galaxy .      in fig .",

    "error ellipses in the hyper - plane projections were calculated from the errors in the individual indices .",

    "monte carlo simulations were run propagating index error realizations for a particular galaxy into physical parameters and thence to the principal component axes of the hyper - plane .",
    "the rms scatter about the major and minor axes of the monte carlo distribution in the hyper - plane was used for the major and minor axis lengths of the @xmath75 error ellipses .",
    "the actual error distribution is not quite symmetrical : as one expects from looking at the model grids , a fixed level of index scatter leads to unequal parameter scatter in the young and metal - rich directions compared to the old and metal - poor directions .",

    "@xcite and @xcite argue that more massive , spherical systems form stars earlier and for a shorter duration than less massive , more flattened systems .",

    "the ten missing galaxies have a distribution in luminosity and velocity dispersion that is similar to the full set of 45 galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that there is no significant qualitative difference between ssp models ; for almost all galaxies the use of different models produces only a systematic offset in stellar population parameters .",
    "although different choices of models will result in different absolute ssp quantities , comparing one galaxy to another within the same set of models yields consistent results independent of the choice of models .",
