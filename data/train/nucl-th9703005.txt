    "a common problem to non - relativistic nuclear matter calculations has been the simultaneous reproduction of both the binding energy per nucleon ( @xmath1 mev ) and the saturation density @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "all modern realistic calculations of nuclear matter which employ two - body interactions such as brueckner - like approaches @xcite , hyper - netted - chain @xcite or coupled cluster @xcite approaches are not able to reproduce in a satisfactory way the above nuclear matter data . if for a given interaction one is able to predict the saturation density , then the binding energy is underestimated . similarly ,",
    "if one is able to reproduce the binding energy of nuclear matter , then the saturation density is too high .",
    "this results in the so - called coester band ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "fig : mbhfsat ] below ) , where the saturation point for a given nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is correlated with the strength of the tensor force in the nn interaction .    in the past years",
    "relativistic approaches to nuclear matter have also been developed .",
    "for example , brockmann and machleidt @xcite have recently shown , starting from a realistic nn interaction , that by performing a relativistic dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) nuclear matter calculation , one is able to meet the empirical nuclear matter data .",
    "another line of approach is represented by the relativistic mean field scheme of serot and walecka @xcite . however , the present relativistic approaches neglect the coupling to the negative energy solutions , and moreover relativistic approaches lead to a very small depletion of the fermi sea @xcite .",
    "this depletion is not consistent with recent @xmath4 experiments .",
    "therefore , we believe that it is still worth to properly investigate non - relativistic schemes based on extensions of the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach .",
    "one of the main problems with brueckner theory is that particle states are treated differently from hole states . in the standard bhf approach one",
    "employs a discontinuous single particle ( sp ) spectrum , with a self - consistent bhf part for the nucleons below and a free - particle part above the fermi surface .",
    "this leads to an unphysically large discontinuity of about 60 mev for the sp spectrum at the fermi level .",
    "several methods have been proposed to overcome this difficulty .",
    "mahaux and his collaborators@xcite used the real part of the reaction matrix to obtain a self - consistent sp spectrum which is continuous for all momenta . in the model - space brueckner - hartree - fock ( mbhf ) approach proposed by ma and kuo@xcite a continuous sp spectrum is obtained within a chosen model space ( defined for momenta @xmath5 ) , and the discontinuity at the model space boundary @xmath0 is rather small for proper values of @xmath0 .",
    "although both methods yield more binding energy than the standard bhf approach , the nuclear matter empirical data are not reproduced . however , by including pphh diagrams in the model space approach song et al .",
    "@xcite and jiang et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the saturation properties can be improved . comparing with the standard hole - line expansion in bhf calculations ,",
    "it is remarkable that the pphh diagrams calculation can simultaneously increase the nuclear - matter binding energy and lower the saturation density @xmath6 .",
    "a central question concerning the above pphh - diagram nuclear matter approach is how to choose the boundary momentum @xmath0 . in the past @xcite",
    ", one usually took a `` reasonable '' value for the size of the model space such as @xmath0 = 3.2 @xmath7 and proceeded to evaluate the nuclear matter pphh diagrams . to our knowledge",
    ", pphh - diagram nuclear matter calculations with other choices of @xmath0 have not been investigated in a systematic way .",
    "are there certain criteria which may help determine the boundary @xmath0 ?",
    "is there a saturation behavior in the sense that there exists a region where the results of pphh - diagram nuclear matter calculations are insensitive to the choice of @xmath0 ?",
    "the aim of this work is to study these questions .",
    "the answers to these questions may help confirm , or disconfirm , the rather encouraging results of the pphh - diagram calculations reported earlier .",
    "the reader should note that another way of summing pphh diagrams has been developed by dickhoff , polls and ramos , see e.g. , refs .",
    "there a self - consistent green s function ( scgf ) approach is used , where one solves the dyson equation in order to get the sp green s function .",
    "although the sp energies are kept real in the self - consistency scheme , as in our case as well , the two methods differ in the treatment of the poles in the in - medium scattering matrix . in the model - space approach , see the discussion in the two next sections and ref .",
    "@xcite , there are , by construction no poles at negative and positive starting energies in the effective interaction defined by the model - space reaction matrix .",
    "the poles from the retarded green s function are circumvented by a contour integration @xcite .",
    "one avoids thereby a numerically tedious evaluation of the two - body green s function and effective interaction , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , the scgf method of dickhoff , polls and ramos @xcite allows one in a direct way to study other properties than just the binding energy .",
    "the one - body green s functions can be used e.g. , in the study of momentum distributions and spectral functions .",
    "finally , our scheme to obtain an effective interaction appropriate for nuclear matter starts with a free nucleon - nucleon interaction @xmath8 which is appropriate for nuclear physics at low and intermediate energies . at present",
    "there are several potentials available .",
    "the most recent versions of machleidt and co - workers @xcite , the nijmegen group @xcite and the argonne group @xcite have a @xmath9 fit per datum close to @xmath10 . the potential model of ref .",
    "@xcite is an extension of the one - boson - exchange models of the bonn group @xcite , where mesons like @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the fictitious @xmath16 meson are included . in the charge - dependent version of ref .",
    "@xcite , the first five mesons have the same set of parameters for all partial waves , whereas the parameters of the @xmath16 meson are allowed to vary .",
    "the recent argonne potential @xcite is a charge - dependent version of the argonne @xmath17 @xcite potential .",
    "the argonne potential models are local potentials in coordinate space and include a @xmath11-exchange plus parameterizations of the short - range and intermediate range parts of the potential .",
    "the nijmegen group @xcite has constructed potentials based on meson exchange and models parameterized in similar ways as the argonne potentials .",
    "another important difference between e.g. , the bonn potentials and the argonne and nijmegen potentials is the strength of the much debated tensor force @xcite .",
    "typically , the bonn potentials have a smaller @xmath18-state admixture in the deuteron wave function than the argonne and nijmegen potentials , as well as other potential models . a smaller(larger ) @xmath18-state admixture in the ground state of the deuteron means that the tensor force is weaker(stronger ) .",
    "the strength of the tensor force has important consequences in calculations of the binding energy for both finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter , see e.g. , the discussion in ref .",
    "a potential model with a weak tensor force tends to yield more attraction in a nuclear system than a potential with a strong tensor force .",
    "the second aim of this work , is therefore to compare various nucleon - nucleon potentials , in order to study the role played by the tensor force .",
    "for this purpose we will work with three older versions of the bonn potentials defined in table a.1 of ref .",
    "the only essential difference between these potentials is the relative strength of tensor force , which make the role of the tensor force more transparent in our investigation .",
    "they are recognized by the labels a , b and c with the former carrying the weakest tensor force .",
    "such a set of potentials , fit to the same set of scattering data , allow us therefore to study the role played by the nuclear tensor force in a many - body approach like the present .",
    "moreover , these potentials are constructed in exactly the same way , the only differences being the value of various meson variables ( coupling constants , masses and cutoff energies ) . one may therefore be able to ascribe possible differences to the role played by certain mesons , or certain components of the nn interaction .",
    "in addition we have also done extensive calculations using the charge - dependent version of the bonn potential models ( cd - bonn ) , see ref .",
    "@xcite , and two potentials of the nijmegen group @xcite , one meson - exchange potential ( nijm - obe ) and a local potential with a non - local contribution to the central force , i.e.  the model nijm - i of ref .",
    "the reason for these choices is due to the fact that these potential models represent the most recent fits to the scattering data .",
    "the pphh - diagram nuclear matter calculations are closely related to the mbhf calculations , both employing a model space ( @xmath5 ) . in section [ sec : mbhf ] we will present the mbhf method and the results obtained with it .",
    "the basic method presented in section [ sec : mbhf ] is also used in the pphh - diagram method discussed in section [ sec : pphh ] .",
    "the results of the pphh - diagram calculations for nuclear and neutron matter are presented and discussed in sections  [ sec : result ] and [ sec : neutron ] , respectively . in section  [ sec : concl ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "the basic formalism of the mbhf has been exposed elsewhere , see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will therefore only briefly sketch the essential ingredients of the method .      following the conventional many - body approach , we rewrite the full hamiltonian @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the kinetic energy and @xmath8 the bare nn potential , in an unperturbed part @xmath22 and an interacting part @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , where we have introduced an auxiliary sp potential @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath25 is chosen such that @xmath26 be small , perturbative many - body techniques can presumably be applied . a serious obstacle to any perturbative treatment is the fact that the bare nn potential @xmath8 is very large at small internucleon distances , a fact which renders any perturbative approach highly prohibitive . to overcome this problem ,",
    "one introduces the reaction matrix @xmath19 , given by the solution of the integral equation @xmath27 with the model - space pauli exclusion operator @xmath28 the model - space sp spectrum is defined self - consistently by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the kinetic energy and the sp potential is @xmath31    ( 80,100 ) ( 25,5 )    the above mbhf approach is a generalization of the well - known bhf approach , the latter corresponding to a special case of the former with @xmath32 and commonly referred to as `` standard '' bhf . for the bhf method , only the kinetic energy ( free particle spectrum ) is included in the sp energy for momenta greater than @xmath33 , while below @xmath33 the sp potential @xmath34 is included as well . in the mbhf method ,",
    "the corresponding boundary is at @xmath0 , beyond which one uses the free - particle spectrum .",
    "the bhf and mbhf sp energies are constructed so that they are always real . to ensure this property ,",
    "we need to require that the mbhf spectrum @xmath35 has a sp potential @xmath34 which is always attractive .",
    "( otherwise the propagator in @xmath36 will have poles , leading to a complex @xmath36 . ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : sp ] , we show the sp potential @xmath34 for some typical values of @xmath0 .",
    "similar results are obtained using the other potentials . generally speaking ,",
    "when @xmath0 is small the sp potential is attractive . as @xmath0 increases",
    ", the mbhf sp potential becomes more repulsive . for @xmath37 3.8 @xmath7",
    ", @xmath38 is still attractive for small k , but becomes less attractive for larger @xmath39 and is close to zero at @xmath40 . for @xmath41 3.8 @xmath7 ,",
    "the sp potential becomes repulsive .",
    "when this happens , we will have a crossing between the free particle spectrum and the mbhf spectrum .",
    "this will in turn give rise to a sp potential which is no longer real , unless some @xmath42 procedure is imposed such as suppressing its imaginary part .",
    "to prevent such crossings , we have chosen @xmath43 3.8 @xmath7 as an upper bound for @xmath0 , which defines our model space .",
    "this caveat ensures that the mbhf @xmath19-matrix is always real .",
    "the mbhf approach is basically an intermediate scheme , in the sense that only two - particle scattering states outside the model space are accounted for .",
    "this means that both particles must have momenta larger than @xmath33 and that at least one of the fermions in the two - particle wave function has momentum larger than @xmath0 .",

    "( 80,115 ) ( 25,3 )    for small fermi momenta ( @xmath46 @xmath7 ) the results for the bonn a potential are very insensitive to the choice of @xmath0 .",
    "for a wide region of @xmath0 ( 2.0 - 3.5 @xmath7 ) the energy variation is less than 0.5 mev .",
    "for larger fermi momenta we see that the variation is somewhat stronger , however , we find a `` saturation '' behaviour in the vicinity of @xmath47 .",
    "this is a fortunate and desirable result .",
    "here we have a minimum for @xmath48 and moreover it is here that @xmath48 seems to be least sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "thus we believe that @xmath45 3.0 @xmath7 is an optimum choice for the mbhf calculations using the bonn a potential .",
    "note that intermediate states with large momentum components ( @xmath49 3 @xmath7 are induced by the short - range part of the nn interaction @xcite .",

    "similar results are also found for the bonn b potential .",
    "( 80,100 ) ( 25,3 )    one has to keep in mind that the strengths of the tensor force of the potentials discussed are different , as bonn a contains the weakest tensor force component of the three potentials considered , while bonn c contains the strongest one . since all three potentials reproduce the same set of scattering data , a potential containing a weaker tensor component needs a strong central component .",
    "intermediate states induced by the tensor force are relatively more strongly dominated by lower momentum components than states induced by the central force@xcite .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the energy contribution from scattering into states with momentum components lower than @xmath0 will be larger for potential c than for a. this is also reflected in the larger @xmath0-dependence in the calculations using potential c. the results using the other potentials are very similar and we find that it is a good approximation to use the model - space boundary @xmath453.0 @xmath7 for all potentials considered . in fig .",

    "the saturation density is slightly increased .",
    "the results show the well - known fact that within lowest - order brueckner theory one is not able to reproduce the empirical data for nuclear matter . in the next section",

    "the details of the pphh - diagram method for nuclear matter can be found elsewhere @xcite .",

    "the essence of the hole - line approach is that diagrams with ( n+1 ) hole lines are generally much smaller than those with n hole lines . with this criterion , diagram ( @xmath62 ) which has 3 ( independent ) hole lines would be negligible compared with diagram @xmath58 which has 2 hole lines .",

    "( 60,80 ) ( 25,0 )    in the @xmath110s@xmath111 channel , where the tensor force does not contribute , the energy shift is found to be much smaller . in fig .",

    "therefore , the @xmath0-dependence for all higher order partial waves is mainly due to the @xmath15 dependent one - body terms and shows up in the normalization factor .    for comparison",

    "@xcite.the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kmnewv ] .",
    "we see that the results are similar to those using the earlier versions of the bonn potential , in the sense that when the strength of the tensor force increases , the stability of the results as functions of @xmath0 worsens .",

    "note , however , that the tensor force is stronger for the nijm - i potential .",

    "we have found that for the mbhf approach the nuclear matter binding energy and saturation density vary little with @xmath0 for @xmath0 in the vicinity 3.0 @xmath7 .",
    "the location of this saturation region for @xmath0 is almost independent of the potential used .    for calculations including pphh diagrams we find a saturation region where the nuclear matter binding energy and saturation density vary rather little with @xmath0 for @xmath114 3.8 @xmath7 .",

    "our results have shown that the strength of the tensor force is important for the @xmath0-dependence . potentials with weak tensor force yield better convergence for large @xmath0 than those with stronger tensor force .",
    "the new potentials which have a @xmath9 fit per datum close to @xmath10 generally yield similar results as the older versions of the bonn potentials . for all potentials",
    "considered , the saturation density is substantially reduced when pphh diagrams are included .",
    "mbhf calculations for neutron matter are found to be insensitive to the choice of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the contribution from pphh diagrams is found to be small in this case .",
    "thus , combining this with our result for symmetric matter , we have shown that the contributions from pphh excitations in a nuclear medium depend strongly on the tensor force component of the nn interaction .",
