    "the energetic feedback from supernovae ( sne ) and massive stellar winds are crucial in setting the basic properties of galaxies , including masses , sizes , and star formation histories , as studied in numerical and semi - analytical models ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , this stellar feedback is thought to be the most important energy source for the multi - phase circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) around galaxies without an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the cgm is comprised of multi - phase gas ( hot gas @xmath15 , e.g. , @xcite ; warm - hot intergalactic medium @xmath16 , e.g.,@xcite ; cool gas @xmath17 , e.g. , @xcite ; and cold gas @xmath18 , e.g. , @xcite ) as well as relativistic particles ( cosmic rays ; crs ) and magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which produce broad - band emission via various emitting mechanisms . until now , how the galaxies distribute their feedback energy into different interstellar medium ( ism ) or cgm phases is still poorly understood ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "both the diffuse radio and x - ray emission in and around galaxies are thought to be closely related to sne feedback .",
    "the radio continuum emission at ghz frequencies is mainly produced by the synchrotron energy loss of relativistic electrons at @xmath19 energy .",
    "these high - energy electrons could be accelerated in supernova remnants ( snrs ) or superbubbles ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or from the interaction between the crs and the ism ( secondary crs , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the soft x - ray emission at @xmath20 from galactic halos",
    "is thought to be produced by a hot ( @xmath21 ) tenuous ( @xmath22 ) galactic outflow and its interface with entrained cool cloudlets , instead of the outflow itself ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the total soft x - ray luminosity is related to both the energy and mass injection rates into the hot phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as the sn rate and",
    "the energy / mass injection rates are all proportional to the star formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy , it is natural that the radio and soft x - ray luminosities of the galactic halos are both correlated to the mid- or far - infrared ( ir ) luminosity of the galaxy tracing the star formation activity .",
    "however , it is still not clear how the diffuse radio and x - ray luminosities of galaxies depend on the sne feedback energy injection rate ( linear dependence or not ) , and if the radiation efficiency ( the fraction of sn energy converted to radiation ) in radio and x - ray stays constant at different sfrs or in different types of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these questions are fundamental for understanding the fate of mass and energy originated from stellar feedback and its role in regulating the structure and evolution of galaxies .",
    "tight correlations between radio and ir luminosities of nearby galaxies were discovered as early as the 1980s ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in most of the studies ,",
    "the slope of the @xmath23 relation is found to be close to linear for the global properties of the galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the relation shows clear variations at small scales ( e.g. , @xmath2kpc , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite developed a calorimeter theory to explain the tight correlation between the non - thermal radio and thermal ir emission , assuming that the source strengths of relativistic electrons and uv photons are both proportional to the sn rate , and the leptonic crs ( electrons and positrons ) lose most of their energy within the galactic halo , which is also optically thick to the uv photons heating the dust and producing the ir emission .",
    "however , it is widely believed that galaxy disks are not calorimeters even for cr electrons , because many galaxies host extended radio halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , whether or not a galactic halo can be assumed to be a calorimeter for cr electrons is quite uncertain , and could be affected by many factors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "_ we therefore need to consider the radio halo in the total sne feedback energy budget . _",
    "slightly but significantly non - linear @xmath23 relations have also been found and non - calorimeter models have been developed to explain them ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies are extremely important for small scales ( e.g. , @xmath2kpc ) or low - sfr galaxies which do not match the calorimeter conditions .",
    "`` continuum halos in nearby galaxies - an _ evla _ survey '' ( chang - es ; @xcite ) is an unprecedented deep radio continuum survey of a radio - flux - limited sample of 35 nearby edge - on spiral galaxies with the karl g. jansky very large array ( hereafter _ jvla _ ) in its commissioning phase . for the first time , the deep _ jvla _ observations enable us to detect radio continuum halos in a statistically meaningful sample of nearby galaxies , thus allowing crs and magnetic fields in the halo to be included in the energy budget of galactic feedback .",
    "the major goals of the chang - es project are to investigate the occurrence , origin , and nature of the radio continuum halos , and to probe the disk - halo interaction .",
    "a descriptions of the full project is presented in detail in @xcite ( paper  i ) .",
    "detailed case studies of three galaxies , ngc  4631 , ugc  10288 , and ngc  4845 , are presented in @xcite ( paper  ii ) , @xcite ( paper  iii ) , and @xcite ( paper  v ) , respectively .    in paper",
    "iv ( @xcite ) , we presented intensity maps in two frequency bands [ c ( 6  ghz ) and l ( 1.6  ghz ) ] , with different weightings , as well as in - band spectral index maps , polarization maps , and spatially resolved mid - ir measurements of the sfrs .",
    "the data products are available to the public in chang - es data release 1 at http://www.queensu.ca/changes .",
    "our early results in paper  iv indicate that a galaxy with a higher sfr surface density tends to host a larger halo of magnetic fields and crs .",
    "as presented in paper  iv , the d - configuration measurements in c- and l - bands of the whole sample have little missing flux , therefore they are well - suited for statistical analysis of the total radio continuum luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "furthermore , 16 of the 35 chang - es sample galaxies are also included in the _ chandra _ survey of nearby highly - inclined disk galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the _ jvla _ and _ chandra _ measurements enable us to directly compare the diffuse radio and x - ray emission from both the galactic disk and halo , which are thought to be related to two of the most energetic phases of galactic feedback : the cr and the hot galactic outflow .    in this paper",
    ", we present statistical analysis of the radio continuum and soft x - ray emission of the chang - es galaxies based on the _ jvla _ d - configuration and the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : galpara ] , we summarize the data and galaxy parameters used in the present paper and define some subsamples . in  [ sec : statisticanalysis ] , we present a statistical analysis of the radio continuum emission of the galaxies and compare it to the x - ray and multi - wavelength properties of the galaxies .",
    "we further discuss the scientific implications of this statistical analysis in ",
    "[ sec : discussions ] .",
    "our major results and conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in the present paper , we study the dependence of the diffuse radio continuum luminosity of the whole galaxy ( disk+halo , @xmath0 ) on the multi - wavelength properties of the galaxies , such as the sfr and the sfr surface density , the stellar mass ( @xmath24 ) , the total baryon mass ( @xmath25 ) , and the energy injection rate from core - collapsed ( cc ) and type  ia sne ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "we list these parameters , as well as some other related parameters of the chang - es galaxies , in table  [ table : galpara ] .",
    "more information about the sample galaxies is summarized in @xcite .",
    "the sfr and the sfr surface density ( @xmath28 ) are directly quoted from @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : starburstdefi]a , but _ not _ listed in table  [ table : galpara ] ) .",
    "these star formation parameters are measured with spatially resolved _ wise _ 22  @xmath29 images , after removing bright unresolved nuclear sources in ngc  3735 and ngc  4388 , which are assumed to be due to an agn .",
    "the _ wise _ 22  @xmath29 sfrs adopted in paper  iv and the present paper are systematically lower than those adopted in paper  i ( on average 2.74 times lower ) .",
    "this is partially because in paper  i we have adopted an old sfr calibrator from @xcite which gives a sfr @xmath217% higher than the recent result @xcite , and partially because the sfr based on total ir luminosity ( as adopted in paper  i ) is also systematically higher than that based on mid - ir luminosity ( e.g. , _ wise _ 22  @xmath29 or _ spitzer _ 24  @xmath29 ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the average total ir to mid - ir luminosity ratio of our sample is @xmath2(18 - 60)% higher than those in the literature ( e.g.,@xcite ) , which could be an effect of the strong extinction in our highly inclined galaxies .",
    "we caution that each star formation tracer has its biases .",
    "we herein choose the _ wise _ 22  @xmath29 luminosity as the star formation tracer because it is less affected by the cold dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field which is not related to currect star formation .",
    "this cold dust contribution could be important for low - sfr galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which are common in our sample .",
    "we estimate @xmath24 of the galaxies using the _ 2mass _ k - band magnitude @xcite and a color - dependent mass - to - light ratio from @xcite .",
    "this estimate shows no significant difference from recent estimates of the stellar mass based on _ spitzer _ @xcite or _ wise _ observations @xcite . for ngc  3735 , which does not have an extinction - corrected b - v color listed in the hyperleda database @xcite , we assume the mass - to - light ratio to be 1 .",
    "we estimate @xmath25 from the inclination - corrected maximum gas rotation velocity ( @xmath30 ) and the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : starburstdefi]b ) .",
    "@xmath25 includes the contribution from stars and the h  i gas , but does not include the contribution from molecular gas @xcite .",
    "since @xmath25 is derived from the rotation velocity , it provides an alternative distance - independent measurement of the galaxy mass to those derived from the photometry methods ( such as @xmath24 , which depends on the assumed distance ) .    both the radio continuum and x - ray emission of galaxies",
    "are thought to be closely related to sn feedback .",
    "however , sne could be produced by both young and old stellar populations , which are quite different in both temporal and spatial distributions .",
    "we therefore need to estimate the energy injection rate from cc and type  ia sne , which are related to young and old stellar populations , respectively , in order to quantitatively combine the contributions from both populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we estimate @xmath26 and @xmath27 , adopting the cc sn rate per unit sfr from @xcite and the type  ia sn rate per unit stellar mass from @xcite .",
    "we also assume each sn injects a total energy of @xmath31 into the ism .",

    "the edge - on orientation of the chang - es galaxies highlights the multi - wavelength emission from the galactic halos .",
    "compared to previous observations , our _ jvla _ observations are deep enough to detect the extended halo component and have high enough resolution to detect and remove bright point - like sources .",
    "therefore , with the high - sensitivity , broad - band _ jvla _ data we are not only able to use the most accurate radio continuum measurements of a complete flux - limited nearby edge - on spiral galaxy sample , but are also able to study the spatial variation of the radio continuum properties in both disk and halo of individual galaxies . some preliminary results of these spatially - resolved studies are presented in @xcite and will be further discussed in companion chang - es papers .",
    "we have removed all the disconnected point - like sources around the galaxies but have included the agn and any extended extraplanar features in the final radio flux measurement .",
    "therefore , the radio luminosities quoted in the present paper are the emission from the whole galaxy , including the contributions from both the disk and the halo .",
    "we adopt bandwidths of @xmath32 and @xmath33 in c- and l - bands in order to convert the radio flux density to luminosity ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) for the convenience of comparison to @xmath36 and @xmath5 .",
    "we also calculate the integrated spectral index between c- and l - bands , which is defined as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the global flux density in c- and l - bands , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath39 are also listed in table  [ table : galpara ] .",
    "there is an amount of missing flux density that mainly depends on the spatial scale of the emission features and the array configuration . for d - configuration in l - band ,",
    "the largest angular scale is @xmath40 , larger than the optical diameter ( @xmath41 ) of all the chang - es galaxies @xcite . in most of the cases , even some starburst galaxies ,",
    "the vertical extension of the radio continuum emission is no larger than the extension in the radial direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the l - band data should include all the emission from the galaxy .",
    "for d - configuration in c - band , however , the largest angular scale is @xmath42 , smaller than the optical diameter of most of the chang - es galaxies .",
    "we are thus likely resolving out some extended diffuse emission .",
    "comparison with the catalog of @xcite suggests that we are typically missing @xmath43 of the diffuse flux density in the more extended chang - es galaxies ( assuming a spectral index of @xmath44 and ignoring the agn ) . to accurately measure",
    "the amount of missing flux density , deep single - dish observations are required . in general , larger galaxies and/or intense star forming galaxies may have large - scale radio continuum features , so a larger fraction of missing flux density in c - band .",

    "we further compare the x - ray measurements to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of hot galactic coronae in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the edge - on galaxies often show clear absorption features at the location of the galactic disk @xcite . in order to have a uniform comparison among different galaxies",

    "the x - ray luminosities are measured within a vertical distance of five times the exponential scale height , after quantitatively removing the contributions from unresolved stellar sources and correcting for the filtered absorbing galactic disk by interpolating the diffuse x - ray intensity profile @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosities are scaled to the distances of the chang - es galaxies adopted in the present paper .",
    "the presence of radio - bright agn and sometimes even extended features related to the agn could significantly affect the radio flux density measurements of the galaxies .",
    "the identification and properties of the agn of the chang - es galaxies will be presented in detail in a separate paper . in the present paper",
    ", we identify 13 galaxies with _ radio bright _ agn , satisfying at least one of the following criteria : ( 1 ) the galaxy has an unresolved radio core in higher resolution ( b- or c - configuration ) radio images which also shows polarization features and/or negative radio spectral index @xmath39 ; ( 2 ) there are lines of evidence for the existence of an outflow ( e.g. , radio jets or bubbles ) ; ( 3 ) by comparing with archival radio data , there is significant radio flux variability of the core of the galaxy ; ( 4 ) the galaxy has abnormal ir color in _ wise _ bands in the nuclear region ; ( 5 ) an agn is identified in the literature ( see a summary of the archival identification of agn for the chang - es galaxies in @xcite ) .    all the galaxies identified as hosting a radio bright agn",

    "these eight `` erb '' galaxies are : ngc  660 ( jet , variability ; @xcite ) , ngc  2992 ( extended nuclear radio structure , @xcite ) , ngc  3079 ( radio lobe , @xcite ) , ngc  4388 ( jet , @xcite ) , ngc  4438 ( jet , @xcite ; to be presented in a separate chang - es paper , damas et al .",

    "we identify five other galaxies with radio bright ( `` rb '' ) agn ( table  [ table : galpara ] ) .",
    "although some of the galaxies labeled with `` erb '' are indeed classified as radio quiet in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in the chang - es sample their radio flux densities are in general significantly affected by the presence of the agn . in the following sections , we will compare the results of statistical analysis with and without these `` erb '' galaxies included in the sample , while `` rb '' galaxies are still treated as normal galaxies with radio faint nuclei in all the calculations .",
    "all the `` erb '' and `` rb '' galaxies will be plotted with different symbols in the figures presented in this paper .",
    "we also include the milky way ( mw ) in some of our plots for comparison .",
    "the l - band radio luminosity is obtained from @xcite and converted to the same frequency and bandwidth as the chang - es sample , assuming a spectral index of @xmath45 .",
    "the error is calculated from the standard deviation of the luminosities of different models discussed in @xcite .",
    "the final l - band luminosity of the milky way adopted in this paper is @xmath46 .",
    "the sfr of the milky way is taken to be @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass of the milky way is taken to be @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray luminosity of the milky way is estimated from the _ rosat _ all sky survey : @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "similar to @xcite , we also define some subsamples for the convenience of comparison among different types of galaxies .",
    "different subsamples described below will be plotted as different symbols in the following statistical analysis .",
    "we use the local galaxy number density ( @xmath50 ; @xcite ) to characterize the galaxy environment , and define galaxies with @xmath51 as being in the field , while those with @xmath52 as being clustered .",
    "this is just a general classification to characterize the global environment of the galaxies .",
    "we caution that some galaxies in poor groups or interacting galaxies with close companions ( e.g. , ngc  3432 , @xcite ) have been classified as in the field , because they are not in rich clusters with a dense intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "we also separate early- and late - type disk galaxies with their morphological type code ( tc , table  [ table : galpara ] ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath53 are sa or s0 and are defined as early - type , while others are late - type .",
    "this is again a general classification without considering the highly distorted morphology of some interacting galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  660 ) .",
    "the star formation properties adopted in the present paper are estimated based on spatially - resolved mid - ir images @xcite , which allow us to estimate the sfr surface density , rather than just the global integrated ir luminosities adopted in @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt a new criterion to define starburst and non - starburst galaxies , i.e. , those with both @xmath54 and sfr surface density @xmath55 are starbursts while others are non - starbursts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : starburstdefi]a ) .",
    "such a definition of a starburst galaxy is roughly consistent with the criteria adopted in @xcite based on ir luminosity and color .",
    "it is expected from both theoretical and observational studies that only starburst galaxies with a sfr surface density above a threshold should have a significant amount of extraplanar hot gas blown out of the disk @xcite .",
    "ngc  4438 and ngc  5084 have extremely high sfr surface density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : starburstdefi]a ) . in these two galaxies ,",
    "most of the _ wise _ ir flux comes from the nucleus , but it is uncertain how much of it is due to star formation or an agn .",
    "similar to @xcite , we also utilize the spearman s rank order correlation coefficient ( @xmath56 ; by definition , @xmath57 , negative means anti - correlation ) to describe the tightness of a correlation .",
    "we consider @xmath58 as a tight correlation , @xmath59 as a weak correlation , and @xmath60 as no correlation .",
    "we further characterize some important relations with simple expressions , with the corresponding root mean square ( @xmath61 ) around the best - fit relations describing the dispersion . in order to fit a relation and to estimate the uncertainties of @xmath56 and @xmath61 , we first generate 1000 bootstrap - with - replacement samples of the primary data and then resample each data point , assuming a normal distribution .",
    "for each re - generated sample , we fit the data with the same model and measure the model parameters , as well as @xmath56 and @xmath61 , in the same way .",
    "these measurements are then rank - ordered ; their 68% percentiles around the original fitting parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath61 , are finally used as the estimates of their @xmath62 errors presented in figures and equations .",
    "whenever we need to fit the logarithmic slope of a relation , we perform a linear fit with the idl function `` _ _ ladfit _ _ '' in a logarithmic scale for both @xmath63 and @xmath64 axes .",
    "the `` _ _ ladfit _ _ '' function uses a robust least absolute deviation method and has the advantage of being less affected by some significantly outlying data points . in the following sections , the eight galaxies whose radio fluxes are highly affected by the agn ( `` erb '' in table  [ table : galpara ] ) will not be included in quantitative calculations of @xmath56 and @xmath61 presented on the figures , but we will compare the fitted relations between different galaxy parameters including these `` erb '' galaxies or not .      in fig .

    "galaxies with extremely radio bright agn ( symbols surrounded with a thick blue circle in the figures and listed as `` erb '' in the last column of table  [ table : galpara ] ) are also excluded from these quantitative calculations . in general , there are tight , weak , and no correlations between the radio luminosities and the sfr , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the milky way is consistent with other galaxies , but may be slightly less luminous in l - band . most of the `` erb '' galaxies are significant outliers in fig .",
    "[ fig : lradiogalpara]a , b , with unusually high radio continuum luminosities .",
    "the @xmath7 correlations shown in fig .  [ fig : lradiogalpara]a , b are so tight that we can determine the logarithmic slopes of the relations . as the sfr adopted here is linearly related to the ir luminosity ( @xmath65 ; @xcite ) , the slopes of the @xmath7 relations ( @xmath0 represents the c- and l - band luminosities @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) are also representative of the slopes of the @xmath23 relations which have been extensively studied in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the best - fit @xmath7 relations are consistent with a linear slope within 1  @xmath68 for c - band and a significantly super - linear slope at @xmath9 confidence level for l - band ( errors are quoted at 1  @xmath68 confidence level ) : @xmath69 and @xmath70 the tight correlations between @xmath0 and sfr indicate that young stars should be the major energy source of the radio continuum emission in most of the galaxies , regardless of its thermal or non - thermal origin . in addition ,",
    "the weak and largely scattered @xmath71 correlations ( also consistent with a linear slope ) indicate that old stars traced by near - ir ( k - band ) emission could also contribute .    the tight correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : starburstdefi]b ) indicates that @xmath25 should be a good tracer of the mass of the galaxies .",
    "however , there is no correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath25 , which apparently indicates that the tight @xmath7 and possibly the weak @xmath71 correlations are not only a scaling effect in the sense that larger galaxies have more of everything .",
    "although in most of the cases the distribution of individual galaxies are quite similar on the @xmath71 and @xmath72 relations , the @xmath72 relation indeed has much weaker correlation . no matter we include or remove the most significant outlier ngc  2992 , which has a clearly warped disk potentially affecting the @xmath30 measurement , the correlation coefficient @xmath73 of the @xmath72 relation is close to 0 .",
    "there are several possible reasons which could enlarge the scatter of the @xmath72 relation .",
    "_ first _ , the inclination correction for @xmath30 , which is a key to calculate @xmath25 , is based on the optical inclination angle @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath74 is for the stellar component ( morphologically determined ) and is not necessarily the same as the inclination angle of the gas component ( often kinematically determined ) .",
    "such a difference could add scatter to the derived @xmath25 .",
    "_ second _ , @xmath25 is being derived from a mean relation ( the baryonic tully - fisher relation with the stellar mass measured from the k - band luminosity ; fig .",
    "[ fig : starburstdefi]b ) with a typical scatter of @xmath75 @xcite , which could add some scatter to the @xmath72 relations .",
    "_ third _ , @xmath25 includes the contribution from the h  i gas , which could contribute to the total gravity ( in fact , @xmath25 is derived from @xmath30 which is a direct tracer of the total gravity ) but is not directly related to the sne energy injection .",
    "the lack of correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath25 thus indicates that the weak @xmath71 correlations are really produced by processes related to stellar feedback , instead of a purely gravitational effect as is often important in the x - ray emitting hot halos ( @xcite ) .",
    "_ fourth _ , the rotation velocity of some galaxies are significantly affected by tidal interaction ( e.g. , ngc  2992 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : starburstdefi]b ) .",
    "@xmath25 of these galaxies does not trace their mass .",
    "both young and old stellar populations contribute to the generation of the radio continuum emission .",
    "similar to @xcite , we also combine the contributions of young and old stellar populations to the energy budget by defining a total sn energy injection rate of @xmath76 . in some of the galaxies , especially early - type ones , type  ia sne contribute ( apparently ) @xmath77 of @xmath78 ( table  [ table : galpara ] ) .",
    "these galaxies are quiescent in star formation , and type  ia sne should dominate the overall activity of all ism / cgm phases ( e.g. , ngc  4594 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit @xmath8 relations are : @xmath79 and @xmath80 which also have slightly super - linear slopes at least for l - band ( @xmath9 level ) .",
    "we do not find a significant improvement of the correlation by including the contribution from type  ia sne ( as compared to the correlation with the sfr ) .",
    "such an improvement of the correlation of x - ray emission with @xmath78 is seen by @xcite , possibly because there are more early - type galaxies in @xcite s sample .",
    "we further study the integrated radio spectral index between c- and l - bands ( @xmath39 ; table  [ table : galpara ] ) , which is quite indicative of the origin of the radio continuum emission .",
    "in general , we do not find a clear trend in any relations between @xmath39 and other galaxy properties .",
    "the positive correlation between @xmath39 and the sfr is only marginal ( @xmath81 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : radioratiosfr]a ) .",
    "@xmath39 typically spans a range of @xmath82 , except for several significant outliers which will be further discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : outliers ] .",
    "the relatively low scatter of @xmath39 is also indicated by the extremely tight _ linear _ correlation between the c - band and l - band luminosities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radioratiosfr]b ) , which also indicates that the emission in these two bands are produced by closely related processes .",
    "there is a linear correlation between the point - source - removed truly diffuse halo soft x - ray luminosity and the ir luminosity of _ spiral _ galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this correlation is even preserved on sub - galactic scale ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite further find a significantly improved tight linear correlation between the halo x - ray luminosity and the total ( cc+ia ) sn energy injection rate of the galaxy .",
    "this correlation indicates a roughly constant and extremely low efficiency @xmath83 of converting the sn energy into the halo x - ray emission .",
    "the @xmath8 relations ( fig .",

    "however , whether or not a galactic _ halo _ satisfies the calorimeter condition is still under debate and could be affected by many factors .",
    "thanks to the high sensitivity and angular resolution of the _ jvla _ , we obtain reliable spatially resolved measurements of the _ diffuse _ radio continuum properties of a flux - limited nearby edge - on spiral galaxy sample ( chang - es ; @xcite ) .",
    "the chang - es data enable us , for the first time , to include the galactic radio halo into the energy budget for a statistically meaningful sample . in this paper",
    ", we perform statistical analyses , comparing the integrated diffuse radio continuum luminosity of the whole galaxy ( including both disk and halo ) to other galaxy properties . the milky way is also included for comparison . our main results and their scientific implications are summarized below .",
    "\\(1 ) we compare the c- and l - band radio continuum luminosities to the sfr ( estimated from the spatially - resolved _ wise _ mid - ir photometry ) , stellar mass ( @xmath24 , estimated from the _ 2mass _ near - ir photometry ) , and total baryonic mass ( @xmath25 , estimated from the gas rotation velocity ) of the galaxies .",
    "we find tight @xmath7 and weak @xmath71 correlations , indicating that young stars are the major energy sources of , while old stars could also contribute to , the radio continuum emission .",
    "the lack of @xmath72 correlation further indicates that the @xmath7 and @xmath71 correlations are not only a scaling effect in the sense that larger galaxies have more of everything .",
    "the milky way is in general consistent with the best - fit relations of other galaxies within the scatter .",
    "\\(2 ) we combine the contributions from the energy injection of cc and type  ia sne ( @xmath78 ) , which are proportional to the sfr and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the tight and low - scatter @xmath8 correlations indicate that the radio continuum emission on average accounts for @xmath158 of the total sne energy injection rate .",
    "this radio radiation efficiency is consistent with the expected energy contained in cr electrons , which suggests that the observed radio halo of the chang - es galaxies are very close to a calorimeter of the cr electrons .",
    "\\(3 ) the scatter of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 relations are so small ( @xmath159 of the logarithmic covering range of the parameters ) that we could accurately constrain their logarithmic slopes , which are clearly ( at @xmath9 confidence level ) super - linear in l - band ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 relations , respectively ) while marginally ( within @xmath160 ) consistent with linear in c - band ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 relations , respectively ) .",
    "\\(4 ) the normalization of our @xmath1 relation is typically 2 - 3 times higher than those obtained in some papers based on spatially resolved observations of face - on galaxies , indicating that we have either over - predicted the radio flux or under - predicted the sfr compared to these works .",
    "this discrepancy may plausibly be explained by the enhanced extinction in our edge - on galaxies even in ir , while it could also be affected by the heating of the dust by non - ionizing photons from low - mass stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "\\(5 ) the integrated radio spectral index between c- and l - bands is large ( @xmath6 ) for most of the sample galaxies , apparently consistent with a non - thermal origin from the galaxy - wide diffuse synchrotron emission in both bands .",
    "however , we can not rule out a considerable contribution from the thermal emission , which may add scatter to the measured @xmath39 and also contribute to the spatial variation of the in - band spectral index maps as presented in @xcite .",
    "\\(6 ) based on the halo diffuse soft x - ray luminosity @xmath161 measured with the _ chandra _ , we find sub - linear @xmath14 slopes in both c- and l - bands .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath86 ratio also weakly depends on the sfr . therefore , there is a faster increase of radio continuum emission than x - ray emission with increasing sfr .",
    "\\(7 ) there are several galaxies with radio - bright agn that they show clearly different radio and/or x - ray properties from other galaxies .",
    "they are typically more radio - luminous and have flat radio spectra .",
    "in addition to the contamination from the agn , some of these outliers also exhibit peculiar properties , such as tidal interactions , environmental effects related to the icm , and large contributions from the feedback of type  ia sne . these unusual properties may further affect their radio and x - ray properties .",
    "although the overall energy budget indicates that the galactic radio continuum halo detected by the chang - es observations is close to a calorimeter for cr electrons in order of magnitude , the super - linear slopes of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 relations ( at least in l - band ) are inconsistent with the calorimeter model for the disk . instead , the super - linearity could be naturally reproduced with equipartition non - calorimeter models .",
    "these non - calorimeter models predict a strong dependence of the non - thermal radio emission on the magnetic field strength , which depends on the sfr .",
    "in addition to a higher radio radiation efficiency , the x - ray radiation efficiency may also slightly decrease in intense star forming galaxies ( @xcite ) , helping to produce the sub - linear @xmath14 slopes .",
    "the super - linear radio - ir relation indicates that high - sfr galaxies are closer to calorimeter conditions .",
    "this scenario also predicts that the galaxies are better calorimeters for higher energy electrons because their energy loss via synchrotron radiation is faster than for lower energy electrons .",
    "therefore , there should be a flatter radio - ir relation at higher frequencies .",
    "such a trend is revealed by our results in c- and l - bands , but we could not further confirm it by comparing with archival observations , mainly because of the large diversity in various archival observations .",
    "furthermore , different radio - ir slopes in c- and l - bands also predict a weak dependence of the integrated radio spectral index @xmath39 on the sfr , which is indicated by the weak correlation between them , but the large scatter prevents us from further constraining a well - defined @xmath39-sfr relation .",
    "future observations in broader bands with comparable quality to the chang - es program are needed to confirm the change of the radio - ir slope with the frequency of the radio continuum emission .    * * + the authors would like to thank basu a. , heesen v. , calzetti d. , and the anonymous referee for very helpful discussions and comments .",
