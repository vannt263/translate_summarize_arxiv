    "the so - called knudsen regime in gas dynamics describes a very dilute gas confined between solid walls .",
    "the gas is dilute in the sense that the mean free path of gas molecules , that is , the typical distance travelled between collisions of gas molecules , is much larger than the typical distance between consecutive collisions of the gas molecules with the walls .",
    "hence molecules interact predominantly with the walls , and the interaction among themselves can be neglected .",
    "a typical setting where this is relevant is in the motion of absorbed guest molecules in the pores of a microporous solid where both the pore diameter and the typical number of guest molecules inside the pores are small .    on molecular scale",
    "the wall - molecule interaction is usually rather complicated and very difficult to handle explicitly .",
    "hence one resorts to a stochastic description in which gas molecules , from now on referred to as particles , move ballistically between collisions with the walls where they interact in a random fashion . in the knudsen model",
    "one assumes that particles are pointlike and that the kinetic energy of a particle is conserved in a collision with the wall , but its direction of motion changes randomly .",
    "the law of this random reflection is taken to be the cosine law where the outgoing direction is cosine - distributed relative to the surface normal at the point where the particle hits the wall . for a motivation of this choice ,",
    "sometimes also called lambert reflection law , see @xcite . notice",
    "that this dynamic implies that the incoming direction is not relevant and is `` forgotten '' once a collision has happened .",
    "thus this process defines a markov chain which we call `` knudsen stochastic billiard '' ( ksb ) .",
    "the random sequence of hitting points is referred to as `` knudsen random walk '' ( krw ) @xcite .    pores in microporous solids may have a very complicated surface . among the many possibilities ,",
    "an elongated tube - shaped pore surface has recently attracted very considerable attention @xcite .",
    "a three - dimensional connected network of `` tubes '' may be regarded as constituting the entire ( nonsimply connected ) interior empty space of microporous grain in which particles can move . in this",
    "setting parts of the surface of the individual tubes are open and connect to a neighboring pore so that particles can move from one to another pore .",
    "it is of great interest to study the large scale motion of a molecule along the direction in which the tube has its greatest elongation .",
    "we think of the direction of longest elongation of a single tube as the first coordinate in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space . together with the locally , usually very complicated surface of pores , this leads us to introduce the notion of a random tube with a random surface to be defined precisely below .",
    "knudsen motion in a tube has been studied heuristically for simple regular geometries such as a circular pipe and also numerically for self - similar random surfaces ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the straight infinite pipe ,",
    "it is not difficult to see that in dimensions larger than two , the mean - square displacement grows asymptotically linearly in time , that is , diffusively , while in two dimensions the motion is superdiffusive due to sufficiently large probability for very long flights between collisions . interestingly though , rigorous work on this conceptually simple problem is rare . in fact , it is not even established under which conditions on the pore surface the motion of a knudsen particle has diffusive mean square displacement and converges to brownian motion .",
    "indeed , it is probable that one may construct counterexamples to brownian motion in three or more dimensions without having to invent physically pathological pore surfaces , but considering a nonstationary ( expanding or shrinking ) tube instead .",
    "we refer here to the work @xcite ( there , only the two - dimensional case is considered , but it seems reasonable that one may expect similar phenomena in the general case as well ) . even for the stationary tube , it seems reasonable that the presence of bottlenecks with random ( not bounded away from @xmath1 ) width may cause the process to be subdiffusive .    in this work",
    "we shall define a class of single infinite random tubes for which we prove convergence of ksb and krw to brownian motion . together with related earlier and on - going work , this lays the foundation for addressing more subtle issues that arise in the study of motion in open domains which are finite and which allow for injection and extraction of particles .",
    "this latter problem is of great importance for studying the relation between the so - called self - diffusion coefficient , given by the asymptotic mean square displacement of a particle in an infinite tube under equilibrium conditions , on the one hand , and the transport diffusion coefficient on the other hand .",
    "the transport diffusion coefficient is given by the nonequilibrium flux in a finite open tube with a density gradient between two open ends of the tube .",
    "often only one of these quantities can be measured experimentally , but both may be required for the correct interpretation of other experimental data . hence one would like to investigate whether both diffusion coefficients are equal and specify conditions under which this the case .",
    "this is the subject of a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the question of diffusion in the infinite tube in the absence of fluxes .    for a description of our strategy",
    "we first come to the modeling of the infinite tube .",
    "the tube stretches to infinity in the first direction .",
    "the collection of its sections in the transverse direction can be thought as a `` well - behaved '' function @xmath2 of the first coordinate @xmath3 which values are subsets of @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the boundary of the tube is lipschitz and almost everywhere differentiable , in order to define the process .",
    "we also assume the transverse sections are bounded and that there exist no long dead ends or too thin bottlenecks . for our long - time asymptotics of the walk ,",
    "we need some large - scale homogeneity assumptions on the tube ; it is quite natural to assume that the process @xmath5 is random , stationary and ergodic .",
    "now , the process essentially looks like a one - dimensional random walk in a random environment , defined by random conductances since knudsen random walk is reversible .",
    "the tube serves as a random environment for our walk .",
    "the tube , as seen from the walker , is a markov process which has a ( reversible ) invariant law . from this picture",
    ", we understand that the random medium is homogenized on large scales , and that , for almost every environment , the walk is asymptotically gaussian in the longitudinal direction .",
    "more precisely , we will prove that after the usual rescaling the trajectory of the krw converges weakly to brownian motion with some diffusion constant ( and from this we deduce also the analogous result for the ksb ) .",
    "this will be done by showing ergodicity for the environment seen from the particle and using the classical `` corrector approach '' adapted from @xcite .",
    "the point of view of the particle has become useful @xcite in the study of reversible random walks in a random environment and in obtaining the central limit theorem for the annealed law ( i.e. , in the mean with respect to the environment ) .",
    "the authors from @xcite obtain an ( annealed ) invariance principle for a random walk on a random point process in the euclidean space , yielding an upper bound on the effective diffusivity which agrees with the predictions of mott s law .",
    "the corrector approach , by correcting the walk into a martingale in a fixed environment , has been widely used to obtain the quenched invariance principle for the simple random walk on the infinite cluster in a supercritical percolation @xcite in dimension @xmath6 , @xcite for @xmath7 .",
    "these last two references apply to walks defined by random conductances which are bounded and bounded away from 0 .",
    "the authors in @xcite and @xcite gave a proof under the only condition of bounded conductances .",
    "in this paper we will leave untouched the questions of deriving heat kernel estimates or spectral estimates ( see @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) for the corresponding results for the simple random walk on the infinite cluster .",
    "we will not need such estimates to show that the corrector can be neglected in the limit .",
    "instead we will benefit from the essentially one - dimensional structure of our problem and use the ergodic theorem ; this last ingredient will require introducing reference points in section [ s_refpoints ] below to recover stationarity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s_notations ]",
    "we formally define the random tube and construct the stochastic billiard and the random walk and then formulate our results . in section [ s_environment ] the process of the environment seen from the particle is defined and its properties are discussed .",
    "namely , in section [ s_env_discrete ] we define the process of the environment seen from the discrete - time random walk and then prove that this process is reversible with an explicit reversible measure . for the sake of completeness , we do the same for the continuous - time stochastic billiard in section  [ s_env_continuous ] , even though the results of this section are not needed for the subsequent discussion . in section [ s_constr_corrector ] we construct the corrector function , and in section [ s_refpoints ] we show that the corrector behaves sublinearly along a certain stationary sequence of reference points and that one may control the fluctuations of the corrector outside this sequence . based on the machinery developed in section [ s_environment",
