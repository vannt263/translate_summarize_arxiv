    "with the emergence of various applications , especially multimedia , mobile data has been explosively increasing in recent years .",
    "it is predicted that the mobile traffic will grow by more than 200 to 2000 times in the next few years according to a study from imt 2020 @xcite .",
    "the huge data amount pushes operators to provide high - throughput wireless access services .",
    "however , the current wireless access technology is already quite close to the performance limits and thus new communication strategies are needed to meet the increasing requirement from mobile subscribers .",
    "one promising approach is to use heterogeneous networks @xcite , @xcite , where one cell is divided into multiple small cells , i.e. , microcells , picocells , and femtocells . within each small cell , one _ low - power base station _ ( lpbs )",
    "is equipped to serve the users in coverage .",
    "specially , each lpbs is connected to the _ base station _ ( bs ) of the cell with a backhaul , e.g. , high - speed fiber @xcite .",
    "then , the requested files by a user are first transmitted from the bs to the lpbs through the backhaul and then transmitted from the lpbs to the user .",
    "the deployment of lpbs shortens the wireless transmission distance and results in a spatial gain , which boosts the system throughput dramatically compared with the conventional cellular networks .",
    "however , it may be very expensive to establish and maintain the lpbs as well as the backhaul .",
    "this hinders the application of the heterogeneous networks in practice .",
    "alternatively , wireless caching recently has attracted a lot of attentions for the advantages of fast response and without heavily relying on the backhaul @xcite , @xcite . as observed that some files , e.g. , video clips , usually remain popular in a certain period of time , say one day , one week , even one month . meanwhile , with the fast development of _ integrated circuit _ ( ic ) technologies , the price of storage memory drops quickly .",
    "then , the storage capacity in devices can be utilized for wireless caching .",
    "specifically , some popular files can be cached into the memory of users during the off - load time , say middle night , such that users may obtain the requested files from the devices rather than the bs in the peak - load time , say daytime .",
    "notably , a popular file may be requested by multiple users .",
    "thus , more user requests can be accommodated with the help of wireless caching during the peak - load time .",
    "this increases the system throughput significantly .",
    "besides , high - speed backhauls are not required for the wireless caching since the cached files can be transmitted through wireless channels during the off - load time .    in this paper , we focus on the wireless caching networks with one - hop _ device - to - device _ ( d2d ) communication among users , since d2d communication has been shown to be a promising candidate to improve the system throughput @xcite .",
    "then , some popular files are cached into the memory of users and each user may obtain the requested files from its own memory without any transmission , or from a helper through an one - hop d2d transmission , or from the bs .",
    "we formulate a joint d2d link scheduling and power allocation problem to maximize the system throughput .",
    "however , the problem is non - convex and obtaining an optimal solution is computationally hard . alternatively , we seek to obtain a suboptimal solution with reasonable complexity .",
    "briefly , we intend to schedule the d2d links with strong communication channels and weak interference channels and allocate the power to the scheduled d2d links fairly .",
    "thus , we decompose the joint optimization problem into a d2d link scheduling problem and an optimal power allocation problem . to solve the two subproblems ,",
    "we first develop a d2d link scheduling algorithm to select the largest number of d2d links satisfying both the _ signal to interference plus noise ratio _",
    "( sinr ) and the transmit power constraints .",
    "then , we develop an optimal power allocation algorithm to maximize the minimum transmission rate of the scheduled d2d links .",
    "numerical results indicate that both the number of the scheduled d2d links and the system throughput can be improved simultaneously with the zipf - distribution caching scheme , the proposed d2d link scheduling algorithm , and the proposed optimal power allocation algorithm compared with the state of arts .",
    "_ related literature : _ wireless caching has recently been studied from theoretical perspectives in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite and @xcite study a typical server - user model , where a file server transmits data bits on a shared link ( broadcasting channel ) to satisfy the request of each user .",
    "the objective is to minimize the transmission rate on the shared link .",
    "then , @xcite and @xcite propose centralized and decentralized caching schemes to exploit both local and global caching gains , and thus achieve multiplicative peak rate reduction on the shared link .",
    "@xcite proposes an online coded caching scheme and achieves the order - optimal long - term performance on the shared link .",
    "besides the single - layer caching in @xcite-@xcite , @xcite proposes an order - optimal file placement and delivery scheme for a two - layer wireless caching network .",
    "@xcite generalizes the result in @xcite and studies the multi - requests wireless caching networks , where each user requests more than one files .",
    "then , @xcite proposes a caching scheme based on multiple groupcast index coding and achieves the order - optimal performance . @xcite",
    "extends the result in @xcite and provides the complete order - optimal characterization of the transmission rate on the shard link .",
    "considering the popularity diversity of files , @xcite-@xcite study nonuniform coded caching networks , where files are assumed to have different popularity .",
    "@xcite considers a wireless caching network with one helper and multiple users , and develops an order - optimal coded caching scheme .",
    "@xcite generalizes the result in @xcite to multiple helpers and users , and optimizes the trade - off among the peak rate on the shared link , the memory size in helpers , and the access cost of users .",
    "@xcite divides the popularity of files into several discrete levels and derives an information - theoretic outer bound for the nonuniform network .",
    "different from @xcite , where the peak rate on the shared link is considered , @xcite optimizes the long - term performance .",
    "that is , @xcite considers the average rate on the shared link and develops simple order - optimal schemes . furthermore , @xcite-@xcite study more practical scenarios and design effective caching schemes subject to heterogenous cache sizes , delivery delay constraint , security problem , pricing problem , and streaming schedule problem .    to further improve the system performance ,",
    "d2d communication is proposed for wireless caching @xcite-@xcite .",
    "@xcite considers the d2d communication in wireless caching networks from the perspective of information theory and proposes a deterministic caching scheme and a random caching scheme , both of which may achieve the information theoretic outer bound within a constant multiplicative factor . then , @xcite and @xcite provide the basic principle and system performance of a wireless caching network with d2d communication , and show that the gain from the unicast d2d communication is comparable to the gain from the coded bs multicast .",
    "@xcite proposes a novel architecture to increase the system throughput and obtains the optimal collaboration distance of d2d communication .",
    "different from @xcite-@xcite , where one - hop d2d communication is allowed , @xcite and @xcite consider multi - hop d2d wireless caching networks , where a requested file can be directly obtained through an one - hop d2d transmission or indirectly obtained after multi - hop d2d transmissions .",
    "more specifically , @xcite and @xcite study the throughput scaling law and propose a decentralized caching scheme and a multi - hop d2d transmission scheme . with the schemes ,",
    "the optimal throughput scaling law is achieved and outperforms the scaling law in one - hop d2d communication networks .",
    "_ contributions : _ we adopt the architecture similar to @xcite , where each user may obtain the requested files from its own memory without any transmission , or from a helper through an one - hop d2d transmission , or from the bs . however , our work has three main different aspects from the previous work in @xcite .",
    "firstly , we consider a general conventional model , where any two close users are allowed to establish a d2d link , provided that the requested file of one user is cached in the memory of the other user .",
    "this is different from the cluster - based model in @xcite , where a cell is divided into multiple non - overlapping clusters and only the users in the same cluster are allowed to establish a d2d link .",
    "thus , our proposed algorithm has a relaxed constraint on the location of the users in the cell and can potentially create more d2d communications among users .",
    "secondly , we manage the mutual interference among different d2d links by efficiently scheduling the d2d links and fairly allocating the transmit power .",
    "however , @xcite allows at most one d2d link to work in each cluster to avoid strong interference .",
    "thirdly , we consider the max - min fairness of the scheduled d2d links to achieve perfect fairness and study the optimal power allocation at d2d transmitters .",
    "this is different from @xcite , where the fairness is ignored . as a result ,",
    "the three differences lead to a completely different problem formulation and solution compared with that in @xcite .",
    "to further clarity , our contributions are listed as follows .",
    "* we consider the conventional model , where any two close users are allowed to establish a d2d link provided that the requested file of one user is cached in the memory of the other user .",
    "this creates more d2d communications among users compared with the cluster - based model in @xcite .",
    "* we manage the mutual interference among different d2d links by efficiently scheduling the d2d links and fairly allocating the power allocation instead of dividing a cell into non - overlapping clusters and allowing at most one d2d link in each cluster in @xcite . *",
    "we formulate a joint d2d link scheduling and power allocation problem to maximize the system throughput . due to the non - convexity of the joint optimization problem",
    ", we decompose it into a d2d link scheduling problem and an optimal power allocation problem .",
    "specifically , we intend to first maximize the number of the scheduled d2d links by solving the d2d link scheduling problem and then maximize the minimum transmission rate of the scheduled d2d links by solving the optimal power allocation problem . *",
    "numerical results indicate that both the number of the scheduled d2d links and the system throughput can be improved simultaneously with the zipf - distribution caching scheme , the proposed d2d link scheduling algorithm , and the proposed optimal power allocation algorithm compared with the caching schemes and d2d link scheduling algorithms in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider a cellular network with one bs and @xmath0 users , where the bs is located at the center of a cell and the users are randomly distributed in the cell as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] .",
    "the bs has a file sever and stores @xmath1 files with equal size , whose popularity probability follows zipf distribution @xcite , i.e. , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the file index , and @xmath4 is the file request coefficient and controls the popularity distribution of files .",
    "namely , a large @xmath4 means that the first few files dominate the requests from users .",
    "the file distribution by wireless caching consists of a placement phase and multiple delivery phases . in the placement phase , each user randomly and independently caches one out of @xmath1 files in its memory , according to the zipf - distribution with a file caching coefficient @xmath5 . in each delivery phase",
    ", each user requests one file .",
    "if the requested file of a user can be found in its own memory , the user accesses the file without any transmission . on the other hand ,",
    "if the user can not find the requested file in its own memory , it can request the file either from a helper through an one - hop d2d transmission or from the bs . here",
    ", any user in the cell can be a helper of a requesting user if two conditions are satisfied .",
    "one is that the two users are _ close _ in the cell .",
    "this is , the requesting user is in the help region , which is defined by a help distance @xmath6 around the helper .",
    "this may guarantee small pathloss and small transmit power of a d2d link on average .",
    "the other one is that the requested file is cached in the helper s memory .",
    "it should be noted that , a user may be served by more than one helpers .",
    "then , the helper that can provide the highest transmission rate or sinr will be chosen as a transmitter in a d2d link .",
    "for clarity , the self - access , the one - hop d2d transmission , and the bs transmission are illustrated as dash arrow , dash - dot arrow , and solid arrow in fig .",
    "[ system_model ] , respectively , and the direction of a arrow denotes the transmission direction of a file .",
    "we assume that all the d2d links share one wifi channel and each d2d user works in half - duplex mode and receives or transmits wireless data in one time slot .",
    "we also assume that each user transmits data in the unicast mode and then can not transmit data for multiple users simultaneously .",
    "this can be justified by two facts .",
    "one is that the asynchronous nature of the requested files , e.g. , video clips .",
    "this means that the probability that different users request the same video clip from a common helper at the same time is negligible @xcite .",
    "the other one is that the mobile nature of users .",
    "this makes it very hard to adopt the coded caching schemes which exploit the multicast opportunities between one transmitter and multiple receivers in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , the request of a video clip in most practical systems is implemented by a point to point ( a transmitter to a receiver ) transmission with a dedicated connection @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will evaluate the sinr at d2d receivers .",
    "suppose that @xmath7 users in set @xmath8 can access their requested files from their own memory , and @xmath9 users in set @xmath10 can obtain the requested files either from helpers through one - hop d2d transmissions or from the bs , and @xmath11 users in set @xmath12 can only obtain the requested files from the bs .",
    "define the link through which a user in @xmath10 can obtain the requested file by d2d transmission as a _ potential _ d2d link and denote @xmath13 as the potential d2d link with receiver @xmath14 . without loss of generality ,",
    "if we assume @xmath15 , the potential d2d link set can be denoted as @xmath16 .",
    "suppose that all the users in @xmath10 are scheduled to work simultaneously and that the channel gain between the transmitter of the d2d link @xmath13 ( @xmath17 ) to the receiver of the d2d link @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is @xmath20 .",
    "then , the sinr at the user @xmath14 ( d2d receiver ) is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transmit power of the d2d link @xmath13 and it is subject to the transmit power constraint @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the power of the _ additive white gaussian noise _ ( awgn ) at the receiver @xmath14 . here , we consider _ quality of experience _ ( qoe ) guaranteed d2d transmissions .",
    "thus , the sinr at each d2d receiver is required to be greater than or equal to the minimum acceptable sinr , i.e. , @xmath25 , which is related to the modulated and encoding scheme at each d2d transmitter .",
    "from the previous section , there is a chance that not all the potential d2d links in @xmath26 can be scheduled simultaneously for two reasons .",
    "one reason is that the potential d2d links in @xmath26 may share the same users .",
    "that is , one user may be a d2d transmitter in one potential d2d link and a d2d receiver in another potential d2d link .",
    "then , the two links can not work simultaneously .",
    "the other reason is that , some potential d2d links can not be satisfied with the minimum acceptable sinrs .",
    "thus , we intend to develop a joint d2d link scheduling and power allocation algorithm to maximize the system throughput . formally , we have @xmath27 where the scheduled d2d link set @xmath28 and the corresponding transmit power @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 , are the variables to be optimized , @xmath32 is the d2d transmitter set corresponding to the d2d receivers in @xmath33 , and the constraint @xmath34 guarantees that different scheduled d2d links do not share the same d2d users .",
    "unfortunately , the objective function of @xmath35 is non - convex . to obtain the joint optimal d2d link scheduling and power allocation solution",
    ", the complexity of the exhaustive search is quite high . , where @xmath36 is the maximum transmit power of the d2d link @xmath13 , @xmath37 is the maximum tolerance error of the exhaustive search scheme , and @xmath9 is the number of users that can obtain the requested files either from helpers through one - hop d2d transmissions or from the bs .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 , @xmath39 mw , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "then , the complexity of the exhaustive search is extremely large , i.e. , @xmath42 . ]",
    "alternatively , we seek to obtain a suboptimal solution of @xmath35 with reasonable complexity . briefly , we intend to schedule the d2d links with strong communication channels and weak interference channels and allocate the power to the scheduled d2d links fairly .",
    "thus , we decompose @xmath35 into two subproblems , i.e. , a d2d link scheduling problem and an optimal power allocation problem . for the first subproblem",
    ", we intend to optimize @xmath28 , to maximize the number of d2d links satisfying both the sinr and the transmit power constraints . for the second subproblem",
    ", we intend to optimize @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xmath31 , to maximize the minimum transmission rate of the scheduled d2d links . in what follows",
    ", we will formulate the two subproblems .      to maximize the number of the scheduled d2d links satisfying both the sinr and the transmit power constraints , the d2d link scheduling problem can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the cardinality of @xmath28 and @xmath45 .",
    "it is clear that the solution of ( @xmath46 ) may maximize the number of the scheduled d2d links .",
    "however , scheduling the largest number of d2d links may lead to small system throughput since more d2d links may cause more mutual interference . to deal with this issue",
    ", we introduce a scheduling coefficient @xmath47 ( db ) and replace @xmath45 with @xmath48 .",
    "then , if @xmath49 , we have @xmath45",
    ". then , ( @xmath46 ) maximizes the number of the scheduled d2d links .",
    "as we increase @xmath47 , the sinr constraint ( 7 ) becomes strict , only the d2d links with strong communication channels and weak interference channels are scheduled .",
    "this potentially increases the system throughput .",
    "thus , we can numerically choose the value of @xmath50 to obtain an acceptable number of the scheduled d2d links as well as the system throughput .",
    "_ theorem 1 : _ each transmit power @xmath51 , @xmath52 , increases if any sinr @xmath53 , @xmath54 , in @xmath55 increases .",

    ", problem @xmath55 is equivalent to @xmath56    by solving problem @xmath57 , we may obtain the optimal d2d receiver set @xmath58 and the corresponding d2d link set @xmath59 . without loss of generality , we assume @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "thus , we may improve the minimum transmission rate or the minimum sinr of the scheduled d2d links without compromising @xmath64 , provided that the transmit power constraints of the scheduled d2d links are not violated , i.e. , @xmath66      to solve problem @xmath57 , we shall develop a d2d link scheduling algorithm to select the largest number of d2d links satisfying all the constraints in problem @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , problem @xmath57 is an admission control problem ( i.e. , link scheduling problem ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , it is different from a regular admission control problem . in the regular admission control problem ,",
    "one transmitter has one dedicated receiver . in our system model",
    ", there is a chance that one user is the transmitter in one potential d2d link and the receiver of another potential d2d link .",
    "since the scheduled d2d links can not share the same d2d users , i.e. , the constraint @xmath34 , problem @xmath57 is more complicate than the regular admission control problem and the algorithm for the regular admission control problem can not be directly used to solve problem @xmath57 .",
    "thus , we need to develop a scheduling algorithm to solve problem @xmath57 .",
    "denote the events that any two potential d2d links in a potential d2d link set do not share the same users and that all the minimum sinr constraints in a potential d2d link set can be satisfied as @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath69 and @xmath70 denote the events that @xmath67 and @xmath68 can not be satisfied , respectively .",

    ", problem @xmath57 reduces to a regular admission control problem . to solve this problem ,",
    "the fewest d2d links in @xmath26 shall be removed until @xmath68 can be satisfied .",
    "case iii : @xmath74 . in this case , some d2d links share the same users and are not allowed to work simultaneously . to solve this problem",
    ", we shall first divide the potential d2d links in @xmath26 into different groups ( or subsets ) , such that any two potential d2d links in one group do not share the same users .",
    "after that , each group becomes case i or case ii .    for generality , we will consider case iii for problem @xmath57 in the rest of this paper . by analyzing problem @xmath57 , we have    _ theorem 2 : _",
    "problem @xmath57 is np - hard .",
    "the proof is provided in appendix b.    considering the highly computational complexity of obtaining the optimal solution for a np - hard problem , we will develop an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution of problem @xmath57 in what follows .      once the optimal d2d set @xmath58 is obtained from problem @xmath57 , problem @xmath75 is a feasible max - min optimization problem with transmit power of d2d links as variables .",
    "then , we will first analyze the property of the optimal power allocation of problem @xmath75 and then develop an optimal power allocation algorithm to achieve the optimal performance .",

    "thus , we shall divide the potential d2d links in @xmath26 into different groups , such that different potential d2d links in each group are independent . in this way , problem @xmath57",
    "is decomposed into several subproblems corresponding to different groups . after maximizing the number of the potential d2d links that satisfying both @xmath67 and @xmath68 for each subproblem ( group )",

    "after applying the cpc algorithm and/or the removal algorithm into each group , the largest number of the potential d2d links satisfying both @xmath67 and @xmath68 in each group is obtained . finally , the potential d2d links in the group with the largest number of potential d2d links will be scheduled and other potential d2d links will not be allowed .      to maximize the number of the scheduled d2d links , we shall add as many potential d2d links as possible into each group .",
    "this leads to the fewest groups .",
    "thus , the division of the potential d2d links can be transferred to an edge coloring problem in graph theory , where the edges in a graph are colored with the fewest colors while guaranteeing that any two edges sharing the same vertex are colored differently .",

    "one direction of the future work is to develop decentralized algorithms of scheduling and power allocation in the d2d assisted wireless caching networks .",
    "to prove theorem 1 , we will first prove part i : each transmit power @xmath51 , @xmath52 , increases if any sinr @xmath53 , @xmath54 , in @xmath55 increases .",
    "then , we will prove part ii : the value of @xmath44 remains constant or decreases if any sinr @xmath53 , @xmath54 , in @xmath55 increases .",
    "suppose that there is a power increment @xmath291 and a sinr increment @xmath292 for d2d link @xmath13 in @xmath28 such that @xmath293 then , there must be a sinr decrement @xmath294 for any other d2d link @xmath18 ( @xmath295 ) such that @xmath296 to remain the sinr @xmath297 at d2d link @xmath18 , @xmath298 ( @xmath299 ) will be increased by @xmath300 , such that @xmath301 thus , each @xmath298 , @xmath302 increases if there is an increment of any @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "suppose that the d2d links in @xmath303 satisfy all the constraints in problem @xmath55 with transmit power @xmath304 .",
    "if there is a sinr increment @xmath292 at d2d link @xmath13 , the transmit power should be increased to @xmath305 to satisfy all the minimum acceptable sinrs .",
    "if @xmath306 , @xmath52 , all the d2d links in @xmath303 can still be satisfied with the minimum sinr constraints and number of the scheduled d2d links remains . if there exists a @xmath300 ( @xmath307 ) satisfying @xmath308 and @xmath309 then , the d2d link @xmath18 can not be satisfied with the minimum sinr constraint .",
    "this reduces the number of the scheduled d2d transmissions .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "the regular admission control problem with qos constraint has been proved to be np - hard in @xcite and is a special case ( case ii ) of problem @xmath57 .",
    "specifically , the problem @xmath57 reduces to a regular admission control problem when any two d2d links in @xmath303 do not share the same users .",
    "thus , problem @xmath57 is also np - hard .      in this part",
    ", we will prove theorem 3 .",
    "firstly , we will give the proof of the first case that there is a user @xmath14 ( @xmath310 ) satisfying @xmath311 but not satisfying @xmath185 , and prove that the optimal sinrs of the scheduled d2d links is @xmath312 $ ] , where @xmath313 .",
    "then , we will provide the proof of the second second case that if @xmath314 holds , the optimal sinrs of the scheduled d2d links is @xmath315 $ ] , where @xmath316 .",
