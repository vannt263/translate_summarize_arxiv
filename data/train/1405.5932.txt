    "in this paper , we study stabilization of uncertain discrete - time linear systems over communication channels . due to the use of channels , the amount of information transmitted through a channel at a time step , or the data rate , is limited to a finite number . in real systems , the rates are finite because of the limitations on bandwidths and resolutions of sensors . as a consequence",
    "the controller may not have access to the exact plant states but only their approximated values are given at each step .",
    "clearly , such communication constraints may be harmful and can cause degradation in control performance . in the pioneering work of @xcite , it has been shown that there exists a critical value in the data rate to stabilize a feedback system over channels , and moreover the value depends only on the product of the unstable poles of the open - loop system .",
    "this result has motivated researchers to derive general minimum data rate theorems @xcite and to extend them to various problems including stabilization of stochastic systems @xcite and nonlinear systems @xcite , control with shared channels among multiple nodes @xcite , and time - varying data rate constraints @xcite ( see also the survey paper @xcite ) . moreover , it is interesting that several works have pointed out that notions and tools in information theory are useful in the analysis of data rate limited control problems . in @xcite , rate distortion theory",
    "is employed to deal with the linear quadratic gaussian problem over a channel . in @xcite ,",
    "an entropy - based approach has been established to study performance limitations on disturbance rejection .",
    "the main feature of this paper is that we take account of uncertainties in plant models .",
    "control of uncertain networked systems has been discussed in several recent works . in @xcite ,",
    "linear time - invariant systems with norm bounded uncertainties are considered , while in @xcite scalar systems ( state variables are scalars ) with nonlinear terms , stochastic uncertainties , and disturbances are dealt with .",
    "though sufficient conditions on data rates are obtained , these results do not characterize the minimum rate .",
    "another related problem in networked control is stabilization based on the so - called logarithmic quantizers @xcite ; uncertain plants have been studied in @xcite and @xcite from robust control and adaptive control viewpoints , respectively .",
    "the focus of our study is to derive limitations on the data rates necessary for stabilization of uncertain systems . in particular ,",
    "the limitation is characterized by the level of plant instability as in the data rate theorems mentioned above and is expressed in terms of data rates and the uncertainty bounds on plant parameters . under the presence of uncertainties , in general ,",
    "this is a difficult problem .",
    "the reason is that the combination of plant uncertainties and the nonlinearity in the system due to quantization complicate the analysis of state evolutions . in this paper , to overcome such difficulties , we formulate the problem based on two ideas as follows .",
    "first , we assume that the plant is a single - input and single - output system , and its uncertainties are parametric . in the analysis of such a system ,",
    "the product of poles of the nominal plant can be expressed as a single parameter , which corresponds to the constant term in the denominator polynomial of the transfer function ; for the case of known plants , this viewpoint has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomial lie somewhere within known bounds , and in this sense the plant is parametrically uncertain . in the context of robust control ,",
    "parametrically uncertain systems have been extensively studied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the celebrated kharitonov s theorem @xcite provides an exact condition for robust stability for continuous - time systems , though its extensions to discrete - time systems are somewhat limited .",
    "the second idea to tackle the uncertain systems case is the introduction of some structure into the controller by imposing restriction on the state estimation scheme .",
    "it is important to note that this controller class includes those that have appeared in minimum data rate results for known plants for derivation of sufficient conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore , when specialized to the case without uncertainties , our results coincide with those in such previous works .",
    "an interesting aspect in the uncertain case is that the quantizer used in the encoder should not be restricted to the conventional uniform quantizers as in @xcite .",
    "we propose a new quantizer , which is in fact designed to compensate plant uncertainties and is capable of reducing the required data rate . indeed , for scalar plants",
    ", this quantizer becomes optimal in the sense that it minimizes the required data rate .",
    "this quantizer is a piecewise constant function whose step width shrinks as the input becomes larger in magnitude . in the special case of known plants , it becomes uniform , which supports the use of uniform quantizers in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec , problem ] , we describe the setup of the networked control system and formally state the stabilization problem that we consider .",
    "next , in section [ sec , nec ] , we present our first main result , which characterizes the minimum data rate for uncertain plants .",
    "sections [ sec , gnec ] and [ sec , opt_q ] are devoted to provide key lemmas and the proof of the first main result ; in section [ sec , gnec ] , a lower bound on the expansion rate of the state estimations set is analyzed and the optimal quantizer which can achieve the lowest expansion rate is provided in section [ sec , opt_q ] . in section [ sec , suf ] , a sufficient bound on the data rate is obtained by constructing a specific control scheme .",
    "tightness of the presented limitations is discussed in section [ sec , scalar ] .",
    "we show the cases that the necessary condition and the sufficient condition become tight and less conservative than those presented in the existing results . in sections",

    "the quantized signal @xmath4 is transmitted to the decoder through the finite data rate channel .",

    ", we describe the details of each component in the system .",

    "the encoder quantizes the plant output @xmath10 into the @xmath6-alphabet signal @xmath4 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the input range of the encoder is centered at the origin and the width is defined by a scaling parameter @xmath30 . in particular , the output @xmath8 of the encoder is given as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a static @xmath6-level quantizer whose input range is @xmath33 $ ] . in the quantizer @xmath34 , it is assumed that boundaries of the quantization cells are symmetric about the origin .",
    "this assumption is introduced to avoid complexity in the analysis regarding how large the state estimation sets generated by quantized information become . by its symmetry ,",

    "we remark that the scaling parameter @xmath53 should be large enough to cover all possible inputs to the encoder . otherwise , the quantizer may be saturated , in which case we lose track of the plant output @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we take @xmath53 large , the quantization error also becomes large .",
    "moreover , to achieve stabilization of the system , @xmath53 should decay to zero gradually .",
    "we determine the scaling parameter @xmath53 as follows . at time @xmath2",
    ", the encoder and the decoder predict the next plant output @xmath54 based on the observed @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 be the set of all possible outputs @xmath54 of the uncertain system ( [ ar ] ) .",
    "then the scaling parameter @xmath57 is chosen such that @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the lebesgue measure on @xmath52 .",

    "then , clearly , @xmath66 is large enough to include @xmath54 , and is computable on both sides of the channel .",
    "the control objective is to robustly stabilize the networked control system depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig , system ] for all possible parameters within the bounds in ( [ uncertainty ] ) .",
    "the problem setup is particularly affected by the consideration of uncertain plants . to overcome the difficulties due to the uncertainty",
    ", we have introduced some structures in the plant as well as the controller . in the plant ( [ ar ] ) , the product of the poles is represented as a single parameter @xmath67 . as we mentioned in section",
    "[ sec , intro ] , the product of the poles plays an important role to describe the bounds on the data rate . since our objective is to characterize the bounds by the product of the poles , the simple expression of the key parameter helps to reduce the complexity in the analysis .",
    "similarly , the classes of controllers ( [ controller ] ) and prediction sets ( [ def , caly^- ] ) are employed to pursue an analytical approach and , in particular , to obtain necessary limitations in an explicit formula . here",
    ", we use the information regarding @xmath68 independently .",
    "this may make the state estimation somewhat conservative . on the other hand , in related works ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite , the controller can be an arbitrary causal function .",
    "if we use a more general controller or a prediction method that allows us to look at the correlations among them , then the estimation sets @xmath69 from times before the current time @xmath2 may be updated so that they shrink in size . as a result",

    "we note that it may be possible to minimize the state estimation sets numerically @xcite ; however , in the case of uncertain plants , it is difficult to do this analytically . here ,",

    "furthermore , the equality holds since @xmath74 , @xmath75 , are connected intervals in @xmath52 by the definitions in ( [ uncertainty ] ) and ( [ def , caly ] ) .",
    "in this section , we consider the quantizer ( [ def , q ] ) using a fixed number @xmath6 of quantization cells . under the setup",
    ", we present a lower bound on the data rate @xmath76 as a necessary condition for the system to be stable .",
    "the bound is expressed by the level of instability and uncertainty in the plant .",
    "it is important to note that the previous works @xcite dealing with uncertainties have studied only sufficient conditions which contain some conservativeness .    before providing the result",

    "@xcite , the data rate bounds are expressed only by the poles outside the unit circle . in these works ,",
    "the states corresponding to the stable poles have been omitted by applying transformation of the state coordinate . however ,",
    "if the plant parameters contain uncertainties , we can not make such a transformation .",
    "if the plant has any stable modes , the limitation on the data rate given below necessarily becomes loose .    to describe the main result in this section ,",
    "we introduce the following notation : @xmath79    we are now ready to present the necessity result for the static data rate case .",
    "[ th , nec ] under assumption  [ asm , instability ] , if the system in fig .",
    "[ fig , system ] is stable with the static quantizer ( [ def , q ] ) , then it holds that @xmath80    one can confirm that the lower bound @xmath81 on data rate is monotonically increasing with respect to @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "thus , more unstable dynamics or more uncertainty in the plant will result in higher requirement in communication with a larger data rate .",
    "we remark that there is no gap between the two expressions in ( [ nec , r ] ) since @xmath81 is right continuous with respect to @xmath83 at @xmath84 .    for the special case where no plant uncertainty , i.e. , @xmath85 for @xmath75 , the bound @xmath81 takes the well - known form @xmath86 .",
    "in addition , if all poles lie outside of the unit circle , this bound coincides with those given in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that for an uncertain plant with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the following inequality holds : @xmath89}\\log|{\\lambda_{a}}|.\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , even if we assume the most conservative plant dynamics within ( [ uncertainty ] ) , the bound for the known plants case is looser than the necessary data rate bound @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , we remark that for the uncertain plants such that @xmath90 , we have that @xmath91}\\log|{\\lambda_{a}}|$ ] .",
    "however , we can not construct a quantizer achieving @xmath92 since this implies that the number of the quantization cells @xmath6 is less than @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the case of @xmath90 may be less interesting from a practical viewpoint . in the following example",
    ", we compare the necessary limitation @xmath81 with the result for known plants to confirm the gap between the two bounds .",
    "[ ex , neccomparison ] consider a plant with @xmath94 .",

    "note that the bounds do not depend on the parameters @xmath97 .",
    "due to the uncertainty , the bound for known plants varies within the area bounded by the dotted lines .",
    "however , there exists a gap between the solid line and the upper dotted line .",
    "hence , the limitations for known plants are insufficient in the presence of uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , we observe that when @xmath92 the upper dotted line is greater than the solid line as we mentioned above .",
    "the work @xcite shows another special case of theorem  [ th , nec ] . for the case when the quantizer is uniform",

    "therefore , we may stabilize the system with a lower data rate by using a quantizer that is not uniform but more general .",
    "the proof of the theorem  [ th , nec ] will be presented in the following two sections . throughout the proof",
    ", the central question is as follows : under the situation where the estimation set of the plant state becomes large due to instability , at least how precise is the quantization required to be to make the estimation set gradually small ? to answer this question , in section  [ sec , gnec ] , we evaluate the expansion rate of the estimation set for a given quantizer .",
    "we focus on the effect of @xmath98 on the expansion of the estimation set , since @xmath98 is equal to the product of the poles of the plant .",

    "it is easy to verify that @xmath249 and @xmath250 .",
    "hence , our result is tighter than the known bounds @xmath251 and @xmath252 . it should be noted that , for general order plants , it is difficult to compare theorem  [ th , suf ] with the bounds in @xcite and @xcite since the types of uncertainties are different : in @xcite , unstructured uncertainties have been considered , and it is hard to describe the data rate limitation in an explicit form , while in @xcite , scalar nonlinear plants have been studied and the multi - dimensional case has not been investigated",

    "we note that in the literature there are two types of communication schemes with variable data rates .",
    "the first type is the one considered here and also in @xcite . under the scheme , for every time step , the output is observed and the control input is applied . on the other hand , another communication scheme has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is as follows : divide the time into cycles of a certain duration . at the initial step of each cycle , the encoder observes the output and then sends it slowly during the cycle . at the end of the cycle , the controller estimates the plant state and generates the input using the received information regarding the state data of the state from the initial time of the cycle . except the last steps of the cycles , the control input is kept as zero .",
    "it is interesting that when the plant is known , these two schemes provide the same bound on the data rate , but for uncertain plants , the bounds are different .",
    "this is because in the latter scheme , the plant uncertainty causes accumulation of error in the state estimation , which affects the accuracy in the control input , since only the information at the beginning of the cycle is used .",
    "when the plant has no uncertainty , the proof of theorem  [ th , necm ] follows in a straightforward manner from that of theorem  [ th , nec ] .",
    "however , in the case of uncertain plants , we need a few additional steps . as in the the static data rate case , the nonuniform quantizer @xmath206 in ( [ q*_optimal ] ) will be shown to be optimal in the derivation , but its complex definition brings some analytical difficulties",
