    "parameterization of orthogonal and biorthogonal filters has been an important topic of research in the context of wavelet analysis ( for the relation between filters and wavelets see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "pioneering works in this area have been carried out , for example , by pollen @xcite and holschneider @xcite , who proposed parameterizations based on _ loop group factorization_. later sweldens @xcite introduced the _ lifting scheme _ which is now widely used to construct biorthogonal families of filters . for yet another interesting approach to the explicit construction of wavelet filters based on their correspondence with representations of the so - called cuntz relations we refer the reader , for instance , to @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the approach given in @xcite to the construction of an infinite family of orthogonal perfect reconstruction _",
    "matrix filter banks _ of _ full rank _ type .",
    "these kinds of filters , introduced in @xcite , are associated to the _ multichannel wavelet analysis _ of signals which are vector - valued , consisting of several components typically associated to different channels .",
    "signals of this type arise naturally in many application contexts ; typical examples are : brain activity ( eeg / meg ) data , colour images , multisensor data , financial time series , etc .",
    "a classical scalar wavelet analysis applied the single components of this kind of data might not be appropriate , because it ignores the possible correlation among the channels .",
    "multichannel wavelets provide a more effective tool , able to process such type of signals as ",
    "complete  vectors , so to extract peculiar information from the overall behaviour of the components and to reveal / exploit inter - correlations .",
    "the main challenge in the context of multichannel wavelet analysis is the construction of matrix filters satisfying the _ quadrature mirror filter _ ( _ qmf _ ) condition . in particular ,",
    "the direct construction of the filter associated to the matrix scaling function from the qmf constraints is not convenient because of their non - linear nature . on the other hand ,",
    "a daubechies - like approach only gives rise to filters which are essentially diagonal , in the sense that they can be reduced , via similarity transformations , to scalar schemes . in @xcite",
    "a construction of orthogonal matrix refinable functions has been proposed as a spectral factorization problem , based on the connection between orthogonal and interpolatory matrix subdivision schemes .",
    "nevertheless this approach can not in principle give rise to any closed parameterized form of the filters . as to the construction of the corresponding wavelet filter , unlike the scalar case",
    ", there is no trivial alternating flip trick to express it in terms of the scaling function filter , due to the non - commutative nature of the matrix filter context .",
    "the numerical scheme presented in @xcite is an example of effective numerical approach to the problem , which , nevertheless , relies on the a priori knowledge of the scaling filter .    in this work ,",
    "we address both the problems ( construction of the scaling function and of the wavelet ) at the same time , by deriving a procedure which provides a natural and intrinsic characterization of ( quasi ) all matrix qmf filters .",
    "the main idea is to exploit the one - to - one correspondence between matrix qmf filters and orthogonal operators that commute with translations by 2 , so that starting with a trivial system and repeatedly applying such type of operators it is possible to produce large classes of filters .",
    "it is important to point out that the qmf filter construction in the matrix case can be viewed also in a multiwavelet perspective ( see , for example , @xcite ) , but all the constructions proposed for this kind of bases do not take into account the full rank requirement ( since multiwavelets still generate multiresolution analyses for spaces of scalar rather than vector - valued functions ) . our construction , on the other hand ,",
    "can be straightforwardly applied to the realization of multiwavelet bases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents some preliminaries and notation . in section 3",
    "we give a detailed exposition of our construction and a characterization result .",
    "finally , in section 4 we examine the particular case of dimension 2 providing explicit descriptions of families of parameterized filters , in particular those associated to the representation of the lie group of rotations in terms of infinitesimal generators .",
    "by @xmath3 , @xmath4 , we denote the space of square - summable @xmath5matrix valued sequences , that is @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the @xmath8-norm on the matrix space @xmath9 . for notational simplicity",
    "we write @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .    for two matrix sequences",
    "@xmath14 , we define the _ inner product _ as @xmath15 and we say that the two sequences are _ orthogonal _ to each other if @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the @xmath18 matrix all of whose entries are zero .    in particular , given two vector sequences @xmath19^t : \\ , k\\in { \\mathbb{z}}\\right ) $ ] , @xmath20^t : \\ , k\\in { \\mathbb{z}}\\right ) $ ] in @xmath10 , then their inner ( scalar ) product is : @xmath21    for @xmath22 , we define the _ dirac delta sequence _ @xmath23 as the sequence whose elements satisfy : @xmath24    if @xmath22 , we introduce the _ translation _ and _ downsampling _ operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 acting on a sequence @xmath27 respectively as : @xmath28 the transpose of the downsampling operator is the _ upsampling operator _ , described by the action @xmath29    the @xmath0 identity matrix is denoted with @xmath30 , and its columns , representing the canonical basis in @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .",
    "two filters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are said to define a _ matrix qmf ( quadrature mirror filter ) system _ , if they satisfy the _ orthonormality conditions _ : @xmath35 @xmath36 which , using the inner product notation , may be written as : @xmath37 for a signal @xmath38 the application of a matrix valued filter is defined in the natural way through the _ convolution _ operation : @xmath39 a qmf system provides a perfect analysis / reconstruction scheme through the following two equations : @xmath40 here we have used the notation @xmath41 .    instead of working with matrix valued functions we may also take the following equivalent picture by considering vector valued sequences . in analogy to the scalar case ,",
    "a qmf filter system is generated by the dilates and translates of @xmath42 vector - valued function @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , satisfying the orthonormality property : @xmath45 the collection of all these functions is then an orthonormal basis of @xmath46 .",
    "we identify these vectors with the previously introduced matrix valued signal by taking them as their column vectors ( analogue for @xmath47 ) : @xmath48= \\sum_{j=1}^d { { { \\boldsymbol{a}}}_j } \\ , { { \\boldsymbol{e}}}_j^t.\\ ] ] the decomposition and synthesis of a signal in @xmath49 with respect to this orthonormal basis can then be obtained with the filters @xmath33 and @xmath34 as in ( [ eq : qmranalysisreconstruction ] ) .",
    "we conclude this section by introducing a crucial feature which is required to a matrix qmf system to be connected to a proper wavelet analysis context .",
    "a qmf system is said to satisfy the _ full rank condition _ if the sequence @xmath33 satisfies : @xmath50 this , in particular , implies that the coefficients of the sequence @xmath34 sum up to the zero matrix .",
    "it can be shown , that full rank is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for these filters to actually define a _",
    "multichannel multiresolution analysis _",
    "@xcite , which is a natural extension of the well - known multiresolution analysis to vector - valued functions .",
    "any ( orthogonal ) multichannel mra is , in fact , generated by two square - integrable @xmath0-matrix valued functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 , representing , respectively , the matrix scaling function and the multichannel wavelet , satisfying the _ matrix two - scale relations _ : @xmath53 in such context , the two - scale coefficient sequences @xmath33 , @xmath34 define a matrix qmf system and must possess the full rank property . in particular , this is related to the fact that the matrix wavelet @xmath52 has _ vanishing zeroth moment _ :",
    "@xmath54 we remark that , as in the scalar case , further @xmath55 vanishing moments ( usually required in applications ) can be possessed by @xmath52 , that is , @xmath56 only if the coefficients in the sequence @xmath33 satisfy the additional _ sum rule conditions _ : @xmath57",
    "the basic idea of the construction is easiest explained in the well known qmf setting of a scalar valued signal .",
    "let @xmath58 , @xmath59 be such that the set of translates by @xmath60 : @xmath61 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath62 , so that the two sequences form a qmf system .",
    "note that the distinction between @xmath58 and @xmath63 is somehow arbitrary . however in actual filtering applications one would like @xmath58 to be the scaling function filter and @xmath63 to be the wavelet filter .",
    "this would impose additional constraints ( vanishing moments , etc ) on these sequences .    a trivial example of a qmf system in this purely algebraic setting would be @xmath64 consider now an orthogonal linear operator @xmath65 acting in @xmath62 with the property that it commutes with the shifts by @xmath8 , that is : @xmath66:=ut_2-t_2u=0.\\ ] ] since @xmath65 is orthogonal , the image of the basis ( [ eq : basis ] ) is again a basis . since @xmath65 commutes with the shifts by @xmath8 , it has the following structure @xmath67 therefore this basis is again a qmf system .",
    "vice versa , any qmf system can be obtained from the trivial system in this way .",
    "indeed , there is exactly one linear operator such that : @xmath68 since any linear operator is defined by its image of a basis .",
    "therefore there is an explicit one - to - one correspondence between qmf filters and orthogonal operators that commute with translations by 2 .",
    "note that any such operator is defined through its image of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the finite impulse response ( fir ) filters correspond exactly to those operators which leave invariant the non closed linear subspace of compactly supported sequences .",
    "therefore , if we can construct a manifold of such operators , we automatically have a family of qmf by applying them to any known qmf , in particular the trivial one \\{@xmath69 , @xmath70}.    a family of such operators can be obtained in the following way ( see fig  [ schema ] ) .",
    "pick an arbitrary @xmath71 orthogonal matrix @xmath72 .",
    "let the image of @xmath69 be its first column put at positions @xmath73 , @xmath74 extended with zeros on both sides .",
    "let the image of @xmath70 be the second column , put at positions @xmath73,@xmath74 and extended with zeros on both sides : @xmath75 then extend mapping to a linear operator to all of @xmath62 by requiring that it commutes with the shift by two .",
    "this defines the operator @xmath76 .    to put it differently : for",
    "a sequence @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 , apply the same orthogonal matrix @xmath80 to the vectors @xmath81^t$ ] , @xmath82 .",
    "it is plain that this linear operator conserves the norm and that it satisfies the commutation property .",
    "now , instead of taking this grouping , we may also consider the grouping @xmath83^t$ ] .",
    "this defines a new operator , @xmath84 , which can also be written as @xmath85 the product of two such operators is again orthogonal and satisfies the commutation property .",
    "thus , for any finite sequence of matrices @xmath86 , @xmath87 , we have an operator @xmath88 with @xmath89 , that can applied in order to obtain a parameterization of a family of qmf .    in this case",
    "this parameterization is actually complete .",
    "indeed , for a qmf of length @xmath90 the outermost blocks are all orthogonal to each other as follows from the orthonormality relations .",
    "therefore , the spaces spanned by the left block of the @xmath58 sequence and the left block of the @xmath63 sequence are collinear .",
    "the same holds for the right blocks .",
    "since they are orthogonal , there is a rotation such that the outermost coefficients can be sent to zero and thereby the length of the qmf sequence is reduced by @xmath8 .",
    "this gives an induction argument for proving the completeness of the parameterization .",
    "a further generalization is possible .",
    "consider any fundamental domain @xmath91 for the quotient group @xmath92 . by applying the same matrix operation to the grouping defined by @xmath91",
    ", we obtain again a linear operator that conserves the norm and commutes with the shifts by @xmath8 .",
    "thus , for any sequence of fundamental domains and orthogonal matrices , we may consider the product @xmath93 it is clear that the same construction can be used to obtain all complex valued filters .",
    "it is enough to replace the orthogonal group and the orthogonal matrices by the unitary analogous .",
    "we now extend the construction of such operators to the vector case .",
    "as in the previous section , we may identify orthogonal operators in @xmath46 that commute with @xmath94 and qmf systems .",
    "the trivial vector qmf system is given by @xmath95 pick now a matrix @xmath96 .",
    "we identify @xmath97 submatrices @xmath98.\\ ] ] the orthogonal operator defined in @xmath46 is acting on the sequences as follows : @xmath99 again we extend this to all of @xmath46 by requiring that the operator commutes with @xmath94 .    in the language of blocks , this operator acts on a vector - valued signal @xmath100 as follows . for each @xmath101",
    ", we identify the two vectors @xmath102 and @xmath103 with the @xmath42-dimensional vector @xmath104^t$ ] .",
    "the operation on the two vectors in the block is now multiplication with the matrix @xmath80 .",
    "a second family is obtained by considering , for example , the grouping @xmath105 which corresponds to another fundamental domain of @xmath106 . as before these operations may be combined to obtain a family of such operators and , a fortiori , a family of matrix filters .",
    "more precisely , in matrix notation , starting from a matrix qmf system @xmath107 we apply a matrix @xmath96 to the sequence @xmath108 : \\",
    ", n \\in { \\mathbb{z}}\\right)\\ ] ] or to the sequence @xmath109 : \\ , n \\in { \\mathbb{z}}\\right)\\ ] ] and recursively do the same operation to the transformed sequences .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the description of the qmf systems in terms of _",
    "symbols_. for this , we associate with the matrix filter @xmath33 the laurent series matrix @xmath110 which in fact is a laurent polynomial matrix , if we assume that the filter has finite support .    the so called _ subsymbols _ are defined through @xmath111 and the following relation holds between the symbol and the subsymbols : @xmath112 consider now also the symbol @xmath113 of the wavelet filter and the respective subsymbols @xmath114 , @xmath115 and define the following @xmath116 polynomial matrix : @xmath117,\\ ] ] which is also known as the _ polyphase matrix_.    then the qmf conditions can be written as @xmath118^h { { \\boldsymbol{l}}}(z^2)=2{{\\boldsymbol{i}}},\\ ] ] while the full rank requirement is equivalent to @xmath119.\\ ] ] straightforward computations show that the operator @xmath120 and the translation operator @xmath121 are respectively acting on the symbols as follows : @xmath122 @xmath123 { { \\boldsymbol{l}}}(z),\\ ] ] so that the operator described in ( [ eq : shiftop ] ) takes the following form in terms of symbols : @xmath124 { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}\\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }   { { \\boldsymbol{0 } } } & { { \\boldsymbol{i}}}\\\\ z^{-1 } { { \\boldsymbol{i } } } & { { \\boldsymbol{0}}}\\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] given a sequence of matrices @xmath125 , @xmath126 , by alternately applying ( [ eq : symbop ] ) and ( [ eq : symbshiftop ] ) to the matrix @xmath127 , we obtain the following family of qmf symbols : @xmath124   { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}_k \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }   { { \\boldsymbol{0 } } } & { { \\boldsymbol{i}}}\\\\   z^{-1}{{\\boldsymbol{i } } } & { { \\boldsymbol{0}}}\\end{array } \\right ]    \\ , \\cdots \\ , { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}_2 \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }   { { \\boldsymbol{0}}}&z { { \\boldsymbol{i}}}\\\\   { { \\boldsymbol{i } } } & { { \\boldsymbol{0}}}\\end{array } \\right ] { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}_1 \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }   { { \\boldsymbol{0 } } } & { { \\boldsymbol{i}}}\\\\   z^{-1}{{\\boldsymbol{i } } } & { { \\boldsymbol{0}}}\\end{array } \\right ] { { \\boldsymbol{m}}}_0\\ , { { \\boldsymbol{l}}}(z).\\ ] ]    we conclude the section by giving an almost characterization of the set of matrix qmf that can be obtained using the above construction .",
    "let @xmath128 be the smallest interval that contains the support of all sequences in the qmf system .",
    "the even blocks correspond to grouping the elements with indices in @xmath129 whereas the odd blocks are the one with @xmath130 .",
    "the outermost blocks of an even or odd covering of @xmath131 are the left most and right most that intersect the support .",
    "the dimension of a block is defined to be the dimension of the vector space generated by the @xmath42 vectors with indices in the block .",
    "all qmf systems that can be obtained through this construction have the dimension of their outermost blocks @xmath132 .",
    "vice versa all matrix qmf system of finite support length for which the dimension of outermost block is equal to @xmath133 can be obtained through this construction .    for length equal to @xmath8",
    "nothing has to be proved .    that the dimensions of the outermost blocks are at most @xmath133 is clear , since it is obtained by applying a linear map to a vector space of dimension at most @xmath133 .",
    "vice versa , suppose that the outermost blocks for either an even or odd covering are each @xmath133 dimensional . by orthogonality of the basic vector sequences , all the extremal blocks on the left",
    "are orthogonal to all the extremal blocks on the right .",
    "since the dimension of each of these blocks is @xmath133 it is possible to find an orthogonal matrix such that the left block is mapped into a block having only zeros to the left , and the right block is mapped into a blocking having zeros to the right .",
