    "dark matter constitutes the most abundant type of matter in our universe and its density is now experimentally well - determined @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "worldwide efforts to constrain its nature and interactions have led the community to a puzzling situation where null results coexist with direct detection experiments that find high significance excesses @xcite . in particular , in the low mass region of dm candidates",
    "i.e. @xmath1 , cosmological , astrophysical and collider constraints seem to be the most important , see for example a discussion in @xcite .",
    "direct detection searches of thermalized galactic dm are mostly based on nuclear recoils on selected targets . in this scenario",
    ", ldm particles with masses much smaller than that of the nucleon , @xmath2 , can only provide energies @xmath3 ev which are below the @xmath3kev threshold for conventional terrestrial searches .",
    "if one , instead , considers ldm scattering off bound electrons , energy transfer can cause excitation or even ionization and thus seems promising for exploring the phase space in a complementary way in the near future @xcite .",
    "dm hitting terrestrial targets is expected to have low velocities @xmath4 ( we use @xmath5 units ) as the gravitational boost is small for the earth i.e. its lorentz factor @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "however , for compact objects , such as neutron stars ( nss ) with masses @xmath8 and radius @xmath9 km , @xmath10 or @xmath11 and thus provides a mechanism to boost particles to higher velocities or , accordingly , test the same length scales with smaller projectile masses .",
    "in particular , the outer crusts in nss are formed by periodically arranged nuclei with typical densities ranging from @xmath12 @xmath13 . in the single - nucleus description @xcite , a series of nuclei with increasing baryonic number , @xmath14 , from fe to kr form a lattice before neutrons start to leak out of nuclei . at these high densities ,",
    "electrons form a degenerate fermi sea . at even larger densities and up to nuclear saturation density , around @xmath15 @xmath13 ,",
    "a number of different nuclear structures called _ pasta _ phases appear @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the effect of ldm scattering in the production of quantized lattice vibrations ( phonons ) in the outer ns crust .",
    "later , we will discuss how this result can impact subsequent quantities of interest , such as the ion thermal conductivity , that are relevant for computing the cooling behavior of nss .",
    "phonons are quantized vibrational modes characterized by a momentum @xmath16 and polarization vector @xmath17 appearing in a nuclear periodic system @xcite .",
    "they can have a number of different sources .",
    "they can be excited due to non - zero temperature @xmath18 in the medium .",
    "the debye temperature allows us to evaluate the importance of the ion motion quantization . for a bcc lattice @xcite , for example , @xmath19 , being @xmath20 the plasma temperature associated to a medium of ions with number density @xmath21 , baryonic number @xmath14 , electric charge @xmath22 and mass @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the boltzmann constant . at low temperatures @xmath25 ,",
    "the quantization becomes increasingly important and the thermal phonons produced are typically acoustic modes , following a linear dispersion relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the sound speed . in addition , phonon production can be caused by an external scattering agent , for example , standard model neutrinos . in this respect ,",
    "weak probes such as cosmological neutrinos with densities @xmath28 @xmath29 per flavor have been shown to provide small phonon production rates in a crystal target @xcite . due to the tiny mass of the neutrino ,",
    "the experimental signature of this effect seems however hard to confirm .",
    "the main interest in the astrophysical context we discuss in this contribution follows as phonon excitation in a periodic system , such as the outer crust of a ns , can affect the thermal transport coefficients in the star .",
    "the potential modification of transport properties of heat / energy in the external layers in nss is crucial to possibly identifying relevant distortions in the cooling behavior of these astrophysical objects in rich ldm environments .",
    "the structure of this contribution is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the effective field theory lagrangian model using dark matter - nucleon contact interactions via scalar and vector couplings in a relativistic framework and compute the single phonon excitation rate , discussing sources of uncertainty . later , in section iii",
    "we compute the thermal conductivity in the outer crust with ldm contributions comparing the results to the standard thermal value and discussing possible astrophysical consequences . finally , in section iv we give our conclusions .",
    "in this work , we consider the interaction of an incoming fermionic dm particle , @xmath30 , scattering quasi - elastically with a nucleus in the outer ns crust lattice via scalar and vector couplings @xcite composed of @xmath31 protons @xmath32 and @xmath33 neutrons @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 are the effective scalar ( vector ) couplings of the dm particle to the nucleon ( @xmath38 ) field .",
    "we will focus on a weakly interacting candidate ( wimp ) with mass in the sub - gev range .",
    "this interaction is equivalent to considering a fermi four - fermion interaction model , where the effective couplings of mass dimension @xmath39 for these operators are obtained by integrating out the propagator of a generic @xmath40 mediator with mass @xmath41 .",
    "let us mention that , indeed , more effective operators for dirac ldm candidates are possible , see for example , table i in @xcite for leading coupling contributions to standard model fermions .",
    "however , in order to keep our description concise for the sake of clarity , we will restrict here to the spin - independent interaction model used in previous works @xcite .",
    "motivated by the need to compare bounds from colliders to direct detection , we describe interactions of dm with quarks @xmath42 and averaging in terms of nucleon fields we can write for the vector case @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is the suppression mass scale for the vector ( scalar ) case , assuming the effective couplings are of order @xmath47 and can be absorbed into @xmath48 @xcite . using bounds from cms and atlas",

    "momentum transfer is denoted by @xmath55 .",
    "generically , given an interaction potential @xmath56 felt by an interacting dm particle when approaching a nucleus in the periodic lattice , the single phonon excitation rate _",
    "per mode _ can be obtained using the fermi golden rule , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the initial and final states considered and @xmath60 assures energy conservation .",
    "given the fact that incoming ( outgoing ) ldm particles suffer a very moderate perturbation from the plane wave state , we will describe its incoming ( outgoing ) quantum state as @xmath61 with @xmath62 the volume of the system .",
    "the interaction potential felt by the ldm particle is the sum @xcite over lattice sites @xmath63 that we describe for the sake of simplicity as impenetrable point - like spheres @xmath64 . we , nevertheless , comment on corrections to this picture later in the manuscript .    using the born approximation ,",
    "the scattering amplitude for an incident @xmath30 particle can be written as @xmath65 and from its squared value , the differential cross section in the center of mass frame , @xmath66 .",
    "the validity of the born approximation is provided by the finite - range potential @xmath67 so the condition @xmath68 is fulfilled , being @xmath69 a typical target size .",
    "the effective interaction potential can be obtained from the squared interaction matrix element as calculated from the lagrangian in eq.([int_l ] ) as @xmath70 .",

    "the mandelstam variable @xmath89 can be approximated as @xmath90 , neglecting the mildly relativistic nuclei momenta .",
    "thus we can express the cross - section in the center of mass frame as @xmath91 from a zero - order momentum expansion , we recover the usual expression for direct detection spin independent cross - section at low energies @xcite for each coupling @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the reduced @xmath94 mass .",
    "note at this point that the @xmath95 enhancement in the obtained cross - section remains as the coherence condition @xmath96 is fulfilled , being @xmath97 the nuclear radius and @xmath98 the de broglie wavelength .",
    "in addition , the contribution of the nuclear lattice will be described by the summations extended over the lattice sites or , equivalently , by the inclusion of the structure factor @xmath99 , in the full phonon excitation rate expression as will be shown later in the manuscript .",
    "some studies have included form factors @xmath100 to correct a point - like nucleus nature approach @xcite , however since we will be focusing on @xmath101 limit we will consider them as unity for the sake of simplicity . in what follows",
    "we will refer to @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the single - phonon excitation time rate from the ground state now reads @xmath104 where @xmath105 with @xmath106 the lattice point and @xmath107 the displacement vector @xcite .",
    "we must note at this point that the previous expression includes the squared modulus of the fourier transform of the periodically arranged lattice sites including thus the usual description in terms of the structure factors @xmath108 .",
    "this function provides information on the spatial distribution through a correlation function and presents maxima at the crystal nuclear positions .",
    "the contribution of this factor to the global cross - section describes coherent scattering from all of the different nuclei as discussed in @xcite .",
    "there , the effect of efficient low - energy scattered wimps from the interior of the stelar dm distribution was mentioned as an additional factor to prevent dm escaping from the ns once inside . in this way it thus constitutes a mechanism for _ trapping _ dm , besides the deep gravitational potential felt by these sub - gev mass particles .    beyond this point",
    ", we will consider an isotropic medium and since the born approximation @xmath109 holds , it is most likely that acoustic modes are excited .",
    "it follows that @xmath110 where we have used the continuum limit @xmath111 and the fact that all @xmath16 have a polarization vector that verifies @xmath112 and the other two vectors are perpendicular to @xmath16 .",
    "finally eq . can be written as @xmath113 at this point we must consider the peculiarities of the incoming ldm phase space distribution @xmath114 as it will impact the averaged final phonon excitation rate .",
    "typically , for the sun or the earth the uncertainties have different sources including orbital speed of the sun , escape velocity from the dm halo and the form of the phase space distribution itself . about the latter and in local searches , direct and indirect detection",
    "are affected in different manner .",
    "for example , direct detection is sensitive to dm with high velocities @xcite while for indirect detection the low - velocity part of the distribution is tested @xcite .",
    "a popular choice is obtained using an approximation based on an isotropic sphere with density profile @xmath115 of collisionless particles , i.e. a maxwell - boltzmann type with a local mass density @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath29 .",
    "uncertainties on the knowledge of the distribution function must be carefully considered as this impacts accuracy when translating event rates to constraints on particle physics models of dm .    in the case",
    "we analyse here of a more compact object , it is the high velocity part of the distribution that is tested , as typical values for boosted root - mean - squared velocities are @xmath118 . for these relativistic regimes one must use the maxwell - jttner distribution @xcite function and , more properly ,",
    "take into account the space time curvature due to gravitational field created by the ns @xcite @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the modified bessel function of second kind defined as @xmath122 .",
    "the isotropic schwarzschild metric for the gravitational field created by the ns source is @xcite @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",

    "the distortion from the flat space with a minkowski metric efectively sets @xmath128 as expected .",
    "furthermore , if we obtain from the above the root - mean - squared @xmath129 this implies @xmath130 @xcite .",

    "@xmath135 is the dm number density near the ns .",
    "note that at non - relativistic velocities and flat space we do recover the maxwell - boltzmann distribution as expected .",
    "further , we consider all outgoing @xmath30 states are allowed as the net number will be tiny as compared to ordinary matter .",
    "the phonon excitation time rate must be weighted with the momenta of the _ local _ @xmath30 phase space that , as mentioned , is shifted to the relativistic values @xmath136 computing the zeros of the delta function and expressing the incoming momentum as @xmath137 we obtain an interval of kinematically allowed @xmath138 values @xmath139 and the eq . takes the form ,    @xmath140    in fig.([fig1 ] ) we show the single phonon excitation rate ( per unit volume ) from the ground state and averaged over @xmath30 phase space as a function of density in the outer crust using the single - nucleus table from @xcite .",

    "note , however , that in this later case , there is a strong momentum dependence that declines rapidly .",
    "we can fit this behavior for @xmath147 ev as @xmath148 and for @xmath149 ev as @xmath150 .",
    "we have verified that since , typically , the speed of the thermalized ldm particles far from the star is essentially @xmath151 , when hitting the ns it has already acquired a boosted energy . using an estimate based on a monochromatic value @xmath152 , @xmath153 we can straightforwardly integrate and obtain the analytical result @xmath154 that under - predicts the exact result by @xmath155 . as deduced from the previous expression eq.([ro ] ) the rate is indeed constant as a function of momentum as the inequality @xmath156 is fulfilled .",

    "it is already known that typically for @xmath167 , or below melting temperature @xmath168 , single - ion systems crystallize @xcite .",
    "there are a number of processes that can affect thermal conductivity in the medium .",
    "the so - called u - processes @xcite are responsible for modifying the electron conductivity such that for high temperatures , @xmath169 , electrons move almost freely . assuming a bcc lattice , @xmath170 .",

    "typically the thermal conductivity is related to the thermal phonon number at temperature @xmath18 , @xmath176 where @xmath177 . the contribution from dm can be obtained by the net number of phonons that results from the competition of thermal and scattering excitation and stimulated emission @xcite in a 4-volume @xmath178 using the averaged rate per unit volume and weighting with the incoming distribution providing the frequencies of different values of momenta we obtain    @xmath179    where @xmath180 is the @xmath30 kinetic energy and @xmath181 is the single phonon excitation rate for each particular momentum value ( not averaged over incoming @xmath30 momenta ) . since the source ( ns ) is in relative motion to the ldm flux , there is a doppler shift characterized by the source velocity @xmath182 i.e galactic ns drift velocity .",

    "we see that at the largest ldm local densities considered , there is a clear enhancement over the thermal result well inside the outer crust .",

    ", there is a negligible change though . at lower @xmath18 ,",
    "the effect of a perturbation over the thermal phonon population is more important .",
    "enhanced ( decreased ) conductivities at moderate ldm densities are due to a net reduction ( increase ) of the number of phonons in the lattice as a result of cancellation of modes . as a representative scenario ,",
    "we have taken @xmath194 at each density since we have verified that this choice verifies the kinematical restrictions on @xmath138 when performing the averages over phase space distribution as discussed in section ii .",
    "besides , rates are mostly constant at low @xmath138 . note that in standard calculations @xcite , there is no momentum dependence as they replace the frequency mode @xmath195 by a constant threshold .",
    "we must bear in mind that this result must be compiled with a realistic impurity fraction so that conductivity remains finite .",

    "since the global conductivity is @xmath204 , the obtained result is expected to contribute to the reduction of the difference in heat conduction in both directions and thus to the isotropization of the ns surface temperature pattern as seen in @xcite for standard physics .",
    "temperatures would be smoothly driven towards more isothermal profiles for latitudes among pole and equator .",
    "it is already known @xcite that the outer crust plays an important role in regulating the relation among temperature in the base of it and the surface .",
    "the detailed calculation of this implication for surface temperatures remains , however , for future work .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived for the first time the single phonon excitation rate in the outer ns crust for relativistic ldm particles in the sub - gev mass range .",
    "we have found that this rate is constant with the phonon momentum and much larger than for cosmological neutrinos at finite @xmath138 . a non - negligible correction to the local phonon excitation rate of @xmath155",

    ", we have calculated the ion thermal conductivity in the dense and hot outer envelope founding that it can be largely enhanced at ldm densities in the maximum of the ns galactic distribution @xmath205 due to a net modification of the acoustic phonon population .",
    "this effect is non negligible at densities beyond @xmath206 @xmath13 in the base of the outer crust at the level of standard ion - electron or thermal effects @xcite .",
    "we do not expect the degenerate electron contribution to largely modify this result as this would mildly screen nuclear charge in the lattice however it remains to be further studied .",
    "although a detailed study of the quantitative effect in the surface temperature pattern remains to be undertaken , it is expected that for magnetized nss the ldm - enhanced global enhancement of the perpendicular thermal conductivity allows a reduction of the difference of heat transport among parallel and perpendicular directions to the magnetid field . based on previous works only including standard thermal contributions we expect",
