    "the existence and properties of solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) has been the subject of considerable interest over the recent decade ( for a review see articles @xcite and books @xcite ) .",
    "all of the main types of matter - wave solitons , such as dark @xcite , bright @xcite , and gap @xcite , have been observed in the experiments .",
    "dark solitons emerge in a bec with repulsive interactions between atoms ( nonlinearity is defocusing ) , while for the existence of bright solitons the interatomic interaction has to be attractive ( nonlinearity is focusing ) .",
    "gap solitons develop in repulsive condensates loaded in periodic potential of the optical lattice . while in homogeneous condensates solitons",
    "exist due to the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion , in a repulsive bec subject to a periodic potential of the optical lattice , gap solitons come out of the interplay between nonlinearity and periodicity of the medium .    nowadays the conditions for the existence of these main types of solitons are usually created in magnetic and optical traps for cold quantum gases  @xcite .",
    "meantime , the experimental techniques for trapping and manipulation of bec s are progressing and novel conditions for the localized matter - waves are emerging . in this regard , development of atom chips for bec s @xcite and further advances in feshbach resonance management of atomic interactions @xcite can be mentioned as two important examples .",
    "specifically , the atom chip technology combined with techniques to suppress three - body recombination @xcite allows to produce long - lived condensates with increased density , where the contribution of three - body scattering is dominant . on the other hand , even in condensates with normal density , inhibition of the two - body s - wave scattering length by a feshbach resonance technique gives rise to enhanced role of the three - body effects . in these conditions the governing mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the dynamics of bec includes higher order nonlinear terms , alongside with the usual cubic term . as a consequence ,",
    "localized matter - waves exhibit novel features both in their shape and dynamic behavior , compared to matter - wave solitons of the conventional gpe .    in this work",
    "we focus on a specific class of bright solitons , so called  flat - top \" solitons , which remain less explored in the context of bec .",
    "flat - top solitons in bec s emerge when the repulsion between atoms , originating from three - atom collisions , prevails the attraction resulting from two - atom interactions . in terms of the governing gpe",
    ", this implies that the defocusing quintic nonlinearity is stronger than the focusing cubic nonlinearity . in the experiments such a situation is realized when the density of the condensate is high , for instance in bec s on atom chips , or when the usual two - body interactions are suppressed by means of a feshbach resonance technique .",
    "the properties bec described by gpe with cubic - quintic nonlinearity and generic trap potential can be explored using the lagrangian formalism .",
    "our objective is the development of a lagrangian based variational approximation ( va ) for flat - top solitons using the super - gaussian trial function .",
    "static version of the va provides stationary shape of the soliton , while the time - dependent version can be used for studying small amplitude oscillations around stationary states .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate the model and present the governing equations . in sections iii and iv , respectively , the static and dynamic versions of the va have been developed . in concluding section v we formulate our main findings",
    "the dynamics of a quasi-1d bose - einstein condensate with two- and three - body interactions , confined to an external trap potential , is described by the following gross - pitaevskii equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the mean - field wave function of the condensate , @xmath2 is the atomic mass , @xmath3 is the coefficient of cubic nonlinearity with @xmath4 being the atomic s - wave scattering length , characterizing the strength of two - body interactions , @xmath5 is the coefficient of quintic nonlinearity responsible for three - body interactions , @xmath6 is the transverse harmonic oscillator length , @xmath7 is the number of atoms comprising the bec , and @xmath8 is the harmonic trap potential in the axial direction .",
    "strengths of the trap potential in the axial and radial directions are given , respectively , through the trap frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in deriving the eq .",
    "( [ gpe0 ] ) from the original 3d gpe it is assumed that the transverse confinement of the condensate is strong enough , so that its radial degrees of freedom are fixed . in this condition characteristic energies of the transverse excitations @xmath11 are much greater than the energy from the nonlinear term @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are the atomic @xmath14-wave scattering length , peak density of the condensate and the atomic mass , respectively .",
    "therefore , the dynamic evolution of the condensate is possible only in the axial direction , while in the radial direction it remains in the ground state of the strong parabolic trap ( transverse dynamics is frozen ) .",
    "alternatively , the criterion for the one - dimensionality of bec can be expressed as @xmath15 , which can be understood as the radial harmonic oscillator length being much greater than the healing length ( for @xmath16rb : @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the wave function is subject to the normalization condition , @xmath22 for convenience we reduce the eq .",
    "( [ gpe0 ] ) into dimensionless form by adopting new variables @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , + @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) . according to data of @xcite for @xmath16rb condensate @xmath31  @xmath32/s , @xmath33  @xmath34/s , i.e. both nonlinear terms in eq .",
    "( [ gpe0 ] ) are positive ( repulsive ) . however , in our case for the existence of self - trapped localized matter - waves we assume that the coefficient of cubic nonlinearity @xmath35 is shifted to negative ( attractive ) domain via change of the s - wave scattering length @xmath4 by a feshbach resonance technique . the strength of transverse confinement used in matter - wave soliton experiments  @xcite @xmath36 provides @xmath37 m .",
    "then , for the number of atoms in @xmath16  rb bec @xmath38 we get the following values for the dimensionless coefficients of cubic and quintic nonlinear terms @xmath39 , @xmath40 . in subsequent numerical simulations",
    "we employ the above estimates for the coefficients .",
    "exact one soliton solutions of eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) in the absence of external potential ( @xmath41 ) were found in ref .",
    "for the case of self - focusing cubic ( @xmath42 ) and defocusing quintic ( @xmath43 ) nonlinearities , under normalization condition ( [ norm1 ] ) , the solution is @xmath44}{\\sqrt{1 + \\mathrm{sech}(\\eta ) \\mathrm{cosh}(x / a ) } } , \\quad \\eta \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\beta}{3 } } , \\quad a \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\frac{\\eta}{\\mathrm{tanh}(\\eta ) } , \\label{exact1}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 stand for the wave vector and chemical potential . in presence of a trap potential the eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) does not have analytic solution , and therefore one has to recourse to approximate methods .",
    "it is appropriate to mention , that cubic - quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ gpe1 ] ) with flat - top solutions appears in a variety of physical contexts in nonlinear optics @xcite , fluid dynamics @xcite , plasma physics @xcite and bec  @xcite .",
    "recently it was considered as a model equation describing bright solitons in the tonks - girargeau gas with dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the variational approach developed in this paper is of general interest for the above mentioned fields .",
    "the variational approximation represents one of the important theoretical tools for investigation of solitons in non - integrable models @xcite .",
    "the success of va essentially depends on the proper choice of a trial function .",
    "in particular , significant progress has been made with application of va to nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) type equations with cubic nonlinearity , employing gaussian and hyperbolic secant trial functions . however ,",
    "when the higher order nonlinear terms are included in the nls equation , the shapes of localized states may significantly deviate from the above mentioned functions , and one has to consider other options .",
    "the possibility to perform analytic calculations is the major issue in selection of a trial function .    for the nls with competing cubic and quintic nonlinearities ,",
    "when the soliton features a flat - top shape , a super - gaussian  @xcite and super - secant  @xcite trial functions were shown to be appropriate for the description of self - trapping of laser beams in two - dimensional ( 2d ) cubic - quintic nonlinear media .",
    "the behavior of soliton solution of the nls equation with arbitrary nonlinearity near the blow - up point was investigated in @xcite by means of va based on a super - gaussian trial function , and accurate estimate for the critical blow - up mass was found . among other successful applications of the super - gaussian trial function , description of the pulsating localized solutions of the cubic - quintic complex ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite and stationary solutions to the nls equation in a parabolic - index fiber  @xcite , can be mentioned .    although the eq . ( [ gpe1 ] ) without external potential ( @xmath47 ) has exact one soliton solution ( [ exact1 ] ) , in ref .",
    "a variational approximation using the gaussian trial function was developed for this case .",
    "justification for the construction of va when the exact soliton solution is available , can be found in some advantages provided by the va in the analysis of existence and stability of solitons .",
    "for instance , when both of the nonlinear terms in eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) are focusing , the localized wave undergoes collapse ( unlimited shrinking ) if the norm of the wave function exceeds some critical value . the va with a gaussian trial function accurately predicts the corresponding threshold norm ( the solution ceases to exist at this value of the norm ) @xcite . furthermore , simple analytic relations between parameters of the localized state provided by va facilitates its stability analysis by means of the vakhitov - kolokolov criterion @xcite .",
    "however , the gaussian trial function restricts the validity of the developed va to specific areas of the parameter space of eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) , since it is adequate only if both nonlinear terms are focusing , or when the effect of repulsive quintic term is weak compared to the attractive cubic one . in the opposite situation the localized solution acquires a flat - top shape , and one has to consider a different trial function . with this motivation in mind below we develop the va for eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) using a super - gaussian trial function , and apply it for the analysis of static and dynamic properties of flat - top matter - wave solitons .",
    "it is instructive to start with considering the variational solution of eq .",
    "( [ gpe1 ] ) in a free space and comparing the obtained wave profile with the available exact one soliton solution ( [ exact1 ] ) .",
    "the aim here is twofold .",
    "form one side we can thereby check the accuracy of the va , and from the other side , useful relations between soliton parameters will be obtained .    in absence of external trap potential",
    "the governing equation has the following form @xmath48 can be rescaled to one by transformations @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we retain it for convenience of the time dependent va to be considered later .",
    "the stationary states , which are looked for as @xmath51 , satisfy the following equation @xmath52 the lagrangian density generating this equation is @xmath53    since the typical localized solutions of eq .",

    "the averaged lagrangian @xmath56 computed with this ansatz is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gamma function , and the notation @xmath59 is introduced .",
