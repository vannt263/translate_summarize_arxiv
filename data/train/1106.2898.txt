    "the advent of the @xmath2 x - ray observatory , with its unprecedented sub - arcsecond resolution , allowed to study better than ever before the main contributors to the total x - ray emission of early - type galaxies ( hereafter etgs ) : the low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; fabbiano 2006 ) , a population of weak sources as late type stellar coronae , cataclismic variables , and coronally active binaries ( pellegrini & fabbiano 1994 , revnivtsev et al .",
    "2008 ) , the nuclear emission due to a supermassive black hole ( mbh ; e.g. , gallo et al . 2010 , pellegrini 2010 ) , and a hot interstellar medium ( ism ) with a temperature of a few million degrees .",
    "after careful subtraction of the stellar ( resolved and unresolved ) and nuclear emissions , the properties of the hot ism could be characterized with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "recently , this has been done for a sample of 30 normal ( non - cd ) etgs observed with @xmath2 to a depth ensuring the detection of bright lmxbs ( boroson et al .",
    "2011 , hereafter bkf ) .",
    "this is the first x - ray sample of etgs covering a wide range of galactic luminosity , central velocity dispersion @xmath3 , and hot gas emission @xmath1 , and with the x - ray properties of the hot gas ( e.g. , luminosity @xmath1 and average temperature @xmath0 ) derived in a homogeneous way , using a complete and accurate procedure to subtract all kinds of non - gaseous emission ( nucleus , detected and undetected lmxbs , and unresolved weak stellar sources ) .",
    "this approach resulted in a larger fraction of hot gas - poor galaxies than in previous samples , with @xmath1 extending down to much lower values than before ( @xmath12 erg s@xmath5 ) , and showing a variation of up to @xmath13 orders of magnitude at the same galactic luminosity ( see also david et al .",
    "2006 , diehl & statler 2007 , memola et al .",
    "such a wide variation , even larger than previously found , had been linked to the origin and evolution of the hot ism , and had provided evidence for the effectiveness of an internal heating mechanism ( as from type ia supernovae , hereafter snia s ) to regulate the gas evolution and produce its very different content in etgs at the present epoch ( loewenstein & mathews 1987 , david et al .",
    "1990 , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) ; the action of external agents ( gas stripping , confinement , accretion ) to reduce or enhance the gas content was also invoked ( e.g. , white & sarazin 1991 , brown & bregman 2000 , sun et al .",
    "2007 ) .    with this new characterization of the hot gas",
    ", bkf revisited the relationships between fundamental properties of the hot gas and of the host galaxy , as the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 relations , where @xmath3 is a representative measure of the depth of the galactic potential well ( eskridge et al .",

    "@xmath1 correlates positively with @xmath0 and @xmath3 , though with a wide variation at fixed @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the best fit relation @xmath17 , close to what already known for x - ray luminous etgs ( osullivan et al .",
    "2003 ) , is still moderately strong among etgs with low @xmath0 and @xmath1 ; also , in the @xmath15 relation , etgs with @xmath18 kev are the x - ray brightest ( with one exception ) , while those with @xmath19 kev are the x - ray faintest .",
    "the least gas rich etgs are then the coolest ones , which seemed contrary to expectation , if low @xmath1 etgs loose their ism in an outflow ( e.g. , david et al .",
    "1990 , ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) , and the hotter the gas , the stronger is the outflow ( bkf ) . on average",
    "@xmath0 increases with @xmath3 , and most etgs lie above a rough estimate of the gas virial temperature ( @xmath20 ) , suggesting the presence of additional heating .",
    "etgs with a moderate to high gas content ( @xmath21 erg s@xmath5 ) follow a trend roughly parallel to that of @xmath22 ; instead , etgs with little hot gas ( @xmath23 erg s@xmath5 ) have a similar temperature for @xmath3 ranging from 160 to 250 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this lack of correlation was attributed to a different dynamical state of the hot ism in gas - poor with respect to gas - rich etgs , though a full explanation of this aspect remained to be found ( bkf ) .",
    "this work takes advantage of the new accurate measurements of the hot gas properties , and of the fundamental relations @xmath15 and @xmath16 , derived down to galaxy masses and x - ray luminosities smaller than ever before ( bkf ) , to investigate the relationship between @xmath0 , the galaxy structure , the internal gas heating mechanisms ( snia s , and those linked to the gravitational potential ) , and the dynamical status of the gas flow . to this purpose ,",
    "a few characteristic temperatures are introduced , depending on the nature of the gas heating sources and the galaxy structure , and relevant for the various gas flow phases ; these characteristic temperatures are then compared with the observed @xmath0 values . in doing so , galaxy mass models are built according to the most recent understanding of the etgs structure , such as their stellar mass profile and their dark matter content and distribution , as indicated by detailed modeling of optical observations and by the main scaling laws ( e.g. , cappellari et al . 2006 , weijmans et al .",

    "in etgs the hot gas comes from stellar mass losses produced by evolved stars , mainly during the red giant , asymptotic giant branch , and planetary nebula phases , and by snia s , that are the only ones observed in an old stellar population ( e.g. , cappellaro et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the first , more quiescent , type of losses originates ejecta that initially have the velocity of the parent star , then individually interact with the mass lost from other stars or with the hot ism , and mix with it ( mathews 1990 , parriott & bregman 2008 ) .    for a galaxy of total stellar mass @xmath24",
    ", the evolution of the stellar mass loss rate @xmath25 can be calculated using single burst stellar population synthesis models ( maraston 2005 ) , for a salpeter and for a kroupa initial mass function ( imf ) , assuming for example solar abundance .",
    "so doing , at an age of 12 gyrs , a rate is recovered of @xmath26= b @xmath27yr@xmath5 , where @xmath28 is the galactic b - band luminosity at an age of 12 gyr , and b=1.8 or b=1.9 for the salpeter or kroupa imf ( see also pellegrini 2011 ) .",
    "this value is in reasonable agreement with the average derived for nine local etgs from @xmath29 data ( athey et al .",
    "2002 ) of @xmath30 m@xmath31yr@xmath5 , an estimate based on individual observed values that vary by a factor of @xmath32 , though , which was attributed to different ages and metallicities .",
    "the total mass loss rate of a stellar population @xmath33 is given by the sum @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the rate of mass loss via snia events for the whole galaxy .",
    "@xmath36 is given by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the ejected mass by one event , and @xmath39 is the explosion rate .",
    "@xmath40 has been determined for local etgs to be @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the hubble constant in units of km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( cappellaro et al . 1999 ) .",
    "more recent measurements of the observed rates of supernovae in the local universe ( li et al .",
    "2010 ) give a snia s rate in etgs consistent with that of cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . for @xmath43 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , one obtains @xmath44 = 2.2@xmath45 m@xmath31 yr@xmath5",
    ", that is @xmath46 times smaller than @xmath26 derived above for an age of 12 gyr ; therefore , the main source of mass for the hot gas is provided by @xmath47 .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that the gas is shed by stars with a radial dependence that follows that of the stellar distribution , so that the density profile of the injected gas is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the stellar density profile .",
    "this assumption is adopted hereafter , and the characteristic temperatures presented below apply to a gas distribution following @xmath48 ( but see also sect .  [ disc ] ) .",
    "the material lost by stars is ejected at a velocity of few tens of km s@xmath5 and at a temperature of @xmath50 k ( parriott & bregman 2008 ) , and is subsequently heated to high , x - ray emitting temperatures by the thermalization of the stellar velocity dispersion , as it collides with the mass lost from other stars , or with the ambient hot gas , and is shocked .",
    "another source of heating for the stellar mass losses is provided by the thermalization of the kinetic energy of snia s events . the internal energy given by these heating processes to the unit mass of injected gas is @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 the boltzmann constant , @xmath53 the proton mass , @xmath54 the mean particle mass , with @xmath55 for solar abundance ) ; @xmath56 is determined by the heating due to thermalization of the motions of the gas - losing stars ( @xmath57 ) , and of the velocity of the snia s ejecta ( @xmath58 ) , and is written as ( e.g. , gisler 1976 , white & chevalier 1983 ) : @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the equivalent temperature of the stellar motions ( see below ) , and @xmath61 is the equivalent temperature of the kinetic energy @xmath62 of the snia s ejecta , with @xmath63 erg for one event",

    "[ loss ] for @xmath71 and @xmath47 ( for a kroupa imf ) at the present epoch , one obtains @xmath72 k.    the injection temperature @xmath56 is then the sum of two parts : one ( @xmath58 ) is independent of the position within the galaxy where the gas is injected ( e.g. , independent of radius in spherical symmetry ) , and is also constant from galaxy to galaxy ( for fixed imf and age of the stellar population , and snia s rate ) ; for each etg it can , though , evolve with time , if @xmath71 and @xmath47 evolve differently with time ( ciotti et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the other part ( @xmath57 ) is instead basically independent of time , but has a radial dependence , and changes with the galaxy structure , i.e. , with the total mass and its distribution .",

    "[ disc ] below .      in case of mass losses flowing to the galactic center",
    ", the gas can be heated due to infall in the galactic potential and adiabatic compression ; this process is sometimes referred to as `` gravitational heating '' . the average change in gravitational energy per unit gas mass inflowing through the galactic potential down to the galactic center is @xmath91 dr , \\label{eq : lgp}\\ ] ] for galaxy mass distributions with a finite value of @xmath92 ( see also ciotti et al .",
    "one can define a temperature equivalent to the energy in eq .",

    ", also @xmath94 is @xmath95 , and increases for larger @xmath96 and smaller @xmath86 , which , for inflowing gas , can be understood as a larger gas heating by compression during infall for a larger dark matter amount or its higher concentration .",
    "not all of @xmath97 can be available for heating , though .",
    "if the inflow keeps quasi - hydrostatic , then , by the virial theorem , the energy radiated away is roughly one - half of the change in the gravitational potential energy , and that available for the heating of the gas is the remaining half for a self - gravitating gas ; for gas in an external potential , the result should remain roughly valid ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . ] ( i.e. , @xmath98 ) .",
    "actually , the energy available for heating will be much less than this .",
    "inflows are caused by the radiative losses produced by the accumulation of the stellar mass return , that makes the cooling time lower than the galactic age ; in the central regions , within a radius of @xmath99 kpc , the cooling time can be as short as @xmath100 yr , even shorter than the infall time ( e.g. , sarazin & white 1988 , pellegrini 2011 ) . in these conditions ,",
    "the gas departs from a slow inflow , becomes very dense and supersonic close to the center , and cools rapidly down to low temperatures , so that @xmath101 is radiated away or goes into kinetic energy of condensations ( sarazin & ashe 1989 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is the possibility that not all the gas reaches hot the galactic central region , if thermal instabilities develop and produce drop - outs from the flow ; if gas cools and condenses out of the flow at large radii , then @xmath97 can be much lower than in the definition above , and heating due to infall in the gravitational potential is `` lost '' ( sarazin & ashe 1989 ) . in conclusion , without a precise knowledge of how to compute @xmath102 ( which depends on the radius at which the injected gas drops below x - ray emitting temperatures ) , and about what fraction of @xmath102 is radiated or goes into kinetic energy of the condensations , @xmath103 remains a reference value ; a more direct use can instead be made of the analogous temperature for escape @xmath104 introduced in sect .",
    "[ esc ] below .      due to the presence of a central mbh in etgs , another potential source of heating for the gas",
    "could be provided by nuclear accretion .",
    "this subject has been studied intensely recently , through both observations and modeling , and it appears that the energy provided by accretion is of the order of that needed to offset cyclically the cooling of the inflowing gas in the central regions of gas - rich etgs ( e.g. , brzan et al . 2004 , million et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , the central mbh is believed to be a heat source that balances the radiative losses of the gas , acting mostly in the central cooling region . in gas",
    "poor etgs the nuclear accretion energy is far lower due to the very small mass accretion rate , if present ( pellegrini et al .",
    "2007 ) , and the absorption of the energy output from accretion is likely not efficient . given the role of the mbh outlined above , possible energy input from the mbh will not be considered as a source of global heating for the gas .",
    "another characteristic temperature for comparison with observed @xmath0 values is the temperature with which the gas can escape from the galaxy . assuming that the flow is stationary and adiabatic , the bernoulli constant on each streamline along which the gas flows out of the galaxy must be positive .",
    "the bernoulli equation with the minimum energy for escape is written as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the enthalpy per unit gas mass , @xmath107 is the ratio of specific heats , @xmath108 is the sound velocity , and @xmath109 is the flow velocity . integrating over the galaxy volume and gas - mass averaging , this condition becomes : @xmath110 where the escape energy @xmath111 is the average energy required to remove from the galaxy the unit gas mass .",
    "@xmath112 gives a minimum energy requirement , since energy losses due to cooling may be present ; but these are not important for outflows that typically have a low density ( e.g. , sect .  [ sna ] below ) .",
    "the escape temperature equivalent to @xmath113 is @xmath114 .",
    "the condition for the minimum energy for escape can then be translated into a condition for the injection temperature of the gas @xmath115 to be larger than @xmath116 . in the simple case that @xmath117 is due only to one ( stellar ) mass component , from @xmath118 and the virial theorem ( sect .",

    "[ eq : lm ] and then of @xmath116 will be calculated below for a general mass model ( e.g. , made by the superposition of stars and dark matter , with a different radial distribution ) . in previous works ,",
    "the sufficient condition for the existence of a galactic wind was that the injection temperature exceeded an `` escape temperature '' , defined as @xmath120 ( white & chevalier 1983 ) , or `` twice the equivalent dark halo temperature '' ( loewenstein & mathews 1987 ) , coupled with the request for the radiative cooling time in the central part of the galaxy to be longer than the time required to flow out of this region .",
    "these conditions are similar to imposing that @xmath115 exceeds @xmath121 as derived above .    in principle",
    "the gas can escape with different combinations of @xmath109 and @xmath0 , and the observed @xmath0 should be close . ] to that entering @xmath122 in eq .",
    "[ eq : bern ] .",
    "there are two extreme cases for the value of the flow velocity @xmath109 with respect to @xmath108 ( i.e. , to the temperature ) .",
    "one is when the material is brought to infinity keeping a subsonic velocity , then the minimum energy requirement becomes @xmath123 ; neglecting the kinetic term in eq .",
    "[ eq : bern ] , one then obtains a characteristic gas - mass averaged subsonic escape temperature : @xmath124 in a general case , @xmath123 gives for @xmath0 a larger requirement than obtained when @xmath109 is not neglected ; also the partition of the gas energy between enthalpy and kinetic energy can vary with radius within a galaxy .",
    "all this means that @xmath125 represents a fiducial upper limit to the observed temperatures of outflowing gas : if the kinetic energy of the flow is important , then the actual gas temperature will be lower ( the stronger the outflow , with respect to @xmath108 , the cooler the gas ) . at the opposite extreme case where the `` temperature '' contribution to the gas energy is minor and that of the velocity is dominant , the bernoulli equation reduces to @xmath126 ; this gives the usual escape velocity of a unit mass from a potential well : @xmath127 .",
    "finally , @xmath116 and @xmath125 have the same dependence as @xmath74 on @xmath128 . for the representative galaxy mass models used here ( sect .",

    "when a direct comparison is made with observed @xmath0 s , it must be noted that the latter coincide with mass - weighted averages only if the ism has everywhere one single temperature value ; if the gas is multi - phase , or its temperature profile has a gradient , a single @xmath0 value measured from the spectrum of the integrated emission will be close to an emission - weighted average ( e.g. , ciotti & pellegrini 2008 , kim 2011 ) .",
