    "the nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron can be almost completely ascribed to the @xmath1 process ( `` slow neutron capture process '' ) and the @xmath15 process ( `` rapid neutron capture process '' ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 process can be further divided into a `` weak '' component ( responsible for nuclei up to @xmath2@xmath390 ) and a `` main '' component ( for 90@xmath8@xmath2@xmath8209 ) , which occur in different astrophysical scenarios at different temperatures and with different neutron exposures .",
    "the weak @xmath1-process occurs during core he and shell c burning in massive stars . among the nuclei involved , the long - lived isotopes @xmath4ni ( t@xmath16= 100 yr ) , @xmath17se ( t@xmath16 @xmath3480000 yr ) , and @xmath18kr ( t@xmath16= 10.76 yr ) assume key positions , because their stellar @xmath19@xmath20-decay rate becomes comparable to the neutron capture rate ( @xmath21@xmath3@xmath22 ) .",
    "the resulting competition leads to branchings in the @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis path ( see fig .  [ branch ] ) .",
    "process at @xmath4ni . ]    in the case of @xmath4ni the split of the reaction path causes part of the reaction flow to bypass @xmath13zn , whereas at @xmath23zn both flows merge back .",
    "the reaction flow to the higher mass region depends not only on the abundances of the seed nuclei but on their stellar neutron capture cross sections as well .",
    "generally , the ( resonant capture part of the ) cross section can be determined directly by measuring the prompt @xmath24-rays associated with neutron capture events in time - of - flight ( tof ) experiments . a method to include",
    "also the direct capture ( dc ) component of the capture process is to measure the activity of the product nuclei - if unstable - after the irradiation , applying the so called activation method .",
    "the determination of neutron cross sections by means of the activation technique represents an important complement to measurements using the tof method since this independent approach implies different systematic uncertainties . in combination with accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ) the activation technique can be extended to hitherto inaccessible cases , e.g. to reactions producing very long - lived nuclei with very weak or completely missing @xmath24-transitions .",
    "the application of ams counting in stellar neutron reactions has the further advantage of being independent of uncertain @xmath24-ray intensities .",
    "the present activations @xcite and those by nassar et al .",
    "@xcite ( see table  [ tab : act ] ) were carried out at the ( now closed ) 3.7 mv van de graaff accelerator at forschungszentrum karlsruhe using enriched @xmath6ni samples .",
    "neutrons were produced with the @xmath25li(@xmath26)@xmath25be source by bombarding 30 @xmath27 m thick layers of metallic li on a water - cooled cu backing with protons of 1912 kev , 30 kev above the reaction threshold .",
    "the angle - integrated neutron spectrum imitates almost perfectly a maxwell - boltzmann distribution for @xmath7 = 25.0@xmath120.5  kev with a maximum neutron energy of 108  kev @xcite . at this proton energy the neutron flux is kinematically collimated in a forward cone with 120@xmath28 opening angle .",
    "neutron scattering through the cu backing is negligible since the transmission is about 98% in the energy range of interest . to ensure homogeneous illumination of the entire surface ,",
    "the proton beam with a dc current of @xmath3100  @xmath27a was wobbled across the li target .",
    "the mean neutron flux over the period of the activations was @xmath312@xmath2910@xmath30 s@xmath31 at the position of the samples , which were placed in close geometry to the li target .",
    "a @xmath32li - glass monitor at 1  m distance from the neutron target was used to record the time - dependence of the neutron yield in intervals of 1  min as the li target degrades during the irradiation . in this way the proper correction of the number of nuclei which decayed during the activation can be attained .",
    "this correction is negligible for very long half - lives but becomes important for comparably short - lived isotopes like @xmath33au , since gold is used as the reference cross section for the neutron flux determination .",
    "the @xmath4ni/@xmath6ni ratio of our two independently irradiated @xmath6ni samples @xcite was measured with the gas - filled analyzing magnet system ( gams ) at the 14  mv mp tandem accelerator in munich .",
    "the ams setup for @xmath4ni consists of a cesium sputter ion source dedicated exclusively to this isotope with an isobaric @xmath4cu background smaller by 2 orders of magnitude compared to our standard ion sources @xcite .",
    "the sample material was metallic @xmath6ni powder from different batches with enrichments of 95% and 97.3% , respectively .",
    "the samples were pressed into ultrapure graphite cathodes without further chemical processing .",
    "the nickel was extracted as ni@xmath20 from the ion source and stripped to positive charge states by a thin carbon foil ( 4 @xmath27g/@xmath34 ) at the terminal of the tandem accelerator . for our measurements we chose the 12@xmath35 and 13@xmath35 charge states and terminal voltages between 12.4 and 12.7  mv .",
    "the gams detection system consists of a 135@xmath28 gas - filled magnet and a segmented frisch - grid ionization chamber , where the anode is divided along the flight path into 5 energy loss signals @xmath36e1 to @xmath36e5 .",
    "the field of the gams magnet was adjusted to suppress the remaining @xmath4cu background as much as possible without hampering the @xmath4ni measurement .",
    "this combination allows the determination of @xmath4ni / ni ratios as low as 2@xmath2910@xmath37 , with a total isobaric suppression of several times 10@xmath30 @xcite .    the activated samples , blank samples , and standards were measured alternately several times under the same conditions ( see fig .

    "the ams measurements yielded isotope ratios of @xmath41= ( 6.0@xmath121.7)@xmath29 10@xmath43 for sample ni-62a and ( 5.1@xmath121.3)@xmath29 10@xmath43 for ni-62b ( table  [ tab : act ] ) .",
    "the experimental cross section can be directly obtained from this isotopic ratio via @xmath44= @xmath41@xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "transformation of this weighted experimental cross section @xmath44= 25.2  mb in the quasi - maxwellian neutron spectrum into a true maxwellian ( for a detailed description of the transformation , see @xcite ) yields a ( preliminary ) cross section at @xmath7=30  kev of @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11=23.4@xmath124.6  mb @xcite , in perfect agreement with the previous ams measurement from @xcite ( @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11=26.1@xmath122.6  mb ) .",
    "the counts of mass 63 from the blank sample ( see fig .",
    "[ ams ] ) correspond to an isotope ratio @xmath41=3.0@xmath2910@xmath38 .",
    "the origin of these counts is due to the cu impurity in the blank , but since the number of these background counts is much smaller than the uncertainties in the measurements we did not correct for that .",

    "[ tab : act ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for the photodisintegration measurements of @xmath13ni at the elbe accelerator at forschungszentrum dresden - rossendorf we activated 2 metallic samples of @xmath13ni ( enrichment 99.63% ) at 11.5  mev and 13.4  mev , and another sample with 89.8% enrichment at 10.3  mev . up to now",
    "only one of these samples ( @xmath49=13.4  mev ) was measured for a short time with ams @xcite . unfortunately the @xmath13ni samples with 99.63% enrichment had a factor of 10 higher @xmath4cu background than the @xmath6ni samples .",
    "the measured isotopic ratio of @xmath50=(1.1@xmath51)@xmath2910@xmath52 is governed by this large background corrections .",
    "the ( preliminary ) cross section is lower by a factor of two compared to the prediction of non - smoker @xcite . however , it has to be emphasized here , that this measurement suffered from rather large statistical uncertainties due to the @xmath4cu background .",
    "a more accurate value is expected after the measurements of all three samples are completed .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the stellar neutron capture cross sections of @xmath0ni is required since these two cross sections affect the entire weak @xmath1-process flow towards heavier nuclei . especially the @xmath6ni@xmath5@xmath4ni cross section was found to act like a bottleneck due to its previously recommended low cross section of 12.5  mb @xcite .    the first measurement of the stellar @xmath6ni@xmath5 cross section was carried out in 1975 via the time - of - flight technique ( tof ) and yielded @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11=26.8@xmath125.0  mb @xcite . depending on how the dc component was calculated , the results could change to values between 12.5  mb @xcite and 35.5  mb @xcite . the lower cross section is derived if a subthreshold resonance is subtracted at thermal energies before the dc cross section is extrapolated with @xmath1-wave behavior into the stellar kev - region .",
    "the @xmath6ni@xmath5 cross section has been measured recently with both , the tof method @xcite and with the activation method plus ams @xcite .",
    "the results from both ams measurements are in good agreement and also consistent with the recent tof measurement by @xcite .",
    "purely theoretical predictions for the @xmath6ni capture cross section at @xmath7=30  kev range between 9.7  mb and 21.2  mb , below a weighted average of 26@xmath122  mb calculated from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for the @xmath4ni@xmath5 cross section experimental data existed neither for the neutron capture channel nor the inverse photodissociation channel .",
    "our measurement of the @xmath13ni@xmath14@xmath4ni can be used to test the theoretical model predictions for this cross section and thus help to improve the predictions for the @xmath4ni@xmath5 channel .",
    "stellar model calculations @xcite showed the influence of a lower @xmath4ni@xmath5 cross section during the two phases of the weak @xmath1 process in massive stars . during core he burning ( t@xmath3300  mk ) neutron densities are so low that a change in the @xmath4ni cross section has no influence because @xmath4ni can @xmath19-decay to @xmath4cu . however , at the high neutron densities during shell c burning with temperatures of @xmath31  gk a lower cross section can strongly influence the abundances of @xmath4cu ( + 30% ) and @xmath13ni ( 20% ) .",
    "the `` stellar @xmath6ni problem '' was postulated when strong overproductions of ( @xmath53ni and ) @xmath6ni were derived from postexplosive production factors of supernova type ii explosions in stars with 15  m@xmath54 , 20  m@xmath54 , and 25  m@xmath54 @xcite .",
    "these stellar models were carried out with a maxwellian average cross section of @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11=12.5  mb and raised the question whether this overproduction is due to uncertainties in the stellar models or in the nuclear input .",
    "an increase in the cross section would lead to more destruction of @xmath6ni , but in turn to a increase of the abundances for isotopes with 63@xmath10@xmath2@xmath1090 . with the new @xmath6ni@xmath5 cross section the abundance of @xmath6ni goes down by 20% , but the abundances of all following isotopes up to the next shell - closure at @xmath55=50",
    "are increased by @xmath320% , thus relaxing the `` @xmath6ni problem '' .    on the other hand",
    "the production of @xmath6ni in massive stars could be larger than previously calculated .",
    "this possibility might be supported by a recent publication of marhas et al .",
    "@xcite , who measured the ni isotopes in sic grains with nanosims and found large excesses ( @xmath56  @xmath53ni/@xmath57ni(average)= 622@xmath58 and @xmath56  @xmath6ni/@xmath57ni(average)= 206@xmath58 ) of @xmath59ni in the so - called `` x grains '' ( which are thought to originate from the ejecta of sn type ii ) .",
    "these isotopic signatures can only be explained in stellar model calculations by mixing contributions from different zones in the sn ii .",
    "the `` stellar @xmath6ni problem '' has been solved from the nuclear physics side , and a weighted average of @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11=26@xmath122  mb from @xcite can be recommended for future stellar modeling .",
    "however , the calculated overproduction of @xmath6ni is not removed completely by this new determination of the cross section",
    ". the remaining overproduction might be due to either a really existing overproduction ( possibly supported by @xmath59ni excesses in presolar x grains ) or to problems in stellar modelling .",
    "we have also measured the @xmath13ni@xmath14 cross section for the first time , leading to the preliminary conclusion that this cross section might be smaller by a factor of two compared to non - smoker predictions .",
