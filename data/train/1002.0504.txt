    ", we announce the discovery of two further milky way satellites in the southern galactic portion of the sdss segue survey .",
    "they lie in adjacent constellations and each extend only a couple of arc - minutes on the sky . however , their heliocentric distances differ by an order of magnitude , and , hence , so do their physical sizes .",
    "we name the dwarf galaxy in the constellation of pisces , lying at the heliocentric distance of @xmath0 kpc and measuring @xmath3 pc across , pisces ii .",
    "this is the second galactic stellar halo sub - structure in pisces - the first , pisces i was announced earlier this year by  @xcite .",
    "pisces i is much closer and more dispersed on the sky : it is at least several degrees across and lies at @xmath4 kpc .",
    "our second discovery is a feeble cluster of stars in the constellation of pegasus .",
    "it has a half - light radius of 3 pc and lies at a heliocentric distance of 16 kpc .",
    "we name it segue 3 , after segue , the imaging survey in the data of which it was found .    in the analysis presented in this letter",

    "the sdss imaging data are available through the latest data release 7 ( dr7 ) in two parts : i ) @xmath31 square degrees of the main sdss field of view , mostly around the north galactic cap and ii ) @xmath32 square degrees of segue imaging at low galactic latitudes , with large portions of the southern galactic sky covered  @xcite .",
    "these imaging data are produced in five photometric bands , namely @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 and are automatically processed through the same pipelines to measure photometric and astrometric properties @xcite .",
    "the two imaging datasets differ in the continuity of the sky coverage and the amount of galactic reddening : while most of the sdss has contiguous coverage and is observed through minimal amounts of dust , segue consists of tens of long , @xmath38-wide stripes affected by various amounts of galactic extinction .    both discontinuity in coverage and variable extinction",

    "we have already presented the first result , the discovery of the segue 2 satellite @xcite .",
    "several more candidate objects were detected at similar significance level .",
    "pisces ii was selected for follow - up , as it showed tentative evidence for the presence of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars .",
    "the case for segue 3 was simpler : the object could actually be seen on the sdss images .",

    "it requires a lot of imagination to see the red giant branch or indeed the blue horizontal branch of pisces ii .",
    "however , the hess difference in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1_sdss ] shows that there are over - densities of blue - ish and reddish stars that can be interpreted as bhbs and rgbs at the heliocentric distance of @xmath42 kpc .",

    "[ fig : fig1_sdss ] presents the sdss data for segue 3 , which is clearly a simpler case : the main sequence ( ms ) at @xmath43 kpc is obvious .",
    "it is , however , more difficult to identify the rgb population in segue 3 as there is no obvious over - density in the hess difference plot . in the absence of spectroscopic data , we gauge the likely membership by placing a mask that selects six potential members , at least one of which probably belong to the galactic foreground .",
    "there is also a lone blue star in segue 3 , which looks slightly too faint to be classified as a bhb unambiguously .",

    "during the nights of 19 - 24 september 2009 , we obtained follow - up photometry of pisces ii and segue 3 using the mosaic camera at the 4-m mayall telescope at kitt peak national observatory , arizona . for both objects , we observed a single @xmath46 field for @xmath47 seconds in both @xmath34 and @xmath35 filters .",
    "each of mosaic s eight detectors have @xmath48 pixels with scale @xmath49 per pixel ( unbinned ) . for this run",
    "we enjoyed photometric conditions and typical seeing of @xmath50 .",
    "we processed raw mosaic frames using the set of iraf - based procedures that have been developed for the noao deep wide - field survey @xcite .",
    "these procedures include steps to correct for a pupil ghost that is caused by reflections off the atmospheric dispersion corrector .",
    "briefly , we used averaged dome flats to generate a template image of the pupil ghost , which we then removed from the master flat field image . after dividing science frames by the master flat field , we then scaled and subtracted the pupil template image from science frames one by one .",
    "visual inspection confirms that these steps successfully removed the pupil ghost from our science frames .",
    "data stacking and the production of catalogues was performed using a general purpose pipeline for processing wide - field optical ccd data  @xcite . for each image frame , an object catalog was generated and used to update the world coordinate system prior to stacking each set of 3 frames .",
    "a final set of object catalogs was generated from the stacked images and objects were morphologically classified as stellar or non - stellar ( or noise - like ) .",
    "the detected objects in each passband were then merged by positional coincidence ( within @xmath51 ) to form a combined @xmath52 catalogue and photometrically calibrated on the sdss system using stars in common .    _ pisces ii _  the kpno photometry reaches at least 2 magnitudes fainter than the sdss and plays a crucial role in the identification and analysis of pisces ii , as can be seen from fig .",

    "the rgb stars in pisces ii seem to be described equally well by both and , hence , are likely to possess metallicity in the range of @xmath55[fe / h]@xmath56 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the two brightest rgb stars are located right on top of the m13 ridgeline . to select all likely members of pisces",
    "ii , we draw a wide mask shown in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1_kpno ] ; we also select the bhb candidate stars with a color - magnitude box shown in the middle left panel . using these selection cuts",
    "we can now measure the structural parameters of pisces ii and its luminosity .",
    "the density contours of the rgb and msto stars are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] . to measure the satellite s half - light radius , ellipticity and position angle ,",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite . from the locations of candidate msto and rgb stars we measure a half - light radius of @xmath57 ( or @xmath2 60 pc at a distance of @xmath2 180 kpc ) with noticeable ellipticity .",
    "the results of this maximum likelihood fit are reported in table  [ tab : struct ] .    to estimate the total luminosity of pisces ii , we i ) integrate the flux inside the mask shown in the right - most panel of figure  [ fig : fig1_kpno ] within @xmath58 to get v@xmath59 mag ; ii )",
    "subtract an estimate of background contamination of @xmath60 mag ; iii ) add the contribution from the bhbs and possible blue stragglers ( bs ) of v @xmath61 to get @xmath62 . to account for the missing flux in the fainter stars , we use the luminosity function of the ursa minor dsph , which we integrate within @xmath63v@xmath64 to get 0.8 mag .",
    "this can be compared to 0.5 mag correction if the luminosity function of a typical globular cluster is used ( see e.g. @xcite ) . out of all ingredients contributing to the total luminosity , the exact number of rgb members of pisces ii carries the largest uncertainty .",
    "our final estimate of the luminosity of pisces ii is @xmath65 mag .    _",
    "segue 3 _  this satellite is one of the very few recent discoveries that can be seen seen directly in the sdss images .",
    "figure  [ fig : seg_image ] shows color images of 4@xmath66 area centered on segue 3 made with @xmath52 and @xmath36 sdss frames and @xmath34 and @xmath35 kpno frames .",
    "sdss and kpno data are of comparable quality , but the kpno frames are integrated longer and hence the faint objects are detected and measured with greater accuracy . on both images , a central concentration of bluish stars belonging to segue 3 can be seen , albeit with a somewhat irregular distribution .",
    "the kpno photometry presented in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : fig1_kpno ] reveals a rather tight main sequence , with a clear turn - off , which we use to estimate the distance modulus of ( m@xmath24m)@xmath67 . of the two ridgelines over - plotted on the satellite s cmd , m92 , with [ fe / h]@xmath2 - 2.3 , clearly provides a better match .",
    "we use the kpno data to derive the structural parameters of segue 3 by following the procedure mentioned above .",
    "the half - light radius of segue 3 is @xmath68 and , overall , its distribution of stars is circular ( see table  [ tab : struct ] ) , although there are some irregularities in the density profiles as can be seen from the right panel of figure  [ fig : density ] most likely due to the small numbers of stars .",
    "we calculate the luminosity of segue 3 in two steps , using both sdss and kpno data . for the ms members fainter than @xmath69",
    ", we integrate the flux within @xmath70 inside the mask shown in the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : fig1_kpno ] and subtract the estimate of the background contamination ( outside @xmath70 ) to get v@xmath59 . for the rgb members ( @xmath71 ) ,",
    "we integrate flux inside a narrower mask shown in the middle - left panel of figure  [ fig : fig1_sdss ] , which , after the background subtraction , gives v@xmath72 .",
    "so , the total v@xmath73 , or @xmath74 .",
    "this is accurate to not less than 0.5 mag and can be better constrained when the true rgb members are identified through spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "pisces  ii is close on the sky to pisces  i , discovered as an overdensity of rr lyraes by @xcite and confirmed spectroscopically by @xcite .",
    "but , at a heliocentric distance of @xmath0 kpc , pisces  ii is almost twice as far as away . the extent of pisces  i is probably considerable , at least as judged from the rr lyrae populations ( see figure 12 of watkins et al .",
    "this might imply the break - up of a substantial satellite galaxy moving on a radial orbit , in which case it is natural to interpret pisces  ii as a further fragment or companion .",
    "pisces  ii is very similar in morphology , size and luminosity to a number of recent discoveries such as hercules , leo  iv and leo  v  @xcite .",
    "they also all lie at similar heliocentric distances of @xmath75 kpc .",
    "all four have extended bhb populations enshrouding them .",
    "segue  3 is a very close relative of koposov  1 and 2 , the ultrafaint star clusters at distances of @xmath76 kpc  @xcite .",
    "all three objects have a similar size ( @xmath77 pc ) , luminosity @xmath78 and contain only a few tens of stars . unlike koposov  1 and 2 , segue  3 is much closer , and might even be a part of the hercules - aquila cloud  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of such objects is known to proceed with pronounced mass segregation .",
    "the very few heavy stars sink to the centre , and the lighter stars are ejected to form a diffuse corona .",
    "it would be interesting to verify this prediction with spectrocopic surveys of the objects .",
