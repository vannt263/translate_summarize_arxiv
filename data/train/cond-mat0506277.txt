    "proximity effects are phenomena stipulated by a penetration of an order parameter ( of some state ) from one material into another , which does not possess such type of the order itself , due to the materials being in contact .",
    "the leakage of superconducting correlations into a non - superconducting material is an example of the superconducting proximity effect . for a nonmagnetic normal metal ( n ) in contact with a superconductor ( s ) , the proximity effect has been intensively studied and well understood many years ago [ 1,2 ] .",
    "however , in the case of sn structures we deal with a single type of order - superconductivity .",
    "when a normal nonmagnetic metal is replaced by a ferromagnet ( f ) , the physics of proximity effect is much more interesting and rich [ 2 - 20 ] .",
    "there are two competing states with different order parameters : superconductivity and ferromagnetism . due to the difference in energy between spin - up and spin - down electrons and holes under the exchange field of a ferromagnet , a singlet cooper pair , adiabatically injected from a superconductor into a ferromagnet , acquires a finite momentum @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is  an extra energy caused by the intrinsic magnetic field @xmath3 in ferromagnet",
    "; @xmath4 is the fermi velocity , @xmath5 is the planck constant , and @xmath6 is the bohr magneton ) . as a result ,",
    "proximity induced superconductivity of the f layer is spatially inhomogeneous and the order parameter contains nodes where the phase changes by @xmath7 .",
    "particularly , transport properties of tunnel sf structures in the @xmath7-phase  state have turned out quite unusual .",
    "the phase shift of @xmath7 in the ground state of the junction is formally described by the negative critical current @xmath8 in the josephson current - phase relation : @xmath9 .",
    "the  @xmath7-phase  state of an sfs weak link due to cooper pair spatial oscillation was first predicted by buzdin _",
    "et al_. , [ 4,5 ] .",
    "experiments that have been performed by now on sfs weak links [ 6 - 8 ] and sifs  tunnel junctions [ 9 ]  directly prove the @xmath10-phase superconductivity ( i denotes an insulator ) .",
    "planar tunneling spectroscopy also reveals a @xmath7-phase shift in the order parameter , when superconducting correlations coexist with ferromagnetic order [ 10 ] .",
    "the superconducting phase was also measured directly [ 11 ] using squid s made of @xmath7-junctions .",
    "there is another interesting case of a thin f layer , @xmath11 , being in contact with an s layer . as far",
    "as the thickness of the f layer , @xmath12 , is much less than the corresponding superconducting coherence length , @xmath13 , there is spin spiltting but there is no order parameter oscillation in the f layer .",
    "surprisingly , but it was recently predicted refs . [ 12,13 ] that for sfifs tunnel structures with very thin f layers one can , if there is a parallel orientation of the f layers magnetization , turn the junction into the @xmath7-phase state with the critical current inversion ; if there is an antiparallel orientation of the f layers internal fields , one can even enhance the tunnel current .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "[ 14,15 ] , that physics behind the inversion and the enhancement of the supercurrent in this case differs from that proposed by buzdin _",
    "et al . _     while proximity induced superconductivity of the f metal in sf hybrid structures has been intensively studied , much less attention has been paid to a modification of the electron spectrum of a superconductor in a region near the s / f interface due to a leakage of magnetic correlation into the superconductor .",
    "some feature of the induced magnetism ( e.g. , the spin - splitting of the density of states ) were found by numerical calculations in refs .",
    "[ 16 - 18 ] . to our knowledge",
    ", only recently the question of s metal magnetization has been addressed in refs . [ 19,20 ] .",

    "this spin rotation occurs only as a result of a tunneling by the quasiparticle into the classically forbidden region of the boundary . due to the spin rotation",
    "the exchange field is induced in a superconductor on a distance of order of superconducting coherence length @xmath0 near an s / fi surface [ 21 - 23 ] . however , in contrast to ferromagnetic metals , where the proximity effect is pronounced , this effect is drastically reduced in s / fi structures . )    the investigation of a magnetic proximity effect in sf nanostructures is the purpose of this report . to tackle the physics , we consider an interesting and practicable case of an sf structure of a massive  superconducting and thin ferromagnetic layers .",
    "using a quasiclassical theory of superconductivity for proximity coupled bilayer ( sec .",
    "ii ) , we will show that for some limits the problem can be solved analytically .",
    "two limits will be discussed here : ( i ) a weak and ( ii ) a strong proximity effect .",
    "section iii is the key one ; here we describe the examples of the magnetic proximity effect manifestation .",
    "we show that  due to induced magnetism of the s metal : ( i ) the superconducting phase jumps at the s / f interface ; as well as , there are ( ii ) additional suppression of the order parameter near the s / f interface ; ( iii ) the spin splitting of the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) ; ( iv ) the appearance of the local bands inside the energy gap ; and , directly , in ( v ) induced equilibrium electronic magnetization of the s layer that spreads over distance of the order of the superconducting coherence length @xmath0 .",
    "we also briefly discuss recent experiments . summarizing the results in conclusion we draw attention to the fact that in the general case , for proximity coupled sf hybrid structures both phenomena - induced superconductivity of the f metal and induced magnetism of the s metal - take place simultaneously and should be considered self - consistently .",
    "let us consider proximity effects in the bilayer of a massive superconducting ( @xmath14 ) and a thin ferromagnetic ( @xmath11 ) metals , with arbitrary transparency of the s / f interface . here",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for the superconducting coherence lengths , @xmath17 are the diffusion coefficients , @xmath18 are the thicknesses of the s and f layers .",
    "( henceforth , we have taken the system of units with @xmath19 . )",
    "we assume the dirty  limit for both metals , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the electron mean free paths .",
    "it is also assumed that the superconducting critical temperature of the f material equals zero .",
    "all quantities are assumed to depend only on a single coordinate @xmath22 normal to the interface surface of the materials .",
    "we also expect that the f layer has a homogeneous ( monodomain ) magnetic structure with magnetization aligned parallel to the interface , so that there is no spontaneous magnetic flux penetrating into the s layer . under these conditions ,",
    "the only magnetic interaction which can affect the superconductor is the short - range exchange interaction between the superconducting quasiparticles and magnetic moments into the ferromagnet .",
    "as is well know , the superconductivity of dirty  metals is conveniently described by the quasiclassical usadel equations [ 24 ] for the normal , @xmath23 and  @xmath24 , and anomalous , @xmath25 and  @xmath26 , green functions , integrated over energy and averaged over the fermi surface .",
    "( green functions are defined in a standard way , see , e.g. ref . [",
    "it can be shown , that for singlet pairing and in the absence of spin - flip scattering , the whole system of usadel equations decomposes into two equivalent subgroups , which go over to each other under interchange of the spin indices ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 and reversal of the exchange field sign , @xmath29    it is convenient to take into account the normalization of the green function , @xmath30 , explicitly and to introduce [ 2 ] modified usadel functions @xmath31 , @xmath32 , defined by the relations @xmath33 , @xmath34 , etc .",
    "then we can recast the equations for the s layer in terms of these functions .",

    "@xmath44 is matsubara frequency . assuming the symmetry of the system with respect to the rotation in spin space both in the f and in the s layers",
    ", we drop the spin indices , apart from the specified cases .",
    "we  also put for the f metal a vanishing value of the bare superconducting order parameter @xmath45 , while the pair amplitude @xmath46 due to proximity with the superconductor .",
    "the equations for the functions @xmath47 and @xmath48  have a form analogous to ( 1)(3 ) ; note that @xmath49 . in eq .",
    "( 3 ) we write our formulas for the f metal using the effective coherence length of normal nonmagnetic ( n ) metal with the diffusion coefficient @xmath50 , @xmath51 , instead of @xmath52 , to have a possibility to analyze both limits @xmath53 ( sn bilayer ) and @xmath54 .",
    "the relation on the ferromagnetic layer thickness one may read as @xmath55 .",
    "( 1)-(3 ) should be supplemented with the boundary conditions in the bulk of the s metal and at the external surface of the f layer .",
    "far from the s / f interface , @xmath56 , for the s layer we have the usual boundary conditions in the bulk of the s metal : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the bcs value of the order parameter . at the external surface of the f metal @xmath59 . the relations at the s / f interface we obtain [ 26 ] by generalizing the results of kupriyanov and lukichev [ 27 ] for interface between two superconductors .",
    "the first condition on the usadel equations ensures continuity of the supercurrent flowing through the s / f boundary at any value of the interfacial transparency .",
    "going over to the modified usadel functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the first boundary condition has the form : @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the proximity effect parameter , which characterizes the intensity of superconducting correlations induced in the f layer , and vice versa , an intensity of magnetic correlation induced into the s layer ; @xmath62 are the resistivities of the metals in the normal state .",
    "the boundary condition ( 4 ) takes into account the effect of quasiparticle dos of the metals in contact .",
    "the second relation takes into consideration the effects of a finite transparency ( electrical quality ) of the interface . for @xmath63 - parametrization",
    "the second boundary condition becomes @xmath64 where  @xmath65  is the parameter that characterizes the effects of a finite transparency of the interface . for @xmath66 , i.e. , for a fully transparent boundary , condition ( 5 )",
    "goes over to @xmath67 .",
    "the expression for @xmath65 can be written through more convenient values : @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the product of the s / f boundary resistance and its area [ 27 ] .",
    "the relations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) generalize the proximity effect problem with an arbitrary interface transparency for the case of a normal metal with ferromagnetic order .",
    "the additional physical condition we assumed  is that the exchange splitting of the momentum subbands , @xmath70 , is substantially smaller than the fermi energy @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the effective mass of an electron ) . for most magnetic materials",
    "the momentum renormalization is not so important as the frequency renormalization , because @xmath73  while @xmath74 and due to this  the difference in the dos and transparencies of the s / f interface for electrons with opposite spin orientations can be neglected .    according to the green functions formalism ,",
    "if the functions @xmath75  and  @xmath76 are known , that is all we need to be able to describe , at least in principle , any superconducting and magnetic properties of the system .",
    "we draw attention to the feature important for further conclusions : due to superconductivity  these is only a single space length - the respective superconducting coherence length ,  @xmath77  or  @xmath78 , - that encounters into the differential equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "so , _ due to superconductivity the coordinate dependences of both superconducting and magnetic properties of each layer have the same typical space scale_.      the proximity effect for an sf structure with a thin f metal , @xmath79 , can be reduced to consideration of the boundary value problem for the s layer [ 2,26,28 ] . indeed ,",
    "the differential equation ( 3 ) can be solved by iteration with respect to the parameter @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . to a first approximation",
    "one can neglect the nongradient term and , taking into account that @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath83 . in the next approximation in @xmath81 we find , after linearizing eq.(3 ) , @xmath84 here we have again taken into account the condition that @xmath85 .",

    "the problem of the proximity effect for a massive superconductor with a thin ferromagnet layer reduces to solving the equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) for a semi - infinite s layer with the boundary conditions ( 7 ) on the external side and bcs type on infinity .",
    "the spatial dependence of the function @xmath96 in the f layer can be neglected due to the mesoscopic thickness @xmath97 of the latter ; eq . ( 8) determines the value of @xmath98 .",

    "_ spin discrimination means magnetism of a metal_. the penetration of the magnetic correlation into the superconducting layer is governed by the proximity effect parameter @xmath99 , i.e. , by the electron density of states on contacting metals . for high quasiparticle s density in the f metal in comparison to that in the s counterpart ( a large value of @xmath99 ) the equilibrium diffusion of these quasiparticles into the superconductor leads to an effective leakage of magnetic order into the s layer and strong suppression of superconductivity near the s / f interface .",
    "in the opposite case , @xmath100 , the influence of the f layer on properties of the s metal is weak ; it even vanishes if @xmath101 .",
    "opposite is the behavior of the superconductivity on this parameter .",

    "the phase shift can be summarized or subtracted , depending on mutual orientation of f layers magnetizations , leading to new effects in superonductivity of sf hybride structures .",
    "namely , one can show , that proximity induced magnetizm of the s layers makes preferrable the @xmath7-phase superconductivity of the system for parallel directions of the exchange fields ; for antiparallel magnetizations orientation and low temperature , the critical current can be even enhanced [ 12 - 15 ] .",
    "another feature of the s / f boundary is that the gap @xmath37 is suppressed near the interface more strongly than in the sn case .",
    "this is not surprising , since one would expect that induced ferromagnetism suppresses the superconducting order parameter at some distance into the s layer in excess of that for nonmagnetic normal layer .",
    "suppression increases with the increase of the exchange energy @xmath104  and of electrical quality of the interface ; far from the interface , @xmath56 , the bulk superconductivity is restored .    using @xmath87 ( 9 ) and the self - consistency condition ( 2 ) one can find the spatial variation of the order parameter in the @xmath102 layer @xmath128 for different values of @xmath95 and @xmath105 . the exchange interaction influence on the spatial variation of the order parameter in the s layer",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "1 . namely , the dependence of difference of the order parameters for the case when magnetic interaction is turned off ( i.e. , an sn  bilayer ) and with ferromagnetic correlation ( a sf bilayer ) as function of distance from the interface is shown ; the boundary parameters , @xmath99 and @xmath95 ,  are fixed .",
    "it is seen , that influence of magnetism decreases with increasing the distance from the s / f boundary .",

    "illustrate the spatial dependencies of  the induced exchange correlation in the superconductor for the case of vanishing interface resistance @xmath121 . with an increase of the sf boundary resistance the electrical coupling of the  s  and f  metals decreases and in the limit @xmath129 the metals become decoupled .",
    "spin splitting of dos and intergap states in the s layer are other manifestations of magnetic correlation leakage  into a superconductor .",
    "note that the magnetic layer does not influence the dos of the normal metal . in this case",
    "the decay length is extremely small @xmath130 and the effect can be neglected .",

    "that is why the existence of these magnetic properties of the s metal is quite important for sf nanoscale structures and should be taken into account while comparing theoretical results with experimental data . summarizing the results",
    ", we should stress that for sf nanoscopic hybrid structures both phenomena ,  the superconducting and the magnetic proximity effects ,  take place simultaneously , and both should be paid attention to .    _",
