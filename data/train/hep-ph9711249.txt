    "a number of indications seem to point to neutrinos having a mass .",
    "first of all there is the solar neutrino problem which is by far the strongest evidence we have for neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are also indications of a non - zero neutrino mass from atmospheric neutrino data @xcite and , lastly , one group claims to have seen evidence for neutrino oscillations in a laboratory neutrino beam also indicating a non - zero neutrino mass @xcite . now , from laboratory experiments an upper limit to the tau neutrino mass can be obtained , which is presently @xmath1 mev @xcite . from cosmology",
    ", we have the well known limit on stable low mass ( @xmath2 ) neutrinos @xcite @xmath3 using a present photon temperature of 2.736 k. @xmath4 is the dimensionless hubble constant and @xmath5 is the cosmological density parameter .",
    "@xmath6 for one flavor of neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "since observations demand that @xmath7 @xcite , we have a mass limit on any given stable neutrino .",
    "annihilation is included @xcite . ] thus , any neutrino with mass in the range 100 ev - 24 mev is necessarily unstable .",
    "there are , however , many possible modes of decay for a massive neutrino .",
    "for example there is the predicted decay @xcite @xmath8 if the mass is larger than @xmath9 and the mixing angle between the two neutrinos is different from zero .",
    "a flavour changing neutral current can also lead to the decay @xmath10 .",
    "there can also be other more exotic modes of decay , for example decay via emission of scalars or pseudo - scalars .",
    "this decay mode is generic for example in the majoron models of neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "the effect of such unstable tau neutrinos on nucleosynthesis have been investigated many times in the literature @xcite , the most recent investigations being those of dodelson , gyuk and turner @xcite and kawasaki et _ al .",
    "dodelson , gyuk and turner have performed a detailed study of several possible decay modes in the context of non - relativistic decays , whereas kawasaki et _ al .",
    "_ have performed a calculation using the full boltzmann equation for the decay mode @xmath11 @xcite . in all cases",
    "it is found that it is possible to change significantly the primordial abundances via decay of the tau neutrino .    in the present paper we focus on the decay @xmath12 where @xmath13 is assumed to be a majorana particle and",
    "@xmath0 is a light scalar or pseudoscalar particle .",
    "this differs from the decay @xmath11 in that it includes an electron neutrino in the final state .",
    "since @xmath14 enters directly into the weak interactions that interconvert neutrons and protons this decay can potentially alter the outcome of nucleosynthesis drastically . indeed",
    "the non - relativistic results of dodelson , gyuk and turner indicate that the primordial helium abundance , y@xmath15 , can be changed radically , either increasing or decreasing y@xmath15 depending on the mass and lifetime of the tau neutrino .",
    "now , in the last few years , evidence has been gathering that the standard picture of the way light nuclei are formed in the early universe may be facing a crisis @xcite .",
    "the main point is that helium is overproduced relative to the other light nuclei so that the standard theoretical predictions are only marginally consistent with the observational results @xcite",
    ". other measurements of the primordial helium abundance do yield somewhat higher values @xcite , and the unknown systematical errors both in observations and in chemical evolution calculations may , however , be larger than presently assumed so that it is perhaps premature to talk of a real `` crisis '' for big bang nucleosynthesis",
    ".    our approach will not be so much to discuss the specific limits from nucleosynthesis since these are still quite uncertain as it will be a discussion of the differences between our way of solving the boltzmann equations and those previously used .",
    "nevertheless , in light of the possibility that some new element is missing from the standard nucleosynthesis calculations we think that it is important to try and find methods of changing the nucleosynthesis predictions by including plausible new physics in the calculations .",
    "one possible way of doing this is to include a massive and unstable tau neutrino .    in order to obtain good fits to the observational data it is , as just mentioned , necessary to lower the helium abundance somewhat compared to the other light nuclei",
    "this can be achieved by having relatively low mass tau neutrinos decay while they are still relativistic or semi - relativistic . however , this is exactly the region where the non - relativistic formalism breaks down because it assumes a delta function momentum distribution of the decay products and neglects inverse decays .",
    "it is therefore of significant interest to investigate this decay using the full boltzmann equation in order to calculate abundances in this parameter region .    in the present paper",
    "we calculate the expected primordial abundances for a tau neutrino mass in the range 0.1 - 1 mev . in section ii we describe the necessary formalism needed for this calculation . in section",
    "iii we discuss our numerical results .",
    "section iv contains a description of our nucleosynthesis calculations compared to the observational data and finally section v contains a summary and discussion .",
    "the fundamental way to describe the evolution of different particle species in the early universe is to use the boltzmann equation @xmath16 = \\sum c_{i}[f],\\ ] ] where the sum is over different possible collisional terms for the given particle , such as decay , scattering and pair - annihilation . in our case",
    ", we include the standard weak interactions of neutrinos with each other and with electrons and positrons .",
    "furthermore we include a decay term .",
    "we shall assume , however , that the scalar particles are collisionless except for the decays and inverse decays . that is , they have no self interactions and no other interactions with neutrinos .",
    "this may or may not be a good assumption , depending on the various coupling constants .",
    "it greatly simplifies the calculations , however .",
    "now , the various terms in the boltzmann equation can be written as follows @xmath16 = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}-\\frac{\\text{d } r } { \\text{d } t}\\frac{1}{r}p\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p},\\ ] ]    since there are only 2-particle interactions like @xmath17 , @xmath18 can be written as    @xmath19 & = & \\frac{1}{2e_{1}}\\int d^{3}\\tilde{p}_{2 } d^{3}\\tilde{p}_{3}d^{3}\\tilde{p}_{4 } \\lambda(f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},f_{4})\\times   \\label{integral}\\\\   & & s \\sum \\ ! \\mid \\ !",

    "@xmath22 is a symmetrization factor of 1/2 ! for each pair of identical particles in initial or final states @xcite , and",
    "@xmath23 is the weak interaction matrix element squared and spin - summed .",
    "the matrix elements for the relevant processes have been compiled for example by hannestad and madsen @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 is the four - momentum of particle @xmath25 .",
    "since we are only looking at majorana neutrinos the decay terms are quite simple .",
    "since there is almost no net lepton number in the early universe the majorana neutrino is effectively an unpolarised species .",
    "however , this means that there can be no preferred direction in the rest frame of the parent particle .",
    "therefore the decay is necessarily isotropic in this reference frame . in this case",

    "apart from the boltzmann equation one needs equations to relate the evolution of time , the cosmic expansion rate and the photon temperature . these quantities can be calculated by use of the energy conservation equation @xmath39 and the friedmann equation @xmath40 @xmath41 is the cosmological scale factor , @xmath42 is the hubble parameter and @xmath43 is the total energy density of all particles present .",
    "we have solved the boltzmann equation for the evolution of distribution functions together with the energy conservation equation , eq .",
    "( [ conserve ] ) , and the friedmann equation , eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) .",
    "specifically we have solved for masses of 0.1 - 1 mev and lifetimes larger than 0.1 s.    = 7truecm    [ fig1 ]    in fig .",
    "1 we show the evolution of energy density in neutrinos and the pseudoscalar particle for a tau neutrino mass of 0.5 mev .",
    "the energy density evolves quite differently in the different cases .",
    "since the energy density in a non - relativistic species only decreases as @xmath44 compared to @xmath45 for relativistic particles the rest mass energy of the tau neutrino will dominate completely at late times if it is stable .",
    "if it decays the rest mass energy is transferred into relativistic energy so that the total energy density no longer increases relative to that of a single standard massless neutrino species .",
    "this difference is clearly seen between different tau neutrino lifetimes .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the spectral distribution of the electron neutrino for a tau neutrino mass of 0.5 mev and different lifetimes . to understand this plot better",
    "we can define a `` relativity parameter '' , @xmath46 , for the decay @xmath47 a particle shifts from relativistic to non - relativistic at a temperature of roughly @xmath48 . when the universe is radiation dominated @xmath49    = 7truecm    therefore , if the decay is relativistic , @xmath50 thus , if @xmath51 the decay is relativistic , whereas if @xmath52 it is non - relativistic . for lifetimes of 1 ,",
    "10 , 100 and 1000 s the relativity parameters are respectively 0.028 , 0.28 , 2.78 and 27.8 . for non - relativistic decays the decay neutrino distribution assumes a rather narrow shape coming from the delta function energy distribution .",
    "for very short lifetimes the decay installs an equilibrium between @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath0 because of rapid inverse decays .",
    "this can lead to a significant depletion of high momentum electron neutrinos as also noted by madsen @xcite who treated this case of very short lifetimes using equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "in order to estimate the effect on nucleosynthesis , we have employed the nucleosynthesis code of kawano @xcite , modified in order to incorporate a decaying neutrino . this includes taking into account the changing energy density as well as the change in electron neutrino distribution .",
    "a decaying tau neutrino can affect nucleosynthesis in several different ways .",
    "firstly , the cosmic energy density @xmath43 is changed . since the cosmic expansion rate is given directly in terms of this energy density via the friedmann equation , eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) , it is also changed .",
    "it is a well known fact that increasing the energy density leads to an earlier freeze - out of the n - p conversion and therefore produces more helium @xcite , whereas decreasing the energy density decreases the helium fraction .",
    "this is the effect discussed by kawasaki et _ al . _",
    "@xcite , namely that an mev neutrino decaying into sterile daughter products while still relativistic or semirelativistic can actually decrease the cosmic energy density thereby decreasing the helium abundance .",
    "however , there is also another another effect stemming from the change in electron neutrino temperature .",
    "since the electron neutrino enters directly into the n - p processes this can be called a `` first order '' effect and is potentially much more important than the `` second order '' effect of changing the energy density .",
    "this effect of change in the electron neutrino temperature has already been discussed by several authors in the context of non - relativistic decays @xcite .",
    "= 7truecm    if the decay is non - relativistic , the energy of a produced electron neutrino is @xmath53/2 .",
    "if this energy is significantly above the energy threshold for the two processes @xmath54 and @xmath55 the decaying tau neutrinos will act to produce more he @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the absorption cross section at high energies is the same on neutrons and protons .",
    "since there are many more protons present than neutrons , more neutrons will be produced . in the end",
    "this leads to a higher helium fraction .",
    "however , if the mass of the decaying neutrino is below this threshold the produced electron neutrinos will stimulate the conversion of neutrons into protons thereby actually decreasing the he abundance . this effect",
    "then competes with the rest mass effect which increases y@xmath15 .    if the decay is relativistic the electron neutrinos are produced at roughly thermal energies .",
    "effectively this amounts to increasing the electron neutrino temperature .",
    "this in turn leads to a decrease in helium production .",
    "if the decay takes place at high temperatures it is because beta equilibrium is kept for a longer time , whereas if the decay takes place at temperatures below the threshold for proton to neutron conversion it still leads to lower helium abundance because an increase in the electron neutrino temperature stimulates the conversion of neutrons to protons over the inverse reaction .    in fig .",
    "3 we show contour lines for the helium abundance as function of neutrino mass and lifetime .",
    "it is seen that helium can be significantly suppressed relative to the standard case if the lifetime is short enough and increased if the mass and lifetime are both high .",
    "if the mass and lifetime are both sufficiently high the helium abundance is instead increased .",
    "notice also that even for small masses of the order 0.1 mev the helium abundance can be changed significantly compared to the standard value for rather a large range of lifetimes .",
    "3 should be compared with for example the results of terasawa and sato @xcite or dodelson , gyuk and turner @xcite obtained using non - relativistic theory .",
    "the most straightforward comparison is with figs .",
    "2b and 3b in ref . @xcite . for long lifetimes",
    "the difference is quite small as would be expected since this is the non - relativistic limit .",
    "however , for short lifetimes the difference is significant .",
    "for very short lifetimes , our calculated he abundance is larger than that of terasawa and sato .",
    "the reason is that if one uses the full boltzmann equation in this case , decays and inverse decays will bring the particle distributions into equilibrium as discussed in sec .",
    "thus , if one keeps on going to shorter and shorter lifetimes nothing new happens since it is already decay in equilibrium .",
    "therefore our curve for he flattens out instead of decreasing for very short lifetimes . for somewhat longer lifetimes our he abundance is on the other hand smaller than that found by terasawa and sato",
    "the reason here is that the decay produces a peak of very low momentum electron neutrinos and that these states are not upscattered because the weak interactions have already frozen out . in the end",
    "this produces a somewhat colder electron neutrino distribution than would have been obtained using non - relativistic theory and therefore predicts less helium .",
    "this low momentum peak can be seen in fig .  2 for the example of a 0.5 mev @xmath31 neutrino .",
    "for non - relativistic decays this peak disappears because low momemtum states are not energetically accessible .",
    "in essence our predicted curve for the he abundance is therefore much flatter at short or intermediate lifetimes than what one would obtain using the non - relativistic formalism .",
    "for very long lifetimes our calculation fits fairly well with that obtained by terasawa and sato as could be expected .",
    "= 7truecm    in fig .",
    "4 we show the abundance of d , @xmath56he and @xmath57li for a specific example of m = 0.5 mev .",
    "we see that the abundances of these elements only change by relatively small amounts even for great variations in neutrino lifetime .",
    "thus , the main effect of the decay is to lower the helium abundance while leaving the other abundances more or less unchanged .",
    "the calculated abundances for different masses and lifetimes are compared with observational limits .",
    "unfortunately there is a great deal of controversy connected with these .",
    "however , since our main emphasis is on the differences between our approach to solving the boltzmann equations and the non - relativistic approximations previously used , and not so much on the specific nucleosynthesis limits to tau neutrino mass and lifetime we will not go into too much detail regarding this point .",
    "for @xmath58he we use the value calculated by hata et _ al .",
    "_ @xcite of @xmath59 for deuterium the situation is somewhat complicated . from measurements in the local interstellar medium one can obtain a deuterium abundance of @xcite @xmath60 which can be viewed as a lower limit to the primordial abundance .",
    "however , some recent results from qso absorption systems seem to indicate a primordial value much higher than this @xcite @xmath61 other similar observations yield much lower values , closer to the local one @xcite . in light of the controversy of using deuterium results from these measurements",
    ", we use the locally obtainable lower limit in the present paper . from evolution arguments",
    "one can also obtain an upper limit to the primordial d+@xmath56he abundance of @xcite @xmath62 finally for the abundance of @xmath57li we use a bound of @xmath63 obtained by copi , schramm and turner @xcite .",
    "= 7truecm    altogether these are the observational values which the theoretical predictions should be able to reproduce . in the standard model",
    "the theoretical predictions are only marginally consistent with observations because helium is overproduced compared to the other light nuclei . in our scenario",
    "this problem is resolved by having the tau neutrino decay during nucleosynthesis into an electron neutrino final state .    in fig .",
    "5 we show the allowed region of lifetime versus mass for the tau neutrino using the above constraints . in all the mass interval from 0.1 - 1 mev it is possible to obtain a fit to the observed abundances .",
    "note however , that for masses in the high end of this region a fit can only be obtained in a very narrow lifetime interval .",
    "this is because of the very steep dependence of @xmath64 on the lifetime in this region . for lower masses",
    "a good fit can be obtained in a broad region of lifetimes .",
    "another important fact is that since the helium abundance is lowered without disturbing greatly the other abundances , the upper and lower bound on the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath65 , is now given essentially only by the limits coming from d , @xmath56he and @xmath57li .",
    "this also means that a relatively high value for @xmath65 can be accommodated , about @xmath66 , coming from requiring that @xmath57li should not be overproduced .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the allowed region of @xmath67 as a function of tau neutrino lifetime for three different masses . we have also plotted the upper and lower limits to @xmath67 from the standard calculation .",
    "we have studied the decay of a relatively low mass tau neutrino into an electron neutrino and a scalar or pseudoscalar particle using the full boltzmann equation .",
    "it was found that the primordial helium abundance , y@xmath15 , can change drastically compared to the standard value .",
    "this is in concordance with the findings of previous authors who used a non - relativistic treatment @xcite .",
    "our actual numerical values differ significantly from those previously obtained by use of non - relativistic formalism , but the general trend is the same , namely that low mass neutrinos decaying while relativistic or semi - relativistic lower the helium abundance .",
    "the decay we have studied differs completely from the @xmath11 decay studied by kawasaki et _ al . _ @xcite because the electron neutrinos directly affect the weak reaction rates that interconvert neutrons and protons .",
    "only if much more reliable estimates of the primordial abundances are developed will it be possible to discern between the two different decay modes .",
    "our aim has mainly been to discuss the differences between using the full boltzmann formalism and using the non - relativistic approximation in doing these calculations .",
    "we have not done very detailed statistical analysis in order to obtain strict nucleosynthesis limits .",
    "however , it was shown that a good fit to the observed primordial abundances can be achieved for a large range of different masses and lifetimes .",
    "given the possibly large unknown systematical errors in the observations and chemical evolution models it is perhaps too early to talk of a real crisis for big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , once the observational bounds become more strict there might very well turn out to be such a crisis .    in light of this possible discrepancy between observed and predicted abundances",
    "we still feel that it is important to explore possible ways to change the light element abundances via plausible introduction of new physics .",
    "the tau neutrino decay into an electron neutrino final state is just such a possibility .",
    "perhaps one should also finally note that even if the helium abundance turns out to have been significantly underestimated a tau neutrino decay of the type we have discussed can still make nucleosynthesis predictions fit the observations , but for completely different values of mass and lifetime .",
