    "great interests are attracted on the studies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) due to the recent discovery of superconductivity in these system .",
    "the pahs compound , such as phenanthrene@xcite ( c@xmath2h@xmath3 ) , picene@xcite ( c@xmath4h@xmath2 ) , coronene@xcite ( c@xmath5h@xmath6 ) , and 1,2:8,9-dibenzopentacene@xcite ( c@xmath7h@xmath8 ) , are found to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures from 5 to 33 k by doping alkali or alkali - earth metal .",
    "in contrast to the previous organic superconductors , such as tetrathiafulvalene ( ttf),@xcite bis - ethylenedithrio - ttf(bedt - ttf , abbreviated as et),@xcite and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene ( tmtsf)@xcite derivatives , hydrocarbon superconductors are novel superconducting materials with intriguing properties . based on previous discoveries , @xmath9 of hydrocarbon superconductor is enhanced with the increasing number of benzene rings,@xcite reaching the highest @xmath9 = 33.1 k in organic superconductos comparable to the carbon based superconductor metal - doped fullerides@xcite ( @xmath9 = 38 k ) under pressure .",
    "the feature of  armchair \" edge type , which is regarded as a key factor of superconductivity in such a system , is shared in the hydrocarbon superconductors in contrast to the  zigzag \" edge type.@xcite besides , hydrocarbon superconductors are also a low - dimensional system with strong electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions , and both of which may be involved in superconductivity as suggested by some theoretical works.@xcite    the mechanism of superconductivity in pahs is still beyond understanding due to the complexity in such a system .",
    "many theoretical works have been given some positive discussion in order to thoroughly understand the mechanism of superconductivity.@xcite rigid band approximation calculations on k@xmath10picene show that the electrons transfer to the organic molecule from intercalated potassium atom and occupy its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital , leading to a metallic state .",
    "however , this approximation is not considered the influence of electron - intramolecular - vibration interaction in k - doped picene , and the important electron - phonon interaction is experimentally evidenced by the photoemission spectroscopy.@xcite therefore , the charge transfer from the intercalated potassium atoms is expected to play an important role on the superconductivity of pahs . meanwhile ,",
    "the importance of electron - intramolecular - vibration interaction can not be simply ignored in the investigation of the superconducting properties in this family .",
    "phenanthrene is the simplest molecule with an arm - chair conjuration that consists of three benzene rings .",
    "there is a larger superconducting volume fraction in cation doped phenanthrene compared to the other pah based superconductors .",
    "@xcite the relationship between cation doping and superconductivity has not been established yet .",
    "it remains uncertain whether adding more cation element would be favor of superconductivity in this material .",
    "raman scattering is a useful technique to study the vibrational properties of the aromatic hydrocarbon molecules@xcite and their doped derivative compounds.@xcite this technique has been proven very powerful in the determination of @xmath1 value in a@xmath0c@xmath11 and a@xmath0picene.@xcite this method is a direct probe of the amount of the electrons those transferred to the molecule based on the shifts of the raman modes .",
    "previous investigations show that for a@xmath0c@xmath11 and a@xmath12picene , each electron contributes 6 - 7 @xmath13 in the raman modes .",
    "in this work we report a detailed raman scattering study of k@xmath0phenanthrene ( 0 @xmath14 @xmath1 ( nominal ) @xmath14 6 ) at room temperature .",
    "we determine the amount of electrons transferred to the phenanthrene molecule .",
    "our results suggest the phase separation and intermediate phase in the nominal @xmath1 range from 0 to 6.0 . combining with density functional calculations , a constrain on superconductivity of potassium intercalated",
    "phenanthrene is obtained .",
    "phenanthrene of 98% purity , colorless crystal , was purchased from alfa aesar , which was used without further purification . for each composition ,",
    "phenanthrene powder was mixed with potassium at a nominal @xmath15 value in a glass tube , and the glass tube was sealed at 10@xmath16 par .",
    "then , the sample was heated to the temperature at about 470 k for 40 hours .",
    "after the annealing process , the sample turns into uniform dark black color . the magnetic susceptibility and raman spectrum measurements",
    "were conducted for the synthesized sample without any exposure to air .",
    "the magnetization @xmath17 was measured with the squid magnetometer ( quantum design ) at applied field @xmath18 of 10 oe in a temperature range from 2.5 k to 8 k. raman spectra were measured in backscattering geometry with visible laser excitation ( 633 nm ) with power less than 5 mw at room temperature .",
    "all the samples were sealed in capillaries without the exposure to air .",

    "raman spectra of k@xmath0phenanthrene are shown in fig .",
    "1 with different @xmath1 value from 0 to 6.0 .",
    "the spectrum of pristine phenanthrene agrees well with previously published data .",
    "there are four intense raman peaks ( originally at 409 , 829 , 1036 , 1350 @xmath13 ) that can be made a comparison between pristine and metallic intercalated phenanthrene .",
    "all raman modes of the k@xmath0phenanthrene obviously shift to the lower frequencies as the intercalation of potassium molecules .",
    "this indicates an raman mode softening effect .",
    "the doping - induced downshift is pretty consistent with the previous studies of the similar materials , such as a@xmath0c@xmath11 ( a = k , rb ) and k@xmath0picene .",
    "these softening effects can be understood by the charge - transferred effect and the corresponding elongation of the intralayer c - c bond length due to the intercalation of alkali metal into these solids .    in the case of k@xmath19phenanthrene which exhibits superconductivity ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , there are 22 @xmath13 downshift for the 1350 @xmath13 mode . in the study of k@xmath10phenanthrene,@xcite superconductivity only occurs when the composition of alkali metal equals three .",
    "this phenomenon is also consistent with the studies of k@xmath0picene in which superconducting transition was observed when the intercalation of alkali metal closes to three .",
    "consequently , it is expected to have three electrons transferred to the phenanthrene molecule in superconducting phase and thus each electron contributes to 6 or 7 @xmath13 redshift of the raman modes at 1350 @xmath13 .",
    "phenanthrene showing superconducting transition at 5 k in the zfc and fc measurements at applied magnetic field of 10 oe . ]    actually , the redshift of the 409 and 1350 @xmath13 peak in k@xmath0phenanthrene is pretty consistent with the previous observation in k@xmath20picene,@xcite which provides a good probe for determining the amount of doping electrons .",
    "the downshifts of the raman modes are not the same with nominal value @xmath15 because of the different donations of alkali metal . the experimental frequencies for the raman peaks originally at 409 and 1350 @xmath13 are plotted as a function of @xmath1 for k@xmath0phenanthrene in fig .",
    "these two raman peaks roughly locate at three discrete values in nominal value @xmath15 from 0 to 6.0 , @xmath21 393 , 395 , 399 @xmath13 , and 1322 , 1325 , 1328 @xmath13 . in the previous studies on k@xmath0picene@xcite and a@xmath0c@xmath11",
    ", @xcite raman scattering can be applied to determine the @xmath1 value of these compounds . based on these analyses , there are two phases in k@xmath0phenanthrene which are k@xmath10phenanthrene ( 1328 @xmath13 ) and k@xmath22phenanthrene ( 1322 @xmath13 ) . besides , we found the other frequency ( 1325 @xmath13 ) intermediate between 1328 and 1322 @xmath13 , which suggests the existence of k@xmath23phenanthrene phase .",
    "similar with the case of k@xmath0picene , only three discrete phases can be produced in k@xmath0phenanthrene which is independent of the nominal value @xmath1 , and other phases with different composition of potassium can not be fabricated .    in these three possible phases ,",
    "only the phase of k@xmath10phenanthrene exhibits the superconducting transition based on the magnetization measurement .",
    "this obversion is consistent with the previous discovery of superconductivity@xcite in phenanthrene that only the sample with nominal composition of k@xmath10phenanthrene shows superconductivity in a series of k@xmath0phenanthrene samples with different potassium contents , and all other samples with @xmath1 deviation from 3 do not show any feature of superconductivity .",
    "however , our results suggest that the superconductivity of k@xmath0phenanthrene is not based on the nominal value but closely correlates with actual amount of electrons transferred to the molecule . in the hydrocarbon based and carbon based superconductor ,",
    "the donation of three electrons to a molecule plays an important role on the superconductivity , which is independent to the nominal donation of alkali metal .    ) on the nominal value @xmath1 in k@xmath0phenanthrene ( 0 @xmath14 @xmath1 @xmath14 6 ) . ]",
    "based on the analysis of the positions of raman modes , we observe three phases in k@xmath0phenanthrene . in all samples ,",
    "we only observe superconductivity in the phase ( @xmath1 = 3.0 ) .",
    "the sample of other phases do not show any features of superconductivity .",
    "additionally , the phases of k@xmath23phenanthrene and k@xmath22phenanthrene are much more stable than the superconducting phase ( k@xmath10phenanthrene ) .",
    "these two nonsuperconducting phases can be easily obtained in the sample of any nominal @xmath1 values .",
    "thus , the superconductivity is pretty dependent on the amount of electrons transferred to the aromatic molecule , and is also very sensitive to the external conditions especially the annealing condition .    in order to investigate the equilibrium established in our superconducting k@xmath10phenanthrene sample",
    ", we examined the the raman - active modes of k@xmath10phenanthrene after further annealing process ( shown in the fig .",
    "4 ) in comparison with the pristine phenanthrene .",
    "the blue line is the raman spectra annealing at 473 k for 40 hours showing apparent superconducting transition at 5 k. furthermore , we performed another annealing process at 453 k for 80 hours after the initial preparation .",
    "based on the magnetization measurement , superconductivity of k@xmath10phenanthrene disappears after the second annealing process . in the first annealing process",
    ", the most raman modes shift to lower frequencies due to the intercalation of potassium atoms .",
    "after further annealing procedure , however , some raman modes are different to those in the initial k@xmath10phenanthrene . the original vibration modes at 409 , 710 , 1036 , 1350 @xmath13 still remain but become weaker , and some new peaks occur in raman spectra .",
    "we can see that the raman spectra for k@xmath10phenanthrene prepared by shorter annealing time , where the peak shift to lower frequency at 1328 @xmath13 from 1350 @xmath13 on pristine phenanthrene . on the other hand ,",
    "the peak of k@xmath10phenanthrene prepared by longer annealing time , shift to a frequency at 1357 @xmath13 , showing that less electrons are transferred to the phenanthrene molecule from potassium atoms . besides the raman modes originating from phenanthrene molecule ,",
    "some new peaks are observed at 360 , 720 and 1270 @xmath13 in the sample prepared for longer annealing time , suggesting that the possible molecular arrangement or new material were produced in the further annealing process .",

    "dotted and solid lines are the lda and hse results , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    from the frequency range from 1500 - 1700 @xmath13 , these vibration modes represent the c - c stretching modes . in the raman spectra of k@xmath0phenanthrene ( nominal @xmath1=2.0 2.5 6.0 ) , most raman modes representing the c - c stretching modes disappear or become featureless .",
    "the featureless in this region is possibly related to the molecular distortion of benzene rings and slightly molecular arrangement due to the doping of potassium metal .",
    "this indicates that the rigid - band approximation is not valid in the calculations for hydrocarbons . by doping potassium metal and employing the density functional calculations ,",
    "we have theoretically investigated the crystal and electronic structures of solid k@xmath0phenanthrene .",
    "the calculations are performed using the vienna _ ab _ _ initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite based on the local density approximation ( lda).@xcite considering the effects of electronic correlations in potassium - doped pahs,@xcite the hybrid functionals method ( hse)@xcite is adopted to overcome the limitations of lda . figure 5 shows the calculated density of states for four selected doping concentrations . from the results based on lda ( dotted lines ) ,",
    "the solid k@xmath0phenanthrene exhibits the metallic feature at @xmath25 , and 3.5 while becomes to insulator at @xmath26 .",
    "noticeably , the density of states at fermi level for the dopings of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are visibly less than that of @xmath29 , which implies a decrease of superconducting electronic states when the @xmath15 deviates from 3 .",
    "in fact , under the effect of electronic correlations , the fermi level is located in the pseudo - gap of the electronic states of k@xmath30phenanthrene and k@xmath23phenanthrene systems , as shown hse results ( solid lines ) in fig .",
    "consequentially , the metallic feature is absent in the systems where deviating from @xmath29 , which also explains the disappearance of superconductivity in these materials .",
    "in addition , we also find that the arrangement of phenanthrene molecule and k atomic positions will result in the variations of density of states at fermi level .",
    "this indirectly indicates that the superconductivity in not only depends on the doping content of alkali metal but also depends on the molecular arrangement and the atomic position of alkali metal .",
    "however , the information of location of potassium atom is still opened and calls for the future structural determination especially from neutron diffraction for further exploring mechanisms of superconductivity .",
    "however , the doping constrain on superconductivity discovered here is important for understanding the mechanism of superconductivity al least in phenanthrene - based superconductors .",
    "in summary , we have performed raman scattering measurements on k@xmath12phenanthrene in order to identify the doping - superconductivity phase relation .",
    "we found that there exist three phases ( @xmath1 = 3 , 3.5 , 4 ) in k - doped phenanthrene .",
    "only the phase ( @xmath1 = 3 ) was found to exhibit the superconductivity at @xmath9 of 5 k. consequently , the donation of three electrons to a molecule is essential for superconductivity , which is independent to the nominal donation of alkali metal .",
    "this experimental finding of the cation constrain on superconductivity is helpful for designing or synthezing new hydrocarbon superconductors having higher transition temperatures .",
