    "the moyal - wigner - weyl quantization constitutes a phase space quantization method alternative to canonical or path integral quantizations , @xcite-@xcite . instead of wave functions and operators",
    "one deals with quasi - distribution ( wigner ) functions and ordinary c - functions in phase - space . the weyl - symbol associated with a general operator @xmath0 is given by",
    ", @xcite : @xmath1 in this framework the average of @xmath2 is evaluated according to the formula : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is proportional to the weyl - symbol of the quantum density matrix , @xmath5 , and is known as the wigner function of the system , @xcite . for a pure state ,",
    "@xmath6 , the wigner function can be shown to be of the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the solution of schrdinger s equation : @xmath9 the weyl `` transform '' establishes a biunivocal correspondence between the quantum algebra @xmath10 of observables with standard operator product @xmath11 and quantum commutator @xmath12 $ ] , on the one hand , and the `` classical '' algebra @xmath13 defined over the classical phase space @xmath14 with a `` star - product '' @xmath15 and a moyal sine - bracket @xmath16_m$ ] , on the other hand .",

    "one realizes immediately that in the limit @xmath20 , the star - product and the moyal bracket become the ordinary product of c - numbers and the poisson bracket , respectively .",
    "it is also easy to check that the dynamics of the wigner function is governed by the moyal bracket ( 4 ) : @xmath21_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the weyl symbol of the quantum hamiltonian , @xmath23 .",
    "if the time - independent wave function happens to be an energy eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 , then @xcite the wigner function @xmath26 satisfies an equivalent @xmath15-genvalue equation with identical @xmath15-genvalue : @xmath27 more generally , to every eigenstate @xmath28 with eigenvalue @xmath29 of some operator @xmath30 , there is one and only one associated stargenfunction @xmath31 , which is a solution of the stargenvalue equation : @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this stargenfunction allows for the evaluation of the probability of measuring the eigenvalue @xmath29 : @xmath33 it is important to emphasize that , in most cases , the advantage in the wigner approach does not reside in solving specific problems .",
    "rather , it should be regarded as a means to grasp certain conceptual aspects of quantum mechanics and its connection with classical mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , in some situations it could be a better starting point for finding solutions to specific problems .",
    "the wigner formulation is a useful tool to derive kinetic equations in particular regimes ( dilute gas , weakly interacting particles ) . in nonequilibrium",
    "statistical mechanics this is a familiar approach , @xcite . in collision",
    "processes the wigner methods are also a useful tool @xcite .",
    "contrary to the standard operator approach they display the important advantage of making possible the use of approximation methods similar to the ones used in the full classical treatment .",
    "furthermore the related subject of wigner trajectories @xcite provides a pictorial and practical tool to study collision process and it is of similar importance in the context of quantum chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "boundary value problems , on the other hand , are one of the cornerstones of quantum mechanics .",
    "these are much more realistic models and moreover they entail a discretization of observables spectra , which is one of the main features of quantum mechanics .",
    "they appear in virtually all branches of physics , ranging from quantum mechanics to general relativity , open strings and d - branes , where the non - commutative * -product and the moyal bracket also find several applications @xcite . in standard operator",
    "quantum mechanics some famous examples of boundary value problems include the kondo problem @xcite , quantum hall liquids with constriction @xcite and the callan - rubakov model @xcite .",
    "furthermore one of the simplest collision process is the collision against an impenetrable boundary and some standard examples of quantum chaotic systems are bounded @xcite .    in spite of the importance of boundary value problems in general and of these models in particular",
    ", wigner quantum mechanics does not provide a self contained and consistent formulation of confined systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus to provide such formulation .",
    "more precisely our aim is to generalize the two key equations of wigner quantum mechanics ( eq.(5 ) and eq.(6 ) ) to the case when the original wave function is confined to an interval and satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "let us then consider a general confined system . in standard operator",
    "quantum mechanics , we first solve the schrdinger equation in the bulk ( with hamiltonian @xmath34 ) , subsequently impose the boundary conditions that pin down the physical solutions and finally impose the wave function to be zero beyond the bulk . alternatively",
    ", we may be able to provide a boundary potential @xmath35 that confines the wave - function and then solve the unconstrained system , with extended hamiltonian @xmath36 and the original conditions at the boundaries .    to obtain the solution of the problem in terms of wigner functions",
    ", we just have to insert the solution obtained in the schrdinger formulation into the definition of the wigner function .",
    "this was the method followed in ref.@xcite .",
    "but the question that remains is : how do we solve the problem within the wigner - weyl formulation ?",
    "the first approach can not be easily translated into the wigner framework because the highly nonlocal character of the wigner function produces nontrivial effects of the boundary on the bulk part of the wigner function , so that the stargenvalue equation has to be altered , as we shall see ( sections 2 - 4 ) .",
    "the second procedure seems to be the natural starting point to derive , through the weyl map , the wigner formulation for the bounded system .",
    "however this is not an easy task , mainly because the formulation of confined systems in terms of boundary potentials is already problematic at the standard operator level . in section 6",
    "we will consider this approach and a ) consistently solve the problem at the standard operator level and b ) use the weyl map to recover the bounded stargenvalue equation derived in section 3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss some aspects of the boundary conditions satisfied by the wigner function . in sections 3,4 and 5",
    "we evaluate the boundary corrections to the @xmath15-genvalue equation ( 6 ) and the time evolution equation ( 5 ) directly from the general formula of the confined wave function .",
    "furthermore , we a ) extend baker s converse construction to bounded systems and b ) argue that the results obtained are compatible with the preservation of the wigner function s normalization under time evolution . in section 6",
    "we develop the boundary potential approach for standard operator quantum mechanics and show that through the weyl map this formulation yields the proper wigner formulation of confined systems . in section 7",
    "we discuss some practical applications of the formalism : the computation of wigner trajectories for confined chaotic systems and for collision processes .",
    "finally , in section 8 we present our conclusions .",
    "let us assume that the domain of the wave function is the finite interval @xmath37 with @xmath38 , so that the wave function vanishes outside this interval . as we now argue , quantum confined systems can not be treated , in the wigner formalism , through the standard procedure of solving a differential equation and imposing the boundary conditions thereafter . in particular , the energy stargenfunctions for these systems do not satisfy the stargenvalue equation ( 6 ) with the hamiltonian of the bulk .",
    "as an example , consider the free particle in the infinite well , with @xmath39 .",
    "the stargenvalue equation would be of the form : @xmath40 if we solve the corresponding schrdinger equation with dirichlet boundary conditions we get for the fundamental state : @xmath41 if we now determine the associated wigner function using ( 2 ) we get @xcite that @xmath42 is given by eq.(39,40 )",
    ". we can easily check that @xmath42 does not satisfy the previous stargenvalue equation and thus the only possible conclusion is that this equation has to be altered .",
    "similarly , we can check that the time - evolution of the system does not satisfy the moyal equation with bulk hamiltonian .",
    "let us start by studying the general properties of the wigner function for a confined system .",
    "since the wave function vanishes outside the interval @xmath43a , b \\right[$ ] , it satisfies the condition : @xmath44 this means that : 1 ) for @xmath45 , we have : @xmath46 similary , 2 ) for @xmath47 : @xmath48 and finally , 3 ) for @xmath49 or @xmath50 : @xmath51 we conclude that the wigner function ( 2 ) for the bounded system can be written as : @xmath52 where : @xmath53 @xmath54 is the heaviside s step function : @xmath55 iff @xmath56 and @xmath57 otherwise , and finally : @xmath58 since the wave function or its derivatives are possibly discontinuous at @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and to avoid possible misinterpretations in our future calculations , the previous integrals are defined as improper : @xmath61 stands for @xmath62 and likewise @xmath63 stands for @xmath64 .",
    "notice that this is fully compatible with our previous results identifying the domain where @xmath65 is not identically zero .    as a second remark",
    "let us point out that the boundary conditions on @xmath66 are imposed on the bulk side of the boundary .",
    "for instance , the dirichlet boundary conditions would be of the form : @xmath67 , which is not the same as requiring @xmath68 , since these are valid independently of the boundary conditions satisfied by @xmath66 .",
    "this is so because @xmath66 is confined to the open interval @xmath69a , b[$ ] .",
    "it is important to realize that we could equally choose to defined `` confined '' as `` confined to the close interval @xmath70 $ ] '' and in fact for dirichlet boundary conditions the two prescriptions yield exactly the same wave function .",
    "however , the confinement to an open interval makes some of the future steps more natural ( though occasionally more involved ) and this is why we choose to work with this prescription .    finally , and to make our future expressions more compact , we introduce the notation : @xmath71 which will be used whenever",
    "there is no risk of misunderstanding .",
    "let us then study the boundary conditions that are satisfied by the wigner function of a confined system . from (",
    "8 - 10 ) , one realizes immediately that : @xmath72 where , accordingly to the previous notation , @xmath73 stands for the limit @xmath74 and likewise for the other expressions .",
    "since @xmath42 is defined as an improper integral it already requires the evaluation of a limit .",
    "this limit will always be calculate before the limit @xmath75 , i.e. first we evaluate the wigner function for all @xmath76 and only then do we compute whatever limits of the wigner function . let us proceed : eq.(11 ) means that @xmath77 is continuous at @xmath78 and obeys dirichlet boundary conditions irrespective of the particular boundary conditions satisfied by the associated wave function @xmath79 .",
    "the boundary conditions obeyed by the confined wave function act only on the derivatives of the wigner function . for @xmath80",
    "a straightforward computation leads to : @xmath81 \\right\\ } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the argument . consequently : @xmath82 + \\\\ & \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{\\pi \\hbar } \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+ } \\int_{\\frac{a - b}{2}+\\epsilon}^{\\frac{b - a}{2}-\\epsilon } dy e^{-2i py / \\hbar } \\left [ \\psi'^ * ( x_0-y ) \\psi ( x_0+y ) + \\psi^ * ( x_0-y ) \\psi ' ( x_0+y ) \\right ] .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] similarly , from @xmath83 we get : @xmath84 + \\\\ & \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{\\pi \\hbar}\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+ } \\int_{\\frac{a - b}{2}+\\epsilon}^{\\frac{b - a}{2}-\\epsilon } dy e^{-2i py / \\hbar } \\left [ \\psi'^ * ( x_0-y ) \\psi ( x_0+y ) + \\psi^ * ( x_0-y ) \\psi ' ( x_0+y ) \\right ] .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] we conclude that in general @xmath85 , except for dirichlet boundary conditions ( i.e. @xmath86 ) , in which case the wigner function also obeys neumann boundary conditions : @xmath87",
    ". we can carry on with this process and compute the second and third derivatives .",
    "the results concerning the boundary conditions can then be summarized as follows .",
    "all wigner functions for bounded systems satisfy eq.(11 ) .",
    "these are consistency conditions and , given their general character , can not give countenance to the discretization of the energy spectrum .",
    "the boundary conditions satisfied by the confined wave function yield subsidiary conditions on the wigner function :    * dirichlet * : @xmath86 @xmath88 if a wigner function satisfies these neumann conditions , then it _ automatically _ verifies : @xmath89 obviously , this pattern does not continue indefinitely .",
    "for instance , @xmath90 .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that contrary to eq.(15 ) , the additional set of eqs.(16 ) , being just a consequence of eq.(15 ) , do not constrain @xmath91 any further .    *",
    "neumann * : @xmath92 @xmath93 we also have : @xmath94 .",
    "+ the former results show that the confinement of the system and the boundary conditions satisfied by the wave function influence the wigner function in a very non - trivial way .",
    "furthermore , the conditions ( 11,15,16 ) will play an important part in the derivation of the new @xmath15-genvalue equation for bounded systems .",
    "however , one should realize that the previous results also display some less interesting features : let us focus on the case in which the wave function satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "if the system is also confined then the wigner function will satisfy the set of conditions ( 11,15,16 ) .",
    "the problem is that the converse result is not valid , i.e. the conditions ( 11,15,16 ) do not imply the confinement of the system and it is also not clear if , in general , they imply that the original wave function satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions . hence , ( 11,15,16 ) will not completely pin down the wigner transform of the confined wave function satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions and thus eqs.(11,15,16 ) fail to provide the proper translation ( into the wigner language ) of the dirichlet boundary conditions on the wave function .",
    "we now introduce a new set of boundary conditions for the wigner function , which are fully equivalent to dirichlet boundary conditions on the original wave function , both for the confined as well as for the unconfined case .",
    "we call these conditions _ integral dirichlet boundary conditions _ and they can be derived as follows : if the wave function satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions then @xmath95 and similarly @xmath96 where @xmath97 stands for the probability distribution .",
    "these equations can be written in the wigner context quite straightforwardly : @xmath98 notice that the use of the limits is valid ( though unnecessary ) in the unconfined case ( where the wave function and its derivatives are continuous ) but it is necessary if the system is confined .    from the two sets of boundary conditions satisfied by the wigner function , ( eqs.(11,15,16 ) and eqs.(18 ) ) , the dirichlet integral ones are the most appealing both from the physical and the mathematical points of view : firstly , because they represent a physically meaningful imposition , that the probability of finding the particle at the boundary is zero . secondly , because they are fully equivalent to the dirichlet boundary conditions on the wave function . from eq.(7,18 ) , we get : @xmath99 and similarly for the @xmath100-boundary . finally , and to avoid a possible misinterpretation let us point out that eq.(11 ) does not imply the satisfaction of the conditions ( 18 ) given the fact that , in general , it is not possible to interchange the order in which one evaluates the limit and the integral in ( 18 ) .",
    "for instance , if a confined wave function satisfies neumann conditions then the wigner function will satisfy ( 11 ) but not ( 18 ) .",
    "let us henceforth assume that the wave function satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions , so that eqs.(11,15,16,18 ) are valid .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath101 is an energy - eigenstate for a hamiltonian of the form : @xmath102 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath91 ( 8) on the left - hand side of equation ( 6 ) , we get : @xmath103 a straightforward calculation leads to : @xmath104 f^w_1 + \\\\ \\\\",

    "in this section , we briefly review the topic of wigner trajectories @xcite , where the previous work may find some interesting applications .",
    "there are two well - known instances , where this concept plays an important role : collision processes @xcite and the study of quantum systems that exhibit chaotic behavior in the classical limit @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger and wigner formulations of a collision process are obviously equivalent .",
    "this notwithstanding , there are important practical differences between the two approaches . in most cases , where an exact solution to the problem is unknown",
    ", one has to devise some approximative scheme .",
    "if certain conditions hold ( concerning the interaction potential ) , the moyal equation ( 5 ) can be truncated to a good degree of accuracy .",
    "since it does not contain any operator , it is often easier do develop approximations on it than on the schrdinger equation .",
    "having computed the wigner function that solves this truncated version of the moyal equation , one can subsequently evaluate quantum corrections to the classical phase space trajectories .",
    "in addition to the benefit of this pictorial and intuitive description in terms of trajectories there is another advantage in this approach : collision cross sections can be computed by applying the same numerical techniques used in classical collision processes .",
    "another situation where the wigner trajectories play an important role is that of nonlinear systems exhibiting classical chaotic behavior . in these systems the classical phase space trajectories are of random nature",
    "while the wigner trajectories are smooth paths thus showing that the chaotic behavior disappears upon quantization .",
    "a topic of current interest is that of understanding the transition from classical to quantum dynamics . since the wigner trajectories might be computed as an @xmath293 order by order correction to the classical trajectories they provide a powerful , pictorial tool to study this transition .    in this section",
    "we will a ) shortly review the subject of wigner trajectories for unconfined systems , b ) discuss the main difficulties in extending the formalism to bounded systems and show that our previous results provide a new approach in this context and c ) illustrate these results using the simple example of a free particle confined to an infinite square well .",
    "the reader should be advised that our aim is not to provide a fully developed and precise formulation of these topics but only to outline ( and hopefully motivate ) some possible lines of research .",
    "let us then consider the moyal equation of motion ( 5 ) associated to @xmath294 : @xmath295 alternatively , we can write this equation as : @xmath296 where @xmath297 e^{-2i p y / \\hbar}.\\ ] ] in the absence of a boundary and if the potential @xmath298 is at most quadratic in @xmath76 , then the moyal equation ( 69 ) reduces to the liouville equation : @xmath299 the previous equation means that the solution @xmath300 evolves along the classical trajectories , i.e. : @xmath301 this motivates the concept of wigner trajectories . if we define an effective quantum potential",
    "@xmath302 according to : @xmath303 then we can express the moyal equation in the form : @xmath304 which can be interpreted in analogy with ( 72 ) , by stating that the wigner function evolves along the wigner trajectories given by : @xmath305 if an exact solution for @xmath91 is known , then we can , in principle , calculate the effective potential from ( 74 ) and subsequently solve ( 76 ) to obtain the wigner trajectories .",
    "however , in general , such is not the case .",
    "if the potential @xmath190 does not deviate appreciably from a quadratic potential then we can address the problem by iteratively evaluating order by order the quantum corrections to the classical trajectories @xcite .",
    "the zero order approximation ( i.e. the classical solution ) , satisfies the liouville equation : @xmath306 the order zero trajectories correspond to the classical hamilton equations .",
    "the order one equation is given by : @xmath307 if we solve this equation for @xmath118 and substitute in ( 75,76 ) , we obtain the first order trajectories : @xmath308 the second order approximation is : @xmath309 and yields the second order correction to the classical trajectories : @xmath310 this procedure can be carried on to any order in @xmath293 .",
    "its main advantage is that it transforms the problem of solving an infinite order partial differential equation ( the moyal equation ) into the problem of solving a sequence of first order partial differential equations",
    ". it also displays the advantage of casting the transition from classical to quantum dynamics as an order - by - order correction ( in @xmath293 ) to classical mechanics .",
    "there are , however , some weak points in the procedure , the most significant being perhaps that it is not always clear what is the degree of precision of an approximation to a given order nor if the entire scheme will converge .",
    "if a system has a boundary , then the former approximative scheme will obviously break down , because the boundary contribution was thus far unknown . as we have seen in the previous sections the boundary interaction has a non - local nature and will thus affect the wigner trajectories well inside the bulk part of the system .",
    "it therefore must equally contribute to the quantum corrections of the trajectories .    in this case one",
    "was left with a single possible approach : to solve the schrdinger equation for the confined wave function and compute the wigner function from it . in some cases where",
    "an exact solution of the schrdinger equation is known this method can be taken to completion .",
    "take for instance the simple example of a free particle confined to the interval @xmath69 - 1,1[$ ] and subject to dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the fundamental state is @xmath311 from which we can compute the wigner function eqs.(2,39,40 ) .",
    "since the particle is in an energy eigenstate we have : @xmath312_m=0 \\longrightarrow f^w(q(-t),p(-t),0)=f^w(q , p , t)=f^w(q , p,0),\\ ] ] and thus the wigner function evolves along the paths where it displays a constant value , i.e. the wigner trajectories @xmath313 are the equi - wigner curves . fig .",
    "4 displays the wigner trajectories for this simple system .    for more elaborate examples",
    "we are forced to use eq.(74 ) or eq.(75 ) to calculate the effective potential from the wigner function and then eq.(76 ) to calculate the wigner trajectories .",
    "for instance in @xcite a system in a symmetric box with dirichlet boundary conditions and an external driving force was considered .",
    "the force , which is of the form @xmath314 , induces classically the appearance of resonance .",
    "since the system has a boundary , quantum mechanically , the authors were compelled to work in the context of the schrdinger equation but since an exact , analytic solution is not known the wigner function and subsequently the wigner trajectories could not be obtained exactly .    in general ,",
    "the wave function based approach suffers from two major drawbacks : firstly , in some situations ( as in the previous example ) it is impossible to obtain an exact solution of the schrdinger equation which makes it difficult to infer what is the degree of precision of the resulting wigner function .",
    "secondly , even if an exact solution of the schrdinger equation is known , this method only provides the exact wigner trajectories and in some situations it is desirable that the quantum corrections to the classical trajectories might be computed order by order in @xmath293 .    the results of this paper",
    "provide a new approach to determine the wigner trajectories for bounded systems ( satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions ) from an exclusive phase space ( or c - number ) point of view .",
    "in fact most of the formalism for the unconfined case can now be applied to the bounded case as well .",
    "this is certainly true for eq.(69 - 71,74 - 76 ) where one just has to take into account that : 1 ) @xmath190 is no longer the bulk potential but it also encompasses a boundary contribution @xmath315 which is associated with the dirichlet boundary conditions and was given in eq.(53 ) : @xmath316 , 2 ) in the boundary corrections to eqs.(69,70,74 ) the wigner function should be evaluated at @xmath243 and @xmath317 ( in the left and right boundary correction , respectively ) .",
    "it is not so clear if the approximative scheme ( eq.(77 ) to eq.(81 ) ) can be also extended to the bounded case .",
    "this is because the boundary potential deviates strongly from the harmonic oscillator potential and yields contributions to the moyal equation to all orders in @xmath293 .",
    "we thus have to worry about the magnitude of these contributions and find a suitable criterion to determine the validity of the approximation .",
    "these issues are also a problem in the general unconfined case and are certainly not the subject of this paper .",
    "our point here is just that the boundary potential approach is , thus far , the unique exact formulation of confined systems that only appeals to phase space objects and it thus seems to be the proper framework from which the former or other , more suitable , approximative scheme may be devised .      in this section",
    "we ignore the issues of validity and convergence of the approximative scheme given by eqs.(77 - 81 ) and use it to compute the order by order quantum corrections to the classical trajectories of a free particle confined to the interval @xmath69 - 1,1[$ ] .",
    "quite remarkably , we will see that this ( in this context , very poor ) approximation procedure is already able to reproduce most of the qualitative behavior of the exact quantum trajectories .",
    "the exact wigner trajectories for a particle in the fundamental state are solutions of eq.(76 ) with the effective potential satisfying ( 74,75 ) and were displayed in fig .",

    "to simplify the discussion we assume that for sufficient small @xmath220 we have : @xmath321 and use these identities to transform eq.(83 ) into the liouville equation ( 77 ) with @xmath322 .",

    "2 ) and @xmath325 . for sufficient small @xmath220 these would be just the classical trajectories .",
    "we now compute the first order corrections eq.(79 ) .",
    "these are the solutions of : @xmath326 where we again ignored the contribution of the factors that involve the ( approximate ) wigner function .",
    "we get the trajectories displayed in fig .",
    "finally , we compute the second order corrections ( eq.(81 ) ) : @xmath327 and get the trajectories displayed in fig . 7",
    "several remarks are now in order : + a ) we see that the first order approximation already displays the deflection of the quantum trajectories towards regions of higher momentum as the particle approaches the boundaries .",
    "+ b ) in the second approximation the `` islands '' appear .",
    "they are not confined , as in the exact case , to regions of positive or negative momentum , but they are already confined to positive or negative positions . furthermore , the deflection to regions of high momentum is now an exclusive feature ( as in the exact case ) of the higher momentum trajectories .",
    "the slower ones are essentially classical .",
    "+ c ) not all wigner trajectories will be confined . for sufficiently high momentum",
    "they will escape from the box .",
    "this is because we are not using the true dirac delta but a gaussian approximation to it .",
    "the free wigner trajectories correspond to the part of the wave function that is outside from the box in fig .",
    "+ d ) the former approximative scheme can be refined at least in three different directions : firstly by taking into account the contributions of the factors that are proportional to the wigner function .",
    "our , rather simple approximative scheme , is in fact , state independent and so could not possibly reproduce the exact wigner trajectories .",
    "this step will be more demanding from the numerical point of view since one will be asked to solve the partial differential equation for the approximate wigner function before computing each order correction to the classical trajectories .",
    "secondly , by increasing the degree of approximation to the dirac delta function , i.e. by decreasing the spread @xmath220 .",
    "this is mandatory if one is interested in the behavior of the quantum trajectories of higher momentum .",
    "lastly , and quite obviously by computing higher order corrections in @xmath293 .",
    "in this paper we studied the wigner - weyl formulation of a particle confined to a finite interval and subject to dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we found that : 1 ) the standard procedure of solving the unconstrained system and then imposing the boundary conditions does not work out in the wigner - weyl formulation ; 2 ) the boundary conditions and the confinement of the wave function determine a boundary correction to the @xmath15-genvalue equation and to the moyal equation ; 3 ) dirichlet boundary conditions on the confined wavefunction imply both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on the corresponding confined wigner function .",
    "our main task was then the evaluation of the contributions of the boundaries to the @xmath15-genvalue equation ( 6 ) and to the time evolution equation ( 5 ) for a wave function satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "these contributions were shown to have the form of boundary potentials added to the hamiltonian , and the same potentials were obtained in the operator formulation of quantum mechanics , when we derived the schrdinger eigenvalue equation for the confined wave function @xmath199 . together with the boundary conditions they are responsible , both in the wigner and in the schrdinger formulations , for the confinement of the system and the consequent discretization of the energy levels . finally , we extended baker s converse construction to the bounded case , proving the full equivalence between the operator - schrdinger and the wigner formulation of the confined eigenvalue problem .",
    "lastly , we used our previous results to approach the problem of evaluating the wigner trajectories of bounded systems and ventured the possibility of applying these methods to non - linear systems displaying classical chaotic behavior .",

    "<S> we consider the general wigner function for a particle confined to a finite interval and subject to dirichlet boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the boundary corrections to the `` star - genvalue '' equation and to the time evolution equation . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections can be cast in the form of a boundary potential contributing to the total hamiltonian which together with a subsidiary boundary condition is responsible for the discretization of the energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a completely analogous formulation ( in terms of boundary potentials ) is also possible in standard operator quantum mechanics and that the wigner and the operator formulations are also in one - to - one correspondence in the confined case . in particular , we extend baker s converse construction to bounded systems . finally , we elaborate on the applications of the formalism to the subject of wigner trajectories , namely in the context of collision processes and quantum systems displaying chaotic behavior in the classical limit . </S>"
