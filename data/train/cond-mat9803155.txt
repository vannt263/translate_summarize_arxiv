    "the casimir effect is a phenomenon common to all systems characterized by fluctuating quantities satisfying some conditions on the boundaries of the system ( for a general review on the casimir effect see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the statistical mechanical systems",
    "the casimir force is usually characterized by the excess free energy @xmath15 due to the finite size contributions to the free energy of finite systems with a film geometry @xmath16 where boundary conditions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are imposed on the surfaces bounding the system across the direction @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the full free energy per unit area ( and per @xmath21 ) of such a system and @xmath22 is the corresponding bulk free energy density .",
    "the casimir force @xmath23 then arises naturally in the thermodynamics of these confined systems .    for @xmath24-symmetric model systems ( @xmath25 ) , depending on the boundary condition @xmath26 and on @xmath27 @xmath28 may or may not contain contributions independent of @xmath19 . for the ising - like systems ,",
    "i.e. @xmath29 these can be the surface free energies @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and the interface free energy @xmath32 ( for brevity we consider the dependence on the temperature @xmath9 only ) .",
    "for the @xmath33 models these will be only the contributions stemming from the surface free energies because the analog of the interface free energy is the helicity modulus @xmath34 and the corresponding contribution is of the order @xmath35 .",
    "in general _ at _ the critical temperature @xmath8 ( of the corresponding bulk , i.e. @xmath36 , system ) the full free energy @xmath37 has the asymptotic form @xmath38 where @xmath12 is the dimensionality of the considered system and @xmath39 is the so - called casimir amplitude .",
    "the @xmath19-dependence of the casimir term ( the last one in eq .",
    "( [ fattc ] ) ) follows from the scale invariance of the free energy and has been derived by fisher and de gennes @xcite .",
    "the amplitude @xmath40 is _ universal _ , depending on the bulk universality class _ and _ the universality classes of the boundary conditions @xcite , @xcite . in the present article we will only consider the case of periodic boundary conditions ( which implies that @xmath41 ) .",
    "then , according to the standard finite - size scaling theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a general review ) , near the critical temperature @xmath8 and in the presence of a small external magnetic filed @xmath42 the behavior of @xmath43 is given by    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the reduced temperature , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are nonuniversal scaling factors , @xmath49 is _ universal _",
    "( usually geometry dependent ) scaling function , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 and @xmath2 are the corresponding ( universal ) scaling exponents .",
    "an interesting point of view on the properties of the excess free energy comes from the finite - temperature generalizations of the zamolodchikov s",
    "@xcite for quantum systems with arbitrary dimensionality due to netto and fradkin @xcite ( see also zabzin @xcite ; for a general review on phase transitions in quantum system see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they define from the free energy a function @xmath6 of the coupling constants and the temperature which is a positive and , in the regimes where the quantum fluctuations dominate , a monotonically increasing function of the temperature .",
    "the @xmath6 function is , in fact , an _ analog of the excess free energy _ of the system that they consider .    before passing to a discussion of some details it seems necessary to comment on the well known point that for temperature driven phase transitions with @xmath52",
    "the quantum fluctuations are unimportant near the temperature critical point .",
    "therefore , it seems that the properties of the system around one quantum critical point ( with respect to a given quantum parameter , say , @xmath53 ) at @xmath54 can not tell us anything about the properties of this system around its temperature critical point @xmath55 in fact the dimensional crossover rule helps to make a bridge between these phenomena . according to this rule the critical singularities ( with respect to @xmath56 @xmath54 ) of a @xmath12-dimensional quantum system are _ formally _ equivalent to those of a @xmath57 classical one ( @xmath58 is the dynamical critical exponent ) and critical temperature @xmath59 .",
    "on that idea are actually based the investigations of the low - temperature effects in quantum systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) , i.e. one considers an _ effective system _ with @xmath12 infinite space and @xmath58 _ finite _ `` temperature '' ( `` imaginary - time '' ) dimensions @xmath60 with periodic boundary conditions , and applies the methods of the finite - size scaling theory ( in what follows we will set @xmath61 ) .",
    "an exact lattice realization of these ideas is presented in @xcite .",
    "since the generalizations of the zamolodchikov s @xmath6-theorem are formulated for quantum systems with @xmath62 in the remainder we will focus our attention on such class of systems only .",
    "for these systems netto and fradkin define @xcite the dimensionless function @xmath63 ,   \\label{cdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the zero - temperature energy , i.e. the energy of the `` infinite '' system , @xmath65 is the volume ( @xmath66 but @xmath67 is fixed , where @xmath68 is the number of particles ) , @xmath69 is a positive real quantity , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the full free energy of the `` finite '' system ( where the only `` finite '' dimension is the `` temperature '' one , i.e. the `` geometry '' of the system is @xmath72 ) and @xmath17 is the characteristic length scale of the lattice . the real positive quantity @xmath69 is supposed to be of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a positive real number ( which depends only on the dimensionality of the system ) and @xmath75 is the characteristic velocity ( e.g. the velocity of the quasiparticles ) in the system . obviously , the exact choice of @xmath74 does not effect the monotonicity properties of the @xmath6-function . in @xcite",
    "the definitions @xmath76 for bosons and @xmath77 for fermions have been proposed .    in accordance with the dimensional crossover rule the statement that @xmath6 is a positive and a monotonically increasing function of the temperature can be `` translated '' in a statement that the function @xmath78 of the corresponding classical system is positive and a monotonically increasing function of @xmath79 see eqs .",
    "( [ fexd ] ) and ( [ fss ] ) ( of course , the last is equivalent to a statement , that @xmath49 is a negative and a monotonically increasing function of @xmath19 ) . in @xcite , @xcite it is shown that the monotonicity of the @xmath6-function is related to the absence of long range order in the systems under consideration .",
    "the existence of long range order destroys the general validity of the monotonicity . within the classical systems no long - range order exists above their bulk critical point .",
    "so , we expect the statement formulated for @xmath49 to be generally valid above @xmath8 for any classical system . supposing that this is true and recalling that in the vicinity of @xmath8 @xmath49 is a function of the scaling variables @xmath80 and @xmath81 which both are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath82 we come to the conclusion that _  in the vicinity of its critical temperature _",

    "it is possible to present some arguments to support that _ the above statement can be extended to the region _ @xmath88 _  for _ @xmath33 _  systems _ in contrast with the ising - like systems .",
    "the reasoning for the difference in the expected behavior of the excess free energy in @xmath24 and ising - type models is closely related to the well know differences in the behavior of the correlation length @xmath89 in these models : in the ising model @xmath90 both below and above the bulk critical temperature , whereas in @xmath91 @xmath92 models below @xmath8 and in the absence of an external filed ( @xmath93 ) , due to the existence of soft modes in the system ( spin waves ) , @xmath94 is identically infinite . on that basis one",
    "expects that , away from @xmath95 @xmath96 will tend to zero exponentially fast in @xmath19 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) for the ising - type models , and , therefore , being of the order of @xmath97 around @xmath95 @xmath49 can not be a monotonic function of its scaling parameters in the vicinity of @xmath11 in @xmath91 @xmath92 models the finite size corrections should be essential not only in the vicinity but also below @xmath8 @xcite . in other words , we expect the monotonicity in the behavior of the correlation length in @xmath91 @xmath92 models around @xmath8 to be mirrored by a corresponding monotonic behavior of the excess free energy .",
    "if an external field is applied ( @xmath98 ) then @xmath99 and , of course , we expect that @xmath100 exponentially fast with @xmath19 again , similarly to the ising - like systems behavior .",
    "but , since @xmath101 for any fixed @xmath102 the last implies that @xmath49 will be a monotonically increasing function of the magnetic field in the under critical vicinity of @xmath103 too .",
    "the statements presented above , should be considered , of course , only as a _",
    "plausible hypothesis _ , which has to be checked in order to probe the region of its validity .",
    "for example , it is under question if the monotonicity property of @xmath49 will still hold if the finite system undergoes a phase transitions of its own .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that the hypothesis holds for any @xmath91 @xmath104 , system with @xmath14 ( then in the finite system with short range interaction there will be no `` real '' phase transition ) .    in the present article",
    "we will show , within the three - dimensional mean spherical model , that _ in the vicinity of _ @xmath8 _ the excess free energy scaling function _",

    "it is believed that if @xmath114 the casimir force will be negative ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; strictly speaking , for an ising - like system this is supposed to be true above the wetting transition temperature @xmath115 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the case of a fluid confined between identical walls",

    "we will also show that if @xmath118 and @xmath119 the casimir force is a monotonically increasing function of the temperature .",
    "we believe that these properties are valid for any @xmath120 models .    the full temperature dependence of the casimir force has been investigated exactly in two - dimensional ising strips by evans and stecki @xcite , whereas the upper critical temperature dependence of the force in @xmath24 systems has been considered by krech and dietrich @xcite by means of the field - theoretical renormalization group theory in @xmath121 dimensions .",

    "the most results available at the moment are for the casimir amplitudes @xmath122 . for two - dimensional systems at @xmath123 by using conformal - field theory methods the amplitudes are exactly known for a large class of two - dimensional models @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "for @xmath127 the only existing results are obtained by the @xmath128-expansion technique , where the calculations are performed up to the first order in @xmath129 @xcite .    in the present article the hypotheses for the monotonicity of the excess free energy and that the casimir force is negative under periodic boundary conditions will be verified analytically on the example of the three - dimensional mean spherical model .",
    "we will present also simple analytical results for the universal values of the casimir amplitude and the binder s cumulant ratio .",
    "if one takes the normalization factor of the analog of the @xmath6-function in the form for bosons ( this will keep the @xmath6-function of the critical gaussian model to be @xmath130 for any @xmath12 ) , it will be shown that the _ ",

    "the vast difference for the cumulant ratio indicates the lack of a real phase transition in the three dimensional spherical model film in comparison with the ising like films . actually , in three - dimensional ising films the situation is more complicated @xcite .",
    "if the thickness of the film @xmath19 is held constant and the other two linear dimensions @xmath243 tend to infinity , the cumulant ratio converges to the two - dimensional ising value ( @xmath241 @xmath244 ) .",
    "however , if the ratio @xmath245 is not too small , there exist crossover problems . in any case",
    "the value of @xmath3 is between that one for the two - dimensional system and that one for the three - dimensional system ( @xmath246 @xcite ) . the value of @xmath3 for the spherical model shows that the probability distribution at @xmath8 of the order parameter density is too different from a single gaussian , where @xmath247 or from a normalized sum of two gaussians , where @xmath248 this , of course , rises the question what then that distribution is , but this question is out of the scope of the current article .",
    "the situation reminds the one of ising strips ( no real phase transition in the system ) with @xmath249 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the crossover problems in binder s cumulant ratio can be studied within the spherical model , considering a @xmath250 dimensional film , @xmath251 ( then in the finite system there will be a real phase transition ) .",
    "this is also an interesting problem , especially if one takes into account that there are almost no exact results for the binder s cumulant ratio , but it is again out of the scope of the current article .",
    "the results reported in the current investigation are in full agreement with the predictions of the finite - size scaling theory .",
    "eqs.([xecff ] ) , ( [ eqff ] ) , ( [ eqif ] ) , ( [ fcas ] ) and ( [ xsf ] ) give the _ universal _ finite - size scaling function of the excess free energy , casimir force and free energy density",
    ". it should be , however , emphasized that in contrast to the ising - like case the excess free energy , and , therefore , the casimir force in the absence of an external field tend to zero below @xmath8 not in an exponential in @xmath19 way .",
    "for example , the finite - size scaling functions of the excess free energy and casimir force tend to a constant below @xmath8 ( see eq .",
    "( 31 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the explanation of this behavior , which , we believe , is common for all @xmath120 models , is based on the fact that due to the existence of soft modes in the system ( spin waves ) below @xmath8 and in the absence of an external field ( @xmath93 ) @xmath252 is identically infinite . if an external field is applied ( @xmath98 ) then @xmath253 , and , of course , @xmath254 again exponentially fast in @xmath19 .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning the close parallel that exists between the properties of the @xmath255function defined by netto and fradkin @xcite , see also zabzin @xcite , for a @xmath12-dimensional quantum system as a function of the temperature @xmath9 and the properties of the excess free energy scaling function @xmath78 of the corresponding classical system as a function of @xmath256 if in the finite system a real phase transition does not exist , and if the system is somehow equivalent to the @xmath257 system we have proposed some arguments that @xmath78 is a monotonically increasing as a function of @xmath258 above @xmath8 and decreasing below @xmath11 we would expect the same to be true for the @xmath6-function of the corresponding quantum system as a function of @xmath9 around its quantum critical point . if the classical system is equivalent to some ising type model , the same type of arguments we have used for the @xmath257 models , taking into account the lack of monotonicity of the correlation length in the vicinity of @xmath95 lead to the hypothesis that @xmath78 will be a monotonic function of @xmath258 both below and above @xmath11 for the corresponding @xmath6-function of a quantum system that has its mapping into a classical ising system ( according to the dimensional crossover rule ) this means that @xmath6 is a monotonically increasing function of the temperature both below and above its quantum critical point .",
    "this is indeed the case plotted in fig . 2 in @xcite for the quantum version of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "at the very end , we would like to stress that the relatively simple picture described here should probably change significantly , if the finite system undergoes a phase transition of its own . in that case",
    "the upper critical part of the excess free energy scaling function for @xmath259 ising model is known @xcite ( up to a first order in @xmath260 ) .",
    "it shows a _ minimum _ in @xmath261 as a function of @xmath9 _ slightly above _",
    "@xmath11 unfortunately , no results are available for @xmath49 when @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the shifted critical temperature of the finite system .",
    "it is possible to investigate the above problems exactly within the spherical model with @xmath264 infinite dimensions .",
    "we hope to return to this problem later .",
