    "we consider slemrod s model @xcite for a one - dimensional isentropic gas with capillarity @xmath0 where physically , @xmath1 is the specific volume , @xmath2 is the velocity in lagrangian coordinates , @xmath3 is the pressure law for an ideal gas , that is @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the coefficient , @xmath6 , accounting for capillarity strength , is constant .",
    "this is model is a generalization of the compressible isentropic navier - stokes equations , or the @xmath7-system with semi - parabolic ( or real ) viscosity , @xmath8 it has recently been shown that viscous shock wave solutions of are spectrally stable for all amplitudes in the case of an adiabatic gas law @xmath9 , @xmath10 $ ] ; see @xcite .",
    "we remark that this result , together with mascia & zumbrun s work @xcite implies that viscous shocks are asymptotically orbitally stable ( hereafter called nonlinearly stable ) . in this paper",
    ", we make the first step toward generalizing this work to slemrod s model by showing that monotone and mildly oscillatory smooth shock profiles of small to moderate amplitude are likewise spectrally stable .    more generally , we are interested in understanding the degree to which the analytic methods used to study shock wave stability in viscous conservation laws extend to viscous - dispersive systems .",
    "we view slemrod s model as an important test case as it is physically realistic and yet captures some of the essential mathematical hurdles found in more extensive models of compressible fluid flow .",
    "in particular , slemrod s model is symmetrizable and genuinely coupled , having only semi - parabolic diffusion ; see @xcite for details .",
    "a few notable results in the study of shock wave stability for viscous conservation laws include the works of kawashima @xcite , who proved that genuinely coupled symmetrizable systems has a stable essential spectrum , the works of goodman and others @xcite , who proved small - amplitude spectral stability for viscous shocks through the use of cleverly chosen weighted energy estimates , and the works of zumbrun and collaborators @xcite , who proved that spectral stability implies nonlinear stability for viscous shocks in conservation laws for both strictly parabolic and semi - parabolic viscosities .",
    "the missing piece in this overall program is to determine whether moderate- and large - amplitude viscous shocks are spectrally stable .",
    "very recently , however , spectral stability for large - amplitude shocks for was proven in the case of an adiabatic gas @xcite , and spectral stability was numerically demonstrated for the intermediate range through an extensive evans function study @xcite .",
    "there is some hope that this overall strategy will extend to more general systems of viscous conservation laws and perhaps even viscous - dispersive models .",
    "we remark that kawashima s admissibility results , mentioned above , were recently extended to viscous - dispersive ( and higher - order ) systems @xcite .",
    "also , howard & zumbrun showed that spectral stability implies nonlinear stability for scalar viscous - dispersive conservation laws @xcite .",
    "however , the remaining pieces of the general program for viscous - dispersive systems , described above , are still open .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ prelim ] , we set the stage by first proving the existence of shock profiles for through the use of a lyapunov function argument . then using geometric singular perturbation theory",
    ", we show that small - amplitude shock profiles converge to the zero - capillarity case and are thus monotone . following that",
    ", we use a qualitative ode argument to show that our profiles are monotone for weak capillarity yet become highly oscillatory as the capillarity strength @xmath11 increases .",
    "we then provide a short estimate on the derivative bounds of the profile , which are used later in the stability analysis .",
    "finally , we formulate the integrated eigenvalue problem , which makes the stability problem more amenable to analysis ; see for example @xcite . in section [ spec ] , we generalize the work of matsumura & nishihara @xcite and barker , humpherys , rudd , & zumbrun @xcite by using a spectral energy estimate to prove that small - amplitude monotone shocks of are spectrally stable . in section [ noreal ] , we further extend the results in @xcite and offer a short and novel proof that monotone shocks have no unstable real spectrum regardless of amplitude .",
    "this restricts the class of admissible bifurcations for monotone profiles to those of hopf - type , where one or more conjugate pairs of eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis .",
    "the approach used here is different than many energy methods in that we use a spectral energy estimate that does not appear to have a time - asymptotic equivalent , whereas most energy estimates can be performed in either domain . in section [ hfb ] , we extend the spectral bounds in @xcite to by proving that high - frequency instabilities can not occur for adiabatic monotone profiles of any amplitude for @xmath12 . finally in section [ evans ] ,",
    "we carry out a systematic numerical evans function study showing that adiabatic monotone and mildly oscillatory profiles are spectrally stable for moderate shock and capillarity strengths .",
    "we remark that highly oscillatory profiles in the scalar kdv - burgers model were shown by pego , smerka , & weinstein @xcite to be unstable in certain cases .",
    "thus for some , perhaps extreme , parameters , one can reasonably expect instabilities to occur in our system as well .",
    "it is challenging , however , with current technology to explore these extreme cases numerically .",
    "we plan on exploring this in the future .",
    "in this section , we derive the profile ode and provide a convenient scaling for our analysis .",
    "we prove the existence of shock profiles for through the use of a lyapunov function argument . then using geometric singular perturbation theory",
    ", we show that small - amplitude shock profiles converge to the zero - capillarity case and are thus monotone . through a qualitative ode argument",

    "we then provide a short estimate on the derivative bounds of the profile , which will be used later in the stability analysis .",
    "finally , we formulate the spectral stability problem and change to integrated coordinates making it more amenable to analysis ; see for example @xcite .      by a shock layer ( or shock profile ) of ,",
    "we mean a traveling wave solution @xmath14 with asymptotically constant end - states @xmath15 . rather by translating @xmath16",
    ", we can instead consider stationary solutions of @xmath17 under the rescaling @xmath18 , our system takes the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the shock profiles of are solutions of the ordinary differential equation @xmath21 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath22 .",
    "this simplifies to @xmath23 by integrating from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , we get our profile equation , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is found by setting @xmath28 , thus yielding the rankine - hugoniot condition @xmath29 without loss of generality , we will assume that @xmath30 .",
    "we remark that small - amplitude shocks occur when @xmath31 is close to @xmath32 and large - amplitude shocks arise to when @xmath31 nears zero .",
    "[ cap : rmk1 ] in the absence of capillarity , that is when @xmath33 , the profile equation is of first order , and thus has a monotone solution . as we will show , small values of @xmath11 likewise yield monotone profiles whereas large values of @xmath11 produce oscillatory profiles .",
    "we make this precise below .",
    "although much of the analysis in this paper holds for ideal gases , that is when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , our numerical study focuses on the special case of an adiabatic gas law , @xmath36 together with the rescaling @xmath37 where @xmath38 is chosen so that @xmath39 ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "this choice simplifies our analysis in section [ hfb ] and also gives the mach number @xmath40 the simplifying form @xmath41 .",
    "we prove existence of profiles by the following lyapunov function argument . by writing as a first order system , we get    [ firstorder ] @xmath42 , \\label{firstorder2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 the zero - diffusion case is conservative and has a corresponding hamiltonian that provides us with the needed lyapunov function",
    ". specifically , let @xmath44 since @xmath45 on @xmath46 , then @xmath47 is non - negative for @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 hence with diffusion , bounded ( homoclinic ) orbits at @xmath50 are pulled into the minimum @xmath51 of @xmath47 as @xmath52 .",
    "thus there exists a connecting orbit from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "we now show that small - amplitude shocks of are monotone and follow the same asymptotic limits as the @xmath33 case presented in @xcite .",
    "we accomplish this by rescaling and showing , via geometric singular perturbation theory @xcite , that the profile converges , in the small - amplitude shock limit , to the ( monotone ) non - dispersive case .",
    "thus , monotonicity of small - amplitude shocks of is implied by the monotonicity of the non - dispersive case , as mentioned above .",
    "small - amplitude shocks of are monotone for any fixed @xmath11 .",
    "we scale according to the amplitude @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "this frame is chosen so that the end - states of the profile are fixed at @xmath57 .",
    "additionally , we expand the pressure term @xmath3 and the viscosity term @xmath58 about @xmath59 . hence becomes @xmath60 by expanding the rankine - hugoniot equality , @xmath61 , about @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath62 substituting into and simplifying gives ( recall that @xmath63 ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "thus , in the @xmath66 limit , becomes @xmath67 which is essentially the same reduction obtained for the viscous burgers equation .",
    "note that the capillarity term vanishes as well , and thus the reduction is the same as the zero - capillarity @xmath68 case .",
    "the slow dynamics of take the form    [ jxslow ] @xmath69 .",

    "since there are no vertical branches , no jumps occur and thus it follows that small - amplitude shocks approach the solutions for .",
    "hence , for sufficiently small amplitudes , the profiles are monotone .    in the original scale , small - amplitude profiles of have the asymptotic properties @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the amplitude ; see @xcite . from the above argument",

    "the transition point between monotone and non - monotone profiles is found to be @xmath78 and in the case of an adiabatic gas with @xmath39 , see section [ adiabatic ] , this becomes @xmath79 where @xmath40 is the mach number .",
    "in particular as the amplitude approaches zero , we have that @xmath80 , see , thus making all profiles monotone regardless of @xmath11 ; this is consistent with the results in section [ smallamp ] .",
    "in the large - amplitude limit , we have that @xmath81 and thus @xmath82 .",
    "hence , for values of @xmath11 less than @xmath83 , all profiles are monotone , regardless of amplitude , and for @xmath84 a transition from monotone to non - monotone occurs for moderate to large amplitude fronts .",
    "we have the following :    shock profiles of are monotone iff @xmath85 .    by a geometric singular perturbation argument very similar to the one in section [ smallamp ] , we know that profiles are monotone for sufficiently small values of @xmath11 .",
    "when @xmath86 , we can show that the local behavior near the fixed point @xmath87 transitions from that of an unstable node to an unstable spiral , which is clearly non - monotone .",
    "hence , it suffices to show that the profile does not lose monotonicity until @xmath11 passes through @xmath13 . by linearizing about @xmath32",
    ", we get the system @xmath88 if monotonicity is lost before @xmath11 gets to @xmath13 , then for some @xmath89 the phase curve connects to @xmath32 vertically .",
    "this would require the vector field near @xmath32 to admit a vector in the @xmath90 direction .",

    "we show that @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the amplitude of the profile .",
    "this bound holds regardless of capillarity strength , and is important for our analysis in section [ hfb ] .",
    "the idea behind the proof follows from figure [ vx ] , where we see that the maximum value of @xmath96 occurs at the point where the profile intersects the zero - capillarity profile .",

    "we say that a shock profile of is spectrally stable if the linearized system has no spectra in the closed deleted right half - plane given by @xmath111 , that is , there are no growth or oscillatory modes . to show that the essential spectrum is stable",
    ", we linearize about the endstates @xmath112 and show that the resulting constant - coefficient system is stable ; see @xcite .",
    "this was done for general viscous - dispersive and higher - order systems in @xcite .",
    "thus it suffices to show that the point spectrum is also stable .",
    "however , since traveling wave profiles always have a zero - eigenvalue due to translational invariance , it is often difficult to get good uniform bounds in energy estimates .",
    "hence , we use the standard technique of transforming into integrated coordinates ; see @xcite .",
