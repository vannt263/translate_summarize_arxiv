    "there has been a growing interest in recent years in the theoretical and experimental study of the photonic crystals , 1- , 2- or 3-dimensional periodic structures that exhibit gaps for the propagation of electromagnetic waves ( emw ) in different frequency ranges .",
    "those gaps are similar to the bragg s reflection of the x - rays@xcite .",
    "the important difference between the two effects is that in the x - ray theory one can use high frequency expansion of the dielectric constant to consider the interaction of the emw with the media , while in the optical and microwave range this is impossible .",
    "the physical origin of the difficulties which may appear at low frequencies is the existence of other than emw degrees of freedom . in dielectric photonic crystals",
    "the polaritons might be important@xcite while in the metallic photonic crystals ( mpc ) these degrees of freedom are provided by free electrons .",
    "there are different ways of classification of the mpc .",
    "the first criterion is dimensionality , they may be 1-dimensional@xcite , 2-dimensional@xcite , and 3-dimensional@xcite .",
    "the second criterion is the connectivity .",
    "the mpc may consist of the separated metallic islands@xcite or it may include a connected metallic mesh@xcite .",
    "both cases are considered theoretically in the review@xcite .",
    "the third criterion reflects the frequency dispersion of the metallic conductivity .",
    "this dispersion is negledgible if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the frequency of emw and @xmath1 is a relaxation time of electrons in the metal . in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath0 , the dispersion of conductivity is very important , and the dielectric constant of the metal can be written in the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the plasma frequency of the metal , @xmath11 - three - dimensional electron density , @xmath12 is the effective mass of an electron .",
    "the low frequency case is considered in the majority of the works .",
    "some works , however ( see , say ref.@xcite ) , devoted to the high frequency case .",
    "one of the most perspective methods of fabrication of the mpc is the infiltrating various metals and semi - metals into the opals using high pressure@xcite . in our numerical estimates below",
    "we mostly keep in mind these materials .    in this work",
    "we consider a two dimensional mpc consisting of metallic circular cylinders in @xmath13 direction , embedded into a dielectric media with the dielectric constant @xmath14 .",
    "the axes of the cylinders form a square lattice in the @xmath15-@xmath16 plane .",
    "we assume a high frequency case so that dielectric constant of a metal is given by eq .",
    "( [ ep ] ) .",
    "the important applications of mpc are connected with the idea of creation a `` transparent metal '' , the material , which has a metallic type conductivity and at the same time is transparent at infrared or visible range .",
    "a regular bulk metal has the plasma frequency of the order of a few electron volts and it completely reflects light of the lower frequency .",
    "we show here that our system reminds a transparent metal even for the s - polarization ( electric field is in @xmath13 direction ) .",
    "it has a very narrow gap connected to a surface plasma wave and it is transparent at all other frequencies .    a similar system has been considered theoretically by kuzmiak et .",
    "they assumed that the wave vector of emw is perpendicular to the axes of the cylinders .",
    "their computations show that for s - polarization the system completely reflects emw with the frequency below @xmath17 , where @xmath3 is the volume fraction of the metal in the system .",
    "we confirm this result but we show that for the arbitrary angle of incidence the transparency is non zero at any low frequency .",
    "an important advantage of our method is that it is pure analytical .",
    "this gives us a deeper insight in the physics of the wave propagation , which is difficult for computational methods .",
    "our method based upon small parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath6 is the radius of the cylinders . for the case considered by kuzmiak et .",
    "al.@xcite our result for s - polarization can be obtained by a regular expansion of the system of equations derived in ref.@xcite with respect to parameters mentioned above .",
    "the main feature of our physical picture is a pretty complicated spectrum of the plasmons in the system , @xmath20 .",
    "now we consider a few limiting cases to get a qualitative idea about this function .",
    "generically this spectrum comes from the one dimensional plasmon .",
    "the spectrum of the one dimensional plasmon for one cylinder only has a form  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath6 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "this spectrum is almost linear and it starts from zero frequency .",
    "the electric field of the plasmon outside the cylinder decays exponentially as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the cylindrical coordinate .",
    "the physics is more sophisticated for a set of parallel cylinders which form a square lattice in the plane ( @xmath24 ) with a lattice constant @xmath25 .",
    "if the plasma wave is homogeneous in the ( @xmath24 ) plane so that @xmath26 , and @xmath27 then electrons in a given cylinder feel electric field of many other neighboring cylinders . then electrons in all cylinders vibrate with the same phase .",
    "such a mode is equivalent to a three dimensional plasma wave with a frequency @xmath28 . if @xmath29 there is no interaction between cylinders and one gets the one dimensional plasma wave .",
    "however its spectrum starts with the frequency @xmath28 and there are no modes with a lower frequency .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath30 , the phases of 1d plasmons in the neighboring cylinders are opposite , the electric fields created by all cylinders at a given one cancel each other . in this case",
    "the plasma waves in the system are still one dimensional and its spectrum starts with zero frequency .",
    "plasma wave with a frequency @xmath20 can be excited by emw which has a non zero @xmath31 component .",
    "this excitation is resonant if @xmath8 of the emw coincide with the corresponding value of plasma wave .",
    "note , that the bulk plasma wave can not be excited by emw because the first one is pure longitudinal while the latter is pure transverse .",
    "the plasma waves in our system are generated by electrons moving in the cylinders only , while the emw propagates everywhere outside and inside the cylinders .",
    "therefore in this case the emw does excite plasma modes .",
    "there is another plasma mode in our system , which can be excited by electric field with non zero component perpendicular to the cylinders .",
    "this is a surface plasma mode with a frequency @xmath32 .",
    "this mode also plays the important role in the propagation of emw .    in this paper",
    "we show that there are five different branches of the emw which cover all the frequency range with @xmath0 with one omnidirectional gap in the vicinity of the @xmath33 . except of this gap",
    "there is another gap at lower frequencies which is not omnidirectional and which depends on the polarization of the emw .",
    "the gap obtained by kuzmiak et .",
    "@xcite is a particular case of such gap at @xmath34 and @xmath35-polarization of emw .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ eigenfreq ]",
    "we derive the spectrum of the plasma waves in the system . in section [ secthree ]",
    "we study the dielectric properties of the system .",
    "they are described by the tensor of dielectric constants . in the principal axes ( @xmath36 ) two components of the tensor",
    "are equal to each other , namely @xmath37 and they depend on the frequency only .",
    "the longitudinal component @xmath38 is a function of @xmath8 and @xmath39 .",
    "the non - locality reflects the extra degrees of freedom and the long range coulomb interaction . to calculate @xmath40",
    "one should take into account deviation of acting field from average field . in section [ secfour ]",
    "we consider emw in the system .",
    "they may be classified as ordinary and extraordinary waves by analogy with the optics of uniaxial dielectric crystals .",
    "however since the dielectric tensor is a function of @xmath8 and @xmath41 we get two branches for the ordinary wave and three branches for the extraordinary one . in section [ secfive ]",
    "reflection and refraction of emw is considered . as in the case of optics of uniaxial crystals",
    "we obtain double refraction of emw .",
    "the two - dimensional model considered in this paper consists of infinite metallic cylinders of a circular cross - section .",
    "the cylinders are parallel to the @xmath13 axis and form a square lattice with the lattice constant @xmath25 .",
    "space between the cylinders is filled with a dielectric with the dielectric constant @xmath14 .    to calculate plasma waves one should assume that the three - dimensional electron density in the @xmath42 cylinder with coordinates @xmath43 has a modulation @xmath44 in this case electrostatic potential from the @xmath42 cylinder at a point with coordinates @xmath45 has a form    @xmath46    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 - modified bessel function of @xmath49-th order .",
    "the potential at the point @xmath45 created by the whole system of cylinders can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 since @xmath52 the term @xmath53 under the square root is important for @xmath54 only .",

    "fig .  [ dspboth ] shows complete spectrum of electromagnetic waves in the system , which includes both ordinary and extraordinary waves .",
    "one can see , that every frequency corresponds to two waves ( ordinary and extraordinary ) everywhere except the gap for the ordinary waves .",
    "thus , in a general case , one should expect a double refraction similar to a regular optics of dielectric crystals .",
    "our case is more difficult because of the @xmath8 and @xmath41 dependence of the dielectric constant .",
    "we mention first that tangential component of the wave vector of incident , reflected and refracted waves should be the same .",
    "this follows from the very general statement ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 304 ) that the spatial variation and time variation of the electric and magnetic field vectors must be the same at the boundary .",
    "suppose that the boundary is the plane @xmath138 and the plane of the incidence is ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "then one gets @xmath140 where symbols @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 label reflected , ordinary refracted , extraordinary refracted and incident wave respectively , @xmath145 is the angle of incidence .",
    "the solution of the problem of reflection and refraction in the case of @xmath41 dependent dielectric constant should consist of the following parts .",
    "the first part is to find @xmath146 and @xmath147 which determine angles of refraction of ordinary and extraordinary waves @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively . for the ordinary wave refraction angle",
    "can be found using the snell s law @xmath150 here and below we assume that incident and reflected waves propagate in the vacuum .    due to spatial dispersion of the @xmath40 calculation of the refraction angle for extraordinary wave",
    "is more complicated .",
    "one should find a solution for the frequency of the proper branch of the extraordinary wave in a form @xmath151 .",
    "this equation can be used to find @xmath147 at given @xmath152 and @xmath8 .",
    "the refraction angle for the extraordinary wave can be found using relation @xmath153 .",
    "the second part of the problem is to find electric field of reflected @xmath154 , ordinary refracted @xmath155 and extraordinary refracted @xmath156 waves . for this purpose",
    "we should first find two relations between three components of vector @xmath99 in each refracted wave from eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) .",
    "the other equations are the regular boundary condition on the surface including the continuity of the normal component of the displacement vector @xmath157 .    strictly speaking the last condition",
    "should be formulated in coordinate space rather than in @xmath41 space @xcite .",
    "however it works in @xmath41 space if @xmath158 . in general case",
    "one can use the continuity of the normal component of the poynting vector , calculated far from the boundary .",
    "the scheme described above is valid when the boundary plane forms any angle with the axis of cylinders in our system .",
    "note that if electric field in the incident wave is perpendicular to the cylinders , there is only ordinary refracted wave . in this",
    "case equations for all fields have a regular form ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , p. 305 ) .    as an example we consider a case when the boundary plane is perpendicular to the cylinders ( axis @xmath159 coincides with the @xmath13 axis ) and the plane of incidence includes @xmath13 axis and the diagonal of the square lattice formed by the axes of the cylinders in the plane @xmath160 .",

    "suppose that we have found @xmath163 for the extraordinary wave .",
    "note that in different frequency ranges @xmath164 is determined by different branches of extraordinary waves .",
    "then for electric fields of the reflected and refracted waves one gets @xmath165",

    "one can see that the system is basically transparent except for the small gap in the spectrum of emw in the vicinity of the surface plasmon .",
    "we have found that the two dimensional metallic mesh has two different plasma modes .",
    "one of them comes generically from one dimensional plasmon , which is produced by electrons moving along the thin metallic cylinder ( wire ) with both longitudinal and transverse electric fields outside the cylinder .",
    "it has a complicated dispersion law and its frequencies cover all the range from zero to the effective plasma frequency @xmath28 .",
    "such a plasma mode can be excited by s - polarized emw and it contributes to the longitudinal component of the dielectric tensor @xmath40 , which is a function of the wave vector @xmath41 , because the plasma frequency depends on @xmath41 .",
    "another important plasma mode is a surface mode with the frequency @xmath175 .",
    "this mode is almost independent of @xmath41 .",
    "it is excited by p - polarized emw and it contributes to the perpendicular component of the dielectric tensor @xmath105 , which is @xmath5-independent .",
    "these two plasma modes generate five different branches of the emw , which cover all the frequency range except very narrow omnidirectional gap in the vicinity of the frequency of the surface plasmon .",
    "the modes can be classified as two ordinary waves ( @xmath176 ) and three extraordinary waves ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "this classification comes from the uniaxial dielectric crystal , but the amount of modes in the metallic mesh is larger because the fresnel equation becomes non - linear due to the frequency and the spatial dispersions of the dielectric tensor .",
    "the theory of reflection and refraction of the emw in such a system becomes a special problem .",
    "we have described a general approach to this problem and solved it for the case of particular plane of incidence .",
    "the reflection coefficient has a maximum in the narrow frequency interval of the omnidirectional gap .",

    "<S> we calculate analytically the spectra of plasma waves and electromagnetic waves ( emw ) in metallic photonic crystal consisting of the parallel thin infinite metallic cylinders embedded in the dielectric media . </S>",
    "<S> the axes of metallic cylinders form a regular square lattice in a plane perpendicular to them . </S>",
    "<S> the metal inside the cylinders is assumed to be in the high frequency regime @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed analytical theory is based upon small parameters @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the volume fraction of the metal , and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the wave vector and @xmath6 is the radius of the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that there are five different branches of the emw that cover all frequency range under consideration except one very small omnidirectional gap in the vicinity of the frequency of the surface plasmon . however , at some directions of propagation and polarizations the gap may be much larger . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection and refraction of the emw is also considered . </S>",
    "<S> the general theory of refraction is proposed which is complicated by the spatial dispersion of the dielectric constant , and one particular geometry of the incident emw is considered . </S>"
