    "the heavy - ion physics branch has been renewed interest very recently .",
    "this ranges from the fusion probabilities @xcite to symmetry energy dependence at intermediate energies as well as fragmentation of colliding matter @xcite .",
    "one observable that has been used extensively for extracting information from heavy - ion collisions is the collective in - plane flow of various particles @xcite .",
    "apart from transverse in - plane flow , one has also proposed , e.g differential @xcite and elliptical flow @xcite etc . + in general , collective flow in heavy - ion collisions is affected by both the nuclear mean field potential and nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross - sections .",
    "one should also keep in the mind that reaction dynamics depends also on the incident energy as well as on the impact parameter of the reaction @xcite . at low incident energies , reaction dynamics",
    "is dominated by the attractive nuclear mean field potential which results in deflection to negative angle .",
    "worth mention , at these enegies the phenomenon fusion , and cluster radioactivity are dominated @xcite . with increasing incident energy ,",
    "repulsive nucleon - nucleon scattering becomes important and results in reduced negative flow caused by the attractive mean field potential . as a result , at a certain incident energy , called the balance energy , the in - plane flow vanishes as a result of cancellation between these two competing effects [ 10 - 14 ] .",
    "the composite dependence of the @xmath1 on the mean field and nucleon - nucleon cross - sections ( @xmath2 ) can be sorted out by noticing the sensitivity of @xmath1 on the system size , impact parameter as well as isospin degree of freedom of the reaction [ 6 - 10 ] .",
    "+ experimentally , balance energy is observed for different systems ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the very accurate measurement of the @xmath1 in @xmath4 @xcite has generated a renewed interest in the field .",
    "unfortunately , these studies have not provided any significant contribution of isospin effects towards the balance energy .",
    "later on , pak et al . @xcite demonstrated the isospin effect on the collective flow and balance energy at central and peripheral geometries .",
    "these findings were limited only for @xmath5 and @xmath6 systems .",
    "theoretically , the disappearance of directed flow is studied using the boltzmann uehling uehlenbeck ( buu ) model . @xcite and quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model [ 3 - 5,10 - 21 ] .",
    "different theoretical attempts considered either a stiff or soft equation of state along with a variety of nn cross - sections .",
    "very recently , puri and co - workers @xcite , conducted a very detailed analysis on the balance energy over entire periodic table with masses between 24 and 394 .",
    "these study shed light on various aspect of nuclear dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , this study along with all other studies reported in literature are limited to central / semi - central collisions only @xcite . following this work ,",
    "the detailed analysis on the the semi - central and peripheral collision is performed by the puri and co - workers in 2010 @xcite .",
    "all these studies indicated enhanced cross - section of 40 - 55 mb with stiff equation of state to verify the balance energy in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "all these studies were independent of isospin effects .",
    "the first study showing the isospin effects on the collective flow and balance energy was reported by li et al.@xcite using the isospin dependent boltzmann uehling uehlenbeck ( ibuu ) model , where strong dependence of isospin effects was observed . in another contribution @xcite , they suggested the demand of reduced isospin dependent cross - section(@xmath7 ) to better explain the experimental data .",
    "chen et al.@xcite studied the effect of isospin degree of freedom on the balance energy using isospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) model , which was an improved version of original qmd model @xcite .",
    "the calculated results were found to differ from the data at all colliding geometries .",
    "recently , gautam et al .",
    "@xcite also studied the isospin effect on the balance energy by using iqmd model @xcite , and also compared their findings with the other theoretical and experimental findings .",
    "they demanded to take care the gaussian width(l ) and cross - section ( @xmath7 ) , while studying the isospin effects in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "+ from the above , it is cleared that one is demanding an enhanced constant cross - section @xcite in qmd model . on the other hand",
    ", it is also observed that the reduced isospin dependent cross - section is valid for the soft as well as for soft momentum dependent equation of state @xcite within iqmd or ibuu model .",
    "the systematic concept of enhanced and reduced isospin dependent cross - sections in the presence of hard equation of state is missing throughout the literature .",
    "moreover , the effect of isospin dependent cross - sections are studied on the limited systems experimentally as well as theoretically @xcite .",
    "we plan to study the effect of enhanced ( 30 % of @xmath2 ) as well as reduced ( 30 % of @xmath2 ) isospin dependent cross - sections in the presence of hard equation of state on the systems for which the experimental finding energy is predicted in the literature and then will compare the results with experimental findings .",
    "for this study , we will employ isospin dependent quantum molecular dynamics(iqmd ) model which is discussed in sec .",

    "iii , followed by conclusion in sec .",
    "the isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamics ( iqmd ) @xcite model treats different charge states of nucleons , deltas and pions explicitly @xcite , as inherited from the vuu model @xcite .",
    "the iqmd model has been used successfully for the analysis of large number of observables from low to relativistic energies @xcite .",
    "the isospin degree of freedom enters into the calculations via symmetry potential , cross - sections and coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "the details about the elastic and inelastic cross - sections for proton - proton and neutron - neutron collisions can be found in ref .",
    "these cross - sections follow the data published by particle data group ( pdg ) for proton - neutron and proton - proton scattering @xcite . in this model ,",
    "baryons are represented by gaussian - shaped density distributions @xmath8 where l is the gaussian width . as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , in iqmd the value of gaussian width l depends on the size of the system .",
    "this system size dependence of l in iqmd has been introduced in order to obtain the maximum stability of the nucleonic density profile .",
    "therefore , in the present study , by checking the stability , we have taken the value from 0.5l to l. its earlier version qmd has been very successful in explaining the multifragmentation @xcite , temprature and density @xcite , flow @xcite , multifragments @xcite and particle production @xcite .",

    "meson potential consists of coulomb interactions only .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are adjusted to the real part of the nucleonic optical potential . for the density dependence of nucleon optical potential ,",
    "standard skyrme - type parametrization is employed .",
    "the choice of equation of state ( or compressibility ) is still controversial one .",
    "many studies advocate softer matter , whereas , much more believe the matter to be harder in nature @xcite . for the present analysis ,",
    "a hard ( h ) equation of state , has been employed along with standard energy dependent cross - sections .",

    "the time evolution of reaction is follow upto 200 fm / c .",
    "this is the time at which transverse in - plane flow saturates for lighter as well as for heavier systems . for this study , the reactions of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , l=0.5l ) where l=8.66 @xmath28",

    "( at @xmath51 ) for @xmath33 system .",
    "as the experimental balance energy for @xmath33 is in the range of 55 - 60 mev / nucleon , so one is expecting to follow the whole dynamics at @xmath51 .",

    "the results in the figure are displayed for five different systems and at reduced as well as enhanced isospin dependent cross - sections .",
    "the figures are indicating the similar scenerio with @xmath50 as is depicted with @xmath42 .",
    "below the balance energy ( in fig .",
    "3 ) , the directed in - plane flow is negative during the initial phase of reaction for all the systems under consideration .",
    "this becomes positive at sufficient high incident energy say e=200 mev / nucleon ( in fig .",
    "these results shows that interaction among nucleons are attractive during the initial phase of the reaction , which turns out to be repulsive with increase in the incident energy .",
    "these interactions remain either attractive or repulsive throughout the time evolution depends on the incident energy , isospin dependent cross - sections as well as composite mass of the system .",
    "it is clear from the figure that directed flow is becoming more positive or less negative with incident energy , isospin dependent cross - sections as well as with size of system .",
    "there is a sharp transition for each system from negative to positive directed flow at a particular cross - section .",
    "this particular transition is not possible for @xmath26 system indicates the requirement of other variable like momentum dependent interaction as well as enhancement in cross - section more then 30 % . if one compares the figs . 1 - 4",
    ", the same physics of balance energy elaborates with the @xmath42 as well as with @xmath50 .",
    "out of these , as discussed earlier , @xmath50 is the simple and more useful quantity , because it is summed over entire rapidity distribution , that is why , @xmath50 is elaborated in detail for the further study .",
    "+ to study the influence of reduced as well as enhanced cross - sections on directed flow @xmath50 or alternatively on the balance energy , in figs 5 and 6 , incident energy dependence of directed flow is displayed for different systems .",
    "the different lines in figure represent the variation with different cross - sections .",
    "the studies with enhanced and reduced cross - sections are also available in the literature @xcite .",
    "the experimental data are represented by stars .",
    "the directed flow goes from negative to positive value with increase in the incident energy .",
    "this is the general trend and is explained many times in the litrature by taking the concept of mean field and nn cross - sections . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of different cross - sections is consistent through the present mass range . by finding the evidence of reduced cross - sections from fig",
    "5 , the results are displayed between ( 0.7 - 0.9 @xmath2)values in fig .",
    "the enhanced cross - section ( 1.3 @xmath2 ) gives more positive value followed by the cugnon cross - section ( @xmath2 ) towards the reduced cross - section ( 0.7 @xmath2 ) .",
    "in other words , with increase in the cross - section value from ( 0.7@xmath2 - 1.3@xmath2 ) , the directed flow is becoming more positive or less negative .",
    "this is due to the reason that with increase in the cross - section value , probability of reaction to take place increases that further results increase in the nn collisions and hence more positive value of the directed flow .",
    "this is resulting decrease in the balance energy .",
    "the balance energy is also found to decrease with increase in the composite mass of the system .",
    "this is due to dominance of coulomb repulsion with an increase in the composite mass of system .",
    "except for some lighter systems , the cross - section @xmath51 is found to explain the experimental balance energy nicely .",
    "similar parametrization was also performed by sood et al .",
    "@xcite within qmd model .",
    "they also found that enhanced cross - section ( @xmath53 ) can best explain the data .",
    "in contrary , calculation in iqmd model demand reduced value of cross - sections .",
    "the difference is due to the additional effect of isospin dependent cross - sections in iqmd model @xcite , which were absent in qmd model .",
    "as in qmd model , the strength of nn , pp , pp cross - section is taken equal , while in iqmd , @xmath54 @xcite . due to the different strength of np , pp , nn cross - section in iqmd ,",
    "additional repulsion is produced compared to qmd model .",
    "this addition repulsion will force the directed flow to take earlier transition from negative to positive value and hence will lower the balance energy in iqmd model as compared to qmd for same cross - section value .",
    "that is why , the balance energy that was obtained with qmd at @xmath53 are at @xmath51 in iqmd model .",
    "this is first ever parametrization of balance energy with hard equation of state in the presence of reduced cross - sections with experimental available balance energy .",

    "can explain the data much better than any other theoretical calculations .",
    "the @xmath51 explains the data for all nuclei , except for some lighter nuclei .",

    "our calculations about the strength of reduced nn cross - section is in agreement with earlier calculation , where disappearance of transverse in - plane flow @xcite as well as elliptical flow is parametrized with experimental data @xcite .",
    "+ we have also tried to fit the balance energy in terms of other parameter such as the neutron to proton ratio of colliding nuclei .",

    "the @xmath61 value in this case is larger compared to the mass dependence .",

    "the balance energy is parametrized with n / z ratio in terms of power law , which is to be quite similar with the parametrization of composite mass of system , but the @xmath61 values are different in both of the cases .",

    "<S> the effect of different isospin - dependent cross - section on directed flow is studied for variety of systems(for which experimental balance energies are available ) using an isospin - dependent quantum molecular dynamic ( iqmd ) model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that balance energies are sensitive towards isospin - dependent cross - sections for light systems , while nearly no effect exist for heavier nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> a reduced cross - section @xmath0 with stiff equation of state is able to explain experimental balance energies in most of systems . </S>",
