    "dileptons with invariant mass below 1  gev have been measured in proton - nucleus @xcite and heavy ion collisions at the cern sps accelerator . for heavy ions ( laboratory energy 158  a  gev )",
    "a sizable enhancement of the order of a factor three has been observed over what is calculated from the @xmath4 decay of the hadrons in the final state .",
    "also the observed shape is very different from the calculated one .",
    "the data have not yet found an unambiguous explanation .",
    "most theories locate the origin for the observed dileptons in the hot and dense phase of hadrons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this phase is rather late in the time evolution of a heavy ion collision .    in this note , we take the opposite point of view and investigate the mass spectrum of the dileptons which arise from the very early stages of the heavy ion reaction in which partons are the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "we calculate ( i ) the direct production @xmath5 in the light cone approach and in a parton model and ( ii ) the lepton production via a gluonic compton process @xmath1 from prompt gluons which are radiated in preceding nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "these prompt gluons have been recently identified as as an important source for charmonium suppression in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this observation has triggered the present investigation .",
    "first we discuss the direct production of lepton pairs , which is already calculated using a parton model and perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "however , in the experiments under consideration , the invariant masses of the observed pairs are below 1  gev . in this domain pqcd may be questionable and we use a phenomenology based on the light cone approach which includes nonperturbative effects @xcite .    in the light cone",
    "approach , the drell - yan type process illustrated by one of the possible feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ figdiags]a is viewed in the target rest frame , where it looks like bremsstrahlung from a @xmath2 collision .",
    "the incident quark from @xmath6 scatters off a nucleon @xmath7 in the target and radiates a massive photon @xmath8 which then decays into a lepton pair .",
    "the cross section takes the form @xcite [ formula ] = d^2r_t|_^ * q(,r_t)|^2 _ q|q(r_t , s ) , where @xmath9 is the fraction of the light cone momentum of the quark carried away by the photon and @xmath10 is the transverse separation between the quark and the photon .",
    "@xmath11 is the light cone wave function for the transition @xmath12 .",
    "we give the explicit expressions for transverse ( @xmath13 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath14 ) photons |_^ * q(,r_t)|^2 & = & |^t_^ * q(,r_t)|^2 + |^l_^ * q(,r_t)|^2 , +     @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the quark mass and @xmath17 .",
    "note that although there is only a single quark in the initial state the cross section for radiation of a photon depends on the cross section @xmath18 for the scattering of a @xmath19 dipole off a proton .",
    "here , @xmath20 is the transverse separation of the dipole and @xmath21 is the _ c.m .",
    "_ energy of the quark nucleon system squared .",
    "this can be understood as follows @xcite .",
    "the physical quark is represented as a coherent superposition of different fock states . in our case , we take only the bare quark @xmath22 and the @xmath23 states into account . if these two fock states would scatter with the same amplitude off the target , coherence would be undisturbed and no radiation produced .",
    "the radiation amplitude is proportional to the difference between the scattering amplitudes of the two fock components .",
    "the dipole cross section enters , because of the interference between the two graphs in fig .",
    "the impact parameter of the projectile quark serves as center of gravity for the @xmath23 fluctuation .",
    "the difference in impact parameter between the parent quark and the quark in the fluctuation is @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the two graphs have a relative phase factor @xmath24 .",
    "the antiquark appears , when one takes the complex conjugate of one of the graphs .",
    "it is now easy to see , that in the absolute square of the two graphs , the color screening factor @xmath25 $ ] of @xmath18 emerges from the four different possible attachements of the two gluons .",
    "therefore the dipole cross section appears in , although there is no physical dipole in the system .",
    "perturbative qcd predicts @xmath26 for @xmath27 . indeed , a colorless @xmath19 dipole can interact only via its color dipole moment",
    "however , since we are interested in the low mass region , which corresponds to rather large separations @xmath10 , we rely on phenomenology and employ the modification @xcite of the saturation model of @xcite [ sigma ] _ q|q(r_t ,",

    "this cross section is proportional to @xmath31 for @xmath32 , but flattens off at large @xmath10 .",
    "the energy dependence correlates with @xmath10 . at small @xmath10",

    ", value and energy dependence of the total cross section for pion proton scattering is automatically reproduced .",
    "this cross section also allows to describe well the structure function @xmath35 in dis in a wide interval of energies and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the partonic cross section ( [ formula ] ) has to be embedded into the hadronic process .",
    "the cross section of direct dilepton production takes the form [ ds_d ] = _ q e_q^2",

    "the first term corresponds to radiation from the projectile quarks and the second term to radiation from the target quarks ( see fig  [ figdiags]a ) , which corresponds to replacement @xmath39 in the first term . since the dominant contribution to the cross section comes from large values of @xmath40 , we neglect antiquarks in the projectile , @xmath41 .",
    "we parameterize the valence quark distribution in the well known form f_u(x ) & = & ( 1-x)^3 , + f_d(x ) & = & ( 1-x)^4 , where @xmath42 are defined by the normalization to the number of valence quarks @xmath43 in a nucleon _ 0 ^ 1dx f_u , d(x ) = n_u , d . in the case of the proton - nucleus ( @xmath44 ) and nucleus - nucleus ( @xmath45 ) collisions",
    "the cross section of the direct production is given by the integration of the nuclear densities @xmath46 over the impact parameter [ ab_d ] = d d _",
    "-^ dz_b _ b(-,z_b ) = ab . in this expression",
    "we neglect small shadowing effects . to obtain the rate of the dilepton events per interaction one has to divide expression by the total cross section , which can be calculated using the glauber expressions _",

    "we employ the phenomenological expression ( [ sigma ] ) . *",
    "the light cone wave function @xmath49 depends on the mass @xmath16 of the quark . to illustrate its influence we calculate the cross sections for the two extreme cases of the constituent quark mass @xmath50  mev and @xmath51  mev .",
    "our results for proton ( p - be , p - au ) and heavy ion ( pb - au ) scattering are shown in figs .",
    "[ figbeau],[figpbau ] under the label `` light cone '' .",
    "the border lines of the shadowed areas correspond to different assumptions about the constituent mass @xmath16 ( @xmath52  mev and @xmath53  mev for the upper and lower lines , respectively ) .",
    "we believe , that also a different dipole cross section can not produce values , which are significantly out of the shaded area , because @xmath54 is well constrained to describe the structure function @xmath35 and hadronic cross sections .",
    "it is instructive to compare these results with predictions from a parton model which treats direct radiation of the lepton pair as compton scattering of a target gluon on a beam quark ( or _ vice versa _ ) .",
    "this way of description should be identical to one employed above ( as one can see from fig .",
    "[ figdiags ] ) .",
    "however , all phenomenological modifications introduced via the effective @xmath19 cross sections are missing . the subprocess @xmath55 is then calculated perturbatively with the help of the valence quark and gluon distributions in the proton .",
    "the main uncertainties in this case originate from :    * possible failure of pqcd calculations for the soft compton amplitude . *",
    "poor knowledge of the gluon distribution function , especially at a soft scale .",
    "we use the following gluon distribution function , [ fg ] f_g(x ) = ( 1-x)^5 , where @xmath56 is defined from the condition that gluons carry a half of the nucleon momentum _ 0 ^ 1dx x f_g(x ) = 12 .",
    "the pqcd calculation of the compton amplitude is similar to that for an interaction with on mass shell gluons presented in the next section .",
    "the results for proton ( p - be , p - au ) and heavy ion ( pb - au ) scattering are shown in figs .",
    "[ figbeau ] , [ figpbau ] . at low @xmath57",
    "the results of pqcd ( labeled as `` parton model '' ) are higher than those from the light cone calculations but start to agree for @xmath58  gev .",
    "the reason for this is that the saturation of the dipole cross section becomes important at small @xmath57 , and the cross section decays weaker than @xmath59 .",
    "although the parton model results are supposed to coincide with the predictions of the light - cone approach different approximations are used and the amount of disagreement between the results may serve as a measure of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that light cone prediction is more reliable .    the data in figs . 2 and 3 have been measured in a pseudorapidity interval of @xmath60 , while our calculations have been performed for rapidity @xmath61 .",
    "note that the data are also subject to @xmath62 cuts , which exclude very small transverse momenta , @xmath63 mev .",
    "these cuts are not included in our calculation . in the region of our interest ( @xmath64@xmath65  gev )",
    "however both approaches underestimate the experimental data by at least a factor of 10 .",
    "we therefore believe , that also a more careful calculation would not change our results .",
    "the second process , labeled `` prompt gluons '' , considers gluons which are radiated in an elementary @xmath2 collision and which convert into a virtual photon via gluonic compton scattering on another nucleon . to estimate their contribution to the dilepton pair production we start with the elementary compton subprocess @xmath66 ( see the upper part of fig .",
    "[ figdiags]b where the on - mass - shell gluon is marked by a dashed line ) .",
    "the invariant mass distribution for @xmath3 from this process can be expressed in terms of standard kinematic variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 as follows ( we use expressions from @xcite with substitutions , , ) [ dsq_mt ] = . if one neglects the transverse momenta of the initial particles , the cross section for the lepton pair production by the gluonic compton process on a quark takes the following form when going from the variable @xmath70 to rapidity @xmath37 ( for notations see fig.[figdiags]b ) [ dsq_my ] = 2 m , where ( y ) = m_q^2+m^2-(+m^2-m_q^2 ) .    to obtain the cross section for a nucleon one has to integrate expression over the quark distributions @xmath71 and mean number of gluons @xmath72 , which are radiated by quarks from a projectile nucleon in an interaction with a target nucleon . to calculate the prompt gluon spectrum we use the perturbative evaluation for the cross section of gluon radiation @xcite [ dsdadk ] = , where @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the factor of the dipole approximation for the cross section of a @xmath75 pair with a nucleon ( in this energy range @xmath76 @xcite ) and @xmath9 is the fraction of the quark light cone momentum carried by the gluon -4 mm [ alpha ] = . here",
