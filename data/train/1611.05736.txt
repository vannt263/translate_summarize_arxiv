    "a semiflexible polymer confined to a very narrow channel is almost perfectly extended and aligned with the channel axis .",

    "the conformational statistics depend on the interaction between hairpin segments . in this paper",
    "we consider self - avoiding polymers with the strength of the interaction parametrized by the polymer width , @xmath5 .",
    "the limit @xmath6 corresponds to an ideal polymer where self - avoidance does not matter . in this case",
    "the typical length of a hairpin defines a length scale @xmath7 , known as the global persistence length @xcite .",
    "if the contour length @xmath8 is much larger than @xmath7 then there are multiple hairpins in any channel segment , and the distribution of the extension approaches that of a one - dimensional random walk of @xmath9 steps of length @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "figs / fig1a.pdf    what happens when @xmath5 is not zero ?",
    "the importance of the parameter @xmath5 is quantified by odijk s scaling parameter @xmath11 where the channel height @xmath12 is assumed to be smaller than the channel width , @xmath13 .",
    "this parameter measures the expected number of overlapping points between the two strands of a hairpin of length @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the effect of self - avoidance depends on the magnitude of @xmath14 . if @xmath15 , hairpins are rarely observed , as it would be very difficult for the two strands of a hairpin to avoid overlapping with each other . as a result ,",
    "in this regime the configuration statistics are in approximate agreement with the predictions of the odijk regime @xcite .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath16 , then self - avoidance has a negligible effect on the likelihood of forming a hairpin . yet for a long polymer the effect on macroscopic observables such as the extension can be very significant .",
    "for example , while the average extension of a long ideal polymer ( @xmath17 grows as @xmath18 , for a self - avoiding polymer the scaling of the extension is always linear in @xmath8 in the limit @xmath19 , no matter how small @xmath20 .    the results summarized above apply provided that @xmath21 .",
    "however , since the global persistence length @xmath7 increases without bound when the channel size decreases @xcite , the inequality @xmath22 can be violated even for very long polymers .    in this article",
    "we therefore investigate the conformational statistics of a polymer with @xmath23 .",
    "we measure in simulations the equilibrium distribution of the extension and show that the shape of this distribution can be explained by a theory that relies on a series expansion .",
    "the simulation results are explained by keeping only the first two terms in this expansion , corresponding to conformations with no or one hairpin .",
    "this reflects the rarity of hairpins but their substantial impact nonetheless on the extension statistics .",
    "we compare simulations and theory against experiments using dna covered with the protein reca .",
    "the dna - reca complex is a polymer with a persistence length that is an order of magnitude larger than that of bare dna .",
    "this means that the polymer physics of interest can be visualized in much larger channels ( 600 nm3@xmath24 m ) where the resolution is not limited by light diffraction .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , it allows us to visualize the underlying configurations akin to previous experiments using fluorescent actin filaments @xcite .",
    "second , in the wider channels the extension of the confined molecules is dominated by hairpin configurations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hairpinsketch ] ) .",
    "we find good agreement between theory , simulations and experiments assuming that the persistence length of reca - coated dna is approximately @xmath25 m .",
    "we note that this value is considerably larger than most previous measurements reported in the literature .",
    "our experimental system also furnishes an opportunity for studying the dynamics of confined polymers . analyzing the subset of molecules which are free of hairpins",
    ", we find good qualitative agreement with existing theories for the dynamics in the odijk regime @xcite .",
    "since these theories have previously only been tested against bare dna , this is a powerful test of their general validity .",
    "we further discuss how the dynamics are affected by the emergence of hairpins .",
    "we show that the hairpin dynamics are stochastic .",
    "this behavior contrasts with previous work on unfolding of bare dna in channels @xcite , where the unfolding dynamics are captured by a deterministic model that balances friction with the deterministic entropic force arising from excluded volume @xcite .",
    "our equilibrium simulations use a discretized wormlike chain model @xcite .",
    "the discretization is made using a touching - bead model , with @xmath26 beads of diameter @xmath5 connected by rigid bonds .",
    "a bending potential determines the stiffness of the chain : @xmath27 the index @xmath28 ranges over bonds , @xmath29 is the angle between bonds @xmath28 and @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is known as the ` bending constant ' .",
    "the persistence length in this model is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the tangent vector to the chain at bond @xmath28 , and the average should be computed for an ideal and unconfined chain .",
    "the persistence length can be expressed in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath34 the channel extends in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "excluded volume interactions are incorporated into the model by imposing an infinite energy barrier for bead - bead overlap and bead - wall overlap .",
    "we simulate this model using the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite , following the approach described in our previous work in this area @xcite .",
    "perm is a biased chain growth method that provides , _ inter alia _",
    ", information on the extension statistics while avoiding the attrition problem in self - avoiding random walks .",
    "the perm simulations were conducted to grow chains up to 1501 beads using the parameters appearing in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "distributions of the mean span were obtained from @xmath36 tours , corresponding to @xmath37 configurations .    in previous work , we generally computed expectation values on - the - fly during the chain growth . in the present contribution , we modified our program to compute histograms for the probability @xmath38 of observing a particular value of the extension @xmath39 .",
    "we also added functionality that outputs configurations and their corresponding statistical weights for post - processing .",
    "the configuration of a polymer chain allows us to calculate the hairpin contour lengths as a post - processing step . for the latter analysis",
    ", we consider a moving window of 50 beads and compute the span and end - to - end distance for the subchain corresponding to each window .",
    "if these two sizes are equal , then there is no hairpin within the window ; otherwise , the window is flagged as a hairpin .",
    "typically , a given hairpin will involve multiple contiguous windows , which are grouped into a single hairpin event by a clustering algorithm .",
    "within each cluster , we then identify the bead with the minimum value of @xmath40 and assign the hairpin location to that bead . if the algorithm identifies two or more hairpin strands , and we use the shortest strand length as @xmath41 provided that its span in the channel is larger than 1 @xmath0 m .",
    "we found that this binning and clustering method is necessary because the simulations have much higher spatial resolution ( equal to @xmath5 ) than the corresponding experiments ; a bead - by - bead analysis leads to many very small hairpins that do not correspond to the global hairpins that are relevant in experiments .    to determine the global persistence length , we follow an existing approach for rectangular channels @xcite which we describe in detail in the supplemental material .",

    "a simple description of the dynamics of the extension in the hairpin - free state is offered by comparing the system to a particle diffusing in a harmonic potential @xcite .",

    "<S> the model also provides excellent agreement with experimental data provided that we assume a persistence length of 2 @xmath0 m for the reca - dna filament . </S>"
