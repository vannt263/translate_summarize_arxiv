    "this procedure would involve several additional numerical integrations in each iteration of the fitting procedure and thus dramatically slow down the latter . in the following ,",

    "this parameterization yielded the best fit to the belle data @xcite in a comparative analysis using the monte - carlo event generator jetset / pythia .",

    "previous determinations of non - perturbative charmed - hadron ffs in the parton model of qcd @xcite were based on data from the @xmath7-boson resonance , so that the effects of finite quark and hadron masses were greatly suppressed and could safely be neglected .",
    "the advent of precise data from the @xmath11 factories offers us the opportunity to further constrain the charmed - hadron ffs and to test their scaling violations .",
    "however , this motivates the incorporation of quark and hadron mass effects , which are then likely to be no longer negligible , into the formalism .",
    "the gm variable - flavor - number scheme , which we previously advocated @xcite , provides a rigorous theoretical framework for this and is employed here for the first time to determine ffs of heavy hadrons .    specifically , we determined here new ffs for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 mesons through global fits to all available @xmath0 annihilation data , from belle @xcite , cleo @xcite , aleph @xcite , and opal @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the situation at the @xmath7-boson resonance , the @xmath80 distribution of the cross section for continuum production is appreciably distorted by the effects of electromagnetic isr , which we , therefore , took into account . for comparison",
    ", we also performed fits to individual data sets .",
    "we found that the global fits somewhat suffer from the fact that the belle and cleo data tend to drive the average @xmath80 value of the @xmath233 ffs to larger values , which leads to a worse description of the aleph and opal data .",
    "since the @xmath125 ffs are only indirectly constrained by the belle and cleo data , their form is only feebly affected by the inclusion of these data in the fits . in order to assess the significance of finite - mass effects",
    ", we repeated the fits in the zm variable - flavor - number scheme .",
    "as expected , the inclusion of finite - mass effects tends to improve the overall description of the data , by reducing the @xmath232 values achieved . specifically , hadron mass effects turned out to be more important than quark mass effects .",
