    "electronics based on the spin of the electron represents a new direction of development ( spintronics ) @xcite . in order to utilize this additional degree of freedom as an ( either classical or possibly quantum ) computational resource it is required to develop a controllable way of manipulating spins .",
    "one of the most promising mechanisms that can be used for this purpose is the spin - orbit interaction @xcite in semiconductor materials , which can be controlled by an external electric field @xcite . for semiconductor nanostructures , where the mean free path of the electron can be much larger than the size of the device",
    ", quantum mechanical interference can lead to a new class of spin - sensitive devices , such as quantum gates @xcite . on the other hand , even if a whole spintronic apparatus does not use the quantum mechanical nature of the electron for information processing , some parts of it still may rely on interference phenomena , similarly to the polarizing device discussed in this paper .",
    "quantum rings @xcite or loops @xcite ( i.e. , ring shaped objects where quantum mechanical interference plays an important role ) made of a semiconductor material , have been shown to have remarkable spin transformation properties nate97,nmt99,sky01,mpv04,knv04,fr04,fmbp05,zx05,id03,g02 .",
    "this is partially due to the geometry of these devices , as the incoming electrons are forced to split into two different spatial parts that interfere at the output , while the spin - sensitive interaction introduces an additional effect to be taken into account .",
    "consequences of the interplay between spatial interference and the so - called rashba - type @xcite spin - orbit interaction was recently observed in hgte nanorings , where an external magnetic field was also present @xcite .",
    "more generally , the spin degree of freedom in quantum interference @xcite can play a prominent role in the development of a spintronic network based on various spin - sensitive devices @xcite .",
    "let us recall that already bohr and mott pointed out @xcite , that in contrast to atoms , one can not spin - polarize electrons in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we consider here a three - terminal quantum ring , where electrons entering in a totally unpolarized spin state become polarized at the outputs with different spin directions .",
    "this device can be deemed in a certain sense a spintronic analogue of the stern - gerlach apparatus fkbp06 .",
    "a related polarizing effect was recently predicted in a y - shaped conductor which was a consequence of scattering on impurities @xcite .",
    "note that this is a very different physical mechanism from the coherent spin transfer to be discussed here .",
    "our model is based on an exact , analytic solution of the spin dependent transport problem and thus provides a clear physical picture of a process where fundamental polarization effects as well as nontrivial spatial - spin correlations , entanglement or intertwining note1 appear @xcite .",
    "in addition , our treatment allows us to determine the parameter values for which the device is reflectionless , i.e. perfect polarization at the outputs takes place without losses .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that the physical origin of the polarizing effect we found earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite is essentially spatial interference : at a certain output junction the spatial parts of one of the eigenspinors representing clockwise and anticlockwise directed currents interfere destructively , leading to the transmission of the other orthogonal eigenspinor in the output lead .",
    "this effect is visualized by plotting the spatial dependence of the spin direction along the ring .",
    "we show that there are several , not necessarily symmetric positions where such destructive interference takes place .",
    "all of these configurations possess the polarizing property .",
    "we also determine the conditions for the spin polarization effect in terms of the aharonov - casher phases @xcite gained by the two orthogonal eigenspinors .",
    "the one - dimensional hamiltonian of an electron moving on a ring situated in the @xmath0 plane in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction is given by@xcite@xmath1 ,   \\label{ham}\\]]where @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle of a point on the ring , @xmath3 is the dimensionless kinetic energy of the electron , @xmath4 is the radius of the ring , @xmath5 denotes the effective mass of the electron , and @xmath6 is the frequency associated with the spin - orbit interaction , with @xmath7  being a static electric field perpendicular to the surface of the ring .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 can be tuned with an external gate voltage @xcite . apart from constants , this hamiltonian ( [ ham ] )",
    "is the square of the sum of the @xmath9 component of the orbital angular momentum operator @xmath10 , and of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radial component of the spin ( both measured in units of @xmath13 .",

    "the spin - sensitivity of the problem leads to a symmetry @xcite of the stationary solution that is more complex than the pure geometrical mirror transformation . note that without spin - orbit interaction destructive interference for a given spin direction would imply that the orthogonal spin component of the wave function is also zero at that point .",
    "consequently placing the output junctions in such positions would mean zero transmission probability .",
