    "all of these solutions are strictly equivalent , as are the different points on the @xmath3 vacuum manifold .",
    "this type of kink is important for understanding the structure of dense matter in the isonjl@xmath6 model in the following section , as it can be regarded as the low density limit of baryonic matter .",
