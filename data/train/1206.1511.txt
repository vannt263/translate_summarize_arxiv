    "<S> the primordial universe can be used as a laboratory to set constraints on quantum gravity . in the framework of loop quantum cosmology , </S>",
    "<S> we show that such a proposal for quantum gravity not only solves for the big bang singularity issu but also naturally generates inflation . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to a quantitative computation of the amount of gravity waves produced in the loopy early universe , we show that future cosmological datas on the polarized anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background can be used to probe lqc model of the universe .    [ </S>",
    "<S> [ methodological - introduction ] ] methodological introduction + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    building a quantum theory of gravity is probably the most outstanding problem of modern physics , but remains also one of the most difficult task . </S>",
    "<S> facing such a great challenge and retrospectively , looking at the many attempts developped since the last decades one could be tempted to consider that searching for quantum gravity is a never ending quest and that the wise attitude would be to withdraw such a challenge . </S>",
    "<S> however , quantum gravity is not _ optional _ ! </S>",
    "<S> several heuristic arguments pin down the necessity of a successful building of quantum gravity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , the singularity theorems derived by penrose and hawking @xcite shows that general relativity ontologically fails : a way out reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity is mandatory !    a new physical paradigm is needed and , to be successful , such a potentially new paradigm requires a well - established theoretical framework . on the one hand </S>",
    "<S> , this assumes a well - posed theoretical problem namely how to quantize general relativity or , alternatively , how to gravitize quantum field theory ? </S>",
    "<S> many tentative theories have been proposed such as string theory @xcite and loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite to mention the most popular ones , and though some of them have made great progresses , none of them is fully setted up . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> this also implies a new kind of paradigmatic experiments or observations . </S>",
    "<S> this is a mandatory step to discriminate theoretical proposals which are deeply on the wrong track from those which are not , as well as to guide theoretical developments . </S>",
    "<S> this well - posed phenomenological and experimental problem is the second main difficulty of quantum gravity as quantum gravitational effects should pop up at an energy scale of @xmath0  gev , far beyond any high energy physics experiments . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the failure of general relativity precisely points towards those phenomena potentially probing quantum gravity : space - time singularities provide the territory for quantum gravity and one therefore has to search for those phenomena built up of singular space - times . </S>",
    "<S> this qualifies the primordial universe , being the neighborhood of the big bang singularity , as an ideal territory for probing quantum gravity !    observing quantum gravity </S>",
    "<S> is therefore splitted into two questions . </S>",
    "<S> how a given proposal for quantum gravity affects the physics of the primordial universe _ and _ how can we probe the physics of the primordial universe ? </S>",
    "<S> apparently , the second question points towards observation . </S>",
    "<S> but , as a theoretical question , this should not be overlooked since it strongly determined the precise implementation of the first question the main requirement for a quantum gravity proposal is to solve for the pathological big bang singularities and this can be checked by computing the global evolution of the universe in a quantum cosmological setting . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be stressed out that such a global evolution can not be probed directly as one can not extract himself from the universe to see how it evolves in its primary ages . </S>",
    "<S> we are stuck inside the universe and , from the inside , we are able to probe the physics of the early universe via the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of such anisotropies are _ cosmological perturbations _ produced during a phase of accelerated expansion dubbed _ </S>",
    "<S> cosmic inflation_. inflation is a key ingredient of the standard cosmological paradigm as it solves for the horizon and flatness problems and provides a mechanism for generating perturbations , the primordial seeds for galaxies and large scale structures formation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , inflation could be a high energetic phenomenon ( its energy scale could be as high as @xmath1  gev ) and is therefore potentially affected by quantum gravity . nevertheless , the inflationnary scenario is not free of any problems as it is very difficult to generate such a phase without invoking speculative physics or fine tuning .    </S>",
    "<S> bridging a link between loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) the cosmological implementation of lqg @xcite and inflation in the early universe allows us to solve for the big bang singularity _ and _ to naturally trig a phase of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a quantitative computation of cosmological perturbations produced in such a _ loopy _ universe makes the early universe a potential laboratory for testing quantum gravity . our methodology is the following . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the universe is derived in the framework of _ effective _ lqc which includes first order quantum corrections coming from holonomies . on top of that modified cosmological background </S>",
    "<S> , we will quantitatively compute the amount of cosmological perturbations of tensor type ( _ i.e. _ primordial gravity waves ) and investigate how it impacts on the @xmath2-mode angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> such an angular power spectrum is the main observable and can finally be used to forecast how future cmb observations could be used to probe lqc . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the early universe to be filled with a massive scalar field @xmath3 as matter sources and our time variable is cosmic time @xmath4 .    [ [ background - evolution ] ] background evolution + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    with holonomy corrections at first order , the modifed friedman and klein - gordon equations are ( denoting @xmath5 the hubble parameter and @xmath6 the mass of the scalar field ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a critical energy density which can not be overcomed and which encodes lqc corrections . because of @xmath9 , the universe is not singular as the big bang is now replaced by a big bounce . </S>",
    "<S> the basical history of the universe is thus a contracting phase , followed by an expanding phase . </S>",
    "<S> the _ regular _ </S>",
    "<S> transition from the contracting phase to the expanding one is ensured by the quantum corrections and the bounce occurs at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , this peculiar evolution of the universe naturally leads to inflation ! indeed , a phase of accelerated expansion can start right after the bounce if the scalar field is in the appropriate energy state for the slow - roll conditions to be fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> for a massive field , this is translated into @xmath11 with @xmath12 denoting some time _ </S>",
    "<S> after _ the bounce </S>",
    "<S> . this condition is not easily met in the standard cosmological scenario . </S>",
    "<S> but in the lqc bouncing universe , the hubble parameter @xmath13 is negative valued during contraction . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore acts as an _ anti - friction _ term making @xmath3 to climb up its potential . </S>",
    "<S> right after the bounce , it appears that such a field is precisely in the appropriate energy setting for a sufficiently long phase of inflation to start @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key point about this scenario has been raised by ashtekar and sloan who showed that generating a phase of inflation in the lqc universe with the mandatory amount of at least 60 e - folds is very close to unity , making inflation rather natural in this framework @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ cmb - power - spectra ] ] cmb power spectra + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to derive the amount of gravity waves produced at the end of inflation , one needs to solve the following equation describing tensor perturbations evolving on top of the modified flrw background : @xmath14 where the last term , acting as a time - dependant mass term , encodes the quantum deformation of the background . </S>",
    "<S> this equation of motion @xcite has been derived from an algebra which is anomaly - free at all orders and can be safely used throughout the entire history of the bouncing universe . </S>",
    "<S> the main characteristics of a bouncy power spectrum for tensor modes are the following . </S>",
    "<S> the ir ( large scales ) part is @xmath15 suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the freezing of very large - scale modes in the minkowski vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> those modes indeed exit the horizon long _ before _ the bounce and naturally exhibit a quadratic spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the uv part is identical to the standard prediction . </S>",
    "<S> small scales indeed experience a history basically similar to that of the big bang scenario . </S>",
    "<S> they exit the horizon during inflation and reenter later , leading to the standard nearly scale - invariant spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate scales , around @xmath16 , exhibit both a bump of amplitude @xmath17 and damped oscillations shape to its nearly scale - invariant shape ) is a phenomenological parameter related to @xmath6 and to the fraction of potential energy at the time of the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , @xmath17 is a phenomenological parameter related to @xmath6 ( see @xcite for further details ) . ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is mostly due to the fact that all modes are inevitably in causal contact at the bounce ( the hubble parameter vanishes , therefore leading to an infinite hubble radius ) . </S>",
    "<S> those characteristics have been fully determined by numerically solving the equations of motion of tensor perturbations propagating in the lqc - corrected , \\{bouncing+inflationary } universe @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2-mode angular power spectrum ( left panel ) and detectable region of the parameters @xmath18 describing a loopy universe ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure adapted from @xcite . ]    using a boltzmann code , such a primordial tensor power spectrum serves as an input for computing the footprints of primordial gravity waves on the cmb @xmath2-mode angular power spectrum ( see left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] ) . as compared to the standard prediction </S>",
    "<S> , the distortion of lqc @xmath2-mode power spectrum depends on the value of @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( roughly speaking , the suppression of power at large scales can be seen in the cmb only for values of @xmath19 corresponding to scales _ smaller _ than the hubble horizon today . ) </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath20 corresponding to a length scale greater than the hubble scale today , the tail of the bump for @xmath21 translates into a slight bump at large angular scales ( _ i.e. _ small values of the multipole @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , for @xmath23 , the @xmath2-mode angular spectrum shows , as compared to the standard prediction , a suppression at large angular scales due to the suppression at large length scales in the primordial spectrum and a bump at intermediate angular scales @xmath24 . finally , if @xmath19 is greater than @xmath25 mpc@xmath26 , the suppression is effective up to @xmath22-values of a few hundreds and the primordial part of the @xmath2-mode is therefore systematically pushed below the lensing - induced @xmath2-mode .    using those angular power spectra as an observational probe and considering both the instrumental noise as expected for a future dedicated @xmath2-mode experimentk - arcmin . , the beam width to 8 arcmin . and the sky fraction to 70% . ] and the lensing - induced @xmath2-mode as a foreground masking the detection of primordial @xmath2-mode </S>",
    "<S> , one can forecast some constraints to be set on the fundamental parameters describing the lqc model of the universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detectable values at 1-@xmath27 of the mass of the scalar field @xmath6 and its fraction of potential energy at the bounce , denoted @xmath28 , are depicted by the blue band in the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] . </S>",
    "<S> this roughly corresponds to a detectable range of @xmath19 from @xmath29  mpc@xmath26 to @xmath30  mpc@xmath26 considering _ degeneracies _ with other cosmological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the upper part is not detectable as it corresponds to @xmath31 making the @xmath2-mode power spectrum _ undistorted _ as compared to the standard general relativistic prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the lower part is not detectable as it corresponds to @xmath32 making the primordial @xmath2-mode systematically smaller than the lensing - induced part . </S>",
    "<S> though measurements of the lqc parameters is not possible in this second case , a discrimination with pure general relativity is still possible as the suppression induced by the bounce is seen via the masking of the primordial @xmath2-mode . </S>",
    "<S> however in the precise case of lqc , the three parameters @xmath33 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 are fully determined by the _ two _ parameters @xmath6 and @xmath28 , thus breaking the degeneracy between @xmath19 and @xmath33 ( see @xcite for details ) . ] ; that is via its _ non - detection_.    [ [ conclusion ] ] conclusion + + + + + + + + + + +    lqg offers an appealing approach to build a quantum theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> its implementation to the symmetry reduced case of flrw metric describing our whole universe shows that the big bang singularity is cured and that inflation is _ naturally _ triggered . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , thanks to a quantitative computation of gravity waves produced in the early universe , subsequently impacting on the cmb polarized anisotropies of @xmath2-type , a possible window to constraint those loopy models of the universe using cosmological datas is now opened . </S>",
    "<S> as stressed out in @xcite , the case of lqc illustrates a possible future way to test for quantum gravity using cosmological / astronomical observations .    </S>",
    "<S> the author warmly thanks his collaborators aurlien barrau , thomas cailleteau and jakub mielczarek . </S>"
