    "the gw methodology @xcite has been successfully applied to the study of the quasiparticle properties of a wide range of systems @xcite from traditional bulk semiconductors , insulators and metals to nanosystems like polymers , nanotubes and molecules @xcite .",
    "the approach yields quantitatively accurate quasiparticle band gaps and dispersion relations from first - principles .",
    "a perceived drawback of the gw methodology is its computational cost ; usually thought to be an order of magnitude more than a typical dft calculation .",
    "one of the main computational bottlenecks of the traditional _ ab intio _ gw method @xcite is the cost to generate the large number of empty orbitals needed to converge the coulomb - hole summation term of the self - energy .    within the conventional gw approach , the quasiparticle energies and wavefunctions ( _ i.e. _ , the one - particle excitations ) are computed by solving the following dyson equation @xcite ( in atomic units ) : @xmath0 \\psi_{n\\bf k}^{\\text{qp}}=e_{n\\bf k}^{\\rm qp}\\psi_{n\\bf k}^{\\text{qp}}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the non - local , energy - dependent , self - energy operator within the gw approximation , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the quasiparticle energies and wavefunctions , respectively . in the typical gw approach , density functional theory ( dft ) within the kohn - sham approximation @xcite is often chosen as the starting point for a subsequent calculation of the electron self - energy : the kohn - sham @xcite wavefunctions and eigenvalues are used here as a first guess for their quasiparticle counterparts . in principle , eq .",
    "[ dyson_equation ] is a matrix equation , where @xmath1 should be constructred in an appropriate basis . in many cases ,",
    "only the diagonal elements are sizable within the basis spanned by the kohn - sham mean - field orbitals .",
    "we assume this to be the case for the rest of the paper .",
    "the effects of @xmath1 can thus be treated within first - order perturbation theory in the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the independent - particle mean - field approximation to the exchange - correlation potential of kohn - sham system @xcite .    within the gw approximation ,",
    "the self - energy operator is expressed as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electronic green s function and @xmath8 is the dynamically screened coulomb interaction . in the gw and static - cohsex ( the static limit of gw ) approximations for the self energy , the self - energy operator , @xmath1",
    ", can be broken into two parts , @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the screened - exchange operator and @xmath11 is the coulomb - hole operator .",
    "the screened - exchange operator is similar to the fock operator in hartree - fock theory , except the bare coulomb interaction is replaced by the screened coulomb interaction : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constructed in a non - self - consistent way from the dft orbitals and eigenvalues , the @xmath14 approach is referred to as being within the @xmath15 approximation . in this article , all results are presented within this approximation .    in a conventional gw calculation within the generalized plasmon - pole approximation @xcite , both the calculation of the coulomb - hole self energy term :    @xmath16 } \\;v{\\left({\\bf q}{+}{\\bf g}'\\right ) } \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the calculation of the dielectric screening matrix , @xmath17 , at @xmath18 : @xmath19 involve a summation over empty orbitals . here @xmath20 is the number of empty orbitals in the truncated sum , @xmath21 is a bloch orbital with a given crystal momentum @xmath22 , band index @xmath23 and energy @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the bare coulomb interaction in reciprocal space and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are plasmon - pole parameters @xcite .",
    "there has been much research effort invested in recent years to reduce the need for empty orbitals in the gw formalism @xcite .",
    "the approaches by umari et .",
    "@xcite and giustino et .",
    "@xcite eliminate the need for empty states entirely by constructing the dielectric response and self - energy from only occupied states within a linear - response sternheimer equation appraoch @xcite .",
    "while these approaches eliminate the need for empty orbitals , they are conceptually more complicated as well as more complicated to implement and optimize .",
    "it is therefore still of great value to address the computational cost of the empty orbital generation within the traditional gw approach laid out above .",
    "one approach to addressing the problem of the cost associated with empty orbitals in the traditional gw approach is to approximate the true dft empty orbitals with approximate orbitals that are computationally cheaper to generate @xcite . in the recent work of samsonidze et .",
    "@xcite , the authors proposed replacing the expensive step of constructing the exact kohn - sham empty states from a traditional dft package with a computationally inexpensive process of constructing the empty states from a reduced basis set consisting of plane - waves and resonant orbitals ( generated in siesta @xcite ) orthogonalized to the real occupied kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "while it was shown that this approach vastly reduces the cost of generating the required empty orbitals , the approach adds significantly to the complication of the gw process .",
    "in particular , one now must run a traditional plane wave dft calculation , a local orbital dft calculation and a post - processing orthogonalization step in order to generate the required electron orbitals needed to proceed to the gw calculation .",
    "additionally , the explicit sums in eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] and [ chi ] must still be performed over these orbitals .",
    "another approach to the empty state problem was proposed by tiago et .",
    "@xcite : a truncation of the sum over empty orbitals in eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] can be achieved with minimal loss of accuracy by adding the contribution of the remaining orbitals within the static ( cohsex ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the idea relies on the fact that , in static - cohsex , unlike gw , the coulomb - hole energy can be written in a simple closed form ( see next section ) as well as in a sum over empty - states , as the static limit of eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] .",
    "it was proposed that one may approximate the missing coulomb - hole contribution when truncating the sum after @xmath20 ( i.e. the contribution to the sum from the empty orbitals with index between @xmath20 and @xmath28 ) in a gw calculation by their contribution to the coulomb - hole energy in a static - cohsex calculation .",
    "this static approximation , however , was shown to be of limited use by bruneval et .",
    "@xcite , where , instead of using the static approximation for the remaining part of the coulomb - hole sum , the authors proposed using an approach based on a common non - zero energy denominator in eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] . if a constant denominator is assumed , than one may use the completion relation : @xmath29 to replace the sum over the missing empty orbitals with a sum over the available orbitals . in order to apply this directly to eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] and eq .",
    "[ chi ] , one must replace the @xmath23 dependent denominator with a constant .",
    "the main drawback of this common energy denominator approximation ( ceda ) approach ( known also as the extrapolar method ) is that the energy denominator is not uniquely defined and can only be treated as a somewhat ad - hoc parameter , and the quasiparticle energy convergence is not monotonic with this parameter .",
    "recent studies by kang and hybertsen @xcite have shown that a modified static cohsex approach can be used to accurately minimize the empty orbitals problem in the coulomb - hole summation of eq [ ch - sum ] . in that work ,",
    "the authors propose completely replacing the gw coulomb - hole operator with a closed - form static operator ( similar to that used by tiago @xcite ) with a @xmath30 dependent coefficient , @xmath31 , fit to match the gw result .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being completely closed form , but can be improved if one relaxes the requirement that the modified operator is used to replace the true gw contributions not only from high energy empty orbitals but also from valence and low energy conduction orbitals .    in this article",
    ", we propose a modified static remainder approach based on tiago s results @xcite that is more fully justified by the recent kang - hybertsen result @xcite .",
    "the new approach yields accurate gw coulomb - hole absolute energies ( to within 100 mev ) with less than 10% of the traditionally necessary empty orbitals .",
    "furthermore , unlike the extrapolar method of bruneval @xcite , this approach yields an easy to implement procedure with no adjustable parameters . for simplicity of presentation",
    ", we shall discuss our approach within the generalized plasmon pole model for the dielectric matrix .",
    "this approach can be straightfowardly applied to any existing gw computational package .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the band convergence of absolute energy levels in @xmath32 with the number of empty orbitals is extremely slow . in principle",
    ", one must converge a gw calculation with respect to the number of empty stats in both eq .",
    "[ chi ] and [ ch - sum ] .",
    "however , for many systems , the quasiparticle energy dependence on the number of empty orbitals in the dielectric screening ( e.g. eq . [ chi ] ) converges much faster than with the number of empty orbitals in eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] .",
    "for example , recent calculations for zno show that the coulomb - hole contribution to the electronic band gap does not converge until 3,000 + empty orbitals are included in the summation in eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we demonstrate the slow convergence of eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] in zno .",

    "@xcite , the authors propose using a modified static - cohsex operator that mimics the gw operator to entirely remove the need for empty orbitals . in our current approach , we include the full gw contribution from the low energy orbitals and add a single correction for the high - energy orbitals , where the static approximation is expected to perform well .",
    "one advantage of the present approach is that it can be used in conjunction with a full - frequency ( as opposed to gpp model ) screening approach to both calculate the fine structure of energy dependence of the self energy , @xmath39 , as well as converging the absolute value with respect to empty orbitals . in our modified static remainder approach ,",
    "we calculate both the gw @xmath32 partial sum ( eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] ) and the cohsex @xmath32 partial sum ( eq . [ stat - sum ] ) up to the number of dft bands available .",
    "we then add a modified static correction to the gw coulomb - hole energies :    @xmath40    the factor of 1/2 in eq .",

    "[ stat - sum ] , confirms the factor of @xmath49 .    the coulomb - hole self - energy contribution to the convergence of energy levels in bulk silicon ( using a 5x5x5 * k*-point grid ) and the silane ( sih@xmath50 ) molecule ( in a supercell calculation )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of the band cutoff , @xmath20 , in eq .",
    "[ ch - sum ] .",
    "the convergence on energy levels in silane is significantly slower than that in silicon @xcite because of the large number of free - electron like vacuum states .",

    "the silane calculations were done with a 75 rydberg wavefunction cutoff and a 6 rydberg dielectric matrix cutoff .",
    "the needed volume of the supercell used , @xmath51 , and the corresponding number of vacuum states , is minimized by using a truncated coulomb interaction @xcite . despite this ,",
    "the largest computational cost in the gw calculation on silane is the dft generation of the empty orbitals , representing more than 50% of the total computational expense .",
    "the calculation of the polarizability and the evaluation of the self energy require less computational time , and they scale nearly linearly to thousands of cpus .",

    "the polarizability was computed with 953 orbitals ( 78 occupied + 875 empty orbitals up to 1 rydberg cutoff in dft eigenvalues ) , and the coulomb - hole part of the self - energy was evaluated as a function of the number of orbitals , as shown in fig .",
    "one can see that the coulomb - hole term computed with 953 orbitals without the addition of the remainder is only converged to within 1 ev . including the static remainder correction improves the convergence to better than 0.1 ev .    in conclusion",
    ", we have presented a modified static remainder approach that reduces the number of empty states involved in evaluating @xmath32 by over an order of magnitude .",
    "this approach is particularly useful when applying the gw method to molecules and other nanostructures where absolute energies , as opposed to just energy gaps , are desired .",
    "a limitation of this method is that it does not address the problem of the sum over empty states required in evaluating the dielectric matrix ( eq . [ chi ] ) .",
    "however , the dielectric matrix converges faster than the absolute energies of @xmath32 for many solids @xcite and can more easily be replaced by calculation using the density functional perturbation theory approaches .",
