    "the main problem discussed in the context of stochastic time series in various physical , biological , financial and economical processes is the presence of autocorrelations in data .",
    "one of the technique to check whether such autocorrelations are present in time series is based on the investigation of the fractal structure in time series and is related to the scaling exponent h , sometimes denoted also as @xmath1 @xcite@xcite and called hurst exponent .",
    "it plays a significant role as the main concept upon which fluctuations of a time series around its local trend ( drift ) are formed and it may be considered as the one of the crucial points responsible for genetic code of time series of various origin . for",
    "the purpose of mentioned above fractal analysis one can introduce the scaling exponent @xmath1 as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the time series defined for discrete time points  @xmath4 . by rescaling time axis @xmath5 times ( e.g. enlarging it @xmath6 ) , one reveals the tiny structure of time series not visible for smaller resolution ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the fractal structure of the series comes from the relation :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 means similarity correspondence .",
    "the above formula indicates that the magnitude of rescaled time series @xmath10 should be simultaneously increased @xmath11 times in order to satisfy full ( local ) equivalence of @xmath2 and @xmath12 series .",
    "+ it turns out that the scaling factor @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of time rescaling factor @xmath14 with the use of hurst - hausdorff @xmath15 exponent ( @xmath16 ) :    @xmath17    the commonly accepted methods to measure @xmath1 exponent are rescaled range analysis ( r / s ) , spectral density analysis @xcite , and detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) @xcite .",
    "recently , new method called detrended moving average ( dma ) has also been proposed @xcite . in this article",
    "we will focus on the latter two methods due to large uncertainties in spectral density analysis and problems with r / s predictions in nonstationary series .",
    "searches for better understanding how results of these two methods relate to each other are in progress @xcite@xcite .",
    "a dfa method was first developed for biological purposes @xcite and then applied also to finances @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is a detrendisation technique basically measuring fluctuations of a given time series around its local trend as a function of the trend length .",
    "let us recall the main steps of this method :    1 .   a given signal @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) of time series is divided into @xmath18 not overlapping boxes of length @xmath19 each",
    "a polynomial fit @xmath20 is constructed in each box representing the local trend in that box , where @xmath21 is the order of polynomial fit .",
    "a detrended signal @xmath22 is found : @xmath23 and then its fluctuation ( standard deviation)@xmath24 is calculated @xmath25 4 .   from the basic differential stochastic equation of the time series @xmath2 with a local drift @xmath26 and a local dispersion @xmath27 + @xmath28 +",
    "one expects the power law behavior : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the searched hurst exponent .",
    "the last equation enables to calculate @xmath1 exponent directly from log - log linear fit :    @xmath31    it can be proved that @xmath30 depends very weakly on @xmath21 @xcite so in most application one takes linear function @xmath32 as a good candidate for @xmath20 .",
    "this approach will also be used in our paper .",
    "it turns out that the bigger @xmath1 the more quiet time series is , i.e. a signal fluctuates in a more correlated way .",
    "in fact , for @xmath33 we have negative autocorrelations ( antipersistence ) in time series . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath34 , there are positive autocorrelations ( persistence ) in signal .",
    "the case @xmath35 corresponds to completely uncorrelated signal , so called integer brownian walk .",
    "an existing link between @xmath1 exponent and the probability that a given trend will last in the immediate future if it did so in the immediate past gives an additional hint about trend changes forecast possibility @xcite .",
    "a detrended moving average ( dma ) technique looks very similar to dfa .",
    "the main difference one meets here is that instead of linear or polynomial detrendisation procedure in equally sized boxes , one uses moving average of a given length @xmath36 .",
    "the basic steps of dma analysis are then :    1 .",
    "a simple moving average of length @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is constructed for @xmath2 series",
    "@xmath38 : @xmath39 2 .",
    "a detrended signal is found similarly to eq .",
    "( [ gr3 ] ) : @xmath40 and its fluctuation within a window of size @xmath36 reads now : @xmath41 3 .",
    "similarly to dfa a power law should be observed @xmath42 where @xmath1 is the searched scaling hurst exponent .",
    "the dma technique is less complicated and seems to be faster in practical application than dfa algorithm .",
    "however , so far no final clear conclusion has been reached regarding mutual relationship between dfa and dma results for the same series.this article contributes to the above area of interest .",
    "preliminary results obtained for some real financial series @xcite suggest that @xmath43 values are lower than corresponding @xmath44 results .",
    "it seems to be confirmed for the set of artificial time series of length @xmath45 constructed with the use of random midpoint displacement ( rmd ) algorithm where one finds @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "this supports the existence of systematic displacement between dfa and dma results , at least for longer series . in many practical applications however , the length of time series we deal with is shorter ( e.g. finance , biology , genetics , medicine ) , especially if one looks at the _ local @xmath1 exponent _ value rather than the global one @xcite .    to attack the problem of mutual dependence between dma and dfa results for series of various length ,",
    "let us first look at the set of artificial arithmetic integer brownian time series of length @xmath47 with discrete time interval @xmath48 , i.e. : @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) are centered and normalized displacements generated by random number generator .",
    "two cases with opposite relation @xmath43 vs @xmath44 are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the first case @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in the other one @xmath54 and @xmath55 . thus no systematic relationship is produced .",
    "this induces to treat the problem statistically , i.e. one should find statistical distributions of hurst exponents measured within two methods for artificial series of various length .",
    "it seems to be interesting to compare two statistics and to work out correlations between scaling exponents measured within dma and dfa techniques for the same sample of time series .    for this purpose we took samples of arithmetic brownian time series of length @xmath56 in the range @xmath57 .",
    "each sample contained @xmath58 series of fixed length .",
    "we tried to cover uniformly the whole range of @xmath56 in log - scale keeping @xmath59 with the approximate log step @xmath60 to create variety of lengths .    for any sample of fixed length series the averaged scaling range @xmath61 or",
    "@xmath62 has been calculated for defined number of candidates ( @xmath63 ) and the corresponding standard deviation @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the scaling range was taken as the range of @xmath19 or @xmath36 variables strictly obeying scaling laws of eqs .",
    "( [ gr7]),([gr11 ] ) and assumed to terminate respectively at @xmath66 for dfa and @xmath67 for dma . only series with regression statistical correlation coefficient @xmath68 were taken into account for @xmath1 exponent extraction . for any sample of time",
    "series a statistical distribution of @xmath44 and @xmath43 frequencies has been built .",
    "the full range of obtained distribution results is shown in fig.2 - 9 .",
    "the first observation one makes is that for any length @xmath56 both distributions fit very well normal distributions , but with different parameters for the gaussian curve .",
    "we made all plots also for centered and normalized @xmath1 frequencies in semi - log scale ( fig.2(b , c)9(b , c ) ) .",
    "only small deviations from the normal distribution are observed in tails - basically due to smaller statistics there . a good correspondence with gaussian curve",
    "is confirmed also in kolmogorov and anderson - darling tests , whose results are displayed in table 1 and shown for chosen lengths @xmath56 in fig.10 .",

    "this can be explained in terms of different sensitivity of dfa and dma techniques to the presence of random autocorrelations in time series .",
    "such autocorrelations are naturally randomly distributed in any sample of generated time series and hence a distribution of @xmath1 exponent is normal .",
    "the probability of random autocorrelations is bigger for short time series , where all statistical fluctuations manifest in a more vivid way .",
    "when @xmath56 increases , their influence on the presumed global autocorrelation in series can be neglected .",
    "therefore , both standard deviations @xmath74 and @xmath75 drop with increasing @xmath56 . however , we always observe @xmath76 , what indicates that dma technique is more sensitive to such `` autocorrelation noise '' than dfa one .",
    "one may look at this problem also from another side - like in fig .",
    "we have drawn several plots of dfa and dma analysis , i.e. @xmath77 vs @xmath78 or @xmath79 for several corresponding artificial brownian series of length @xmath80 .",
    "it is seen that deviations from the strict power law behavior , if occur , are more drastic for dma than for dfa case and the dispersion of produced slopes is also larger for dma than for dfa , despite the fact that dma plots are more smooth in comparison with dfa ones .",
    "the next observation concerns the mean values .",
    "one gets @xmath81 for all @xmath56 , where @xmath82 is taken over a sample of @xmath83 time series . a  clear shift of the central dma values to the right with respect to dfa ones ( see figs .",
    "29(a ) ) does not suggest however the presence of systematic relation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 . indeed evaluating the correlation coefficient ( values",
    "are shown in the description of fig .",
    "29(a ) ) :    @xmath84    one finds it increasing with @xmath56 , but it never indicates the full correlation . its value is maximal for large @xmath56 , where @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "this situation is graphically illustrated in fig .",
    "12 , where a correlation plot @xmath44 vs @xmath43 is shown for hurst exponent values obtained for @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 series . from the asymmetry of plots against diagonal one notices that dma gives higher values than dfa method in most series .",
    "this result is independent on the length of time series .",
    "in fact the percentage excess of cases @xmath90 , where @xmath91 over the cases where @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , i.e. :    @xmath94    changes from @xmath95 for series with @xmath96 up to @xmath97 for longer series .",
    "it is obvious therefore that the mean of difference @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is not a good measure of distance between two investigated methods .",
    "it is more convenient to define this distance in a standard way , i.e. : @xmath100    the sufficient number of time series samples of various length has been worked out to find a relationship @xmath101 .",
    "the polynomial best fit for the collected data is drawn in fig .  13 with error bars coming from the uncertainties in slope determination .",
    "this plot indicates that the average displacement between @xmath44 and @xmath43 exponents for a given time series ranges from @xmath102 for series with @xmath103 , down to @xmath104 for long series ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the latter value is much smaller than one reported in @xcite .",
    "the fastest drop in dfa - dma distance is observed for medium length series , i.e. when @xmath106 .",
    "for such series @xmath107 makes on the average @xmath108 of @xmath44 value .",
    "this might be of interest if more detailed study of @xmath1 exponent is required for more exact predictions to be made(e.g .",
    "heart diseases , finances , etc . ) .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "13 may also suggests that @xmath109 when @xmath110 .",
    "the latter case has not been explored in details .",
    "we report from the analysis of artificial brownian integer time series and from the collected data that , on the average , dma method overestimates hurst exponent values in comparison with dfa technique .",
    "this result contradicts to some previous hypothesis in literature .",
    "the dma method seems to be also more sensitive to the presence of random fluctuations in autocorrelations in time series than dfa analysis does . in many practical situations , especially for shorter series",
    ", it might be a disadvantage leading to the false signal of not really existing , global autocorrelations in time series .",
