    "let @xmath1 be a finite compact metric graph .",
    "that is , @xmath1 has finitely many edges and each edge is equipped with coordinates ( denoted @xmath2 ) that identify this edge with a bounded interval of the real line .",
    "we choose some subset of vertices of @xmath1 , to be called _ external vertices _ , and attach one or more copies of @xmath3 , to be called _ leads _",
    ", to each external vertex ; the point @xmath4 in a lead is thus identified with the relevant external vertex .",
    "we call the thus extended graph @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 has no `` tadpoles '' , i.e.  no edge starts and ends at the same vertex ; this can always be achieved by introducing additional vertices , if necessary . in order to distinguish the edges of @xmath1 from the leads",
    ", we will call the former the _ internal edges _ of @xmath0 .",
    "in @xmath5 we consider the self - adjoint operator @xmath6 with the continuity condition and the kirchhoff boundary condition at each vertex of @xmath0 ; see section  [ sec.b ] for the precise definitions .",
    "the metric graph @xmath0 equipped with the self - adjoint operator @xmath7 in @xmath5 is called the _",
    "quantum graph_. we refer to the surveys @xcite for a general exposition of quantum graph theory .",
    "if the set of leads is non - empty , it is easy to show by standard techniques ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1 ) ) that the spectrum of @xmath7 is @xmath3 .",
    "the operator @xmath7 may have embedded eigenvalues .",
    "the `` classical '' definition of resonances is    [ def0 ] we will say that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is a _ resonance _ of @xmath7 ( or , by a slight abuse of terminology , a resonance of @xmath0 ) if there exists a _ resonance eigenfunction _ @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath11 , which satisfies the equation @xmath12 on each edge and lead of @xmath0 , is continuous on @xmath0 , satisfies the kirchhoff s boundary condition at each vertex of @xmath0 and the _ radiation condition _",
    "@xmath13 on each lead of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the set of all resonances of @xmath7 by @xmath14 .",
    "any solution to on a lead @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 ; the above definition requires that there exists a non - zero solution with all coefficients @xmath17 vanishing .",
    "it is easy to see that all resonances must satisfy @xmath18 ; indeed , if @xmath19 with @xmath20 is a resonance then the corresponding resonance eigenfunction is in @xmath5 , so @xmath21 is an eigenvalue of @xmath7 , which is impossible since @xmath22 . as we will only be interested in the asymptotics of the number of resonances in large disks , we exclude the case @xmath23 from further consideration . in the absence of leads ,",
    "the spectrum of @xmath7 consists of non - negative eigenvalues and @xmath9 is a resonance if and only if @xmath24 and @xmath25 is an eigenvalue of @xmath7 .",
    "it is well known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that the above `` classical '' definition of a resonance coincides with the definition via exterior complex scaling ( see @xcite ) . in the complex scaling approach ,",
    "the resonances of @xmath7 are identified with the eigenvalues of an auxiliary non - selfadjoint operator @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the _ algebraic multiplicity _ of a resonance is then defined as the algebraic multiplicity of the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath26 .",
    "we discuss this in more detail in section  [ sec.b ] , where we show that the multiplicity is independent of @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , we show ( in theorem  [ thm.b3 ] ) that any @xmath24 , @xmath9 , is a resonance if and only if @xmath25 is an eigenvalue of @xmath7 and in this case the corresponding multiplicities coincide .",
    "we define the _ resonance counting function _ by @xmath29 with the convention that each resonance is counted with its algebraic multiplicity taken into account .",
    "note that the set @xmath14 of resonances is invariant under the symmetry @xmath30 , so this method of counting yields , roughly speaking , twice as many resonances as one would obtain if one imposed an additional condition @xmath31 .",
    "in particular , in the absence of leads , @xmath32 equals twice the number of eigenvalues @xmath33 of @xmath7 ( counting multiplicities ) with @xmath34 .",
    "this paper is concerned with the asymptotics of the resonance counting function @xmath32 as @xmath35 .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is a _ weyl graph _ , if @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the sum of the lengths of the edges of @xmath1 .",
    "if there are no leads then @xmath7 has pure point spectrum , resonances are identified with eigenvalues of @xmath7 and weyl s law may be proved by dirichlet - neumann bracketing .",
    "thus , every compact quantum graph is weyl in our sense .",
    "as we show below , in the presence of leads this may not be the case .",
    "we call an external vertex @xmath38 of @xmath0 _ balanced _ if the number of leads attached to @xmath38 equals the number of internal edges attached to @xmath38",
    ". if @xmath38 is not balanced , we call it _ unbalanced_. our main result is    [ th1 ] one has @xmath39 where the coefficient @xmath40 satisfies @xmath41 .",
    "one has @xmath42 if and only if every external vertex of @xmath0 is unbalanced .",
    "this theorem shows , in particular , that as the graph becomes larger and more complex the failure of weyl s law becomes increasingly likely in an obvious sense .",
    "the simplest example of a graph @xmath0 with a balanced external vertex occurs when exactly one lead @xmath43 and exactly one internal edge @xmath44 meet at a vertex . in this case",
    ", one can merge @xmath44 and @xmath43 into a new lead ; this will not affect the resonances of @xmath0 but will reduce @xmath45 .",
    "this already shows that @xmath0 can not be weyl .",
    "section  [ sec.f ] discusses the second most simple example .",
    "our proof of theorem  [ th1 ] consists of two steps .",
    "the first step is to identify the set @xmath14 of resonances with the set of zeros of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a certain analytic matrix - valued function .",
    "this identification is straightforward , but it has a subtle aspect : this is to show that the algebraic multiplicity of a resonance coincides with the order of the zero of @xmath46 .",
    "this is done in sections  [ sec.c][sec.d ] by employing a range of rather standard techniques of spectral theory , including a resolvent identity which involves the dirichlet - to - neumann map .",
    "the function @xmath46 turns out to be an exponential polynomial . by a classical result ( theorem  [ langer ] )",
    ", the asymptotics of the zeros of an exponential polynomial can be explicitly expressed in terms of the coefficients of this polynomial .",
    "thus , the second step of our proof is a direct and completely elementary analysis of the matrix @xmath47 which allows us to relate the required information about the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath46 to the question of whether the external vertices of @xmath0 are balanced .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec.e ] .",
    "resonance asymptotics of weyl type have been established for compactly supported potentials on the real line , a class of super - exponentially decaying potentials on the real line , compactly supported potentials on cylinders and laplace operators on surfaces with finite volume hyperbolic cusps in @xcite respectively .",
    "the proofs rely upon theorems about the zeros of certain classes of entire functions .",
    "likewise , our analysis uses a simple classical result ( theorem  [ langer ] ) about zeros of exponential polynomials .",
    "the situation with resonance asymptotics for potential and obstacle scattering in euclidean space in dimensions greater than one and in hyperbolic space is more complicated and still not fully understood ; the current state of knowledge is described in @xcite . here",
    "we remark only that generically , the resonance asymptotics in the multi - dimensional case is not given by the weyl formula .",
    "we hope that theorem  [ th1 ] can provide some insight to the multi - dimensional case .",
    "resonances for quantum graphs have been discussed in a recent publication @xcite .",
    "our paper has very little technical content in common with @xcite , in spite of their common theme .      in section  [ sec.f ]",
    "we consider the resonances of a particularly simple quantum graph which can be described as a circle with two leads attached to it .",
    "theorem  [ th1 ] says that if the leads are attached at different points on the circle , the corresponding quantum graph is weyl , and if they are attached at the same point , we have a non - weyl graph .",
    "when the two points where the leads are attached move closer to each other and eventually coalesce , one observes the transition from the weyl to the non - weyl case .",
    "we study this transition in much detail .",
    "we show that as the two external vertices get closer , `` half '' of the resonances move off to infinity . in the course of this analysis , we also obtain bounds on the positions of individual resonances for this model .",
    "the same example was recently considered by exner and lipovsky @xcite subject to general boundary conditions that include the kirchhoff s boundary condition case as a singular limit .",
    "although some of their results are broadly similar to ours , none of our theorems may be found in @xcite .",
    "here we introduce the necessary notation , recall the definition of resonances via the complex scaling procedure and show that the resonances on the real axis coincide with the eigenvalues of @xmath7 .",
