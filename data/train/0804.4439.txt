    "type ia supernovae , being one of the most luminous stellar outburst , form a fairly homogeneous class of objects and are considered as standard candles for determining extragalactic distances and cosmological parameters .",
    "type ia supernovae are produced by thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ) primarily composed of carbon and oxygen nuclei .",
    "the probable explosion scenario involves a binary system in which a white dwarf accretes matter from its companion star until it reaches the chandrasekhar mass limit of 1.4 m@xmath10 .",
    "though type ia supernovae show homogeneity in both their photometric as well as spectroscopic properties ( hflich et al .",
    "1996 ) but many sne show significant deviations .",
    "( 2001 ) studied a sample of type ia supernovae and conclude that @xmath1 64 percent of them belong to the normal group , almost 20 percent belong to the over luminous group of events such as sn 1991 t whereas about 16 percent belong to the sub luminous type such as sn 1991bg .",
    "the last few decades have witnessed a large number of diverse data sets for sne ia .",
    "nevertheless , type ia supernovae seem to follow a few common patterns .",
    "one of these is the correlation between the peak luminosity and the linear decline rate ( phillips 1993 ) .",
    "the color evolution , spectral appearance and the host galaxy morphology are the other correlations .",
    "the peak absolute magnitude of type ia sne is correlated with the hubble type of the parent galaxy .",
    "sne ia hosted by elliptical galaxies are comparatively fainter than sne ia in spirals ( della valle & panagia 1992 , howell 2001 ) . even amongst the normal group of type ia sne significant photometric and spectroscopic uncertainties",
    "nugent et al .",
    "( 1995 ) saw that the spectral variations in type ia sne correlate with the expansion velocity , the effective temperature and the peak luminosity .",
    "thus , it is not sufficient to describe sne ia by a single parameter such as the early light curve decline rather the diversity noticed is multi - dimensional ( hatano et al .",
    "2000 , benetti et al .",
    "it is therefore , necessary to study the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of individual type ia sne .",
    "the integrated flux in optical bands provides a meaningful estimate of the bolometric luminosity which is directly related to the amount of radioactive @xmath9ni synthesised and ejected in the explosion ( arnett 1982 , hflich et al .",
    "1996 , pinto & eastman 2000a ) which can later be used to test various explosion models of type ia supernovae .",
    "we present in this paper the optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of highly reddened type ia supernova sn 2003hx .",
    "sn 2003hx was discovered on unfiltered kait images on 2003 september 12.5 ut ( magnitude 14.3 ) and 13.5 ut ( magnitude 14.4 ) by burket , papenkova & li ( 2003 ) . a kait image of the same region taken on 2003 march 7.2 ut shows nothing at the location of the supernova to a limiting magnitude of @xmath1 18.5 .",

    "the si ii 635.5 nm line gives an expansion velocity of @xmath1 12000 km / sec if the ned recession velocity for the host is adopted as 2142 km / sec ( salvo , norris & schmidt , 2003 ) .",
    "it was confirmed to be a type ia supernova around 10 days past maximum light with the spectropolarimetric observations using the eso very large telescope on 2003 september 15.4 ut ( wang & baade , 2003 ) .",
    "the interstellar na i d line has an equivalent width of 4.86 which indicates significant dust extinction .",
    "the observed degree of polarization is @xmath1 2 percent ( wang & baade , 2003 ) .",
    "if this polarization is due to the dust in the host galaxy , then it implies that the dust particles are significantly smaller in size than their galactic counterparts .",
    "these observations yield a value of 2.2 for the ratio of total to selective extinction , @xmath16 ( wang & baade , 2003 ) .",
    "we have carried out the optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ia supernova sn 2003hx .",
    "a brief description of the observations and data analysis is given in section [ observations ] , whereas the development of the light curves and color curves are presented in section [ light_curves ] .",
    "section [ reddening ] discusses about the reddening estimate .",
    "the description about the absolute magnitude , the bolometric luminosity and the estimation of @xmath9ni ejected are discussed in section [ bolometric ] .",

    "the observations of sn 2003hx were carried out with the 2-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) at indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) , hanle during 2003 september 18 to 2004 february 03 which was six days after the discovery on 2003 september 12 . the himalayan faint object spectrograph camera ( hfosc ) equipped with the site 2",

    "all the images were bias subtracted , flat fielded and cosmic ray removed in the standard fashion using various tasks in iraf .",

    "we performed aperture photometry on the local standards using an aperture of 3 - 4 times the @xmath23 of the seeing profile that was determined on the basis of an aperture growth curve .",
    "accurate estimate of sky and its subtraction plays a crucial role in the photometry when the object falls on the varying background . the supernova was just next to the nucleus of the galaxy , we therefore had to perform template subtraction to get a better estimate of the underlying background .",
    "the template observations were taken with the same instrumental setup , on 26 october 2005 , nearly two years after the supernova discovery , when the supernova had faded .",
    "these templates were subtracted from the images of sn obtained during 2003 - 2004 .",
    "one such subtracted image , showing only the supernova sn 2003hx , is shown in figure [ sn2003hx ] . when the seeing was not very good , the template subtraction was not perfect and showed signature of the galaxy . here , the supernova magnitudes were determined by using the profile - fitting method with a fitting radius equal to that of the @xmath23 of the seeing profile .",
    "the difference between the aperture and profile - fitting magnitudes was obtained using standards and was applied to the supernova magnitudes .",
