    "investigation of the neutron - deuteron ( nd ) elastic scattering and the deuteron breakup reaction  @xcite revealed a number of discrepancies between data and theoretical predictions based on modern nucleon - nucleon potentials such as av18  @xcite , cd  bonn  @xcite , and nijm1 , 2 and 93  @xcite or on the nuclear forces derived in the framework of chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "these potentials describe very accurately all existing nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) data as expressed by the value of @xmath1 per data point close to @xmath2 . some of these discrepancies can be explained when in adddition to pairwise interactions also three - nucleon forces ( 3nf s ) are included in the 3n hamiltonian . however , some persistently avoid explanation and they reveal high insensitivity to the underlying dynamics , especially to different choices among available 3nf s . the neutron - neutron ( nn ) quasi - free - scattering ( qfs ) configuration in the complete nd breakup is one such an example .",
    "another is the symmetrical space - star ( sst ) geometry in that reaction .",
    "the nn qfs refers to the kinematical configuration in which the outgoing proton is at rest in the laboratory system . in case of sst three outgoing nucleons",
    "have equal magnitudes of momenta , which in the three - nucleon c.m . system form a plane perpendicular to the incoming nucleon momentum with the angle of @xmath3 between two consequitive momenta . in qfs and sst configurations theoretical predicitons drastically underestimate by about @xmath4 the data .",
    "this together with the fact that cross sections in these configurations are dominated by the @xmath0 and @xmath5 contributions lead to suspect that something is wrong with the @xmath0 nn force and that maybe two neutrons can even form a bound state  @xcite .",
    "that motivated us to investigate what consequences the existence of the @xmath0 dineutron would have on different observables in nd reactions and to what degree the available data for nd reactions allow for such a bound state .",
    "also we would like to see if existence of dineutron could help in resolving the discrepancies present in qfs and sst nd breakup configurations .    in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we extend our formulation of the momentum space treatment of the 3n faddeev equations to include , in addition to the deuteron , also the @xmath0 bound state of two neutrons . changing the strength of @xmath0 nn interaction of the cd  bonn potential we produce a number of forces which allow for two neutrons being bound with different dineutron binding energy . in section [ sec2 ] we present theoretical predictions based on solution of 3n faddeev equations and compare them to the available nd data .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "we shortly present the basics of our momentum space treatment of 3n faddeev equations and calculations of the transition operators for different reactions in the 3n continuum based on solutions of these equations . for detailed presentation",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "we put emphasis on changes in the standard approach in the case when , beside the deuteron , also one additional bound state appears in some partial wave .    for calculation of processes initiated from a state @xmath6 , which describes the neutron moving with the relative momentum @xmath7 with respect to the deuteron of the wave function @xmath8 ,",
    "one needs the state @xmath9 which fulfills 3n fadddeev equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined in terms of transposition operators of three nucleons , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the free 3n propagator , and t is the two - nucleon off - shell t - matrix . knowing @xmath14 the breakup as well as the elastic nd scattering amplitudes can be gained by quadratures in the standard manner  @xcite .",
    "namely , the transition amplitude for the elastic scattering , @xmath15 , is given by  @xcite @xmath16 and for the breakup , @xmath17 , by @xmath18 the state @xmath19 corresponds to a kinematically complete configuration of the breakup described by standard jacobi momenta @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the outgoing state of the elastic scattering with changed direction of the relative neutron - deuteron momentum @xmath23 but with the same magnitude as in the entrance channel @xmath24 .",
    "introducing the momentum space 3n partial wave basis @xmath25 with the two - body subsystem angular momenta , spin and isospin @xmath26 and @xmath27 , coupled together with the corresponding quantum numbers of the spectator nucleon @xmath28 and @xmath29 to the total angular momentum @xmath30 and isospin @xmath31 of the 3n system , and projecting eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) on these states , we get the system of coupled integral equations in two continuous variables p and q. for details of the numerical treatment of that system , and particularly of the kernel part @xmath32 , we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the 2-nucleon t - matrix conserves the spectator momentum @xmath33 and all discrete quantum numbers except the orbital angular momentum @xmath34 : @xmath35 and has a pole in channels @xmath36 for which two - nucleon subsystem has bound state .    in the channels @xmath37 which contain the 2-body @xmath38 states we extract the deuteron pole .",
    "thus we define @xmath39 for the deuteron quantum numbers @xmath40 and keep @xmath27 as it is otherwise .",
    "that pole property obviously carries over to the @xmath41-amplitude and we define just for the @xmath37 channels @xmath42 since the energy @xmath43 of the 3n system is determined by the incoming neutron energy @xmath44 : @xmath45 , the deuteron pole occurs at @xmath46 .",
    "when beside the deuteron an additional bound state exists in some 2-nucleon partial wave state one needs to extract in channels @xmath47 which contain that 2-nucleon state the corresponding pole of the t - matrix by performing the same procedure as for the deuteron .",
    "let us assume that this state is a bound state of two neutrons in the @xmath0 state with the wave function @xmath48 and the binding energy @xmath49 , and let us denote by @xmath50 the two body channel build on such dineutron , from which or to which different reactions can be initiated .    in the channels @xmath51 which contain the @xmath0 dineutron we define @xmath52 and",
    "the dineutron pole occurs at @xmath53 .",
    "again that pole property carries over to the @xmath41-amplitude and we define for the @xmath54 channels the amplitude @xmath55 similarily to eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "the numerical treatment of that new pole follows the treatment of the deuteron pole  @xcite and it requires the set of q - points which , in addition to @xmath46 needed for numerical treatment of the deuteron pole , contains also @xmath56 point .",
    "since the dineutron occurs in the neutron - neutron @xmath0 state it implies charge independence breaking and the resulting difference between @xmath0 nn and np interactions causes that the proper treatment of the nd reactions requires inclusion of the total 3n system isospin component @xmath57 for channels @xmath36 containing @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the existence of @xmath0 dineutron increases number of possible reactions with three nucleons what in consequence makes that the unitary relation have to be generalized to include those additional processes .",
    "it has the form @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the deuteron and dineutron channels , respectively .",
    "one can choose @xmath61 or @xmath62 and @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 this leads on the left side to the forward scattering amplitude and on the right to the total cross section .",
    "the energies @xmath66 are given by the binding energies of the deuteron @xmath67 or dineutron @xmath68 .",

    "the geometrical coefficient @xmath86 stems from the matrix elements of the permutation operator @xmath87  @xcite .",
    "in the following we will present and compare to the available nd data the theoretical predictions for cross sections in elastic nd scattering and breakup assuming different @xmath0 nn force . we take the cd  bonn  @xcite potential as the nn interaction and multiplying its @xmath0 nn component by a factor @xmath88 generate a number of @xmath0 nn forces among which some provide binding of two neutrons . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we show values of the nn scattering length @xmath89 , the effective range parameter @xmath90 and the dineutron binding energy @xmath49 for a number of @xmath88 values .",
    "changing @xmath88 from @xmath91 to @xmath92 leads to nn @xmath0 force with different , negative as well as positive , values of the scattering length . in order to see",
    "if conclusions depend from a particular @xmath0 nn potential used and from the method applied to generate the nn bound state , we performed also calculations with a chiral nn potential in next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) of chiral expansion  @xcite adjusting its @xmath0 nn low energy constants to get a dineutron with given binding energy .      the results for the nd total cross sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and , for a number of energies , they are also presented in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the theoretical predictions obtained with different nn @xmath0 forces are compared to numerous data taken over many years .",
    "up to @xmath93  mev there is a nice agreement between all data , especially very precise one of ref .",
    "@xcite , and theory based on the cd  bonn potential .",
    "when instead of the original cd  bonn @xmath0 nn force the modified interaction with factor @xmath94 is taken the resulting cross sections seem to be not excluded by the total cross section data . for @xmath95 , with the dineutron binding energy @xmath96  kev , the predicted total cross sections for energies up to @xmath97  mev differ from the data by about three standard deviations . at higher energies",
    "they clearly lie outside three standard deviations from the data . increasing the factor @xmath88 to @xmath98 or @xmath99 leads to total cross section values strongly overestimating the data .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] we compare theoretical predictions for the total elastic scattering and breakup cross sections , respectively , with the corresponding data . for the elastic scattering component of the total cross section",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , at energies up to about @xmath100  mev , the theoretical predictions with different nn @xmath0 forces are close to each other and they agree with the data . at energies above @xmath100",
    "mev cross sections for @xmath101 start to deviate from standard cd  bonn and @xmath94 values and the data seems to prefer larger values of @xmath88 .    for the total breakup cross sections ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the data seems to be compatible with all theoretical predicitons with exception of data from ref .",
    "that data set taken in the region of energies @xmath102  mev @xmath103  mev clearly advocates the cd  bonn potential predicitons however , it does not exclude definitly values of cross sections obtained with @xmath95 .    at low energies",
    "the nd interaction is parametrized by the doublet , @xmath104 , and quartet , @xmath105 , scattering lengths .",
    "while @xmath104 is strongly influenced by a 3nf the @xmath105 is practically insensitive to such an interaction  @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we show how these scattering lengths change with modification of the @xmath0 nn cd  bonn potential . while the doublet scattering length drastically changes with @xmath88 the quartet scattering length practicaly remains constant under such modifications of the @xmath0 nn force staying close to the experimental value @xmath106  fm  @xcite .",
    "the nd elastic scattering angular distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at c.m .",
    "scattering angles @xmath107 different theories practically overlapp and agree with the data for all four energies shown .",
    "such behaviour is not suprising since at backward angles the exchange term @xmath72 , given by the deuteron wave function , dominates the elastic scattering transition amplitude .",
    "the properties of the nn @xmath0 interaction should play decisive role at forward angles .",
    "indeed , at forward angles below @xmath108 differences between theoretical predictions based on different nn @xmath0 forces start to appear and they increase with deacreasing angle .",
    "however , in the forward angular region the nd elastic scattering cross section data are lacking with exception of @xmath109  mev where 5 data points fall into that region of angles .",
    "while two data points at smallest angles support the cd  bonn cross sections three other at greater angles prefer the larger values of @xmath88 .",
    "the precise nd elastic scattering data at forward angles are required to decide if stronger nn @xmath0 force is allowed .      among numerous kinematically",
    "complete breakup configurations the largest discrepancies between theory and data have been found for the nn qfs and sst geometries .",
    "for these configurations the theoretical cross sections are insensitive to the underlying dynamics and they do not change when applying different realistic nn potentials and combining them with available 3nf s . also when instead of the nn qfs one compares the theory with the only one available np qfs data set of the nd breakup  @xcite a nice agreement is found .",
    "qfs and sst configurations are dominated at low energies by the @xmath0 and @xmath5 nn force components  @xcite which practically saturate the qfs and sst cross section at low energies  @xcite .",
    "it would suggests that it is the nn @xmath0 force which is probably responsible for large discrepancy between data and theory .",
    "for qfs configurations we show in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the sensitivity of the nn and np qfs configurations to the underlying nn @xmath0 force .",
    "as expected , changes of that force cause drastic modifications of the nn qfs cross section leaving the np qfs practically without modifications . as was shown in @xcite responsible for such drastic modifications of the nn qfs cross section are changes of the effective range parameter induced by factor @xmath88 .",
    "the changes in the nn scattering length practically leave the nn qfs cross sections without modifications .",
    "in contrast to the nn qfs the sst geometry is more stable against changes of the @xmath0 nn force . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] changing the factor @xmath88 does not bring theory closer to the data . while @xmath94 provides smaller sst cross sections than the cd  bonn potential , taking factor @xmath101 and increasing it so that dineutron is formed , leads to cross sections which again are below the cd  bonn potential predicitons .",
    "therefore by modifications of the @xmath0 nn force it is not possible to explain the large discrepancy for sst . since it is unprobable that the deuteron properties are so badly known that the @xmath38 nn force component would require modification , the source for that disagreement must be sought elsewhere .",
    "one possibility could be the indirect influence by the dineutron some breakup configurations by contributing in specific regions of a phase - space to the breakup background .    for the @xmath0 nn force which allows a dineutron",
    "the nn scattering length becomes positive .",
    "it should have drastic influence on the nn final - state - interaction ( fsi ) of the nd breakup , where the two outgoing neutrons , having the same momenta , are strongly interacting in the @xmath0 state .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the changes in the fsi peak when the nn scattering length @xmath89 changes from negative to positive values .",
    "for the same magnitude of @xmath89 the nn fsi cross section is strongly diminished for the positive sign of @xmath89 .",
    "the question arises if the existing nn fsi cross section data can be understood when dineutron exists ?    to answer that question we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] cross sections for 4 kinematically complete nn fsi configurations for which data have been taken and analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite with the aim to extract the neutron - neutron scattering length .",
    "the consistent values of @xmath89 have been found in each of those 4 configurations with the average value of @xmath110  fm . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , again changing @xmath89 to positive values diminishes significantly the nn fsi cross sections . comparing cross sections obtained with @xmath111 and @xmath95 to the cd  bonn potential values clearly demonstrates that no theoretical analysis of @xcite data , when performed with positive values of @xmath89 , would provide consistent values for the nn scattering length in those 4 geometries .",
    "while the analysis of @xmath112 configuration would probably provide @xmath113  fm , a similar analysis of configurations at smaller @xmath114 would provide distinctly larger positive nn scattering lengths .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show further 3 fsi configurations for which data have been taken . for @xmath115 complete breakup the data of ref .",
    "@xcite support the cd  bonn potential cross section predictions .",
    "each of 2 complete configurations in that reaction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] contain two np fsi peaks .",
    "the theoretical analysis of these np fsi peaks , if performed with positive values of @xmath89 , would provide different values for the neutron - proton scattering length @xmath116 , which in addition would be inconsistent with well known @xmath116 experimental value .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show also the configuration for @xmath117 breakup in which data have been taken and analyzed in ref .  @xcite . that geometry contains both np and nn fsi peaks",
    "again , the analysis of the np fsi peak , if performed with positive @xmath89 , would provide too large magnitude for @xmath116 .    to see how our conclusions depend on the nn potential used and on the method applied to modify the @xmath0 nn force we present in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] also cross sections obtained with next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) chiral perturbation theory potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , including in calculations all np and nn forces up to the total angular momentum @xmath118 in the two - nucleon subsystem .",
    "the @xmath0 component of that interaction is composed of the one- and two - pion exchange terms and contact interactions parametrized by two parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 @xmath121 standard values are @xmath122  gev@xmath123 and @xmath124  gev@xmath125 for cutoff combinations @xmath126  mev@xmath127  mev@xmath128  @xcite . by multiplying @xmath119 by a factor @xmath129 and @xmath120 by a factor @xmath130 , one can induce changes of the nn @xmath0 interaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show two predictions based on the nlo potential with negative ( @xmath131  fm - the ( magenta ) dashed - dotted line ) and positive ( @xmath132  fm - the ( green ) double - dashed - dotted line ) values of the neutron - neutron scattering length . comparing them with different cd  bonn potential predictions and taking into account differences between their @xmath89 values it is clearly seen that both potentials and methods of changing @xmath0 nn interaction lead to the same conclusions .",
    "fsi region can also be investigated in the uncomplete breakup measurement , in which spectrum of the outgoing proton is measured at given lab . angle . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show modifications of the outgoing proton spectrum for @xmath133  mev nd breakup at proton lab . angle @xmath134 .",
    "here changing the sign of @xmath89 leads to disappearing of the fsi peak .",
    "in addition , at lower energies of the outgoing proton the modification of @xmath0 nn force by factors @xmath101 significantly increases the uncomplete breakup cross section .",
    "the analysis of existing nd uncomplete breakup spectra performed in @xcite indicated on the inconsistencies in the experimental uncomplete nd breakup data and revealed unexplained differences of more than @xmath135 in regions of the outgoing proton energies where large number of different three - nucleon configurations contribute to the cross section .",
    "the question arises if existence of the dineutron and corresponding modification of the @xmath0 nn force can account for that and if the clear fsi peaks appearing in the experimental outgoing proton spectra provide evidence for existence of dineutron . in order to answer that question a theoretical monte carlo analysis of experimental spectra , which would provide the angular distribution for the dineutron cross section ,",
    "is required .",
    "the resulting angular distribution should then be compared to the theoretical angular distribution for @xmath136 transition .",
    "however , in view of the results presented above for the complete nn fsi configurations for which data are available , it seems highly unprobable that analysis of incomplete spectra will provide a clear signal for existence of dineutron .      for values of factor @xmath95 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which allow for the bound @xmath0 state of two neutrons ,",
    "the transition to the proton - dineutron channel is possible . in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we show angular distributions for @xmath69 reaction .",
    "the cross sections for that reaction are by an order of magnitude smaller than for the nd elastic scattering , with largest cross sections at backward c.m .",
    "angles for low incoming neutron energies .    in view of the discrepancies found in the nd breakup reaction , especially in sst configuration , it is interesting to consider in which phase - space region that hypothetical dineutron state could mostly affect the breakup configurations by contributing in an uncontrolled manner to the background . to answer that question again monte",
    "carlo simulations of experimental conditions are required .",
    "we have investigated how far available nd data allow for hypothetical @xmath0 bound state of two neutrons and if such dineutron can help to explain the discrepancies between theory and data found in some complete nd breakup configurations . to this aim we extended our numerical momentum space treatment of 3n faddeev equations to include in addition to the deuteron also @xmath0 dineutron .",
    "solution of these equations with modified nn @xmath0 cd  bonn force provided predictions for cross section in different nd reactions .",

    "the data for the total elastic scattering and breakup cross sections do not exclude such a possibilty . also data for the nd elastic scattering angular distribution can not decisively exclude such a state .",

    "the modifications of the @xmath0 nn force component can not provide explanation for the drastic discrepancy between theory and data for the sst geometry of the nd breakup .",
