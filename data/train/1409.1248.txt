    "the first quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol , conceived in 1984 ( bb84 ) @xcite , is an inherently discrete protocol ; it not only requires ( discrete ) single photon sources , but the modulation of the signals is also discrete .",
    "although the ideal bb84 has been proved unconditionally secure @xcite , there are still practical shortcomings : reliable single photon sources ( used by alice , the sender ) are hard to build , and photon counters ( used by bob , the receiver ) limit the key generation rate .",
    "notwithstanding fully discrete - variable protocols have been successfully accomplished over distances of more than @xmath0 km in ultra low loss fibres @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "several alternative qkd protocols using other ( continuous - variable ) light sources have been proposed - employing , for instance , squeezed states @xcite or coherent states @xcite . in such continuous - variable protocols , the key may be encoded by alice in the quadrature variables , and bob will be allowed to employ photomultipliers ( which are faster than single photon detectors ) to read the signals via homodyne detection .",
    "continuous - variable protocols may be classified as : i ) all continuous protocols @xcite , for which alice prepares , for instance , gaussian states such as coherent states , with random amplitudes drawn from a continuous gaussian distribution , or ii ) hybrid protocols @xcite . in the hybrid protocols alice uses light prepared in continuous - variable light signals , but the encoding is made using a discrete set of states ( e.g. , four states ) . at the same time we are witnessing considerable advances concerning the implementation of qkd in real - world conditions @xcite which usually requires long - distance communication .",
    "the all continuous - variable protocols are mostly based on coherent states , which are easier to generate than other quantum states of light",
    ". however , coherent state based protocols are normally more effective in shorter ranges , due to poor performance in low signal - to - noise ratio conditions .",
    "recently , though , a record of @xmath1 km has been established for an improved version @xcite of the gg02 continuous - variable protocol @xcite . in spite of those advances",
    ", it would be interesting to seek other possibilities for long - distance qkd .",
    "a viable alternative are the hybrid continuous / discrete protocols , which may employ either gaussian or non - gaussian states .",
    "we would like to remark that continuous - variable non - gaussian states ( contrary to gaussian states ) may allow the use of quantum repeaters in order to increase the transmission range of a practical qkd system @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we propose a protocol for qkd based on continuous - variable non - gaussian states , viz .",
    ", photon added then subtracted coherent states ( pascs ) .",
    "the pascs may be generated in a relatively straightforward way departing from a gaussian ( coherent ) state @xcite .",
    "we may then formulate a protocol similar to already existing continuous - variable protocols @xcite employing homodyne detection and post - selection @xcite .",
    "we encode bits @xmath2 and @xmath3 in two pairs of pascs ( each pair containing states with opposite phases ) , which are randomly prepared by alice .",
    "alice sends light signals to bob through a lossy line , who will perform homodyne detections on them . in order to demonstrate the robustness of our protocol against eavesdropping",
    ", we calculate the transmitted secret bit rate , @xmath4 @xcite for a beam splitter attack ( superior channel attack ) , as well as for a kind of intercept - resend attack ( simultaneous measurement quadrature attack ) . that analysis will allow us to assess the security of the protocol using two different attacks as well as to establish a comparison with the performance of other protocols .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly introduce the pascs . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the basic structure of the protocol . in section 4 , we analyze the performance of our protocol under the superior channel attack : we calculate the secret key rate of our protocol and compare the results with those obtained using a similar protocol using coherent states . in section 5",
    "we consider a intercept - resend attack : the simultaneous measurement quadrature attack .",
    "we evaluate the eavesdropper success rate for both the pascs and the coherent states .",
    "in section 6 , we discuss the results and present our conclusions .",
    "it is possible to perform quantum state engineering , via conditional measurements by adding and/or subtracting photons of a quantized light field , as discussed in @xcite . earlier in the nineties there",
    "were envisaged the photon added coherent states ( pacs ) @xcite , which were successfully generated a few years ago @xcite . subsequently , the combination of photon adding and photon subtracting in the electromagnetic field has also been experimentally explored @xcite . in general , the operation of firstly adding @xmath5 photons and then subtracting @xmath6 photons from a coherent state @xmath7 results in the following state ( pascs ) @xcite : @xmath8^{-1/2 } \\hat{a}^l\\hat{a}^\\dagger{}^k |\\alpha\\rangle,\\ ] ] with normalizing constant @xmath9 and where @xmath10 is the laguerre polynomial of order @xmath11 .    of particular interest for our purposes , are the pacs and the pascs having just one photon added and one photon subtracted @xmath12",
    ". thus , from an initial coherent state @xmath7 , we first add one photon to it , or @xmath13 and then subtract one photon from the resulting state , obtaining the pascs @xmath14 .",
    "an interesting feature of the state @xmath15 is that it may be written as a superposition of a coherent state and a photon added coherent state ( pacs ) , i.e. @xmath16 . in other words ,",
    "this specific pascs may be written as a superposition of a gaussian state ( coherent state ) with a non - gaussian component ( pacs ) weighted by @xmath17 .",
    "a useful and well known representation of the field states is the wigner function - a quasiprobability distribution in phase space @xcite . for a density operator @xmath18 ,",
    "the wigner function may be written as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , being @xmath21 the phase space coordinates , and @xmath22 is glauber s displacement operator , @xmath23 . for the pascs , @xmath24 , the corresponding wigner function reads @xcite    @xmath25 the bivariate hermite polynomials @xmath26    for comparison , we have plotted in figure 1 the wigner function of the pascs having just one photon added and one photon subtracted [ equation ( [ wignerfunc ] ) with @xmath27 , together with the wigner function of the coherent state @xmath7 , given by @xmath28 .",
    "the wigner function of a coherent state is exactly a gaussian function , while the pascs s wigner function has a slight deformation as well as a negative part , a clear indication of the nonclassicality of the state . apart from being useful for identifying some features of quantum states , the wigner function",
    "may also be used to analyse the security of our protocol , as we are going to show below .",
    "the protocol works as follows : firstly , alice randomly chooses one of the four pascs ( for @xmath17 real ) : either @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( representing bit @xmath3 ) , or @xmath31 and @xmath32 , ( representing bit @xmath2 ) in the horizontal and vertical bases , respectively . the plots of the wigner functions corresponding to @xmath33 and @xmath34 in figure 2 give a clear picture of their distinguishability in phase space . in a second step alice sends a light signal prepared in the chosen state to bob , who randomly selects either the horizontal or the vertical basis and performs a homodyne detection on the received signal .",
    "bob also fixes a convenient value for the post - selection threshold , @xmath35 .",
    "we now denote @xmath36 the ( complex ) measurement variable corresponding to bob s measurement .",
    "if in a given measurement , he finds @xmath37 , bob assigns value 0 the bit ; if he finds @xmath38 , he assigns value 1 to the bit .",
    "otherwise , bob tells alice to neglect the corresponding bit .",
    "due to the transmission line losses ( imperfect channel ) , it is possible for an eavesdropper ( eve ) to intercept a fraction of the signal without being noticed by the legitimate users . to do that",
    ", eve uses an asymmetric beam - splitter of transmissivity @xmath39 and reflectivity @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "she keeps the reflected part of the beam ( the transmitted part is sent to bob via a lossless channel ) stored in a quantum memory and waits for the announcement of the measurement basis used by bob . for simplicity , in this security analysis",
    "we consider just the case in which the horizontal basis is announced , as the discussion is analogous for the vertical basis due to symmetry . to estimate the amount of gain of secret information per transmitted pulse @xmath42 it is necessary to derive an upper bound of the information leaked to eve when she splits the beam , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "a relevant quantity in the following derivation is the joint measurement probability , of bob obtaining the result @xmath43 and eve obtaining @xmath44 , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ( two - mode ) wigner function of the beam - splitter output @xcite , @xmath47 the @xmath48 signs refer to the pair of states we are considering for the security analysis , namely @xmath34 and @xmath33 . in the expression above , @xmath49 is the ( single mode ) wigner function [ equation ( [ wignerfunc ] ) ] of the pascs resulting from the addition of only one photon to a coherent state @xmath17 and subtraction of one photon from the resulting state . in the other port of the beam splitter",
    "we have the vacuum as input state , with wigner function @xmath50 .    because the pascs is not a coherent state , the two emerging beams from the beam - splitter are normally in an entangled state .",
    "thus , the joint probability distribution does not factorize , and the results of measurements made by bob , @xmath51 and eve , @xmath52 will be somehow correlated , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "this means that , if bob measures a relatively large value for his quadrature ( @xmath51 ) , eve is likely to measure a small value for hers ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "for instance , as seen in figure 3 : the maximum of @xmath53 occurs for @xmath54 , while @xmath55 .",
    "thus , if we increase the value of the post - selection threshold , the bit error rate on eve s side will also be increased .    after performing an ideal error correction and privacy amplification ,",
    "we may obtain a lower bound for the gain of secret information per transmitted pulse , @xmath42 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "firstly we define @xmath56 , the fraction of accepted bits @xmath57/2 $ ] , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 the shannon information @xmath60 is defined as @xmath61\\log_2 [ 1-\\delta(\\beta_r)]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath62 the amount of reduction of the raw key during the privacy amplification may be written as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the collision probability @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is eve s probability distribution conditioned to the fact that a pulse @xmath48 was sent and that bob accepted the bit in his post - selection .",
    "the collision probability plays a crucial role in the generation of the secret key , indicating by which amount the raw key must be reduced in order to eliminate eve s knowledge about it .",
    "the secret information @xmath42 is thus given by @xmath67 the results are shown in figure 4 .",
    "we have that the maximum of the surface representing the secret information is @xmath68 for the coherent state while @xmath69 for the pascs .",
    "i.e. , a percent improvement of about @xmath70 if the pascs are used in place of coherent states . moreover , we note that the pascs based protocol is more efficient for smaller values of the amplitude @xmath17 of the transmitted pulse , compared to the coherent state case , as seen in figure 4 .",
    "we remind that the pascs ( having just one photon added and one photon subtracted ) may be written as a superposition of the coherent state @xmath71 with a pacs , or @xmath72 ; thus , for small @xmath17 the contribution of the pacs ( non - gaussian state ) will also be very small , and the pascs will be close to a coherent ( gaussian ) state .",
    "nevertheless , it will still generate an entangled state after crossing the beam splitter .",
    "this will introduce anti - correlations between bob s and eve s measurements results ( see figure 3 ) , which favours the security of the pascs - based protocol , given that bob will be able to reduce eve s knowledge about the bits via post- selection . in figure 5",
    "we have plotted the secret bit rate @xmath42 as a function of transmission distance in a standard optical fibre for protocols using pascs and coherent states .",
    "we note that a pascs - based protocol outperforms a protocol based solely on coherent states , in the sense that a secret key could be generated at higher rates for a given distance .",
    "for complementarity , we discuss now a second ( intercept - resend ) attack performed by eve in which she splits the incoming pulses of light in a 50:50 beam - splitter and performs simultaneous quadrature measurements on the outgoing beams .",
    "she then tries to infer ( with probability @xmath73 ) the state of the signal sent by alice . here",
    "we consider the preparation of four possible states by alice , defined above as @xmath74 .",
    "if eve measures ( @xmath51 , @xmath75 ) , she will choose the state of the signal for which the associated joint probability distribution @xmath76 is maximum .",
    "for each state we have a corresponding region in phase space ( each one of area @xmath77 ) , i.e. , @xmath78 for @xmath34 ; @xmath79 for @xmath80 ; @xmath81 for @xmath33 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "generally speaking , the associated probability distributions are given by @xmath84 where @xmath46 is the ( two - mode ) wigner function of the beam - splitter output , @xmath85 as in reference @xcite we may define eve s success rate for the attack , @xmath73 .",
    "for instance , for a signal in the state @xmath34 , we have @xmath86 the efficiency of such an attack may then be evaluated .",
    "alice can make an optimization of the coherent amplitude @xmath17 given a fixed error rate @xmath87 for a lossless line and without the presence of eve . in figure 6 we have the optimum @xmath17 and the fraction of accepted bits , @xmath56 as a function of the post - selection threshold @xmath35 , for both coherent state and the pascs .",
    "we note that the value of optimum @xmath17 ( for each @xmath35 ) is in general smaller in the pascs based protocol , compared to the coherent state case .",
    "thus , even though the rate of accepted bits are smaller for the pascs , the probability of eve obtaining the correct bit becomes also smaller in this case , given that the optimum value of @xmath17 ( for a given value of threshold @xmath35 ) is smaller for the pascs . in figure 7",
    "we have a plot of @xmath73 as a function of @xmath35 , which clearly shows the advantage of the pascs over coherent states concerning the simultaneous quadrature measurement attack .",
    "we have shown that a continuous - variable protocol based on pascs having just one photon added and one photon subtracted is more efficient than a coherent state - based protocol , both of them using homodyne detection and post - selection as well as similar amplitudes for the coherent states employed .",
    "we have performed a security analysis based on the superior channel attack , and concluded that the pascs - based protocol would allow the legitimate users ( alice and bob ) to build a secret key with transmission rates higher than the ones obtained from coherent state based protocols .",
    "we have also analyzed the simultaneous quadrature measurement attack , and we have shown that eve s success rate is smaller if pascs are used in the place of coherent states .",
    "we would like to remark that this work is an attempt to explore the possibilities of utilization of non - gaussian states for quantum key distribution purposes , and this may open up new directions for continuous - variable protocols .",
    "we believe that implementations based on states such as the pascs could be considered as viable alternatives .",
