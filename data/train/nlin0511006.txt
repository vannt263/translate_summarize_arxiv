    "drag reduction in turbulent flows is a subject of technological importance and of significant basic interest .",
    "as is well known , drag reduction can be achieved using a number of additives , including flexible polymers , rod - like polymers and fibers , surfactants , and bubbles @xcite . while the subject of drag reduction by polymers had seen rapid theoretical progress in the last few years @xcite the understanding of drag reduction by bubbles lags behind . for practical applications in the shipping industry",
    "the use of polymers is out of the question for economic and environmental reasons , but air bubbles are potentially very attractive .",
    "the theory of drag reduction by small concentrations of minute bubbles is relatively straightforward , since under such conditions the bubbles only renormalize the density and the viscosity of the fluid , and a one - fluid model suffices to describe the dynamics @xcite . the fluid remains incompressible , and the equations of motion are basically the same as for a newtonian fluid with renormalized properties .",
    "the amount of drag reduction under such conditions is however limited .",
    "but when the bubbles increase in size , the one - fluid model loses its validity since the bubbles become dynamical in the sense that they are no longer lagrangian particles , their velocity is no longer the fluid velocity at their center , and they begin to fluctuate under the influence of local pressure variations .",
    "the fluctuations of the bubbles are of two types : 1 ) the bubbles are no longer spherical , distorting their shape according to the pressure variations , and 2 ) the bubbles can oscillate _ radially _ ( keeping their spherical shape ) due to the commpressiblity of the gas inside the bubble .",
    "the first effect was studied numerically using the  front tracking \" algorithm in ref  @xcite .",
    "however , the results indicate either a drag enhancement , or a limited and transient drag reduction .",
    "this leads one to study the possibility of explaining bubbly drag reduction by bubble oscillations .",
    "indeed , a theoretical model proposed by legner @xcite successfully explained the bubbly drag reduction by modifying the turbulent viscosity in the bubbly flow by the bulk viscosity of the bubbles .",
    "while the bulk viscosity is important only when the bubbles are compressible , it is important and interesting to see how and why it affects the charactistics of the flow .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the drag reduction by bubbles when bubble oscillations are dominant .",
    "finally we compare our finding with the results in ref  @xcite , showing that a nonphysical aspect of that theory is removed , while a good agreement with experiment is retained .    in our thinking",
    "we were influenced by two main findings , one experimental and the other simulational .",
    "the experiment @xcite established the importance of bubble dynamics in effecting drag reduction .",
    "the same turbulent flow was set up once in the presence of bubbles and once in the presence of glass spheres whose density was smaller than that of the ambient fluid .",
    "while bubbles effected drag reduction for sufficiently high reynolds number , the glass spheres enhanced the drag . in the simulation @xcite it was demonstrated that the drag reduction by the bubbles is connected in an intimate way to the effective compressibility of the mixture .",
    "( the fluid by itself was taken as incompressible in the simulation ) .",
    "these two observations , in addition to the experiments @xcite will be at the back of our mind in developing the theory , with the final elucidation of all these observations in the last sections of this paper .",
    "[ aveq ] we present the average ( field ) equations for fluids laden with bubbles .",
    "this theory follows verbatim earlier work @xcite and it is limited to rather small bubbles ( of the order of the kolmogorov scale ) and to potential flows . in sect .",
    "[ weber ] we employ the theory to find out at which reynolds and weber numbers the bubbles interact sufficiently strongly with the fluid to change significantly the stress tensor beyond simple viscosity renormalization . in sect .",
    "[ bal ] we study the balance equation for momentum and energy in the turbulent boundary layer .",
    "this leads to the main section of this paper , sect .",
    "[ drag ] which presents the predictions of the theory regarding drag reduction by bubbles .",
    "the oscillations of the bubbles at sufficiently high weber numbers are shown to be an important physical reason for the phenomenon .",
    "a summary and discussion are presented in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "a newtonian fluid with density @xmath0 is laden with bubbles of density @xmath1 , and radius @xmath2 which is much smaller than the outer scale of turbulence @xmath3 .",
    "the volume fraction of bubbles @xmath4 is taken sufficiently small such that the direct interactions between bubbles can be neglected . in writing the governing equations for the bubbly flow",
    "we will assume that the length scales of interest are larger than the bubble radius .",
    "later we will distinguish however between the case of microbubbles whose radius is smaller than the kolmogorov scale @xmath5 and bubbles whose radius is of the order of @xmath5 or slightly larger . for length scales larger than the bubbles one writes  @xcite :    * _ equation of motion for each bubble _ @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dynamical viscosity of the neat fluid . in this equation",
    "the force acting on the bubble is only approximate , since we neglect gravity , the lift force and the add - mass force due bubble oscillations .",
    "we include only the viscous force and the add - mass force due to bubble acceleration , and we will show that this is sufficient for enhancing the drag reduction by the bubble dynamics . it can be argued that adding the other forces does not change things qualitatively . * _ equation of motion for the carrier fluid _ @xmath8 * _ continuity equation _",
    "@xmath9    in these equations ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 is the velocity of the carrier fluid and the bubble respectively , and @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the force and the stress caused by the disturbance of the flow due to the bubbles , the lagrangian derivatives are defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the density of the bubble is usually much smaller than the fluid , @xmath1 is taken to be 0 .",
    "combining ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we have @xmath17 note that the term containing @xmath13 disappears in the last equation because of the cancellation of action and reaction forces .",
    "the bubbles affect the flow in two ways :    * changing the effective density of the fluid ; * introducing an additional stress tensor @xmath14 to the fluid velocity equation ( [ basic ] ) .",
    "the expression used for @xmath18 is extremely important for the discussion at hand .",
    "it is commonly accepted that the stress tensor is affected by three factors : @xmath19 in this equation @xmath20 is the viscous stress tensor , written as : @xmath21 for very small bubbles ( micro - bubbles ) of very small density this is the only significant contribution in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) . when this is the case the bubble contribution to the stress tensor can be combined with @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) , resulting in the effective viscosity given by[muef ] _ eff = ( 1 + 52 c )  .the study of drag reduction under this renormalization of the viscosity and the density was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result that drag reduction can be obtained by putting the bubbles out of the viscous sub - layer and not too far from the wall .",
    "the amount of drag reduction is however rather limited in such circumstances .    the other two contributions in eq .",
    "( [ tau ] ) are the concern of the present paper .",
    "the component @xmath23 is non zero only when the bubble is not a lagrangian particle , having a relative velocity @xmath24 with respect to the fluid ; then the bubble radius is changing in time .",
    "explicitly @xcite : @xmath25{{{\\bm{i}}}}\\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\frac{\\rho}{20 } ( { { { \\bm{w}}}}-{{\\bm{u } } } ) (    { { { \\bm{w}}}}-{{\\bm{u } } } ) \\ . \\label{tau_r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last contribution @xmath26 is sensitive to the change in pressure of the fluid due to the bubbles .",
    "it reads @xcite : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the pressure of the fluid without bubbles , @xmath29 is the normal unit vector to the bubble surface , and d@xmath30 is the area differential .",
    "the relation of this expression to the relative velocity and to the bubble dynamics calls for a calculation , which in general is rather difficult .",
    "such a calculation was achieved explicitly only for potential flows , with the final result  @xcite : @xmath31 { { { \\bm{i } } } } \\nonumber   \\\\ & & - \\frac{9\\rho}{20 } ( { { { \\bm{w}}}}-{{\\bm{u } } } ) (   { { { \\bm{w}}}}-{{\\bm{u}}})\\ . \\label{taus}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the relative importance of the three contributions @xmath20 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 depends on the reynolds number and on @xmath34 . to study this question",
    "represent eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) as follows @xmath35 consider first the case of small bubble size , @xmath36 , and small reynolds numbers . in this case",
    "the viscous term on the rhs is dominant , and the difference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 can not be large .",
    "the bubbles behave essentially as lagrangian tracers . on the other hand , at high values of re and for larger bubbles , @xmath37 , the term @xmath38 should be re - interpreted on the scale of the bubble as [ mumbo ] p & & + & = &  , where @xmath39 is the location of the bubble .",
    "the second line in eq .",
    "( [ mumbo ] ) follows from bernouli s equation .",
    "when the size of the bubble becomes of the order of the kolmogorov scale or larger , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the r.m.s . of the turbulent velocity .",
    "at this point we can ask what is the value of the reynolds number for which the viscous term is no longer dominant , allowing for significant fluctuations in @xmath42 .",
    "this happens when the terms in eq .",
    "( [ beq2 ] ) are comparable , i.e. when @xmath43 this equation contains an important prediction for experiments .",
    "it means that the fluctuations in the relative velocity of the bubble with respect to fluid is of the order of the outer fluid velocity when @xmath44 is larger than @xmath45 . in most experiments , @xmath46 and it is therefore sufficient to reach @xmath47 for @xmath48 to be of the order of @xmath41 . note that this is precisely the result of the experiment @xcite .",
    "this discussion has consequences for the bubble dynamics and oscillations . at small re , @xmath24 is small and @xmath49 .",
    "then the equation of the mixture becomes : @xmath50 with @xmath51 meaning that only the effective density and viscosity are changed , as is usually assumed in numerical simulations of  point \" bubbles @xcite . on the other hand , when re is large @xmath52 is comparable to @xmath41 .",
    "this will affect the stress tensor on scales larger than the bubble size via @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the surface tension .",
    "this equation tells us that the radial oscillations of the bubbles are excited by the relative velocity @xmath24 . when @xmath55 , then @xmath56 and so @xmath2 is a constant .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 is small if @xmath24 is small .",
    "the strength of the oscillation can be characterised by the weber number @xmath58    as a summary , the additional stress tensor @xmath59 in the basic eq .",

    "the relative importance of the various terms in @xmath63 depends on the values of re and we .",
    "if we is sufficiently large , there will be a large change in the diagonal part of @xmath64 . in the following section",
    "we show that this can be crucial for drag reduction .",
    "at this point we apply the formalism detailed above to the question of drag reduction by bubbles in a stationary turbulent boundary layer with plain geometry . this can be a pressure driven turbulent channel flow or a plain couette flow , which is close to the circular couette flow realized in  @xcite .",
    "let the smallest geometric scale be @xmath65 ( for example the channel height in a channel flow ) , the unit vector in the streamwise and spanwise directions be @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , and the distance to the nearest wall be @xmath68 .",
    "the velocity @xmath69 has only one mean component , denoted by @xmath70 , that depends only on @xmath71 : @xmath72 denoting turbulent velocity fluctuations ( with zero mean ) by @xmath73 we have the reynolds decomposition of the velocity field to its mean and fluctuating part : @xmath74 long time averages are denoted by @xmath75 .",
    "having dynamical equations ( [ basic ] ) and ( [ tau1 ] ) , we can consider the effect of the bubbles on the statistics of turbulent channel flow .",
    "for this goal we shall use a simple stress model of planar turbulent flow .",
    "a similar model was successfully used in the context of drag reduction by polymeric additives  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the balance equations of mechanical momentum , which we consider in the next sec .",

    "( [ basic ] ) we derive the exact equation for the momentum balance by averaging and integrating in the usual way , and find for @xmath68 : @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the momentum flux toward the wall . in a channel flow @xmath78 ,",

    "( [ mombal ] ) is the usual equation satisfied by newtonian fluids .    to expose the consequences of the bubbles we notice that the diagonal part of the bubble stress tensor @xmath63 [ the first line in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ tau1 ] ) ] does not contribute to eq .",
    "( [ mombal ] ) . the @xmath81 component of the off - diagonal part of @xmath63 is given by the 2nd line in eq .",
    "( [ tau1 ] ) .",
    "define the dimensionless ratio @xmath82 for later purposes it is important to assess the size and sign of @xmath83 . for small values of re , @xmath83 is small according to eq .",
    "( [ estimate ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , it was argued in @xcite that for large re the fluctuating part of @xmath11 is closely related to the fluctuating part of @xmath84 .",
    "the relation is @xmath85 if we accept this argument verbatim this would imply that @xmath86 and is positive definite , as we indeed assume bellow . with this definition we can simplify the appearance of eq .",
    "( [ mombal ] ) : @xmath87 with @xmath88 defined by eq .",
    "( [ muef ] ) .",
    "below we consider the high re limit , and accordingly can neglect the first term on the rhs .",
    "next , we consider the balance of turbulent energy in the log - layer . in this region , the production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy is almost balanced .",
    "the production can be calculated exactly , @xmath89 .",
    "the dissipation of the turbulent energy is modelled by the energy flux which is the kinetic energy @xmath90 divided by the typical eddy turn over time at a distance @xmath71 from the wall , which is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a dimensionless number of the order of unity .",
    "thus the flux is written as @xmath93 .",
    "the extra dissipation due to the bubble is @xmath94 where @xmath95 . in summary ,",
    "the turbulent energy balance equation is then written as : @xmath96 as usual , the energy and momentum balance equations do not close the problem , and we need an additional relation between the objects of the theory . for newtonian fluids it is know that in the log - layer @xmath97 and @xmath98 are proportional to each other [ wk]@xmath99 for the problem of drag reduction by polymers this ratio is also some constant @xmath100 ( in the maximum drag reduction regime ) .",
    "for the bubbly flow , we define @xmath101 in the same manner : @xmath102 clearly , @xmath103 and for small @xmath4 ( noninteracting bubbles ) @xmath104 .",
    "it was reported in  @xcite that @xmath101 is slightly smaller than its newtonian counterpart ; we therefore write[wkbab]cb^2=cn^2(1- c ) , with a positive coefficient @xmath105 of the order of unity .",
    "we are not aware of direct measurements of this form in bubbly flows , but it appears natural to assume that the parameter @xmath105 is @xmath71-independent in the turbulent log - law region .",
    "we note that the cauchy - schwartz inequality can be used to prove that @xmath106 , meaning that all the ratios @xmath107 .",
    "in this section we argue that bubble oscillations are crucial in enhancing the effect of drag reduction .",
    "this conclusion is in line with the experimental observation of @xcite where bubbles and glass spheres were used under similar experimental conditions .",
    "evidently , bubble deformations can lead to the compressibility of the bubbly mixture .",
    "this is in agreement with the simulation of @xcite where a strong correlation between compressibility and drag reduction were found .    to make the point clear we start with the analysis of the energy balance equation ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the additional stress tensor @xmath108 has a diagonal and an off diagonal part .",
    "the off - diagonal part has a viscous part that is negligible for high re .",
    "the other term can be evaluated using the estimate ( [ estimate ] ) , leading to the contribution @xmath109 the expression on the rhs is nothing but the spatial turbulent energy flux which is known to be very small in the log - layer compared to the production term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we will therefore neglect the off - diagonal part of the stress tensor in the energy equation .",
    "the analysis of the diagonal part of the stress depends on the issue of bubble oscillations and we therefore discuss separately oscillating bubbles and rigid spheres .",
    "consider first situations in which @xmath110 .",
    "this is the case for bubbles at small we , or when the bubbles are replaced by some particles which are less dense than neat fluid @xcite . when the volume of the bubbles is fixed , the incompressibility condition for the newtonian fluid is unchanged , and @xmath111 .",
    "the diagonal part of @xmath18 , due to the incompressibility condition @xmath111 , has no contribution to @xmath112 .",
    "the energy balance equation is then unchanged compared to the newtonian fluid .",
    "the momentum balance equation is nevertheless affected by the bubbles .",
    "putting ( [ wk ] ) into ( [ energy ] ) , we have @xmath113 to assess the amount of drag reduction we will consider an experiment @xcite in which the velocity profile ( and thus @xmath114 ) is maintained fixed .",
    "drag reduction is then measured by the reduction in the momentum flux @xmath77 .",
    "we then have @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the von - karman constant .",
    "if there are no bubbles ( @xmath80 ) , the newtonian momentum flux @xmath117 reads @xmath118 the percentage of drag reduction can be defined as & = & = 1- + [ dr ] & & @xmath119 c  .",
    "here we assumed that @xmath120 . at small re , @xmath121 and",
    "the amount of drag reduction increases linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "if re is very large we expect @xmath122 , and then the drag is _",
    "enhanced_. this result is in pleasing agreement with the experimental data in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the addition of glass beads with density less than water caused drag _ reduction _ when re is small , whereas at re  @xmath123 , the drag was slightly _",
    "enhanced_.      if the value of we is sufficiently large such that @xmath124 , the velocity field is no longer divergenceless . to see how this affects the energy equation we consider a single bubble with volume @xmath125 . from the continuity equation : @xmath126 assumed that the bubble is small enough such that the velocity field does not change much on the scale of @xmath2 , then we have @xmath127 therefore , the last term in ( [ req ] ) can be approximated as @xmath128 next we substitute eq .",
    "( [ req ] ) into eq .",

    "( [ uu ] ) we find @xmath135 the term @xmath136 is of the same form as the usual dissipation term @xmath137 and therefore we write this as : @xmath138 where @xmath30 is an empirical constant .",
    "finally , the energy equation becomes @xmath139    as before , we specialize the situation to an experiment in which @xmath114 is constant , and compute the momentum flux @xmath140 the degree of drag reduction is then @xmath141 note that @xmath30 is an unknown parameter that should depend on @xmath142 , and so its value is different in different experiments . the percentage of drag reduction for various values of @xmath30 are shown in fig . 1 where we chose @xmath143 and for simplicity we estimate @xmath144 .",
    "one sees that for @xmath143 and @xmath145 ( where the latter is associated with rigid bubbles ) , we only find drag enhancement . for small value of @xmath30 , or small amplitudes of oscillations , small concentrations of bubbles lead ( for @xmath143 ) to drag enhancement , but upon increasing the concentration we find modest drag reduction .",
    "larger values of @xmath30 lead to considerably large degrees of drag reduction . for @xmath146",
    ", the result agrees reasonably with legner s model which predicts @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "note that according to legner , there should be considerable drag enhancement when @xmath80 .",

    "this is the best fit to the experimental results which are reported in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of this study is that bubble oscillations can contribute decisively to drag reduction by bubbles in turbulent flows . in agreement with the experimental findings of @xcite",
    ", we find that rigid bubbles tend to drag enhance , and the introduction of oscillations whose amplitude is measured by the parameter @xmath30 ( fig.1 ) increases the efficacy of drag reduction .",
    "it is also important to recognize that bubble oscillations go hand - in - hand with the compressibility @xmath150 . in this sense",
    "we are in agreement with the proposition of @xcite that drag reduction by bubbles is caused by the compressibility .",
    "there is a difference , however : in @xcite the flow is free ( having only one wall ) whereas in our case we have a channel in mind .",
    "the mechanism of @xcite can not appear in our case .",
    "on the other hand @xcite does not allow for bubble oscillations .",
    "the bottom line is that in both cases the bubble dynamics leads to the existence of compressibility , and the latter contributes to the drag reduction .",
    "one drawback of the present study is that the bubble concentration is taken uniform in the flow . in reality",
    "a profile of bubble concentration may lead to even stronger drag reduction if placed correctly with respect to the wall .",
    "a consistent study of this possibility calls for the consideration of buoyancy and the self - consistent solution of the bubble concentration profile .",
