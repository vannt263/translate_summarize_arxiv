    "a detailed understanding of the strong interaction dynamics on the symmetries of qcd is a fundamental aim of hadron physics . at high energies the qcd serves as a reliable theory whereas at low energies the non ",
    "perturbative qcd phenomena must be investigated . here",
    "calculations are performed in an effective field theory of hadrons represented by the chiral effective lagrangian , a theory of goldstone bosons coupled to the octet of baryons and vector mesons .",
    "the qcd lagrange function is written as : @xmath1 in principle , @xmath2 describes the column vector of the quarks @xmath3 with each of them represented by a spinor , identical to the dirac equation for spin@xmath4 electrons . at energies in the few gev",
    "range only the first three quarks are of any relevance , @xmath5 represents the diagonal of the matrix for the quark current masses .    data of high quality and precision on hadronic processes at low and intermediate momenta are necessary in order to verify the systematic low energy expansion of the chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6 ) , which has already enforced an important insight into the structure and dynamics of nucleons and mesons  @xcite .",
    "it is known that the current masses of the lightest three quarks are significantly smaller than the typical hadronic energy scale , represented by the proton mass of @xmath7 .",
    "this is the reason why in first order the quark masses of the light quarks are neglected in theoretical considerations and the spin@xmath4 fields can be separated into two independent left and right  handed parts , reflected by the chiral symmetry .",
    "the qcd lagrangian separates into two identical images :    @xmath8 = l_{qcd}\\;[\\bar q_{left } , q_{left } ] +    l_{qcd}\\;[\\bar q_{right } , q_{right}].\\ ] ]    left  handed quarks do not communicate with right  handed quarks and _ vice versa_. there is no lorentz transformation which can change the handedness of a mass  less quark or particle .",
    "this symmetry of the lagrange function is not the symmetry of the spectrum of the particles since otherwise each hadron should have a partner of equal mass but inverted parity .",
    "consequently there would be a second proton with negative parity which does not exist .",
    "there are no parity  doublets in the spectrum of the strong interacting particles and therefore the symmetry is spontaneously broken . due to this breaking the mass  less so  called goldstone bosons , the pseudoscalar @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons appear .",
    "the restriction of the interaction of these particles among each other and with other hadrons can be used to analyze consequences of the chiral symmetry and its breaking in the framework of an effective field theory .",
    "in reality the lightest hadrons  the goldstone bosons  are by no means mass  less , which can be understood by an explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry including a term for the quark masses . for each massive fermion there",
    "exists a lorentz transformation which transforms a left  handed to a right  handed field .",
    "the effect of this explicit breaking now can be treated perturbatively since the masses of the light quarks are much smaller than the typical hadronic mass .",
    "predicting the low  energy properties of nuclear and particle physics , @xmath6 plays an important role in understanding hadron physics in the non  perturbative regime .",
    "therefore it is very important to know the properties of the mesons , their structure and interaction in the hadronic environment .    the physics program at the medium energy hadron accelerators was and is focusing on studies of the production and the decay of light mesons and baryon resonances and the conservation or violation of symmetries .",
    "following this sequence we will present and discuss production of mesons and meson pairs at threshold with the questions depicted by the interaction view of figure  [ meson_exchange ]  @xcite where in the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( @xmath12 ) scattering a meson @xmath13 is created in a one  boson  exchange model . for the particular case",
    "the questions have to be answered : how is the distortion of the incident @xmath12 waves ( isi ) included , which mesons contribute to the exchange process , is there an intermediate baryon resonance , how significant are rescattering contributions of the exchange mesons and what is a reasonable treatment of the @xmath12 and @xmath14 final state interactions ( fsi ) ? especially for the @xmath12interaction",
    "the fsi is crucial because of the nearby poles in the s  wave amplitudes corresponding to the deuteron bound state in the @xmath15 channel or the @xmath16 virtual state  @xcite .",
    "these poles and the phase ",
    "space factors tend to determine much of the energy dependence of the total cross section for meson production .",
    "furthermore , in any region where these poles dominate , it is possible to link quantitatively meson production in cases where the two nucleons emerge separately or as a bound deuteron state .    even at threshold",
    "the reaction mechanism of the basic process for the interrelation between real pions and virtual exchange meson currents as for instance in the pion production ( @xmath17 ) is still not fully understood . though first data suggested that s  wave pions were produced in a heavy ",
    "meson  exchange process , later measurements resulted in an interpretation of an interference among transition amplitudes as ss , ps , pp , sd and ds , where the capital letter indicates the @xmath12 final state wave and the small letter the angular momentum between the two nucleons and the meson produced .",
    "in addition , it has been concluded that for higher partial waves @xmath9 exchange rather than a heavier meson exchange is more significant .",
    "especially the pion  nucleon interaction went through several stages of increasing sensitivity for tests of nuclear theory .",
    "as indicated above more than a decade after the initial work  @xcite only in the sixties explicit calculations on cross sections of the @xmath18 transitions were possible  @xcite which , however , failed the total cross section  @xcite by a factor of five .",
    "after further theoretical developments , see e.g.  reference  @xcite , only recently detailed calculations were provided within the jlich meson exchange model  @xcite including transitions in the threshold region beyond @xmath19 and predicting analyzing powers and spin correlation coefficients making use of i ) the basic diagrams , ii ) final state interactions , iii ) off  shell effects , iv ) the exchange of heavier mesons and v ) influences of intermediate excitation of the @xmath20 resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "the jlich model does not account for quark degrees of freedom i.e.  calculations within the framework of the @xmath6 which , in fact , predict cross sections too small  @xcite compared to experiments.the heavier the meson produced in nucleon ",
    "nucleon scattering the larger the momentum transfers and thus in such processes the short  range parts of the production operators are tested .",
    "double meson production processes with both mesons being either identical ( e.g.  @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) or different ( e.g.  @xmath23 ) are in principle similar to the single ones , however , the possibly associated baryon resonances as intermediate states differ significantly .",
    "for instance , the two  pion production very likely is dominated by either the @xmath24 @xmath25 resonance  via an effective @xmath26 exchange giving information of a scalar meson excitation of the @xmath24 @xmath25 resonance  or the simultaneously excited @xmath27 @xmath28 resonances . due to selection rules here the choice of definite quantum numbers in the initial and final state",
    "might help to sort out the reaction mechanism .    in any case ,",
    "a large amount of the knowledge about the @xmath9@xmath9 interaction has been obtained by the @xmath29 reaction , whereas data employing proton beams just start to come .",
    "as long as only s  wave processes are involved , which is the privilege of threshold production studies , scattering length and effective range approaches are used to describe the interaction sign and strength . in case of strong attractive interactions a distinction between the final state scattering and the formation of a baryonic resonance leading to bound or quasi ",
    "bound states can not be made uniquely .",
    "such investigation will be presented.isospin violation or charge symmetry breaking processes are a topical and interesting field of threshold production physics .",
    "the essential contribution to isospin breaking is the possible @xmath30 mixing .",
    "therefore experiments around the @xmath11 threshold as e.g.  @xmath31 or @xmath32 should identify the @xmath30 mixing angle which in turn might give hints to the mass difference of the up and down quarks .",
    "threshold production experiments are characterized by excess energies which are small compared to the produced masses   discussed in this article , we will principally refer to experimental results and theoretical investigations covering excess energies up to @xmath33 ( the @xmath9mass ) in excess of the respective thresholds . ] .",
    "consequently , in fixed target experiments the momenta of the final state particles transverse with respect to the direction of the incoming beam are small compared to the longitudinal components .",
    "thus , ejectiles are confined to a narrow forward cone in the laboratory system around the centre  of  mass movement and  close  to  threshold  an experimental acceptance covering the full solid angle is feasible with comparatively small dedicated detector arrangements .",
    "small relative momenta in the final state effectively limit the number of partial waves contributing , simplifying the theoretical interpretation of experimental results .",
    "it should be noted , that already three ",
    "body final states require  in principle  a three  body faddeev like approach , which has not been accomplished so far  @xcite .",
    "however , as first described by watson  @xcite , with two strongly interacting particles in the final state , the energy dependence of the total cross section close  to  threshold is essentially determined by the ( three  body ) phase  space and the energy dependence of the on  shell final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "due to small relative velocities fsi effects are inherent to the experimental observables .",
    "thus , the interpretation of data in terms of reaction dynamics requires a correct treatment of both initial   regime , even for proton  proton scattering no reliable model exists to allow a consistent evaluation of the initial state interaction  @xcite . ]",

    "high quality data on the meson ( @xmath48 ) production at threshold have been and are being produced at the hadronic beam cooler rings using the baryon number @xmath49 systems ( essentially @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "at least equally important are studies with hadronic interactions in the @xmath52 sector",
    ". however , most measurements with @xmath9 or @xmath10beams used bubble chamber techniques which naturally suffer from very poor statistics .",
    "accurate investigations of differential cross sections for meson production from the initial @xmath9 plus proton or @xmath10 plus proton systems are needed at several momenta to study the s and p  wave dynamics and their interplay .",
    "there are several indications that as intermediate states both the @xmath53 resonance and the @xmath54 quasi  bound state  followed by a final state interaction leading to nucleon and meson  are essential and could be investigated best via the @xmath52 sector .    until now ,",
    "most of the data for threshold meson production were observed with proton beams .",
    "the use of antiprotons has contributed considerably to the knowledge of the meson spectroscopy up to serious candidates for glueballs and exotic hybrids but is still suffering from the lack of unique interpretations .    a comparison of the meson production in the fundamental process to productions on heavier nucleons would give constraints to eliminate uncertainties in the basic interactions . as outlined by w.  weise and u.g .",
    "meiner  @xcite , precise measurements of such processes set the necessary constraints for the effective lagrangian of low  energy qcd with strange quarks .",
    "its detailed knowledge has impacts on several other important issues , such as the strange quark content of the nucleon .",
    "though in the present article we will restrict ourselves to hadron induced reactions , in general induced with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath9 and @xmath57beams , investigations on the structure of the nucleon as seen with leptons should at least be mentioned  @xcite .",
    "the use of leptonic interactions via photon or electroweak boson exchanges has the attraction of combining a weakly interacting particle of well controlled energy momentum transfer with the complex multi particle system containing charged constituents .",
    "photoproduction provides a crucial complementary information compared to hadronic processes , since they are characterized by the electromagnetic probe as a virtual vector meson or an @xmath58 fluctuation and as such are a powerful source of spin1 states .",
    "the well proven perturbative methods allow us to define a hierarchy of operators which , at least in principle , can be extracted separately .",
    "perturbative methods finally allow to overcome one of the limitations of the electroweak interaction , that is the access to gluon distributions .",
    "in fact the strong interaction in the limit of hard scales is becoming a probe for the soft region .",
    "all this can be complemented by the addition of the spin and flavour degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "cross sections are very small in the threshold region down to eight orders of magnitude compared to the total yield . due to the rapid growth of the phase ",
    "space volume the total cross section of the meson production reactions increases by orders of magnitudes in a few mev range of excess energy .",

    "an electron beam is used for exciting particular nuclear resonances and observing their individual decay modes .      the interaction of hadrons  being the reflection of the strong force acting between their constituents",
    " delivers indirect information about their structure and the strong interaction itself . in the frame of the optical potential model",
    "the hadronic interaction can be expressed in terms of phase  shifts , which in turn are described by the scattering length and effective range parameters .",
    "these are quite well known for the low  energy nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction  @xcite yet they are still poorly established in case of meson  nucleon or even meson  meson interactions .",
    "this is partly due to the absorption of mesons when scattering on a baryon . to account for this effect",
    "the scattering length becomes a complex quantity where the imaginary part  e.g.  in case of the nucleon@xmath11 interaction  describes the @xmath63 and @xmath64 processes .",
    "moreover , the short life ",
    "time of all _ neutral _ ground state mesons prohibits their utilization as secondary beams and therefore the study of their interaction with hadrons is accessible only via observations of their influence on the cross section of the reactions in which they were produced ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "when created close to the kinematical threshold with the relative kinetic energy being in the order of a few mev , the final state particles remain much longer in the range of the strong interaction than the typical life ",
    "time of @xmath66 or @xmath20 baryon resonances with @xmath67 and hence they can easily experience a mutual interaction before escaping the area of an influence of the hadronic force . this  as introduced by watson  @xcite  final state interaction ( fsi ) may significantly modify both the original distributions of relative momenta of the outgoing reaction products and the magnitude of the production cross section . though it is easy to understand that the fsi changes the distributions of the differential cross sections it is rather difficult to cope for the influences on the magnitude of the total reaction rate , since one tends to separate the primary production from the final state interaction in space as well as in time  @xcite .",
    "considering the primary production as a separate process it is well worth trying to understand the phenomenon qualitatively .",
    "if there were no final state interactions the total cross section would be fully determined by the kinematically available phase  space volume , @xmath68 , where each interval is populated with a probability governed by the primary production amplitude only : @xmath69 the approximation in the equation results from the assumption that @xmath70 in a few mev range above the production threshold  @xcite .",
    "f denotes the flux factor of the colliding particles .    in the classical picture",
    "we might imagine that the reaction particles are created together with their appropriate force field and when escaping the interaction region they acquire a potential energy increasing or decreasing their kinetic energy depending whether the interaction is repulsive or attractive . for an attractive interaction",
    "they could be created also in those phase ",
    "space partitions which are not available for non  interacting particles and subsequently be `` pulled down '' to the energetically allowed regions by final state interaction .",
    "the temporary growth of the primary production phase  space would than increase the reaction rate .",
    "contrary , in case of a repulsive interaction the particles must be produced in the lower phase ",
    "space volume since leaving the interaction area they will acquire additional kinetic energy .",
    "the reduction of the total cross section , for example in case of the repulsive coulomb force , can easily be understood when considering the production in a coordinate space of point ",
    "like objects . here",
    " in contrast to non  interactive particles  a strongly repulsive object can not be produced at appropriately small distances since their later acceleration would lead to the breaking of the energy conservation and thus the space available to primary production is reduced .",
    "one can also argue relativistically that the primary mechanism creates the particles off the mass shell and subsequently they are lifted onto the mass shell by the final state interaction .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ dalitz_phasespace ] ( left ) depicts the boundary of the dalitz plot in case of the @xmath71 reaction calculated at the total centre  of  mass energy @xmath72 exceeding by @xmath73 the threshold energy .",
    "the area surrounded by that curve is a direct measure of the kinematically available phase ",
    "space volume .",
    "the dotted line shows the    corresponding plot at the moment of the primary creation if the mass of each particle was reduced by @xmath74 , demonstrating that now the available phase ",
    "space grows significantly .",
    "indeed , as shall be inferred from the experimental results presented in subsequent sections , at excess energies of a few mev above threshold , the mutual interaction among the outgoing particles enhances drastically  by more than an order of magnitude  the total cross section and modifies appreciably the occupation of the phase  space .",
    "figure  [ dalitz_phasespace ] ( right ) indicates the phase  space distribution expected for the @xmath75 system at an excess energy of @xmath76 , assuming a homogeneous primary production and taking into account the s  wave interaction between the protons .",
    "the proton  proton fsi modifies the homogeneous dalitz plot distribution of `` non  interacting particles '' , enhancing its population at a region where the protons have small relative momenta .",
    "the interaction of the proton@xmath11 system would manifest itself at low invariant masses @xmath77 corresponding to small relative momenta between the proton and the @xmath11 meson .",
    "such effects observed in the experiments are presented in section  [ smpinns ] .    at the vicinity of the threshold ,",
    "relative angular momenta larger than @xmath78 will not play any role due to the short range of the strong interaction and small relative momenta of the produced particles .",
    "it can be inferred from parity and angular momentum conservation laws that the production of an @xmath37@xmath37@xmath79 system ( for pseudoscalar or vector mesons ) in relative s ",
    "waves may only occur if the nucleons collide in p  wave .",
    "thus at threshold the transition @xmath80 is the only possible one , with capital letters denoting the angular momentum between nucleons and the small letter for the meson angular momentum with respect to the pair of nucleons .",
    "an interaction of the nucleons in the entrance channel influences the production process appreciably  @xcite , similarly as that described above between the outgoing particles . for example",
    ", for @xmath11 production in the @xmath81 reaction the initial state interaction ( isi ) reduces the total cross section by about a factor of 35  @xcite due to the repulsive proton ",
    "proton @xmath82wave potential .",
    "this factor keeps constant in the range of a few tens of mev  @xcite and hence , does not influence the energy dependence of the total cross section of the meson production , which remains predominantly determined by the final state interaction .",
    "in particular , the dominant s  wave nucleon ",
    "nucleon final state interaction is by far stronger than any of the low  energy meson  nucleon ones , with the only exception of the proton@xmath83 fsi  ( see section  [ mwhs ] ) .",
    "the effect of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon fsi diminishes with increasing excess energy since it significantly influences only that partition of the phase  space at which the nucleons have small relative momenta . whereas this fraction keeps constant , the full volume of the phase ",
    "space grows rapidly : an increase of the excess energy from @xmath84 to @xmath85 corresponds to a growth of @xmath68 by more than three orders of magnitude  @xcite . as a result the s  wave nucleon ",
    "nucleon fsi is of less importance for higher excess energies where it affects a small fraction of the available phase ",
    "space volume only . a more quantitative discussion about the influence of the isi and fsi effects at close  to  threshold production cross sections will be presented in section  [ mwhs ] .",
    "investigations of the production of mesons and their interactions with nucleons are based on measurements determining the total and differential production cross sections and their dependence on the energy of the interacting nucleons . therefore , to enable a quantitative discussion on the mechanisms leading to the transformation of the energy  of  motion of nucleons into matter in the form of mesons let us recall the formula of the reaction cross section . in case of the @xmath86 process  with the four  momenta of the colliding nucleons denoted by @xmath87 and @xmath88 and with @xmath89 particles in the exit channel  this reads : @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the square of the lorentz ",
    "invariant spin averaged matrix element describing the probability to create two nucleons and a meson with four  momenta of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation as well as the on  shellness of the created particles is ensured by the dirac@xmath94 and the heaviside@xmath95 functions .",
    "the formula holds also for @xmath96 .",
    "the total cross section is then defined as an integral of the probabilities to populate a given phase ",
    "space interval over the whole kinematically available range  determined by energy and momentum conservation  normalized to the flux factor f of the colliding nucleons . in the case of",
    "non  interacting final state particles the matrix element close to threshold @xmath91 , is nearly constant  @xcite and hence the allowed phase  space volume , @xmath68 , is the decisive quantity which governs the growth of the cross section with increasing excess energy q. the latter  defined as the total kinetic energy  is shared among the outgoing particles in the reaction centre  of  mass frame  : @xmath97 where @xmath98 ) , the total reaction energy @xmath99 amounts to : @xmath100 . before writing explicitly the formula for @xmath68 let us introduce the kinematical triangle function @xmath101 defined as  @xcite : @xmath102 which enables the expression of many useful kinematical variables in a very compact and lorentz  invariant form .",
    "in particular , the momenta of particle @xmath103 and @xmath104 in their rest system equal : @xmath105 where @xmath106 stands for the square of the invariant mass of the @xmath107 system considered as one quasi  particle .",
    "the above relation gives an expression for the flux factor f from equation   in terms of the colliding masses of the nucleons and the total energy s only , namely : @xmath108 where we have chosen the convention introduced by byckling and kajantie  @xcite and included the @xmath109 factors for the phase  space @xmath110 and for the matrix element @xmath111 into the definition of f. it is important to note that at threshold , for an excess energy range of a few tens of mev , the small fractional changes of total energy @xmath112 causes weak variations of the flux factor and influences only slightly the shape of the energy dependence of the total cross section .",
    "for a two  particle final state @xmath113 ( for instance for the reaction @xmath114 ) the phase ",
    "space integral defined in equation   reduces to @xmath115 and the total cross section for such reactions ( when neglecting variations due to the dynamical effects @xmath116 ) should increase linearly with the centre  of  mass momentum of the produced meson in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "the total cross section can be expressed analytically as a function of the masses of the particles participating in the reaction and the square of total reaction energy s : @xmath117 near threshold , at a given excess energy @xmath118 , the emission of the reaction products in the centre  of  mass frame is isotropic and the whole dynamics of the process manifests itself in the absolute value of the transition matrix element @xmath119 .",
    "the underlying production mechanisms can also be extracted from the deviations of the total cross section energy dependence following the prediction of relation  .",
    "a visualization of possible differences in the dynamics for the production of various mesons can be realized by comparing the total cross section of the studied reactions at the same value of the phase ",
    "space volume normalized to the flux factor ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "it is important to recognize that the comparison at the same centre  of  mass meson momentum ( @xmath121 ) gives direct information about the amplitude differences only if the production of mesons with the same masses is concerned ( for example @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) , yet the reactions @xmath114 and @xmath124 have by far different @xmath68 at the corresponding @xmath121 .",
    "however , if one is interested in the decomposition of the production amplitude according to the angular momenta of the final state particles then indeed the appropriate variable for the comparison even for particles with different masses is the meson momentum in the reaction centre  of  mass frame .",
    "correspondingly for the more than two  body final state , the adequate variable is the maximum meson momentum , since it is directly connected to the maximum angular momentum by the interaction range . considering for a three  body exit channel ( @xmath125 ) that the meson ( @xmath126 ) possesses maximum momentum when the remaining two particles are at rest relative to each other and employing definition   one obtains :    @xmath127    contrary to the two  body final state , at a fixed excess energy the dynamics of the meson production associated with two or more particles reflects itself not only in the absolute value of the square of the matrix element but also in distributions of variables determining the final state kinematics .",
    "usually , in non  relativistic calculations of the total cross section , one takes the jacobi momenta , choosing as independent variables the qmeson momentum in the reaction centre  of  mass frame and kmomentum of either nucleon in the rest frame of the nucleon  nucleon subsystem . by means of the @xmath101 function",
    "they can be expressed as : @xmath128 with @xmath129 denoting the square of the invariant mass of the nucleon  nucleon subsystem . in a non ",
    "relativistic approximation the expression of the total cross section defined by formula   for a meson production reaction in nucleon ",
    "nucleon interactions of the type @xmath130 simplifies to : @xmath131 denoting by @xmath132 and @xmath133 the relative angular momentum of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon pair and of the meson relative to the @xmath12 system , respectively and approximating the final state particles by non  distorted plane waves ( case of non  interacting objects ) , whose radial parts @xmath134 are given by the spherical bessel functions : @xmath135 an expansion of the transition amplitude @xmath136 for the @xmath137 partial wave around @xmath138 leads to @xmath139 applying the above proportionality in equation   and solving the integral , yields the partial cross section @xmath140 where @xmath141 with @xmath142 denoting the mass of the created meson  , here in order to avoid ambiguities with the abbreviation for the eta - meson , we introduce an additional suffix @xmath5 . ] .",
    "thus  at threshold  for the ss partial wave the cross section for the @xmath86 reaction should increase with energy of the fourth power of @xmath143 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath143 was introduced by rosenfeld  @xcite as a variable allowing for the qualitative estimations of the final state partial waves involved in pion production .",
    "he argued that if the phenomenon of pion production takes place at a characteristic distance r from the centre of the collision , with r in the order of @xmath144 , then the angular momentum of the produced meson is equal to @xmath145 .",
    "hence , @xmath146 denotes the classically calculated angular maximum momentum of the meson relative to the centre  of  reaction .",
    "the same arguments one finds in the work of gell  mann and watson  @xcite , where the authors do not expect the range of interaction to be greater than the compton wave - length of the produced meson @xmath147 .",
    "however , it is rather a momentum transfer @xmath34 between the colliding nucleons which determines the distance to the centre of the collision @xmath148 at which the production occurs .",
    "based on the data indications , it is emphasized in the original article of rosenfeld  @xcite that r is slightly less than @xmath149 , which is numerically close to the value of @xmath150 .",
    "directly at threshold , where all ejectiles are at rest in the centre  of  mass frame , @xmath34 is equal to the centre  of  mass momentum of the interacting nucleons and hence , exploring equation   it can be expressed as : @xmath151 though the present considerations are constrained to the spin averaged production only , it is worth noting that very close  to  threshold  due to the conservation laws and the pauli excluding principle  , where l , s and t denote angular momentum , spin and isospin of the nucleon pair , respectively .",

    "proton collision near threshold only via the transition between @xmath155 and @xmath156 partial waves  ( see table  [ partialtransitions ] ) .",
    "therefore only the collision of protons with relative angular momentum equal to @xmath157 and a parallel spin orientation  which flips during the reaction  may lead to the production of negative parity neutral mesons . in the case of the production of neutral scalar mesons ,",
    "the protons or neutrons must collide with anti ",
    "parallel spin orientations which remains unchanged after the reaction .",
    "these simple considerations imply that in the close to threshold measurements with the polarized beam and target one should see a drastic effect in the reaction yield depending whether the polarization of reacting protons is parallel or anti - parallel . in the ideal case ,",
    "having the product of beam and target polarization equal to unity , the close to threshold @xmath44 , @xmath11 or @xmath158 production can be realized only in case of the parallel spin orientation of the reacting protons and for the anti - parallel polarizations zero yield should be observed .",
    "indeed , in reality , strong differences in the yield for various combinations of beam and target polarization have been determined in the pioneering measurements of the reaction @xmath159 at the iucf facility  @xcite .    due to both the strong nucleon ",
    "nucleon low ",
    "energy interaction in the @xmath16 state and the meson  nucleon forces in the exit channel , the assumption of the non  interactive plane waves leading to equation   failed when confronted with experimental data . however , these deviations give the possibility for determining the still poorly known nucleon  meson interactions .",
    "the interaction between particles depends on their relative momenta .",
    "consequently , for investigations of final state interactions more instructive coordinates , than the q and k momenta , are the squared invariant masses of the two  body subsystems  @xcite .",
    "these are the coordinates of the dalitz plot . in the original paper  @xcite dalitz",
    "has proposed a representation for the energy partitions of three bodies in an equilateral triangle whose sides are the axes of the centre  of  mass energies .",
    "he took advantage of the fact that the sum of distances from a point within the triangle to its sides is a constant equal to the height .",
    "therefore , the height of the triangle measures the total energy @xmath160 and interior points  fulfilling four  momentum conservation  represent energy partitions . for a constant @xmath99 due to the energy conservation , without loosing any information ,",
    "it is enough to consider the projection on any of the @xmath161 planes .",
    "the linear relation between @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) allows to use @xmath165 or @xmath161 coordinates equivalently , with the following relation between the phase ",
    "space intervals : @xmath166 . according to the kilian s geometrical representation  @xcite",
    "a dalitz lies on a plane in the three dimensional space ( @xmath167 ) orthogonal to the space diagonal . the plane including a dalitz plot corresponding to a given total energy s is then given by the following scalar product  @xcite : @xmath168",
    "the second equality of equation   means that there are only two independent invariant masses of the three subsystems and",
    "therefore a projection onto any of the @xmath169 planes still comprises the whole principally accessible information about the final state interaction of the three  particle system . in the case of no dynamics whatsoever and the absence of any final state interaction the occupation of the dalitz plot",
    "would be fully homogeneous since each phase  space interval would be equally probable . the final state interaction would then appear as a structure on that area . figure  [ dalitz_examples]a shows  for the example of the @xmath170 reaction  how the uniformly populated phase  space density is modified by the s  wave ( @xmath16 ) interaction between outgoing protons .",
    "an enhancement in the range corresponding to the low relative momentum between protons is clearly visible .",
    "a steep decrease of the occupation density with increasing invariant mass of the proton  proton subsystem is even better seen in figure  [ dalitz_examples]b presenting the projection of the phase ",
    "space distribution onto the @xmath171 axis indicated by an arrow in figure  [ dalitz_examples]a .",
    "this is a direct reflection of the shape of the proton  proton ( @xmath16 ) partial wave amplitude shown in figure  [ dalitz_examples]c .",
    "figure  [ dalitz_examples]d shows the dalitz plot distribution simulated when switching off the proton  proton interaction but accounting for the interaction between the @xmath11meson and the proton . due to the lower strength of this interaction the expected deviations from the uniform distributions are by about two orders of magnitude smaller , but one recognizes a slight enhancement of the density in the range of low invariant masses of proton@xmath11 subsystems .",
    "however , due to weak variations of the proton@xmath11 scattering amplitude the enhancement originating from the @xmath11meson interaction with one proton is not separated from the @xmath11meson interaction with the second proton .",
    "therefore an overlapping of broad structures occurs .",
    "it is observed that the occupation density grows slowly with increasing @xmath171 opposite to the effects caused by the s  wave proton ",
    "proton interaction , yet similar to the modifications expected for the p  wave one  @xcite . from the above example it is obvious that only in high statistics experiments signals from the meson ",
    "nucleon interaction can appear over the overwhelming nucleon  nucleon final state interaction .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that the dalitz plot does not reflect any possible correlations between the entrance and exit channel  @xcite .",
    "the dalitz plot representation allows also for a simple interpretation of the kinematically available phase  space volume as an area of that plot .",
    "namely , equation   becomes : @xmath172 where the limits of integrations defining the boundaries of the dalitz plot can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath173 thus , the phase  space volume kinematically available for the three ",
    "body final state can be written by means of only one integral : @xmath174 whose solution leads , in general , to elliptic functions  @xcite .",

    "relativistic approximation differs only by a few per cent from the full solution given in equation  , which in fact with an up  to  date computer can be solved numerically with little effort .",
    "therefore , in the following chapters we will describe the data as a function of @xmath68 as well as of q or @xmath143 , if it is found to be appropriate .",
    "the choice of the proper observables for picking up the dynamical effects in the case of a four  particle exit channel is by far more complicated .",
    "it was for example discussed by chodrow  @xcite who has given the extension of the dalitz representation to the four  body final states .",
    "he has proven that the two  body correlation in the case where there are two identical particles in the four  body final state  say @xmath107  can be directly visible in the density distribution of events on the @xmath179plane , where @xmath180 denotes the energy of particle @xmath103 and @xmath181 is defined as :    @xmath182      extending meson production experiments from the free nucleon  nucleon interaction to interactions of light nuclei is interesting for many reasons .",
    "first of all it offers the possibility to study more complex production processes with more than only one target nucleon involved .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of free neutron targets , it gives the possibility to study the meson creation in the proton ",

    "first experiments of @xmath184 meson production in the proton  neutron reaction with simultaneous tagging of the spectator proton have recently been carried out at celsius and resulted in a resolution of the excess energy equal to @xmath185  @xcite . in the quasi - free approximation ( fig .",
    "[ qfree ] ) it is assumed that the bombarding proton interacts exclusively with one nucleon in the target nucleus and that the other nucleons affect the reaction by providing a momentum distribution to the struck constituent only . this assumption is justified if the kinetic energy of a projectile is large compared to the binding energy of the hit nucleus . in fact , as noticed by slobodrian  @xcite , also the scattering of protons on a hydrogen target , where the protons are bound by molecular forces , may serve as an extreme example of the quasi  free reaction . in that case , although the hydrogen atoms rotate or vibrate in the molecule , their velocities and binding forces are totally negligible with respect to the velocity and nuclear forces operating the scattering of the relativistic proton  @xcite .",
    "the deuteron is also relatively weakly bound with a binding energy of @xmath186 , which is by far smaller  more than two orders of magnitude in the case of pion and already more than three orders of magnitude in the case of @xmath45 meson production  than the kinetic energy of the bombarding protons needed for the creation of mesons in the proton  neutron interaction .",
    "however , it has to be considered that even the low binding energy of @xmath186 results in large fermi momenta of the nucleons which can not be neglected .",
    "the momentum and kinetic energy spectra of the nucleons in the deuteron are shown in figure  [ fermi_mom_and_kin ] .    in the considered approximation",

    "[ fermi_mom_and_kin]b ) is spread by more than a factor of 30 .",
    "+    therefore , especially in the case of near  threshold measurements , where the cross section grows rapidly with increasing excess energy  ( see e.g.   fig .  [ dieter_wasserfall ] ) the total centre  of  mass energy @xmath99 has to be determined on an event  by  event level .",
    "for this purpose , in experiments , the spectator protons are usually registered by silicon pad or @xmath193strip detectors  @xcite which determine their kinetic energy ( @xmath194 ) and polar emission angle ( @xmath195 ) .",

    "measuring both the energy and the emission angle of the spectator protons it is possible to study the energy dependence of a meson production cross section from data taken at only one fixed beam momentum .",
    "it must be noted , however , that in the framework of the impulse approximation , illustrated in figure  [ qfree ] , the measured spectator proton is a physical particle , yet the reacting neutron is off its mass shell , where the explicit expression for its four  momentum vector @xmath198 , in the rest frame of the deuteron , reads : @xmath199 with @xmath194 and @xmath189 denoting the kinetic energy and the momentum vector of a spectator proton , respectively .",

    "the struck neutron is never on its mass shell and the minimum deviation from the real mass occurs for vanishing fermi  momentum and  as can be inferred from equation    is equal to the binding energy @xmath204 .",
    "measurements performed at the celsius and triumf accelerators for the @xmath71  @xcite and @xmath205  @xcite reactions , respectively , have shown that within the statistical errors there is no difference between the total cross section of the free and quasi  free processes . in figure  [ free_vs_quasifree]a the production of the @xmath11 meson in free proton ",
    "proton collisions is compared to the production inside a deuteron and in the overlapping regions the data agree within the statistical errors .",

    "prior to the more comprehensive discussion of the production mechanism for different mesons let us present one more interesting observation visualizing that the production dynamics depends strongly not only on the structure of the created meson but also on the isospin configuration of the colliding nucleons .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath11 meson the comparison of the cross section from the production in proton  proton and proton  neutron collisions revealed that the yield of the @xmath11 meson in the isosinglet nucleon configuration exceeds the one in the isospin triplet state by more than an order of magnitude . the ratio @xmath371 presented in figure  [ cfisi_vps]b , was determined to be about 6.5 in the excess energy range between @xmath372 and @xmath373  @xcite .",

    "nucleon interaction , especially in case when the nucleons are very close together  . as pointed out by nakayama  @xcite",
    ", the transition region from the hadronic to constituent quark degrees of freedom does not have a well defined boundary and at present both approaches should be evaluated in order to test their relevance in the description of close  to  threshold meson production in the collision of nucleons .",
    "simple geometrical considerations presented in figure  [ cartoon ] indicate that at distances smaller than @xmath379 the internucleon potential should begin to be free of meson exchange effects and may be dominated by the residual colour forces  @xcite . in the previous section",
    "it was shown , that the close  to  threshold production of mesons occurs when the colliding nucleons approach distances of about @xmath380 in case of @xmath44 and of about @xmath47 in case of @xmath45 production ( see table  [ momtranstable ] ) .",
    "this distance is by about an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath379 and it is rather difficult to imagine  in coordinate space  an exchange of mesons between nucleons as mechanism of the creation process .",
    "such small collision parameters imply that the interacting nucleons  objects of about 1  fm  overlap and their internal degrees of freedom may be of importance .",
    "nonetheless , in the last decade , the effective theory based on the meson exchanges , which accounts for the size of the participating particles by introduction of the momentum transfer dependent form factors , has been extensively utilized for the description of the creation process .",
    "figure  [ graph_mesonexchange ] represents the regarded mechanisms .",
    "the question which processes  on the mesonic level  are responsible for the @xmath44 production was considered already in 1966 by koltun and reitan  @xcite .",
    "the authors deemed the direct pion production on one of the protons ( fig .",

    "subsequent investigations showed that the inclusion of the processes illustrated in figure  [ graph_mesonexchange]b , when the pion is produced on one of the protons and then scatters on the other one ( in the @xmath351 s  wave  @xcite and @xmath351 p  wave via @xmath28  @xcite ) , increases the cross section essentially yet not enough to describe the data , even if the off  shell properties of the @xmath351 amplitude are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the rescattering mechanism is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ haidenbauer_acta ] .",
    "the agreement with the data can , however , be achieved  as shown by the solid line  if one takes additionally into account the mechanisms of heavy ",

    "@xcite and @xmath385  @xcite they reveal serious discrepancies when confronted with the angular dependences of the spin correlation coefficients and @xmath386 of the @xmath159 reaction  @xcite . therefore , further investigations concnerning the relative contributions of various mechanisms , as well as the different partial waves are still required .",
    "+ the role of the mechanisms leading to the @xmath9 production have been also considered in context of the lowest  order chiral perturbation theory  @xcite and relativistic impulse approximation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the meson exchange models the chiral perturbation method results  @xcite in the destructive interference between the direct and the pion - rescattering terms , and consequently implies more significant contributions originating from the shorter - than - pion - range mechanisms , like the heavy - meson exchanges or the creation of pions in the fusion of exchanged mesons  @xcite .    in case of the @xmath11 and @xmath158 mesons the investigations of the mechanisms underlying the production process are even more difficult .",
    "it is partly due to the fact that in contrary to the pion case even the coupling constants determining the strength of the @xmath387 vertex are poorly established .",
    "the values derived by various methods differ by more than an order of magnitude  @xcite .",

    "though all the quoted groups reproduce the magnitude of the total cross section , their models differ significantly as far as the relative contribution from the @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath378 exchange mechanisms is concerned .",
    "the discrepancies are due to the not well known strength of @xmath79@xmath37@xmath53 couplings and the @xmath211 scattering potential .",

    "channel multi  resonance model  @xcite . in any case",
    ", the hitherto performed studies aiming to describe the total cross section show that the close  to  threshold production of @xmath11 mesons in nucleon  nucleon collisons is dominated by the intermediate virtual @xmath53 nucleon isobar whose width overlaps with the threshold . in order to disentangle between various scenarios of the @xmath53 excitation",
    "a confrontation of the predictions with other observables is needed .",
    "the interference between considered amplitudes causes a different behaviour  depending on the assumed scenario  e.g.  of the @xmath11 meson angular distributions .",
    "these differences , however , are too weak in the close  to  threshold region to judge between different models .",
    "also the ratio of the @xmath11 meson production via the reactions @xmath391 and @xmath392 can be equally well described either by assuming the @xmath378 meson exchange dominance  @xcite or by taking pseudoscalar and vector mesons for exciting the @xmath53 resonance  @xcite . in the latter case , shown in figure  [ nakayama_eta ] , the excitation of the resonance via the @xmath378 meson exchange was found to be negligible . yet , the predictions of the analyzing power depends crucially on the assumed mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this fact has triggered already experimental investigations which aim to determine the spin observables  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ nakayama_eta ] presents also a contribution from the mesonic current where the @xmath11 meson is created in the fusion of virtual e.g.   @xmath378 or @xmath390 mesons emitted from both colliding nucleons . in comparison to the overwhelming strength of the resonance current this mechanism is however by a factor of 30 too weak .",
    "in contrast , it is enough to explain the magnitude of the close  to  threshold @xmath158 meson production in the proton ",
    "proton interaction , which is just by about a factor of 30 smaller compared to the @xmath11 meson . among the mesonic currents regarded by authors of reference  @xcite",
    "the @xmath393 gives the dominant contribution , by a factor of five larger than the @xmath394 and @xmath395exchange .",
    "however , the understanding of the @xmath158 production on the hadronic level is far from being satisfactory .",
    "the magnitude of the total cross section was also well reproduced in the frame of a one  boson  exchange model ( nucleonic current ) where the virtual boson ( @xmath396 ) created on one of the colliding protons converts to the @xmath158 on the other one  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the off  shell effects of the @xmath397 amplitude it was found that the short range @xmath26 and @xmath378 meson exchanges dominate the creation process , whereas the @xmath9 exchange plays a minor role . on the contrary ,",
    "other authors  @xcite reproduced the magnitude of the total cross section with @xmath9 exchange only and concluded that the @xmath11 , @xmath378 and @xmath390 exchange currents either play no role or cancel each other .",
    "however , in both of the above quoted calculations  @xcite the initial state interaction between protons , which reduces the rate by a factor of about 3 , was not taken into account and hence the obtained results would in any case reproduce only @xmath398 of the entire magnitude and could be at least qualitatively reconciled with the mentioned result of reference  @xcite , where the nucleonic current was found to be small .",
    "moreover , the choice of the another prescription for the form factors could reduce the one  pion  exchange contribution substantially  @xcite . however , the picture that the @xmath158 meson is predominantly created through the mesonic current , which we would like to advocate , remains at present unclear as well .",
    "this is because the magnitude of the total cross section could have been also described assuming that the production of @xmath158 is resonant  @xcite . as possible intermediary resonances",
    "the recently reported  @xcite @xmath399 and @xmath400 have been considered .",
    "these resonances were deduced from @xmath158 photoproduction data , under the assumption that the close  to  threshold enhancement observed for the @xmath401 reaction can be utterly assigned to resonance production .",
    "further , as well strong , assumptions have been made in the derivation of the @xmath402 and @xmath403 coupling constants  @xcite .",

    "unil now it was not possible to estimate satisfactorily the relative contributions of the nucleonic , mesonic and resonance current to the production process .",

    "an important physics aspect of the modern cooler ring facilities is the interaction of particles in the final state . a detailed study of the dalitz plot of , e.g. the reaction @xmath813 measured at cosy-11  @xcite , made possible the extraction of valuable information about the @xmath518@xmath37 interaction .    the @xmath814 reaction , measured at tsl in uppsala  @xcite , limited significantly the range of values for the @xmath11@xmath37 scattering length",
    "this quantity is the relevant input for calculations studying the existence of @xmath11nucleus bound states .      throughout the article",
    "the importance of an intermediate excitation of baryon resonances has been pointed out .",
    "+ at excess energies of 12 gev , baryon resonances begin to play an important role in nucleon  nucleon collisions .",
    "most of our understanding about these resonances comes from pion and photon induced reactions on the nucleon .",
    "current quark models predict many more resonances than can be experimentally extracted from the data .",
    "a large program at both jlab and elsa focuses on this so - called missing resonance problem and the search for yet unknown baryonic states in electro - nuclear reactions .",
    "however , besides the possibility that resonances thus far simply went unnoticed because the quality of the data was insufficient , another explanation might be that these resonances couple only weakly to photons or pions .",
    "an accelerator like cosy , built for nucleon  nucleon as well as nucleon ",
    "nucleus collisions will provide for the necessary experiments to fill that gap in the future .",
    "the investigation of symmetries and their breaking has always led to significant insights into the inner workings of nature . already a large program at cosy  @xcite is studying charge - symmetry breaking - an effect closely linked to the difference in the current masses of the light quarks .",
    "+ another interesting aspect of charge - symmetry breaking is its high sensitivity : once , for instance , the @xmath473@xmath482 mixing amplitude is isolated , it will provide us with insights about the nature of scalar resonances .",
    "studies about the structure of these resonances are under investigations at cosy  @xcite .",
    "+ at the celsius ring in uppsala the celsius / wasa detection system is in operation now and exciting experiments especially on @xmath11meson decay studies will start .",
    "naively , one would think that near - threshold meson production in pd collisions can be fully understood in terms of a short - ranged @xmath815 process , with the extra nucleon acting as a spectator .",
    "however , backward @xmath9 production in the @xmath816 can not be explained in terms of a spectator model . in the case of meson production in @xmath817 collisions",
    "the number of participating amplitudes is small as well , even though the transferred momentum is large .",
    "hereby a unique environment is available for studying the interaction of more than just two nucleons , e.g. three - nucleon forces .",
    "it is likely that eventually the research on three - nucleon forces will focus on this process .",
    "again , the role of polarization observables is important .      for the experiments ,",
    "the development of suitable experimental configurations , comprising polarized targets and associated detector systems that facilitate measurements of polarization observables is necessary .",
    "present and future experiments become possible only through the outstanding performance of the cooler accelerators . with the new injector for cosy",
    "the situation will be further improved .",
    "it will be possible to fill the machine up to the space - charge limit with polarized protons and deuterons , whereby electron - cooled beams at injection energy and stochastically - cooled beams at high energy of unprecedented brilliance will be available to the users .",
    "efficient correction schemes to preserve the polarization of protons during acceleration have already been established , while for deuterons no difficulties are anticipated , because no depolarizing resonances occur in the energy range of cosy .",
    "new polarization experiments in the future will certainly call for further refinement of the spin - manipulation systems in cosy , e.g. longitudinally polarized internal and external beams , for which suitable spin rotators have to be developed .",
    "the above mentioned examples  which will be the subject of a summer school and workshop on cosy physics  @xcite  demonstrate the richness of physics in meson production reactions .",
    "the drawback of this wealth comes at the expense that , apart from rare cases , it is difficult to extract a particular piece of information from the data , e.g. both resonances and final state interactions modify the invariant mass plot in a coherent superposition .",
    "+ fortunately , the use of polarization in the initial state acts as a spin filter and different contributions to the interaction can be singled out , because they show up in the angular distributions of different spin combinations .",
    "it is important to stress , that as long as only the lowest partial waves contribute significantly to the process under study , the number of independent observables from experiments with polarized beam and target is sufficient to allow for a model independent partial wave analysis .",
    "the authors would like to express their utmost graditude to the numerous people who gave the various help needed in order to successfully complete this article .",
    "+ especially we would like to thank r.  czyykiewicz , j.  flood , j.  haidenbauer , ch .",

    "<S> studies of meson production at threshold in the hadron  </S>",
    "<S> hadron interaction began in the fifties when sufficient energies of accelerated protons were available . </S>",
    "<S> a strong interdependence between developments in accelerator physics , detector performance and theoretical understanding led to a unique vivid field of physics . </S>",
    "<S> early experiments performed with bubble chambers revealed already typical ingredients of threshold studies , which were superseded by more complete meson production investigations at the nucleon beam facilities triumf , lampf , psi , lear and saturne . currently , with the advent of the new cooler rings as iucf , celsius and cosy the field is entering a new domain of precision and the next step of further progress .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this new data in the short range limit permits a more fundamental consideration and a quantitative comparison of the production processes for different mesons in the few  body final states . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of the data take advantage of the fact that production reactions close  to  threshold are characterized by only a few degrees of freedom between a well defined combination of initial and exit channels . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from predictions of phase  </S>",
    "<S> space controlled one  meson  exchange models are indications of new and exciting physics . </S>",
    "<S> precision data on differential cross sections , isospin and spin observables  partly but by no means adequately available  are presently turning up on the horizon . </S>",
    "<S> there is work for the next years and excitement of the physics expected . </S>",
    "<S> here we try to give a brief and at the same time comprehensive overview of this field of hadronic threshold production studies .    </S>",
