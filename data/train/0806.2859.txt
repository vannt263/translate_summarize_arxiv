    "@xcite created a series of models by simultaneously fitting the extinction , infrared emission , and elemental abundance constraints , by including , for example , amorphous carbon particles , organic refractory material , water ice , and voids .",
    "one of the many challenges in developing a viable model is that the characteristics of the dust may vary in different galactic locations due to different local evolutionary histories , ism phases , and abundances of elements .",
    "given such difficulties , a preeminent interstellar grain model has not been established . for our purposes , we use the wd01 grain model , although we allow the energy dependence of the scattering cross section to be a free parameter .",
    "the basic quantity that determines the characteristics of x - ray halos is the differential scattering cross section @xmath3 .",
    "this can be calculated using the exact mie solution or the simpler rayleigh - gans approximation . for the wd01 grain model ,",

    "it is clear that to accurately determine the proportionality between the source flux and the halo , one must know the history of the source flux for a sufficiently long time period preceding the observation . in most cases",
    "this is not practical , so typically one assumes that any change in the source flux took place sufficiently long ago for the halo to have completely responded to it ( as we do when estimating the dust distribution , ",

    "however , accounting for the time delays for multiply - scattered photons is extremely cumbersome .",
    "fortunately , the intensity of the halo due to photons scattered @xmath33-times , relative to the observed source flux , is @xmath34 @xcite , so the halo intensity for multiply - scattered photons decreases rapidly for reasonably small optical depths ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "although the use of the grating reduces the zeroth - order image count rate by about a factor of 3 , the dispersed spectrum provides accurate measurements of the source flux and spectrum , which is necessary to accurately model the characteristics of the x - ray halo and the psf .",
    "one of the observations ( obsid 1943 ) began at mjd 51908.01 and lasted for 45 ks , corresponding to @xmath36 , where determination of the orbital phases was accomplished using the mid - eclipse ephemeris from burderi et al .",

    "for the plateau phase observation , a single exposure map was created for each energy band . on the other hand , accurate measurements of the evolution of the halo flux in each energy band during the eclipse egress observation required the use of separate exposure maps ( due to the dither of the telescope ) using 500 s bins ( 1200 exposure maps in total ) . due to issues with the diffracted hetg photons confusing the background analysis ( hetg photons create a diffuse `` transfer swath '' analogous to the `` transfer streak '' in the zeroth - order image ) ,",
    "we did not use halo angles greater than 110 .",
    "the surface brightness distributions were divided by the flux measurements in each band to produce images in units of flux fraction per square arcsecond .",

    "this is acceptable because we restrict our investigation to angular scales that are much larger than the @xmath1205  resolution of the telescope mirrors .",

    "first , we created separate single - scattered x - ray halo profiles for twenty step - function dust distributions of width @xmath43 ( hereafter referred to as `` clouds '' ) , spanning the entire line of sight , i.e. , 0.00 to 0.05 , 0.05 to 0.10 , and so on , for each energy band . by summing the twenty profiles with equal weighting , one could obtain the single - scattered x - ray halo for dust distributed uniformly along the line of sight .",
    "the normalization of each cloud ( @xmath44 ) , which is proportional to the contribution to the total scattering optical depth ( due to the normalization @xmath45 ) , was allowed to vary freely .",
    "the initial fit function at each energy is @xmath46 where @xmath47 note that the superscript in @xmath48 is a label that indicates a position along the line of sight and is not an exponent .",
    "using this method , the dimensionless dust density and scattering optical depth are simply @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the halos for each energy band were fit simultaneously .",
    "for the initial fit , we used the energy scaling of the scattering optical depth from the wd01 interstellar grain model ( @xmath50 ) ; however , we found it to underpredict the halo flux at higher energies ( or overpredict the flux at lower energies ) .",
    "we therefore allowed the energy scaling to also be a free parameter , although we required that it be a smooth function , i.e. , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fit parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the angular dependence of the scattering at a particular energy still follows the functional form predicted by the wd01 model ( see eq . [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit normalization of each cloud provided a preliminary dust distribution .",
    "given the preliminary model , the x - ray halo for double - scattered photons was calculated ( @xmath54 ) , included in the model as an additional term in eq .",

    "the lower limit on the cloud size was zero , i.e. no dust , simply because the clouds to either side of the cloud in question could produce a surface brightness distribution with a similar shape .",

    "note , however , that we do not have reliable data for halo angles less than about 3 , so we are mostly insensitive to dust that produces centrally - peaked halos , i.e. , dust very near the source ( @xmath59 ) . therefore , it is more accurate to consider the scattering optical depth in fig .",

    "the three small panels labeled @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( corresponding to the upper limits shown in the main panel ) show examples of dust distributions that are also consistent with the data at the 90% confidence level .",
    "[ distribution],width=336 ]    it could be argued that lack of knowledge of the dust very near the source poses a problem for our distance estimate .",
    "this is not the case : for an assumed distance of 8 kpc , the @xmath1205 angular resolution of the _ chandra _  mirrors corresponds to approximately 4000 au , which , based on the orbital parameters of the binary system , is more than 4 orders of magnitude larger than the semi - major axis of the orbit .",
    "therefore , the point source flux already includes all of the effects due to scattering in the vicinity of the binary system .",
    "considering the best - fit dust distribution , it is clear that the assumption that the halo during the plateau phase observation had responded to the preceding eclipse egress is not valid for all halo angles .",
    "as pointed out above , an estimate of the time cen x-3 has been out of eclipse at the beginning of the observation is about 30 ks . the causally - connected regions of @xmath23 vs. @xmath17 phase space for delay times less than 30 ks are shown in figure [ boundary ] for three source distances , indicating that the assumption is invalid for large @xmath23 and @xmath17 . fortunately",

    "we chose to model the flux history by first assuming the shape of the light curve during the eclipse ingress in each energy band is same as the shape during egress , but scaled to 87% of flux after egress ( fig . [ egresses ] , top - left panel , dotted curve ) .",
    "it is widely known that the cen x-3 flux decreases after @xmath74 , and the scaling factor represents the average 210 kev flux change that was observed during two consecutive binary orbits by @xcite .",

    "to test the effect of various dust positions for @xmath65 we calculated model light curves for the five positions with @xmath96 in @xmath65 , maintaining a constant amount of dust in the cloud by increasing its normalization by a corresponding amount . for each of the five trial dust positions ,",
    "the fit statistic was calculated at each distance ( fig .",
    "[ diffdist ] ) .",
    "the results are somewhat troubling , because although dust positions at @xmath101 do not greatly affect the implied distance , dust oriented at @xmath102 $ ] produce two local minima , with the best - fit distance becoming very small .",
    "the dust distribution to cen x-3 can be checked for consistency in a number of ways .",
    "here we apply three methods .",
    "first , using the results of dame et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we can map the co emission in the direction of cen x-3 , which presumably also traces the dust .",
    "the most prominent peak in the emission has a velocity of @xmath103 km / s ( fig .",
    "[ co ] ) . the kinematic distance to the co responsible for this feature",
    "could be estimated from the rotation curve of the galaxy , but because molecular clouds have a cloud - cloud dispersion of 4@xmath1045 km s@xmath105 , kinematic distances for clouds with @xmath106 km s@xmath105 are not reliable ; all that can be said is that co emission has a relatively local origin ( t.  m. dame , priv .",
    "second , parallax measurements provide the spatial density of stars along the line of sight to cen x-3 . using data from the _ hipparcos catalog _",
    ", we created a histogram of the number of stars within 125 of the line of sight ( figure [ hippar ] ) .",
    "of course , the parallax data are subject to certain selection effects . for one ,",
    "stars at larger distances are less likely to be above the flux limit of the survey . on the other hand",
    ", a given solid angle corresponds to a larger volume of space at larger distances .",
    "nevertheless , assuming star - forming regions are cospatial with regions of higher dust density , the histogram of star counts supports that conclusion that most of the dust is located at relatively small distances from the sun .",
    "finally , interstellar reddening data may be able to constrain the dust distribution .",
    "@xcite modeled the interstellar extinction distribution in the galaxy by comparing the infrared colors measured by the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) to the colors from the besanon model of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the resulting data for the cen x-3 sightline , which shows the interstellar extinction ( @xmath107 ) , are presented in fig .",
    "[ aks ] ( top panel ) .",
    "the constant slope of @xmath107 indicates that the dust is uniformly distributed between about 2 and 9 kpc .",
    "because there are no data for @xmath108 kpc , these interstellar reddening data can not support or refute the claim for the local origin of the dust towards cen x-3 .",
    "however , by dividing the difference in extinction between neighboring bins by the distance between them , one can visualize the distribution of extinction elements along the sightline ( figure [ aks ] , bottom panel ) for @xmath109 kpc .",
    "the results for this region of space are consistent with the dust being uniformly distributed , although we point out that the error bars allow for a slight increase in dust density for @xmath110 kpc , which is coincident with a slight increase in the upper limits to the size of the dust clouds shown in fig .",

    ", width=336 ]     and @xmath112 ) versus distance in the direction of cen x-3 ( centered 013 away from the sightline ) .",
    "data are from @xcite.[aks],width=336 ]",
    "in this paper , we have discovered that most of the dust along the line of sight to cen x-3 is located relatively nearby the sun , and that the distance to the binary system may be smaller than the commonly assumed distance of 8 kpc .",
    "although our distance estimate is not particularly robust , we note that the best - fit distance and 8 kpc are only marginally inconsistent at the 68% confidence level , and the best - fit distance is consistent with 8 kpc at the 90% level .    despite the uncertainty in the distance to cen x-3 , by all indications the dust along the line of sight to the system",
    "is heavily concentrated within about 300 pc of the sun . presumably , this dust is from the local orion spur where the sun resides .",
    "not only do the x - ray halo measurements , the co emission measurements , and the density of stars along the line of sight support this idea , but the halo light curves during egress clearly show a rapid response to changes in the point source flux ( fig .",
    "[ fits ] ) .",
    "in fact , model light curves for a uniform dust distribution ( not shown ) , or for a distribution where the primary dust cloud is @xmath95 $ ] , grossly misrepresent the data .",
    "it is worth examining the difference between the energy dependence of the scattering optical depth predicted by the wd01 interstellar grain model , and the empirical curve describing cen x-3 as well as data from cyg x-1 and gx 13 + 1 ( fig .",
    "[ tau ] ) . clearly , the shape of the wd01 curve and the cen x-3 empirical curve differ substantially .",
    "one possible explanation for the discrepancy is our choice of @xmath58 .",
    "after all , higher values of @xmath113 are observed in dense clouds , and we have found that most of the dust along the line of sight is located in a relatively small region of interstellar space .",
    "yet this is not a viable explanation because the difference in the scattering optical depth for different values of @xmath113 ( over 25 kev ) is more in the normalization and not the _ shape _ of the curve . for a given optical depth at 2 kev ,",
    "the increase in optical depth at 5 kev for @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) is 67% ( 1415% ) , whereas a @xmath126080% difference is required to explain the energy dependence of @xmath20 in cen x-3 .",
    "furthermore , the energy scaling of the scattering optical depth in cyg x-1 and gx 13 + 1 more closely resembles the empirical curve for cen x-3 than the wd01 model curve . in his comparison ,",
    "draine ( 2003 ) focused on the apparent differences between the predicted and measured values of @xmath116 for various x - ray sources , and not on the shape of the energy dependence .",
    "our results , and those of @xcite and @xcite , suggest that the wd01 model fails to accurately reflect the energy dependence of the scattering optical depth .",
    "relative to the wd01 model , there appears to be less scattering at low energies , or alternatively , more scattering at high energies ( due to uncertainties in the absolute normalization of the scattering optical depth ) in cyg x-1 , gx 13 + 1 , and cen x-3 .",
    "the vast majority of the dust along the line of sight to cen x-3 is located within 300 pc ( @xmath117 ) of the sun .",
    "the most likely location of the dust is the local orion spur .",
    "however , we are not sensitive to dust located in the vicinity of cen x-3 because data within @xmath123  of the central source are affected by pile - up .",
    "2 .   the geometric distance to cen x-3 is @xmath118 kpc ( 68% confidence level ) , although this result is not valid if a large fraction of the dust is concentrated within @xmath119 .",
    "3 .   the energy scaling of the scattering optical depth predicted by the wd01 interstellar grain model does not accurately represent the results determined by x - ray halo studies of cen x-3 .",
    "relative to the wd01 model , there appears to be less scattering at low energies or more scattering at high energies in cyg x-1 , gx 13 + 1 , and cen x-3 .",
    "we thank t.  m. dame for providing the co emission data that was used to create fig .",
    "we also acknowledge that d. marshall provided the data for fig .",
    "we also thank the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions that improved on the first draft of the paper .",
    "this work was supported by nasa contract nas5 - 30720 and _ chandra _ grant go7 - 8046x .",
    "the excellent angular resolution of the _ chandra _  high resolution mirror assembly ( hrma ) and the good spectral resolution of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) provide the best opportunity to date for the study of x - ray halos .",
    "however , careful subtraction of the point spread function ( psf ) is still required to produced accurate results .",
    "the raw images of x - ray sources are the convolution of the x - ray halo surface brightness distribution and the psf of the mirror assembly , modified by the instrumental response of the ccds , the reduction of effective area at larger off - axis angles due to vignetting , and the dithering of the telescope throughout the observation .",
    "exposure maps account for all of these effects , with the exception of the psf . at small halo angles ( @xmath120 ) marx simulations",
    "can be used to model the psf , but at larger halo angles the results of marx simulations appear to be unreliable ( gaetz 2004 ) . furthermore",
    ", with piled - up sources it becomes difficult to obtain the correct psf normalization .    in order to address these issues , we chose to develop a representation of the psf by utilizing all _ chandra_/hetg observations of pks 2155 - 304 and her x-1 .",
    "these two sources are both out of the plane of the galaxy and have interstellar hydrogen column densities of @xmath121 @xmath15 along the line of sight .",
    "presumably , this also means that the amount of dust along the line of sight is nearly negligible , meaning the radial profiles of the zeroth - order images are almost purely due to the psf , with only a very small contribution due to dust - scattering .",
    "we use the hetg observations of these sources for two reasons : ( 1 ) the grating allows for flux and spectral measurements , making it possible to accurately normalize the psf as a function of energy ; and ( 2 ) the use of the grating will provide consistent analysis when we apply the resulting psf parameter values to our observations of cen x-3 ( in case the diffraction of photons from the hetg modifies the psf ) .",
    "the drawback to this approach , however , is that grating reduces zeroth - order effective area and the statistical quality of the images . to try to overcome the problem of limited statistics , we co - added the zeroth - order images and first - order meg / heg spectra from five observations of her x-1 ( obsids 2749 , 3821 , 3822 , 6149 , & 6150 ) and ten observations of pks 2155 - 304 ( obsids 1014 , 1705 , 3167 , 3706 , 3708 , 5173 , 6926 , 7291 , 8380 , & 8436 ) , for a total exposure time of 373 ks .",
