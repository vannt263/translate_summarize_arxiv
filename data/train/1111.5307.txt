    "therefore , the trion wigner crystal can be formed at the sufficiently higher densities than electron ( or hole ) wigner crystal , because the mass of trion is greater than the mass of the electron or hole .    above we considered the trion gas at zero temperature . at finite temperatures the defects",
    "will always destroy the long - range translational order in the 2d wigner crystals .",
    "we assume that a 2d wigner crystal in the ground state will have no defects . also let us mentioned that in practice , it is difficult to experimentally realize a wigner crystal because quantum mechanical fluctuations overpower the coulomb repulsion and quickly cause disorder . a low dense system is needed .",
    "in this paper we have reduced the three - body restricted problem for a spatially separated exciton and electron ( hole ) located in the cqws to the 2d three - body problem of the exciton and the projection of the electron ( hole ) on the plane of the exciton qw . in the limit of large spatial separation between the electron ( hole ) and exciton qws we have obtained the analytical expression for the wave functions of the trions @xmath0 and @xmath176 with the spatially separated electron ( hole ) and exciton .",
    "analytical results for the energy spectrum of the trion formed by the exciton and electron ( hole ) separated in different quantum wells are obtained , its dependence on the interwell separations is analyzed and a conditional probability distribution is calculated .",
    "the differences in the binding energies for @xmath1 and @xmath0 due to the difference between electron and hole masses is analyzed .",
    "the 2d wigner crystallization of the trions in the cqws is predicted . due to the fact that mass of the trion is greater than the mass of electron ,",
    "the critical density of the formation of the trion wigner crystal at zero temperature is sufficiently greater than the critical density of the electron wigner crystal ."
