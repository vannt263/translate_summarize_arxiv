    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are a special population of young neutron stars whose rotational powers are not sufficient to account for their x - ray luminosities ( @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 , see mereghetti 2008 for a recent review of axps and sgrs ) .",
    "the spin periods of all known axp and sgrs are in the range of 2  12 s. these sources undergo short ( @xmath8 1 s ) , super - eddington soft gamma - ray bursts .",
    "three out of four sgrs showed giant bursts with energies greater than @xmath9 erg .",
    "after a soft gamma ray burst episode , ( it is likely that some of these bursts were missed ) , these sources enter an x - ray outburst / enhancement phase characterized by a sharp increase and eventual decay in x - ray luminosity .",
    "some of the axps and sgrs have very low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath7 ) in the quiescent phase , and were detected during these x - ray enhancement phases .",
    "these sources are called transient axps . during",
    "an outburst , x - ray luminosity , , of the transient sources increases from a quiescent level of @xmath11 erg s@xmath7 to a maximum that remains in the  range of persistent axp / sgrs ( @xmath12  @xmath13 erg s@xmath7 ) .",
    "energetics and time scales of the soft gamma - ray bursts which are very likely to have magnetic origin resulted in the classification of such objects as `` magnetars '' ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) . in the magnetar model ,",
    "the source of the x - ray luminosity is the magnetic field decay , and the rotation rate of the neutron stars in these systems is assumed to be slowing down by the magnetic dipole torques in vacuum .",
    "this requires that the dipole component of the magnetic field has magnetar strength (  @xmath14 g ) on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the magnetar model has no explanation for the period clustering of axp / sgrs . explaining the optical and infrared ( ir ) observations of persistent and transient axp / sgrs in quiescent and outburst ( enhancement ) phases within the magnetar model also poses problems .    the fallback disk model ( chatterjee et al . 2000 ; alpar 2001 ) was initially proposed to explain the spin periods and x - ray luminosities of axps and sgrs .",
    "it was suggested that the initial properties of fallback disks , together with magnetic dipole moment and initial spin period , could be responsible for the formation of the other young neutron star populations as well ( alpar 2001 ) .",
    "later , it was shown that the optical , ir and x - ray observations of persistent axps and sgrs ( hereafter , we use `` axps '' to denote both axps and sgrs ) in both quiescent and enhancement phases can be explained consistently by the presence of active , accreting fallback disks in these systems ( eki & alpar 2003 ; ertan & alpar 2003 ; ertan & cheng 2004 ; ertan et al .",
    "2006 ; ertan & alikan 2006 ) .",
    "the detection of axp 4u 0142 + 61 in mid - ir bands clearly indicates the presence of a disk around this source ( wang et al .",
    "this mid - ir data , together with earlier detections in optical and near ir bands , can be well fit by an irradiated active disk model , provided that the dipole field which interacts with the accretion disk has conventional values of   @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 g on the surface of the young neutron star ( ertan et al .",
    "coherently with these results , x - ray luminosity , period , period derivative , and statistical distribution of axps can also be produced by the evolution of the neutron stars with fallback disks and with dipole fields  @xmath17 g ( ertan et al .",
    "2009 ) . based on these constraints on  indicated by our results",
    ", we proposed that the strong magnetic fields of axps must thus reside in multipoles which die rapidly in strength with increasing distance from the neutron star ( eki & alpar 2003 ; ertan at al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "recently reported upper bound on the period derivative of sgr 0418 + 5729 unambiguously revealed that the dipole field strength of this source can not be greater than @xmath4 7 @xmath18 g on the surface of the neutron star ( rea et al .",
    "this is in full agreement with our explanation , and clearly shows that the soft gamma - ray bursts do not require magnetar dipole fields .",
    "furthermore , if the dipole field is below this upper limit , then the dipole spin down age would not be accurate and other torque and magnetic field effects would need to be taken into account . in the frame of the disk model , rotational properties and x - ray luminosity of this sgr",
    "can be reached simultaneously within the cooling timescale of a neutron star with  @xmath15 10@xmath19 g ( alpar et al .",
    "recently , trmper et al . ( 2010 ) showed that the high - energy spectrum of axp 4u 0142 + 61 can be produced in the accretion column of this source mainly by the bulk comptonization process .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the x - ray enhancement ( outburst ) light curves of persistent and transient axps .",
    "we pursue the results of the work by ertan & erkut ( 2008 ) on the x - ray outburst light curve and the spin evolution of the transient axp xte j1810197 .",
    "the x - ray outburst light curve of this source showed a different decay morphology than those of persistent sources ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2004 , bernardini et al .",
    "2009 ) . by means of model",
    "fits to the x - ray enhancement data , ertan & erkut ( 2008 ) concluded that this difference could be due to a viscous disk instability ( see e.g. lasota 2001 for a review of the disk instability model ( dim ) ) in the fallback disks at a critical temperature in the @xmath20 k range .",
    "the fallback disks around axps are expected to have similar chemical compositions .",
    "if one of the axp disks undergoes a thermal - viscous disk instability at a particular critical temperature , then the others are also expected to show the same instability at the same temperature .",
    "our aim is to test this idea by applying the same model to the x - ray outburst data of other transient axps .",
    "there are some difficulties in testing our model when the observed x - ray luminosity is close to the quiescent level (  @xmath10 erg s@xmath7 ) of the transient axps . as  decreases",
    ", temperature also decreases and thus effects of interstellar absorption increase .",
    "furthermore , at these low temperatures , a significant fraction of the x - ray emission may come from outside the observational x - ray band and estimates of the bolometric luminosities are model dependent ( gotthelf & halpern 2007 ; bernardini et al .",
    "our model gives the total accretion luminosity without addressing the x - ray spectrum from the surface or the accretion column of the neutron star . for comparison with data , we assume that the observed   is a close representation of the total , which is a good assumption for the x - ray luminosities down to a few times @xmath21 erg s@xmath7 but does not allow a reliable comparison for lower luminosities .",
    "another difficulty at very low  arises due to the fact that the luminosity contribution from the intrinsic cooling of the neutron star ( page et al .",
    "2006 ) could become comparable to the accretion luminosity depending on the age of the source .",
    "keeping these uncertainties in mind , we extend the model curves to the quiescent luminosity levels to present the model predictions at low . as in other works on disk accretion , we do not perform @xmath22 tests , since it is misleading due to the uncertainties in the disk , like the local instabilities close to the inner disk , that are not possible to address in the models .",
    "basic disk parameters , namely , the critical disk temperature , kinematic viscosity parameters , irradiation strength , and the radius dependence of the surface density of the extended disk are expected to be similar in the fallback disks of different axps .",
    "this forces us to a difficult task of producing the x - ray outburst light curves of axps with a single set of these basic parameters .",
    "we describe our model and discuss the effect of the disk parameters on the x - ray luminosity evolution in section 2 .",
    "properties of the transient axps that were observed in x - ray enhancement phases are summarized in section 3 .",
    "we discuss the results of the model calculations in section 4 and summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we solve the disk diffusion equation ( see , e.g. , frank et al .",
    "2002 ) in the way described in ertan & alpar ( 2003 ) and ertan & erkut ( 2008 ) . in this model , it is assumed that a soft gamma - ray burst triggered on the surface of the neutron star pushes the inner disk matter outward .",
    "some of this matter could escape from the system , while the remaining part creates a surface density gradient at the innermost disk .",
    "the resultant pile - up , centered at @xmath23 , and the underlying disk distribution are represented by a gaussian @xmath24 exp [ @xmath25 $ ] and a power - law @xmath26 surface density profile respectively as the initial condition of the model .",
    "we assume that the surface density profile of the innermost disk in the quiescent state is close to the standard thin disk profile @xmath27 , and the disk matter from  to a radius @xmath28 , with mass @xmath29 , is initially pushed out to a narrow radial region at radius @xmath28 by the burst . as the matter with a range of specific angular momentum mixes and piles up at @xmath28 , the angular momentum is redistributed rapidly due to mixing and the narrow radial extent of the pile - up .",
    "the required timescale for the sharing of angular momentum is of the order of a few @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the keplerian velocity close to @xmath28 and @xmath32 is the thickness of the disk , typical lengthscale for efficient viscous interaction , at @xmath28 .",
    "taking @xmath33 and @xmath34 cm , @xmath35 is found to be a fraction of a second .",
    "this implies that the angular momentum is effectively shared during the formation of the pile - up .",
    "after the burst episode , this matter circularizes at a radius between  and @xmath28 depending on the mean specific angular momentum of the pile - up .",
    "the matter spreading from this circularization radius to both inner and outer radii with a surface density peak close to the circularization radius is represented by a gaussian as the initial mass distribution in our model .",
    "the center @xmath23  of the gaussian in the model could be assumed to represent this circularization radius .",
    "our model light curves do not sensitively depend on @xmath23  or the details of the gaussian distribution .",
    "similar model light curves could be produced with different @xmath23  values ( within a factor of a few ) , provided that @xmath29 contained in the gaussian distribution remains the same .",
    "this density gradient leads to an abrupt rise in the mass - flow rate at the innermost disk .",
    "the rise phase of the x - ray light curve is produced by the enhanced mass - flow rate to the alfvn radius and subsequently onto the surface of the neutron star . since the exact position of the inner disk radius , , does not change the rate of mass inflow , for simplicity we take  constant and equal to the inner disk radius in quiescence .",
    "the mass accretion rate in the decay phase of the light curve is governed by the viscous relaxation of the inner disk matter . at the end of the decay phase",
    ", the luminosity converges to the quiescent x - ray luminosity level of the source .",
    "the x - ray luminosity produced by the inner disk through viscous dissipation is negligible compared to the luminosity powered by mass accretion onto the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the evolution of the disk is determined by solving the diffusion equation ( see , e.g. frank et al .",
    "2002 ) . while  is important in the evolution of the x - ray luminosity , the detailed shape of the gaussian does not significantly affect the model light curve in the long term ( ertan et al .",
    "2006 ) . for a viscously evolving disk , the power index @xmath36 of the extended surface density profile",
    "is expected to be @xmath37 ( frank et al . 2002 ) ; we take @xmath36 = 3/4 in our calculations .",
    "we keep the inner radius of the disk  constant at a value near the alfvn radius for a dipole magnetic field with strength  = 10@xmath19 g on the surface of the neutron star . since the model fits are not sensitive to , we are not able to constrain .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the value of the outer disk radius  either , since the viscous timescale along the disk is much longer than the enhancement episodes of axps . in our calculations",
    "we take  = 10@xmath38 cm .",
    "irradiation parameter @xmath39 represents the efficiency of x - ray irradiation flux @xmath40 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) where  is the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star .",
    "infrared and optical data of the persistent axps can be accounted for by an active disk model with @xmath39 in the range 10@xmath41  10@xmath42 ( ertan & alikan 2006 ) similar to those estimated for low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "total x - ray luminosity is related to the mass accretion rate through @xmath43 we take @xmath44 = /  = 1 , where  is the mass - flow rate arriving at the innermost radius of the disk . actually , @xmath44 could be less than unity , that is , a fraction of  can escape the system or may not return back to the disk . employing lower @xmath44 values in the calculations",
    "does not change our qualitative results , but requires a modification of some other disk parameters .",
    "this will be discussed in section 4 . for comparison of the model with observations , we take the x - ray luminosities in the observational bands to represent the total x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "different viscosity states prevail in the hot ( @xmath45 ) and cold ( @xmath46 ) regions of the disk . for the kinematic viscosity ,",
    "we use the -prescription ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) with  =   and  =   in the cold and hot viscosity states respectively .",
    "for a review of the dims , see e.g. lasota 2001 .",
    "the disk evolution model we use here is the same as dims of lmxbs and dwarf novae ( dns ) .",
    "the difference is the value of the critical temperature , . in lmxb and dn disks , the thermal - viscous instability operates around the ionization temperature of hydrogen (  @xmath4 10@xmath47 k ) . in the case of axps , both the temperature profile and the chemical composition of the disk",
    "are different from the hydrogen disks of lmxb and dns . in axp disks ,",
    "metallicity is likely to be much higher than in an lmxb disk .",
    "we should also note that the hottest , innermost parts of the lmxb disks do not exist in axp disks due to stronger dipole fields of axps that cut the disk at a relatively larger radius ( @xmath410@xmath48 cm ) .",
    "the critical temperatures depend sensitively on the details of the ionization properties of the disk matter .",
    "independent of these details , if the disk undergoes a global disk instability at a particular temperature , the resultant evolution of the disk produces a light curve which can be easily distinguished from the pure viscous decay curve ( not affected by instabilities ) . furthermore ,",
    "fallback disks around axps are likely to have similar chemical compositions and similar critical temperatures .",
    "in our model , there are five main disk parameters , namely , , , , @xmath36 , and @xmath39 , which govern the evolution of the accretion disk for a given initial mass distribution . among these ,  and @xmath39 are degenerate parameters .",
    "there is a constraint on the range of @xmath39 obtained in our earlier work on the persistent axps ( ertan & alikan 2006 ) .",
    "these basic disk parameters are very likely to have similar values for fallback disks of different axps . in section 2.2",
    ", we investigate the effects of model parameters on the evolution of the disk to clarify the subsequent discussion on the light curves of persistent and transient sources .",
    "observations of x - ray outburst ( enhancement ) light curves of different axps with different energetics and time - scales provide an opportunity for a detailed test of the fallback disk model and also for constraining the model parameters . in this section",
    ", we investigate the effect of important disk parameters on the x - ray outburst light curves of model sources .",
    "soft gamma - ray bursts of axps are likely to have magnetic origin and to occur close to the neutron star . assuming an isotropic emission , a small fraction @xmath49 of the total burst energy , , is absorbed by the disk where   is the part of the burst energy illuminating the disk and @xmath50 is the half - thickness of the disk at @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is roughly constant along the disk and is about 10@xmath42 in the accretion regime of axps .",
    "when the inner disk is pushed back and heated by , part of the inner disk matter could escape the system , while the remaining part piles up , forming a surface density gradient at the inner disk ( see ertan et al .",
    "2006 for details ) . in our model",
    ", the gaussian surface density distribution represents the inner pile - up and the power - law surface density distribution stands for the outer extended disk that is expected to remain unaffected by the soft gamma - ray burst .",
    "the position @xmath23  and the total mass  of the pile - up , for a given , depend on the inner disk radius   and the mass distribution of the inner disk just before the burst event . in steady state ,",
    "the surface density profile of the inner disk - magnetosphere boundary is not well known .",
    "assuming that the inner disk conditions are similar for fallback disks of axps , it is expected that a higher burst energy pushes the inner disk to a larger radius , and creates a greater density gradient at the inner disk .    in the quiescent state , the mass - flow rate , , decays very slowly and therefore can be taken as constant in the models . in this steady state ,",
    "@xmath53 where @xmath54 is a function of temperature and radius , and depends also on the ionization properties of the disk matter .",
    "the pressure - scale height of the disk @xmath55 then @xmath56 ( see , e.g. frank et al . 2002 ) where @xmath57 is the mid - plane temperature of the disk .",
    "the irradiation temperature  @xmath58 modifies the effective temperatures and the stability criteria of the disk without significantly affecting the mid - plane temperatures in the accretion regime of axps and sgrs ( e.g. dubus et al .",
    "then , in the quiescent state , the surface density of the disk @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 with @xmath36 = 3/4 .",
    "the main role of the irradiation is to slow down the decay of the x - ray luminosity , preventing the rapid propagation of the cooling front inward .",
    "this will be investigated in detail in section 2.2.3 .",
    "we first illustrate x - ray enhancement light curves of a model source with different  values representing the evolution of the same source with different burst energies . in the first exercise ,",
    "we compare the model curves without invoking the instability ( pure viscous evolution ) with @xmath62 = 0.1 , = @xmath63 cm , and = @xmath64 cm .",
    "three different illustrative light curves presented in figure 1 are obtained with different  values that give peak luminosities of 1 @xmath65 10@xmath66 , 3 @xmath65 10@xmath66 , and 1 @xmath65 10@xmath67 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "the quiescent  of all these sources are close to 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath7 , a typical luminosity of a persistent axp .",
    "it is seen that the x - ray luminosities follow almost the same decay curve after @xmath4 a few months and eventually reach their quiescent level .",
    "for the first several weeks of the outburst both the fluences and the functional forms of the decay curves are very different from each other .",
    "for this initial decay phase , the model curves can be fit by a power law @xmath69 with power - law indices of 0.88 , 0.68 and 0.46 .",
    "the minimum burst energy imparted to the disk can be estimated from  using @xmath70 for these illustrative models ,  = 4.9 @xmath65 @xmath71 , 2.1 @xmath65 @xmath71 , and 8.9 @xmath65 @xmath72 g , and the estimated  values are 9.2 @xmath65 @xmath73 , 3.8 @xmath65 @xmath73 , and 1.7 @xmath65 @xmath73 erg , respectively .",
    "note that actually a higher  accumulates a greater  at a larger @xmath23 . since the chosen @xmath23  does not significantly affect the light curve , for simplicity , we take @xmath23  constant ( 5 @xmath65 @xmath63 cm ) for all these illustrative simulations .",
    "we repeat the same calculations for a model source with a quiescent luminosity around 10@xmath74 erg s@xmath7 , typical for transient axps . in figure 2",
    ", we present three different light curves produced by pure viscous evolution of the disk for three different   values , without changing the other parameters . in this case ,",
    "estimated  values are 4.5 @xmath65 @xmath75 erg , 2.3 @xmath65 @xmath75 erg and 1.2 @xmath65 @xmath75 erg respectively .",
    "for these sources , first @xmath4 100 days of the decay curves can be fitted by power laws with indices 0.91 , 0.73 , and 0.59 . in figure 2 , like the model sources given in figure 1 , the sources with higher  show higher peak luminosities and sharper decay curves in this early phase of evolution .    in these examples , the model light curves are produced by pure viscous evolution of the disk without any instability . comparing figures 1 and 2 , we might conclude that the sources with similar  in quiescence could show decay curves with rather different power - law indices , while it is also possible that sources with different quiescent luminosities could give similar decay curves in the early decay phase of the outburst . in section 2.2.2 ,",
    "we show that this early phase of the x - ray light curves can indeed be produced by pure viscous evolution of the disk for both transient and persistent sources .",
    "this pure viscous evolution model gives similar long - term curves for all model sources ( figures 1 and 2 ) , which would be the case if there were no critical temperature leading to viscous instability in the disk .",
    "in the following sections , we show how the presence of a critical temperature leads to systematic differences in the functional form of the decay curves depending on the x - ray luminosities in quiescence .",
    "the main characteristics of x - ray outbursts of soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) and dns can be successfully accounted for by dims ( see , e.g. , lasota 2001 for a review ) . in these systems ,",
    "the viscous instability manifests itself at temperatures around 10@xmath47 k which corresponds to the ionization temperature of hydrogen . in the dims ,",
    "disk regions with temperatures higher and colder than this critical temperature are in hot and cold viscosity states respectively .",
    "different @xmath62 parameters are employed in the cold and hot states (  @xmath4 0.1 and  @xmath4 0.01  0.05 , see section 2.2.4 ) to obtain reasonable model fits to the x - ray outburst light curves of sxts and dns .",
    "we note that these viscosities are turbulent in both hot and cold states .",
    "we now investigate the effect of viscous instability with different critical temperatures on the model x - ray light curves of two illustrative sources with quiescent x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath74 and 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath7 as representatives of transient and persistent axps . for both model sources , we take @xmath39 = 1 @xmath65 10@xmath41 .",
    "the results are seen in figure 3 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the luminosity evolution of a persistent source , for three different  values , as well as the pure viscous decay ( no viscous instability ) .",
    "similarly , panel ( b ) shows the evolution of a transient source . for a given source ,",
    "the model curves with higher  values diverge from pure viscous decay curve earlier . comparing figures 3(a ) and ( b )",
    ", we see that for a particular , the light curve of the persistent sources ( high quiescent luminosity ) deviate from the pure viscous decay curve much later than the transient sources ( low quiescent luminosity ) . for instance , for  = 2000 k , the light curve of the transient source deflects from the pure viscous decay curve at @xmath76  @xmath4  100 days . for the persistent source with the same ,",
    "the deviation starts at @xmath76  @xmath4  200 d and the luminosity decreases much slower compared to the transient source . for  @xmath4  1500 k ,",
    "the light curve of the persistent source is indistinguishable from the pure viscous decay until @xmath76  @xmath4  400 days , while for the transient source , the deviation starts as early as @xmath76  @xmath4  200 days ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this characteristic difference in the light curve morphologies of high and low - luminosity axps in the decay phase is mainly due to the differences in the surface density and temperature profile of the disks in the quiescent states .",
    "these properties could be estimated from the x - ray luminosities in quiescence , which scales with the accretion rate onto the neutron star .",
    "another factor that plays an important role in the evolution of the disk and the x - ray luminosity is the x - ray irradiation of the disk .",
    "the irradiation flux can be written as @xmath77 where irradiation efficiency @xmath39 depends on the albedo of the disk faces and the irradiation geometry ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . the critical temperature discussed in section 2.2.2 and",
    "@xmath39 are degenerate parameters .",
    "the results of our earlier work on the x - ray and ir data of axps constrain the value of @xmath39 to the range 10@xmath41  7 @xmath65 10@xmath41 ( ertan & alikan 2006 ) , which remains in the range of the estimated irradiation efficiencies of sxts ( 10@xmath41  10@xmath42 ; de jong et al . 1996 ; dubus et al .",
    "1999 ; tuchman et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the effective temperature of a steady disk at a radial position is determined by the dissipation rate given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is local kepler velocity , and by the x - ray irradiation flux .",
    "including , the effective temperature can be written as @xmath80 since @xmath81 , both  and @xmath82 have the same  ( and thus ) dependence . the irradiation flux and the dissipation rate decrease with radial distance as @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively . equating  to @xmath82 , we find @xmath85 cm which does not depend on . for smaller radii , @xmath82 dominates , while  is the dominant source of heating beyond this radius ( see , e.g. frank et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the radius  of the hot inner disk is determined by the strength of the x - ray irradiation ( @xmath57(@xmath86= ) = ) . increasing ( decreasing )  increases ( decreases ) the effective temperatures at all radii , and",

    "this implies that the sources with higher x - ray luminosity have greater .",
    "this is actually the main reason that leads to different x - ray light curve morphologies in the enhancement phases of transient and persistent sources . the rate of mass accretion which powers  is determined by the surface density profile of the disk .",
    "the sources with higher surface densities have higher accretion rates , higher x - ray irradiation fluxes , and thus greater .",

    "subsequently ,  decreases gradually at a rate governed by the decreasing x - ray flux .    in the quiescent phase , the mass - flow rate at the inner hot disk depends on the conditions at the cold outer disk .",

    "is determined mainly by the viscous processes at the hot inner disk . just before the onset of the x - ray outburst ,",

    "our model calculations show that the idea proposed by ertan & erkut ( 2008 ) to explain the x - ray enhancement light curve of @xmath0 can be extended to other transient axps as well .",
    "this idea could be summarized as follows : there is a critical temperature ,  @xmath4 2000 k , that prevails in the fallback disks of all axps . in the x - ray enhancement phase ,",
    "the viscous instability created at this temperature governs the x - ray luminosity starting from a certain time of the decay phase , depending mainly on the disk properties in quiescence .",
    "the properties of the extended disk , in particular the surface density profile , can be estimated from the x - ray luminosity in quiescence , which is different in low - luminosity transient and high - luminosity persistent axps . because of these differences in the disk properties , the effect of the instability on the decay curve is more pronounced and starts earlier in the transient axps than in persistent axps ( see section 2.2 and figures 3  5 ) .",
    "a self - consistent explanation of the observed x - ray light curves requires that the basic model parameters obtained for the different enhancement light curves of axps should be similar within the uncertainties of the fallback disks .",
    "these basic parameters , which are described in detail in section 2.2 are the viscosity parameters in the cold and hot state of the disk ( , ) , the irradiation parameter ( @xmath39 ) , the critical temperature ( ) and the power index ( @xmath36 ) of the initial surface density profile , @xmath112 of the extended disk .",
    "it is seen in table 1 that these parameters of our model for different axps are either the same or very close to each other . with these parameters ,",
    "the model x - ray light curves for four different transient axps are in good agreement with observations ( figures 6  9 ) .",
    "x - ray enhancement of persistent axps can also be fit well by the pure viscous evolution model ( ertan & alpar 2003 ; ertan et al .",
    "this is consistent with our results , since the critical temperatures found here do not significantly affect the enhancement light curves of persistent axps ( section 2 ) .",
    "the model that we use in the present work was first proposed by ertan & alpar ( 2003 ) for the sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "the only difference in our work is that we introduce a critical temperature ( ) .",
    "it is the presence of this  that leads to viscous instability during the enhancement phase . in the model",
    ", this instability does not produce an x - ray outburst , but changes the evolution of the disk mass - flow rate and thereby the x - ray luminosity in the decay phase of the x - ray enhancement .",
    "in the disk , at temperatures below and above  we use different alpha parameters (  and ) to represent different viscosity states like in the models of sxts . over the decay phase , in the disk",
    ", the radius with @xmath57 =  ( cooling front ) propagates inward as we explained in sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 . in this phase",
    ", the rapid motion of the cooling front with varying x - ray luminosity is a viscous instability since it changes the viscosities along the radii it propagates . on the other hand , in the model",
    ", the observed x - ray enhancement is produced by the mass density and temperature gradients at the inner disk .",
    "the effect of this propagation of the cooling front on the x - ray light curve is remarkably different in low - luminosity transient and high - luminosity persistent systems like sgr 1900 + 14 and this was discussed in detail with illustrative model curves in the paper .",
    "all x - ray enhancement light curves of axp / sgrs mimic the light curve produced by a pure viscous decay in the early phase of evolution , but later , they diverge from the pure viscous decay curve due to ongoing viscous instability in the disk ( figures 35 ) .",
    "the same  exists in all fallback disks , nevertheless the effect of the cooling - front propagation in the decay phase is more prominent and observed earlier from the systems that have lower luminosities in the quiescent state . in the present work",
    ", we also present the model curves produced by pure viscous decay just to show , by comparison , the effect of the instability on the luminosity evolution of the sources .",
    "the fact that ertan & alpar ( 2003 ) can fit to the enhancement light curve of sgr1900 + 14 with a single alpha parameter (  @xmath4 0.1 ) , without using a , indicates that the information from the cooling front could not communicate to the innermost disk during the observation period of this source .",
    "that is , when   with values obtained in our work is inserted in ertan & alpar ( 2003 ) , their model curve does not change .",
    "this shows the self consistency of our results with the earlier work , and could also be tested by the future observations of these sources .",
    "since the critical temperature depends on the details of the chemical composition of fallback disks which is not well known , it could only be estimated from the model fits . considering that this critical temperature must be an intrinsic property of the fallback disks",
    ", its value must be the same in all axp / sgr systems . in the present work",
    ", we also constrain this critical temperature , trying to find solutions that can fit the light curves of all these transient sources with a similar  along with other similar sets of intrinsic disk parameters ( table 1 ) .    in the quiescent state ,",
    "the position of the cooling front remains almost constant and is determined by the current x - ray irradiation flux . in quiescence , back and forth motion of the cooling front in a narrow radial region of the disk could create variations in the local mass - flow rate ( and could still be called viscous instability ) , but those are smoothed out on the way to the alfvn radius and does not cause variations in the x - ray luminosity .",
    "therefore , we expect to observe the effect of the viscous instability in the decay phase of the x - ray luminosity .",
    "we note that , in the present work , we have also refined the model parameters obtained by ertan & erkut ( 2008 ) for @xmath0 considering the newly reported last three data points of this source ( bernardini et al .",
    "illustrative model curves given in ertan & erkut ( 2008 ) can produce the 2  10 kev absorbed data for a particular .",
    "nevertheless , these model curves are seen to remain above the new data points by a factor of three .",
    "we notice that the interstellar absorption significantly affects the light curve of the source close to the quiescent level of the x - ray luminosity . here",
    ", we have repeated the calculations using unabsorbed data including the new data points of the source ( bernardini et al .",
    "2009 ) . for also the other sources , except for @xmath1",

    "; israel et al . 2007 ; woods et al . 2011 ; rea et al . 2009 ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is in the early decay phase of the x - ray outburst ( figure 9 ) , its absorbed data can be safely used to test our model .",
    "the model curves presented in figures 6  9 are obtained with degenerate parameters  = 1750 k and @xmath39  @xmath15 1 @xmath65 10@xmath41 . for the maximum possible value of @xmath39 ( @xmath4 7 @xmath65 10@xmath41 ) , indicated by our earlier work",
    ", reasonable light curves could be obtained by increasing  by a factor of @xmath4 1.6 .",
    "this constrains  to the @xmath4 1700  2800 k range .",
    "this is not a strong constraint , since this result was obtained with a particular @xmath44 = /  = 1 ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "reasonable model curves can also be obtained with lower @xmath44 values ; nevertheless this requires modification of the model parameters .",
    "for instance , using @xmath44 = 0.1 , a model curve that fits well to x - ray enhancement data of @xmath0 can be obtained with  = 0.039 and 1350 k @xmath8  @xmath8 2100 k , corresponding to 1 @xmath65 10@xmath41 @xmath8 @xmath39 @xmath8 7 @xmath65 10@xmath41 .    in figures 6  9 , we also give the estimated mass  of the pile - up for each of the sources .",
    "our results sensitively depend on . estimated amount of burst energy  imparted to the inner disk depends on ,  and @xmath23",
    ". relative positions of  and @xmath23  also affect the model light curves , while similar results could be obtained with different  values , adjusting @xmath23  and surface density without changing .",
    "there is an uncertainty in estimated  because of the uncertainties in  and surface density profile of the innermost disk in quiescence .    in the case of sgr 0501 + 4516",
    ", the distance is rather unconstrained ( see section 3 ) .",
    "this source seems to be in the early phase of evolution , at a time the information from the cooling front has not reached the innermost disk by the viscous processes yet .",
    "this is the phase over which the light curve mimics that of a pure viscous decay . that is",
    ", changing the initial surface density profile at all radii by a constant multiplicative factor , it is possible to obtain different model light curves that have the same functional forms that differ only in amplitudes .",
    "since any change in distance will modify all data points with the same multiplicative factor , we can obtain a similar model fit without modifying the intrinsic disk parameters .",
    "nevertheless , after the viscous instability deviates the light curve from that of pure viscous decay , any correction in distances could require a modification of the critical temperature parameter to obtain a similar model fit to data , or possibly the model could fail in producing the observed light curve .",
    "we should also note the possibilities of different burst geometries .",
    "we assume that the soft gamma - ray burst energy is emitted isotropically .",
    "this might not be the case , at least for some of the bursts .",
    "for instance , only a certain angular segment of the disk could be illuminated by the burst energy .",
    "this leads to a rather different post - burst surface density profile than we assume here . even in this case , the resultant enhancement light curves are likely to be similar to those produced by an isotropic burst , provided that the burst creates a sufficient surface density gradient .",
    "these possibilities put further uncertainties on the estimated burst energy .",
    "for instance , in some cases it is possible that we observe an x - ray enhancement without observing the triggering burst whose anisotropic emission pattern evaded us .",
    "another possibility is that we could observe bursts that are not followed by an enhancement in x - rays , if the solid angle of this particular burst does not cross the disk .",
    "independent of the details of burst geometries , subsequent x - ray outburst light curves of different axps provide a good test for the fallback disk model . for given quiescent and peak x - ray luminosities in an enhancement phase",
    ", there is a single decay curve estimated by the disk model .",
    "to put it in other words , all the observed enhancement light curves of axps should be reproduced by a single set of main disk parameters .    in comparison of the model curves with data ,",
    "there are some uncertainties that we encounter at very low luminosities (  @xmath4 10@xmath74 erg s@xmath7 ) : ( 1 ) due to very low temperatures , a significant fraction of the x - ray luminosity of the source is expected to be emitted below the observed x - ray band that we take to represent the total luminosity of the source . ( 2 ) absorption effects considerably increase for the soft radiation emitted at these low temperatures .",
    "( 3 ) depending on the age , the cooling luminosity of the source could have significant contribution to the total quiescent luminosity of the source .",
    "( 4 ) it is possible that some small bursts could be emitted in the decay phases and affect the secular decay characteristics of the light curves .",
    "it is not possible to address these effects in the model .",
    "for instance , the data point that remains above the model light curve of sgr 1627 - 41 ( figure 7 ) might be due to such a small burst .    within these uncertainties ,",
    "our model curves are in agreement with the x - ray enhancement data of four transient axps ( figures 6  9 ) .",
    "we have succeeded to obtain reasonable model curves with almost the same basic disk parameters , given in table 1 .",
    "we have shown that the x - ray outburst ( enhancement ) light curves of axps and sgrs can be explained by the evolution of an irradiated disk after the inner disk is pushed back to larger radii by a soft gamma - ray burst .",
    "a viscous instability created at a critical temperature , , seems to be a common property of all axp / sgr disks . for the extreme values of x - ray irradiation efficiency obtained from our earlier work ( ertan & alikan 2006 )",
    ", we estimate that  is in 1300  2800 k range .",
    "characteristic differences between the enhancement light curves of transient and persistent axp / sgrs can naturally be accounted for by their different pre - burst ( quiescent ) conditions of the disks implied by the x - ray luminosity of the sources in quiescence .",
    "x - ray outburst light curve of a persistent axp / sgr could not be distinguished from a light curve produced by a pure viscous ( without any instability ) evolution of the disk for a few years . for a transient source ,",
    "the outburst light curve could diverge from the pure viscous evolution within months after the onset of the outburst ( figures 6  9 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with our earlier work on the x - ray outburst light curves of persistent axp / sgrs ( see , e.g. , ertan et al 2006 ) which were explained by pure viscous evolution of the disk .",

    "<S> there is a characteristic difference between the x - ray outburst light curves of transient and persistent sources . </S>",
    "<S> this can be explained by the differences in the disk surface - density profiles of the transient and persistent sources in quiescence indicated by their quiescent x - ray luminosities . </S>",

    "<S> the effect of the instability is more pronounced and starts earlier for the sources with lower quiescent luminosities , which leads to the observable differences in the x - ray enhancement light curves of transient and persistent sources . </S>",
    "<S> a single active disk model with the same basic disk parameters can account for the enhancement phases of both transient and persistent axps and sgrs . </S>",
