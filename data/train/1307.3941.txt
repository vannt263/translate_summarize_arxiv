    "a desirable goal of a psychological theory is to offer explanations grounded on elementary principles to the data available from psychology experiments @xcite .",
    "although most of these quantitative psychological data is related to mental chronometry , recent explorations on the human performance to acquire an artificial lexicon in controlled laboratory conditions have paved the way to the understanding of the learning strategies humans use to infer a word - object mapping @xcite .",
    "these experiments are based on the cross - situational word - learning paradigm which avers that a learner can determine the meaning of a word by finding something in common across all observed uses of that word @xcite . in that sense",
    ", learning takes place through the statistical sampling of the contexts in which a word appears in accord with the classical associationist stance of hume and locke that the mechanism of word learning is sensitivity to covariation - if two events occur at the same time , they become associated @xcite .    in a typical cross - situational word - learning experiment ,",
    "participants are exposed repeatedly to multiple unfamiliar objects concomitantly with multiple spoken pseudo - words , such that a word and its correct referent ( object ) always appear together on a learning trial .",
    "different trials exhibiting distinct word - object pairs will eventually allow the disambiguation of the word - object associations and the learning of the correct mapping @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that this scenario does not describe the actual word learning process by children even in the unambiguous situation where the single novel object is followed by the utterance of its corresponding pseudo - word .",
    "in fact , young children will only make the connection between the object and the word provided they have a reason to believe that they are in presence of an act of naming and for this the speaker has to be present @xcite .",
    "adults could learn those associations either because they were previously instructed by the experimenter that they would be learning which words go with which objects or because they could infer that the disembodied voice is an act of naming by a concealed person .",
    "nevertheless , the sort of statistical learning assumed in the cross - situational word - learning scenario may play a key role in the development of pidgin @xcite and it is likely the sole option for the autonomous learning of a lexicon by robots @xcite .    in order to learn a word - object mapping within the cross - situational word - learning scenario the learner should be able to ( i ) recall at least a fraction of the word - object pairings that appeared in the learning trials , ( ii ) register both co - occurrences and non - co - occurrences of words and objects and ( iii ) apply the mutual exclusivity principle which favors the association of novel words to novel objects @xcite .",
    "although a variety of rule - based and associative learning algorithms has been proposed to model cross - situational word learning @xcite , none of them explicitly take into account processes that regulate all three above - mentioned criteria .    in this paper",
    "we offer an adaptive learning algorithm that comprises two parameters which regulate the associative reinforcement of pairings between concurrent words and objects , and the non - associative inference process that handles built - in biases ( e.g. , mutual exclusivity ) as well as information of past learning events . by setting the values of these parameters",
    "so as to fit a representative selection of experimental data presented in @xcite we are able to identify and explain the learning strategies adopted by the participants of those experiments in terms of a trade - off between reinforcement and inference .",
    "we assume there are @xmath0 objects @xmath1 , @xmath0 words @xmath2 and a one - to - one mapping between words and objects represented by the set @xmath3 . at each learning trial ,",
    "@xmath4 word - object pairs are selected from @xmath5 and presented to the learner without providing any clue on which word goes with which object .",
    "for instance , pictures of the @xmath4 objects are displayed in a slide while @xmath4 pseudo - words are spoken sequentially such that their spatial and temporal arrangements do not give away the correct word - object associations @xcite .",
    "we refer to the subset of words and their referents ( objects ) presented to the learner in a learning trial as the context @xmath6 .",
    "the context size @xmath4 is then a measure of the within - trial ambiguity , i.e. , the number of co - occurring word - object pairs per learning trial .",
    "the selection procedure from the set @xmath5 , which may favor some particular subsets of word - object pairs , determines the different experimental setups discussed in this paper .",
    "although each individual trial is highly ambiguous , repetition of trials with partially overlapping contexts should in principle allow the learning of the @xmath0 word - object associations .",
    "after the training stage is completed , which typically comprises about two dozen trials , the learning accuracy is measured by instructing the learner to pick the object among the @xmath0 objects on display which the learner thinks is associated to a particular target word .",
    "the test is repeated for all @xmath0 words and the average learning accuracy calculated as the fraction of correct guesses @xcite .",
    "this cross - situational learning scenario does not account for the presence of noise , such as the effect of out - of - context words .",
    "this situation can be modeled by assuming that there is a certain probability ( noise ) that the referent of one of the spoken words is not part of the context ( so that word can be said to be out of context ) .",
    "although theoretical analysis shows that there is a maximum noise intensity beyond which statistical learning is unattainable @xcite , as yet no experiment was carried out to verify the existence of this threshold phenomenon on the learning performance of human subjects .",
    "we model learning as a change in the confidence with which the algorithm ( or , for simplicity , the learner ) associates the word @xmath7 to an object @xmath8 that results from the observation and analysis of the contexts presented in the learning trials .",
    "more to the point , this confidence is represented by the probability @xmath9 that @xmath7 is associated to @xmath8 at learning trial @xmath10 .",
    "this probability is normalized such that @xmath11 for all @xmath7 and @xmath10 , which then implies that when the word @xmath7 is presented to the learner in the testing stage the learning accuracy is given simply by @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , we assume that @xmath9 contains information presented in the learning trials up to and including trial @xmath10 only .    if at learning trial @xmath10 the learner observes the context @xmath13 then it can infer the existence of two other informative sets .",
    "first , the set of the words ( and their referents ) that appear for the first time at trial @xmath10 , which we denote by @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "second , the set of words ( and their referents ) that do not appear in @xmath17 but that have already appeared in the previous trials , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of different words that appeared in contexts up to and including trial @xmath10 . clearly , @xmath20 .",
    "the update rule of the confidences @xmath9 depends on which of these three sets the word @xmath7 and the object @xmath8 belong to ( if @xmath21 they may belong to different sets ) .",
    "in fact , our learning algorithm comprises a parameter @xmath22 $ ] that measures the associative reinforcement capacity and applies only to known words that appear in the current context , and a parameter @xmath23 $ ] that measures the inference capacity and applies either to known words that do not appear in the current context or to new words in the current context .",
    "before the experiment begins ( @xmath24 ) we set @xmath25 for all words @xmath26 and objects @xmath27 .",
    "next we describe how the confidences are updated following the sequential presentation of contexts .    in the first trial ( @xmath28 ) all words are new ( @xmath29 ) , so we set @xmath30 for @xmath31 . in the second or in an arbitrary trial",
    "@xmath10 we expect to observe contexts exhibiting both novel and repeated words .",
    "novel words must go through an inference preprocessing stage before the reinforcement procedure can be applied to them .",
    "this is so because if @xmath32 appears for the first time at trial @xmath10 then @xmath33 for all objects @xmath8 and since the reinforcement is proportional to @xmath34 the confidences associated to @xmath32 would never be updated ( see eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) and the explanation thereafter ) .",
    "thus when a novel word @xmath32 appear at trial @xmath35 , we redefine its confidence values at the previous trial ( originally set to zero ) as @xmath36 on the one hand , setting the inference parameter @xmath37 to its maximum value @xmath38 enforces the mutual exclusivity principle which requires that the new word @xmath32 be associated with equal probability to the @xmath39 new objects @xmath40 in the current context .",
    "hence in the case @xmath41 the meaning of the new word would be inferred in a single presentation . on the other hand , for @xmath42 the new word",
    "is associated with equal probability to all objects already seen up to an including trial @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath37 describe a situation of imperfect inference .",
    "note that using eqs .",
    "( [ new_1])-([new_3 ] ) we can easily verify that @xmath44 , in accord with the normalization constraint .",
    "now we can focus on the update rule of the confidence @xmath45 in the case both word @xmath7 and object @xmath8 appear in the context at trial @xmath10 .",
    "the rule applies both to repeated and novel words , provided the confidences of the novel words are preprocessed according to eqs .",
    "( [ new_1])-([new_3 ] ) . in order to fulfill automatically the normalization condition for word @xmath7 ,",
    "the increase of the confidence @xmath45 with @xmath46 must be compensated by the decrease of the confidences @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "this can be implemented by distributing evenly the total flux of probability out of the latter confidences , i.e. , @xmath49 , over the confidences @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "hence the net gain of confidence on the association between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is given by @xmath50 where , as mentioned before , the parameter @xmath51 $ ] measures the strength of the reinforcement process .",
    "note that if both @xmath8 and @xmath52 appear in the context together with @xmath7 then the reinforcement procedure should not create any distinction between the associations @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this result is achieved provided that the ratio of the confidence gains equals the ratio of the confidences before reinforcement , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "this is the reason that the reinforcement gain of a word - object association given by eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) is proportional to the previous confidence on that association .",
    "the total increase in the confidences between @xmath7 and the objects that appear in the context , i.e. @xmath56 , equals the product of @xmath57 and the total decrease in the confidences between @xmath7 and the objects that do not appear in the context , i.e. @xmath49 . so for @xmath58 the confidences associated to objects absent from the context are fully transferred to the confidences associated to objects present in the context .",
    "lower values of @xmath57 allows us to control the flow of confidence from objects in @xmath59 to objects in @xmath17 .",
    "most importantly , in order to implement the reinforcement process the learner should be able to use the information about the previous trials , which is condensed on the confidence values @xmath60 . the efficiency on the usage of this information is quantified by the word and trial dependent quantity @xmath61 $ ] that allows for the interpolation between the cases of perfect usage ( @xmath62 ) and complete neglect ( @xmath63 ) of the information stored in the confidences @xmath60 . in particular , we assume that the greatest the certainty on the association between word @xmath7 and its referent , the more efficiently that information is used by the learner . a quantitative measure of the uncertainty associated to the confidences regarding word @xmath7 is given by the entropy @xmath64\\ ] ] whose maximum ( @xmath65 ) is obtained by the uniform distribution @xmath66 for all @xmath67 , and whose minimum ( @xmath68 ) by @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "so we define @xmath72,\\ ] ] where @xmath73 $ ] is a baseline efficiency corresponding to the maximum uncertainty about the referent of a target word .    finally , recalling that at trial @xmath10 the learner has access to the sets @xmath17 , @xmath59 as well as to the confidences at trial @xmath74 we write the update rule @xmath75 \\left [ \\frac{1}{n_{t } } - p_{t-1 } \\left ( w_{i } , o_{j } \\right ) \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath76 .",
    "note that if @xmath77 the learner would associate word @xmath7 to all objects that have appeared up to and including trial @xmath10 with equal probability .",
    "this situation happens only if @xmath78 and if there is complete uncertainty about the referent of word @xmath7 .",
    "now we consider the update rule for the confidence @xmath47 in the case that word @xmath7 appears in the context at trial @xmath10 but object @xmath79 does not .",
    "( we recall that object @xmath79 must have appeared in some previous trial . )",
    "according to the reasoning that led to eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) this confidence must decrease by the amount @xmath80 and so , taking into account the information efficiency factor , we obtain @xmath81 \\left [ \\frac{1}{n_{t } } - p_{t-1 } \\left ( w_{i } , \\bar{o}_{j } \\right ) \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be easily seen to satisfy the normalization @xmath82 we focus now on the update rule for the confidence @xmath83 with @xmath84 , i.e. , both the word @xmath85 and the object @xmath79 are absent from the context shown at trial @xmath10 , but they have already appeared , not necessarily together , in previous trials . a similar inference reasoning that led to the expressions for",
    "the preprocessing of new words would allow the learner to conclude that a word absent from the context should be associated to an object that is also absent from it . in that sense ,",
    "confidence should flow from the associations between @xmath85 and objects @xmath86 to the associations between @xmath85 and objects @xmath87 . hence , ignoring the information efficiency factor for the moment , the net gain to confidence @xmath88 is given by @xmath89 the direct proportionality of this gain to @xmath90 can be justified by an argument similar to that used to justify eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) in the case of reinforcement .",
    "the information efficiency issue is also handled in a similar manner so the desired update rule reads @xmath91 \\ !",
    "\\left [ \\frac{1}{n_{t } } - p_{t-1 } \\ !",
    "\\left ( \\bar{w}_{i } , \\bar{o}_{j } \\right ) \\!\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath92 . to ensure normalization",

    "we can verify that prescriptions ( [ pbwbo ] ) and ( [ pbwo ] ) satisfy the normalization @xmath97 as expected .    in summary , before any trial ( @xmath24 ) we set all confidence values to zero , i.e. @xmath98 , and fix the values of the parameters @xmath99 , @xmath57 and @xmath37 .",
    "in the first trial ( @xmath28 ) we set the confidences of the words and objects in @xmath100 according to eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) , so we have the values of @xmath101 for @xmath102 . in the second trial , we separate the novel words @xmath103 and reset @xmath104 with @xmath105 according to eqs .",

    "knowledge of the confidence values @xmath116 allows us to answer any question posed in the testing stage .    in the next section",
    "we evaluate the adequacy of this algorithm to describe a selection of cross - situational word - learning experiments carried out on adult subjects by @xcite .",
    "the cross - situational word - learning experiments of @xcite aimed to understand how word sampling frequency ( i.e. , number of trials a word appears ) , contextual diversity ( i.e. , the co - occurrence of distinct words or groups of words in the learning trials ) , within - trial ambiguity ( i.e. , the context size @xmath4 ) , and fast - mapping of novel words affect the learning performance of adult subjects . in this section",
    "we compare the performance of the algorithm described in the previous section with the performance of adult subjects reported in @xcite .",
    "in particular , once the conditions of the training stage are specified , we carry out @xmath117 runs of our algorithm for fixed values of the three parameters @xmath99 , @xmath37 , @xmath57 , and then calculate the average accuracy at trial @xmath115 over all those runs for that parameter setting . since the algorithm is deterministic , what changes in each run is the composition of the contexts at each learning trial .",
    "as our goal is to model the results of the experiments , we search the space of parameters to find the setting such that the performance of the algorithm matches that of humans within the error bars ( i.e. , one standard deviation ) of the experiments .      in these experiments the number of words ( and objects )",
    "is @xmath118 and the training stage totals @xmath119 learning trials , with each trial comprising the presentation of 4 words together with their referents ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we investigate two conditions which differ with respect to the number of times a word is exhibited in the training stage . in the two - frequency condition , the 18 words are divided into two subsets of 9 words each .",
    "the words in the first subset appear 9 times and those in the second only 3 times . in the three - frequency condition ,",
    "the 18 words are divided into three subsets of 6 words each .",
    "words in the first subset appear 3 times , in the second , 6 times and in the third , 9 times . in these two conditions ,",
    "the same word was not allowed to appear in two consecutive learning trials .",
    "* figures [ fig:1 ] * and * [ fig:2 ] * summarize our main results for the two - frequency and three - frequency conditions , respectively .",
    "the left panels show the regions ( shaded areas ) in the @xmath121 plane for fixed @xmath99 where the algorithm describes the experimental data .",
    "the middle panels show the accuracy of the best fit as function of the parameter @xmath99 and the right panels exhibit the values of @xmath57 and @xmath37 corresponding to that fit .",
    "the broken horizontal lines and the shaded zones around them represent the means and standard deviations of the results of experiments carried out with 33 adult subjects @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that although the words sampled more frequently are learned best in the two - frequency condition as expected , this advantage practically disappears in the three - frequency condition in which case all words are learned at equal levels within the experimental error .",
    "note that the average accuracy for the words sampled 3 times is actually greater than the accuracy for the words sampled 6 times , but this inversion is not statistically significant , although , most surprisingly , the algorithm does reproduce it for @xmath122 $ ] . according to @xcite , the reason for the observed sampling frequency insensitivity might be because the high - frequency words are learned quickly and once they",
    "are learned subsequent trials containing those words will exhibit an effectively smaller within - trial ambiguity . in this vein ,",
    "the inversion could be explained if by chance the words less frequently sampled were generally paired with the highly sampled words .",
    "thus contextual diversity seems to play a key role in cross - situational word learning .      in the first experiment aiming to probe the role of contextual diversity in the cross - situational learning , the 18 words were divided in two groups of 6 and 12 words each , and the contexts of size @xmath123 were formed with words belonging to the same group only .",
    "since the sampling frequency was fixed to 6 repetitions for each word , those words belonging to the more numerous group are exposed to a larger contextual diversity ( i.e. , the variety of different words with which a given word appear in the course of the training stage ) .",
    "the results summarized in * figure [ fig:3 ] * indicate clearly that contextual diversity enhances the learning accuracy .",
    "perhaps more telling is the finding that incorrect responses are largely due to misassignments to referents whose words belong to the same group of the test word . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that this type of error accounts for 56% of incorrect answers when the test word belongs to the 6-components subgroup and for 76% when it belongs to the 12-components subgroup .",
    "the corresponding statistics for our algorithm with the optimal parameters set at @xmath124 are 43% and 70% , respectively .",
    "the region in the space of parameters where the model can be said to describe the experimental data is greatly reduced in this experiment and even the best fit is barely within the error bars .",
    "it is interesting that , contrasting with the previous experiments , in this case the reinforcement procedure seems to play the more important role in the performance of the algorithm .",
    "the effect of the context size or within - trial ambiguity is addressed by the experiment summarized in * figure [ fig:4 ] * , which is similar to the previous experiment , except that the words that compose the context are chosen uniformly from the entire repertoire of @xmath125 words .",
    "two context sizes are considered , namely , @xmath123 and @xmath120 . in both cases",
    ", there is a large selection of parameter values that explain the experimental data , yielding results indistinguishable from the experimental average accuracies .",
    "this is the reason we do not exhibit a graph akin to those shown in the right panels of the previous figures . since a perfect fitting",
    "can be obtained both for @xmath126 and for @xmath127 , this experiment is uninformative with respect to these two abilities .",
    "as expected , increase of the within - trial ambiguity difficilitate learning .",
    "in addition , the ( experimental ) results for @xmath123 yield a learning accuracy value that is intermediary to those measured for the 6 and 12-components subgroups , which is in agreement with the conclusion that the increase of the contextual diversity enhances learning , since the mean number of different co - occurring words is @xmath128 in the 6-components subgroup , @xmath129 in the 12-components subgroup and @xmath130 in the uniformly mixed situation @xcite .                the experiments carried out by @xcite were designed to elicit participants use of the mutual exclusivity principle ( i.e. , the assumption of one - to - one mappings between words and referents ) and to test the flexibility of a learned word - object association when new evidence is provided in support to a many - to - many mapping . to see how mutual exclusivity implies fast mapping assume that a learner who knows the association @xmath131 is exposed to the context @xmath132 in which the word @xmath133 ( and its referent ) appears for the first time .",
    "then it is clear that a mutual - exclusivity - biased learner would infer the association @xmath134 in this single trial .",
    "however , a purely associative learner would give equal weights to @xmath135 and @xmath136 if asked about the referent of @xmath133 .",
    "in the specific experiment we address in this section , @xmath137 words and their referents are split up into two groups of 6 words each , say @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the context size is set to @xmath140 and the training stage is divided in two phases . in the early phase ,",
    "only the words belonging to group @xmath141 are presented and the duration of this phase is set such that each word is repeated 3 , 6 or 9 times . in the late phase , the contexts consist of one word belonging to @xmath141 and one belonging to @xmath142 forming fixed couples , i.e. , whenever @xmath7 appears in a context , @xmath143 , with @xmath144 , must appear too .",
    "the duration of the late phase depends on the number of repetitions of each word that can be 3 , 6 , or 9 as in the early phase @xcite .",
    "the combinations of the sampling frequencies yield 9 different training conditions but here we will consider only the case that the late phase comprises 6 repetitions of each word .",
    "the testing stage comprises the play of a single word , say @xmath145 , and the display of 11 of the 12 trained objects @xcite .",
    "each word was tested twice with a time lag between the tests : once without its corresponding early object ( @xmath135 in the case ) and once without its late object ( @xmath146 in the case ) .",
    "this procedure requires that we renormalize the confidences for each test .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath135 is left out of the display , the renormalization is @xmath147 with @xmath148 so that @xmath149 .",
    "similarly , in the case @xmath146 is left out the renormalization becomes @xmath150 with @xmath151 so that @xmath152 .",
    "we are interested on the ( renormalized ) confidences @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 , which are shown in * figures [ fig:5 ] * and * [ fig:6 ] * for the conditions where words @xmath157 are repeated 3 ( left panel ) , 6 ( middle panel ) , and 9 ( right panel ) times in the early learning phase , and the words @xmath158 are repeated 6 times in the late phase .",
    "the figures exhibit the performance of the algorithm for the set of parameters @xmath57 and @xmath37 that fits best the experimental data of @xcite for fixed @xmath99 .",
    "this optimum set is shown in * figure [ fig:7 ] * for the 6 early repetition condition , which is practically indistinguishable from the optima of the other two conditions .",
    "the conditions with the different word repetitions in the early phase intended to produce distinct confidences on the learned association @xmath159 before the onset of the late phase in the training stage .",
    "the insensitivity of the results to these conditions probably indicates that association was already learned well enough with 3 repetitions only .",
    "finally , we note that , though the testing stage focused on words @xmath145 and @xmath160 only , all word pairs @xmath7 and @xmath143 with @xmath161 are strictly equivalent since they appear the same number of times during the training stage .",
    "( reinforcement strength ) and @xmath37 ( inference strength ) corresponding to the best fit shown in figures [ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] in the case word @xmath145 is repeated 6 times in the early training phase . ]",
    "the experimental results exhibited in * figure [ fig:6 ] * offer indirect evidence that the participants have resorted to mutual exclusivity to produce their word - object mappings .",
    "in fact , from the perspective of a purely associative learner , word @xmath160 should be associated to objects @xmath135 or @xmath146 only , but since in the testing stage one of those objects was not displayed , such a learner would surely select the correct referent .",
    "however , the finding that @xmath155 is considerably greater than @xmath156 ( they should be equal for an associative learner ) indicates that there is a bias against the association @xmath162 which is motivated , perhaps , from the previous understanding that @xmath135 was the referent of word @xmath145 .",
    "in fact , a most remarkable result revealed by * figure [ fig:6 ] * is that @xmath163 .",
    "since word @xmath160 appeared only in the late phase context @xmath164 and object @xmath135 was not displayed in the testing stage , we must conclude that the participants produced spurious associations between words and objects that never appeared together in a context .",
    "our algorithm accounts for these associations through eq .",

    "accordingly , we assume that the completion of that task requires the existence of two cognitive abilities , namely , the associative capacity to create and reinforce associations between words and referents that co - occur in a context , and the non - associative capacity to infer word - object associations based on previous learning events , which accounts for the mutual exclusivity principle , among other things . in order to regulate the effectiveness of these two capacities we introduce the parameters",

    "in fact , our first choice was to use a constant information efficiency ( i.e. , @xmath170 ) with which we were able to describe only the experiments summarized in * figures [ fig:1 ] * and * [ fig:4 ] * ( data not shown ) . note that a consequence of prescription ( [ alpha ] ) is that once the referent of a word is learned with maximum confidence ( i.e. , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 ) it is never forgotten .",
    "the algorithm described in section [ sec : model ] comprises three free parameters @xmath57 , @xmath37 and @xmath99 which are adjusted so as to fit a representative selection of the experimental data presented in @xcite .",
    "a robust result from all experiments is that the baseline information efficiency is in the range @xmath171 .",
    "actually , the fast mapping experiments narrow this interval down to @xmath172 .",
    "this is a welcome result because we do not have a clear - cut interpretation for @xmath99  it encompasses storage , processing and transmission of information  and so the fact that this parameter does not vary much for wildly distinct experimental settings is evidence that , whatever its meaning , it is not relevant to explain the learning strategies used in the different experimental conditions .",
    "fortunately , this is not the case for the two other parameters @xmath57 and @xmath37 .",
    "for instance , in the fast mapping experiments discussed in subsection [ sub : fast ] the best fit of the experimental data is achieved for @xmath173 indicating thus the extensive use of mutual exclusivity , and inference in general , by the participants of those experiments . moreover , in that case the best fit corresponds to a low ( but nonzero ) value of @xmath57 , which is expected since for contexts that exhibit two associations ( @xmath140 ) only , most of the disambiguations are likely to be achieved solely through inference .",
    "this contrasts with the experiments on variable word sampling frequencies discussed in subsection [ sub : freq ] , for which the best fit is obtained with intermediate values of @xmath37 and @xmath57 so the participants use of reinforcement and inference was not too unbalanced .",
    "the contextual diversity experiment of subsection [ sub : div ] , in which the words are segregated in two isolated groups of 12 and 6 components , offers another extreme learning situation , since the best fit corresponds to @xmath174 and @xmath175 in that case . to understand this result",
    ", first we recall that most of the participants errors were due to misassignments of referents belonging to the same group of the test word , and those confidences were strengthened mainly by the reinforcement process .",
    "second , in contrast to the inference process , which creates and strengthens spurious intergroup associations via eq .",
    "( [ pbwbo ] ) , the reinforcement process solely weakens those associations via eq .",
    "( [ pwbo ] ) .",
    "thus , considering the learning conditions of the contextual diversity experiment it is no surprise that reinforcement was the participants choice strategy .",
    "our results agree with the findings of @xcite that participants use various learning strategies , which in our case are determined by the values of the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath37 , depending on the specific conditions of the cross - situational word - learning experiment . in particular , in the case of low within - trial ambiguity those authors found that participants generally resorted to a rigorous eliminative approach to infer the correct word - object mapping .",
    "this is exactly the conclusion we reached in the analysis of the fast mapping experiment for which the within - trial ambiguity takes the lowest possible value ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "although the adaptive learning algorithm presented in this paper reproduced the performance of adult participants in cross - situational word - learning experiments quite successfully , the deterministic nature of the algorithm hindered somewhat the psychological interpretation of the information efficiency factor @xmath169 .",
    "in fact , not only learning and behavior are best described as stochastic processes @xcite but also the modeling of those processes requires ( and facilitates ) a precise interpretation of the model parameters , since they are introduced in the model as transition probabilities .",
