    "the connection between random matrix theory and number theory began with the work of montgomery @xcite when he conjectured that the distribution of the complex zeros of the riemann zeta function follows the same statistics as the eigenvalues of a random matrix chosen from @xmath3 generated uniformly with respect to haar measure .",
    "this conjecture is supported by numerical evidence @xcite and also by further work @xcite suggesting that the same conjecture is true for more general @xmath2-functions .",
    "for all these @xmath2-functions there is a generalized riemann hypothesis that the non - trivial zeros lie on a vertical line in the complex plane .",
    "the conjectures mentioned above concern the statistics of the zeros high on this critical line .",
    "the philosophy of katz and sarnak @xcite extended the connection with random matrix theory by proposing that rather than averaging over many zeros of a given @xmath2-function , if the zeros near to the point where the critical line crosses the real axis are averaged over a family of naturally connected @xmath2-functions , then they will be found to follow the statistics of the eigenvalues of one of the three classical compact groups of random matrices : @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 , where again the statistics are computed with respect to the probability measure given by haar measure .",
    "there is numerical evidence for this conjecture as well @xcite , and strong support is given to it by the rigorous work of katz and sarnak in the case of function field zeta functions .",
    "for a review of applications of random matrix theory to questions in number theory see , for example , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "there has been a series of papers , starting with @xcite and continuing with @xcite , examining how random matrix theory can be used to predict the distribution of values of the riemann zeta function and other @xmath2-functions , either averaged over an interval high on the critical line , or over a family at the critical point where the critical line crosses the real axis . for large values of the natural asymptotic parameter , for example the variable ordering the @xmath2-functions within the family ,",
    "the moments of @xmath2-functions are conjectured to split into a product of an arithmetic contribution , determined by the family being averaged over , and a component derived from a random matrix calculation - the corresponding moment of the characteristic polynomial of the matrices in one of the three matrix groups @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the asymptotic parameter on the random matrix side is the dimension of the matrix @xmath6 and a natural equivalence can be made between the two .",
    "as will be reviewed in the following section , this conjecture for the leading order behaviour of moments of @xmath2-functions has been used by conrey , keating , rubinstein and snaith @xcite to predict the frequency , within a family of elliptic curves , of an @xmath2-function taking the value zero at the critical point .",
    "this is done by using random matrix theory to predict the value distribution of the @xmath2-values at the critical point and then the discretization of these values @xcite to calculate a probability of the @xmath2-value being zero .",
    "see also david , fearnley and kisilevsky @xcite for a similar use of random matrix theory to predict frequency of vanishing at the critical point amongst families of elliptic curve @xmath2-functions twisted by cubic characters .",
    "in section [ sect : derivdist ] we calculate the value distribution of the first non - zero derivative of the characteristic polynomial at the point one ( corresponding to the value at the critical point in the analogy with @xmath2-functions ) when a given number of eigenvalues are conditioned to lie at the point one .",
    "we find , at equation ( [ eq : delaunay ] ) , that moment of the @xmath1th derivative grows like @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the characteristic polynomial of @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the barnes double gamma function ( see [ eq : g ] ) and the angle brackets denote an average over the set of matrices from @xmath0 with @xmath1 eigenvalues lying at the point one ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we also show that the probability that @xmath12 over those @xmath13 with @xmath1 eigenvalues at 1 ( again , @xmath11 ) is , for small @xmath14 , given by ( see ( [ eq : nrzero ] ) and the sentence following ) @xmath15 for the function @xmath16 given at ( [ eq : f ] ) .",
    "if a discretization of the values of derivatives of @xmath2-functions at the critical point were known , this would provide a way to predict the frequency of zeros of various orders occurring at this point .",
    "this has been investigated in the case of a single zero at the critical point @xcite .",
    "in this situation , @xmath17 , the results of @xcite give support to the validity of the model presented here .    the result presented in section [",
    "sect : derivdist ] on the moments of the first derivative of characteristic polynomials from @xmath18 ( equation [ eq : introdel ] with @xmath17 ) has already been applied by delaunay in @xcite in order to predict the moments of the orders of tate - shafarevich groups and regulators of elliptic curves with odd rank belonging to a family of quadratic twists .    in section [",
    "sect : evaluestats ] , we briefly discuss the eigenvalue statistics of random matrices with a certain number of eigenvalues conditioned to lie at one .",
    "we note that while we believe that the model presented in section [ sect : derivdist ] should apply to the @xmath2-functions selected from families of quadratic twists of elliptic curves for the property that they have high order zeros at the critical point , there has been some very interesting theoretical work computing the one- and two - level densities for parametric families of elliptic curves that implies that the zeros of the associated @xmath2-functions follow a different model ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this does not seem to be a contradiction , as the zero statistics are examined over collections of @xmath2-functions selected in very different ways , but it certainly makes the question of the zero statistics of @xmath2-functions with high - order zeros at the critical point very intriguing . see section [ sect : discussion ] for further discussion on this issue .",
    "we review here the results of @xcite which apply random matrix theory to predicting the frequency of vanishing at the critical point of the @xmath2-functions in the family of elliptic curves described below ; or equivalently , assuming the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture , the frequency of rank 2 or higher curves occurring in the family of elliptic curves .",
    "the motivation for the random matrix calculations presented in section [ sect : derivdist ] is the expectation that they may be used similarly to examine curves of higher rank .",
    "we consider an @xmath2-function ( defined by the dirichlet series and euler product below when @xmath19 ) @xmath20 that is associated to an elliptic curve @xmath21 over @xmath22 @xmath23 the coefficients @xmath24 , for prime @xmath25 , are determined by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 counts the number of pairs @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 , plus one for the point at infinity .",
    "@xmath31 is the discriminant of the cubic @xmath32 . for an extremely clear introduction to elliptic curves in the context discussed here ,",
    "see the review paper by rubin and silverberg @xcite .",
    "a family of elliptic curves is formed by @xmath33 for integers @xmath34 that are fundamental discriminants .",
    "( a fundamental discriminant is an integer other than 1 that is not divisible by the square of any prime other than two and that satisfies @xmath35 or @xmath36 . ) the corresponding family of @xmath2-functions , ordered by @xmath37 , are @xmath38 where the characters @xmath39 are kronecker s extension of the legendre symbol , defined for prime @xmath25 as @xmath40 the family of curves @xmath41 is called the family of quadratic twists of @xmath21 because the characters @xmath42 are real , quadratic dirichlet characters .",
    "evidence ( see for example @xcite ) points to the zeros near the critical point ( where the critical line crosses the real axis ) of such a family of @xmath2-functions having statistics like the eigenvalues near 1 of matrices from @xmath4 with haar measure . to explain this correspondence more clearly",
    ", about half of the @xmath2-functions in this family are expected to have an even functional equation that relates @xmath43 to @xmath44 , meaning that the zeros on the critical line ( @xmath45 ) appear in complex conjugate pairs and if there is a zero at the critical point then it must be of even order , while the other half have an odd functional equation , forcing a zero of order 1,3,5 , ... at the critical point and all other zeros appearing in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "matrices in @xmath4 also have eigenvalues that appear in complex conjugate pairs , with the possible exception of unpaired zeros at 1 and -1 .",
    "the low - lying zeros of elliptic curve @xmath2-functions from the family above that have even functional equation show the statistics that eigenvalues of @xmath46 display near the point one .",
    "these eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs and an eigenvalue at one must have even multiplicity . in contrast , the low - lying zeros of the @xmath2-functions above that have an odd functional equation display the same statistics as @xmath18 eigenvalues near one , since in this case there is always an eigenvalue at one and it has to have odd multiplicity .",
    "( note that we could just as well have chosen @xmath47 matrices ( orthogonal with determinant -1 ) to model the @xmath2-functions with odd functional equation , since the statistics of these eigenvalues near to one are the same as those of @xmath18 , see for example @xcite . )",
    "both numerical and analytical evidence has been given already @xcite that random matrix theory can be used to conjecture the frequency of @xmath2-functions with even functional equation vanishing at the critical point in a family such as that described above .",
    "this is particularly important because of the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture which suggests that the order of the zero of an elliptic curve @xmath2-function at the critical point is the same as the rank of the elliptic curve itself .",
    "the rank is a non - negative integer @xmath48 that characterizes the number of rational points on the elliptic curve .",
    "the set of pairs @xmath49 that satisfy equation ( [ eq : elliptic ] ) , plus one point at infinity , form a commutative group ( with a standard law of addition defined on the curve ) that is isomorphic to @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is the subgroup of elements of finite order and @xmath48 is the rank of the curve .",
    "the frequency of various ranks in a family such as the one defined at ( [ eq : elliptic_d ] ) , or even whether the rank is bounded in such a family of elliptic curves , are important unanswered questions .    in @xcite the first step",
    "is taken towards using random matrix theory to generate conjectural answers to these questions by addressing the frequency of @xmath2-functions from elliptic curve families having any zero at all at the critical point . the argument used",
    "will be sketched below to illustrate the role played by random matrix theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform the random matrix calculations needed to predict the frequency of a zero of a _ given order _ at the critical point . applying the random matrix results from section [ sect : derivdist ] to the order of vanishing of @xmath2-functions involves the knowledge of complicated arithmetic quantities and much more work is needed in this area . some preliminary numerical investigation has been done @xcite for the case of third order vanishing .",
    "we now review the results in @xcite .",
    "we define the family of @xmath2-functions discussed above with even functional equation : @xmath52 the zeros of these @xmath2-functions near the critical point , @xmath53 , show the same statistics as the eigenvalues of matrices from @xmath46 , and so the @xmath2-values at the critical point are modelled by the characteristic polynomial @xmath54 evaluated at the point @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath57 .",
    "the moments of @xmath58 are easily calculated using weyl s expression @xcite for haar measure on the conjugacy classes of @xmath46 and a form of selberg s integral to be @xcite    @xmath59    the @xmath2-function moments are then conjectured to have the form @xcite    @xmath60    for large @xmath61 .",
    "here @xmath62 ( from equating the density of zeros near the critical point with the density of the matrix eigenvalues ) , the sum is over fundamental discriminants @xmath34 , @xmath63 is the number of terms in the sum and @xmath64 is an euler product that contains arithmetic information specific to the elliptic curve @xmath21 and the family of @xmath2-functions being averaged over . in practice",
    ", it is often a subset of @xmath65 that is summed over .",
    "if , for example , we select those @xmath2-functions @xmath43 in @xmath65 with @xmath66 and further restricted by a condition on @xmath67 , if @xmath68 is odd , and on @xmath69 , if @xmath68 is even , then the arithmetic factor would be    @xmath70    see @xcite and @xcite , section 4.4 , for more examples .",
    "next we consider the distribution of the values of the characteristic polynomials of @xmath46 matrices at the point 1 .",
    "if @xmath71 is the probability that the characteristic polynomial of a matrix chosen from @xmath46 with haar measure has a value between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , then @xmath74 for @xmath75 , since for small @xmath72 the behaviour is dominated by the pole of @xmath76 at @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 denotes a path of integration along the vertical line from @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "for large @xmath6 , @xmath81 ( @xmath82 is the barnes double gamma function , defined as @xcite : @xmath83/2 } \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\left [ ( 1+z / n)^n e^{-z+z^2/(2n)}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is euler s constant .",
    "see also ( [ eq : g ] ) for more properties of this function . ) since the probability that an element of @xmath46 has a characteristic polynomial whose value at 1 is @xmath14 or smaller is @xmath85 , we find that the the behaviour of this probability for small @xmath14 and large @xmath6 is @xmath86    we see from equation ( [ eq : elliptic_moment ] ) that for large @xmath34 , moments of @xmath2-functions are conjectured to be just @xmath64 ( the prime product ) times the random matrix moment @xmath76 .",
    "if this is true , then we define @xmath87 as the probability , amongst members of @xmath65 , that @xmath88 , for @xmath37 around @xmath89 , will take a value between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , giving    @xmath90    and an approximation for this probability for small @xmath72 should be    @xmath91    here equating densities of zeros means @xmath92 .",
    "so , roughly , random matrix theory predicts that the probability that an @xmath2-function @xmath93 , with @xmath37 close to @xmath94 , has a value at @xmath53 that is @xmath14 or smaller is @xmath95    but these @xmath2-functions are constrained to take only certain discretized values at the critical point @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath2-values have the form @xcite :    @xmath96    where the @xmath97 are integers , the fourier coefficients of a half - integral weight form .",
    "so , if @xmath98 then @xmath99 and the first thought would be to take @xmath100 in ( [ eq : discret ] ) and then to integrate @xmath94 from 0 to @xmath61 . however , there is arithmetical information encoded in the @xmath97 ( one is not always the smallest allowed non - zero value ) and so to avoid this problem , the conjecture stated in @xcite is restricted to prime discriminants .",
    "( conrey , keating , rubinstein , snaith ) : [ conj:1 ]    let @xmath21 be an elliptic curve defined over @xmath101 .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath102 such that    @xmath103    ( the conjecture was originally stated in @xcite with @xmath104 , but in fact numerics have revealed that the constant can be zero @xcite for certain families .",
    "an explanation of such a case with @xmath105 was given by delaunay @xcite . )    with the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture , this suggests that out of all the elliptic curves associated with @xmath2-functions in @xmath65 with prime discriminant @xmath106 ( there are of order @xmath107 of them ) , a number of order @xmath108 of them should have rank two or greater .",
    "the @xmath109 has been predicted previously by sarnak using different arguments , but random matrix theory adds more detailed information in the form of the power on the logarithm . for numerical evidence supporting the conjecture , see @xcite and @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will calculate the distribution of values equivalent to ( [ eq : dist ] ) that is required to probe questions of elliptic curves of a given rank occurring in families of quadratic twists ( equation ( [ eq : elliptic_d ] ) ) .",
    "in this section we will calculate the probability of the @xmath1th derivative of a characteristic polynomial ( [ eq : cp ] ) of a random @xmath0 matrix taking a value less then @xmath14 at @xmath55 when all lower derivatives are constrained to be zero at this point .",
    "that is , we perform the random matrix average over the ( measure zero ) subset of @xmath0 of matrices with @xmath1 eigenvalues at the point 1 on the unit circle , and @xmath110 other eigenvalues occurring in complex conjugate pairs ( @xmath11 )",

    "<S> the value distribution of derivatives of characteristic polynomials of matrices from @xmath0 is calculated at the point 1 , the symmetry point on the unit circle of the eigenvalues of these matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we consider subsets of matrices from @xmath0 that are constrained to have @xmath1 eigenvalues equal to 1 , and investigate the first non - zero derivative of the characteristic polynomial at that point . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the values of random matrix characteristic polynomials and values of @xmath2-functions in families has been well - established . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation for this work is the expectation that through this connection with @xmath2-functions derived from families of elliptic curves , and using the birch and swinnerton - dyer conjecture to relate values of the @xmath2-functions to the rank of elliptic curves , random matrix theory will be useful in probing important questions concerning these ranks . </S>"
