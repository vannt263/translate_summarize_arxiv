    "an efficient method of generating second - harmonic radiation ( shg ) can find use in a variety of technical applications .",
    "confined geometry - such as in fibers or film - waveguides - allows concentration of the fundamental radiation at the position of the material with nonlinear susceptibility . in earlier work",
    "@xcite we have investigated shg in a planar geometry , and studied the dependence on the position of nonlinear material with respect to the planar device that guides the fundamental radiation .",
    "shg was enhanced by a judicious use of periodicity of the nonlinear material in the direction of propagation of the fundamental wave . in this paper",
    "we consider instead confinement of radiation in a circular waveguide or optical fiber .",
    "this geometry has the advantage of confinement in both transverse dimensions , thus avoiding diffraction and the corresponding dispersion of the fundamental beam in a transverse direction .",
    "the following calculations show that the circular geometry is preferable to the planar one , even when in the latter case the beam has infinite width , so that diffraction no longer plays a role .    in the following we analyze shg in a circular waveguide for an idealized situation of high symmetry .",
    "the nonlinear material - representing an idealized polarization sheet @xcite- is assumed to be arranged in a periodic array of cylindrical tubelets centered around the axis of the waveguide .",
    "the period in the axial direction can be optimized by use of a bragg condition involving the wavenumbers of both the fundamental and the doubled frequency .",
    "in addition one can optimize the axial width of the tubelets and their transverse radius . by integration over the radius",
    "the calculation can be extended to cover the case of tubelets of finite thickness , or of an array of solid cylindrical pieces .",
    "admittedly , the idealized situation under consideration may be difficult to realize experimentally .",
    "the intention of our model calculation is to elucidate the principles , and to serve as a guide for the analysis of more realistic but less symmetric situations . due to the high symmetry of the model situation we can limit attention to a small number of modes .",
    "this advantage is lost in more realistic situations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we perform a calculation in analogy to that for planar geometry @xcite for a finite length @xmath0 of nonlinear material distributed in @xmath1 tubelets , where @xmath1 is much larger than unity . for optimum phase matching",
    "the intensity of the generated shg grows in proportion to @xmath2 . in the circular waveguide",
    "the efficiency is sufficiently high so that it is necessary to consider depletion of the fundamental . on a large length scale the effect of depletion",
    "may be studied by use of mode - coupling theory .",
    "the situation is mathematically analogous to that of shg in anisotropic crystals , so that the mode - coupling theory of armstrong et al .",
    "@xcite can be used .",
