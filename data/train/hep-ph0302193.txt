    "strong interactions between quarks can be well described by qcd in the standard model .",
    "recently important progresses in the theoretical description of hadrons containing a heavy quark have been achieved with the development of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite .",
    "based on the spin - flavor symmetry of qcd , exactly valid in the infinite heavy quark mass limit , @xmath5 , this framework provides a systematic expansion of heavy hadron spectra and both the strong and weak transition amplitudes in terms of the leading contribution , plus corrections decreasing as powers of @xmath6 .",
    "hqet has been applied successfully to learn about the properties of meson and baryon made of both heavy and light quarks .",
    "due to the asymptotic freedom of qcd , non - perturbative effect plays an important role in the hadronic physics .",
    "thus it is inevitable to employ some non - perturbative technique in strong interaction related problems .",
    "qcd sum rule @xcite formulated in the framework of hqet @xcite is a desirable approach and proves to be predictive @xcite .",
    "this method allows one to relate hadronic observable to qcd parameter _ via _ the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the correlator .",
    "the choice of the interpolating current for a state with given spin and parity is the first step in the application of qcd sum rule method .",
    "principally , if a current is chosen within the framework of hqet , qcd sum rule can be applied to many fields without ambiguity and successfully .",
    "but the real situation is not so simple .",
    "the main problem lies just on the choice of the interpolating currents . on the heavy meson side ,",
    "the current interpolating a given spin and parity ground state is unique for it constitutes of one heavy and one light quark .",
    "however , on the heavy baryon side , the interpolating current is not unique@xcite . for a given state there exist two commonly adopted interpolating currents .",
    "both bear the general form as @xcite @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the charge conjugation matrix , @xmath9 is the flavor matrix which is antisymmetric for @xmath10 baryon and symmetric for @xmath11 baryon , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are some gamma matrices , and a , b , c denote the color indices .",
    "one kind of current s @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be chosen covariantly as @xmath14 for @xmath10 baryon , @xmath15 for @xmath16 baryon , and @xmath17 for @xmath18 baryon .",
    "another kind of current can be obtained by inserting a factor @xmath19 behind the @xmath12 matrices defined by equations ( [ lq])-([sqs ] ) .",
    "we denote them as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . in qcd sum rule applications",
    "those two currents are usually used separately@xcite .",
    "constituent quark type current which is the linear combination of the two previously defined currents with the same coefficient can also be found in application@xcite . but generally speaking , the interpolating current should be the linear combination of the two currents with arbitrary coefficients . and also there have been many papers treating just the question of the choice of baryon currents both in full qcd and in hqet sum rules@xcite . in this paper we adopt the general form @xmath22 , in which the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be arbitrary real numbers , to investigate the effects of different choice of baryon currents on physical observable .",
    "the baryon coupling constants in hqet are defined through the vacuum - to - baryon matrix element of the interpolating current as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spinor and @xmath27 is the rarita - schwinger spinor in the hqet , respectively .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are equivalent since @xmath16 and @xmath30 belong to the doublet with the same spin - parity of the light degrees of freedom .",

    "the qcd sum rule determination of baryon coupling constants can be achieved by analyzing the two - point correlator .",
    "these diagonal correlators of the single interpolating currents have been obtained long ago by many authors and are of the same form for both the interpolating currents @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "non - diagonal correlators have been analyzed in ref.@xcite in the leading order in @xmath36 and in next to leading order in @xmath36 in ref.@xcite . in our previous works@xcite",
    "we adopted the diagonal correlator as the starting point since for the non - diagonal correlator there is no perturbative contribution under the usual assumption of quark - hadron duality , let alone to be the dominant part to the sum rules derived . here",
    "we only have one unique interpolating current and there is only one diagonal correlator and no non - diagonal case to be analyzed .",
    "our theoretical result thus is the combination of the previously called diagonal and non - diagonal results .",
    "it should be noted that the non - diagonal one is merely treated as power corrections of ope in our choice of current .    in our calculations condensates with a dimension higher than @xmath37",

    "the other contribution to the correlator comes from higher resonant states . for the little knowledge of this part of contribution it is common to resort to the quark - hadron duality , which insures that continuum contribution can be approximated by the integral of the perturbative spectral density over a continuum threshold , to get a predictive result .    on theoretical side",

    "the effective mass can be expressed through the derivative of borel variable t in the coupling constant sum rules as @xmath84 in which k(t ) denotes the right hand side of eq.([2psumrule ] ) .",

    "but the second step , which is the analysis of coupling constant sum rules , will be omitted here as the focus of our interest is on the mass sum rules entirely .",
    "our main idea in the consideration of the effect of the current mixing parameter to the sum rules is to see if there exists a reasonable stability window of the borel parameter @xmath43 under the variation of @xmath79 in the range from @xmath85 to @xmath86 . for the analysis of the coupling constant and mass sum rules",

    "so there is no or at most little space left for the mixing of currents and what we obtained is the diagonal sum rule .",
    "it is reasonable to assume this result does indicate that there exists some mechanism which forbids the mixing of the two sector interpolating currents in the mass sum rule in the leading order . the diagonal sum rule result can be checked with previous work : when @xmath70 lies between @xmath93 there exists the stability window @xmath94 .",
    "the effective mass thus obtained is @xmath95 , in which the error only reflects the variation of borel parameter @xmath43 and continuum threshold @xmath70 .    for the @xmath1-type baryon all sum rule windows are narrower than that of @xmath0-type baryon and",
    "the stability is not as good as that of @xmath0-type baryon , either@xcite . with the increasing of @xmath79",

    "<S> in this paper we investigate the effects due to the mixing of two interpolating currents for ground state baryons within the framework of heavy quark effective theory using the qcd sum rule approach . </S>",
    "<S> both two - point and three - point sum rules , thus the mass , coupling constant and isgur - wise function sum rules are considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to contrast those results with each other . </S>",
    "<S> based on the isgur - wise functions obtained in this paper , we also analyze the effects of current mixing to @xmath0- type and and @xmath1-type semi - leptonic decays @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> decay widths corresponding to various mixing parameters are obtained and can be compared to the experimental data . </S>"
