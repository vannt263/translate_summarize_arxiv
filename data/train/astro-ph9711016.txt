    "indications that seyfert galaxies may contain a significant starburst component come from several different directions , although it is not yet clear how such star formation might affect the properties of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",

    "( 1997 ) showed that most seyfert galaxies , unlike radio quasars , roughly follow the radio - far - infrared correlation , which suggests that their bolometric luminosity is dominated by star formation activity .",
    "extended minor - axis radio emission from seyferts ( baum et al .",
    "1993 ) suggests that many seyfert galaxies may contain powerful circumnuclear starbursts .",
    "the inner few hundred parsecs of mrk 477 have recently been shown to contain an extremely luminous and compact starburst ( heckman et al .",

    "a blueshifted ridge of emission between the ring and the nucleus is interpreted as infalling gas that may provide fuel for the agn .",
    "the star - formation in ngc 1068 and ngc 7469 may result from a stellar bar which is both triggering extended star - formation and funneling material inwards to the agn .",
    "previous investigations have shown that half of the total luminosity of ngc 1068 ( telesco et al .",
    "1984 ; lester et al . 1987 ) and mrk 477 ( heckman et al . 1997 ) , and nearly two - thirds of that of ngc 7469 ( genzel et al . 1995 ) , arises from starburst activity .",
    "this study is aimed at looking for possible correlations between arcsec radio structure and optical  ir emission - line properties in a sample of southern radio - luminous seyfert galaxies ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the mapping of arcsec radio structure in southern seyfert galaxies has only become feasible recently with the advent of the australia telescope national facility and many of these radio sources have not yet been mapped .",
    "our pilot study focuses on one aspect of the properties of agns , namely the possible relationship between agn or starburst activity and the morphology of the arcsec - scale radio emission .",
    "for example , we wish to investigate the possibility that radio - emitting plasma ejected from an agn might interact and trigger star formation in the inner regions of galaxies .",
    "alternatively , in other systems , the radio emission itself may originate in circumnuclear star formation and this will be investigated via spectroscopic observation .    in this paper",
    "we present the radio images , at three wavelengths , of the galaxies in our sample , as well as optical and nir spectra for an interesting subset .",
    "in addition we will compare the thermal properties of the dust emission ( as measured by global fir properties of the galaxies , e.g. heisler & vader 1994 ; condon et al .",
    "1991 ) with the radio properties .",

    "total fluxes for the sources were calculated by blanking all data below twice the rms noise in the image in a region close to the source . because these observations are optimized for studying the nuclear region , they are relatively insensitive to extended emission .",
    "thus our images are primarily of the nuclear region and will therefore not show any smooth extended structure on scales of tens of arcsec , and consequently the total radio fluxes quoted may be an underestimate .",

    "50% of the galaxies observed at 13 cm show extended emission , and @xmath17 33% show extended emission at both 6 and 3 cm .",
    "we find a wide variation in radio spectral indices .",
    "free - free absorption is likely to be important in the cores of two systems : ngc  4507 and ngc  7213 , and in the outer radio components of ir  11249 - 2859 ( see @xmath24.2 ) .",
    "there is also a wide variation in the radio morphologies of the galaxies , which fall into four main classes ( e.g. wilson 1988 ) .",
    "the physical significance of these classes is supported by the fact that different optical emission line ratios are associated with the different morphological radio types and that there appears to be some correlation with iras color ratios ( see @xmath24.3 ) :    \\1 . *",
    "d  class * diffuse radio morphology which is characterized by a low surface brightness component surrounding a compact core .",
    "the low surface brightness emission is generally extended on scales @xmath12 5@xmath13 .",
    "d - class sources have been linked with starburst activity in that the brightness temperature and spectral index of the radio emission are consistent with a combination of supernova remnants , diffuse synchrotron emission from supernova - accelerated cosmic - ray electrons , and h ii regions ( e.g. ulvestad 1982 ; condon et al .",
    "1982 ) .",
    "* l  class * linear structure which straddles a compact core believed to be powered primarily by an outflow from an agn .",
    "the outflow may , however , also arise from a circumnuclear starburst ( e.g. baum et al .",
    "we define the radio emission as  linear  if the axial ratio of the linear structure is @xmath12 3 .",
    "l - class radio sources often have optical emission line ratios consistent with high ionization , high - velocity gas associated with the narrow - line region ( nlr ) ( haniff , wilson , & ward 1988 ; wilson , ward , & haniff 1988 ; whittle et al .",
    "1988 ) , and as such are intimately connected with an agn .",
    "whittle et al .",
    "( 1988 ) studied the velocity structure of the [ oiii]@xmath15007 emission line in a sample of l - class sources , and found that in some cases there was evidence for an outflow of ionized gas , suggesting that the radio emission of some l - class sources may be due to an outflow of plasma from an agn .",
    "\\3 . * c  class * compact sources , which are either unresolved or only marginally resolved on the arcsec scale by our present observations ( see table 2 ) .    the d and l classifications have to be used with care , as they refer to the dominant source of radio flux which can cover a wide range of scales ( arc seconds to arc minutes ) .",
    "for example , a faint l - class source may be contained in d - class emission , as in ngc 1068 , where a collimated structure is seen inside a starburst disk ( e.g. wilson & ulvestad 1982b ; wynn - williams , becklin , & scoville 1985 ) .",
    "other ambiguities may also arise .",
    "a d - class source seen edge - on might appear as an l - class source .",
    "a linear radio structure could be the result of an outflow from an agn or circumnuclear starburst , but could also be emission from a bar or an edge - on spiral arm .",
    "these ambiguities can sometimes be avoided by comparing the optical and radio emission .",
    "for example , radio emission from a spiral arm or a bar will be coincident with the optical structure .    as shown in table 3 ,",
    "our sample contains two d - class , four l - class , one is a hybrid l+d - class ( see below ) , and five c - class sources .",
    "ic 3639 and ngc 5135 , the only d - class sources in our sample , are nearly face - on galaxies and their d classification was straightforward and not hampered by any orientation effects .",
    "on the other hand , care must be taken in the interpretation of the l - class objects in the sample . in one case , ngc 7130",
    ", the elongated radio structure may be due to the existence of an asymmetric stellar bar in the galaxy .",
    "this source is known to contain vigorous circumnuclear star - formation ( shields & filippenko 1990 - see @xmath25.2 ) , and the long - dimension of its @xmath113 cm radio structure is oriented along a position angle ( pa ) 0@xmath8 which is close to that of an inner bar .",
    "we therefore attribute the radio emission in this galaxy to either shocks or star formation within the bar .",
    "however , radio emission from the other l - class galaxies probably represents an outflow from the nucleus .",
    "the pa of the linear structure seen in ngc 3393 at 13 cm is 23@xmath8 and is not coincident with spiral arms or a bar . the asymmetric double radio source seen at 3 cm",
    "is also seen in recent vla 6 cm observations at higher spatial resolution ( r. morganti , private communication ) .",
    "ngc 4507 , while not highly collimated , meets our criterion for an l - class , although the knots seen at 6 cm to the north and the south could be due to a  hot spot  ring , extra - nuclear h ii regions , or sn near the nucleus , and not a nuclear outflow . as we discuss in @xmath24.2 , the radio spectral index of the nucleus of ngc 4507",
    "is flat , suggesting that there is significant free - free absorption .",
    "the position angle of the linear structure seen at 13 cm and 6 cm in iras 11249 - 2859 is 125@xmath8 and is at an angle of 25@xmath8 with the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the emission is from h ii regions at the end of an edge on spiral arm or from a bar .",
    "there are four main effects which are likely to influence the radio spectral index of seyfert and starburst galaxies :    \\1 .",
    "the synchrotron emission from the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "the cosmic rays are generated and re - accelerated by supernovae and supernova remnants , but have a lifetime which extends their range beyond the supernova remnants themselves .",
    "this synchrotron radiation is expected to have a spectral index of @xmath17 -0.7 .",
    "the emission generally dominates the radio power of starburst galaxies , and is presumably responsible for the tight fir / radio correlation obeyed by these galaxies ;    \\2 . the synchrotron emission from relativistic particles generated by the agn .",
    "this radiation could , in principle , cover a wide range of spectral indices .",
    "for example , the cores of radio - loud radio galaxies and quasars typically have a flat - spectrum core ( because of synchrotron self - absorption ) but steep - spectrum extended radio - lobes ( because of the cooling of high - energy electrons ) .",
    "however , most seyfert galaxies have agn core spectral indices in the region of -0.7 .",
    "condon et al .",
    "( 1991 ) argue that , amongst infrared - luminous galaxies , even those that are flat - spectrum do not have a sufficiently high brightness temperature for synchrotron self - absorption to be important ;    \\3 .",
    "thermal emission from h ii regions .",
    "compact h ii regions in our galaxy generate free - free emission from hot electrons .",
    "most are optically thin , giving a flat spectrum , but most compact h ii regions are optically thick at centimeter wavelengths , giving a spectral index @xmath172 . however , condon et al .",
    "have demonstrated that , at centimeter wavelengths , the integrated flux of such regions is generally small compared to the synchrotron emission , so that star - formation regions in starburst and seyfert galaxies have a typical synchrotron spectrum ;    \\4 .",
    "the radio emission from ultra - luminous infrared galaxies is optically thick to free - free absorption , so that the typical synchrotron spectrum of these galaxies is flattened at low frequencies ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "the combined result of these effects in seyfert and starburst galaxies is to produce a typical radio spectral index of -0.7 with a flattening at low frequencies in some starburst sources because of free - free absorption . in our sample of galaxies , excluding ngc 4507 and ngc 7213 , the spectral indices of the cores lie in the range -0.57 to -1.05 , which is consistent with a dominant non - thermal synchrotron process , although the cosmic - ray electrons may be associated either with star formation , or else with an agn core .",
    "ngc 4507 and ngc 7213 differ from the other seyferts in our sample , having low spectral indices ( @xmath14(3,6 ) = -0.34 and -0.25 , respectively ) .",
    "other seyfert galaxies are known to contain flat - spectrum radio sources ( ulvestad & wilson 1989 ) .",
    "these authors suggested that the flat spectral indices they derived for some of their galaxies could arise from synchrotron self - absorption or free - free absorption from the ionized gas .",
    "given that ngc 7213 is a seyfert 1 galaxy , it is relevant that antonucci & barvainis ( 1988 ) reported that 8 out of 17 rqqs and seyfert 1 galaxies imaged at 20 , 6 and 2 cm had flat spectral indices , arising from a flat or rising component which becomes dominant by 2 cm .",
    "this 2 cm  excess  could be due to free - free emission either from a starburst ( requiring a brightness temperature @xmath2210@xmath23 k ) or from @xmath1710@xmath24 k nuclear free - free emission ( antonucci & barvainis 1988 ) .",
    "the core of ngc 7213 is marginally resolved by our 1@xmath13 beam at 3 cm .",
    "assuming a core size equal to our synthesized beam , the brightness temperature of the core in this source is about 3000 k , which is too low for synchrotron self - absorption , suggesting that free - free absorption is responsible for the low spectral index , although free - free emission is also plausible .",
    "the free - free absorption may arise from a vigorous starburst present in the nuclear region of this galaxy , or , perhaps , from a high column density narrow - line region .",
    "interestingly , ngc 7213 contains a ring of h ii regions 20 - 40@xmath13 away from the nucleus ( evans et al .",
    "1996 ) , which , at the distance of this galaxy ( see table 1 ) , corresponds to a ring 2 - 3 kpc in radius . yet",
    ", our radio observations reveal that in the inner 1@xmath13 ( or inner 100 pc ) star - formation is an important contribution to the radio emission .",
    "radio observations of much higher resolution and dynamic range are important for this source in order to understand the morphology of the radio emission .",
    "unfortunately , the core of ngc 4507 is unresolved at 3 cm so we can not calculate the brightness temperature of the emission for that source , and as a consequence we can not rule out synchrotron self - absorption as the cause for the flat spectral index .",
    "we have obtained radio spectral indices of the knots in the linear structure imaged at 13 and 6 cm , in iras 11249 - 2859 . the spectral index , @xmath14(13,6 ) , of the first knot to the south - east ( see fig .",
    "2a , b ) is -0.88 , consistent with synchrotron emission , whereas the first two knots to the north - west are -0.23 and -0.34 , respectively , which is consistent with free - free absorption .",
    "the fir / radio correlation is thought to arise from a common dependence of the fir and radio emission on the formation of massive stars ( e.g. lisenfeld , volk , & xu 1996 ) , and it is generally believed to hold up to high fir and radio luminosities .",
    "galaxies , or regions within a galaxy , that adhere to the fir / radio correlation are likely to be regions of massive star - formation .",
    "our sample contains a mix of galaxies that fell on , or were radio - bright with respect to , the fir correlation , as illustrated by figure 1 , which is based on our 13 cm flux densities ( see table 3 ) and published iras fluxes ( see table 5 ) .",
    "a comparison between the fir flux and the radio flux is a useful indicator of the dominant fir and radio emission mechanisms .",
    "for example , helou et al . ( 1985 ) define a parameter q , which is defined as :    q @xmath25 log[(fir/3.75 x 10@xmath26 hz)/s@xmath27(1 )    where fir @xmath25 1.26 x 10@xmath28(2.58s@xmath29+s@xmath30).(2 )    it has been shown that q is an indicator of the relative importance of starburst to agn - dominated activity in the nuclear heating of dust in galaxies . for example",
    ", the mean value of q for the iras bright galaxy sample starbursts is 2.34 ( @xmath31 @xmath17 0.19 ) and for agns q @xmath7 2 ( see condon et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "we present in table 5 the q - values for our sample , based on iras fir fluxes and on our 13 cm ( 2.437 ghz ) radio flux densities .",
    "we use q @xmath25",
    "log[(fir/3.75 x 10@xmath26 hz)/s@xmath3 ] , similar to that of helou et al .",

    "1992 ) and the corresponding fir spectral indices ( @xmath14 @xmath25 d log s / d log @xmath33 ) .",
    "dust heated primarily by a luminous buried agn is found in some galaxies , ( i.e. , the so called `` warmer '' galaxies ) and vader et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested that such sources emit strongly near 60 @xmath11 m , whereas the uv emission from a pure starburst population is believed to be re - radiated mostly between 60 and 100 @xmath11 m .",
    "in particular , galaxies with star - formation tend to have steeper far - infrared spectral indices ( @xmath14(25,60 ) @xmath22 - 1.4 and @xmath14(60,100 ) @xmath7 -1.1 ) , and those systems dominated by an agn have a relatively flat fir spectrum .    of the 5  compact  ( c )",
    "radio sources in our sample , 4 ( iras 11215 - 2806 , iras 13059 - 2407 , iras 18325 - 5926 , & ngc 7213 ) have fir flux ratios and q - values that support agn - dominated fir and radio emission .",
    "these systems probably have very little nuclear / circumnuclear star - formation .",
    "the one exception to this is ic 4995 .",
    "this galaxy shows unresolved structure in the 3 and 6 cm radio maps and yet has a q - value suggestive of a star formation  dominated galaxy .",
    "spectra , which will be presented in paper ii , show little evidence for significant powerful large  scale star formation in this galaxy which argues against the fir flux coming from star formation in the outer disk .",
    "furthermore , the point - like nature of the k - band image of this galaxy ( not shown ) also argues against disk - wide star formation contributing to the large fir flux .",
    "we therefore conclude that circumstantial evidence points to ic 4995 containing a very compact starburst region which is unresolved by our present observations . alternatively ,",
    "ic 4995 may turn out to be the exception to the rule discovered by helou et al .",

    "this combination of iras flux ratios has recently been found to be well correlated in samples of seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. heisler , lumsden , & bailey 1997 ) and is being modeled by dopita et al .",
    "it appears that our galaxies also show a tight correlation in these colors . a lower limit for the s(100)/s(12 ) flux ratio is shown for ngc 3393 , iras 13059 - 2407 , and ic 4995 . for iras",
    "11215 - 2806 , only the s(60 ) and s(25 ) band fluxes are known .",
    "reasonable limits on the s(100)/s(12 ) flux ratio would imply that it too follows the correlation ( see vertical line in fig .",
    "3 ) .    figure 3 shows a number of interesting properties for the sample .",
    "if the radio morphologies of the galaxies are taken into consideration it is clear that the c - class galaxies occupy the lower - left ( warmer fir colors ) part of the diagram , whereas the d - class sources ( and the one partially resolved c - class source ) lie at the cooler end of the correlation .",
    "the l - class sources span the entire range , although the two most highly collimated sources , ic 5063 and iras 11249 - 2859 lie in the warmer region of the diagram .",
    "this morphological segregation , based on iras colors , suggests that the global fir properties are linked in some way to the radio morphologies .    to understand how this might be",
    ", we will consider what has been learned recently about galaxies with small ( i.e. warm ) s(60)/s(25 ) iras flux ratios .",
    "heisler et al . (",
    "1997 ) have shown that seyfert 2 galaxies with warmer s(60)/s(25 ) colors are most likely to show broad permitted lines in their polarized nuclear light ( hidden broad - line regions - hblrs ) , and lower line - of - sight extinction to the nucleus . within the context of the unified theory of seyfert galaxies , heisler et al .",
    "provide evidence that the warmer colors are a result of the viewing orientation of the inner dust torus which is postulated to surround the agn . a dust torus seen closer to face - on would show warmer iras colors than those seen more nearly edge - on because the viewer sees more deeply into the inner regions as a result of a higher viewing inclination .",
    "can the same argument be applied to our sample ?",
    "ic 5063 ( l+d ) shows the warmest colors in fig . 3 and",
    "is already know to be a hblr galaxy , and so its warm colors are consistent with the heisler et al . picture .",
    "a more challenging problem is to explain why the c - class sources should have warmer iras colors .",
    "one possibility might be that the compact sources are collimated `` jet - like '' sources seen end - on .",
    "if the jets were emitted roughly orthogonally to the dust torus , then this would provide a natural explanation for the warmer colors since the viewing direction would be favorable for seeing deeper into the dust torus . in at least one of the c - class sources ( ir 1832 - 59 )",
    "the galaxy exhibits high excitation optical emission lines ( isasawa et al .",
    "1995 ) and is suspected , from x - ray evidence , to contain a seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "this would seem to support the view that we can almost view directly the seyfert 1 core .    certainly the two galaxies with the coolest colors , ngc 5135 and ngc 7130 show evidence for large - scale extended star formation and their fir colors are likely to be dominated by heat sources spread over a large scale .",
    "however , we caution that our understanding of correlations like that in figure 3 is still in its infancy , and any possible correlation between warm iras colors and radio morphology may be entirely coincidental .",
    "work such as modeling by dopita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) may help to clarify the nature of such a correlation in terms of optical depth effects in the dusty torus at 12 @xmath11 m .",

    ". we will argue below that this may be a result of enhanced [ oi ] and [ sii ] emission caused by weak ( 150 km s@xmath6 ) shocks in the circumnuclear environment ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .    a marked east / west asymmetry exists in both the emission lines and the radio distribution ( e.g. in fig .",
    "5a , c , note how the line ratios show this east / west asymmetry ) .",
    "we will discuss this in relation to a simple model of the galaxy below .",
    "along pa 0@xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "6a , c ) the line ratios change smoothly from agn to h ii - region - like emission with increasing distance from the nucleus .",
    "again we note that the [ oi ] emission - line ratios dip significantly into the liner region .",
    "unlike the spectrum taken at pa 90@xmath8 , there is no noticeable asymmetry on either side of the nucleus .",
    "we also obtained a spectrum 7@xmath165 n of the nucleus along pa 90@xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "7a , c for bpt and vo diagrams ) .",
    "the [ oi ] distribution is remarkably asymmetric , showing strong liner - type emission in the east , but h ii - region - like emission in the west .",
    "this mimics the behavior at pa 90@xmath8 through the nucleus , except that no agn emission is seen .",
    "the radio emission is highly extended and asymmetric at 13 cm , being stronger and more extensive to the north - west ( see fig .",
    "the two spectra which probed the east - west character of the galaxy also reflect an asymmetry .",
    "strong optical emission on the western side of the nucleus , in the region of the high surface - brightness radio emission , shows h ii - region - like spectra , whereas to the east the emission is more characteristic of liner emission , and this occurs on the edge of the rapidly declining radio emission .",
    "this behavior is seen in both east - west spectra which cut through the agn and to the north of the agn .",
    "we note that liner characteristics ( especially enhanced line ratios of [ oi ]  @xmath16300 and [ sii ]  @xmath356716,6731 to h@xmath14 ) could arise from either a low - powered agn illuminating ambient narrow - line region gas or from high - velocity shocks ( see dopita & sutherland , 1995 for discussion ) .",
    "the fact that the spectra appear h ii - region - like over the area of the extended radio emission region but liner - like at the edges of the radio structure , suggest to us that the liner emission may be from shocked gas resulting from a tipped outflow from a widespread starburst in the central few kpc .",
    "the morphology of the radio emission itself is reminiscent of outflows such as those seen in starburst systems like m82 .",
    "unfortunately , because the radio surface brightness of the very extended 13 cm emission is low , it is not possible to determine a spectral index of the plasma , but the radio emission may be from relativistic electrons which have burst out of the disk asymmetrically , perhaps from supernova explosions . in this simple picture , gas from the outflow interacts with ambient ism material to shock and produce a liner spectrum . if the liner spectrum were interpreted as coming predominantly from shock waves , they would imply supersonic flow velocities of the order of 150 - 200 km s@xmath6 for ic 3639 ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .",
    "one can test this model further by obtaining higher dispersion spectra to look for mass - motions in the gas in order to identify conclusively a superwind in this galaxy .",
    "an indication that nuclear star - formation may have been episodic in ic 3639 comes from the marginal detection of balmer absorption ( h@xmath34 ) in a ring at about 7@xmath13 from the nucleus .",
    "three 1-d spectra , at that angular distance from the nucleus , hint at balmer absorption .",
    "however , it is not seen in any of the other extracted 1-d spectra .",
    "if these features are confirmed ( e.g. by deeper spectra in the blue ) this might suggest evidence for a post - starburst population some 1 - 3 gyr old .",
    "the h@xmath34 emission line , with faint absorption superimposed , was not corrected for absorption and we caution that the a@xmath36 derived from the balmer decrement may be unreliable . as a consequence the line flux ratios , in these three spectra , could be in error by @xmath17 30% .",
    "we show this feature in figure 3b .",
    "ngc 5135 is a barred spiral .",
    "the 13 cm radio image ( see fig .",
    "2a ) shows considerable extended structure .",
    "our observations show that , in addition to the central extended emission regions , there are knots of emission on a larger scale .",
    "in particular , there are two relatively bright knots of emission , one at a position angle of 10@xmath8 , 18@xmath164 ( 4.7 kpc ) distant from the central source , and another at 279@xmath8 , 13@xmath168 ( 3.5 kpc ) away from the center of emission .",
    "comparison with the optical image shows that the strongest emission is located at the center of the bright optical bar ( see fig .",
    "ulvestad & wilson ( 1989 ) obtained 6 and 20 cm images of ngc 5135 , providing arcsec resolution with the a and b arrays of the vla . at both wavelengths they saw an asymmetric structure consisting of a bright core with amorphous , fainter extension to the north - east ( d - class source ) .",
    "the extension broke up into several smaller knots giving it a bubble - like appearance .",
    "all of this structure lies within the inner contours of our 13 cm map .",
    "we obtained optical spectra at the aat for this galaxy along pa 19@xmath8 and 45@xmath8 .",
    "the former intersects the radio knot to the north - east and the latter follows the diffuse radio emission detected by ulvestad & wilson . along both position angles , the emission is extended over @xmath175@xmath13 .",

    "although not very extended , the optical emission is consistent with star - formation in the circumnuclear region .",

    "the extracted 1-d spectrum for the nucleus of ngc 3393 is presented in figure 10a .",
    "a spectrum was obtained for iras 11249 - 2859 along a position angle of 90@xmath8 through the nucleus , cutting through the radio knot to the east .",

    "it is interesting to note that the h@xmath14 is extended over @xmath176@xmath13 , or 2.7 kpc , and [ oi ]  @xmath16300 is extended over @xmath172@xmath13 , or @xmath171.4 kpc .",
    "proceeding east , away from the nucleus , the [ oi ] emission at first declines and then increases in strength @xmath174@xmath13 from the center and then disappears again at larger distances .",
    "this increase in flux at 4@xmath13 corresponds to the position of the south - east radio knot .",
    "a similar increase in line emission at the position of the knot is seen in the ( blended ) h@xmath14 & [ nii ]  @xmath356548,6584 emission and the [ sii ]  @xmath356731,6716 lines .",
    "the ratio of [ sii ] to h@xmath14 is 0.39 , [ nii ]  @xmath16584 to h@xmath14 is 0.48 , and [ oi]/h@xmath14 is 0.04 . off the nucleus , h@xmath34 and [ oiii ]  @xmath15007",

    "we note that these ratios are also consistent with a low to intermediate velocity shock - wave process ( dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .",
    "given that the optical emission lines are coincident with one of the components of the linear triple radio source ( the se knot ) , it is clear that follow - up observations of higher sensitivity along a pa of 125@xmath8 are highly desirable .",
    "we speculate that these observations might reveal that the nuclear outflow is causing wide scale shocks in the disk of this galaxy giving rise to the enhanced [ oi ] and possibly inducing secondary star - formation , consistent with the flat radio spectral indices of the knots to the nw .",
    "all four galaxies observed spectroscopically in the nir ( iras 18325 - 5926 , ic 4995 , ic 5063 , and ngc 7213 ; see table 4 ) show detectable emission lines of br@xmath18 , h@xmath37 , and [ feii ] .",
    "the nuclear spectra are presented in figure 11 .    unlike the other galaxies",
    "observed at nir wavelengths , iras 18325 - 5926 shows no evidence for an underlying stellar continuum ( in particular the co ( 2 - 0 ) band - head is missing ) .",
    "this is consistent with significant obscuration , even at infrared wavelengths , by dust near the nucleus .",
    "unusually high levels of obscuration in this probable heavily embedded seyfert 1 nucleus was also inferred from the optical and x - ray observations of isasawa et al .",
    "we note that the lack of the co band - head could be due to a stronger continuum from the seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "ngc 7130 may be an example of a collisional ring galaxy ( e.g. see the review by appleton & struck - marcell 1996 ) formed as a result of a small companion passing through the disk of a larger system . in the radio , at 13 cm , this galaxy is clearly extended with a linear north - south structure ( l - class source ) .",
    "however , the origin of the linear structure is unclear since it is coincident with a bar along the same pa .",
    "this galaxy has been studied in detail by shields & filippenko ( 1990 ) , who spectrally mapped the nuclear regions of the galaxy .",
    "their work clearly shows the composite nature of this galaxy , in that the line intensity ratios vary radially from those indicative of agns , close to the nucleus , to that of h ii regions at increasing distances from the center .",
    "we obtained a k - band continuum infrared image of ngc 7130 ( fig .",

    "morganti , oosterloo , & tsvetanov ( 1997 ) have also imaged this galaxy at 3 cm and our maps agree very well in morphology and flux . at 6 cm , the remnants of the linear structure can be seen , but a faint shell of emission is seen extending from the end of the linear structure , perhaps indicative of a bow - shock .",
    "the diffuse emission observed at 6 cm may result from the interaction of the linear structure , i.e.  plasmons  ejected from the agn , with the ambient ism in the inner disk .",
    "this galaxy is a hybrid l+d - class ( see figure 2b ) , since it is an l - class source at 3 cm and a d - class source at 6 cm . in figure 13 , we label the bright central source ( at 3 cm ) as knot a , the first knot to the south - east as knot b , and the second , fainter radio source as knot c. from our k - band spectra ( see fig . 11 ) we extract a log[h@xmath37/br@xmath18 ] ratio of 0.14 , which is confirmation of an agn in the nucleus ( mouri & taniguchi 1992 ) .",
    "agn - dominated fir emission is suggested by the fir flux ratios and the q - value for this galaxy ( see table 5 ) .",
    "ic 5063 is fascinating because it may be a merging system which contains one of the best - defined ionization cones known to date ( colina , sparks , & macchetto 1991 ) .",
    "it is an s0 galaxy with very peculiar dust lanes and emission - lines which define a cross - shape centered near the agn .",
    "colina et al . have suggested that the cross - shape has some of the characteristics of an ionization cone illuminated by an agn .",
    "to explain the increase in the excitation of the ionized gas with distance from the center , they suggested that this may be the result of decreasing density and a strong metallicity gradient in the central few arcsec .",
    "however , they could not completely rule out a local source of heating in the cone . of special significance is the fact that the orientation of the linear triple is coincident with the inner edge of the ionization cone reported by colina et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , in just the region where the ionized gas shows enhanced excitation .",
    "knot b ( see fig . 13 ) , in the 3 cm map , seems to coincide exactly with the peak in the brightness profile for both h@xmath14 and [ oi ]  @xmath16300 emission .",

    "but was not explained .",

    "we will argue below that this may be a signature of ionized gas being ejected supersonically into the surrounding ism in the form of plasmons .    in an h@xmath14 imaging survey of galaxies with far - infrared spectral energy distributions peaking near 60 @xmath11 m",
    ", heisler & vader ( 1995 ) showed that this galaxy has three bright knots along , roughly , but not exactly , the same position angle as the radio knots seen in our 3 cm image .",
    "it is interesting to note that radio knots a and b have similar strengths in h@xmath14 .",
    "we have recently obtained new iris nir long - slit spectra along the radio structure seen at 3 cm ( to be published later ) . the knot identified in the radio image as b contains both a nir continuum source and lines of [ feii ]  @xmath11.644@xmath11 m and br@xmath18 , with fainter ir emitting knots on either side (",
    "this confirms the existence of the nuclear [ feii ]  @xmath11.644@xmath11 m detected in our spectra obtained in 1994 october ) .",
    "thus , the heisler & vader h@xmath14 imaging and our nir spectroscopy suggest that the nucleus is knot b , although this is by no means clear .",
    "in particular , the absolute positions of the optical and infrared data are uncertain by about an arcsec , and can not therefore be accurately superimposed on the radio image .",
    "figures 13a , b show that there is a slight difference in relative position between the h@xmath14 knots ( shown as crosses ) and the 3 cm radio knots .",
    "figure 13a assumes that radio knot b is the nucleus and , hence , the h@xmath14 knot and knot b are made to align , whereas figure 13b assumes that radio knot a is the nucleus . in each case , the other h@xmath14 knots are offset from the radio knots .",
    "we therefore speculate , regardless of whether knot a or knot b is the nucleus , that these offsets are consistent with plasmons being ejected into a counter - clockwise rotating disk .",

    "we note that if two `` extra - nuclear '' radio blobs are indeed moving at a minimum of 80 km s@xmath6 relative to the surrounding gas , they would be highly supersonic relative to their surroundings and might naturally produce bow - shocks on their leading edge .",
    "it is therefore significant that the 6 cm map shows a bow - shock - like morphology ahead of the possible ejected plasma ( such emission might be produced by electrons trapped in tangled magnetic fields in the bow - shock ahead of the ejected material ) .",
    "further radio observations of higher dynamic range and spatial resolution may help to define this morphology better .",
    "other evidence to support the view that gas outflow from the agn is interacting with the ism of the inner disk are broad ( @xmath17600 km s@xmath6 ) , blueshifted absorption features seen against a disk of neutral hydrogen emission ( morganti et al .",

    "we emphasize that we are not suggesting that the overall morphology of the optical emission - line properties of ic 5063 are driven by the radio source , but rather that additional heating is occurring along one edge of the ionization cone that seems to be related to the radio structure .",

    "for example , on a plot of iras s(100)/s(12 ) versus s(60)/s(25 ) , the c - class sources cluster to warmer iras colors than the d - class sources . the l - class sources have a wide range of color temperatures , but the hottest galaxies are those with well defined highly collimated radio emission .",
    "it is not clear why the radio morphology and the iras colors are related , unless the higher colors relate to the orientation of the dust torus ( see for example heisler et al ( 1997 ) , and dopita et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ) , and by implication , the radio jet direction .    4 .",
    ") our ctio spectra for ngc 3393 and iras 11249 - 2859 show that the radio and optical emission - line gas is extended on roughly the same scale .",
    "in particular we detected , in [ oi ]  @xmath16300 , the radio knot to the south - east in iras 11249 - 2859 .",
    "ngc 7130 , another of the l - class sources , has been shown in the work of shields & filippenko ( 1990 ) to contain a significant amount of circumnuclear star - formation .",
    "the l classification of this galaxy is probably due to a bar along the same pa as the radio emission . because of the lack of optical and nir spectra we can not make any conclusions about the correlation of , or lack thereof , radio morphology with circumnuclear star - formation for the l - class sources .",
    "future papers are planned in order to shed light on this ;    5 . )",
    "the radio spectral indices for the core - regions of the sample are generally in a range consistent with synchrotron emission , either from the agn itself or from cosmic rays accelerated by star - formation activity .",
    "two notable exceptions are ngc 4507 ( l - class ) and ngc 7213 , whose low spectral indices indicate that they may suffer from free - free absorption of a thermal source . a likely source for the free - free absorption in the marginally resolved radio source ngc 7213 might be circumnuclear star - formation , as suggested by the brightness temperature of the radio emission .",
    "furthermore , the collimated structure seen in iras 11249 - 2859 contains knots that are flat - spectrum sources suggesting that they might be undergoing free - free absorption ;    6 . )",
    "ic 5063 , an l+d class radio source , has iras fluxes and a q - value consistent with agn - dominated emission , although spectroscopic confirmation of this statement is pending .",
    "the radio emission seen at 6 and 3 cm suggest that `` plasmons '' are being ejected from the nucleus into the disk of the galaxy , giving rise to extensive shocks , possibly a bow - shock morphology at 6 cm , and significant local heating of one edge of a well - defined ionization cone seen in optical emission lines . in the nucleus nir spectra revealed br@xmath18 , h@xmath37 and [ feii ] ( along with the co ( 2 - 0 ) bandhead feature ) ;    7 . )",
