    "stelle  @xcite has first introduced the quadratic curvature gravity of @xmath6 in addition to the einstein - hilbert action @xmath7 to improve the perturbative properties of einstein gravity .",
    "if @xmath8 , the renormalizability was achieved but the unitarity was violated for @xmath9 , indicating that the renormalizability and unitarity exclude to each other . although the @xmath10-term of providing massive graviton improves the ultraviolet divergence , it induces ghost excitations which spoil the unitarity simultaneously .",
    "the price one has to pay for making the theory renormalizable in this way is the loss of unitarity . after that work",
    ", the search for a consistent quantum gravity has mainly been suffered from obtaining a renormalizable and unitary quantum field theory .",
    "hence , a first requirement for the quantum gravity is to gain the unitarity , which means that the classical linearized theory has no tachyon and ghost in the particle content . to that end ,",
    "critical gravities have received much attention because they were considered as toy models for quantum gravity  @xcite . at the critical point , a degeneracy takes place in the ads spacetimes and thus , ghost - like massive gravitons become massless gravitons . in this case ,",
    "an equal amount of logarithmic modes should be considered for the critical gravity instead of massive gravitons .",
    "however , one has to resolve the non - unitarity problem of the log - gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , it shows that a rank-2 logarithmic conformal field theory ( lcft ) is dual to a critical gravity  @xcite .",
    "thus , the non - unitarity of log - gravity is closely related to the non - unitarity of the lcft which arises from the fact that the hamiltonian can not be diagonalized on the fields because of the jordan structure  @xcite . in order to avoid the non - unitarity",
    ", one has to truncate out the log - modes by imposing the ads boundary conditions .",
    "after truncation , there remains nothing for the unitary theory .",
    "a polycritical gravity was , recently , introduced to provide multiple critical points  @xcite which might be described by a higher rank lcft .",
    "a rank of the lcft refers to the dimensionality of the jordan cell .",
    "for example , the lcft dual to a critical gravity has a rank-2 jordan cell and thus , an operator has a logarithmic partner .",
    "the lcft dual to a tricritical gravity has rank-3 jordan cell and an operator has two logarithmic partners .",
    "in particular , a truncation allows an odd rank lcft to be a unitary conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite .",
    "a 3d six - derivative tricritical gravity was treated as a dual to a rank-3 lcft  @xcite , while a four - derivative critical gravity in four dimensions was considered as a dual to a rank-3 lcft  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that a consistent truncation of polycritical gravity may be realized at the linearized level for odd rank  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a non - linear tricritical gravity with rank-3 was investigated in three and four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a tricritical gravity was first considered in a six - derivative gravity in six dimensions  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a rank-3 and parity odd tricritical theory was considered in the context of four - derivative gravity known as three - dimensional generalized massive gravity ( 3dgmg )  @xcite .",
    "the 3dgmg is obtained by combining topologically massive gravity ( tmg )  @xcite with new massive gravity ( nmg )  @xcite .",
    "two tricritical points emerged in the 3dgmg parameter space , whose dual theory is a rank-3 lcft  @xcite .",
    "a truncation of the tricritical 3dgmg could be made by imposing @xmath11 with @xmath12 the abbott - deser - tekin charge for log - square boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "after truncation , a left - moving sector of cft remains as a unitary theory .    at this stage , we would like to point out two related works on the 3dgmg .",
    "a log - square mode was found when choosing the kerr - schild metric on the ads@xmath13 background  @xcite , where its dual lcft may not be properly defined . around the btz black hole background ,",
    "the authors  @xcite have confirmed the ads / lcft correspondence existing between the tricritical 3dgmg and a rank-3 finite temperature lcft by computing quasinormal frequencies of graviton approximately .",
    "however , the 3dgmg is regarded as a toy model for tricritical gravities .",
    "hence , it is desirable to obtain a four - dimensional generalized massive gravity ( 4dgmg ) .    in this work",
    ", we wish to construct the 4dgmg by combining quadratic curvature gravity with the chern - simons term .",
    "considering the ads@xmath0 vacuum solution together with the transverse - traceless gauge , we derive a linearized einstein equation , which is not a compact form as found in the 3dgmg .",
    "fortunately , taking the kerr - schild form for the metric perturbation , the linearized tensor equation reduces to a massive scalar equation on the ads@xmath0 . at the tricritical points , we obtain a log - square wave solution which is similar to the solution found in the 3dgmg  @xcite",
    "this is compared to the 3d tricritical gmg whose dual field theory is a rank-3 lcft .",
    "furthermore , we compute the linear excitation energy and conserved charges which turn out to be zero for log - square wave solutions .",
    "before we proceed , we remind the reader that the 3dgmg is obtained by combining nmg with tmg in three dimensions . inspired by it",
    ", we introduce the quadratic curvature gravity together with the chern - simons term @xcite in four dimensions as @xmath14\\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is a cosmological constant , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are parameters , while @xmath18 is a nondynamical field is treated as a dynamical field by adding its kinetic and potential terms . ] .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath18 is evident from the fact that the pontryagin density @xmath19 with @xmath20 is a total divergence @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18-term corresponds to a parity - violating term because it is parity odd under the parity operation : @xmath21=-[{}^{*}rr]$ ] .",
    "we note that @xmath18 should be included as @xmath22 in the equation of motion , indicating that it may spoil the diffeomorphism symmetry [ see eq.([bian ] ) ] .",
    "varying for @xmath23 on the action ( [ action ] ) leads to the einstein equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the 4d cotton tensor @xmath26 are given by ) in the literatures @xcite ] @xmath27 here , @xmath26 is a traceless and symmetric tensor .",
    "it is worth noting that applying @xmath28 to ( [ equa1 ] ) , we get a remaining term @xmath29~{}^{*}rr,\\ ] ] which should be zero because the bianchi identity should be satisfied as the consistency condition . if not ,",
    "a breaking of diffeomorphism - symmetry is being realized at the level of the equation of motion . for consistency ,",
    "solutions of this model should satisfy @xmath30 for @xmath31 since the other case of @xmath32 reduces to the quadratic curvature gravity . in this case",
    ", the diffeomorphism - symmetry could be restored dynamically .",
    "explicitly , it could be achieved in the equation of motion by choosing the ads@xmath0-vacuum , even though the symmetry - breaking may occur at the action level .",
    "we note that the the same happens when @xmath18 is treated as a lagrange multiplier .",
    "it is easily shown that eq.([equa1 ] ) has an ads@xmath0 solution @xmath33 whose geometrical quantities are given by @xmath34 in order to obtain the linearized einstein equation , we introduce the perturbation around the ads@xmath0 background as @xmath35 in this case , the linearized equation to ( [ equa1 ] ) can be written as @xmath36 where the linearized quantities @xmath37 @xcite and @xmath38 @xcite are given by @xmath39+\\bigg[a\\leftrightarrow b\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath40 let us choose the transverse gauge as @xmath41 substituting ( [ gauge ] ) into eq.([pert0 ] ) , the trace of the linearized equation ( [ pert0 ] ) becomes @xmath42=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when considering the traceless condition of @xmath43 . in order to eliminate a massive spin-0 mode , we choose @xcite @xmath44 in this case , eq.([pert ] ) yields @xmath45 which implies that one may choose the transverse traceless ( tt ) gauge @xmath46 substituting ( [ ab ] ) and ( [ gauge0 ] ) into ( [ pert0 ] ) leads to @xmath47 here",

    "actually , it could be achieved by choosing @xmath51 in the poincare coordinates @xmath52 for the ads@xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath53 has the dimension of [ mass]@xmath54 , @xmath55 is the ads@xmath0 curvature radius , and @xmath56 is the flat metric tensor defined as @xmath57    plugging ( [ ansat ] ) into ( [ mainp ] ) , one arrives at @xmath58=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alternatively , it leads to @xmath59 \\bigg(\\bar{\\nabla}^2-\\frac{2}{3}\\lambda\\bigg)h_{a^{'}d}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because two operations in eq.([master1 ] ) commute to each other . here",
    "@xmath60 is determined by @xmath61 which may generate the mass of graviton . in this case",
    ", @xmath60 is not a constant vector but a vector field .",
    "it is a formidable task to solve ( [ master1 - 1 ] ) directly because the 4d cotton term induces a complicated expression upon choosing @xmath60 in ( [ vc ] ) . in order to solve ( [ master1 - 1 ] ) ,",

    "now we wish to obtain tricritical points . for this purpose",

    "we remind the reader that these are two tricritical points , implying that there exists a three - fold degeneracy .    on the other hand , the quadratic curvature gravity  @xcite obtained from taking the @xmath91 limit in eq.([master3 ] ) has a critical point of @xmath92 . in this case ,",

    "1 shows two tricritical points and three critical points in the parameter space @xmath99 of the 4dgmg .",

    "in particular , combination of ( [ sol44 ] ) with ( [ sol55 ] ) yields the solution ( [ sol33 ] ) found in the quadratic curvature gravity  @xcite which provides the fourth - order perturbation equation at the critical point .",
    "on the other hand , one may use the covariant formalism for 4d chern - simons gravity  @xcite and quadratic curvature gravity  @xcite in asymptotically ads@xmath0 spacetimes to derive the conserved charges in the 4dgmg as @xmath131,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath132 with a killing vector @xmath133 and @xmath134 in these expressions , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are given by ( [ cottonp0 ] ) and ( [ leinstein ] ) . plugging ( [ ansat ] ) and ( [ metric1 ] ) into ( [ charge ] ) together with the killing vector @xmath137 and @xmath138 , then four quantities @xmath139 and",

    "it is well - known that the conserved charges of the energy and angular momentum can be obtained through the integration at spatial infinity if a timelike and a rotational killing vector are properly given .",
    "it suggests that in our case , the conserved charges of energy and angular momentum vanish because the ads - wave admits a nulllike killing vector @xmath153 only .",
    "also we would like to mention that the zero excitation energy and zero charges are due to the following sequential restriction from tensor to scalar : @xmath154{}~~2\\phi \\lambda_a\\lambda_b~~ \\xrightarrow[{\\rm gauge - fixing}]{}~~ \\lambda_a\\bar{\\nabla}^a \\phi=0.\\ ] ] hence , we conjecture that all ads - wave solutions ( [ logs1])-([sol55 ] ) including non - critical solutions do not provide the nonzero excitation energy and conserved charges .",
    "we have constructed the generalized massive gravity by combining quadratic curvature gravity with the chern - simons term in four dimensions .",
    "this 4dgmg is similar to the 3dgmg . considering the ads@xmath0 vacuum solution ,",
    "we have derived the linearized einstein equation , which is not a compact form compared with that of the 3dgmg . when the metric perturbation is chosen to be the kerr - schild form",
    ", however , the linearized tensor equation reduces to a massive scalar equation . at the tricritical points , we obtain a log - square wave solution whose dual field theory may not be properly defined .",
    "the absence of its dual lcft is compared to the 3d tricritical gmg whose dual is a rank-3 lcft .",
    "a difference between the 4dgmg and 3dgmg is that the former has the chern - simons term of @xmath155 with @xmath18 a nondynamical field , while the latter has the topologically massive term @xmath156 $ ] with @xmath157 a parameter , even though two terms belong to parity - violating term .",
    "the presence of @xmath18 in the 4dgmg may prevent us from having its dual lcft at the tricritical point because it is not a constant like @xmath158 in the 3dgmg but a nondynamical field .",
    "most of all , choosing @xmath159 makes the linearized equation complicated on the ads@xmath0 spacetimes , which implies that the linearized equation ( [ mainp ] ) can not be written by a compact form like as in the ads@xmath13 spacetimes @xmath160 here @xmath161 is the metric perturbation around the ads@xmath13 and operators ( @xmath162 ) are given in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the compact equation ( [ difform ] ) expressed in one - dimensional operators is obtained only after choosing the ads - wave .",
    "this implies that the parity - odd tricritical gravity theory in the 4dgmg could not be described by its dual higher rank lcft .",
    "however , it was discussed in the 4d quadratic curvature gravity  @xcite that at the critical point , the ads - wave log solutions may provide a dual lcft@xmath13 , while at off - critical point , its dual theory may correspond to a nonrelativistic field theory with fixed boundary conditions .",
    "it suggests that a similar thing may happen at the tricritical point and off - tricritical point in the 4dgmg .",
    "however , an explicit construction of its dual cft is beyond the scope of the present work and thus , it is left as a future work .",
