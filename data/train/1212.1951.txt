    "disorder is ubiquitous in nature .",
    "the issue of universal properties of disordered systems has sparked much interest , both experimental and theoretical , beginning with anderson localization in electronic systems , and by now including phenomena observable in a wide range of physical systems .",
    "transport in one - dimensional ( 1d ) disordered systems , being the simplest problem , is naturally the first to be understood .",
    "studies on electronic conductivity by modeling a 1d wire as an array of potentials with random shapes and/or random spacings abound . for an excellent review of the state of affairs for 1d systems in 1982 ,",
    "we refer the reader to the article by erds and herndon.@xcite overviews of subsequent developments can be found in refs .  , , and .",
    "despite the comprehensive understanding of the 1d problem , owing to the difficulty of the subject , exact analytical results are few and far between .",
    "perturbative treatments , typically in the limit of weak scattering , are the main tools for analytical studies : the scaling theory,@xcite the born approximation for scattering,@xcite the dmpk equation,@xcite and many more .",
    "exact results emerge mostly from numerical studies , or from the group - theoretic approaches of refs .  , , and , which apply in general situations , but are nevertheless somewhat complicated because of the use of direct products of transfer matrices .",
    "in this article , we revisit the simplest problem of a 1d single - scattering - channel system where the disorder in question is one of uniformly distributed phase disorder . a physical realization of a system manifesting such a disorder comprises a stack of identical semi - transparent glass plates , with random spacings between adjacent plates .",
    "the task is to explore the transmission of a laser beam through the random stack .",
    "because the typical separation between plates is much larger than the wavelength of the light , a uniform distribution of separation will describe the phase disorder well .",
    "such a system was already considered by stokes @xcite in 1862 , who gave a ray - optical treatment .",
    "wave - optical investigations came much later ; see ref .   for the history of the subject .",
    "in fact , the 1984 work by perel and polyakov @xcite deals with a more general 1d transport problem that is treated with pertinent approximations ; the situation considered here is contained as a special case , for which these approximations are not needed .",
    "this particular case was also investigated by berry and klein @xcite in 1997 ( which work inspired our current efforts ) .",
    "we employ a different strategy that exploits fully the recurrence relation established in ref .  , which facilitates an exact yet simple analytical treatment .",
    "disorder average of all moments of the conductance and resistance ( that is , the transmission probability and its reciprocal ) can be derived easily within a single framework .",
    "the same framework further permits direct derivation of the exact probability distributions for the conductance and resistance , which allows for computation of all statistics of the disordered system .",
    "this goes beyond past work that reconstructed the distribution for the conductance from its moments,@xcite or derivations that relied on perturbative approaches.@xcite the simplicity in our solution lies in a relation with legendre functions , whose properties are well studied and are easily amenable to analytical manipulations .",
    "our exact solution for this simple model can conceivably be used as the starting point for perturbation towards other more realistic systems ( see , for instance , the recent experimental proposal of ref .  ) .",
    "the article will proceed as follows : after setting up the problem in section [ sec : setup ] , we describe ( section [ sec : recur ] ) how to average over disorder using a recurrence relation , previously derived in ref .  .",
    "this recurrence relation is applicable even for general disorder .",
    "specializing to uniform phase disorder , in sections [ sec : resistance ] and [ sec : conductance ] , we make use of a close link to legendre functions to write down closed - form expressions for the expected values of moments of conductance and resistance .",
    "comparisons with existing results in the weak - scattering , long - chain limit are presented in section [ sec : weakscat ] .",
    "the recurrence relation also gives the exact probability distributions for the conductance and the resistance , and these probability distributions are studied in detail in section [ sec : prob ] .",
    "we close with a summary in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "consider a 1d chain of scatterers , such as a stack of semi - transparent glass plates , or a string of impurities .",
    "both the scatterer and the scattered particle are assumed to be scalar particles , or at least only scalar degrees of freedom participate in the scattering process .",
    "the scatterers are identical , but sit at locations with varying distances between adjacent scatterers .",
    "the distances between adjacent scatterers are the random variables in our system  the disorder .",
    "the scattering of the particle off the @xmath0th scatterer can be summarized by a transfer matrix @xmath1 which propagates the wave function of the scattered particle past the @xmath0th scatterer ( see figure [ fig : figtransfer ] ) .",
    "@xmath1 is obtained by solving the scattering problem for the @xmath0th scatterer , and accounts for multiple scattering off the same scatterer due to reflected waves from adjacent scatterers . for our problem",
    ", @xmath1 can be decomposed into two parts , @xmath2 where @xmath3 describes the scattering due to the @xmath0th scatterer itself , and @xmath4 accounts for the phase acquired by the scattered particle in traveling distance @xmath5 between the @xmath0th and ( @xmath0 + 1)th scatterers .",
    "@xmath3 takes the general form    @xmath6    here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote overall phases , and @xmath9 contains the transmission amplitude @xmath10^{-1}$ ] and the reflection amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "since the scatterers are identical , the same @xmath3 describes every scatterer .",
    "the disorder that stems from the variable separation between adjacent scatterers is characterized by @xmath5 , for @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) .",
    "the total transfer matrix , for a fixed configuration of @xmath14 scatterers , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath22 can be recursively expressed in terms of @xmath23 and the individual spacings @xmath5 .",
    "this can be understood by adding one more scatterer to the end of the chain of @xmath14 scatterers .",
    "the total transfer matrix is now @xmath24 , with @xmath25 obeying the composition law @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is twice the phase sandwiched between the two matrices @xmath9 and @xmath28 , and is given in this case by @xmath29 .",
    "we can regard @xmath30 , in place of @xmath5 , as the parameter that represents the disorder in our system .",
    "composition laws can also be written down for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , but they will not enter our analysis .    as a convenient shorthand , we will use the notation @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , one can define @xmath35 and @xmath36 so that the composition law appears succinctly as @xmath37 the total transmission probability ( or dimensionless conductance , in the language of transport on 1d wires ) after @xmath14 scatterers is @xmath38 the value of @xmath39 depends sensitively on the configuration of the scatterers , that is , on the values of the phases @xmath30 .",

    "@xmath40 is the wave function of the scattered particle just before it hits the @xmath0th scatterer , and can be written in terms of left- and right - moving waves as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the momentum of the scattered particle . ]",
    "rather than focusing on a particular configuration of the @xmath14 scatterers , one is usually more interested in statistics of the entire ensemble of configurations .",
    "this requires a statement about the nature of the disorder , namely , the probability distribution @xmath43 for @xmath30 . more generally , one can have correlated disorder , where the @xmath30 values are not statistically independent , but this is beyond the scope of our current discussion .",
    "the transmission of @xmath14 scatterers , averaged over the disorder , is then @xmath44 the dependences on @xmath45 are implicit in @xmath46 . writing out these dependences in full can be very complicated without being enlightening .    to simplify the problem",
    ", we assume that the disorder is uniformly distributed , which permits the replacement @xmath47 in the disorder average . here",
    ", the subscript @xmath48 denotes integration over any @xmath49-interval of our choice .",
    "a uniform distribution is a good description whenever the separation between adjacent scatterers is itself uniformly distributed .",
    "it also describes the physical situation whenever @xmath50 for some typical separation @xmath51 between scatterers .",
    "this often applies for monochromatic light scattered by a stack of semi - transparent glass plates with layers of air between them . in the case of a chain of ions trapped in a lattice , thermal motion of the ions within the trapping potential leads to random separation between adjacent ions .",
    "the separation is usually concentrated around some central value @xmath51 , but for an electron incident with large momentum @xmath42 , the phase @xmath52 will explore many cycles of @xmath49 over even small deviations of @xmath5 from @xmath51 .",
    "a uniform distribution for @xmath53 is then a fitting description .      to proceed with our analysis , we recall that the composition law allows us to compute @xmath54 recursively with the aid of the recurrence relation derived in ref .  .",

    ", we obtain @xmath222 here , we have approximated @xmath223 as before , and also made use of an integral representation for @xmath119 of the form @xcite @xmath224 the limiting expression in eq .",
    "is identical to the distribution for @xmath46 found in ref .   by solving the dmpk equation , and also in ref .   for the resistance in the anderson model .",
    "this lends credibility to eq .",
    ", even for moments of the resistance .",
    "furthermore , the fact that @xmath225^m$ ] is not square - integrable is perhaps not troublesome because @xmath226 for @xmath227 ( although not apparent from eq .  ) , so that the @xmath59 integral in @xmath148 cuts off at @xmath228 rather than extending to infinity .",
    "a different source of concern lies with how the singularity of the delta function in @xmath102 propagates as @xmath14 grows . for @xmath229 ,",
    "the singularity occurs at @xmath230 ; for @xmath231 , it occurs at @xmath109 , since @xmath232 ; for @xmath233 , the singularity is at @xmath230 again ( see appendix [ app : wn ] ) ; for @xmath234 , it goes back to @xmath109 .",
    "in fact , for any even @xmath14 , we expect @xmath235 to be particularly large ( or even infinite ) , because , as explained in detail in appendix [ app : wn ] , there exists an infinite family of phase configurations that attain @xmath109 whenever @xmath14 is even .",
    "since @xmath236 , this large value of @xmath235 for @xmath14 even is inherited by @xmath237 for @xmath14 odd .",
    "this again suggests that the large value of @xmath80 occurs at values that are different for @xmath14 even and @xmath14 odd , putting into suspect the existence of an asymptotic probability distribution for large @xmath14 .",
    "fortunately , using our exact expressions for @xmath80 , one can show that beyond @xmath234 , @xmath80 becomes finite everywhere , and the singularity present in small @xmath14 values goes away ; see appendix [ app : wn ] for a detailed analysis .",
    "this justifies the validity of the reconstruction of the probability distribution of the conductance via its moments in ref .  , which relies on a fourier transform that comes with an ",
    "equal almost everywhere \" condition that automatically gets rid of singularities with zero measure .",
    "we have shown how one can analytically derive the statistics of a 1d chain of identical scatterers of any length , with uniform phase disorder . making use of the fact that legendre functions are eigenfunctions of the recurrence relation governing the chain statistics , we obtained disorder - averaged moments of the resistance by expanding in terms of legendre polynomials ; disorder - averaged moments of the conductance came from expanding in terms of the mehler functions via the mehler - fock transformation .",
    "the probability distributions of the conductance and the resistance can also be written in terms of the recurrence relation , and we pointed out singularities absent in existing derivations .",
    "these extra features , despite the fact that they play little role in the physics in the end , remind us of the importance of exact and analytical solutions , which may be the only way of identifying subtle properties and verifying the validity of common assumptions .",

    "here , we examine in detail the argument outlined in section [ sec : prob ] regarding singularities in @xmath80 .",
    "we begin by studying how @xmath80 behaves for small @xmath14 near @xmath109 for @xmath14 even , and @xmath230 for @xmath14 odd .",
    "since @xmath91 , it is singular at @xmath230 . for @xmath251",
    ", we have @xmath252^{-1/2},\\ ] ] which is singular at @xmath109 . near the singularity",

    "@xmath257 is the complete elliptic integral,@xcite @xmath258 which is finite everywhere for @xmath259 except at @xmath260 , corresponding to the point where @xmath230 .",
    "expanding @xmath261 about @xmath260 ( see , for example , ref .  )",
    ", we can extract the behavior near the singularity , @xmath262 @xmath263 for @xmath109 is also singular , with a behavior identical to that of @xmath254 in the vicinity of @xmath230 . beyond @xmath233 ,",
    "it becomes difficult to obtain a closed - form expression for @xmath80 .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath14 even , we expect @xmath235 to be particularly large .",
    "this can be understood in the following way : @xmath264 corresponds to perfect transmission through all @xmath14 scatterers . for @xmath14 even , every configuration of phases @xmath265 such that @xmath266 , and @xmath267 , for @xmath268 , gives @xmath109 .",
    "there are thus infinitely many perfect - transmission configurations , since only the sum of each pair is constrained , but not the individual phases ( apart from the central one ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 is stationary , as the @xmath30s vary , at @xmath109 .",
    "this stationary property , together with the infinite family of configurations attaining @xmath109 , will give a large , possibly infinite , value of @xmath269 at @xmath109 .",
    "this large value of @xmath235 for @xmath14 even is inherited by @xmath237 for @xmath14 odd because @xmath236 .",
    "this difference between @xmath14 even and @xmath14 odd in the location of the large , possibly singular value of @xmath269 puts the existence of an asymptotic probability distribution as @xmath270 under suspicion .",
    "fortunately , one can show that beyond @xmath234 , @xmath80 becomes finite everywhere , and the singularity present for small @xmath14 values goes away .",
    "the points of suspicion are at @xmath109 for @xmath14 even and @xmath230 for @xmath14 odd .",
    "we note that we can write @xmath271 as can be shown using the symmetry property eq .   of @xmath55 .",
    "then , we have @xmath272 since @xmath273 is singular at one point @xmath274 , the vicinity of that singularity dominates the integral , but the logarithmic singularity behavior from , after squaring and integrating , becomes finite .",
    "this immediately also tells us that is finite .",
    "thereafter , for larger @xmath14 , we have @xmath80 finite everywhere .",
