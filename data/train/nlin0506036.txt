    "notice that @xmath103 is self - adjoint , thus @xmath99 s eigenvalues are either purely real , or purely imaginary .",

    "the zero eigenvalue always has multiplicity 6  three from position and phase invariances ( goldstein modes ) , and the other three from velocity and frequency ( or equivalently , amplitude ) variations .",
    "when an internal mode exists , a pair of real eigenvalues of opposite sign are present as well",
    ". if two vector solitons form a widely - separated stationary bound state @xmath109 , both solitons must be either wave - and - daughter - waves ( with @xmath110 and @xmath34 ) , or having nearly equal amplitudes in the two components ( with @xmath35 and @xmath111 ) @xcite ( only the former type of bound states is studied in this paper ) .",

    "for instance , single vector solitons in fig . 1 s bound states do not have internal modes @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath106 has only a single discrete eigenvalue zero of multiplicity 6 . in a bound state of two wave - and - daughter - waves , @xmath99",
    "will then have 12 discrete eigenvalues ( multiplicities counted )  double that for a single wave - and - daughter - wave . here",
    ", no new discrete eigenvalues of @xmath99 can be generated from edge bifurcations of @xmath106 because the edge points of @xmath106 s continuous spectrum are not in the continuous spectrum .",
    "now the zero eigenvalue of @xmath99 still has multiplicity 6 .",
    "another six eigenvalues of @xmath99 must bifurcate from zero due to tail interactions between solitons .",
    "tracking of these six bifurcated eigenvalues will then provide a complete characterization of linear stability for these two - soliton bound states .",
    "in this section , we propose a new and general tail - matching method to derive explicit analytical formulas for the six eigenvalues of @xmath99 that bifurcate from zero , under the condition that the individual vector solitons in the bound state are widely separated .",
    "the idea of this method is to perturbatively determine the bifurcated eigenstate around each vector soliton . by matching their tail asymptotics in the center region of the eigenstate , their asymptotics in that region",
    "can then be explicitly obtained . finally by utilizing",
    "the solvability conditions for the eigenstate , analytical formulas for the bifurcated eigenvalues will be derived .",
    "these formulas turn out to be exactly the same as those obtained by the ksgo method @xcite , but the present method is much simpler .",
    "the bifurcated eigenvalues are of two types .",
    "one type consists of a pair of eigenvalues which bifurcate from the position - related zero eigenvalue . at infinite soliton separation",

    "the other type consists of two pairs of eigenvalues which bifurcate from the phase - related zero eigenvalue . at infinite soliton separation ,",
    "these eigenstates are equal to the sum of two phase - induced goldstein modes separated infinitely apart .",
    "these two types of eigenvalues have their counterparts in the linear stability analysis by the ksgo method @xcite .",
    "below , we consider eigenvalue bifurcations in type - i and ii bound states .",
    "it turns out that eigenvalues of type - ii bound states are simply equal to those of type - i states multiplied by @xmath112 ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "as pointed in @xcite , this formula shows that a two - vector - soliton bound state always has one phase - related unstable eigenvalue which bifurcates from zero , thus is always linearly unstable .",
    "comparison between this formula and numerical values has also been made in @xcite , and excellent agreement has been observed .",
    "formula ( [ quartic ] ) shows that phase - related eigenvalues @xmath158 , the same as position - related eigenvalues [ see eq .",
    "( [ positionlambda ] ) ] .",
    "the asymptotics of these eigenvalues in the limit @xmath159 can also be obtained from ( [ deltalimit ] ) and ( [ quartic ] ) , but is not pursued here .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the linear stability of type - ii vector - soliton bound states [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . in the limit of large separation , these solitons have the asymptotics @xmath187 repeating the above analytical calculations , we find that the eigenvalues for type - ii states are equal to those of type - i states multiplied by @xmath112 . thus type - ii states are always linearly unstable as well . but different from type - i states , the instability of type - ii states in the limit @xmath156 is caused by two unstable eigenvalues : one related to position - mode bifurcations [ see ( [ positionlambda ] ) ] , and the other one related to phase - mode bifurcations [ see ( [ quartic ] ) ] .",
    "this result agrees with that by the ksgo method as well as the numerical result @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have analytically studied the linear stability of two - vector - soliton bound states in the coupled nls equations by a new tail - matching method . under the condition that the two vector solitons are wave - and - daughter - waves and are widely separated",
    ", we have calculated small eigenvalues of these bound states that bifurcate from the zero eigenvalue of single vector solitons .",
    "these small eigenvalues calculated are all the discrete non - zero eigenvalues of the bound states .",
    "we have shown that these bound states are always linearly unstable due to the existence of one unstable phase - induced eigenvalue .",
    "the analytical formulas for eigenvalues derived from this tail - matching method turn out to be exactly the same as those from the ksgo method @xcite , but the present method is much simpler . even though our calculations were performed for two - vector - soliton bound states",
    ", these calculations can apparently be generalized to @xmath188-vector - soliton bound states .",
    "this tail - matching method for the linear stability analysis of multi - soliton bound states is apparently quite general , and it can be applied to a wide range of other wave systems where similar multi - pulse bound states have been reported @xcite .",
    "in addition , this method should be applicable to the stability analysis of other types of multi - pulses from nonlocal bifurcations in coupled - nls - type equations @xcite .",
    "preliminary linear stability results through numerical studies shows that such multi - pulses are also linearly unstable @xcite , consistent with the results of the present article .",
    "this tail - matching method can also be used to calculate eigenvalue bifurcations of multi - pulses from internal modes ( non - zero eigenvalues ) of single pulses  a bifurcation which incidentally does not arise in the present problem because internal modes do not exist in single wave - and - daughter - waves @xcite .    under what conditions can this tail - matching method give useful results ?",
    "the main condition is that the individual pulses in the multi - pulse bound state are widely separated .",
    "this condition will dictate in what parameter regions such multi - pulses can exist , and thus tail - matching can proceed . for instance , for the coupled nls equations ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) , the spacing formulas ( [ spacing ] ) and ( [ deltalimit ] ) dictate that widely - separated multi - vector - soliton bound states ( @xmath32 ) exist when @xmath6 is near the local bifurcation boundary @xmath189 .",
    "this is precisely the parameter region where our tail - matching linear stability analysis is performed .",
    "the two - vector - soliton bound states studied in this paper reside outside the continuous spectrum of the corresponding linear - wave system .",
    "it is known that multi - pulse embedded solitons residing inside the continuous spectrum exist in various wave systems as well @xcite .",
    "an interesting open issue is whether the tail - matching method can also be applied to the linear stability analysis of such multi - pulse embedded solitons . in the third - order nls equation , it has been shown numerically that such embedded solitons are all linearly stable , but nonlinearly semi - stable @xcite .",
    "lastly , we relate this tail - matching method to other existing techniques for the linear stability analysis of multi - pulse bound states .",
    "currently , the following techniques exist : the ksgo method @xcite , the dynamical - system method @xcite , and the effective - interaction - potential method @xcite .",
    "the present method is asymptotically accurate .",
    "it gives the same results as the ksgo method , but is much simpler .",
    "the dynamical - system method can count the number of unstable eigenvalues , or express the eigenvalues as the zeros of the evans function .",
    "but it generally does not produce explicit formulas for eigenvalues .",
    "the effective - potential method can only capture position - related eigenvalue bifurcations , not phase - related eigenvalue bifurcations .",
    "( for the coupled nls equations , phase - related eigenvalues are more important ) . in view of this comparison",
    ", we feel that the tail - matching method for the linear stability of multi - soliton bound states is very promising .",
