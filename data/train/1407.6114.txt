    "materials with layered structure have been intensively studied as a promising approach to the exploration of new high transition temperature superconductors , since the discovery of cuprate superconductors@xcite . this scheme has been accelerated and become much more fruitful by the discovery of the iron - based superconductors@xcite and the following tremendous research .",
    "both the cuprate and iron - based superconductors have a layered structure consisting of the so - called superconducting layers ( cuo@xmath0 layer , fe@xmath0m@xmath0(m = as , p , s , se or te)layer ) and the blocking charge reservoir layers@xcite .",
    "superconductivity occurs when charge carriers are generated in the charge reservoir layers and transferred into the superconducting layers . by changing the blocking layers or intercalating some molecular space layers , a lot of derivative superconductors with the same superconducting layers are discovered@xcite .",
    "recently , novel bis@xmath0-based superconductivity has been reported in layered compound bi@xmath7o@xmath7s@xmath8 @xcite , which is composed of bi@xmath0o@xmath0(so@xmath7)@xmath9 ( x=0.5 ) blocking layers and bis@xmath0 superconducting layers .",
    "subsequently , an analogous series of bis@xmath0-based superconductors are discovered , including reo@xmath10f@xmath11bis@xmath0 ( re= la , ce , nd , yb , pr)@xcite , la@xmath10m@xmath11obis@xmath0 ( m= ti , zr , hf , th)@xcite , and sr@xmath10la@xmath11fbis@xmath0@xcite , ect .",
    "the transition temperature of the bis@xmath12-based superconductors can be as high as 10.6 k@xcite .",
    "these reports suggest that it is possible to discover more bis@xmath0-derivative superconducting materials .",
    "very recently , superconductivity with transition temperature of 2.4 k has been reported in lao@xmath6f@xmath6bise@xmath0 polycrystalline sample@xcite .",
    "this discovery is of great importance since it represents a novel bise@xmath0-based superconducting system .",
    "however , due to the lack of single crystal , the superconducting properties remain to be investigated . in this paper",
    ", we report the successful growth of lao@xmath10f@xmath11bise@xmath0 single crystal samples by flux method .",
    "the superconducting parameters are determined based on the high - quality single crystals .",
    "the lao@xmath10f@xmath11bise@xmath0 single crystals were grown by flux method using a mixture of cscl and kcl as the flux ( the molar ratio of cscl : kcl is 5 : 3)@xcite .",
    "the starting materials of high - purity bi@xmath0o@xmath8 , bif@xmath8 , bismuth , lanthanum and selenium were weighed with nominal concentrations of lao@xmath10f@xmath11bise@xmath0 and thoroughly ground in an agate mortar .",
    "then the flux of cscl and kcl were added , with the mass ratio of cscl / kcl to raw materials of 1 : 8 .",
    "the total mixture was thoroughly ground and then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "it was slowly heated to @xmath13 and kept for 48 h followed by cooling down at a rate of 2 k / h to @xmath14 before the furnace was shut down . after cooling down to the room temperature",
    ", the product was removed from the quartz tube and washed by distilled water to get the single crystal samples .",
    "the real compositions of the obtained single crystals were determined by an energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) analysis , which was performed using oxford swift3000 spectroscopy equipped with a si detector .",
    "the edx measurement were done on several pieces of single crystals randomly selected from each sample . for each piece",
    ", at least six different points were randomly selected in the edx measurements and the average was defined as the actual composition .",
    "the structure of the obtained crystal was characterized by powder and single crystal x - ray diffraction with cu - k@xmath15 at room temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of resistivity from 2 k to 300 k was measured by a standard four - probe method in a commercial quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms-14 t ) system .",
    "magnetic properties were performed using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetmeter . the specific heat measured by a thermal relaxation method from 20 k down to 1.9 k",
    "was also performed on ppms-14 t system .",
    "figure 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy photograph of the lao@xmath16f@xmath17bise@xmath18 sample .",
    "the obtained single crystal samples have typical dimensions of 2@xmath14@xmath10.2 mm@xmath2 . in order to determine the actual compositions of the samples we perform an energy - dispersive x - ray spectrometry ( edx ) analysis on the as - grown single crystals .",
    "the results are given in table 1 .",
    "the obtained values are normalized by la = 1 , and the oxygen content is defined as 1-@xmath19 ( @xmath19 is the content of f ) , considering the inaccuracy of oxygen by edx measurement .",
    "no cs , k , and cl elements are detected in the samples . for la ,",
    "bi and se elements , the relative ratio agrees well with the stoichiometric ratio except for a little deficiency of se , which is similar to the deficiency of s in ndo@xmath10f@xmath11bis@xmath0 single crystals @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the actual f concentration increases with increasing nominal f content",
    ". however , the actual f content saturates at about 0.5 ( for example , the actual f content is @xmath19=0.52 in the sample with nominal content of @xmath19=0.9 ) .",
    "another noticeable fact is that for the samples with nominal contents @xmath19=0.2 and @xmath19=0.3 , the actual f contents are about 0.37 and 0.38 , which are significantly higher than the nominal contents .",
    "these results indicate that in the lao@xmath10f@xmath11bise@xmath0 single crystals , the preferred f content is in the @xmath19=0.3 - 0.6 region .",

    "as the @xmath51 value for the lao@xmath3f@xmath4bise@xmath5 sample is about 1 t , we adopt the data taken from the 0 - 1 t range to make the fit for @xmath45@xmath52 .",

    "as the phononic contribution ( @xmath61@xmath62 ) is usually independent on applied magnetic field , we get the electronic specific heat by @xmath63=@xmath59(0 t)-@xmath59(10 t ) .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "5 shows the temperature dependence of electronic specific heat in the normal and superconducting state .",
    "the electronic specific heat jump at transition temperature ( 3.3 k ) is evaluated to be @xmath64c@xmath56/@xmath45@xmath65 = 1.38 .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath64c@xmath56/@xmath45@xmath65 is comparable to the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer weak - coupling limit value 1.43 .",

    "in summary , we report the successful growth of lao@xmath10f@xmath11bise@xmath0 superconduting single crystals for the first time .",
