    "<S> the eth group used a pumping beam ( along the @xmath0 direction ) and two external lattice beams ( along the @xmath1 and @xmath2 direction ) to form a three - dimensional lattice , as schemed in fig .  1 , in which the bosonic atoms can undergo a superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulator ( mi ) transition when the lattice depth increases . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , solely tuning the strength of the pumping beam can drive a superradiant transition where the expectation value of the cavity light field ( along the @xmath2 direction ) changes from zero to finite . </S>",
    "<S> once inside the superradiant phase , the interference between the cavity light and the pumping light gives rise to an additional check - board lattice in the @xmath3 plane where a charge - density - wave ( cdw ) order of the bosons forms accordingly @xcite , and the superradiant phase transition of the cavity light is accompanied with a cdw transition of the bosons . </S>",

    "<S> first , in contrast to what is suggested in the experiment , in our theory , unless for a fine - tuned chemical potential , the four different phases generically shall not meet at the same point . </S>",
    "<S> second , the first order sf to cdw - sf transition has not been observed yet . </S>",
    "<S> this difference may be due to the inhomogeneity of the experimental system in a harmonic trap , in which case the data are effectively an average over a range of chemical potentials , and also partly due to the finite resolution of the experiment measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical predictions shall stimulate future experimental efforts in determining the phase diagram of this system more accurately .    </S>",
    "<S> we should also mention the difference between the eth setup and the hamburg setup . in the hamburg experiment </S>",
    "<S> , there is no external lattice beam along the cavity direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that means , if not in the superradiant phase , there is no lattice potential along the cavity direction and hence the system can not be a mi . therefore , there is no normal mi phase in their phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the cdw - sf to cdw - mi transition is driven by the cavity light . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it happens when cavity field is sufficient strong and our approximation that @xmath70 and @xmath20 are independent of @xmath41 can not apply . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in the hamburg setup @xmath38 is relatively small , which makes both the guassian approximation to the wannier wave functions and the steady state approximation to the cavity field less accurate . </S>",
