    "the cluster environment strongly affects the star - formation history of cluster members .",
    "galaxies in the centers of clusters are observed to be redder and more evolved than galaxies on the outskirts of the cluster , as well as field galaxies at the same redshift @xcite .",
    "thus , the most massive clusters today likely formed in short episodes of vigorous star formation that effectively ceased by @xmath4 @xcite . theoretical simulations of cluster formation and evolution support this scenario @xcite . however , using old stellar populations to reconstruct the star formation conditions and to understand why star formation ceased in clusters is extremely difficult .",
    "recently , several galaxy clusters have been discovered in the `` redshift desert '' ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . with near - infrared multi - object spectroscopy on 8 - 10 m telescopes ,",
    "it is now possible to study the star formation conditions in these clusters , prior to ( or during ) the end of their major star - forming episodes .    near infrared spectroscopy probes the optical rest - frame emission - lines at @xmath0 , providing a wealth of information about the ionized gas surrounding the young , hot stars .",

    "these elevated line ratios may indicate a major change in the ionized gas or star formation properties as a function of time .",

    "sample selection is likely to play a large role in the relative importance of each of these factors @xcite .",
    "if the cluster environment causes more rapid evolution during the star - formation stage than in the field , then we might expect a difference in the ism conditions in clusters at high redshift compared with field galaxies .",
    "the star - formation properties of high redshift cluster galaxies relative to the field are currently under debate . using stacked near - infrared spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite suggested that the relationship between star formation and stellar mass is similar among cluster and field galaxies at @xmath0 .",

    "the [ ] /h@xmath1  ratio is particularly sensitive to the hardness of the ionizing radiation field because the [ ]  lines are produced in a partially ionized zone that is large when the radiation field contains a significant fraction of high energy ( x - ray and euv ) photons . finally , the combination of the [ ] / [ ]  and [ ] /h@xmath2  ratios separate the ionization parameter and the metallicity , as shown in @xcite .",

    "the ratio of [ ] / [ ]  is also sensitive to metallicity , particularly for metallicities below @xmath39@xmath119 .",
    "this metallicity sensitivity occurs because the ratio of collisional excitation rates of [ ]  and [ ]  is a weak function of nebular temperature , which becomes high at low metallicities due to the lack of coolants in the nebula .",

    "the oxygen lines in the optical and the infrared dominate the cooling of the nebula , leading to less collisional excitations of the @xmath84 ion , and a stronger dependency between [ ] /h@xmath2  and metallicity .    in figure  [ niisii_oiiihb ]",
