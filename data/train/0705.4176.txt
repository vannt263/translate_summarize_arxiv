    "@xcite the unusual features of fqh states have been notoriously difficult to characterize using traditional condensed - matter concepts such as local order parameters and @xmath1-point correlation functions .    in a separate development , recent years have seen growing understanding that entanglement measures borrowed from the discipline of quantum information can be useful in probing global features of quantum many - particle states . @xcite it is thus natural to ask what features of fqh states can be characterized by entanglement measures . in a recent short report,@xcite",
    "three of the present authors have shown that one such entanglement measure , the _",
    "bipartite entanglement entropy _ , indeed elucidates the subtle correlations and topological order in the simplest fqh states , those in the so - called laughlin sequence . the bipartite entanglement entropy is defined by partitioning the system under question into two blocks @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and using the reduced density matrix of one part ( e.g. , @xmath4 obtained by tracing over @xmath3 degrees of freedom ) to calculate the von neumann entropy @xmath5 $ ] .    in ref .",
    ", numerical calculations of the entanglement entropy between two spatial regions allowed us to extract from the laughlin wavefunctions the so - called _ topological entanglement entropy _",
    ", a concept introduced in ref .  .",
    "[ for brevity we write _ topological entropy _ where no confusion can arise . ] in addition , we provided results on the entanglement entropy between subsets of the particles making up the state .",
    "we showed that such _ particle entanglements _ are bounded by expressions that manifest the exclusion statistics in the laughlin states .    in this article , we present a systematic discussion of bipartite entanglement entropies for fqh states , elaborating on our results in ref .  .",
    "in addition to the abelian laughlin ( l ) states , we consider a series of non - abelian fqh states : the moore - read ( mr ) ( or pfaffian ) states .",
    "@xcite in planar geometry , the respective wavefunctions are given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 denoting the antisymmetric pfaffian symbol .",
    "we shall here consider these same states in spherical geometry , so as to eliminate boundary effects .    for both series of states ,",
    "we derive upper bounds @xmath8 for particle entanglement entropies .",
    "a marked difference between the @xmath9 laughlin state and the @xmath10 moore - read states is that in the latter the leading correlations have a 3-body nature , whereas those in the laughlin states are 2-body effects .",

    "we extract values for @xmath0 directly from wavefunctions for a limited number of particles in spherical geometry ( up to @xmath15 for the @xmath9 laughlin state and up to @xmath16 for the @xmath10 moore - read state ) , finding values that are consistent with the expected result .",
    "these results illustrate how the entanglement entropy can be used in diagnosing the topological order for a fqh state that is only known in the form of wavefunctions for a limited number of particles , as is often the case in numerical studies .",
    "in section [ sec_partition - choices ] we give a general discussion of possible bipartite entanglement measures in itinerant many body systems , carefully distinguishing between _ particle _ and _ spatial _ partitioning schemes . in section [ sec_pcle - partition ]",
    "we present analytical and numerical results for particle entanglement in the laughlin and moore - read fqh states . in this , the eigenvalue distribution of the reduced density matrix @xmath17 plays a central role . in subsection [ sec_pcle - rdm - n - corrln - fn ]",
    "we relate the eigenvalue distribution for @xmath18 to the two - particle correlation function @xmath19 . in section [ sec_spatial - n - gamma ]",
    "we discuss spatial partitioning , paying particular attention to the numerical procedure followed in extracting the topological entropy @xmath0 .    while most results in this article are for fermionic fqh states ( meaning @xmath20 odd in the laughlin sequence and @xmath20 even for the moore - read states ) , we briefly comment on bosonic states in subsection [ sec_bosonic ] .",
    "the entanglement entropy , being a _ bipartite _ measure of entanglement , depends on the particular partitions being considered .",
    "obviously , a many - particle system can be partitioned in many ways . rather than asking",
    "which partition is the `` correct '' one , we find it more useful to ask what information one can extract from various kinds of partitioning .",
    "accordingly , we have partitioned both the spatial degrees of freedom , and the particles themselves .",
    "we find that both schemes are useful , for revealing distinct features of the many - particle state .",
    "the kinds of partitioning one is able to study depend on the available degrees of freedom .",
    "our calculations are all performed for fqh states in a spherical geometry .",
    "@xcite in this representation the fermions are placed on a sphere containing a magnetic monopole .",
    "the magnetic orbitals of the relevant landau level are then represented as angular momentum orbitals ; the total angular momentum is half the number of flux quanta , @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 orbitals are labeled either @xmath23 to @xmath24 or @xmath25 to @xmath26 . for @xmath27 particles at fractional filling @xmath13",
    ", one finds the interesting fqh states for @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a finite - size shift .",
    "the laughlin states appear at @xmath30 while for the moore - read states @xmath31 .",
    "the `` filling '' acquires the usual meaning @xmath32 only in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the orbitals are each localized around a `` circle of latitude '' on the sphere , with the @xmath23 orbital localized near one `` pole . '' since the fqh wavefunctions on a sphere",
    "are obtained in terms of orbital occupancies , one can either partition orbitals or partition particles . because of the spatial arrangement of the orbitals , partitioning orbitals is in fact equivalent to partitioning spatial regions .",
    "the difference between spatial and particle partitioning has not been stressed in the literature because the most common systems studied ( in the context of entanglement entropies in many - particle states ) are spin models , for which there is no such distinction . in the cases of itinerant particles where there is a difference , the common default scheme has been spatial partitioning .",
    "in particular , conformal field theory results on entanglement scaling @xcite and the distinction between gapless and gapped states observed in entanglement scaling @xcite actually pertain to the blocking of _ space _ rather than the particles or spins themselves .",
    "the definition of the topological entropy for two - dimensional topologically ordered states is also based on the entanglement entropy between spatial blocks .",
    "@xcite    in previous work , @xcite three of the present authors studied the entanglement entropy between subsets of particles making up a laughlin fqh state .",
    "we presented upper bounds and gave an interpretation in terms of exclusion statistics . in this paper",
    "we extend these results to the moore - read states , where the exclusion effects are more intricate .",
    "we refer to refs .   for other studies of particle entanglement properties .    for orbital or spatial partitioning ,",
    "we define block @xmath2 to be the first @xmath33 orbitals , extending spatially from one pole of the sphere out to some latitude . in the thermodynamic limit , this is equivalent to choosing a disk - shaped block @xmath2 within an infinite planar system . in this limit , since each orbital @xmath34 is associated with a wavefunction of the form @xmath35 in usual complex coordinate language , a disk with @xmath33 orbitals has radius @xmath36 .",
    "the spatial arrangement of the orbitals constrains us to either disc or ring - shaped spatial regions as the @xmath2 partition .",
    "since the orbital indexes do not give us access to the full two - dimensional degrees of freedom , it is not possible to experiment with the various kinds of topologically nontrivial partitions suggested by preskill and kitaev , @xcite levin and wen , @xcite and furukawa and misguich .",
    "@xcite however , as we have reported previously , @xcite the spherical geometry is sufficient to probe the topological entropy of fqh wavefunctions .    comparing particle and spatial entanglement entropies",
    ", we remark that the effect of correlations is opposite between the two cases . for particle",
    "partitioning , the maximal entropy is realized for uncorrelated fermions ; correlations tend to lower @xmath37 from the fermion bound @xmath38 .",
    "spatial entanglement , on the other hand , is entirely due to correlations .",
    "the point is illustrated by considering the @xmath39 laughlin state , where the fermions are uncorrelated . here",
    "the particle entanglement entropy equals @xmath38 , while the spatial entanglement entropy vanishes .",
    "in this section we provide close upper bounds to the entropy of entanglement between @xmath40 particles of the state and the remaining @xmath41 particles .",
    "we also discuss the @xmath40-particle reduced density matrices @xmath17 that arise in this context .      for fqh states on a sphere ,",
    "the @xmath40-particle reduced density matrices @xmath17 commute with the total angular momentum operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the selected @xmath40 particles .",
    "this implies that the eigenvalues of @xmath17 are organized in a multiplet structure of the corresponding @xmath44 algebra : an eigenvalue for total angular momentum @xmath45 will be @xmath46-fold degenerate .    for @xmath47 fermions , each having angular momentum @xmath48 ,",
    "the 2-particle states have total angular momenta @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , for @xmath48 integer ( half - integer ) , giving a total number of @xmath53 states . a naive upper bound to the entanglement entropy",

    "the reason is that the correlations in the laughlin states are such that particles can not come too close together .",
    "for example , if a first fermion occupies the @xmath23 orbital , localized near the north pole , the laughlin wavefunction has zero amplitude for finding a second fermion in orbitals @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath51 , @xmath59 .",
    "the highest possible value of the angular momentum of the two fermions combined is thus @xmath60 .",

    "we give a general derivation for both the laughlin and the moore - read series of fermionic fqh states .      for @xmath27 fermionic particles , @xmath40 particles in the @xmath2 block , and the total number of orbitals given by @xmath66 ,",
    "fermionic statistics lead to an obvious upper limit @xmath67 to the entropy @xmath37 @xmath68 in the fqh states the correlations are such that the particles avoid each other and the entropy is further reduced . to obtain a handle on this , one may reason as follows .",
    "the model fqh states in the laughlin and moore - read series can be characterized as zero - energy eigenstates of a hamiltonian penalizing pairs and/or triplets of particles coming to the same position . after tracing out the coordinates for the @xmath3 set ,",
    "the dependence on those in the @xmath2 set is such that one still has a zero - energy eigenstate .",
    "however , the number of orbitals available to the @xmath2 particles is larger than what is needed to make the model fqh state in the @xmath2 sector , and one instead has a certain number of quasi - holes on top of the @xmath2 set model state .",
    "the total ground state degeneracy for this situation has been studied in the literature : see ref .   for the laughlin and moore - read states and ref .   for the read - rezayi and ardonne - schoutens series of non - abelian fqh states .    for",
    "the laughlin states the details are as follows .",
    "the @xmath27-particle laughlin state is realized on a total of @xmath69 landau orbitals , corresponding to @xmath70 flux quanta .",
    "the laughlin state for @xmath40 particles would need @xmath71 flux quanta ; we thus have an excess flux of @xmath72 . with the laughlin gauge argument this corresponds to the presence of @xmath73 quasi - holes over the groundstate .",
    "according to ref .",
    "each of the quasi - holes has a number of @xmath74 effective orbitals to choose from , with bosonic counting rules ( meaning that two or more quasi - holes can be in the same effective orbital ) .",

    "details for some examples have been provided in refs .  .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath10 moore - read state , there are six sectors ( two each of quasiparticles denoted by @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) which contribute @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , leading to @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the non - abelian nature shows up in the fact that @xmath0 is larger than @xmath172 , six being the degeneracy of the @xmath10 moore - read state on the torus . + a compact general expression for the total quantum dimension for a read - rezayi state with order-@xmath98 clustering and at filling fraction @xmath173 is ( see also ref .  ) @xmath174= \\frac{\\sqrt{(k+2)(km+2)}}{2 \\sin(\\pi /(k+2 ) ) } \\ . \\label{scriptdrr}\\ ] ] it includes the laughlin states ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) and the moore - read states ( @xmath177 , @xmath178 ) as special cases . for a general spin - singlet non - abelian fqh state with order @xmath98 clustering and filling fraction @xmath179 ,",
    "the result is @xmath180= \\frac{(k+3)\\sqrt{(2km+3)}}{16 \\cos(\\pi/(k+3 ) ) \\sin^3(\\pi /(k+3 ) ) } \\ , \\label{scriptdas}\\ ] ] giving @xmath181 for the paired spin - singlet state ( @xmath177 , @xmath182 ) at @xmath183 .",
    "in general , the @xmath184-dependence of these expressions for total quantum dimensions is linked to the ground state degeneracy in torus geometry .",
    "denoting the latter by @xmath185 $ ] we have the relation @xmath186= \\mathcal{d}[k,0 ] \\sqrt{\\frac{\\#[k , m]}{\\#[k,0 ] } } \\ , \\ ] ] the conformal field theories underlying the states at @xmath187 are of wess - zumino - witten type ( @xmath188 for the rr states and @xmath189 for the as series ) and the quantities @xmath190 $ ] can be expressed in the modular @xmath29-matrix for these wzw models .",
    "first of all , we note that , since our degrees of freedom are ordered essentially one - dimensionally , we can not use one of the two - dimensional schemes proposed previously @xcite in which an appropriate addition / subtraction of the entanglement entropies of several regions cancels the boundary parts of the entropy ( @xmath191 ) leaving the subleading term @xmath0 . with the orbital degrees of freedom on a sphere , we can choose only regions corresponding to disks , concentric rings , and combinations thereof .",
    "any combination of entropies of disk- and ring - like regions that cancels out the boundary terms also unfortunately cancels out the @xmath0 term .",
    "we are thus led to using directly the scaling law , @xmath192 .",
    "our choice of block @xmath2 as the first @xmath33 orbitals , extending spatially from one pole out to some latitude , corresponds to a disk - shaped block only in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the block area is proportional to the square of @xmath193 while its boundary is proportional to @xmath194 ; these are equivalent only in the same @xmath195 limit . one way to numerically access",
    "the thermodynamic limit is to take the entanglement entropy of @xmath33 orbitals with the rest , for accessible wavefunctions of various sizes @xmath27 , and then take the @xmath195 limit .",
    "the @xmath196 versus @xmath193 points thus obtained should then follow a linear curve at large @xmath33 , whose vertical intercept gives the topological entropy .",
    "results following this procedure were provided for the @xmath197 laughlin state in our earlier paper ; @xcite here we will focus on the moore - read state .",
    "the extrapolation of @xmath198 values to the thermodynamic limit is a tricky issue .",
    "we therefore discuss the extrapolation in some detail here , providing some general results .",
    "we are interested in the function @xmath199 , where @xmath200 .",
    "we have access to @xmath201 at several integer values of @xmath27 , and would like to estimate @xmath202 . for each dataset that we have access to ( each @xmath33 ; both laughlin and moore - read ) , we note the following : the @xmath201 versus @xmath203 values form a _ monotonic _ curve and this curve gets flatter ( slope magnitude decreases ) with decreasing @xmath204 .",
    "two examples can be seen in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig_extrapolatn ] . in other words ,",
    "the first and second derivatives of the @xmath199 function have the same sign and neither derivative changes sign .    motivated by the above observations , we provide the following result . assuming only that the signs of the first two derivatives of the @xmath199 function are the same and that the signs remain unchanged until @xmath205",
    ", we have :    1 .",
    "the value @xmath206 corresponding to the smallest value @xmath207 of the available @xmath203 is a strict lower ( upper ) bound for @xmath202 if the @xmath208 is negative ( positive ) .",
    "the intercept found by connecting the @xmath199 corresponding to the smallest two @xmath203 values ( @xmath207 , @xmath209 ) , namely @xmath210 is a strict upper ( lower ) bound if @xmath208 is negative ( positive ) and @xmath211 is positive ( negative ) .",
    "the limits @xmath212 and @xmath213 thus obtained give us conservative bounds for the required entanglement entropies in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath196 . to obtain a sharper extrapolation",
    ", one can use various polynomial extrapolations and take the average , as done in our earlier work .",
    "@xcite here , we improve the extrapolation by using the extrapolation algorithm of bulirsh and stoer ( bst algorithm ) , based on rational polynomial fraction approximations .",

    ", @xmath214 has been tuned to ensure that the sets obtained after first and second iterations converge to the same value , i.e. , the lowest elements of the second and third columns are the same . [",

    "it is therefore important to avoid values from these parts of the table .",
