    "sirius - like binaries contain a main sequence or evolved star ( spectral type k or earlier ) and a non - interacting white dwarf secondary . until recently only a handful of such systems were known , such as the prototype sirius , where the white dwarf sirius  b ( 1.03 , holberg et  al .",
    "1998 ) is in a wide visual orbit about the a0v star sirius  a ( p@xmath3  years ) .",
    "since then , through the _ rosat _ wide field camera ( wfc ) and the extreme ultraviolet explorer ( _ euve _ ) all sky surveys of the early 1990 s , more than 20 new sirius - like systems have been discovered , with primaries as massive as spectral type b ( barstow et  al .",

    "if the two components can be resolved and an astrometric mass determined for the degenerate star , these systems can potentially be used to investigate the theoretical white dwarf mass - radius relation , for which few data points currently exist ( vauclair et  al .",
    "1997 , provencal et  al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the first new sirius - like system discovered by _",
    "rosat _ was ( hd97277 @xmath4 hr4343 , a1iii@xmath5wd , v@xmath6 , fleming et  al . 1991 ) .",
    "unfortunately , published estimates of the effective temperature ( ) , surface gravity ( log @xmath7 ) and mass ( @xmath8 ) of the white dwarf in this system are poorly constrained . since it is unobservable at optical wavelengths , due to the overwhelming brightness of the a1iii companion , we can not establish these parameters by the usual method of fitting a grid of model atmospheres to the optical h balmer absorption line series .",
    "an unambiguous determination of and log @xmath7 ( and , hence , @xmath8 ) requires three or more spectral lines , but existing _ iue _ far - uv spectra of the white dwarf only cover the h lyman  @xmath9 absorption line at 1216 . from a careful analysis of this line s profile , barstow et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) and vct98 could only constrain the white dwarf s gravity log @xmath7 to be @xmath10 . assuming",
    "both the white dwarf and the a1 giant lie at the _ hipparcos _ distance estimate of @xmath11  pc , vct98 could further constrain the gravity log @xmath7 to be @xmath12 .",
    "this would imply the white dwarf has an unusually low mass , @xmath13 , too low for it to have evolved in isolation ( e.g. ,  marsh , dhillon & duck 1995 ) .",
    "the progenitor of such a low mass degenerate must at some stage have interacted with another star , during which it lost mass and thus its evolution was accelerated .",
    "for example , the progenitor could lose its outer envelope without having reached the asymptotic giant branch or ever having ignited helium in its core ( which requires a core mass of @xmath14 ) .",
    "nelemans & tauris ( 1998 ) even speculate that such low mass degenerates might form when a solar - like star ascends the giant branch and captures a nearby giant planet ( e.g.  hd89707 ) .",
    "the subsequent spiral - in phase expels the giant s envelope leaving a low mass helium - core white dwarf remnant .",
    "before we speculate on the possible origins of a low mass white dwarf in the system , we need to be certain that the degenerate star and the a1 giant are actually physically related and do not merely form a chance alignment .",
    "if the white dwarf s gravity was in reality nearer log @xmath15 , then it would lie in front of the a giant and have a mass nearer the mean for such objects , @xmath16 . in that case",
    ", there would be no need to invoke binary evolution to explain its existence .    the advent of far - uv spectroscopy from 900 to 1200 with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) satellite , covering the entire h lyman series , now provides us with a first opportunity to determine precisely the fundamental parameters of the white dwarf , . in this paper",
    "we show that it does indeed have an unusually low mass , and has almost certainly evolved through binary interaction .",
    "_ fuse _ was launched from cape canaveral on 1999 june 24 , and is designed to make high resolution spectroscopic observations in the far - uv regime ( 905@xmath171187 ) , in particular covering the h lyman series from ly@xmath18 at 1026 to the lyman limit at 912 .",
    "the instrument consists of four co - aligned prime focus telescopes and rowland spectrographs with microchannel plate detectors .",
    "two of the telescope channels use : coatings for optimum reflectivity between 1000@xmath171087 , and the other two channels use coatings for optimized throughput between 905@xmath171105 .",
    "each channel is further subdivided into two non - continuous segments ( they are split by a few angstrms ) . for a detailed overview of the _ fuse _ mission and instruments ,",
    "see moos et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) .    was observed by _ fuse _ for a total of 8037  s on 2000 may 29 .",
    "two separate exposures were made , each of 4018.55  s. at that stage of the mission , _ fuse _ was experiencing unexpectedly large changes in the alignment of the optics during each orbit due to thermal motion .",
    "in particular , small rotations in the mirror made it difficult to keep the four independent optical paths within the instrument co - aligned , sometimes resulting in misalignments large enough for targets to drift out of the aperture in one or more channels ( for a full discussion of the on - orbit performance of _ fuse _ , see sahnow et  al .",
    "the observations were therefore made using the low - resolution aperture ( lwrs : @xmath19 ) in order to minimise these problems , but none - the - less the flux calibration and wavelength calibration of different segments of the spectrum were not originally altogether satisfactory .",
    "re - extraction of the data with version 1.8.7 of the calfuse pipeline , released to the community in late-2000 , resulted in a marked improvement in the flux calibration for each segment , although small differences were still noticeable .",
    "consequently , we have scaled the flux level of each extracted segment to that of the  1a segment , since the  1 channel is used for guiding and is therefore controlled . even after re - extraction and re - calibration with the most recently available wavelength calibration files , differences in the wavelength calibration of different segments of the spectrum were clearly noticable .",
    "again , each extracted segment was therefore shifted with respect to the calibration for the  1 channel .",
    "even so , the absolute wavelength calibration for  1 is not necessarily reliable , and thus any line velocities should be treated with caution .",
    "the two exposures for each segment were co - added , and then each segment was merged to form one continuous spectrum .",
    "regions of low signal / noise and/or poorly calibrated data were rejected at this stage .",
    "the merged spectra were then re - binned to 0.1 for the purpose of fitting the h lyman lines to determine the star s temperature and gravity , although the measured resolution is somewhat better , r@xmath2018000@xmath1724000 depending on the wavelength region .",

    "continuum flux from the white dwarf was detected in both the short wavelength ( sw , 70@xmath17190 ) and medium wavlength ( mw , 140@xmath17350 ) spectrometers .",
    "note that the a1iii primary contributes no flux at these wavelengths .",
    "we have extracted these data from the _ euve _ go - processed event data using standard proceedures .",
    "our reduction techinques are described in more detail in earlier work ( e.g.  barstow et  al .",
    "we have matched the _ fuse _ spectrum with a grid of non - lte model atmospheres , assuming a pure - h composition , calculated using the code ( e.g. ,  lanz & hubeny 1995 ) .",
    "the grid spans 20,000k to 100,000k in and 6.5 to 9.75 in log @xmath7 .",
    "we fitted five h lyman absorption lines shortwards of and including ly@xmath22 , and the continuum redward from ly@xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "geocoronal emission lines in the cores of ly@xmath22 and ly@xmath24 were ignored in the fit , as were regions around narrow ism absorption lines such as oi at 1039.2 and 988.7 .",
    "a model was included in the fit to account for the narrow hi ism absorption lines seen in the core of each h photospheric line .",
    "although this is necessary in order to correctly model the broad photospheric absorption lines , the hi ism absorption lines are saturated and can not be used to determine the column density .",
    "instead , we have estimated the hi column density to from the _ euve _ spectrum , see below .",
    "a best fit model was found by fitting our combination of photospheric and ism models within the program , in a similar manner to fitting the h balmer series in optical spectra ( e.g. ,  marsh et  al .",
    "we find the best fit parameters to be @xmath25  k ( formal 1@xmath26 errors 35,810  k@xmath1735,940  k ) and log @xmath7 @xmath47.198 ( 7.190@xmath177.209 ) .",
    "the model fit is shown in figure 1 .",
    "confidence contours for this fit are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we note that slight variations on this fitting ( e.g.  adding or ignoring a few extra data points at the short wavelength end ) can produce slightly different results with very similar reduced chi - squared values ( @xmath27 ) , but that the best fit parameters always lie within the ranges 35,750k@xmath28@xmath2835,950k and 7.17@xmath28log @xmath7@xmath287.21 .",
    "inclusion of higher order h lines results in much poorer fits ( @xmath29 ) , although the surface gravity is slightly reduced as a consequence .",
    "this is not altogether surprising since the higher order lines are more contaminated by ism absorption than the stronger , lower order lines . on the other hand ,",
    "inclusion of the continuum longwards of ly@xmath22 is important , since this includes some of the redward wing of this line and the measured gravity is found to be higher by @xmath300.05  dex without these data . extending the best fit model into the optical region , we estimate the white dwarf s magnitude at v@xmath31 . of course",
    ", this is dependent on the error on the _ fuse _ flux calibration , which we have assumed to be @xmath32 ( note that the likely error on the flux calibration is much greater than the formal errors on the best fit and log @xmath7 ) .",
    "if v@xmath413.2 , we estimate the absolute magnitude m@xmath33@xmath34 and d@xmath4101  pc , compared to the _ hipparcos _ distance estimate to the primary of 77@xmath1787  pc .",

    "the white dwarf temperature and gravity were fixed within the 90% limits determined from fitting the _ fuse _ data , and the @xmath35 and @xmath36 ism ratios were fixed according to the mean ionisation fractions in the local ism determined by barstow et  al .",
    "unfortunately , a good fit could not be satisfactorily obtained .",
    "the pure - h model predicts a factor @xmath37 more flux below @xmath38 than is seen in the _ euve _ data .",

    "for example , in 1990 january they measured the velocity at @xmath68  km  s@xmath64 , but a year later ( 1991 march ) it had apparantly dropped to @xmath69  km  s@xmath64 . by 1993",
    "march the radial velocity was back at @xmath70  km  s@xmath64 .",
    "if all of these measurements and their errors are believed , and duemmler et  al . in particular carefully consider the errors in their data , then it is plausible that the radial velocity is slowly varying between observations taken a few years apart .    on the other hand , vct98 monitored for over 15 months from 1995 december to 1997 march , covering the period between the smalley et  al . and duemmler et  al .",

    "we conclude that the system is not a close binary , unless the system is being viewed at a very unfavourable geometry ( i.e.  face - on ) .",
    "further , it is plausible that the period is of order years , and that it may be as high as @xmath1  years .",
    "low mass ( @xmath75 ) , helium - core white dwarfs can not be made by standard single star evolution since the main sequence lifetime of their progenitor stars is longer than the hubble time .",
    "the usual scenario for making such white dwarfs involves a phase of mass transfer between stars in a binary system . in this picture",
    "the expansion of the white dwarf progenitor , as it evolves up the giant branch , causes it to fill its roche lobe while the core mass remains low .",
    "mass transfer to the secondary star ( in this case @xmath76  crt  a ) then exposes the low mass , helium core .",
    "the system could , therefore , be a long - sought remnant of algol - type evolution . in an algol - type binary",
    ", a cool f - kiii - iv secondary star fills its roche lobe and transfers mass to a hot b - av primary .",
    "these systems were a puzzle to astronomers because the less massive secondary is more evolved than its companion .",
    "this paradox was resolved when it was realised that the current secondary was originally the more massive star , and that the current configuration of the binary was the result of extensive mass transfer , resulting in a reversal of the mass ratio of the system .",
    "a remnant of such an algol - type binary would then consist of an early - type intermediate - mass star with a low mass white dwarf companion .",
    "although algols are the most numerous of known eclipsing binaries , their post - mass transfer counterparts have eluded discovery because the white dwarfs are overwhelmed at optical wavelengths by their bright companions .",
    "could be the first confirmed post - algol system .",
    "if is indeed a remnant algol - type binary , we would expect the orbital period to be @xmath77  tens of days .",
    "of course , as discussed above , the period is currently unknown .",
    "it is possible that the system appears face - on to us , so that it shows little or no radial velocity variations , even if the period was short .",
    "if , on the other hand , the period is @xmath78years , then this would start to cause problems for standard models of binary evolution .      as discussed in section  4.4 above , there is evidence to suggest that the orbital period is in fact relatively long , perhaps as high as @xmath1  years .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to explain the existence of such a system with standard binary evolution models .",
    "for example , the roche lobe radius of the white dwarf progenitor in , say , a 7  year orbit is @xmath79 . the only stars with radii this large have masses of @xmath80 , and are on the giant branch with helium core masses much larger than @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , the largest radius at which a star of any mass has a helium core of @xmath81 is about @xmath82 , for a @xmath83 star almost at the tip of the giant branch ( webbink 1985 ) .",
    "more massive stars create helium cores of @xmath81 much earlier in their evolution , and hence at smaller radii .",
    "stars with masses greater than about @xmath84 reach core masses of @xmath81 on the main sequence",
    ". therefore , it seems clear that the white dwarf progenitor must have been less massive than @xmath84 .",
    "however , the large roche radius of this progenitor star leaves the standard scenario facing a number of severe difficulties in explaining the existence of a low mass white dwarf in a system with an orbital period as high as @xmath1  years .",
    "nuclear - driven , conservative , stable mass transfer from the white dwarf progenitor to the secondary while the progenitor was on the giant branch could increase the orbital period of the system ( webbink , rappaport & savonije 1983 ; ritter 1999 ) , but it is not possible to increase the orbital period beyond @xmath85  years for a helium - core white dwarf of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the possible @xmath1 year orbital period of , or indeed any orbital period significantly longer than @xmath85  years , remains a puzzle in the context of conventional models of binary evolution .",
    "we now consider a number of other evolutionary possibilities .",
    "+ ( a ) _ unstable mass transfer .",
    "_ if the initial binary system had an extreme mass ratio , or if the white dwarf progenitor had a deep convective envelope when mass transfer was initiated , the mass transfer could have become unstable and occur on the thermal or dynamical timescale of the mass donor . under these circumstances ,",
    "the analytic and semi - analytic models break down , and it is difficult to determine the outcome of such a situation .",
    "it is possible that the white dwarf progenitor could be driven far out of equilibrium , allowing it to continue to fill its roche lobe as the mass ratio reverses and the orbit expands to the observed period .",
    "calculations of thermal timescale mass transfer ( schenker 2001 ) , in which the donor star is out of thermal equilibrium , suggest that the system behaves differently for a short time .",
    "however , it returns to a stable mass transfer configuration on the giant branch reasonably quickly . on the other hand , dynamical instability of the donor star",
    "is usually assumed to lead to common envelope ( ce ) evolution .",
    "while ce evolution is a viable mechanism for the production of low mass white dwarfs it is also associated with a decrease in the orbital period , as the orbital angular momentum is reduced in driving off the envelope .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is unlikely that a period of unstable mass transfer or non - equilibrium evolution of the white dwarf progenitor alone could produce the low mass white dwarf in .",
    "+ ( b ) _ period evolution after mass transfer ceases . _",
    "a long period system could be explained by allowing the orbital period to increase after the white dwarf has been formed .",
    "in general , a binary system can increase its period if mass is lost from the system with a relatively low specific angular momentum .",
    "the obvious physical example of such mass loss would be the presence of an intense stellar wind from one or both of the stars in .",
    "however the mass loss would have to be extreme : we could envisage a system in which was initially much more massive .",
    "some b stars are known to have significant winds , and the mass lost through such a wind could be lost from the binary system .",
    "the observed mass loss rates for b stars ( @xmath87  @xmath88 yr@xmath64 , lamers 1981 ) are such that it would take @xmath89 years to turn a @xmath90 b star into a @xmath91 a star .",
    "even if this extreme mass reduction was allowed within the main sequence life of such a star the cooling age of the white dwarf is only @xmath53 years , an order of magnitude shorter than the required mass loss timescale .",
    "so it would seem that the large magnitude of the period increase and the short timescale on which it needs to act combine to make the period increase solution very unlikely .",
    "+ ( c ) _ a multiple system .",
    "_ it is possible that is in fact a triple system , with orbiting a short period binary containing the white dwarf and another star . in this case",
    "the evolution of the shorter period binary system resulted in the creation of the low mass white dwarf .",
    "the progenitor of the white dwarf must have been more massive than , which is assumed to be unaffected by the evolution of the smaller binary system .",
    "hence the age of the system is set by the age of the a1 giant .",
    "in addition , the white dwarf has a cooling age of @xmath92 years , which means that the progenitor has to be only slightly more massive than a1iii .",
    "since the companion to the white dwarf is currently unseen , its mass must be less than @xmath93 . in order to produce a white dwarf mass of @xmath81",
    ", a @xmath94 star must have filled its roche lobe with a radius of about @xmath95 cm . from these constraints on the masses of the two binary components and the roche lobe radius ,",
    "we calculate that such a system would have an orbital period of about 6 hours",
    ". it would be interesting to measure the radial velocity of the white dwarf itself to see if it varies between the two _ fuse _ exposures , but the lack of any narrow heavy element lines , the infilling of the h lines with geocoronal emission and/or interstellar absorption , and the poor wavelength calibration precludes any such measurement with these data .",
    "+ ( d ) _ an eccentric binary system . _",
    "another possibility involves an eccentric binary system , in which mass transfer from the primary occurred in bursts at periastron .",
    "if the binary system had an eccentricity of @xmath96 and a period @xmath1  years , then the roche lobe radius of at periastron is consistent with the radius of a giant that has a core mass of @xmath81 .",
    "hence it is possible that the system was formed from a binary system consisting of two stars of similar mass ( @xmath97 ) in a wide , eccentric orbit .",
    "the more massive of these stars began evolving up the giant branch .",
    "only when its core mass was greater than about @xmath98 did the star fill its roche lobe and begin transferring mass ( conservatively ) to the lower mass star . since the system had an eccentric orbit , mass transfer only occurred at periastron .",
    "this changed the eccentricity of the orbit ( matese & whitmore 1983 ) , but clearly the final system must have had parameters which meant that the roche lobe radius was @xmath99 and the orbital period was of @xmath1 years .",
    "_ fuse _ spectroscopy of the hot white dwarf companion to shows that it has an unusually low mass ( @xmath0 ) and has almost certainly evolved through binary interaction .",
    "thus , the system could be a long - sought remnant of algol - type evolution .",
    "however , radial velocity measurements appear to indicate that the pair are not close . if the velocity is essentially static then we could of course be viewing the system at an unfavourable geometry ( i.e.  face - on ) .",
    "alternatively , the binary is relatively wide . if the variations between radial velocity measurements made by grenier et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) in the early 1990s , smalley et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) in 1994/95 , and duemmler et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) in 1997 may are believed , then the period could be of order years .",
    "failure to resolve the pair with hst / wfpc2 places an upper limit on the period of @xmath100  years , assuming a favourable geometry .",
    "perhaps more importantly , micro - variations in s proper motion as measured by _ hipparcos _ suggest a binary period @xmath1  years .",
    "but any binary period @xmath2  years poses a problem for standard models of binary interaction .",
    "the most likely evolutionary history of the @xmath76  crt system which could result in a low mass white dwarf in a @xmath1 year orbit with an a1 giant is one which involves either a multiple system or an eccentric binary orbit .",
