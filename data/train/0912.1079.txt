    "the last ten years have witnessed an intense activity in single - molecule force spectroscopy experiments in detecting inter and intramolecular forces of biological systems to understand their functions and structures .",
    "much of the research has been focused on elastic properties of proteins , dna , and rna , i.e , their response to an external force , following the seminal papers by rief _",
    "@xcite , and tskhovrebova _ et al .",
    "the main advantage of this technique is its ability to separate out the fluctuations of individual trajectories from the ensemble average behavior observed in traditional bulk biochemical experiments .",
    "this allows for studying unfolding pathways in detail using the end - to - end distance as a reaction coordinate .",
    "moreover , the single - molecule force spectroscopy can be used to decipher the unfolding free energy landscape ( fel ) of biomolecules @xcite .    as cytoskeletal proteins , large actin - binding proteins play a key roles in cell organization , mechanics and signalling@xcite . during the process of permanent cytoskeleton reorganization , all involved participants are subject to mechanical stress .",
    "one of them is the fourth domain _ distyostelium discoideum _ filamin ( ddfln4 ) , which binds different components of actin - binding protein .",
    "therefore , understanding the mechanical response of this domain to a stretched force is of great interest . recently , using the afm experiments , schwaiger _",
    "@xcite have obtained two major results for ddfln4 .",
    "first , this domain ( fig .",
    "[ native_ddfln4_strands_fig ] ) unfolds via intermediates as the force - extension curve displays two peaks centered at the end - to - end extension @xmath1 nm and @xmath2 nm .",
    "second , with the help of loop mutations , it was suggested that during the first unfolding event ( first peak ) strands a and b unfold first .",
    "therefore , strands c - g form a stable intermediate structure , which then unfolds in the second unfolding event ( second peak ) . in addition , schwaiger _",
    "_ @xcite have also determined the fel parameters of ddfln4 .    with the help of the c@xmath0-go model @xcite , li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated that the mechanical unfolding of ddfln4 does follow the three - state scenario but the full agreement between theory and experiments was not obtained .",
    "the simulations @xcite showed that two peaks in the force - extension profile occur at @xmath3 nm and 11 nm , i.e. , the go modeling does not detect the peak at @xmath2 nm .",
    "instead , it predicts the existence of a peak not far from the native conformation .",
    "more importantly , theoretical unfolding pathways @xcite are very different from the experimental ones @xcite : the unfolding initiates from the c - terminal , but not from the n - terminal terminal as shown by the experiments .",
    "it should be noted that the pulling speed used in the previous simulations is about five orders of magnitude larger than the experimental value @xcite .",
    "therefore , a natural question emerges is if the discrepancy between theory and experiments is due to huge difference in pulling speeds .",
    "motivated by this , we have carried low-@xmath4 simulations , using the go model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we uncovered that unfolding pathways of ddfln4 depend on the pulling speed and only at @xmath5 nm / s , the theoretical unfolding sequencing coincides with the experimental one @xcite .",
    "however , even at low loading rates , the existence of the peak at @xmath3 nm remains robust and the go modeling does not capture the maximum at @xmath2 nm .    in the previous work @xcite ,",
    "using dependencies of unfolding times on external forces , the distance between the native state ( ns ) and intermediate state ( is ) @xmath6 , and the distance between the is and denaturated state ( ds ) @xmath7 of ddfln4 have been estimated . in the bell approximation ,",
    "the agreement between the theory and experiments @xcite was reasonable .",
    "however , in the non - bell approximation @xcite , the theoretical values of @xmath6 , and @xmath7 seem to be high @xcite . in addition",
    "the unfolding barrier between the first transition state ( ts1 ) and ns @xmath8 is clearly higher than its experimental counterpart ( table 1 ) .    in this paper , assuming that the microscopic kinetic theory @xcite holds for a three - state protein , we calculated @xmath9 and unfolding barriers by a different method which is based on dependencies of peaks in the force - extension curve on @xmath4 .",
    "our present estimations for the unfolding fel parameters are more reasonable compared to the previous ones @xcite .",
    "finally , we have also studied thermal unfolding pathways of ddfln4 and shown that the mechanical unfolding pathways are different from the thermal ones .",
    "the native conformation of ddfln4 , which has seven @xmath10-strands , enumerated as a to g , was taken from the pdb ( pi : 1ksr , fig . [",

    "we assume that residues @xmath11 and @xmath12 are in native contact if the distance between them in the native conformation , is shorter than a cutoff distance @xmath13  . with this choice of @xmath14 ,",
    "the molecule has 163 native contacts .",

    "neglecting the inertia term , the brownian dynamics equation was numerically solved by the simple euler method . due to the large viscosity",
    ", we can choose a large time step @xmath38 , and this choice allows us to study unfolding at low loading rates .    in the constant velocity force simulations , we fix the n - terminal and pull the c - terminal by applying the force @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the displacement of the pulled atom from its original position @xcite , and the spring constant of cantilever @xmath41",
    "is set to be the same as the spring constant of the go model .",
    "the pulling direction was chosen along the vector drawn from the fixed atom to the pulled one .",
    "the mechanical unfolding sequencing was studied by monitoring the fraction of native contacts of the @xmath10-strands and of their seven pairs as a function of @xmath42 , which is admitted a good reaction coordinate . in order to probe thermal unfolding pathways , for the @xmath11-th trajectory we introduce the progress variable @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the unfolding time @xcite .",

    "in our previous high pulling speed ( @xmath47 nm / s ) simulations @xcite , the force - extension curve shows two peaks at @xmath3 nm and 10 nm , while the experiments showed that peaks appear at @xmath1 nm and 22 nm .",

    "we do not exclude a possibility that such a peak was overlooked by experiments , as it happened with the titin domain i27 .",
    "recall that , for this domain the first afm experiment @xcite did not trace the hump which was observed in the later simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite .",

    "since the experiments @xcite showed that intermediate structures contain five ordered strands c - g , intermediates predicted by simulations are more ordered than the experimental ones .",
    "even though , our low loading rate go simulations provide the same pathways as on the experiments .",
    "the difference between theory and experiments in intermediate structures comes from different locations of the first peak .",
    "it remains unclear if this is a shortcoming of go models or of the experiments because it is hard to imagine that a @xmath10-protein like ddfln4 displays the first peak at such a large extension @xmath1 nm @xcite .",

    "[ reentrance_fg_fig]d .",
    "the dependence of unfolding pathways on @xmath4 is understandable .",
    "if a protein is pulled very fast , the perturbation , caused by the external force , does not have enough time to propagate to the fixed n - terminal before the c - terminal unfolds .",

    "the present value of @xmath6 agrees with the experiments better than the old one @xcite . presumably , this is because it has been estimated by the same procedure as in the experiments @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the logarithmic behavior is observed only at low enough @xmath4 . at high loading rates ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath4 becomes power - law .",
    "this explains why all - atom simulations , performed at @xmath82 nm / s for most of proteins , are not able to provide reasonable estimations for @xmath74 .",
