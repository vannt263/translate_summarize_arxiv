    "extensive evidence for departures from the temperature - dependencies characteristic of fermi - liquid ( fl ) behavior in the thermodynamic properties of @xmath11- and @xmath12-metals has been collected over the last fifteen years.@xcite a key observation is that both the sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath13 , and the pauli susceptibility @xmath14 increase with decreasing temperature and show no sign of entering a @xmath9-independent fl regime down to the lowest achievable temperatures .",

    "the @xmath136 lmr scaling directly follows from ( 1 ) a field - independent slope in @xmath83 , ( 2 ) a negligible residual resistivity at @xmath135 , and ( 3 ) @xmath137 at higher fields . the increasingly negative @xmath31-dependent residual resistivity evident from  1.5 k to 8 k is an indication that the resistivity must become a stronger function of @xmath9 ( @xmath138 with @xmath139 ) at lower temperatures .",
    "hence , the negative @xmath140 term in the nfl state simply reflects the fact that the magnetic field pushes the system into a fl state at much lower temperatures .",

    "this behavior is exhibited , for example , by ceru@xmath17si@xmath17 ( ref . ) , ceal@xmath16 ( ref . ) , ybni@xmath17b@xmath17c ( ref . ) , and cerhin@xmath0 ( ref . ) . in a kondo - lattice fermi - liquid the mr maximum results from the competition between a @xmath9-independent residual resistivity contribution that increases in a magnetic field , and a temperature - dependent term that decreases in a magnetic field and grows quadratically with temperature.@xcite however , for the aforementioned kondo - lattice case the location , @xmath142 , of the mr maximum moves toward lower fields with increasing @xmath9 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the difference between the low - field mr in a coherent kondo system and that of cecoin@xmath0 resides in the fact that the extrapolated residual resistivity term in cecoin@xmath0 produces a negative mr while a small positive mr results from the slight increase in the slope of @xmath83 shown in fig .",

    "second , constant - temperature @xmath145 curves shift toward lower values with increasing @xmath9 up to 6 k , and then they start to move in the opposite direction  to higher values  above 6 k. with regard to the second effect , a shallow minimum in the hall coefficient @xmath146 centered at roughly the same temperature has been seen in ab - plane transport measurements when the field exceeded 0.5 t.@xcite this temperature dependence is typical for multi - band electronic structure system in which the weighted contribution from different bands changes with temperature.@xcite the nonlinear field dependence of @xmath144 can be attributed to the kondo interactions present in the system . when an external field is applied to a hf system",

    "the band for which the field suppresses the kondo effect more efficiently will carry a larger fraction of the aggregate transport current as the field is increased .",
    "it seems quite reasonable that this mechanism can explain the observed change in the sign of the constant - temperature hall voltage with increasing field , while a subtle interplay between kondo interactions and multiple bands with different carrier - mobility @xmath9-dependencies could be responsible for the change in the lmr field dependence for @xmath147 k.      this section is devoted to an analysis of the field - induced fl behavior evident in @xmath8 data for large magnetic fields . applying a magnetic field along the c - axis",

    "if we use @xmath166 as determined from ab - plane transport@xcite and specific - heat measurements,@xcite the best - fit to the data ( the solid line in fig . [ fl ] ) gives @xmath167 tesla , putting the qcp even farther into the superconducting state .",
