    "wireless data traffic is dramatically growing and is expected to grow thousand fold in the next decade @xcite .",
    "the fifth generation of wireless networks ( 5 g ) is being designed to cope with the excessive data rate demands of future multimedia applications .",
    "there are many challenges which should be addressed in such a network .",
    "multiple access ( ma ) techniques have an essential role in improving the performance of mobile communication systems .",
    "non - orthogonal multiple access ( noma ) or power domain ma and sparse code multiple access ( scma ) techniques are promising ma techniques for 5 g which have been investigated recently .",
    "the main principle of noma approach is applying superposition coding ( sc ) in the transmitter side for assigning each sub - carrier to multiple users and successive interference cancellation ( sic ) in the receiver side to cancel the other users signals ( interference from other users sharing the same subcarrier ) . on the other hand , scma is a code book based multiple access technique where each subcarrier can be assigned to multiple users with applying an appropriate code book assignment . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied noma performance from the information theory aspect .",
    "system - level performance for noma in downlink has been investigated in @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors evaluated the throughput and outage of noma approach .",
    "scma as a ma technique has been introduced in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a resource allocation method to maximize the energy efficiency in scma - based system has been studied . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced scma as a multiple access technique which improves the spectrum efficiency . in @xcite , different noma techniques such as pattern division multiple access ( pdma ) , scma , and multi - user shared access ( musa ) are studied , and their link - level performances are compared with each other , in this paper , power domain noma is not studied , also , the considered ma methods are not investigated from resource allocation and receiver complexity perspective .",
    "features , challenges , and future research trend of the ma techniques of 5 g have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we consider two ma techniques , namely , noma and scma , which are candidates of ma techniques in 5 g .",
    "the performance of these techniques , measured based on the system sum - rate and complexity , is studied and compared to each other . * for each technique , we consider a downlink resource allocation problem in the context of heterogeneous cellular networks ( hcn ) based on which we evaluate and compare the performance of these techniques . * to solve the resource allocation problems , an iterative algorithm is devised . in noma - based system , in each iteration , power and sub - carriers are allocated separately . to solve the subcarrier allocation problem arithmetic geometric mean approximation ( agma )",
    "is applied .",
    "the power allocation problem is solved by using sca approach and applying dual method . in scma - based system , in each iteration , power and code books are allocated separately in which code book allocation is solved by agma and power allocation is solved by using sca approach and applying dual method .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ systemmodelandproblemformulation ] ,",
    "system model and problem formulation for the two ma techniques are presented . in section [ solutions ] , the iterative algorithms to obtain the solution of the optimization problems are developed . in section [ complexity ] , the implementation complexity is investigated .",
    "simulation results are presented in section [ simulations ] and the paper is concluded in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider the downlink of a hcn system with one macro base station and @xmath0 small base stations ( bss ) .",
    "total number of users is @xmath1 and the total number of available subcarriers is @xmath2 . with these definitions ,",
    "the system model and problem formulation of each ma technique is defined as follows :      in this system model , @xmath3 indicates the channel coefficient between user @xmath4 and bs @xmath5 on subcarrier @xmath6 , @xmath7 shows the transmit power of bs @xmath5 to user @xmath4 on subcarrier @xmath6 and @xmath8 is a binary variable that indicates the subcarrier allocation of user @xmath4 in bs @xmath5 , e.g. , @xmath9 if the subcarrier @xmath6 is allocated to user @xmath4 in bs @xmath5 , otherwise @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , the set of bss is shown by @xmath11 where mbs is shown by @xmath12 , the set of all users in bs @xmath5 is shown by @xmath13 which @xmath14 , and the set of all subcarriers is denoted by @xmath15 .",

    "users are sorted based on their channel gain , i.e. , @xmath22 , and for sorted users , we have @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "based on the noma approach , in the transmitter side , users signals are multiplexed in power domain by applying sc , and in the receiver side , each user removes the other user s signals by using sic approach .",
    "each user can remove the signals of the users with lower order , and considers the signals of users with higher order as noise .",
    "therefore , the sinr of user @xmath4 on sub - carrier @xmath6 in bs @xmath5 is obtained by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is obtained as @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicates the noise power of user @xmath4 on sub - carrier @xmath6 in bs @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the rate of user @xmath4 on subcarrier @xmath6 in bs @xmath5 is obtained by @xmath28 accordingly , the system sum - rate is equal to @xmath29 furthermore , we impose a total transmit power constraint for each bs in the system as @xmath30 the proposed resource allocation problem based on noma approach is formulated as :    [ eq8 ] @xmath31    where demonstrates that each subcarrier can be assigned to at most @xmath32 users simultaneously .",
    "an scma encoder is a mapping from @xmath33 bits to a @xmath2-dimensional codebook of size @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the n - dimensional codewords of a codebook are sparse vectors with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) non - zero entries , which refers to @xmath35 specific subcarriers . based on the scma approach , codebooks which are composed of subcarriers are the basic resource unit in networks @xcite , and",

    "we assume that the mapping between codebooks and subcarriers are fixed , i.e. , @xmath46 is a known parameter . in addition , notation @xmath47 shows the transmit power of bs @xmath5 to user @xmath4 on codebook @xmath40 .",

    "the resource allocation problem of noma - based system is non - convex and includes both integer and continuous variables .",
    "therefore , the available methods to solve convex optimization problem can not be applied directly . to solve this problem ,",
    "an iterative algorithm is exploited where in each iteration , the main problem is decoupled into two sub - problems : subcarrier allocation and power allocation . in each iteration ,",
    "the subcarrier allocation is solved by applying agma method . moreover ,",
    "the power allocation is computed by applying sca for low complexity ( scale ) approach .",
