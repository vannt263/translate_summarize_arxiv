    "hyperkhler manifolds have played important roles in the study of supersymmetric quantum field theories and string theories , especially , in the context of the string compactifications , duality tests and so on .",
    "the explicit metric on a compact hyperkhler manifold is not known except trivial examples . on the other hand ,",
    "explicit forms of the non - compact hyperkhler metric have been derived in several ways . among them",
    "the most systematic one is the hyperkhler quotient construction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in 4-dimensions ,",
    "the hyperkhler metrics satisfy the self - dual einstein equations and arise as the gravitational instanton solutions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these can be classified into some categories : the ale , alf , alg and alh spaces @xcite according to their asymptotic volume growth .    in the context of 3-dimensional gauge theories ,",
    "hyperkhler metrics are obtained by considering well - separated monopoles , which is due to manton s observation @xcite that the dynamics of @xmath3 well - separated bps monopoles can be approximated as a geodesic motion on the asymptotic moduli space of the bps @xmath3-monopole if the initial velocities of each monopole are substantially small . in this paper",
    "we only consider the case with the gauge group @xmath0 or @xmath4 .",
    "for a non - periodic bps @xmath3-monopole the moduli space can be written as @xmath5 , where the simply - connected part is denoted by @xmath6 , and the degrees of @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to the center of mass and the gauge degree of global @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the dimensions of the @xmath3-monopole moduli @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath10 can be identified with the moduli space of a vacuum on the coulomb branch of the three dimensional @xmath12 super yang - mills theory with eight supercharges @xcite .",
    "the relative moduli space of the 2-monopole @xmath13 is known as the atiyah - hitchin manifold @xcite which is the alf space with @xmath8 fibration over @xmath7 . in the case of well - separated bps monopoles , each monopole carries three moduli of the position and a degree of the @xmath9 phase modulus .",
    "the latter degree corresponds to the electric charge and hence we should include the electrical degree of the dyon .",
    "the effective dynamics of the @xmath3-dyon system can be described by a sigma model lagrangian whose target space is the monopole moduli space .",
    "hence the asymptotic metric of the moduli space of the bps @xmath3-monopoles can be obtained by calculating the lagrangian of interactions of @xmath3 well - separated bps monopoles ( dyons ) .",
    "the metric is known as the gibbons - manton metric @xcite . for a periodic bps @xmath3-monopole on @xmath14 , which is called the monopole chain @xcite , the moduli space is identified with the moduli space of a vacuum on the coulomb branch of the four dimensional @xmath12 super yang - mills theory compactified on @xmath8 with eight supercharges .",
    "the relative moduli space of the 2-monopole @xmath13 is the alg space @xcite .",
    "since the periodicity is achieved by a chain of monopoles , the total energy would diverge due to the infinite number of monopoles .",
    "however , the nahm transform can be make well - defined and the asymptotic metric of the moduli space of monopole chains is obtained in the same manner as the non - periodic case @xcite . the geodesic motion is also discussed @xcite .",
    ".the correspondence of the periodicity of monopole , super yang - mills theory and the asymptotic behavior of hyperkhler metric . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for a doubly - periodic bps @xmath3-monopole on @xmath15 , which is called the monopole sheet or wall @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the moduli space is identified with the moduli space of a vacuum on the coulomb branch of the five dimensional @xmath12 super yang - mills theory compactified on @xmath2 with eight supercharges @xcite .",
    "one of the examples of the correspondence between the monopole moduli and the vacuum moduli of the five dimensional super yang - mills theory is that the number of the dirac - type singularity corresponds to that of the matter flavor .",
    "asymptotically the relative moduli space of the monopole walls is expected to be the alh space with @xmath16 fibration over @xmath17 . as far as we know , there are no examples of alh hyperkhler metrics in the literature except for the classical metric derived from the effective action of the @xmath18 super yang - mills theory on @xmath19 by haghighat and vandoren @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the doubly - periodic monopoles have rich properties on the d - brane interpretation , string duality , and m - theoretic interpretation via the various s , t - duality transformations @xcite .",
    "therefore the analysis of the moduli metric would be applied to various situation of the corresponding super yang - mills theory , string theory and m - theory .    in this letter , we derive some asymptotic metrics of the monopole walls on @xmath15 by calculating the effective sigma model lagrangian of @xmath3 well - separated bps walls following manton s observation . in our calculation , the bps wall is assumed to be a doubly - periodic superposition of bps monopoles in flat three - space . in the non - periodic direction ,",
    "the walls are assumed to be well - separated to each other compared with the thickness of the monopole wall so that the fields can be well - approximated by superpositions of linearized monopole walls .",
    "the metric computed in this paper is for the case of two identical nonabelian monopole walls , including in the presence of dirac singularities as well .",
    "we prove that the induced metrics actually have the modular invariance with respect to a complex structure @xmath20 of the complex torus @xmath2 in addition to the expected periodicity .",
    "we also present the metrics of monopole walls with dirac - type singularities .",
    "we see that when we consider @xmath3 monopole walls the maximum number of singularities is @xmath21 by a simple analysis using the newton polygon .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the @xmath12 super yang - mills theory the number of the matter flavor has the upper bound @xmath21 .",
    "this bound is due to the requirement that the super yang - mills theory is either conformal or asymptotically free .",
    "when the bound is saturated the theory has conformal invariance .",
    "the present metrics would be the most explicit ones of the alh type derived from the solutions of monopole walls including the case with the dirac - type singularities .",
    "the symmetry and other properties are consistent with the one in the corresponding super yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "let @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) be the coordinates of the three dimensional space @xmath15 in which @xmath24 and @xmath25 are periodic : @xmath26 .",
    "the higgs field @xmath27 and the gauge field @xmath28 satisfy the bogomolny equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 .",
    "we put a condition that the asymptotic behavior of the higgs field of an @xmath0 solution must be @xcite @xmath32 where the constants @xmath33 are called the monopole - wall charges .",
    "these are topological charges which are related to the chern number as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the complex torus at @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the line bundles defined at @xmath38 , respectively , where the monopole vector bundle @xmath39 splits into eigenvalues of the higgs field as @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "numerical solutions of the @xmath0 monopole walls are studied for @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the detailed analysis of the boundary conditions and the moduli space are summarized in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce a standard complex structure @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) at the torus @xmath2 and introduce a holomorphic coordinate @xmath45 .",
    "the periodicity is now represented by @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . by using the vector notation @xmath48 , the metric on @xmath15 is represented as follows : @xmath49 where the volume of the torus is denoted by @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "note that two dimensional metric has three independent components and we have traded them with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "one of the crucial features of our construction of alh hyperkhler metrics in the following is the invariance of the metric under the modular transformation , @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "for the purpose of calculating the effective lagrangian for well - separated monopole walls , we should derive the asymptotic form of the @xmath0 monopole walls .",
    "let us consider @xmath3 well - separated monopole walls sitting at the points @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) . here",
    "each monopole wall has the charge @xmath58 .",
    "it can be regarded as a smooth @xmath0 monopole arranged per unit cell @xcite .",
    "( it is not clear that the multi - monopole walls have the moduli of the separations , however , at least the case of @xmath59 has four - moduli @xcite . ) if the separations @xmath60 are large enough compared with the thicknesses of each monopole wall , the fields are well - approximated by superpositions of linearized monopole walls : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and the background gauge field respectively",
    ". then we can estimate the asymptotic higgs field of each monopole wall as a superposition of linearized t hooft - polyakov monopoles arranged in a finite @xmath64 rhombic lattice , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the magnetic charge of the t hooft - polyakov monopoles .",
    "the summation would diverge in the limit of @xmath67 and @xmath68 to infinity .",
    "such divergence can be avoided in a similar way to the case of periodic monopoles @xcite .",
    "namely , the asymptotic form of @xmath69 for large @xmath70 can be written as @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a positive constant diverging linearly in the limit @xmath73 . by substituting ( [ eqn : asymptotic form of the higgs field ] ) into ( [ eqn : the ansatz of the higgs field ] ) , we obtain @xmath74 where @xmath75 , which can be kept finite with @xmath62 diverging at the same order as @xmath72 .",
    "we note that the configuration is not localized in the periodic directions .",
    "this implies that the superposition of doubly - periodic monopoles is represented as a constituent monopole wall in the asymptotic region .",
    "the asymptotic gauge field can also be derived from the bogomolny equation with ( [ eqn : asymptotic form of the higgs field ] ) , @xmath76 where @xmath77 in order to make the gauge field doubly - periodic for @xmath78 , we have to perform appropriate gauge transformations .",
    "this means our @xmath79 bundle over the complex torus is non - trivial .",
    "accordingly we have to impose the following twisted boundary condition where the phase @xmath80 of any functions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group shifts as follows ; ( cf .",
    "( 12 ) in @xcite ) : @xmath81    for later convenience we introduce the following pair of the harmonic function and the dirac potential on @xmath15 @xmath82 which satisfy @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "note that @xmath85 is a harmonic function on @xmath86 with @xmath87-function source at the origin .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the interaction of non - static monopoles involves not only the relative coordinates but also the relative phases .",
    "the relative phase factor gives rise to non vanishing electric charges and hence converts monopoles into dyons .",
    "the interaction term of the lagrangian can be obtained from the analysis of the forces between bps monopoles .",
    "the fact that there is no force between well - separated bps monopoles with the same charge implies the existence of a long - range interaction caused by the higgs field which becomes massless in the bps limit .",
    "this is also the case for dyons .",
    "thus the lagrangian of the @xmath88 monopole wall can be written as @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the scalar charge , the electric charge and the velocity of @xmath88 monopole wall respectively .",
    "note that all the particles have the same magnetic charge @xmath66 , while the electric charges @xmath91 may change particle by particle in general .",
    "the first term of the lagrangian gives rise to the scalar interaction due to the higgs field .",
    "the second and the third terms are the ordinary lorentz force . the remaining terms describe the dual magnetic interaction to the electric lorentz force .",
    "the relevant field is the dual potential @xmath93 which satisfies @xmath94 .",
    "the background fields @xmath27 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are generated by the remaining @xmath99 moving dyons , which can be obtained from the solutions derived in the previous section . for @xmath100 , the asymptotic fields of @xmath101 dyonic monopole wall at rest can be derived in the same way as the non - periodic monopoles , @xmath102 @xmath103 where @xmath85 and @xmath104 for the monopole wall are given by .",
    "then the fields for a moving monopole can be obtained by the lorentz boost . keeping the terms of order @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    ", we find @xmath108 where the scalar potentials are replaced by the linard - wiechert potentials with the approximation of the distance @xmath109 by @xmath110 .",
    "substituting into the lagrangian for @xmath111 and keeping terms of the second order in @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , we obtain @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the rest mass of the @xmath101 monopole wall and @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , expanding @xmath119 and making symmetrization , we obtain the total lagrangian @xmath120 as @xmath121 the lagrangian may look ill - defined due to the diverging @xmath62 , however , it can be replaced by @xmath122 which remains finite ( cf .",
    ". then the lagrangian can be divided into the two parts : @xmath123 , where    @xmath124    the center of mass lagrangian @xmath125 would diverge while the relative lagrangian @xmath126 would converge in the limit of @xmath127 .",
    "the asymptotic metric of the moduli space can be read from the relative lagrangian . for convenience ,",
    "we introduce relative variables by @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 and further replace the electric charge @xmath132 in @xmath126 by the relative phase @xmath80 via the legendre transformation , @xmath133 as we will see shortly the coefficient of @xmath134 can be fixed so that the asymptotic metric has the double periodicity .",
    "after the legendre transformation , we obtain the asymptotic metric of the moduli space in the form of the gibbons - hawking ansatz @xcite , @xmath135 where @xmath136 at first sight the metric seems to have a constant shift when we go around the closed cycles on @xmath2 , since @xmath137 explicitly depends on the coordinate @xmath138 .",
    "however we can confirm the double - periodicity of the metric by observing that the constant shift of @xmath137 can be cancelled by the phase shift due to the necessary @xmath139 gauge transformation in the twisted boundary conditions ( [ eqn : periodic boundary condition 1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : periodic boundary condition 2 ] ) , which also determines the coefficient of @xmath134 in ( [ eqn : legendre transf . ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we can also easily check the invariance of the metric under the modular transformation ( [ eqn : modular transformation ] ) .",
    "thus our metric is well - defined on @xmath140 with local coordinates @xmath141 .",
    "finally the hyperkhler metric allows the following local isometries with parameters @xmath142 ; @xmath143    it is straightforward to extend the above computation for @xmath144 to the case of general @xmath3 .",
    "the total lagrangian of the @xmath3 well - separated monopole walls can be obtained by generalizing ( [ eqn : the total lagrangian of 2-monopole wall ] ) as follows @xmath145 this can be decomposed into the two parts @xmath146 , where    @xmath147    on the other hand , the gibbons - hawking ansatz for general @xmath3 can be written as @xmath148 where @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are relative coordinates measured by the position of @xmath154 monopole wall . by comparing the coefficients of ( [ eqn : the relative lagrangian of multi - monopole wall ] ) and the sigma model lagrangian for the gibbons - hawking ansatz , we find : @xmath155",
    "finally , we discuss the asymptotic metrics of monopole walls with dirac - type singularities . in the case of monopole chains with four - moduli , it is proved that the maximum number of dirac singularities is four . here",
    "we derive the inequality for the maximum number of dirac singularities of monopole walls by using the spectral curves and the newton polygon @xcite .",
    "monopole wall with charge @xmath156 .",
    ", width=151,height=151 ]    a spectral curve of a monopole wall is defined by @xmath157 $ ] , where @xmath158 is an integral of @xmath159 in the @xmath24-direction and @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "the spectral curve also induces a spectral polynomial @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a common denominator of @xmath163 .",
    "then the newton polygon @xmath164 of @xmath165 can be constructed as follows .",
    "firstly we mark points @xmath166 corresponding to the degree of each term @xmath167 of @xmath165 on an integer lattice .",
    "then the newton polygon is a minimal convex polygon including all the marks .",
    "for example , the spectral curves of the @xmath0 monopole walls can be written as @xmath168 , where @xmath169 , which leads to the newton polygon of an @xmath0 monopole wall with the charge @xmath59 as in figure [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "in addition , the shape of the newton polygon is restricted by the boundary data .",
    "for example , the numbers of points on top and bottom edges are equal to @xmath170 , where @xmath171 are the number of positive and negative dirac singularities of a @xmath4 monopole wall",
    ". moreover , there is an important relation between the number of internal points of the newton polygon , @xmath172 , and the dimension of the moduli space @xmath173 of the corresponding monopole walls : @xmath174    keeping these in mind , the upper limit of the number of singularities of @xmath4 monopoles can be easily obtained as follows . for a given number of internal points , the maximum newton polygon of monopole walls with singularities must be a trapezoid , which has height 2 and has length of top and bottom edges @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively ( figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) .     of a @xmath4 monopole wall with @xmath175 singularities and @xmath176 singularities.,width=283,height=283 ]    from the shape of the newton polygon ,",
    "the maximum number of singularities obviously have a relation , @xmath177 ( which can also be derived by the pick s formula ) .",
    "thus the total number of the singularities @xmath178 is limited as @xmath179 especially the maximum number of singularities of @xmath3 well - separated monopole walls is @xmath21 because the dimension of the relative moduli space is @xmath180 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the maximal number of the matter hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation is @xmath21 in the corresponding @xmath12 super yang - mills theory with eight super charges .",
    "here we restrict our calculation to the monopole walls with four - moduli , that is , for @xmath144 .",
    "then the maximal number of the dirac singularities is @xmath181 .",
    "since these singularities are stationary and have no electric charge , the metric can be obtained by simply replacing the vacuum expectation value and the background field by @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the magnetic charges and the positions of each singularity @xcite . substituting them into ( [ eqn : coefficients of the asymptotic metric of the moduli space of 2-monopole wall ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath186 where @xmath187 and we assume @xmath188 .    in the correspondence with @xmath189 super yang - mills theory on @xmath190 ,",
    "the function @xmath191 is identified with the low energy effective coupling , or the second derivative of the prepotential on the coulomb modulus @xmath192 .",
    "in this letter , we have obtained new hyperkhler metrics whose asymptotic behavior is the alh type from the moduli space of monopole walls .",
    "the metric in four dimensions is defined on a @xmath193 fibration over @xmath86 and enjoys the modular invariance on @xmath2 .",
    "we have also derive the maximal number of the dirac singularities by using the newton polygon of the spectral curve .",
    "one of the next challenges is the low - energy scattering of the monopole walls as a geodesic motion on the moduli space . in the present discussion ,",
    "the monopoles are assumed to be well - separated and hence the collision process is excluded .    in order to obtain a global metric on the moduli space of monopole walls , we need some ideas such as the one for the atiyah - hitchin metric @xcite for non - periodic bps @xmath194-monopole . on the super yang - mills theory side , the region of well - separated monopoles corresponds to the weak coupling region of the moduli space of the coulomb branch , where the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields in the vector multiplets are large compared with the dynamical scale of the theory . in order to obtain a global metric which is valid on the whole coulomb branch ,",
    "the inclusion of instanton corrections is crucial .",
    "a successful example of such computation is the ooguri - vafa metric @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for recent developments .    in the periodic monopoles ,",
    "the monopole scattering has been successfully discussed by using the nahm transform , the spectral curve and the corresponding hitchin equation @xcite .",
    "these methods could be applied to the doubly - periodic case .",
