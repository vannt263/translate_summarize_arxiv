    "in contrast to pure em theory , exact solutions of higher dimensional charged rotating black holes are known in theories with more symmetries .",
    "the presence of a chern - simons ( cs ) term , for instance , leads to a class of odd - dimensional einstein - maxwell - chern - simons ( emcs ) theories , comprising the bosonic sector of minimal @xmath9 supergravity , whose stationary black hole solutions @xcite possess surprising properties @xcite . in particular , in emcs theory , even black holes with horizons of spherical topology are no longer uniquely characterized by their global charges ( beyond a critical value of the cs coupling constant ) @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of additional fields , as required by supersymmetry or string theory , leads to further exact solutions of higher dimensional black holes @xcite , since then certain constructive methods are available , such as hassan - sen transformations @xcite .",
    "here we construct exact solutions of rotating black holes in @xmath0 dimensions , by embedding the @xmath0-dimensional myers - perry solutions in @xmath2 dimensions , and performing a boost with respect to the time and the additional coordinate , followed by a kaluza - klein reduction to @xmath0 dimensions @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads to einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) black holes in @xmath0 dimensions , for particular values of the dilaton coupling constant .",
    "the solutions are completely general , with dependence on the mass @xmath10 , the @xmath6 angular momenta @xmath11 , and the charge @xmath12 . like their em counterparts @xcite",
    "they satisfy a smarr formula and the first law of black hole mechanics .",
    "the corresponding emd solutions in 4 dimensions have been known since long @xcite , including their dyonic generalizations @xcite .",
    "after recalling the myers - perry black holes in section 2 , we present the rotating emd black holes in section 3 , we obtain their global and horizon properties in section 4 , and we discuss their domains of existence in section 5 .",
