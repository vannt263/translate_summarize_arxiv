    "the potts model@xcite , as a generalization of the famous ising model , plays an important role in the study of phase transition and critical phenomena , which shows a typical phase transition of symmetry breaking .",
    "this model is widely studied , including the ferromagnetic case and antiferromagnetic case .",
    "however , the research of the quantum version of the model , i.e. , the quantum potts model@xcite is relatively few@xcite .",
    "this seems somewhat strange , comparing to the fact that the quantum version of the ising model , namely the quantum ising model or the transverse field ising model , has been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "the quantum phase transition of the one dimensional ferromagnetic quantum potts model is well understood@xcite , the critical point @xmath2 for all @xmath3 , and the universality class being same as the corresponding two dimensional classical potts model , which is first order for @xmath4 and continuous for @xmath5 .",
    "the two dimensional ferromagnetic quantum potts model is studied by the infinite projected entangled - pair state ( ipeps ) algorithm@xcite , showing that both the 3-state and 4-state ferromagnetic quantum potts models undergo a first - order phase transition .",
    "this result is easy to understand , because their classical correspondence , namely the classical three dimensional 3-state and 4-state ferromagnetic potts models , also undergo first - order phase transitions . for the antiferromagnetic quantum potts model , to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the study is almost blank except the recent work on the mixed classical potts model@xcite , which can be considered as the classical correspondence of it .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the quantum potts model by the means of monte carlo simulations in the frame of stochastic series expansion ( sse ) , using a cluster algorithm which is a direct generalization of the cluster algorithm for quantum ising model .",
    "our study include both the ferromagnetic case and antiferromagnetic case .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum potts model@xcite can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath9 matrices .",
    "@xmath7 is a diagonal one , @xmath10 and @xmath8 is an off - diagonal one , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a @xmath13 identity matrix .",
    "this model is ferromagnetic for @xmath14 or antiferromagnetic for @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the strength of the transverse field . when @xmath17 it reduces to the quantum ising model .",
    "the exponential of the partition function @xmath18 in sse method@xcite is written as a taylor expansion @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the standard spin basis .",
    "then , by inserting a set of complete basis , the partition function is rewritten as @xmath21 with @xmath22 .    in the next step ,",
    "the hamiltonian is written as a sum of elementary lattice operators @xmath23 the subscript @xmath24 and @xmath25 refer to the type and the position of the operators respectively .",
    "therefore , the partition function can be written as @xmath26 with @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28$],@xmath29 , @xmath30 $ ] the sequence of operators .",
    "the taylor expansion in ( [ sse1 ] ) can be truncated at certain power @xmath31 for facilitating the implementation of the updating scheme .",
    "if @xmath31 is large enough , the truncation error should be completely negligible . after the truncation",
    ", the partition function is written as @xmath32 the binomial coefficient @xmath33 comes from the random insertion of the @xmath34 unit operators(which is often called ` vacant ' operator in sse simulations ) , because @xmath35 .",
    "( [ sse ] ) is the starting point of the sse monte carlo simulation , it defines the ` sse configuration ' which consists of a sequence of states @xmath36=@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath29 , @xmath39 with @xmath40 to @xmath31 ( with @xmath41=@xmath42 ) and operators , whose weight is @xmath43 fig .",
    "[ ssecfg ] shows a typical sse configuration .",
    "it should be noted that it is not necessary to store all the states in the propagation direction , the information of @xmath41 and the sequence of operators can generate all the states .        in the quantum potts model , the local basis ( spin states ) can be chosen as the eigenstates of the diagonal matrix @xmath7 , take the case of @xmath44 for example , the local spin states are @xmath45    -type and @xmath46-type vertexes are diagonal , the @xmath47-type vertex is off - diagonal . ]    and the local hamiltonian @xmath48 includes the diagonal operator @xmath49 and the off - diagonal operator ( transverse field ) @xmath50 . for facilitating the simulation , we further define a diagonal operator @xmath51 .",
    "this operator also shifts the energy of the system but does not change the substantial physical properties of the model .",
    "the ` vertex ' for the sse simulation can be defined based on the operator and the states of the spins connected to it , whose weight is @xmath52 .",
    "corresponding to the operators , there are three types of vertexes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ssevertex ] .",
    "the weight of the @xmath53-type vertex is @xmath54 when @xmath55 , the weight is negative , which will lead to sign problem , thus in the simulations this weight is set as @xmath56 , which only shifts the energy of the system , but avoids the sign problem if the value of @xmath57 is set properly . in the cluster algorithm that we will describe below",
    ", this value must be set as @xmath58 for the ferromagnetic case ( @xmath58=1 ) and @xmath59 for the antiferromagnetic case ( @xmath58=-1 ) .",
    "the weights of the @xmath47-type and @xmath46-type vertexes are @xmath60 the weights of the two types of vertexes are complementary to each other , which allows a free change of the two types of vertexes to each other in the procedure of simulation .",
    "this is very important for the realization of the off - diagonal update of the sse configuration , including both the metropolis algorithm and the cluster algorithm .    the simulation of eq .",
    "( [ sse ] ) consists of the ` diagonal update ' and ` off - diagonal update ' . for the diagonal update ,",
    "the procedure consists of inserting a diagonal vertex to the sequence or removing a existing one .",
    "both the @xmath53-type and @xmath46 type vertexes are diagonal , and the metropolis procedure is performed as    1 .",
    "if the vertex is vacant , the probability of trying to insert a @xmath53-type vertex is @xmath61 , accordingly , the probability of trying to insert a @xmath46-type vertex is @xmath62 .",
    "the acceptance probability of inserting the @xmath53-type vertex is @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the total number of bonds of the lattice .",
    "the acceptance probability of inserting a @xmath46-type vertex is @xmath65 2 .",
    "if the vertex is a diagonal one , then if it is @xmath53-type , the acceptance probability of removing it is @xmath66 otherwise ( it must be @xmath46-type ) , the acceptance probability of removing it is @xmath67    the selecting probability @xmath61 can be adjusted to make the acceptance probability of inserting or removing to be a moderate one .",
    "the off - diagonal update does not change the number of vertexes , but changes the type of vertexes .",
    "in hard - core boson or heisenberg model or some other models , a loop algorithm is used , which is very efficient . for the quantum potts model",
    ", two algorithms can be used for this purpose .",
    "the first one is a local updating algorithm ( metropolis ) , which is based on the fact that the change of the @xmath47-type vertex to @xmath46-type vertex or conversely does not change the weight of the sse configuration . for example , in fig .",
    "[ ssecfg ] change of the state of the series of spins between the vertexes a and b ( the state is @xmath68 ) does not change the weight of the configuration ; the state can be randomly given to be one of the @xmath3 potts states and the type of vertexes @xmath69 and @xmath70 should be changed from @xmath47-type to @xmath46-type , if the state is changed to @xmath71 .",
    "such algorithm is very easy to be implemented in compute programming .",
    "however , the efficiency of the metropolis algorithm is not satisfactory , especially for the large system at or near the critical point . which suffers from the problem of critical slowing down .",
    "therefore the simulations call for a nonlocal algorithm .",
    "such algorithm is available for our model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a cluster algorithm is proposed for the quantum ising model , which can be directly generalized to the quantum potts model . in such algorithm , the construction of a cluster is started from a randomly selected leg of one vertex ( not vacant ) , for example , a leg of a @xmath53-type vertex , then all the four legs and their links are considered to be in the same cluster and stored in the stack , then the links of the legs are used to be the new stating point ( four branches ) of the cluster constructing procedure . if the link is one of the leg of a @xmath47-type or @xmath46-type operator , the constructing procedure terminates in such branch .",
    "the constructing procedure continues until all the possible branches terminates , then all the sates of spins of the cluster is flipped at the same time . for the quantum potts model",
    ", the construction of the cluster is _ exactly _ the same as the quantum ising model , but the spin state of the cluster is randomly set as one of the @xmath3 potts states ; we also call this procedure as ` flip ' .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the const @xmath57 is set as @xmath58 for the ferromagnetic model , therefore the weights of the vertexes as shown in the second and third rows of fig .",
    "[ ssevertex ] are zero , and the spins in the same cluster must have the same states . in the numerical procedure , one can construct all the clusters and flip every cluster with probability 1/2 or construct _",
    "one _ cluster and flip it with probability 1 .",
    "the former is similar to the swendsen - wang algorithm@xcite and the later is similar to the wolff algorithm@xcite .    for the antiferromagnetic quantum potts model , the diagonal update and the local algorithm for the off - diagonal update is the same as the ferromagnetic quantum potts model , but the cluster algorithm have to be modified .",
    "take the three - state potts model for example , in the cluster constructing procedure , we can let the spins with state @xmath71 be frozen , and the cluster is constructed for the spins with value @xmath72 or @xmath68 . as mentioned earlier , the const @xmath57 is set as @xmath59 , therefore the weights of the vertexes as shown in the first row of fig .",
    "[ ssevertex ] are are zero ; every pair of spins at the same side of a @xmath53-type vertex must have different states .",
    "after the construction , the state of the spin in the cluster should be changed from @xmath72 to @xmath68 or conversely ( flip ) .",
    "sincerely , we can also froze the spins with state @xmath72 , and flip the spins with state @xmath71 or @xmath68 ; or froze @xmath68 , and flip @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the ideal of such algorithm is very similar to the wang - swendsen - koteck algorithm@xcite of the classical antiferromagnetic potts model .",
    "the temperature is set as @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 . for the 3-state quantum potts model ,",
    "the simulated variables include the total energy @xmath75 , the interaction energy @xmath76 , the the magnetization @xmath77 , and the binder ratio @xmath78 @xmath79 with @xmath80 here , the states of the spins has been mapped to two dimensional vectors by the rule @xmath81 with @xmath82 . in ( [ en ] ) , the const @xmath83 is added to remove the energy shift that comes from the @xmath53-type and @xmath46-type vertexes .    ; right , the interaction energy @xmath76 . ]",

    "@xmath90 is the exponent of the irrelevant field in renormalization , which is negative ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 are unknown parameters ; @xmath93 is a shape - dependent universal parameter .",

    "now we turn to the two dimensional model .",

    "[ e3sq ] shows the total energy of the three - state quantum potts model on the square lattice , which does not show any singularity .",
    "however the interaction energy @xmath76 shown in the right of fig .",

    "figure [ m3sq ] shows the curves of @xmath77 and @xmath78 versus @xmath107 for a series of @xmath105 , it also obviously shows the phase transition ; the sharp falling of the magnetization the downward peak of the binder ratio verifies that the transition is a first order one . from the behaviors of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , the transition point",
    "is estimated to be @xmath108 .",
    "we also simulate the antiferromagnetic quantum potts model on the square lattice . in this case",
    "another order parameter called staggered magnetization is defined @xmath109 with @xmath110 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112 are defined by the similar way of ( [ mu ] ) , but confined to the sublattices @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively ; a lattice site belongs to sublattice @xmath69 or @xmath70 according to the parity of @xmath113 , with @xmath114 the coordinate of the site .",
    "the binder ratio of @xmath115 is defined by the similar way of ( [ qm ] ) @xmath116    the transition of the antiferromagnetic quantum potts model is found to be continuous .",
    "the curves of the energy , the magnetization and the binder ratio are similar to those of the one dimensional ferromagnetic quantum potts model .",
    "the data of @xmath117 near the critical point can be fit by the formula ( [ qmfss ] ) , which gives @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 .",
    "the value of @xmath121 falls in the universality class of the three - dimensional classical @xmath0 model ; to confirm this conclusion , we further simulate the model exactly at the critical point , and the data of @xmath115 can also be fit with the ansatz ( [ mfss ] ) .",
    "the fitting gives @xmath122 , which is also consistent with the value of the three - dimensional classical @xmath0 model .",
    "however , it should be noted that the symmetry of the ordered phase of the model ( with small @xmath107 ) is @xmath1 , which can be clearly demonstrated by the histogram of the staggered magnetization @xmath123 , as shown in fig . [ histo](a ) .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry is not difficult to understand . in the ordered phase ,",
    "an ideal ordered configuration may be : the spins on sublattice a take states @xmath71 , while the spins on the sublattice b randomly take states @xmath72 or @xmath68 .",
    "there are six types of the such ideal states , owing to the permutation of the three states and the permutation of the two sublattices , therefore the symmetry of the order parameter is @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 universality class of the phase transition is owing to the ` emergent ' o(2 ) symmetry .",
    "[ histo](b ) and ( c ) give the histograms with @xmath107 slightly below and exactly at the critical point respectively , which obviously demonstrates the o(2 ) symmetry .",
    "the above results for the three - state quantum antiferromagnetic potts model is very similar to the classical mixed potts model@xcite on simple cubic lattice , which can be considered as the classical correspondence of this model in the sense of universality .    .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the three - state quantum potts model by monte carlo simulations in the frame of sse ; the cluster algorithm we used is a direct generalization of that for the quantum ising model .",
    "the study includes the one and two dimensional ferromagnetic cases and the two dimensional antiferromagnetic case .",
    "the phase transition and critical phenomena are the same as the @xmath124 dimensional classical potts model in the sense of universality .",
    "the classical antiferromagnetic potts model has very interesting phase transitions and critical phenomena@xcite , especially in two dimensions .",
    "generally , the symmetry of the order parameter is determined not only by the symmetry of the potts spin but also the lattice structure , for which the @xmath1 and ` emergent ' o(2 ) symmetry is a good example ; therefore the model may have different phases and phase transitions on different lattices for the same @xmath3 .",
    "it is an interesting question if the quantum fluctuation is introduced for the antiferromagnetic potts model .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "the mixed potts model with @xmath125 , 5 , and 6 are also studied , where an ` emergent ' o(n ) symmetry is found , with @xmath126 .",
    "it is very possible that it is also the case for the antiferromagnetic quantum potts model on the square lattice ; we leave this question for further study .",
