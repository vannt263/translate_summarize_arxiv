    "the presence of small amounts of liquid can have a considerable influence on the properties of granular matter .",
    "for example , the angle of repose of a wet granular pile is greater than that of a dry pile made of the same material .",
    "cohesive forces are introduced because of liquid bridges that are formed between particles .",
    "cohesivity causes jamming in the flow of granular matter even in a regime where dry granular matter may flow .",
    "wet granular matter is also observed to segregate less than dry granular matter as particles can not move easily relative to each other .",
    "although these qualitative facts are well known , a detailed knowledge of the properties even in comparison with dry granular matter has not yet been attained .",
    "the properties of dry granular matter have attracted a considerable number of studies .",
    "granular matter in a box which is tilted does not flow until a certain angle is exceeded at the surface .",
    "this angle usually called the maximum angle of stability @xmath0 depends on the frictional properties and the packing of the granular matter . however ,",
    "if the granular matter is in motion , it can relax down to a lower angle which is called the angle of repose @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of the lower @xmath1 may be due to the lower kinetic friction compared to static friction between the particles and other dynamical effects  @xcite .",
    "the observed hysteresis may also occur because there are infinitely many meta - stable states above @xmath1 in which the system can get trapped  @xcite .    in case of a very large pile of granular matter",
    ", it has been argued that @xmath0 is unaffected by the cohesivity introduced by the presence of the fluid .",
    "this is true provided that the frictional properties between the particles are unaltered due to the presence of a lubrication layer .",
    "the basic argument is that while frictional force which helps hold a pile together increases with the size of the pile , the cohesive force is constant and becomes insignificant in comparison  @xcite .",
    "however the effects can be important for a laboratory or industrial scale system .",
    "recently , there have been a number of studies that have tried to relate the fluid content and its surface tension to observed increase in angles .",
    "@xmath1 measured by schiffer and collaborators  @xcite using the draining crater method is observed to initially increase linearly and then fluctuate around a constant value .",
    "for an ideal sphere - sphere contact , increasing the liquid content will lead to decreased cohesive force and hence a lowered @xmath1 .",
    "therefore they proposed that particle surface roughness plays an important role and a cone - plane type of contact between particles may be more appropriate .",
    "they also believed that the fluid coats the particles evenly .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the distribution of the fluid on the surface of the particles using optical fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy .",
    "these studies appear to show that the fluid is in fact trapped in the menisci that are formed at the asperity on the grain surface .",
    "they have therefore claimed that the behavior of @xmath0 at low volume fractions of the fluid is consistent with a scaling theory based on the surface roughness of the grains  @xcite .",
    "other studies note that considerable differences between @xmath1 and @xmath0 can arise when humidity is present and have shown that the wetting properties of the fluid can be also important  @xcite .",
    "the identification of the occurance and the extent of segregation is of considerable importance in material handling in industry .",
    "preferential percolation of small particles through layers of larger particles is usually identified as leading to segregation when granular flows occur at a free surface  @xcite .",
    "stratification can occur in such systems if rough and smooth shaped grains are present  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the fluid alters the percolation of particles  @xcite and thus has a profound influence on the progress of segregation in granular matter .",
    "it is thus surprising that the effects of the fluid on the progress of segregation has not been investigated in detail till recently . in a recent publication",
    ", we reported that the presence of a fluid drastically reduces segregation in bidisperse granular matter that is poured into a silo  @xcite .",
    "although it is clear that the surface tension of the fluid is important in determining the cohesive force and hence @xmath1 , the role of the viscosity of the fluid @xmath2 may be less obvious .",
    "it is a common observation that a finger dipped in honey feels sticky in comparison to a finger dipped in water .",
    "this occurs because stronger forces are required to move the liquid into regions that are vacated .",
    "therefore viscous forces may have a significant effect on the dynamics of the grains .",
    "it is thus important to investigate the effect of @xmath2 on both @xmath1 and on size separation .",
    "furthermore , viscous effects grow in importance for smaller dimensions",
    ". it may be possible to understand the effects of humidity on powders , that are smaller in size in comparison , by investigating effects of viscosity on segregation in granular systems",
    ". this may be useful because quantitative studies with powders are more difficult to conduct .    in this context",
    ", we report a detailed study of the angle of repose and segregation of granular matter in the presence of a fluid using high resolution digital imaging .",
    "some of the results have been reported in a letter  @xcite and here we report additional data and analysis .",
    "we first investigate the effect of the size of the particles on @xmath1 as a function of the volume fraction of the fluid .",
    "we also discuss in detail our experimental observation of the effect of the viscosity @xmath2 of the fluid on @xmath1 .",
    "we then study the extent of segregation by visualizing the color - coded glass particles using bidisperse glass beads with size ratio @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , the decrease in segregation is observed to saturate at similar values of volume fraction as @xmath1 .",
    "it can be also noted that small particles preferentially clump in a bidisperse mixture and this leads to subtle effects on the nature of the particle spatial - distribution as the volume fraction of the fluid is increased . as the volume fraction of the fluid increases and as the limit",
    "is approached where all the interstitial volume is saturated with the fluid , one can expect that the effects of the cohesion introduced by liquid bridges to become less important .",
    "this may have an effect on @xmath1 and size separation . however , there are practical difficulties in investigating high volume fractions because the fluid tends to drain",
    ". therefore we also conducted experiments when the particles are completely immersed in a fluid to understand this limit .",
    "a schematic of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig .",
    "[ exp_app ] .",
    "a rectangular silo of dimensions @xmath4 and a width @xmath5 of @xmath6 is used for the experiments .",
    "the flow is visualized through the glass side - walls of the silo using a 1000 pixel @xmath7 1000 pixel kodak es 1.0 digital camera .",
    "the glass particles and fluids used are listed in table  [ particles ] and table  [ fluids ] respectively .",
    "the granular sample is prepared in batches by throughly mixing 1.0  kilogram of each of the two kinds of particles with the fluid before the mixture is placed inside the reservoir .",
    "the volume fraction @xmath8 of the fluid is calculated as the ratio of the volume of the fluid to the volume of all the particles .",
    "the volume of the particles corresponds to the weight of the particles divided by the density of the glass beads which is @xmath9 .",
    "the wet granular material is first filled into a reservoir and then drained through a pipe into the silo . in previous experiments we demonstrated that segregation can occur during draining of a wide silo  @xcite , and therefore a tall cylindrical reservoir is used to minimize segregation from occuring during pouring .",
    "pipes with various diameters are used to control the flow rate @xmath10 .",
    "larger diameters are used at higher @xmath8 in order to maintain @xmath11  g s@xmath12 .",
    "the reservoir is raised at a slow constant rate with a stepper motor and a system of pulleys .",
    "the slow upward velocity of the reservoir allows the particles to accumulate inside the pipe before flowing down the surface and reduces the kinetic energy of particles due to free fall .",
    "such precautions are necessary otherwise particles acquire substantial kinetic energy during free fall and tend to bounce back from the surface several times leading to size separation and stratification in the case of bidisperse particles .",
    "smaller particles bounce back higher from the surface of the pile and land further down the pile in contrast to what is usually observed , i.e. small particles at the top of the sandpile .",
    "this effect coupled with periodic avalanching observed at the surface can lead to alternate layers of mixed and small particles . by using the pipe ,",
    "we ensure that the interaction of particles is restricted to the surface of the pile .",
    "thus the number of mechanisms involved in segregation is reduced and the system is simpler .",
    "we varied the time that the sample was mixed and found it had little effect on @xmath1 .",
    "we also waited a varying amount of time before pouring to test the effect of evaporation .",
    "we found that only in the case of water , there was a small influence if we waited for one hour for volume fractions below @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , to minimize the effects of evaporation , the mixture was poured immediately after mixing .",
    "a triangular shaped granular pile is formed after the material is poured into the silo .",
    "the flow of the granular material is continuous for dry particles , but becomes increasingly stick - slip as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "the flowing region is roughly 10 layers deep for dry particles , but the flow region becomes deeper and is not as well defined as @xmath8 is increased .",
    "the resulting pile for monodisperse glass particles is shown in fig .",
    "[ roughness ] and it can be observed that the surface of the wet pile is at a greater inclination than the dry pile .",
    "@xmath1 is measured by obtaining images of the sand pile after the silo is filled and fitting a straight line to the surface of the pile .",
    "the obtained slope is averaged over 10 - 15 images as a centimeter deep layer of granular matter is added and a new surface is created .",
    "@xmath1 is plotted as a function of @xmath8 for particles with various diameters @xmath14 in fig .",

    "this fact can be qualitatively noted from fig .",
    "[ roughness ] .",
    "the increase and approximate saturation of @xmath1 is qualitatively similar to those earlier observed using the draining crater method  @xcite .",
    "quantitative differences exist perhaps because of the difference in the geometries . as discussed in the introduction , both the increase in @xmath1 and",
    "saturation is surprising if one assumes ideal spheres in contact . to explain this property",

    "it has been assumed here that the capillary force @xmath22 between the particles is given by @xmath23 .",
    "they assume that the saturation will occur approximately when the wetting is determined by the macroscopic curvature of the particles , which is greater than the scale of the roughness of the surface of the particles .",
    "according to the model , volume @xmath15 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is length scale over which fluctuations occur .",
    "the model predicts that @xmath0 decreases with @xmath14 , which is consistent with our observations .",
    "although there is a qualitative agreement between our data for @xmath1 and the model for @xmath0  @xcite , there is considerable disagreement related to the value of @xmath15 .",
    "for example for 1 mm particles , where the particle surface fluctuations are about @xmath26 m , the model predicts saturation for @xmath27 .",
    "however the observed @xmath15 is significantly higher and is approximately @xmath28 .    while it is possible that the disagreement can arise because @xmath0 is calculated and @xmath1 is measured , additional effects may have to be taken into account in calculating the average cohesive force due to capillary bridges .",
    "for example , it has been assumed that only the capillary forces between particles in contact is important .",
    "however it is possible that as @xmath8 increases , particles that are slightly away from each other can also form liquid bridges .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the average number of liquid bridges per particle increases with @xmath8",
    ". this effect may be important in determining the regime over which @xmath1 can increase .",

    "a similar effect is observed for the other size ratios .    besides the increase of @xmath1 due to the addition of the fluid , the surface of the pile",

    "we observe that smaller particles clump more than larger particles at similar @xmath8 .",
    "we therefore believe that the increased roughness of the surface is because of clumping of the particles .",
    "as the particles form more clumps , the surface becomes increasingly rough and @xmath31 grows .",
    "the standard deviation of @xmath1 obtained by repeating measurements for a particular @xmath8 was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite as a measure of clumping .",
    "the reported observations are consistent with our more direct measurement of the surface heights .",
    "we will later see that the preferential clumping of small particles has an important effect on the progress of segregation and introduces layering .      to investigate the effect of viscosity on the flow and the angle of repose , we kept the surface tension of the fluid constant and change @xmath2 of the fluid . because water and glycerol have very similar surface tension , we used mixtures of these two fluids to change @xmath2  @xcite .",

    "we have thus shown that the viscosity of the fluid clearly influences the observed @xmath1 . in the next section",

    "based on reynolds lubrication theory , an expression for the viscous force has been derived for two identical rigid spherical surfaces  @xcite .",

    "@xcite experimentally investigated the effect of viscosity of the fluid on the properties of a liquid bridge between two moving spheres .",

    "the capillary force estimated using @xmath46 for 1 mm particles is @xmath47 n. therefore the viscous force for glycerol is relevant whereas for water the viscous force may be insignificant .",
    "these improved results are also consistent with our previous estimates obtained neglecting the curvature of the particles  @xcite .",
    "because viscous force decreases with relative velocity it appears surprising that the viscosity of fluid plays any role at all in determining @xmath1 in our experiments and we return to this point later in the paper .",
    "however it is clear that such forces are important in determining the extent of segregation as it occurs when the particles are in motion .",
    "to study the segregation of the particles in the pile , we use different colors for the two kinds of particles .",

    "the small particles appear white and the large particles appear black .",
    "thus strong size separation is observed as the granular matter flow down the inclined surface .",
    "two main mechanisms are important in determining the observed spatial distribution : ( i ) the void filling mechanism where smaller particles percolate through the larger particles and are thus found at the bottom of the flow  @xcite , and ( ii ) the capture mechanism where the smaller particles which are more sensitive to surface fluctuations are stopped at the top of the pile before the larger particles  @xcite . segregation is observed to vanish when a small amount of fluid is added .",

    "the viscous force damps velocity fluctuation as it increases with relative velocity between particles . because velocity fluctuations and percolation are required for segregation , @xmath54 is therefore observed to be lower at higher @xmath2 for similar @xmath18 .",
    "since the linear increase of @xmath1 , and decrease of @xmath54 occurs below a similar @xmath15 , and both of these quantities saturate above this volume fraction , the cohesion due to the fluid appears to have the same effect on both @xmath1 and @xmath54 .",
    "in this section , we study the angle of repose and the progress of segregation when the bidisperse glass particles are poured into a silo filled with various liquids with different @xmath2 .",
    "the procedure and the system is similar to the previous sections except that in these experiments , we first fill the silo with the fluid and then pour the dry granular matter . in this case",
    "only viscous forces are present and capillary forces are not present because liquid bridges are absent .    because the terminal velocity for particles decreases with @xmath2 ,",
    "they take a significantly longer time to drain in a viscous fluid compared to that in air and @xmath66 g s@xmath12 in glycerol .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased , the particles are increasingly observed to deviate from a downward trajectory and are deflected further down the slope even before coming in contact with the surface .",
    "the reason for the deflection of the particles can be qualitatively understood as follows . for a particle moving with velocity @xmath67 , a boundary layer develops in the fluid which is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "this estimate is essentially from dimensional arguments  @xcite .",
    "as the distance between the particle and the surface becomes comparable to the size of this boundary layer , the particles feel a net horizontal force similar to the viscous forces discussed earlier due to fluid expulsion .",
    "these forces tend to deflect the particles further down the slope .",
    "we observed @xmath1 is @xmath69 for mono and bidisperse glass particles for not only water and glycerol but also using polybutene ( see table  [ fluids ] ) . unlike the case of partial @xmath8 , no systematic dependence of @xmath1 is observed on the viscosity .",
    "furthermore , the observed @xmath1 in the fluid is very similar to that observed in air .",

    "thus the capture mechanism which is sensitive to surface roughness decreases in importance with @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , velocity fluctuations at higher @xmath2 are damped out as particles reach terminal velocity over a short distance leading to a reduction in percolation of particles  @xcite .",
    "therefore the segregation decreases because the two mechanism which cause segregation in dry granular matter diminish in strength .",
    "it is well known that sedimentation of different sized particles ( for example in lakes ) cause layering of different size particles to occur at the bottom because the terminal velocity reached by a spherical particle is proportional to @xmath70 .",
