    "the theoretical treatment of the longstanding problem of turbulent flows @xcite has to relate dynamical systems theory with non - equilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the central notion of physical turbulence theory is the concept of the energy cascade , highlighting the fact that turbulent flows are essentially transport processes of quantities like energy or enstrophy in scale .",
    "although well - established theories due to richardson , kolmogorov , onsager , heisenberg and others ( for reviews we refer the reader to @xcite ) can capture gross features of the cascade process in a phenomenological way , the dynamical aspects are by far less understood , and usually are investigated by direct numerical simulations of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "an exception , in some sense , are inviscid fluid flows in two dimensions . based on the work of helmholtz @xcite ,",
    "it was kirchhoff @xcite who pointed out that the partial differential equation can be reduced to a hamiltonian system for the locations of point vortices , provided one considers initial conditions where the vorticity is a superposition of delta - distributions ( we refer the reader to the works of aref @xcite as well as the monographs @xcite ) . due to onsager @xcite ( for a discussion we refer the reader to @xcite ) a statistical treatment of point vortex dynamics is possible for equilibrium situations because of the hamiltonian character of the dynamics , provided the ergodic hypothesis holds .",
    "extensions to non - equilibrium situations based on kinetic equations have been pursued , e.g. , by joyce and montgomery @xcite , lundgren and pointin @xcite , as well as more recently by chavanis @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to generalize kirchhoff s point vortex model to a rotor model that exhibits the formation of large - scale vortical structures due to the formation of rotor clusters .",
    "the existence of such a process in two - dimensional flows where a large - scale vorticity field spontaneously emerges from an initially random distribution of vortices was first predicted by kraichnan @xcite and is termed an inverse cascade .",
    "thereby , the energy that is injected into the small scales is transfered to larger scales , whereas the enstrophy follows a direct cascade from large to small scales .",
    "it was also kraichnan @xcite , who gave an intuitive explanation of the possible mechanism of the cascade : he considered a small - scale axisymmetric vortical structure that is exposed to a large - scale strain field .",
    "eventually , the vortex is elongated along the stretching direction of the strain , i.e. to a first approximation drawn out into an elliptical structure .",
    "this thinning mechanism induces relative motions between vortices that have been deformed under their mutual strain , which leads to a decrease of the kinetic energy of the small - scale motion and consequently to an energy transfer upscale .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed out numerically and experimentally by chen et al .",
    "@xcite that the effect of vortex thinning is indeed an important feature of the inverse cascade .",
    "an appropriate vortex model for the inverse cascade therefore has to provide a mechanism similar to that identified in @xcite .",
    "although , several point vortex models have been known for a long time to form large - scale vortical structures from an initially random distribution of point vortices due to the events of vortex merging @xcite or special forcing mechanisms @xcite , an explicit inclusion of the concept of vortex thinning never has been taken into account . in our vortex model ,",
    "the small - scale vortical structure is represented by a rotor consisting of two point vortices with equal circulation that are glued together by a nonelastic bond .",
    "the main observation now is that the two co - rotating point vortices mimic a far - field that is similar to an elliptical vortex , which makes the rotor sensitive to a large - scale strain .",
    "the model is motivated by a representation of the vorticity field as a superposition of vortices with elliptical gaussian shapes along the lines of melander , styczek and zabusky @xcite .",
    "the nonelastic bond in a rotor can be considered as an over - damped spring which models the influence of forcing and viscous damping .    however , the main renewal in this model is not the mechanism of how the energy is injected into the system , but how the energy is transfered upscale due to the strain - induced relative motions between the rotors in the sense of vortex thinning .",
    "the efficiency of the cascade in the rotor model is supported by the relatively fast demixing of the system as well as a kolmogorov constant of @xmath0 that is within the range of accepted values @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : first of all , we consider a decomposition of the vorticity field into localized vortices with different shapes in section [ dec ] . in section [ ans ]",
    ", we make an ansatz for the shapes which corresponds to an elliptical distribution of the vorticity and discuss the interaction of two vortices with like - signed circulation within the point vortex model , the gaussian vortex model and the elliptical model .",
    "it will explicitly be shown that the former two models do not lead to a relative motion between the vortices , and that the thinning mechanism is only taken into account by the elliptical model . a suitable forcing mechanism for the vorticity equation",
    "is introduced in section [ forcing ] and then used within our generalized vortex model , presented in section [ modelsection ] .",
    "as it is known from basic fluid dynamics , the vorticity @xmath1 only possesses one component in two - dimensional flows and obeys the evolution equation @xmath2 here , the advecting velocity field is determined by biot - savart s law according to @xmath3 we consider the two - dimensional vorticity equation in fourier space derived from equation ( [ omega ] ) in the appendix [ fourier - vorticity ] according to @xmath4 with @xmath5 $ ] .",

    "a striking analogy to this forcing mechanism can be found in the explanation of the magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "thereby , two elements of an electrically conduct- ing fluid that undergo a rotation around a fixed center are supposed to be connected by an elastic spring repre- senting the magnetic field . as a consequence",
    "the angular momentum of the system is not a conserved quantity anymore and the fluid motion becomes unstable .",
    "although , the introduced forcing mechanism is an ad - hoc forcing , it emerges in a physically plausible way from the basic equations of the elliptical model [ evolc ] and [ x_i ] .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned that the system of equations ( [ modelg1 ] ) can be obtained from the instanton equations of two - dimensional turbulence by means of a variational ansatz with gaussian elliptical vortices @xcite .",
    "as we have seen in section [ models ] about the interaction between two point vortices with equal circulation compared to the interaction between two elliptical vortices with equal circulation , the former model fails to describe a relative motion @xmath82 in the direction of @xmath73 . the thinning mechanism mentioned in @xcite",

    "1=    as it can be seen from fig .",

    "[ lattice ] .",
    "a fluctuating lattice of rotor clusters appears and after approximately 1500 rotor turnover times , the system forms a monopole which attracts the remaining rotors .",

    "this effect can be observed in the following spectra , too .",
