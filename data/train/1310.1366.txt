    "nowadays , scientific collaboration is understood as extremely valuable , as it integrates skills , knowledge , apparatus and resources , allows division of labor and the study of more difficult problems , including interdisciplinary ones .",
    "it also brings recognition and visibility and increases the network of contacts of the researchers involved @xcite .",
    "scientific collaboration is strongly correlated with production measured by publication output and other indexes in scientometrics @xcite , which has substantially contributed to raise the interest of the scientific community in studying itself over the last decades @xcite .",
    "more recently , due to the fast growth and enormous development of the complex network science @xcite the subject of scientific collaboration has been extensively studied under the framework of rather powerful and universal paradigms @xcite .",
    "the internet and the fact that traveling became substantially less costly have facilitated international collaborations .",
    "still , geographical constraints affect the dynamics of research @xcite .",
    "different countries have different funding policies and this impacts the publication outcome , which is correlated to collaboration . for a country to be above the world average number of citations",
    ", it must spend more than one hundred thousand us dollars per researcher per year @xcite . at the same time , scientists with more investment in their research projects collaborate more @xcite .",
    "the social nature of collaboration might be the cause for the big disparity in production and number of collaborators @xcite .",
    "inequalities in income ( pareto distribution @xcite ) and movie co - appearance @xcite are examples of social distributions , characterized by a power - law profile . for scientific collaborations ,",
    "such distributions also appear , as demonstrated by lotka @xcite , from the analysis of two empirical sets of publications data in natural sciences .",
    "although in lotka s analysis @xcite only the senior authorship has been considered , the obtained power - law was shown to be consistent with empirical bibliometric data taking all authors into account @xcite .",
    "the so called lotka s law therefore seems to be valid even in different fields than those originally considered @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that highly prolific authors were excluded in lotka s procedure due to the limited number of persons in the samples .",
    "these teeming researchers might lie outside the pure power - law distribution .",
    "considering that engaging in collaboration is a time consuming activity , the number of collaborators can not be arbitrarily large , i.e. , must be somehow limited .",
    "an exponential cutoff has then been suggested as a correction to fit the distribution of productivity @xcite .",
    "measuring the distributions of citations by city or country , a power - law distribution also arises @xcite , which indicates the presence of self - similarity in the science system @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the definition of research collaboration is problematic due to the subjective understanding of its essential ingredients @xcite .",
    "this can be avoided by considering as scientific collaboration , a research which resulted in a coauthored scientific paper .",
    "this approach , although traditional , is not free of criticism as there are fruitful and relevant collaborations which do not necessarily involve a publication .",
    "notwithstanding , there is evidence that division of labor of theoretical or experimental work is usually rewarded with a coauthorship @xcite .",
    "also , analysing coauthorship makes it feasible to study collaboration of a greater number of researchers as compared by interviewing each individual .    despite the numerous studies about scientific production , citations and collaborations found in the literature , it is difficult to compare these variables as the databases used in these studies are usually unrelated .",
    "another problem is the small number of samples , due to a low number of respondents in questionnaires or data used only from a specific journal . to analyse",
    "the big picture is paramount to work with a dense information database . here , we used data from lattes platform ( http://lattes.cnpq.br ) , an online database maintained by cnpq ( national council of technological and scientific development ) , a government agency that finances scientific research in brazil .",
    "it contains the curricula of almost all researchers in brazil and their collaborators abroad , as well as information concerning their research groups .",
    "the lattes curriculum became the standard national scientific curriculum in brazil , and compulsory for those requiring financial support from the brazilian government .",
    "the curricula present detailed information concerning the researcher , including , but not limited to , full name , gender , professional address , academic titles , field of expertise and list of papers .",
    "researchers are classified in 8 major fields : agricultural sciences ( agr ) , applied social sciences ( soc ) , biological sciences ( bio ) , exact and earth sciences ( exa ) , humanities ( hum ) , health sciences ( hea ) , engineering ( eng ) , linguistics and arts ( lin ) , and others ( oth ) .",
    "most information in the curriculum are provided by the researcher themselves , for example , their list of publications .    by using this database",
    ", we may overcome some of the limitations found by other authors @xcite .",
    "due to the lack of individual information of the researcher , the problem of author name disambiguation @xcite becomes relevant , when , for example , two or more authors share initials and surnames .",
    "this is not the case with the lattes platform , where coauthorship is unambiguous and detailed information about publications and researchers are made available by themselves . as a consequence , this type of data allows us to study scientific production and collaborations of individual researchers and correlations between fields of expertise .",
    "the collaboration networks were built based on data of approximately 2.7 million curricula downloaded in june 2012 from the lattes platform website .",
    "files were parsed to extract the name of the researcher , professional address and authored papers published in periodicals ( including title , year and number of coauthors in the paper ) .    due to possible typographical errors @xcite ,",
    "an approximate string matching was used to compare paper titles .",
    "we used damereau - levenshtein distance @xcite as the metric and compared papers of the same year and with the same number of authors starting with the same letter .",
    "papers differing by 10% or less of the maximum distance were considered to be the same paper . from these results",
    ", we built a bipartite network in which researchers are connected to papers .",
    "then it is possible to eliminate nodes ( researchers or papers ) from this network to study the behavior of the remaining structure .",
    "a collaboration network is constructed by assigning an edge with a specific weight to researchers having connections to the same paper in the bipartite network .",
    "we show , in fig . [",
    "fig : sample_net ] , a network construted from our data , using several filters , to illustrate variety of information available .",
    "the total collaboration network ( tcn ) includes 275,061 researchers , with 90.4% belonging to the largest component .",
    "the total number of identified papers written in collaboration is 623,984 , the number of collaborations is 1,095,871 and the network comprises all 8 major areas used by the brazilian agency cnpq to classify researchers . the fact that more than 90% of the network is connected is an interesting sign , which indicates that discoveries from a field can spread in the communities through interdisciplinary collaborations .",
    "the extracted papers have publication date extending for several decades . by analysing the growth of the network , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth ] ( left ) that the number of researchers ( @xmath0 ) as well as collaborations ( @xmath1 ) grew exponentially in the last three decades , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with @xmath4 in years .",
    "we also show that the number of collaborations increases superlinearly with the number of researchers in the network .",
    "this accelerated growth has been observed in collaboration networks @xcite and other types of empirical networks @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that the number of social contacts and total communication also scales superlinearly with city population size @xcite .",
    "sample network extracted from the collected data .",
    "we show links between researchers ( nodes ) who were granted a scholarship and working in fields of medicine in the state of so paulo .",
    "node size is proportional to the degree of the researcher in the whole database .",
    "researchers were grouped according to the year of thier first published paper .",
    "the first cohort ( dark blue ) comprises all researchers who published their first paper before 1975 .",
    "each subsequent one , in counterclockwise direction , comprises researchers who published within 5 years from the previous one , up to 2000 .",
    "the edges are directed , colored according to the most senior . ]",
    "left : number of researchers with published papers ( black circles ) and collaborations between them ( red stars ) present in the cumulative collaboration network .",
    "dashed lines are exponential fits in the form @xmath5 up to 2009 , seen as straight lines in the linear - log plot . the coefficient @xmath6 is shown in the picture for each curve .",
    "deviations of the 2012 data points from the exponential fit are due to the early acquisition of the curricula , in june of 2012 .",
    "right : superlinear scaling of the number of collaborations with the number of researchers .",
    "dashed line is a power - law fit in the form @xmath7 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 . ]    a commendable initiative of the brazilian government is to award scholarships to distinguished researchers among their peers . as a matter of fact , these scholarships correspond to a bonus payment in addition to their base salary . for comparison with the tcn , in table [ tab : resumo ]",
    "we show the basic statistical properties of a collaboration network built with only these researchers ( scholarship network , scn ) .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xcite , @xmath10 , measures the probability that two collaborators of a given researcher have papers in common ( forming a triangle in the graph ) .",
    "social networks are known to have high degree of clustering @xcite , which can be explained in terms of a hierarchical structure @xcite . here",
    "both networks display a high clustering coefficient but the average value for scn is about half of tcn .",
    "this difference reflects the higher position in the research groups of the researchers with scholarship .",
    "they are more likely to have contacts in other research groups , which means being less clustered .",
    "a relevant question which naturally arises is how the scientific productivity and collaboration statistics of researchers awarded with scholarships differ from regular researchers . studying our database , we find that researchers in the scn represent less than 5% of the researchers in the tcn but contribute with 20% of the production .",
    "they are in average more than five times more productive , as measured by publication output .",
    "also , scn is more cohesive than tcn , as measured by the size of the giant component . to determine whether these characteristics are cause or consequence of their scholarship is not our aim , but previous research on collaborations strategies indicate that those with higher grants are more likely to have more collaborators @xcite .",
    "the degree distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk - grant ] clearly corroborate this difference between groups .",
    "normalized distribution of the number of collaborators ( @xmath11 ) of researchers with scholarship ( blue stars ) , without ( black circles ) and for the tcn ( red triangles ) . the distribution for researchers with scholarship decreases slowly up to one hundred collaborators , although most of them still have a small number of collaborators .",
    "the higher proportion of researchers with high @xmath11 might reflect the cnpq policy of considering the proponent s participation in research groups , international immersion and human resources development to grant the scholarship . ]",
    ".[tab : resumo]statistics for the networks studied in this work . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : resumo2 ]    we therefore built collaboration networks including all researchers data from lattes platform as june 2012 , and found that the network has grown exponentially for the last three decades .",
    "the calculated values of the assortativity coefficient and the average nearest - neighbor degree indicate that the networks display assortative mixing , where researchers having high @xmath11 collaborate with others alike .",
    "our results show that these teeming researchers are more likely to have a scholarship and to produce more papers than researchers with low @xmath11 .",
    "the distribution @xmath12 is also approaching a power - law as the network gets older .",
    "finally , we confirmed the validity of lotka s law for researchers working on different states of brazil and found substantial correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "lotka s law is shown to be valid for different fields : indeed , @xmath15 and @xmath12 follow an universal behavior .",
