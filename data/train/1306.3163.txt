    "nonequilibrium phase transitions into absorbing states describe a large sort of phenomena including chemical reactions , disease spreading , competition between species , wetting processes , calcium dynamics and others @xcite . due the absence of equilibrium",
    "analogous , they are essential in the establishment of the main ingredients required for the emergence of phase transitions and critical behavior .    the contact process ( cp ) @xcite is probably the best example yielding an absorbing phase transition .",
    "particles are created catalytically , but are spontaneously annihilated .",
    "it presents a set of critical exponents belonging to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class .",
    "the dp conjecture @xcite embraces not only the cp , but also generic absorbing phase transitions with no extra symmetries and conservation laws .",
    "such examples are reaction - diffusion processes , cellular - automata models and even continuous descriptions with multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "more recently it has been observed experimentally in turbulent nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "differently from the continuous case , one - dimensional discontinuous absorbing transitions has been much less observed . except in special cases",
    "@xcite , its manifestation in short range systems have been the subject of a longstanding controversy @xcite .",
    "the absence of a discontinuous transition would stem from the suppression of compact clusters coming from the large fluctuations in one dimension . on the other hand , by increasing the dimensionality , the fluctuations are less relevant and the formation of compact clusters becomes possible .",
    "long - range interactions have been proposed like more realistic descriptions in different nonequilibrium phenomena , when compared with their short - range counterparts .",
    "some examples of systems presenting long - range interactions include wetting phenomena , spreading of diseases over long distances and others @xcite . as an effect of long - range interactions ,",
    "the absorbing transition may deviate from the original dp case and belong to the different universality classes @xcite .",
    "other remarkable difference concerns the possibility of stabilizing compact clusters in one dimension .",
    "ginelli et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the @xmath2contact process , in which particles are created and annihilated like the usual short - range cp , but the activation rate depends the length @xmath1 of the island of inactive sites according to expression @xmath0 .",
    "they found that for @xmath4 the interactions are effectively long - range and the phase transition becomes discontinuous . on the other hand , for @xmath5 the long - range parameter play not relevant role and",
    "the phase transition remains second - order ( similar to its short - range version ) .    despite the study of the @xmath2cp under different methodologies @xcite",
    "some aspects have not been addressed so far .",
    "is it present a first - order transition in the limit of extreme weak ( @xmath6 ) long - range interactions ? does the competition with short range interactions become the system still able to suppress fluctuations that destabilize compact clusters ? is the phase coexistence maintained by changing the interaction rules ?",
    "does the existence of infinitely absorbing states influence the order of transition ?    aiming to answer above queries , in this paper we investigate thoroughly a family of one - dimensional long - range contact models .",
    "first , we reconsider the @xmath2cp by weakening sufficiently the long - range interaction toward the short - range limit and further by introducing an effective competition with short - range interactions .",
    "although the emergence of a discontinuous transition is expected not depending on the parameter @xmath7 @xcite , a quite interesting point would concern the stabilization of compact clusters over extreme small long - range interactions ( thus close to the short - range regime ) .",
    "in such cases the long - range should act as a small ( but relevant ) perturbation .",
    "second , we consider the effect of different interaction rules , including creation and annihilation in the presence of clusters of particles ( instead of one particle case ) and infinitely many absorbing states .",
    "these models are long - range versions of the named pair - creation cp , pair - annihilation ( pam ) , triplet - annihilation models ( tam ) and the pair contact process ( pcp ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "all models will be studied over mean - field approximations and extensive numerical simulations in the constant rate ( ordinary ) @xcite and the constant particle number ( conserved ) ensembles @xcite .",
    "our results show that for all systems with a single absorbing state the occurrence of discontinuous transitions is held by decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "for the long - range pcp , on the other hand , different scenario are possible . by measuring the length @xmath1 between extreme pairs of particles ,",
    "the transition becomes first - order for low @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath1 is the distance between a pair and the nearest particle surrounding the inactive island , the transition is always continuous .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we described all methods , in sec .",
    "iii we present the models and numerical results and finally conclusions are showed in sec .",
    "the one - dimensional contact process is defined in a chain of @xmath8 sites where each site @xmath9 is attached by a two - state occupation variable @xmath10 reading @xmath11 or @xmath12 , according to whether it is empty or occupied , respectively .",
    "interaction rules are composed of creation and annihilation of particles , represented by transition rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "particles are created in empty active sites and are spontaneously annihilated .",
    "systems will be studied in the constant rate ( ordinary ) and in the constant particle number ( conserved ) ensembles @xcite . in the former case the control parameter ( the creation or annihilation rates )",
    "are held fixed but the total particle number @xmath15 fluctuates .",
    "it is described by the total transition rate @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the strength of the annihilation rate . for low @xmath18 ,",
    "phase is active , in which particles are continuously created and annihilated . by increasing @xmath18 ,",
    "a phase transition into an absorbing state takes place . except the pcp",
    ", the absorbing state is characterized by a full empty lattice . for the pcp ,",
    "any configuration devoid of pairs is absorbing .",
    "the transition point and the nature of transition can be precisely identified by performing spreading simulations @xcite .",
    "starting from an initial seed , it consists of determining the time evolution of appropriate quantities , such as the survival probability @xmath19 , the total number of particles @xmath20 and the mean square spreading @xmath21 .    at the emergence of phase transition",
    ", these quantities follow algebraic behaviors given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are their associated dynamic critical exponents . for second - order dp phase transitions",

    "thus , spreading simulations provides not only locating the transition point , but also to classify the order of transition . the change in the order of transition will be characterized by an alteration in the critical exponents . off the transition regime , above dynamic quantities deviate from the power law behaviors .    for systems with infinitely many absorbing states",
    "@xcite , spreading experiments become particularly hard to be used . in particular , the dynamic exponents @xmath23 and @xmath24 are strongly dependent on the initial conditions , presenting non - universal values @xcite .",
    "a simpler procedure for locating the critical point in such cases is to study the order - parameter decay starting from a fully occupied initial condition . unlike above exponents",
    ", @xmath31 does not depend on the initial configuration .",
    "one expects @xmath32 behaves as @xmath33 at the critical point , where @xmath34 .",
    "conversely , we should expect a non power - law behavior at a discontinuous transition .",
    "since alternative methods ( e.g hysteretic ones ) can not be used for systems with absorbing states , another strategy is required . in particular",
    ", we have calculated the probability distribution ( in the steady regime ) by considering different initial configurations .",
    "a bimodal distribution reveals the discontinuous transition .    in the constant rate ensemble ,",
    "the control parameter is the total particle number @xmath35 .",
    "particles are created as in the ordinary case , but instead of creating new particles , a cluster of @xmath36 sites leaves its place and jumps to @xmath36 active sites .",
    "one may define the conserved ensemble as a @xmath37-site process , in which creation and annihilation occurs simultaneously according to the following transition @xcite @xmath38 it has been shown @xcite that in the thermodynamic limit above dynamics is equivalent to that studied in the constant rate ensemble .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 fluctuates and is calculated through expression @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes a generic average evaluated over the conserved ensemble .",
    "an immediate advantage concerns its simplicity for locating the transition point . in this case , by considering the system constrained in the subcritical regime , e. g , a finite number of particles placed in an infinite lattice , the addition of particles drives the system toward the transition point @xmath42 according to the expression @xcite , @xmath43 thus , from the above , the transition point is obtained by a linear extrapolation in @xmath44 .",
    "other advantage refers the classification of the phase transition , obtained by measuring the particle structures for different @xmath35 . for second - order transitions ,",
    "the clusters are fractals @xcite , whereas they become compact in a discontinuous transition . being @xmath45 the mean distance of particles located at extremities of the system , we have that @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fractal dimension .",
    "for one - dimensional systems belonging to the dp universality class @xmath47 reads @xmath48 , whereas at the phase coexistence it is the proper euclidean dimension @xmath49 ( consistent to the existence of compact clusters ) .",
    "the above values are related with dynamic exponents through expression @xmath50 .",
    "before performing simulations we have analyzed the models by means of a cluster approximation at the level of two nearest neighbor sites @xcite . in this case , the system is described by the one - site probabilities @xmath51 and @xmath52 and the two - site probabilities @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath53 . however , only two of them are independent .",
    "the generic probability of a string of @xmath1 consecutive sites is approximated by @xmath56 by choosing @xmath57 and @xmath58 and taking account the translation invariance , their evolution equations read @xmath59 and @xmath60 where @xmath61 . by using the approximation ( [ pair ] ) ,",
    "we get a set of two closed equations for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . at the stationary state we found for all models studied a general structure in the relation for @xmath18 vs @xmath64 given by @xmath65 up to order @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a numerical constant and @xmath68 depends on the other parameters but not on @xmath18 . from this equation",
