    "quantum entanglement is one of the key features of quantum physics .",
    "the interest on quantum entanglement has dramatically increased during the last two decades due to the emerging field of quantum information theory .",
    "it turns out that quantum entangled states may be used as basic resources in quantum information processing and communication .",
    "the prominent examples are quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation , quantum error correction codes , and quantum computation .",
    "it is therefore clear that there is a considerable interest in efficient theoretical and experimental methods of entanglement analysis , classification and detection .",
    "there are several excellent review articles ( see for example @xcite by horodecki family and @xcite by ghne and toth ) and books @xcite dealing with quantum entanglement and quantum information .",
    "one of the essential problems in quantum entanglement theory is the classification of states of composite quantum systems . in particular",
    "it is of primary importance to test whether a given quantum state is separable or entangled .",
    "for low dimensional systems ( qubit - qubit or qubit - qitrit ) there exists a necessary and sufficient condition for separability for bipartite systems  the celebrated peres - horodecki criterion based on positivity of partial transposition .",
    "however , for higher dimensional systems , or more number of parties , there is no single universal separability condition .",
    "there are several theoretical and experimental tools enabling one to analyze and detect quantum entanglement .",
    "many authors contributed to a long list of various separability criteria and detection methods @xcite .",
    "the most general approach to characterize quantum entanglement uses a notion of an entanglement witness .",
    "the term _ entanglement witness _ for operators detecting quantum entangled states was introduced by terhal @xcite .",
    "one of the big advantages of entanglement witnesses is that they provide an economic method of detection which does need the full information about the quantum state .",
    "such information is usually obtained by the full state tomography . here",
    "one uses only the information about the mean value of some observable in a given quantum state .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that any entangled state can be detected by some entanglement witness and hence the knowledge of witnesses enables us to perform full classification of states of composite quantum systems .",
    "interestingly , entanglement witnesses are deeply connected to a theory of positive maps in operator algebras .",
    "positive maps play an important role both in physics and mathematics providing generalization of @xmath0-homomorphisms , jordan homomorphisms and conditional expectations . in the algebraic approach to quantum physics",
    "@xcite normalized positive maps define affine mappings between sets of states of @xmath1-algebras .",
    "the review is organized as follows : section [ s - states ] discusses the structure of states for bipartite quantum systems .",
    "we introduce the notion of schmidt number for an arbitrary bipartite positive operator and perform classification of quantum states",
    ". special role of separable states , states positive under partial transposition ( ppt ) , and so called edge states is emphasized .",
    "section [ s - ew ] provides basic definitions and properties of entanglement witnesses .",
    "we introduce the notion of a @xmath2-schmidt witnesses , ( in)decomposable and atomic witnesses and finally provide a general representation of an indecomposable entanglement witness based on the properties of edge states .",
    "section [ maps ] analyzes positive maps in operator algebras and discusses well known correspondence between linear maps and bipartite operators .",
    "hence , all properties of witnesses may be analyzed in the language of maps and vice versa .",
    "section [ sep - ew ] shows how well known separability criteria may be used for construction natural entanglement witnesses . in particular",
    "it is shows how bell inequalities may be connected to appropriate entanglement witnesses .",
    "section [ s - optimal ] introduces important notions of optimal , extremal and exposed witnesses .",
    "sections [ s - diag ] and [ s - opt ] illustrate introduced theoretical concepts with several well known examples : section [ s - diag ] analyzes the structure of so called diagonal - type entanglement witnesses for qudit - qudit systems . in particular",
    "it discusses witnesses constructed via generalization of the celebrated choi positive indecomposable map .",
    "section [ s - opt ] discusses generalization of another ` classical ' map constructed by robertson .",
    "remarkably , entanglement witnesses constructed this way are optimal and hence provide the strongest theoretical tool for detecting quantum entangled states . section [ circulant ] provides important construction of witnesses based on so called circulant decomposition of the hilbert space corresponding to composite system of two qudits .",
    "this class contains for example well known family of bell diagonal witnesses .",
    "section [ k ] shows how to construct @xmath2-schmidt witness and it is based on the spectral decomposition of the corresponding witness .",
    "this construction is up to now the most general one known in the literature . in section [ s - multi ] we show how to generalize the analysis of quantum states and entanglement witnesses to multipartite scenario . section [ s - cones ] may be treated as a completion of the paper .",
    "it shows how the geometry of convex cones enables one to present the structure and properties of entanglement witnesses in a unified elegant geometric way .",
    "let us introduce a basic notation used throughout the paper : we denote by @xmath3 a vector space of linear operators acting on a finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath4 . fixing a basis in @xmath4 one",
    "may identify @xmath3 with the space @xmath5 of @xmath6 complex matrices with @xmath7 .",
    "one endows @xmath3 with the hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath9 denotes an orthonormal basis in @xmath4 , then @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes an inner product in @xmath4 .",
    "this product gives rise to the hilbert - schmidt norm @xmath12 apart from @xmath13 the space @xmath3 is endowed with the standard operator norm @xmath14 and the trace norm @xmath15 if @xmath16 are eigenvalues of @xmath17 , then @xmath18 denote by @xmath19 a subspace of positive operators in @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath19 is no longer a vector space but it defines a convex cone in @xmath3 ( see section [ s - cones ] for details about convex cones ) .",
    "finally , mixed states represented by density operators give rise to compact convex set @xmath20 i.e. a set of normalized positive operators .",

    "now , for any vector @xmath28 one has the corresponding schmidt decomposition @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are two families of orthogonal normalized vectors in @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath35 is normalized , i.e. it corresponds to a pure state of a composite system living in @xmath36 , then @xmath37 are called schmidt coefficients of @xmath35 and they satisfy @xmath38 ^ 2 = 1 $ ] .",
    "one calls the number ` @xmath39 ' the schmidt rank @xmath40 of @xmath35 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath41 .",
    "a vector @xmath42 is separable iff @xmath43 , that is , @xmath44 , and entangled otherwise .",

    "note that @xmath36 and the vector space @xmath52 of linear operators @xmath53 have the same dimension and hence they are isomorphic .",
    "fixing an arbitrary orthonormal basis @xmath54 in @xmath55 let us introduce an isomorphism @xmath56 by @xmath57 the inverse map @xmath58 reads as follows : for any vector @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , one defines @xmath61 .",

    "it is no longer true for entangled ppt states : a convex combination of two entangled ppt states is clearly a ppt state but it needs not be entangled .",
    "an important construction of ppt entangled states is based on the following    if @xmath120 is a separable operator in @xmath36 , then there exists a set of product vector @xmath128 spanning the range of @xmath120 such that a set @xmath129 spans the range of @xmath130 .",
