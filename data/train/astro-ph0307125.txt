    "x - ray observations since the time of the _ einstein _ observatory have shown that early - type galaxies are often luminous x - ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", it is clear that the bulk of the x - ray luminosity is from hot ( @xmath10@xmath11 k ) interstellar gas . on the other hand ,",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations have resolved most of the x - ray emission in the x - ray - faint early - type galaxies into individual point - like sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given their properties and the stellar populations in these galaxies , these x - ray sources are assumed to be low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "lmxbs are also observed in _",
    "observations of x - ray - luminous early - type galaxies , and often dominate the x - ray emission at hard x - ray energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ chandra _ observations of early - type galaxies have shown that a significant fraction ( @xmath1020 - 70% ) of the lmxbs are associated with globular clusters in the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the fraction of lmxbs located in gcs is much higher than the fraction of optical light , which indicates that nondegenerate stars in gcs are much more likely ( by a factor of @xmath10300 ) to be donor stars in x - ray binaries than field stars .",
    "as has been known for a number of years , a similar result applies to our own galaxy and to the bulge of m31 @xcite .",
    "this is generally believed to result from stellar dynamical interactions in globular clusters , which can produce compact binary systems @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations with _ asca _ indicate that the total luminosity of lmxbs in early - type galaxies correlates better with the number of gcs than with the optical luminosity of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the correlation is consistent with the total x - ray luminosity of lmxbs being proportional to the number of gcs .",
    "this is somewhat surprising , as a nontrivial fraction ( @xmath12% ) of the lmxbs in most of the early - type galaxies observed so far with _",
    "chandra _ are not identified with gcs .",
    "this suggests that most ( perhaps all ? ) of the lmxbs in early - type galaxies were made in gcs @xcite .",
    "the field lmxbs might have been ejected from globular clusters by kick velocities resulting from supernovae , by stellar dynamical processes , or by the dissolution of the globular due to tidal effects . if this is true , then the field lmxbs are a useful record of the total globular cluster populations and of the history of globular cluster destruction in galaxies",
    ".    alternatively , if field lmxbs are not generally made in gcs , then one might expect field lmxbs and gc lmxbs to have different properties .",
    "presumably , the stars in field lmxbs are formed in binaries , and evolve independently ( i.e. , they are not affected by their environment ) . as evidenced by the high x - ray to optical ratio of gcs , lmxbs in gcs",
    "are strongly affected by dynamical interactions within the gc .",
    "for example , it has been argued that it is difficult for gcs to retain lmxbs with massive black holes ( bhs ) , which may be ejected by dynamical interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with the fact that there are presently no bh lmxbs identified with gcs in our own galaxy .",
    "thus , one might expect very luminous lmxbs to avoid gcs in early - type galaxies .",
    "one might also expect lmxbs in different gcs to be affected by differences in their gc environment .",
    "this might occur because of differences in the ages or metallicities of different gcs , which might affect the evolution of individual lmxbs .",
    "alternatively , differences in stellar densities would change the rates of stellar dynamical interactions .    in this paper ,",
    "we give a preliminary analysis of the correlations of gc lmxbs and non - gc lmxbs , and of the differences between x - ray gcs and non - x - ray gcs in early - type galaxies .",
    "this analysis should be viewed as preliminary because of the small size and incompleteness of the existing samples . at present , only a relatively small number of early - type galaxies have been observed with _",
    "chandra_. the spatial resolution of _ chandra _ is needed to separate lmxbs at the distance of the virgo cluster , where most of the nearby early - type galaxies are located .",
    "moreover , most of the galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ so far are x - ray bright galaxies . in these galaxies ,",
    "bright diffuse emission from hot gas makes it difficult to detect lmxbs near the center of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the optical samples of gcs also are incomplete .",
    "ground - based observations have difficulty in detecting gcs near the centers of early - type galaxies , where they are blended into the diffuse optical emission from the galaxy .",
    "thus , ground - based gc samples tend to be restricted to the outer parts of the galaxies , which is not where most of the lmxbs are located .",
    "also , ground - based observations do not generally resolve gcs at the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "thus , there is a significant chance that ground - based gcs detected in the outer parts of early - type galaxies may actually be foreground or background objects .",
    "gc observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) are greatly preferable , as the resolution of _ hst _ allows gcs to be detected in the inner regions of galaxies , and slightly resolves them .",
    "however , some of the galaxies with the best x - ray data have no _ hst _ gc observations ( e.g. , ngc  4697 ) . also , the field of view of a single wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) observation is smaller than the angular size of early - type galaxies at the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "multiple pointings with the wfpc2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or with the recently installed advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) may improve this situation .",
    "because the gc observations of most galaxies do not cover the entire galaxy , we will restrict our analysis to the lmxbs located in the regions covered by the gc sample .",
    "we will also restrict our discussion to the relative properties of gc lmxbs and non - gc lmxbs , and of x - ray gcs and non - x - ray gcs .",
    "hopefully , comparing the relative properties of these samples within the spatial regions they share should reduce most of the selection effects in these incomplete samples , particularly as the lmxbs were detected solely by their x - ray properties and the gc were detected solely by their optical properties . all other things being equal",
    ", there is no reason why a lmxb in a gc is any more or less detectable in the x - ray than a field lmxb .",

    "however , the gc samples are incomplete at the faint end , and the completeness limit differs significantly from galaxy to galaxy in our sample .",
    "although there is no obvious reason why this incompleteness would affect gcs with x - ray sources differently than those without lmxbs , this suggests caution in interpreting differences among faint gcs .",

    "@xcite found a similar effect in ngc  4472 .",

    "the optical luminosity gradient is certainly , at least in part , a selection effect , since it is harder to see faint gc near the center of the host galaxy .",
    "other selection effects might be introduced by differing absolute magnitude limits and differing radial coverage in each galaxy . in light of various selection effects in the raw data ( e.g. , the radial variation of incompleteness in the detection limits of gcs , which differs from galaxy to galaxy ) , and the radial variation in the intrinsic properties of gcs , such as the more spatially concentrated nature of red clusters with respect to the blue ones seen in most galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "crude statistical tests with this sample suggest that the radial variations due to selection effects and intrinsic properties might indeed be able to reproduce the observed radial gradient .",
    "we have studied the connection between lmxbs and gcs in a sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "ultimately , it is hoped that such studies may provide information on the origin and evolution of lmxbs , and on the evolution of gcs . in general , the fraction of lmxbs associated with globular clusters ( @xmath97 ) is much higher ( by factors of @xmath98 ) than the fraction of optical light in gcs .",
    "this result , which is also true for our galaxy , indicates that stellar dynamical interactions in globular clusters are very effective at producing compact binary systems @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that the fraction of lmxbs associated with globular clusters increases along the hubble sequence from spiral bulges to s0s to es to cds .",
    "the increase is a factor of @xmath106 . for some time",
    ", it has been known that the specific frequency of globular clusters ( the number per unit galaxy bulge optical luminosity ) also increases along the same sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by a similar factor .",
    "these two trends might suggest that there are two populations of lmxbs in early - type galactic systems : those formed in gcs , and those formed from field binary stars .",
    "the variation in the fraction of lmxbs in gcs might then result from the variation in the specific frequency of gcs .",
    "if the number of field lmxbs were proportional to the field optical luminosity in all galaxies , and the number of gc lmxbs were proportional to the number of gcs , one might expect the variation in the fraction of lmxbs in gcs with hubble type to be considerably smaller than the increase in the specific frequency of gcs , which is not really the case .",
    "however , variations in the field stellar populations from galaxy to galaxy might result in variations in the number of field lmxbs per optical luminosity .",
    "we note that observations suggest that the total number and x - ray luminosity of lmxbs in galaxies increase in proportion to the total number of gcs rather than the optical luminosity @xcite .",
    "this suggests that most or all lmxbs are formed in gcs @xcite , at least in the earlier type galaxies .",
    "then , the variation in the fraction seen in gcs today with galaxy type requires that a higher fraction of lmxbs have escaped from gcs in later type galaxies ( spiral bulges ) than earlier galaxies ( ges and cds ) .",
    "however , the fraction of lmxbs which would have escaped from gcs in later type galaxies would be rather large , and might be inconsistent with models for the destruction of gcs or the stellar dynamical escape of lmxbs .",
    "future tests with larger samples may allow us to determine what fraction of lmxbs are made in gcs versus the field , and might provide independent information on the rate of destruction of gcs in galaxies .    the fraction of globular clusters which contain x - ray sources appears to be roughly constant at @xmath1% in different galaxy types @xcite . because of possible incompleteness of the gc samples at the faint end and because the probability of a gc containing a lmxb correlates with its optical luminosity , it may be more useful to give the number of high luminosity lmxbs per optical luminosity of gcs . in our complete sample ,",
    "this value is about @xmath2 lmxbs per @xmath3 for @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ( 0.310 kev ) .",

    "the strongest trend which we have found is a correlation between the probability that a gc has an x - ray source and its optical luminosity .",

    "thus , this correlation does nt provide any direct information on the physics of the formation and evolution of lmxbs in gcs .",
    "it would be very useful to correlate the probability that a gc contains a lmxb with the stellar density in the cluster in order to test the role of stellar dynamical interactions .",
    "the stellar densities could be estimated from the optical magnitudes and sizes determined from _ hst _ observations .",
    "we find that lmxbs are more likely to be found in redder gcs , and that this trend is independent of the optical luminosity correlation .",
    "this seems to indicate that the evolution of x - ray binaries in gcs is affected either by the metallicity or age of the gc , with younger and/or more metal - rich gcs having more lmxbs .",
    "models for the evolution of lmxbs suggest that the population should vary with time after the formation of the stellar population @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the number of lmxbs would initially rise with time for @xmath10 1 gyr , which is set by the time scale for the secondaries in lmxbs to evolve .",
    "after this , the number of lmxbs should decline slowly with time as the number of pre - lmxb systems decreases and the existing lmxbs evolve into millisec pulsar binaries .",
    "given that the stellar populations in gcs are generally much older than 1 gyr , we should be in the latter phase of evolution .",
    "thus , a decline with age would not be unexpected .",
    "however , the arguments in @xcite apply to lmxbs formed from the isolated evolution of a population of initial binary stars ; in gcs , new tight binary systems can be produced by stellar dynamical interactions",
    ". this might reduce ( or even reverse ) the rate of decline of lmxbs with age .",
    "more detailed models for the evolution of the population of lmxbs in gcs would be very useful .",
    "the number of lmxbs might also depend on the metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "a correlation between metallicity and the presence of lmxbs is also seen in gcs in our galaxy and in m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". this might be due to the fact that higher metallicity stars are larger @xcite ; however , the direct effect of this on the evolution of lmxbs does not appear to be very strong ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "larger stellar sizes might also promote tidal captures to form lmxbs @xcite .",
    "alternatively , metallicity might affect the stellar initial mass function @xcite or have some other more complicated effect on the formation of lmxbs .",
    "there is no strong difference in the x - ray luminosities of gc and non - gc lmxbs in our sample .",
    "this disagrees with the result found by @xcite for the galaxy ngc  1399 , where the brightest lmxbs appeared to be positively correlated with gcs . on the other hand ,",
    "our result is consistent with the analysis of the sources in ngc  4472 by @xcite .",
    "there is a weak tendency for the brightest lmxbs , whose luminosities exceed the eddington luminosity for a 1.4 @xmath8 neutron star , to avoid gcs . that may indicate that black hole x - ray binaries are somewhat less likely to be found in gcs , as seems to be true in our galaxy .",
    "it may be difficult to retain massive bh binaries in gcs @xcite . in any case",
    ", there are some luminous lmxbs associated with gcs .",
    "if one assumes that these most luminous sources contain fairly massive bhs , it would appear that gcs can retain at least some massive bh binaries .",
    "there is no clear evidence that the x - ray spectra or variability of gc and non - gc x - ray sources differ .",
    "a much larger sample and repeated observations with _ chandra _ would give stronger limits on the differences in the spectra or variability .",
    "we also find no evidence for a significant difference in the spatial distribution of gc and non - gc lmxbs .",
    "there is some evidence that x - ray gcs are more likely to be found near the centers of the galaxies than non - x - ray gcs , but this seems to be mainly due to an anticorrelation of optical luminosity with radius in our sample , plus the correlation of lmxbs with the more optically luminous gcs .",
    "unfortunately , there are problems with the completeness of both the x - ray lmxb samples and optical gc samples . for the x - ray samples ,",
    "the biggest problem is probably that most of the galaxies observed by _",
    "chandra _ so far have been x - ray bright galaxies , where diffuse emission from hot gas makes it difficult to detect fainter lmxbs near the centers of the galaxies .",
    "hopefully , more observations of x - ray faint early - type galaxies will resolve this problem . repeated _",
    "chandra _ observations would also allow variability to be detected in more cases , and would allow fainter persistent sources to be detected in the combined exposure .",
    "the main limitation in the optical samples of gcs is that not all of the best galaxies have been studied with the _ hst _ , and the field of view of a single wfpc2 observation is smaller than the angular size of nearby early - type galaxies .",
