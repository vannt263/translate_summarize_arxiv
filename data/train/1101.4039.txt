    "we begin this work remebering the framework of the standard cosmological model : a homogeneous and isotropic universe whose evolution is best described by friedmann s equations that come from general relativity and whose main ingridients can be described by fluids whose characteristics are very similar to those we see in our universe .",
    "of course , the universe is not exactly homogeneous and isotropic but this standard model does give us a framework within which we can study the evolution of structure like the observed galaxies or clusters of galaxies from small fluctuations in the density of the early universe . in this model 4 per cent of the mass in the universe",
    "is in the baryons , 22 per cent is non - baryonic dark matter and the rest in some form of cosmological constant .",
    "another idea that has been around just a bit less than hundred years and in which many of the cosmological models are based in is that of an homogeneous and isotropic universe , although it has always been clear that this homogeneity and isotropy are only found until certain level .",
    "now we know that the anisotropies are very important and can grow as big as the large scale structure we see today .    nowadays",
    "the most accepted model in cosmology which explains the evolution of the universe is known as @xmath1cdm , because it has achieved some observations with outstanding success , like for example the fact that the cosmic microwave background can be explained in great detail and that it provides a framework within one can understand the large - scale isotropy of the universe and important characteristics on the origin , nature and evolution of density fluctuations which are believed to give rise to galaxies and other cosmic structure . there remain , however , certain problems at galactic scales , like the cusp profile of central densities in galactic halos , the over 500 substructures predicted by numerical simulations which are not found in observations , etc .. see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in the big bang model ,",
    "gravity plays an essential role , it collects the dark matter in concentrated regions called dark matter haloes. in the large dark matter haloes , the baryons are believed to be so dense as to radiate enough energy so they will collapse into galaxies and stars .",
    "the most massive haloes , hosts for the brightest galaxies , are formed in regions with the highest local mass density .",
    "less massive haloes , hosts for the less bright galaxies , appear in regions with low local densities , i.e , regions were the local density is not well defined , @xcite .",
    "these situations appear to be the same as in our extragalactic neighborhood , but still there are problems .",
    "observations point out to a better understanding of the theory beginning with the less occupied space called the local void , which contains just a few galaxies which are bigger than the expected .",
    "this problem would be solved , if the structure grew faster than it does in the standard theory , therefore filling the local void and giving rise to more matter in the surroundings , @xcite .",
    "another problem arises for the so called pure disk galaxies , which do not appear in numerical simulations of structure formation in the standard theory , because it is believed that their formation which is relatively slow began in the thick stellar bulges . again",
    "this problem would be solved for the early formation of structure .",
    "the incorporation of a new kind of dark matter , different from the one proposed by the @xmath1cdm model into the big bang theory holds out the possibility of resolving some of these issues .",
    "recent works have introduced a dynamic scalar field with a certain potential @xmath2 as a candidate to dark matter , although there is not yet an agreement for the correct form of the potential of the field .",
    "@xcite , and independently @xcite suggested bosonic dark matter ( sfdm ) as a model for galactic halos .",
    "another interesting work pointing this way was done by @xcite and independently by @xcite where they used a potential of the form @xmath3 to explain the core density problem for disc galaxy halos in the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "@xcite presented a model for the dark matter in spiral galaxies , in which they supposed that dark matter is a scalar field endowed with a scalar potential .",
    "several recent work have also suggested that sfdm can be composed of spin-0 bosons which give rise to bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , which at the same time can make up the galaxies we are observing in our universe .",
    "@xcite proposed that dark matter is composed of ultra / light scalar particles who are initially in the form of a bec . in their work @xcite used a bosonic dark matter model to explain the structure formation via high - resolution simulations , finally @xcite reviewed the key properties that may arise from the bosonic nature of sfdm models .",
    "the main objective of this work in difference with others is to introduce sfdm and assume that dark matter its itself a scalar field that involves an auto - interacting potential of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ev is the mass of the scalar field , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . with the mass @xmath6 ev and only one free parameter when",
    "@xmath7 is taken equals to zero , the sfdm model fits the following important features :    1 .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the density parameters of all the components of the universe , @xcite .",
    "2 .   the rotation curves of galaxies , @xcite , and the central density profile of lsb galaxies , @xcite , 3 .   with this mass ,",
    "the critical mass of collapse for a real scalar field is just @xmath8 , i.e. , the one observed in galactic haloes , @xcite .",
    "4 .   the central density profile of the dark matter is flat , @xcite . 5 .",
    "the scalar field has a natural cut off , thus the substructures in clusters of galaxies is avoided naturally . with a scalar field mass of @xmath9 ev",
    "the amount of substructures is compatible with the observed one , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the sfdm predicts galaxy formation earlier than the cold dark matter model , because they form bec at a critical temperature @xmath10 tev .",
    "so , if sfdm is right , this would imply that we have to see big galaxies at high redshifts . in order to do this ,",
    "we study the density fluctuations of the scalar field from a hydrodynamical point of view , this will give us some information about the energy density of dark matter halos necessary to obtain the observational results of large - scale structure . here",
    "we will give some tools that might be necessary for the study of the early formation of structure .",
    "in section [ fondo ] we analyse the analytical evolution of the sf , then in section [ fluct ] we treat the sf as a hydrodynamical fluid in order to study its evolution for the density contrast , in section [ results ] we compare our results with those obtained by the cdm model for the density contrast in the radiation dominated era just before recombination and finally we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we perform a transformation in order to solve the friedmann equations analytically with the approximation @xmath11 .",
    "the scalar field ( sf ) we deal with depends only on time , @xmath12 , and of course the background is only time dependent as well .",
    "we use the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric with scale factor @xmath13 .",
    "the background universe is composed only by sfdm ( @xmath14 ) endowed with a scalar potential .",
    "we begin by recalling the basic background equations . from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 for a scalar field , the scalar energy density @xmath16 and the scalar pressure @xmath17 are given by @xmath18 @xmath19 where the dots stand for the derivative with respect to the cosmological time and @xmath20 is kronecker s delta .",
    "thus , the equation of state ( eos ) for the scalar field is @xmath21 with @xmath22    notice that background scalar quantities have the subscript @xmath23 .",
    "now the following dimensionless variables are defined @xmath24 being @xmath25 and @xmath26 the hubble parameter . here",
    "we take the scalar potential as @xmath27 , where , @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the mass given in kilograms , and from now on we will use units where @xmath30 , then for the ultra - light boson particle we have that @xmath5 ev .    with these variables , the density parameter @xmath31 for the background @xmath23",
    "can be written as @xmath32 in addition , we may write the eos of the scalar field as @xmath33 since @xmath34 is a function of time , if its time average tends to zero , this would imply that @xmath35-dark matter can be able to mimic the eos for cdm , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now we express the sf , @xmath36 , in terms of the new variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath37 is constant in the background and @xmath39 will be the energy density of the fluid also in the background .",
    "so , our background field is proposed as @xmath40 where , @xmath41 and with this our sf in the background can be finally expressed as , @xmath42 with this we obtain @xmath43 ^ 2   \\label{backsf }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to simplify , observe that the uncertanty relation implies that @xmath44 , and for the background in the non - relativistic case the relation @xmath45 is satisfied .",
    "notice also that for the background we have that the density goes as @xmath46 but we also have that @xmath47 ev @xmath48 ev , so with these considerations at hand for the background , in ( [ backsf ] ) we have @xmath49    finally , substituting this last equation and equation ( [ tri ] ) into ( [ rhophi0 ] ) when taking @xmath50 , we obtain @xmath51=2\\frac{m^2}{\\hbar^2}\\hat{\\rho}_0 .",
    "\\label{trigo}\\ ] ]    comparing this result with ( [ eq : dens ] ) we have that the identity @xmath52 holds for the background , so comparing with ( [ trigo ] ) , @xmath53 @xmath54    we plot the evolution of the energies ( [ eq : cinet ] ) and ( [ eq : potencial ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where for the evolution we used the e - folding number @xmath55 defined as @xmath56 and the fact that @xmath57 in terms of the two analytic results ( [ eq : cinet ] ) and ( [ eq : potencial ] ) fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the kinetic and the potential energies of the scalar field .",
    "observe the excelent accordance with the numerical results in @xcite for the kinetic and potential energies of the background respectively .",
    "if dark matter is some kind of elemental particle with mass @xmath58 , then it would be about @xmath59 gev@xmath60 particles to follow in a single galaxy .    here",
    "we describe a model for the non - interacting matter such that : i ) it can describe it more as a field than as particles and ii ) we find a function that only depends on the three spatial coordinates and time .",
    "now a days it is known that our universe is not exactly isotropic and spatially homogeneous like the flrw metric describes .",
    "there exist small deviations from this model , and if we believe these deviations are small enough , they can be treated by the linear perturbation theory .",
    "then , if dark matter is composed of scalar particles with masses @xmath61 ev , the occupation numbers in galactic haloes are so big that the dark matter behaves as a classical field that obeys the klein - gordon equation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the dalambertian and we have set @xmath30 .    by definition , a perturbation done in any quantity ,",
    "is the difference between its value in some event in real space - time , and its corresponding value in the background .",
    "so , for example for the sf we have @xmath64 where the background is only time dependent , while the perturbations also depend on the space coordinates .",
    "similar cases apply for the metric ; @xmath65 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the scale factor @xmath66 depends on the conformal time , @xmath67 is a perturbation associated to the curvature and e is asociated to the expansion .",
    "we will work under the newtonian gauge , which is defined when @xmath68 .",
    "an advantage of using this gauge is that here the metric tensor @xmath69 is diagonal , and so the calculations become much easier",
    ". we will only work with scalar perturbations , vector and tensor perturbations are eliminated from the beginning , so that only scalar perturbations are taken into account .",
    "another advantage in using this gauge is that @xmath70 will play the role of the gravitational potential , this will help us to have a simpler physical interpretation , i.e. , both potentials @xmath70 and @xmath67 are then related .",
    "this metric has already been used in other works , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    for the perturbed klein - gordon",
    "where we have used equation ( [ pert ] ) and we have set @xmath71 , we have : @xmath72    the sf @xmath73 has very hard oscillations from the beginning , this oscillations are transmitted to the fluctuations which apparently seems to grow very fast and are too big .",
    "nevertheless , this behavior is not physical , because we only see the oscillations of the fields , but we can not see clearly the evolution of its density , @xcite . in order to drop out these oscillations , in what follows we perform two transformations .",
    "the first one changes the perturbed klein - gordon equation into a kind of schrdinger equation and the second transforms this last equation into a hydrodynamical system , where we can interpret the physical quantities easier and the observable quantities become much clear .",
    "now we express the perturbed sf @xmath74 in terms of the field @xmath75 , @xmath76 term which oscillates with a frequency proportional to @xmath29 and @xmath77 which would be proportional to a wave function of an ensamble of particles in the condensate . with this equation and",
    "the expresion for the potential of the scalar field , ( [ k - g ] ) transforms into @xmath78 where we have defined @xmath79 notice that this last equation could represent a kind of gross - pitaevskii equation in an expanding universe .",
    "the only modification of equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) in comparison to the schrdinger or the gross - pitaevskii equation is the scale factor @xmath80 associated to the co - moving spatial gradient and that the laplacian @xmath81 transforms into the d alambertian @xmath63 .    to explore the hydrodynamical nature of bosonic dark matter",
    ", we will use a modified fluid approach . then , to make the connection between the theory of the field and the condensates waves function , the field is proposed as , @xmath82 where @xmath75 will be the condensates wave function with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xcite .",
    "here we have separated @xmath75 into a real phase @xmath37 and a real amplitude @xmath85 and the condition @xmath86 is satisfied . from ( [ psi ] ) we have @xmath87 ^ 2\\nonumber\\\\     & -&\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2}(\\dot s / m)^2=0\\label{hidro1 }   \\label{hidro }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , taking the gradient of ( [ hidro1 ] ) then dividing by @xmath66 and using the definition @xmath88 we have , @xmath89 where in ( [ hidro1 ] ) @xmath90 and in ( [ eq:1 ] ) we have defined @xmath91 .",
    "it is worth noting that , to this moment this last set of equations do not involve any approximations with respect to equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) and can be used in linear and non - linear regimes .",
    "now , neglecting squared terms , second order time derivatives and products of time derivatives in this last set of equations we get , @xmath92 where the equation for the gravitational field is given by poisson s equation ( [ poisson ] ) . in these equations",
    "we have introduced @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 .",
    "equation ( [ vel ] ) shows the proportionality between the gradient of the phase and the velocity of the fluid .",
    "note that @xmath95 can represent the velocity field for the fluid and @xmath96 will be the particles density number within the fluid .",
    "also there exists an extra term of third order for the partial derivatives in the waves amplitude which goes as the gradient of @xmath97 , this term would result in a sort of quantum pressure that would act against gravity .",
    "we remain that @xmath70 represents the gravitational field .",
    "these two sets of equations ( [ navier ] ) and ( [ navier1 ] ) would be analogous to euler s equations of classical fluids , with the main difference that there exists a quantum part , which we will call @xmath98 and will be given by @xmath99 which can describe a force or a sort of negative quantum pressure .",
    "for equation ( [ navier ] ) we have that @xmath96 will represent the mass density or the particles density number of the fluid , where all the particles would have the same mass .",
    "finally , these equations describe the dynamics of a great number of non - interacting identical particles that manifest themselves in the form of a fluid , also equation ( [ schrodinger ] ) can describe a great number of non - interacting but self - interacting identical particles in the way of a bose gas , when the probability density is interpreted as the density number .",
    "now , these hydrodynamical equations are a set of complicated non - linear differential equations . to solve them",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a vecinity of total equilibrium .",
    "for this let @xmath39 be the mass density of the fluid in equilibrium , the average velocity @xmath100 will be taken as zero in equilibrium , so we will only have @xmath101 out of equilibrium .",
    "then , the matter in the universe will be considered as a hydrodynamical fluid inside an universe in expansion .",
    "this system will then evolve in this universe and later on they will collapse because of their gravitational attraction .    then from ( [ navier ] ) for the mass density of the fluid in equilibrium we have , @xmath102 with solutions of the form @xmath103 where as we know , in general if we have an equation of state of the form @xmath104 and consider cdm or dust as dark matter such that @xmath105 it holds that @xmath106 then , when the scale factor was small , the densities were necessarily bigger .",
    "now , the particles density number are inversely proportional to the volume , and must be proportional to @xmath107 , therefore the matter energy density will also be proportional to @xmath107 , result that is consistent with our expression ( [ back ] ) .",
    "now for the system out of equilibrium we have @xmath108 equations that are valid in a universe in expansion . in order to solve system ( [ outeq ] ) we look for solutions in the form of plane waves , for this the convenient ansatz goes as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the position vector and @xmath111 is a real wavevector which corresponds to a wavelength @xmath7 . if we substitute these ansatz in the set of equations ( [ outeq ] ) , we then have @xmath112 where we have defined the velocity @xmath113 to solve the system is convenient to rotate the coordinate system so that the propagation of the waves will be along the direction of one of the axes . for this",
    "we know that the velocity vector can be divided into longitudinal ( parallel to @xmath111 ) and transverse ( perpendicular to @xmath111 ) parts , so we have @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the vector perpendicular to the wave propagation vector @xmath116 . in terms of @xmath115 for equations ( [ eq1])-([modos ] ) we have @xmath117 in addition to an equation for @xmath115 , @xmath118 , with solutions @xmath119 with @xmath120 a constant of integration , i.e. , perpendicular modes to the wave vector are eliminated with the expansion of the universe .",
    "now , if we use the result ( [ back ] ) , then equation ( [ eq2 ] ) can be written as @xmath121    system ( [ eq2])-([lambda ] ) can be treated as in the case of a universe with no expansion , so combining the two equations and with the aid of ( [ lambda1 ] ) , we get @xmath122\\delta=0 ,     \\label{delta}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is defined as the density contrast",
    ". this will be a fundamental equation in the understanding of the evolution of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "first we will give a brief summary of the results for the @xmath1cdm model , this will enable us to make a direct comparison with our results .    for cdm the equation for the evolution of the density contrast",
    "is given by , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is defined as the sound velocity ( which in our case it is not ) .",
    "now lets analyze equation ( [ deltacdm ] ) at the beginning of the the matter dominated era a time just after the epoch of equality , and just before recombination when the radiation has cooled down and the photons do not interact with the electrons anymore , for a relativistic treatment see @xcite . in this era , @xmath126 , practically all the interesting fluctuation modes are well within the horizon , and the evolution of the perturbations can be well described within the newtonian analysis . at this time",
    ", matter behaves like dust with zero pressure .",
    "so we have @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 therefore @xmath130 .",
    "for equation ( [ deltacdm ] ) we have @xmath131    the solutions to this equation are of the form @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are integration constants , from this solution we can see that we have modes that will disappear as time goes by , and modes that grow proportionally to the expansion of the universe .",
    "this is an important result , because then the density contrast will grow proportionally to the expansion of the universe when this is dominated by matter .",
    "then , these fluctuations can maybe grow and give life to the galaxies , clusters of galaxies and all the large - scale structure we see now a days .",
    "now lets see what happens to the sfdm at this epoch ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the evolution of the perturbations in this case will be given by equation ( [ delta ] ) .",
    "in general we have that in equation ( [ delta ] ) the term @xmath135 is very small throughout the evolution of the pertubations ( @xmath136 for small @xmath111 ) , so it really does not have a significant contribution on its evolution .",
    "when the condition @xmath50 is taken we can have a bec that might be or might not be stable , if there exists stability the results of sfdm are consistent with those obtained from cdm ( in this case both equations ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ deltacdm ] ) are almost equal ) , the condition of stability for the bec in the sfdm case will come from the study of @xmath7 together with @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath137    as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the perturbations used for the @xmath1cdm model grow in a similar way for the sfdm model , when @xmath50 , in this case both perturbations can give birth to structures quite similar in size , and this will happen with all the fluctuations as long as @xmath111 is kept small .    when @xmath138 the results are quite different , so when discussing the evolution of the density perturbations , there are two different cases : i ) in the case of @xmath139 the amplitude of the density contrast tends to decrease as @xmath7 grows bigger and bigger away from zero until the amplitude of the density takes negative values ( around @xmath140 ) , telling us that this kind of fluctuations can not grow in time , and hence do not form a bec .",
    "ii ) on the other hand if @xmath141 the fluctuations for the density contrast alway grow despite their size , this results means either than the fluctuations grow and form a stable bec or than the density grows because it is collapsing into a single point and our bec might be unstable , the study of the stability of this fluctuations needs then to be studied with non - linear perturbation theory .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , in both figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the initial condition for @xmath142 goes as @xmath143 in accordance with the data obtained from wmap .",
    "if these fluctuations result stable and because they are big in size , this means that they can only give birth to large structures .",
    "these fluctuations can then help for the formation of large clusters or other large - scale structure in the universe at its early stages ( around @xmath126 ) .",
    "then , as these kind of sfdm can only interact with radiation in a gravitational form it is not limited by its interaction with radiation , and the dark matter halos can then create potential wells that will collapse early in time giving enough time for the structures to form .",
    "then if dm is some kind of sfdm , the luminous matter will follow the dm potentials giving birth to large - scale structure .",
    "the new observational instruments and telescopes until today have perceived objects as far as @xmath144 , @xcite .",
    "the cosmic background radiation can bring us information from @xmath145 to @xmath146 .",
    "but jet we can not see anything from the intermediate region , now we know of a possible galaxy that might be found at a distance of @xmath147 but it has jet to be confirmed .    as seen earlier , as expected for the cdm model we obtained that for the matter dominated era the low-@xmath111 modes grow , when cdm decouples from radiation in a time just before recombination it grows in a milder way than it does in the matter dominated era ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "although in general a scalar field is not a fluid , it can be treated as if it behaved like one.the evolution of its density can be the appropriate for the purpose of structure formation , because locations with a high density of dark matter can support the formation of galactic structure .    in this work",
    "we have assumed that there is only one component to the mass density , and that this component is given by the scalar field dark matter . in this case equation ( [ delta ] ) is valid for all sub - horizon sized perturbations in our non - relativistic specie , so for sub - horizon perturbations the newtonian treatment worked with in the evolution of the perturbations suffices .",
    "the sfdm has provided to be an alternative model for the dark matter nature of the universe .",
    "we have shown that the scalar field with an ultralight mass of @xmath148 ev simulates the behavior of cdm in a universe dominated by matter when @xmath50 , because in general in a matter dominated universe for low-@xmath111 , @xmath149 tends to be a very small quantity tending to zero , so from ( [ delta ] ) we can see that on this era we will have the cdm profile given by ( [ deltacdm ] ) , i.e. , the sfdm density contrast profile is very similar to that of the @xmath1cdm model , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . on the contrary for @xmath138",
    "both models have different behavior as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , results which show that linear fluctuations on the sfdm can grow in comparison with those of cdm , even at early times when the large - scale modes ( small @xmath111 ) have entered the horizon just after @xmath150 , when it has decoupled from radiation , so the amplitudes of the density contrast start to grow faster than those for cdm around @xmath151 . here an important point is that although cdm can grow it does so in a hierarchical way , while from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we can see that sfdm can have bigger fluctuations just before the @xmath1cdm model does , i.e. , it might be that no hierarchical model of structure formation is needed for sfdm and is expected that for the non - linear fluctuations the behaviour will be quite the same as soon as the scalar field condensates , in a very early epoch when the energy of the universe was about @xmath152 tev .",
    "these facts can be the crucial difference between both models .",
    "as mentioned before , recent observations have taken us to very early epochs in the origin of the universe , and have made us think that structure had already been formed , corresponding to @xmath153 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that at recombination @xmath154 there already existed defined perturbations in the energy density for the sfdm model , which can contribute to the early formation of structure . then",
    ", if clusters could be formed as early as these z s , this would imply that @xmath155 as a model for dark matter could give an explanation for the characteristic masses that are being observed , and therefore it could solve some of the problems present in the standard @xmath1cdm model .",
    "although the observational evidence seems to be in favor of some kind of cold dark matter , the last word has not been said .",
    "astronomers hope to send satellites that will detect the finest details of the cosmic background radiation , which will help us to get information of structure at the time of recombination , from which it will be possible to deduce its evolution until now a days .",

    "<S> the properties of nearby galaxies that can be observed in great detail suggest that a better theory rather than cold dark matter ( cdm ) would describe in a better way a mechanism by which matter is more rapidly gathered into large - scale structure such as galaxies and groups of galaxies . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we develop and simulate a hydrodynamical approach for the early formation of structure in the universe , this approach is based on the fact that dark matter is on the form of some kind of scalar field ( sf ) with a potential that goes as @xmath0 , we expect that the fluctuations coming from the sf will give us some information about the matter distribution we observe these days .    </S>",
