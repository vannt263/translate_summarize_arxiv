    "entanglement is one of the most peculiar features of quantum mechanics and it also plays the role of a fundamental resource in many applications of quantum information  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "entangled systems unavoidably interact with their environments causing decoherence and a loss of entanglement .",
    "since entanglement is by definition a nonlocal resource , one expects that any attempt to restore it must involve the use of nonlocal operations .",
    "we consider physical situations where two subsystems , for example two qubits , are prepared in an entangled state and subsequently decoupled  @xcite . due to the interaction with their local environment , entanglement dynamics may exhibit a non - monotonous behaviour , with the occurrence of revivals alternating to dark periods  @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "this phenomenon is due to the fact that entanglement is transferred to quantum environments , and then back - transferred to the system  @xcite . in other cases , the environment can be modelled as a classical system  @xcite and no entanglement between the system and the environment is established at any time . in the latter cases ,",
    "the occurrence of entanglement revivals may appear paradoxical , since the effect of the noise is analogous to a local operation on a subsystem .",
    "a first interpretation of this phenomenon has been given in terms of correlations present in a classical - quantum state of environments and qubits @xcite .",
    "in a recent work  @xcite , we have proposed to solve the apparent paradox by introducing the concept of _ hidden _ entanglement ( he ) , which measures the amount of entanglement that may be recovered without the help of any nonlocal operation . the definition of he is based on the quantum trajectory description of the system dynamics , that allows to point out the presence of entanglement in the system even if the density operator formalism does not reveal it : this entanglement is thus not accessible ( hidden ) due to the lack of classical information  @xcite .",
    "relevant examples of situations where the environment can be modelled as a classical system may be found in solid - state implementations of qubits .",
    "for example , in superconducting nanocircuits one of the most relevant sources of decoherence  @xcite are fluctuating background charges localized in the insulating materials surrounding superconducting islands  @xcite .",
    "each impurity produces a bistable fluctuation of the island polarization .",
    "the collective effect of an ensemble of these random telegraph processes , with a proper distribution of switching rates , gives rise to @xmath0-noise  @xcite routinely observed nanodevices  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we exploit the concept of hidden entanglement to explain the occurrence of entanglement revivals in a simple system . in particular , we consider two noninteracting qubits , one of them affected by a random telegraph noise at pure dephasing  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the hamiltonian model . in section [ sec : entanglement - dynamics ] we discuss the entanglement dynamics , showing that the revivals of entanglement are due to the presence of hidden entanglement . in section [ conclusions ]",

    "we consider two noninteracting qubits @xmath1 and @xmath2 , initially prepared in a pure maximally entangled state @xmath3 , evolving according to the hamiltonian ( @xmath4 ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 represents a random telegraph ( rt ) process @xmath9  @xcite acting on qubit @xmath1 .",

    "we shall exploit @xmath15 given by eq.([eq : densityoperator ] ) to analyze the two - qubit entanglement dynamics .",
    "to quantify the degree of entanglement of the system state @xmath15 we use the entanglement of formation @xmath38  @xcite that can be readily calculated by the formula @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the concurrence and @xmath41 . for the state @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : densityoperator ] ) we obtain @xmath42 , where @xmath33 is given in eq .",

    "it is worth to notice that the evolved state @xmath15 belongs to the hilbert space spanned by the bell states @xmath43 , therefore the entanglement of formation equals the entanglement cost  @xcite . in the strong coupling regime , @xmath44  @xcite entanglement revivals occur during the system dynamics  @xcite .      to understand the nature of this phenomenon we initally consider the limiting case of an extraordinarily slow rt process , @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "this regime physically describes situations where the stochastic process is slow enough to be considered static during the system time evolution lasting @xmath47 , i. e. we assume @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the evolution expressed by eq.([eq : densityoperator ] ) describes an average resulting from the collection of several time evolutions each lasting @xmath47 .",
    "the average includes the possibility that the rt process takes any of the two values @xmath49 or @xmath50 at time @xmath51 with equal probability . by a straightforward calculation",

    "[ fig : rt ] ) are not due to periodic entanglement death and rebirth by nonlocal operations .",
    "indeed , the hamiltonian evolution described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian1 ] ) only includes local operations .",
    "since local operations can not increase entanglement @xcite , its increase during the intervals @xmath63\\tilde{t}_n,{t}_n]$ ] must be attributed to the manifestation of quantum correlations that were already present at times @xmath64 , but were _ hidden _ , in the sense that the density operator formalism does not capture them .",
    "these correlations are evident in the quantum trajectory description of the system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the system evolution in fact results from averaging on only two possible quantum trajectories .",
    "the first trajectory corresponds to @xmath65 and the bloch vector of qubit @xmath1 rotates around its @xmath66-axis with frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the second trajectory orresponds to @xmath67 and the bloch vector of qubit @xmath1 rotates around the @xmath66-axis with a different frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the bloch vector of qubit @xmath2 instead rotates in both cases around its @xmath66-axis with frequency @xmath68 .",
    "thus , during the first trajectory the system state evolves , up to an irrelevant global phase factor , as @xmath69 while during the second trajectory the system evolves , apart from an irrelevant global phase factor , as @xmath70 the two quantum trajectories only differ by the fact that the basis states @xmath71 and @xmath72 they acquire the additional relative phase @xmath73 in the quantum superpositions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : state-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : state-2 ] ) .",
    "since the two quantum trajectory occur with equal probability , the system s state is described by the quantum ensemble @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the entanglement associated to the quantum ensemble @xmath76 can be suitably identified by its average entanglement given by  @xcite @xmath77 since both states @xmath78 and @xmath79 are maximally entangled at any time ( @xmath80 is the _ entropy of entanglement _",

    "( [ eq : average_entanglement ] ) and the entanglement of the corresponding density operator @xmath81 : @xmath82 the meaning of hidden entanglement is simple : it measures the entanglement that can not be exploited as a resource due to the lack of classical knowledge about which state in the ensemble @xmath76 we are dealing with .",
    "once this classical information is provided , the entanglement can be recovered .",
    "coming back to the interpretation of entanglement revivals , the ensemble description ( average entanglement @xmath83 ) tells us that at times @xmath64 the system is always in a maximally entangled state ( @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) but the lack of classical knowledge about which of the two states in the ensemble @xmath76 we are dealing with prevents us from distilling any entanglement : in fact , entanglement is _ hidden _ being @xmath86 and @xmath87 . at times",
    "@xmath88 this lack of knowledge is irrelevant since the random relative phase becomes meaningless at @xmath89 : all the initial entanglement is recovered , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we now investigate the case when the rt process evolves during the systen evolution time , i. e. we consider the regime @xmath92 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rt ] where we observe that the amplitude of revivals decreases as @xmath12 increases ( g decreases ) .",

    "the entanglement of formation assumes lower values with respect to the static noise case , @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , the amplitude of revivals does not reach anymore the initial maximum value .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in general , the action of the rt process during the time evolution makes the coherences of @xmath95 ( in the basis @xmath96 ) no longer in phase at times @xmath88 . in the time interval @xmath630,{t}_n]$ ]",
    "one or more transitions can occur between the two rt states , such that we can have a random extra phase at the times @xmath88 given by @xmath97 where @xmath55 is a non - negative integer .",
    "this unknown phase difference is responsible for the decay of the absolute values of coherences @xmath98 in the evolved two - qubit state @xmath99 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : densityoperator ] ) : if we knew the phase difference @xmath100 for each state @xmath101 , we would be able to restore the coherence absolute value to 1 , and therefore recover all the initial entanglement , by simply applying the unitary local operation @xmath102 . for completeness",
    "we point out , that the relative maxima of the entanglement of formation occur at @xmath103 , as one can derive from equation ( [ eq : coherence - decayfactor ] ) .",
    "notice that the amount of the decay of the amplitude of entanglement revivals is monotonously related to the normalized autocorrelation function of the symmetric rt process @xmath104  @xcite . indeed , as we have already mentioned , the reduction of the amplitude revivals is related to the transitions of the rt occurred in @xmath105 $ ] , whose mean number is @xmath106 . from a quantitative point of view , for @xmath107 the coherences decay factor eq .",

    "( [ eq : entanglement_formation ] ) .",
    "this clearly shows that the decay of the entanglement amplitude revivals is due to the decrease of the rt correlations , or in other words , to the memory loss of the stochastic process @xmath16 itself .",
    "in this paper we have exploited the concept of hidden entanglement to interpret the occurrence of entanglement revivals in a particular system where back - action from the environment is absent .",
    "namely , we have considered a system composed of two noninteracting qubits where one qubit is subject to random telegraph noise at pure dephasing . during the dynamics , entanglement vanishes and",
    "revives always `` remaining '' inside the system , as it is signalled by the average entanglement , @xmath112 at any time . at certain times @xmath113 this entanglement is completely hidden , in the sense that the entanglement of formation @xmath114 while the hidden entanglement @xmath115 . for this reason",
    ", the two - qubit entanglement can be simply recovered at subsequent times without the help of any nonlocal operation : in the considered case in fact the hamiltonian only involves local operations .",
    "finally we remark that the concept of hidden entanglement can be of practical relevance in solid - state devices , where dominant noise sources tipically have large amplitude components at low frequencies . in these systems entanglement revivals",
