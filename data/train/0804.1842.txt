    "the physical properties of gcss in galaxies have long been considered to be `` fossil records '' that contain vital information on galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , searle & zinn 1978 ; harris 1991 ; ashman & zepf 1998 ; west et al . 2004 ) .",
    "for example , the observed bimodal colour distributions , higher specific frequencies ( @xmath4 ) and higher fraction of metal - poor gcs ( mpcs ) in elliptical galaxies has motivated various formation scenarios for elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , ashman & zepf 1992 ; forbes et al . 1997 ; cte et al .",
    "correlations between physical properties of gcss and those of their host galaxies also have provided clues to the better understanding galaxy formation for example , strader et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that the mean colours of mpcs and mrcs correlate with the luminosity ( @xmath11 ) of their host galaxy . from a survey of virgo cluster early - type galaxies , peng et al .",
    "( 2006 , p06 ) calculated from g  z colours , the relations @xmath12}_{\\rm gc }   \\propto l^{0.16 \\pm 0.04}$ ] for mpcs and @xmath12}_{\\rm gc }   \\propto l^{0.26 \\pm 0.02}$ ] for mrcs .",
    "in addition to the above chemical property of gcss , the kinematical and structural properties of gcss have been investigated both for mpcs and mrcs ( kissler - patig & gebherdt 1998 ; cte et al .",
    "2001 ; rhode & zepf 2004 ; richtler et al . 2004",
    "peng et al . 2005 ; bergond et al . 2006 ; bridges et al .",

    "peng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the gcs in ngc 5128 has a significant amount of global rotation whereas richtler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) did not find any significant rotation in the gcs of ngc 1399 , which suggests a great diversity in the kinematics of gcss in early - type galaxies .",
    "the slopes of power - law density profiles of gcss are also observed to be diverse and only loosely correlated with the luminosity of their host galaxy ( e.g. , harris 1986 ; ashman & zepf 1998 ) .    in comparison with this remarkable progress in observational studies of gcss",
    "( brodie & strader 2006 ) , theoretical modeling has not been as well developed as to provide useful predictions that can be compared with the wide range of observations on gcs properties .",
    "this is mainly because , both _ subpc - scale _ formation processes of gcs in galaxies and _ kpc- and mpc - scales _ merging / interaction processes over a hubble time need to be modeled in a fully self - consistent manner in order that the gcs properties and gcs - host relations can be examined quantitatively .",
    "beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ; b02 ) first investigated the physical properties of gcss and their correlations with those of host galaxies based on a semi - analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation in a @xmath13cdm universe .",
    "b02 however could not discuss the structural and kinematical properties of gcss owing to the limitations of the adopted semi - analytic model .",
    "although previous collisionless n - body simulations with gcs have provided some reasonable explanations for the origin of structural and kinematical properties of gcss ( e.g. , bekki et al . 2005 ; bekki & forbes 2006 ) , they did not model the chemical properties of gcss .",
    "kravtsov & gnedin ( 2005 ) carried out a high resolution gas + n - body simulation of gc formation in a @xmath13cdm universe . in their model of a milky way like galaxy , gcs first formed at redshift @xmath1 12 with peak formation occurring at z @xmath1 4 .",
    "however they only simulated mpcs and only from formation to a redshift of 3 .",
    "thus no simulations have yet addressed the structural , kinematical , and chemical properties of gcss in a self - consistent cosmologically motivated simulation from formation to the current epoch .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate _ both the dynamical and chemical properties _ of gcss based on cosmological n - body simulations with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and thereby compare the results with the above - mentioned growing number of observational constraints on gcs - host relations .",
    "we focus particularly on the following physical properties of gcss in galaxies : ( i ) gc metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) , ( ii ) number fractions of mrcs ( @xmath14 ) , ( iii ) number fractions of gcs with bimodal mdfs ( @xmath15 ) , ( iv ) specific frequencies of gcs ( @xmath4 ) , ( v ) mean gcs metallicities ( @xmath12}$ ] ) , ( vi ) gcs half - number radii ( @xmath16 ) , and ( vii ) gcs velocity dispersions ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we mainly investigate correlations between these gcs properties and their host properties such as @xmath2 and hubble type . here",
    "we do not discuss other important observational results of gcss , such as the blue tilt ( e.g. , strader et al . 2006 ) or the gc luminosity function dependence on galaxy luminosities ( e.g. , jordn et al .",
    "some of these aspects have been already discussed in our previous papers ( e.g. , bekki et al .",
    "2007a , b07 ) .",
    "here we also restrict our analysis to central galaxies and do not consider satellites in sub - halos .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in the next section we describe our numerical method of cosmological n - body simulations , semi - analytic model of galaxy formation , and formation model for gcs . in  3 , we present our numerical results on gcs properties in galaxies with different luminosities and hubble types . in  4 , we discuss our results of gcs - host relations in the context of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  5 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      previous observations have revealed that the @xmath4 of gcss depends on the hubble type and luminosity of the host galaxy ( e.g. , harris 1991 ; but see also spitler et al .",
    "2007 for an alternative view ) .",
    "although the observed trends of @xmath4 with galactic properties ( e.g. , the bimodality in the @xmath19 relation ) are well reproduced by b06 , other key observations of @xmath4 have not been discussed . in the present study",
    ", we have shown that ( i ) @xmath4 of gcss in luminous galaxies with @xmath20 mag are significantly higher in early - type ( e / s0 ) galaxies than late - type ( sp ) ones , ( ii ) s0s typically have higher @xmath4 than spirals , and ( iii ) low - luminous galaxies with @xmath21 mag have higher @xmath4 , regardless of their hubble types",
    ". these results are qualitatively consistent with previous observations by harris ( 1991 ) , forbes ( 2005 ) , and aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "so far we have not discussed the physical reasons for the above dependences of @xmath4 on galactic properties .",
    "19 shows that the mean values ( @xmath22 ) of virialization redshifts ( @xmath23 ) of galactic building blocks that form gcs are significantly higher in early - type galaxies with @xmath24 than in late - type ones .",
    "this means that gcfrs in building blocks of early - type galaxies are higher owing to their higher mass - densities with higher @xmath23 .",
    "because gcfrs depends strongly on @xmath23 through the term of @xmath25 ( see equation 6 ) the higher @xmath22 in early - type galaxies is one reason for the observed higher @xmath4 of their gcss .",
    "furthermore fig .",
    "19 shows that @xmath22 is higher in more luminous galaxies , which can explain why more luminous early - type galaxies with @xmath20 mag are more likely to have higher @xmath4 in comparison with less luminous ones with @xmath26 @xmath27 mag seen in fig . 12 .",
    "19 shows that low - luminosity galaxies do not have higher @xmath22 , which implies that higher @xmath4 in low - luminosity galaxies seen in fig .",
    "9 can not be understood in terms of @xmath22 .",
    "b06 suggested that the origin of the observed higher @xmath4 in low - luminosity galaxies is due to higher mass - to - light - ratios ( @xmath28 ) of these galaxies .",
    "20 shows that @xmath29 steeply depends on luminosity in the sense that @xmath30 is higher in less luminous galaxies .",
    "given that gc numbers per unit halo mass ( @xmath18 ) in galaxies only weakly depend on the halo masses of the galaxy ( b06 ; see also fig.13 in the present paper ) , the above result implies that the higher @xmath4 in low - luminosity galaxies are due mainly to their higher @xmath29 ratios owing to the relation @xmath31 .",
    "although b02 predicted that the mean colours of both mpcs and mrcs only weakly correlate with the total luminosities of their host galaxies , these predictions are inconsistent with latest observations by strader et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and p06 .",
    "the present model has successfully reproduced reasonably well , the observed @xmath12 } - m_{\\rm b}$ ] relations for mrcs and all gcs . the derived slope in the @xmath12 } - m_{\\rm b}$ ] relation for mpcs in the present model is , however , not consistent with the observed one .",
    "the differences between b02 and the present study are caused by the differences in the adopted models of gc formation between these two studies .",
    "thus more sophisticated models of gc formation in galaxies at high @xmath32 need to be developed so that all three @xmath12 } - m_{\\rm b}$ ] relations ( mpcs , mrcs , and all gcs ) can successfully reproduce the observations .",
    "b07 showed that if @xmath33 , the observed @xmath34 } - m_{\\rm b}$ ] relation for mpcs is better reproduced .",
    "however the simulated @xmath35 ( i.e. , the formation efficiency of gcs ) in the model with @xmath36 in the present study is too small ( @xmath37 ) to be consistent with the observed one by mclaughlin ( 1999 ) .",
    "the present model seems to have difficulties in explaining self - consistently both the observed @xmath12 } - m_{\\rm b}$ ] relation for mpcs and @xmath35 .",
    "one possible way to solve this problem would be to investigate models with higher @xmath38 ( = @xmath39 ) in which @xmath40 depends more strongly on @xmath32 than in the present model so enough gcs can be formed at @xmath41 .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether the models with higher @xmath38 and @xmath40 can reproduce other key observations such as the @xmath42 relation .",
    "although we have so far presented variously different physical properties of gcss in galaxies , only some of them can be directly compared with observations : for example , the simulated @xmath43 relation can be compared with observations by p06 whereas the simulated @xmath44 one can not owing to the lack of observational data .",
    "it is , however , important to check whether the simulated properties are consistent with the corresponding observations . in table 5",
    "we summarise what we regard as the relative successes and failures of the current model in a qualitative sense . for any given physical property",
    "there are subtle , and sometimes large , differences between the observational data and the corresponding property predicted by the model .",
    "the references of these observational properties are already given in the introduction section  1 ( e.g. , brodie & strader 2006 ) and some of the observational data are presented within figures of this paper .",
    "less consistent results ( e.g. , the @xmath45}$ ] relation for mpcs ) imply that a more sophisticated model for gc formation would be required for more successful modeling .",
    "we have investigated the structural , kinematical , and chemical properties of globular cluster systems ( gcss ) in galaxies in a self - consistent manner based on high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations combined with a semi - analytic model of galaxy and globular cluster ( gc ) formation .",
    "we have adopted a number of assumptions on formation efficiencies of gcs which depend on the physical properties of their host galaxies ( e.g. , gas mass fraction ) .",
    "we investigated correlations between physical properties of gcss and those of their host galaxies for @xmath0 simulated central halo galaxies for mpcs with @xmath12 } < -1 $ ] and mrcs with @xmath12 } \\ge -1 $ ] .",
    "we find : ( 1 ) the majority ( @xmath1 90% ) of gcs currently in halos of galaxies are formed in low - mass galaxies at @xmath46 with mean formation redshifts of mpcs and mrcs being 5.7 and 4.3 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to 12.7 and 12.3 gyrs in lookback time .",
    "the majority of mpcs are formed in low - mass galaxies that are virialized well before reionization ( @xmath47 ) and thus have higher mass densities .",
    "mrcs are formed slightly later not only within high @xmath32 major mergers between high - density galaxies but also within gas - rich isolated ones .",
    "\\(2 ) about 50 % of galaxies with gcs show clear bimodalities in their mdfs , though less luminous galaxies with @xmath2 fainter than @xmath3 are much less likely to show the bimodalities owing to no or few mrcs .",
    "the age differences between mpcs and mrcs are quite small ( @xmath48 1 gyr ) in most galaxies .",
    "the origin of the simulated bimodality in mdfs is due to strong dependences of gcfe on @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( i.e. , higher gcfe in more gas - rich high - z galaxies and in mergers with larger mass ratios of the merging two galaxies ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the number fractions of mrcs ( @xmath14 ) range from 0 to almost 1 with an average of @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath14 in galaxies does not depend on their hubble type ( i.e. , bulge - to - disk - ratios ) , which implies that the formation of mrcs is not necessarily associated with bulge formation .",
    "the @xmath14 are likely to be smaller for less luminous galaxies .",
    "\\(4 ) the @xmath4 of gcss are typically higher in ellipticals than in spirals , and in low - luminosity galaxies with @xmath52 regardless of their hubble types .",
    "the mean @xmath4 for sp , s0 , and e populations are 1.8 , 2.0 , and 4.0 , respectively .",
    "\\(5 ) the number of gcs per halo mass ( @xmath18 ) does not depend as strongly on the luminosity or the hubble type of the host galaxy as @xmath4 does , which suggests that the gc number per unit mass is similar between different galaxies .",
    "@xmath18 is , however , likely to be higher in luminous ellipticals with @xmath53 .",
    "\\(6 ) although there are no significant differences in @xmath18 between spirals and s0s for luminous galaxies ( @xmath54 ) , s0s are more likely to have higher @xmath18 than spirals for less luminous galaxies with @xmath55 .",
    "these results suggest that only luminous s0s with moderately high @xmath4 can be transformed spirals via truncation of star formation and the resultant disk fading , because @xmath18 does not change during disk fading .",
    "\\(7 ) the mean metallicities of gcs ( [ fe / h ] ) for mpcs and mrcs depend on @xmath2 of their host galaxies such that they are higher in more luminous galaxies , though the dependence for mpcs is weak .",
    "although the observed correlation of @xmath45}$ ] for mrcs can be well reproduced by the present model , that for mpcs is not consistent with the simulated one .",
    "the observed correlation between the mean metallicities of all gcs and @xmath2 can be well reproduced by the present model .",
    "\\(8 ) spatial distributions of mrcs are more compact than those of mpcs with @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57 depends strongly on halo mass @xmath9 such that @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) which implies that @xmath57 can be used for estimating the total masses of dark matter halos .",
    "\\(9 ) there is no significant difference in velocity dispersion between mpcs and mrcs .",
    "velocity dispersions are larger in more luminous galaxies both for mpcs and mrcs regardless of their hubble types .",
    "\\(10 ) the physical properties of gcss such as mdfs , @xmath14 , @xmath4 , and @xmath18 are quite diverse between different galaxies , depending on the virialization redshifts of their building blocks and subsequent merging , star formation , and chemical evolution histories of the building blocks .",

    "it should be stressed here that although building blocks of g2 are virialized before @xmath67 , intensive gc formation happens around @xmath68 .",

    "a5 shows that the mdfs in spirals embedded in dark matter halos with different halos masses have variously different mdfs : spirals labeled as ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( j ) show remarkably strong peaks for mpcs owing to a larger lumber of mpcs whereas those labeled as ( b ) , ( e ) , ( h ) , and ( i ) show clearly multiple ( triple ) peaks in mdfs .",
    "spirals labeled as ( f ) and ( l ) can be considered to be showing clearly bimodal mdfs in their gcss .",
    "the relative contributions of mrcs to mdfs are clearly different between different gcss in these 16 spirals . fig .",
    "a6 shows that mdfs in ellipticals embedded in dark matter halos with different halos masses have variously different mdfs : a larger number of gcss appear to have bimodal mdfs in ellipticals than in spirals .",
    "these diversities in the shapes of mdfs in galaxies with different luminosities and hubble types reflect the diversities in merging and star formation histories between the galaxies .",
    "we ran models with different @xmath70 and @xmath71 in order to more clearly understand the origin of the bimodal mdfs seen in the present simulation .",
    "b1 shows the mdf of the galaxy g1 ( shown in figs .",
    "a1 and a2 ) for the model with @xmath72 ( i.e , five times larger than that used in the model described in the main text ) and @xmath73 . for this model with very weak dependence of gcfr on @xmath50 owing to a larger value of @xmath70 , strong enhancement in gcfr during major merging can not happen .",
    "the mdf , which can be compared with that in fig .",
    "a1 , does not clearly show the metal - rich peak .",
    "this means that strong enhancement in the gcfr during violent merging is important for the appearance of bimodality .",
    "b2 shows the mdf of g1 for the model with @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( i.e. , five times larger than that used in the model described in the main text ) . for this model with very weak dependence of gcfr on @xmath49 , strong enhancement in gcfr during gas - rich phases ( thus mostly at high - redshifts ) can not happen .",
    "although the metal - poor peak can be barely seen , the bimodal mdf in this model becomes much less significant than that in the model shown in fig .",
    "this result suggests that strong enhancement of the gcfr in gas - rich phases of galaxies ( thus at high - redshifts ) can be also important for the formation of the bimodality .",
    "since we assume that galaxies with higher @xmath23 have higher surface mass densities , stronger enhancement of gcfr in more gas - rich galaxies at higher @xmath32 means high gcfr in galaxies with higher surface densities of gas .",
    "these results thus suggest that the origin of the bimodality can result from stronger enhancement of the gcfr in more violent merging and and more gas - rich ( and higher surface gas density ) galactic building blocks .    as shown in fig .",
    "8 and a6 , not all of the simulated gcss have bimodal mdfs .",
    "it is therefore important to clarify the reasons why these gcss do not have bimodal mdfs . by investigating both mdfs and star formation histories ( sfrs ) in galaxies having gcss without bimodality , we find that most of gcss without bimodality either show only metal - poor peaks or show only metal - rich ones owing to very strong enhancement of the gcfr during single burst epochs of gc formation .",
    "fig . b3 and b4 show the sfh and the mdf , respectively , for the galaxy g3 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "owing to the very strong burst of gc formation during late major merging around @xmath78 for this galaxy g3 , too many metal - rich gcs can be formed .",
    "this galaxy does not experience strong enhancement of the gcfr before @xmath67 so that the metal - poor peak in the mdf is not clear . as a result of these , g3 does not show the bimodality in the gcs .",
    "g3 is the representative case for galaxies which do not show the bimodality in their gcss owing to the too many metal - rich gcs .",
    "other galaxies having gcss without the bimodality ( which are mostly less - luminous systems ) do not have metal - rich peaks owing to the lack of strong enhancement of gcfr later in their evolution .",
    "the galaxy labeled as ( j ) with no strong metal - rich peak in fig .",
    "a6 is a good example of such galaxies ."
