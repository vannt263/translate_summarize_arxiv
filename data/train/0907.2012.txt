    "galactic scale outflows ( galactic winds ) from galactic disks are common phenomena in the universe : they are found both in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in high - z galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "their main sources of energy are stellar winds , supernovae , or active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . their asymmetric and complex structures ( e.g. , m82 ; @xcite , ngc 253 ; @xcite ) are investigated by numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "galactic winds are considered to impact on galaxies and their environments .",
    "@xcite takes galaxy - scale outflows into their semi - analytical model of galaxy formation as a parameter , which reproduces the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity functions of ly@xmath0 emitters in high - z .",
    "recently , @xcite has suggested from their multi - wavelength observation data that galactic winds may carry away interstellar gas in host galaxies and may quench star formation .",
    "galactic winds from dwarf galaxies with gas masses of a few @xmath3 are suggested to be the major pollutants of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) through an analytical / numerical model @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , in reviews of the galactic winds , summarize the properties and significance of galactic winds .",
    "despite the importance of galactic winds , there are few galaxies where the basic physical values ( e.g. , mass and kinetic energy ) of the galactic winds were derived from spatially resolved data .",
    "it is important to analyse spatially resolved data because galactic winds have extremely complex structures : e.g. , non - axisymmetry about the minor axis of a galactic disk is found in m82 @xcite and ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "the fabry - perot interferometer , which enables us to subtract the continuum precisely and to produce pure line images , is a powerful method to observe galactic winds .",
    "the galactic winds in m82 @xcite and ngc 1482 @xcite were observed with fabry - perot instruments , and their masses , kinetic energies , and excitation sources of them were estimated from the [ ] @xmath16583/h@xmath0 line ratio maps . in spite of the fact that this method is especially effective , there were only three examples where the properties of galactic winds in edge - on galaxies were discussed in detail from line ratio maps .",
    "ngc 253 is one of the most famous galaxies because it is a nearby ( d=3.5 mpc : * ? ? ?",

    "we have observed the central region of ngc 253 with the fabry - perot(fp ) mode of the kyoto tridimensional spectrograph ii mounted on the subaru telescope .",
    "the kyoto3dii is a unique instrument that enables us to carry out the optical fabry - perot observations on an 8-meter class telescope and to observe weak emission lines .",
    "the observations were carried out during the test observations of the kyoto3dii , and this is the first result of the kyoto3dii fp mode . from these data , we have obtained the [ ] @xmath16583/h@xmath0 , [ ] @xmath26716,6731/h@xmath0 , and [ ] / [ ] line ratio maps .",
    "this unique set of line ratio maps allows us to clearly distinguish between shocked gas regions and starburst regions , to determine the extent of galactic wind as well as its mass and kinetic energy , and to discover regions with enhanced nitrogen abundance .",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction in section [ sec : obs ] .",

    "this mode uses an et50 etalon made by queensgate instruments .",
    "the field of view is @xmath4 1.9 @xmath5 1.9 , with the spatial sampling of 0.112 after 2 @xmath5 2 on - chip binning .",
    "the spatial resolution was 1.0 and the spectral resolution was 21  .",
    "for each of the h@xmath0+[]@xmath26548,6583 and [ ] @xmath26716,6731 sets , we obtained 5 on - band frames and 1 off - band frame .",
    "the central wavelengths of the transmission curve of etalon for the h@xmath0 + [ ] set were 6556  , 6568  , 6580  , 6592  , 6604 (on - band ) , and 6502 (off - band ) , while those of the [ ] @xmath26716,6731 set were 6717  , 6729  , 6741  , 6754  , 6766 (on - band ) , and 6650 (off - band ) .",

    "flat and standard star frames were not obtained at all the observed wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we have used the flat frames of the nearest wavelength for the flat fielding and the interpolated data for the flux calibration .",
    "the flat flames in 6502  , 6568  , and 6650   were similar to each other : @xmath4 20 % brighter at the frame center compared with at the edge .",
    "the flat flames in longer wavelengths , including in 6729  , 6742  , 6749  , and 6757  , had a different flat pattern : darker at the frame center . in the longest wavelength",
    ", it was @xmath4 30 % darker at the center .",
    "the resultant uncertainty caused by the flat fielding , including the interpolation , is negligible in shorter wavelengths , and within a few percent in longer wavelengths .",
    "we have removed cosmic rays , matched the spatial resolution to the worst frame , and subtracted the off - band frames from the on - band frames .",
    "eventually , the frames including only emission lines were obtained .",
    "the sky subtraction has not been performed in each frame because objects are observed in the whole field of view .",
    "this affects the continuum image , but does not affect the line images because the sky emission has been subtracted through the process of the off - band subtraction .",

    "the residual ratios were calculated by dividing the total residuals by the total flux of the h@xmath0 plus [ nii]@xmath26548,6583 , and they were 5% and 30% in good and poor examples , respectively . in poor fitting , line decomposing may be inaccurate , and the flux ratio may have a large error .",
    "however , the fraction of poor examples was smaller than 1/100 , and much smaller in the regions we discuss below , and we neglected them .",
    "the average residual ratio for a single pixel in the discussed regions was 15% .",
    "as free parameters , we took the fluxes of the h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath16583 in the h@xmath0 + [ ] set , and those of the [ ] @xmath16716 and [ ] @xmath16731 in the [ ] set .",
    "we assumed that the flux of the [ ] @xmath16548 was one third of that of the [ ] @xmath16583 .",
    "for the fitting , we fixed the velocity center so that it corresponded to the heliocentric velocity of ngc 253 of 251 km s@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we also fixed the intrinsic velocity dispersion as zero because it was much smaller than the instrumental profile .",
    "the main source of the uncertainties for the line ratio maps is not flux calibration but line fitting , because the sky transmittance was stable during the observation for ngc 253 . in order to estimate the uncertainties of the fitting ,",
    "we considered pseudo - observation data : they were obtained with the same `` observing '' parameters as actual observations from the spectra which include maximum velocity variation , velocity dispersion , and line - splitting observed in slit - spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties were estimated from the difference between the ratio derived from the fitting and the input intrinsic ratio .",
    "the uncertainties of the [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 maps were smaller than 30% and 10% , respectively .",
    "the uncertainty of the absolute flux calibration was less than 20% , and the uncertainty of the h@xmath0 flux , including the line fitting , was 30% .",
    "as for the [ ] @xmath16716/[]@xmath16731 ratio , it can be largely affected by the velocity field .",

    "hereafter , we call the southwest one filament a and the southeast one filament b. we refer to these filamentary structures as `` filaments '' , although we consider that they are not filaments but actually are a part of conical outflow .",
    "the north - side features were also found in the h@xmath10 emission , but not in the h@xmath0 probably due to strong extinction .",
    "the positions of filamentary structures seen in the h@xmath0 and in the soft x - ray @xcite in the galactic wind are close to each other ( figures [ fig : panel - center ] ( h ) and [ fig : panel - whole ] ( b ) ) .",

    "a closer inspection , however , reveals that the x - ray filaments tend to exist where the h@xmath0 emissions are locally weak and tend to exist in inner regions compared with the h@xmath0 filaments : the separation between the h@xmath0 and the x - ray filaments is @xmath4 70 pc .",
    "this represents that the inner part of the galactic wind has a higher temperature than the outer part of it .",
    "this relation between the spatial distributions of the h@xmath0 and the x - ray has been found through our accurate positioning of these two maps ( cf .",

    "our data show fairly uniform distribution of the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio of @xmath4 0.25 over the whole region b including its three clumps .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio of filament c is similar to those of regions a and b , rather than those of the galactic wind or starburst regions a and b. therefore , this region is a star - forming region located on the same line of sight as an edge of the galactic wind although the region looks as if it is a part of the galactic wind . in figure",

    "the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios remain large outside of the filaments while the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios become smaller .",

    "the photoionization model by @xcite is more reliable , because they took into consideration stellar population .",
    "@xcite placed a theoretical upper limit for starburst models on the optical diagnostic diagrams ( their equation ( 5 ) and figure 16(a ) ) , which show that it is difficult to exceed 1.0 in the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio with starbursts even though they took into consideration the effects of the nitrogen enrichment .",
    "no combination of parameters , such as star formation history and ionization parameter , can generate a theoretical point above this fold .",
    "this limit is rather conservative , and @xcite placed a demarcation line at lower [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio from observational data .",
    "photoionization may somewhat contribute near the central region , where the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio is smaller than 1.0 .    according to the shock model calculated by @xcite , the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio reaches to 1.55 , in the case of the solar - abundance interstellar gas , the magnetic parameter @xmath20 of 2 @xmath21 g @xmath22 , which is the intermediate value among their models , and shock velocity of 500 km s@xmath6 .",

    "both the [ ] /h@xmath0 and the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios are larger in further positions from the galactic disk in filament b. this means that the shock velocity or the degree of contribution of photoionization varies among these positions .    we compare the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio of the galactic wind in ngc 253 with those in other galaxies",

    "nitrogen enrichment relative to oxygen in metal rich environment was found in a statistical work by @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen enrichment can easily explain the observed large [ ] /h@xmath0 as well as [ ] / [ ] ratio although distorted ionizing continuum , which mimicks the situation where neutral matter lies between the ionizing stars and the emission - line clouds @xcite , or shock may also increase the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio .",
    "nitrogen enrichment occurs in the following process ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are two kinds of elements produced in stars , i.e. , the primary element and the secondary element .",
    "the primary element , such as oxygen and sulfur , is produced from hydrogen and helium .",
    "the ratio of the produced amount of each element ( e.g. , sulfur to oxygen ) is constant and insensitive to the metallicity at the star birth . on the other hand the secondary element , such as nitrogen ,",
    "is produced also in the cno cycle , and is spread into the interstellar medium with the stellar wind . the produced amount increases with an increase in the metallicity at the star birth .",
    "therefore , in a metal rich environment , the ratio of the produced amount of nitrogen ( secondary element ) to that of sulfur ( primary element ) becomes larger , and the [ ] / [ ] ratio becomes large .",
    "the relationship between the [ ] / [ ] ratio and the metallicity of galaxies is found in sdss observations @xcite .    in the [ ] / [ ] ratio map ( figure [ fig : panel - center ] ( f ) ) , the [ ] / [ ] ratios of starburst regions a and b are larger than those of regions a and b and filament c. this indicates that starburst regions a and b have higher metallicity .",
    "the [ ] / [ ] ratios in the bright blob and spot i ( hereafter , we call it blob / spot region ) are the largest ( figure [ fig : nii - sii - bb ] ) , so that the degree of nitrogen enrichment is extremely high .",

    "* ) , the metallicity ( 12+log(o / h ) ) of blob / spot region is derived as 9.17 @xmath24 0.08 ( 1@xmath9 ) . using the relation between log(o / h ) and log(n / o )",
    "( figure 8 by @xcite ) , the log(n / o ) abundance of blob / spot region is estimated to be -0.50 @xmath24 0.13 ( 1@xmath9 ) . here",
    "the scatter in n / o to o / h in figure 8 by @xcite was estimated to be about 0.1 dex ( 1@xmath9 ) by eye - inspection .",
    "when we use the @xcite abundance set , whose log(n / o ) ratio is -0.88 , the n / o ratio of blob / spot region is about 2.4 times larger than the solar value .",
    "this value of 2.4 does not change even if we use the @xcite abundance set , because its n / o ratio is equal to that of the @xcite abundance set .",
    "this value is similar to that in the galactic wind ( section [ sec : filament - b ] ) , although it is difficult to estimate the abundance precisely . to explain this similarity , it is plausible that the gas of the galactic wind is chemically evolved in starburst regions and then is blown out .      in region",
    "b , three clumps are found in our h@xmath0 map .",
    "the northern and western clumps are on the spiral arm , while the southeastern one is not . soft x - ray ( 0.3 - 2.0 kev ) is detected around region b , including the three clumps ( figures [ fig : panel - center ] ( h ) and [ fig : panel - whole ] ( b ) ) .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to determine from only the h@xmath0 map whether the southeastern clump is a part of the galactic wind or an region on the galactic disk with an x - ray emitting gas accidentally located on the same line of sight .",
    "this issue is important when considering the structure of the galactic wind , i.e. , whether or not the tip of the galactic wind is cooled down enough to emit the h@xmath0 .",
    "although region b was observed and considered to be regions through a long - slit spectroscopy @xcite , the line ratio of each clump was not discussed . in our data , the southeastern clump , as well as the northern and the western ones ,",
    "have the same [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios as regions in nearby disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the equivalent widths of three clumps are similar : @xmath4 40   ( figure [ fig : panel - center ] ( g ) ) .",
    "consequently , we consider that the three clumps of region b are not a part of the galactic wind but are regions on the galactic disk .",
    "we derive the properties of the galactic wind , given that the region where the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio is greater than 1.0 ( or the [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio is greater than 0.5 ) is the galactic wind @xcite .",
    "first we estimate the h@xmath0 luminosity of the wind .",
    "when the [ ] /h@xmath0 criterion is used , the h@xmath0 flux of the galactic wind is equal to 1.6@xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath6 , and its h@xmath0 luminosity is 2.3@xmath16 erg s@xmath6 when 3.5 mpc is used as a distance to ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "when the [ ] /h@xmath0 criterion is used instead , the h@xmath0 flux is equal to 8.9@xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath6 and the h@xmath0 luminosity is 1.3@xmath25 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the [ ] /h@xmath0 criterion , because it is less affected by nitrogen enrichment ( section [ sec : filament - b ] , [ sec : n - enrich ] ) compared with the [ ] /h@xmath0 criterion . because the total h@xmath0+[]@xmath26548,6583 luminosity of ngc 253 is equal to 1.1@xmath26 erg s@xmath6 @xcite , the h@xmath0 luminosity of the galactic wind is only from 0.5% to 5% of the total luminosity .",
    "the actual fraction of the luminosity of the galactic wind may be even smaller , because extinction is not corrected in the above estimate although the central region of ngc 253 is heavily dusty ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , we estimate the mass of ionized gas in the galactic wind . from the [ ] @xmath16716/[]@xmath16731 ratio of 0.9 to 1.2 in the central region @xcite ,",
    "the electron density is estimated to be from 100 @xmath23 to 1000 @xmath23 @xcite . using the electron density of 100@xmath27 @xmath23 , where @xmath27 is normalized to 100 @xmath23 , and the recombination rate of h@xmath0 of 8.7@xmath28 @xmath29 s@xmath6 @xcite ,",
    "the h@xmath0 emitting gas mass of the galactic wind is estimated to be 8.6@xmath30 .",
    "we assumed that the northwest side of the galactic wind , which is not detected in our observations due to heavy extinction , actually exists as well as the southeast side of it ( section [ sec : image - flux ] ) .",
    "for simplicity , we assumed the symmetric shape of the galactic wind in order to roughly estimate the volume filling factor , although it is non - axisymmetric about the galactic minor axis .",
    "the assumed shape of the galactic wind is a truncated cone structure whose opening angle is 30@xmath31 and diameter of the base and slant height are 500 pc and 700 pc , respectively .",
    "these values are measured through the h@xmath0 map .",
    "then , the volume filling factor of the galactic wind is estimated to be 4.2 @xmath5 10@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the limb - brightening in the h@xmath0 and the x - ray ( section [ sec : image - flux ] ) and the small filling factor suggest that the galactic wind has a hollow structure .",
    "finally , using the outflow velocity of 390 km s@xmath6 @xcite , the kinetic energy of the galactic wind is estimated to be 1.3@xmath34 erg .",
    "the dynamical time scale @xmath35 derived from the length of the filament b ( @xmath4 700pc ) and the outflow velocity ( 390 km s@xmath6 ) is @xmath4 1.8 myr , and the kinetic energy is increased by 2.3@xmath36 erg s@xmath6 on average .    in order to consider whether the energy input from supernovae can supply the kinetic energy of the galactic wind",
    ", we estimate first the h@xmath0 luminosity of the bright blob , which is the brightest region in the central region of ngc 253 . because of heavy extinction in the central region of ngc 253",
    ", we have corrected the effect of extinction using the ratio of the h@xmath0 flux to the br@xmath37 flux @xcite .",
    "we assumed the intrinsic br@xmath37/h@xmath0 flux ratio of 9.80@xmath38 @xcite and the extinction law of a(6563)=0.79a@xmath39 and a(2.2@xmath21m)=0.15a@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux of the bright blob in 2aperture , which is the same as used by @xcite , is 5.5@xmath28 erg @xmath15 s@xmath6 , and a@xmath39 is estimated to 6.9 mag .",
    "the extinction - corrected h@xmath0 flux is 8.3@xmath40 erg @xmath15 s@xmath6 , and the h@xmath0 luminosity is 1.2@xmath41 erg s@xmath6 , which corresponds to the star formation rate of 0.096 @xmath42 yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "when we assume that the star formation rate of the bright blob is constant , the supplied kinetic energy through supernovae and stellar winds from this region in 1.8 myr ( @xmath43 ) is estimated to be 5.6@xmath44 erg ( starburst99 : * ? ? ?",
    "we assumed salpeter initial mass function @xcite , @xmath45=100@xmath42 and @xmath46=1@xmath42 as cut - off masses , metallicity z=0.020 , and that the galactic wind began to blow when the first supernova occurred in the bright blob ( 3.6 myr : figure 114 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the energy input from the bright blob is much greater than the kinetic energy of the galactic wind .",
    "this suggests that starbursts are the main energy source of the galactic wind in ngc 253 .",
    "we compare the properties of the galactic winds in m82 @xcite , ngc 1482 @xcite , and ngc 253 , although the definition of galactic wind regions in m82 is quite different from that in ngc 253 and ngc 1482",
    ". @xcite defined the galactic wind regions by simply excluding within approximately 8of the disk ( + halo component ) , while we and @xcite used the criterion of the [ ] /h@xmath0 and [ ] /h@xmath0 ratio , respectively .",
    "the kinetic energy of the galactic wind in ngc 253 ( 1.3@xmath44 erg ) is found to be smaller than those in m82 ( 2.1@xmath47 erg ) and in ngc 1482 ( 2@xmath44 erg ) .",
    "there are three possibilities for the difference in the energies of the galactic winds : the masses , the velocities , and the dynamical timescales .",
    "the mass in ngc 1482 is about 4.2 times , and the mass in m82 is about 67 times as large as that in ngc 253 ( 8.6@xmath48 ) .",
    "the outflow velocities and the dynamical timescales do not vary drastically among these galaxies : 390 km s@xmath6 and 1.8 myr in ngc 253 , 250 km s@xmath6 and 6 myr in ngc 1482 , and 600 km s@xmath6 and 3.4 myr in m82 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the difference of the outflow mass in each galaxy , which may depend on the strength of starburst in the central region , probably dominantly makes the variety of the kinetic energy of the galactic wind , although the combination of the differences of the mass , the velocity , and the dynamical time scale will determine the exact value .",
    "we have observed the central region of ngc 253 with the fabry - perot mode of the kyoto3dii mounted on the subaru telescope . we have presented the continuum and the h@xmath0 images , and the [ ] @xmath16583/h@xmath0 , [ ] @xmath26716,6731/h@xmath0 , and [ ] @xmath16583/[]@xmath26716,6731 ratio maps .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0 of filament b is larger than 1.0 , which indicates that this region is ionized / excited by shock .",
    "non - axisymmetry in the galactic wind , which is also seen in m82 , is found .",
    "the shapes of the galactic wind and the line ratio maps are non - axisymmetric about the galactic minor axis : e.g. , the [ ] /h@xmath0 of filament a is smaller than that of filament b. the [ ] /h@xmath0 map enables us to isolate filament c from the galactic wind . using the [ ] /h@xmath0 map , we extract the galactic wind region , and estimate the mass and the kinetic energy of the galactic wind : 8.6@xmath49 and 1.3@xmath44 erg , respectively",
    ". the mass and the kinetic energy of the galactic wind in ngc 253 are smaller than those in m82 and ngc 1482 .",
    "the filling factor of the galactic wind is much smaller than unity , which is consistent with that the galactic wind has a hollow structure .",
    "the energy input from supernovae in the bright blob can sufficiently supply the energy of the galactic wind .",
    "from the [ ] / [ ] ratio map , the interstellar gas in the central region and in the galactic wind is found to have a high nitrogen enrichment . the bright blob and spot i , which are stellar clusters found in _ hst _ observations , have especially high [ ] / [ ] ratios due to heavy nitrogen enrichment .",
    "we thank the staff at the subaru telescope for their help during the test observing run .",
    "we also thank t. ohtani , t. hayashi , m. ishii , y. okita , a. akita , j. sudo , m. sasaki , n. takeyama , m. a. malkan , and a. r. jenner for discussions .",
