    "it is widely accepted that the vast majority of the solar flare radiative energy originates in the photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "the chromospheric radiation is dominated by hydrogen , calcium and magnesium lines , plus hydrogen continua , providing vital diagnostics on energy deposition rates in the lower atmosphere .",
    "one of the main characteristics of the flaring chromosphere is the centrally reversed h@xmath0 emission line profile with asymmetric red and blue wings ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "earlier observations have shown that the red asymmetry in the h@xmath0 line profile is more typical and is observed frequently during the impulsive phase of the flare @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy indicates that the red asymmetry dominates over the ribbons during the flare @xcite .",
    "however , blue asymmetries have also been reported and these occur mainly in the early stages of the flare @xcite .",
    "furthermore , blue and red asymmetries at different positions in the same flare ribbon , and the reversal of asymmetry at a same position in the ribbon have also been reported @xcite .",
    "the ca 8542  line profile , which goes into full emission during the flare , is also asymmetric @xcite , but its asymmetric properties do not necessary coincide with those detected simultaneously in h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "despite a number of attempts to explain the observed asymmetries , their exact nature remains unclear .",
    "theoretical line profiles based on static models of flare chromospheres do not show asymmetric signatures @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the asymmetries are related to the velocity field in the flaring atmosphere .",
    "the red asymmetries observed in chromospheric lines during flares are usually attributed to the downflow of cool plasmas in the flaring atmosphere , a process also known as chromospheric condensation @xcite . as the flare energy is deposited in the chromosphere , a strong evaporation of the heated plasma occurs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "conservation of momentum requires the formation of a downflow in the form of chromospheric condensation @xcite .",
    "if the downflow occurs in the upper chromosphere , its effect would be a red - wing absorption which can lead to a blue asymmetry in the line profile @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that both red and blue asymmetries in the h@xmath0 line can be caused by downward moving plasma at different heights in the solar chromosphere .",
    "this blue asymmetry has also been interpreted in terms of chromospheric evaporation and filament activation @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed time - dependent h@xmath0 and ca k line profiles with the radiative - hydrodynamic code ( radyn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for weak ( f10 ) and strong ( f11 ) flare runs , and showed that asymmetries could be produced by the strong velocity gradients generated during the flare .",
    "the velocity gradients create differences in the opacity between the red and blue wings of h@xmath0 , and the sign of the gradient determines whether the asymmetric emission appears to the blue or red side of the line profile .",
    "this process was first reported in the pioneering work of @xcite , who studied the effects of acoustic shocks on the formation of the ca h line in a non - flaring atmosphere .",
    "more recently , @xcite made a direct comparison between observations and radyn simulations of an m3.0 flare .",
    "their observed and synthesised h@xmath0 and ca 8542 @xmath1 line profiles are asymmetric , especially during the early stages of the flare .    in this paper",
    "we present high temporal , spatial and spectral resolution imaging spectroscopy of an m1.1 solar flare .",
    "we study the evolution of the h@xmath0 and ca 8542  line profiles of the flare kernel , and compare these with synthesised line profiles obtained with a radiative hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the line contribution functions and the velocity field in the simulated atmosphere allow us to disentangle the nature of the observed line asymmetries .",

    "* ) instrument , mounted on the swedish 1 m solar telescope ( sst ; * ? ? ?",

    "adaptive optics were used throughout the observations , consisting of a tip - tilt mirror and a 85-electrode deformable mirror setup that is an upgrade of the system described in @xcite .",
    "the observations comprised of spectral imaging in the h@xmath0  6563   , ca 8542 @xmath1 lines and stokes v maps in fe @xmath2 .",
    "all data were reconstructed with multi - object multi - frame blind deconvolution ( momfbd ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we applied the crisp data reduction pipeline as described in @xcite .",
    "our spatial sampling is 0@xmath3.057 pixel@xmath4 and the spatial resolution is close to the diffraction limit of the telescope for many images in the time series .",
    "the h@xmath0 line scan consists of 15 positions symmetrically sampled with 0.2 @xmath1 steps from line core , with the ca 8542 @xmath1 scan consisting of 25 line positions with 0.1 @xmath1 steps .",
    "a full spectral scan had an acquisition time of a 11.54 s , which is the temporal cadence of the time series .",
    "we made use of crispex @xcite , a versatile widget - based tool for effective viewing and exploration of multi - dimensional imaging spectroscopy data .",
    "the flare was also observed by the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; * ? ? ? * ) and fermi / gbm @xcite . in section 4",

    "lightcurves of the region show that the emission from the h@xmath0 and ca 8542 @xmath1 line wings and the photospheric fe line between 16:54 and 16:56 ut increases , peaking at 16:55:24 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we find no evidence for time delays between the different wavelengths in excess of the 11.54 s temporal resolution element .    in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the h@xmath0 and ca 8542 @xmath1 line profiles averaged over the @xmath122@xmath3@xmath132@xmath3 area marked with the red boxes in figure  [ fig1 ] . shortly after the flare onset the flaring chromosphere produces a wide h@xmath0 emission profile with a central reversal .",
    "the temporal evolution of the centrally reversed h@xmath0 profiles shows excess emission in the red wing ( red asymmetry ) with nearly unshifted line center before the flare maximum ( top left panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "however , after the flare maximum the blue peak becomes higher than the red peak and hence a blue asymmetry is formed ( top right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the line centers of these blue asymmetric h@xmath0 profiles are shifted to longer wavelengths ( top right panel of figure  [ fig3 ] and figure  [ fig4 ] ) .    to quantify the asymmetry of the h@xmath0 line profiles we use a technique similar to that described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we identify the central wavelength of the red and blue peaks and compute the intensities in these positions integrated over a @xmath14  interval ( left panel of figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "these intensities are given as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the centroids of the blue and red peaks , respectively , and @xmath18 the wavelength range over which the intensities are integrated .",
    "the ratio @xmath6 allows us to study the evolution of the asymmetries as a function of time ( right panel of figure  [ fig4 ] ) , and is normalised to the mean intensity ratios of the non - flaring atmospheric profile computed over the same wavelength range , such that @xmath8 correspond to no asymmetries in the h@xmath0 line profile .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] ( right panel ) shows that at around @xmath1216:50 ut a strong red asymmetry begins to appear , increasing to the flare maximum ( @xmath1216:55 ut ) .",
    "the red asymmetry then decreases very quickly ( within about 2 minutes ) with the blue asymmetry appearing and maintained until the end of the observations .",
    "the ca 8542  line has a slightly redshifted emission profile of about 0.1   ( corresponding to a velocity @xmath19 ) , and in contrast to h@xmath0 does not reveal the asymmetry reversal during the flare ( bottom panels of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "hard x - ray emission is a typical signature for the presence of accelerated electrons in flares . assuming that the electron distribution @xmath20 has a power - law form @xmath21 ( electrons s@xmath4 kev@xmath4 ) , where @xmath22 is the normalisation factor ( proportional to the total electron rate )",
    ", @xmath23 is the low energy cutoff , and @xmath24 is the spectral index , a lower limit for the total power contained in the distribution can be estimated from : @xmath25    we fitted the hxr spectrum obtained by rhessi with a isothermal plus thick - target model ( as described above , using the ospex function ` thick2_vnorm ` ) , and calculated @xmath5 throughout the impulsive phase , integrating the counts in bins of 12 seconds .",
    "rhessi front detectors 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 and 9 were employed , and the fitting results for @xmath22 , @xmath24 , @xmath23 and @xmath5 are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "we found @xmath26 erg s@xmath4 at the time of maximum of hxr emission , between 16:55:18 and 16:55:30  ut . to obtain the energy flux ( erg s@xmath4 @xmath27 ) deposited into the chromospheric source ,",
    "one divides the power of the non - thermal electrons @xmath5 by the footpoint area .",
    "the reconstructed images for the hxr emission ( using clean , @xcite , detectors 38 , beam width factor of 1.5 ) show three main hxr sources in good association with the main locations of the optical and uv emission , as can be seen in figure  [ fig6 ]",
    ". however , the hxr sources are unresolved and the area obtained from the rhessi images would be an overestimate of the actual sizes of those regions .",
    "the area of the ribbons was hence determined by contouring a region with intensity above 30% of the maximum of the h@xmath0 - 1.4    image near the hxr peak ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we obtained an area of @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "thus , at the time of the maximum hxr emission , which also coincides with the maximum of the emission in h@xmath0 , ca ii , fe i ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) , the average energy flux delivered by the electrons into the chromosphere is around @xmath30 erg s@xmath4 @xmath27 .    , spectral index @xmath24 , low energy cutoff @xmath23 and the total power contained in the electron distribution @xmath5 , given by eq .

    "the short duration of photospheric enhancements ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) and the stationary nature of the flare ribbon makes this event a good candidate for a comparison with a dynamic model .",
    "we use the radiative - hydrodynamic code radyn to compute h@xmath0 and ca 8542   line profiles @xcite .",
    "the simulation was performed for a strong beam with @xmath31 ( also known as f11 flare ) and an isotropic pitch angle distribution in the forward hemisphere with the fokker - planck solution to the nonthermal electron distribution @xcite .",
    "a constant heating flux was applied for 20 sec , and the atmosphere was allowed to relax for 40 additional seconds .",
    "we used a power - law index and a low energy cut - off of @xmath24=4.2 and @xmath32 = 25 kev , respectively .",
    "the beam parameters used in the model are very close to the ones estimated from the hxr data ( section  [ hxr ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] shows the temporal evolution of the synthesised h@xmath0 profiles from the f11 flare model , which indicates a behaviour similar to that in the observations . increased emission in the red side of the profile ( i.e. red asymmetry )",
    "occurs when the h@xmath0 line centre is shifted to the blue , whereas during the blue asymmetry the line centre is shifted to the red .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig7 ] shows the evolution of the line profile asymmetry , @xmath6 , calculated using the method described in section  3 .",
    "simulated ca 8542  line profiles are in emission during the flare with an extended blue wing and a slightly blueshifted center ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) .    to understand the formation of the asymmetric line profiles , we need to examine the line contribution functions @xcite .",
    "these are the intensities emitted in specific wavelengths as a function of height .",
    "@xcite introduced a formal solution of the radiative transfer equation for the emergent intensity in terms of the contribution function , @xmath33 , as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the atmospheric height , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the source function , optical depth and opacity ( linear extinction coefficient ) , respectively .",
    "traditionally , this function is attuned to the three frequency ( @xmath39 ) dependent physically meaningful terms : @xmath36 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath36 is defined as the ratio of the emissivity over the opacity of the atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath40 term expresses an attenuation caused by optical depth and peaks near @xmath42 , while the ratio @xmath41 is large where there are many emitting particles at low optical depths .                in figures",
    "[ fig8 ] ,  [ fig9 ] ,  and  [ fig10 ] we present line contribution functions for h@xmath0 and ca 8542  using the classic diagrams introduced by @xcite .",
    "the diagrams are plotted in inverse gray scale with darker shades showing higher intensities .",
    "line profiles are shown as dark lines in the bottom right panels .",
    "red lines in the diagrams show the height at @xmath42 while the vertical velocity structure of the plasma is plotted as a blue dashed line .",
    "we note that positive values for velocities correspond to plasma upflows .",
    "the source functions ( green lines ) and planck functions ( brown lines ) at line center are overplotted in the bottom left panels to show the height of non - lte decoupling in the atmosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] contains a snapshot of the parameters that contribute to the h@xmath0 line profile and the formation of the red asymmetry 3 s into the f11 flare run .",
    "it shows that the line wings and line core are formed at @xmath43 and @xmath44 mm , respectively .",
    "the line source function has a local maximum near the wing formation height , and decreases towards the upper layers where the line core is formed .",
    "this leads to increased emission in the line wings , relative to the line core , hence the centrally reversed line profiles .",
    "the velocity structure of the flaring atmosphere shows that the region of h@xmath0 wing formation has a weak downflow velocity of around @xmath45 .",
    "however , the region of core formation has a moderately strong upflow with a peak value of @xmath46 at 1.17  mm ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this upflow shifts the line core of the centrally reversed h@xmath0 profile to the blue ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "therefore , the central wavelength of maximum opacity is also shifted to the blue . consequently , the @xmath42 layer is formed higher and the @xmath41 is smaller in the blue wing , and hence blue wing photons are absorbed more easily compared to their red wing counterparts . figure  [ fig9 ] shows similar diagrams 14 s into the f11 flare run . now the h@xmath0 line core is formed deeper into the atmosphere , indicating that the chromosphere is compressed by the transition region which moves downward from 1.18 mm to 1.08 mm over about 10 s ( see figures  [ fig8 ] ,  [ fig9 ] ) . at the core formation height ( at around 1.08 mm )",
    "the atmosphere has developed a moderately strong downflow ( condensation ) of about @xmath47 ( downward velocities are negative ) with a negative velocity gradient .",
    "this shifts the central reversal ( maximum opacity ) to the red side ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) . the higher lying plasma of the line core absorbs red photons , increasing the opacity in the red wing .",
    "therefore , the red wing photons produced between 0.9 - 1.05 mm can no longer escape as readily as at t=3  s because the @xmath42 curve has shifted to the red due to the downflowing material above .",
    "as a result , the @xmath42 curve is formed higher in the atmosphere at the red wing and @xmath41 is larger at the blue side of the core .",
    "this makes the contribution function , and hence the emission , larger in the blue wing and the blue asymmetry is established ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    ".,width=328 ]    figure  [ fig10 ] shows a similar diagram for the ca 8542  line 14 s into the f11 flare .",
    "this line is much narrower and formed deeper into the atmosphere ( below 1  mm ) than h@xmath0 .",
    "the velocity field along this height is very weak ( @xmath48 ) during the flare , and the line source function has a maximum at the height of core formation ( @xmath49 ) ( bottom left panel ) , so the higher emission originates from the line core .",
    "an upflow velocity field below @xmath50 produces a slightly extended blue wing and creates a blue asymmetry .",
    "however , a weak downflow at the height of core formation ( @xmath49 ) shifts the line center to the red .",
    "the temporal evolution of the h@xmath0 line profile of the flare kernel revealed excess emission in the red wing with unshifted line core before flare maximum , and excess emission in the blue wing with a red shifted line core after flare maximum .",
    "numerical simulations show that in an atmosphere without velocity fields , the centrally reversed h@xmath0 profile is symmetric with respect to the line core @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamic models take into account the mass motions associated with the processes of evaporation and condensation of the flaring material , which generate strong asymmetric signatures .",
    "we emphasize that the analysis presented here has shown that the red asymmetry observed in the h@xmath0 line profile is not necessarily associated with plasma downflows , and the blue asymmetry may not be related to plasma upflows .",
    "thus , using these line asymmetries as a direct measure of doppler velocities can lead to inaccurate results .",
    "motivated by the close match between simulations and observations , we analysed components of intensity contribution functions for the h@xmath0 and ca 8542 @xmath1 lines ( based on the approach presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we find that in the early stages of the flare the line core of the centrally reversed h@xmath0 profile is blueshifted due to the strong upflows at the height of core formation ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "the velocity decreases downward toward the wing formation regions , producing a steep positive velocity gradient .",
    "this gradient modifies the optical depth of the atmosphere in a way that higher lying ( core ) atoms absorb photons with shorter wavelengths ( blue wing photons ) and the red asymmetry is formed ( figure  [ fig8 ] ) . in the later stages the velocity field becomes dominated by the downflows due to the plasma condensation with strong negative velocity gradients ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this shifts the absorption peak ( wavelength of maximum opacity ) to the red ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig9 ] ) , so the higher lying core plasma now absorbs red photons and produces a blue asymmetry .",
    "the ca 8542  line in the f11 model is in emission and formed deeper into the atmosphere than h@xmath0 .",
    "the weak velocity field along its formation height produces an extended blue wing in the line profile ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig10 ] ) , in agreement with the observations .",
    "the simulated profile shows a weak downflow at the height of core formation which shifts the line center to the red ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "this is not detected in the observed spectra .",
    "the main difference between the simulations and the observations presented in this work is that the core of the observed h@xmath0 profiles remains unshifted when the red asymmetry is detected ( top left panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this may be due to the presence of a much more complex velocity field with several unresolved condensation / evaporation patterns , which can produce an effectively unshifted or unresolved line core .",
    "the simulations show that when the red asymmetry is formed , there are weak downflows in the region between the core and wing formation heights ( see velocity field in figure  [ fig8 ] )",
    ". however , these downflows are not strong enough to have a significant effect on the line profiles .",
    "it should be noted that the red asymmetry in h@xmath0 begins at 16:50 ( right panel of figure  [ fig4 ] ) , whereas rhessi hard x - ray emission starts to increase after 16:54 ut ( top panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this suggest that the h@xmath0 is responding to pre - impulsive phase heating . in the pre - impulsive phase flare reconnection",
    "can produce direct heating instead of non - thermal particle heating . that could drive gentle , rather then explosive , chromospheric evaporation which can produce an enhanced red - wing emission in a manner similar to the one presented in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "however , the difference between simulations and observations could be related to that the red asymmetry in simulations is a result of explosive evaporation produced by non - thermal particle heating , whereas in the observations the red asymmetry is suggested to be produced with a more gentle evaporation at the pre - impulsive phase heating .    furthermore , the evolution timescale of the observed h@xmath0 line profile is longer ( @xmath51 ) than that of the simulated line profile ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "additional direct comparisons of the improved spectral resolution observations and more realistic simulations are necessary to understand the formation of spectral line asymmetries in the flaring solar chromosphere .    the research leading to these results has received funding from the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement no . 606862 ( f - chroma ) .",

    "<S> the asymmetries observed in the line profiles of solar flares can provide important diagnostics of the properties and dynamics of the flaring atmosphere . in this paper the evolution of the h@xmath0 and ca </S>",
    "<S> 8542  lines are studied using high spatial , temporal and spectral resolution ground - based observations of an m1.1 flare obtained with the swedish 1-m solar telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal evolution of the h@xmath0 line profiles from the flare kernel shows excess emission in the red wing ( red asymmetry ) before flare maximum , and excess in the blue wing ( blue asymmetry ) after maximum . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ca 8542  line does not follow the same pattern , showing only a weak red asymmetry during the flare . </S>",
    "<S> radyn simulations are used to synthesise spectral line profiles for the flaring atmosphere , and good agreement is found with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the red asymmetry observed in h@xmath0 is not necessarily associated with plasma downflows , and the blue asymmetry may not be related to plasma upflows . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the steep velocity gradients in the flaring chromosphere modifies the wavelength of the central reversal in the h@xmath0 line profile . </S>",
    "<S> the shift in the wavelength of maximum opacity to shorter and longer wavelengths generates the red and blue asymmetries , respectively .    </S>"
