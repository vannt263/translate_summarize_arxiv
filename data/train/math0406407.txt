    "we investigate in this note the algebraic properties of kleinian groups , that is finitely generated , discrete subgroups of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the algebraic numbers .",
    "a subgroup @xmath5 is _ algebraic _ if it can be conjugated into @xmath6 .",
    "otherwise , it is _",
    "transcendental_. by mostow rigidity , all finite covolume kleinian groups are algebraic .",
    "in fact , it follows from the proof of thurston s hyperbolization theorem for haken manifolds that any kleinian group has _ some _ faithful representation into @xmath3 whose image is algebraic .",
    "this is proven by embedding the abstract kleinian group into the fundamental group of a finite volume hyperbolic 3-orbifold . the induced hyperbolic structure on the subgroup from thurston s construction is geometrically finite @xcite .",
    "it seems possible that there are algebraic kleinian groups which are geometrically finite , but which are not the subgroup of any finite volume kleinian group .",
    "however , it follows from the geometric tameness theorem @xcite and the covering theorem @xcite that if a non - geometrically finite kleinian group @xmath7 is a subgroup of a finite volume kleinian group @xmath8 , then @xmath7 is a surface group containing a fiber subgroup @xmath9 of a virtual fibration of @xmath10 of index at most 2 in @xmath7 .",
    "each end of a kleinian group is either geometrically finite , or simply degenerate @xcite .",
    "thus , in this case @xmath9 has two simply degenerate ends , and there is an infinite order isometry @xmath11 which normalizes @xmath9 , and acts by a translation on @xmath12 . it does not appear to be known whether there are degenerate algebraic kleinian groups which are not of this type . a similar argument to the covering theorem shows that a singly degenerate hyperbolic 3-manifold can not immerse totally geodesically in a higher dimensional geometrically finite hyperbolic manifold .",
    "any algebraic kleinian group @xmath7 embeds in a natural way into a higher rank s - arithmetic lattice .",
    "but the embedding does not induce a quasi - isometric embedding on the convex core of @xmath13 into the corresponding cover of the symmetric space , otherwise the techniques of the covering theorem would carry over .",
    "one may construct simplicial ruled surfaces in higher rank symmetric spaces , but the bounded diameter lemma and local finiteness fail .",
    "it would be interesting to know if there can be singly degenerate algebraic surface kleinian groups .",
    "we demonstrate in this note that there are families of degenerate punctured torus kleinian groups satisfying certain geometric restrictions which must be transcendental .",
    "the families of groups we consider are uncountable , and therefore all but countably many groups in a family will be transcendental ; the point of the result is that _ all _ of the groups in the family are transcendental .",
    "one motivation for studying this question is to understand whether there is an algorithm to tell that a collection of matrices in @xmath14 generates a discrete subgroup of @xmath15 .",
    "if every non - geometrically finite kleinian group were the subgroup of a finite volume kleinian group , then an algorithm would exist .",
    "so the discovery of a singly degenerate algebraic kleinian group would demonstrate the difficulty of this question .",
    "* acknowledgment * we thank caltech and nathan dunfield for their hospitality during a visit in which this work was carried out .",
    "in this section , we review the classification of punctured torus kleinian groups from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be a punctured torus .",
    "a punctured torus group @xmath17 is a 2 generator free discrete subgroup of @xmath3 , such that there exist two generators of @xmath17 whose commutator is parabolic .",
    "@xmath17 is naturally identified as the image of a discrete faithful representation @xmath18 such that the monodromy of the puncture is parabolic .",

    "let @xmath21 denote the upper half plane model for hyperbolic space , with boundary @xmath22 .",
    "the farey triangulation is a graph in @xmath23 with vertices at @xmath24 , and two rational numbers @xmath25 are connected by a hyperbolic geodesic if @xmath26 ( where we let @xmath27 ) .",

    "the curve complex @xmath28 of the punctured torus has vertices consisting of isotopy classes of simple closed curves .",
    "the edges of @xmath28 join pairs of curves which intersect exactly once .",
    "there is a natural bijection of @xmath29 with the farey triangulation , for example by considering projective homology classes in @xmath30 .",
    "given a basis @xmath31 for @xmath32 , any oriented simple closed curve represents a homology class @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "then we get an element @xmath35 , which gives a bijection with unoriented simple closed curves .",
    "the number @xmath36 represents the geometric intersection number between two simple closed curves @xmath37 .",
    "if we lift a punctured torus group representation @xmath38 to @xmath39 , then the function @xmath40 is well - defined on conjugacy classes of elements in @xmath41 .",
    "this function takes values in @xmath42 if @xmath43 is algebraic .",
    "the lift @xmath44 is well - defined up to multiplying generators by @xmath45 . given three adjacent curves @xmath46 , with traces @xmath47 , they satisfy the markoff equation @xmath48 moreover , if @xmath49 is adjacent to @xmath50 with trace @xmath51 , then these satisfy the equation @xmath52 these formulae follow from trace identities in @xmath15 , see @xcite for details .",

    "the ends are either geometrically finite , or simply degenerate .",
    "to each end , associate an end invariant @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is geometrically finite , then @xmath65 is the point in teichmller space of the conformal structure of the domain of discontinuity corresponding to @xmath63 , or if there is an accidental parabolic , it is the curve @xmath66 represented by the accidental parabolic in @xmath63 . if @xmath63 is simply degenerate , then there is a unique ending lamination @xmath67 which is a limit point of simple curves in @xmath28 whose geodesic representatives in @xmath59 have bounded length and exit the end @xmath63 .    to each end invariant @xmath68 , we associate an element @xmath69 of @xmath70 , @xmath71 . if the end @xmath63 is simply degenerate or has an accidental parabolic , then @xmath72 . if @xmath63 is geometrically finite , then @xmath69 is a systole in the hyperbolic structure on @xmath16 corresponding to the teichmller point @xmath68 , which is defined up to finite ambiguity .",
    "we will assume from now on that @xmath73 is simply degenerate , so that @xmath74 .",

    "the edges of @xmath80 admit a natural order where @xmath81 if @xmath82 separates the interior of @xmath83 from @xmath76 , and this induces an order on @xmath84 ( see figure [ pivot ] ) .",
    "so we can arrange @xmath84 as a sequence @xmath85 , where @xmath86 if @xmath87 , and @xmath88 otherwise .",
    "we note that the vertices of @xmath80 which are not elements of @xmath84 also are ordered , and we will denote these by @xmath89 , with the convention that @xmath90 is adjacent to @xmath91 in @xmath28 and @xmath92 ( meaning that any edge of @xmath80 incident with @xmath91 is @xmath93 the unique edge of @xmath80 incident with @xmath90 ) .",
    "the _ width _ of @xmath94 is @xmath95 the number of vertices in @xmath96 which are adjacent to @xmath94 in @xmath28 and which are @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( in the example in figure [ pivot ] , @xmath99 ) .",

    "let @xmath133 choose @xmath134 large enough that @xmath135 for any pivot @xmath136 with width @xmath134 , which we may choose by equation [ bound ] .",
    "we may choose the widths @xmath137 arbitrarily .",
    "this describes the recursive construction of the sequence @xmath116 .",
    "if @xmath1 is associated to the width sequence @xmath138 coming from the construction , then for any ending lamination @xmath2 , the punctured torus group @xmath17 associated to @xmath0 is transcendental .",
    "suppose we had a punctured torus group @xmath139 , with associated ending pair @xmath0 , where @xmath1 has the width sequence @xmath140 given in the construction above .",
    "then @xmath141 , for some @xmath142 .",
    "thus , we have for the pivot @xmath136 , @xmath143 conclusion ----------    most likely , the numbers @xmath144 coming from the construction are transcendental , since the continued fraction coefficients of @xmath1 are given by @xmath145 ( up to ambiguity of a finite initial sequence ) , and the numbers @xmath145 should grow fast enough to satisfy liouville s criterion for being transcendental .",
    "one could get explicit sequences @xmath140 which are defined recursively and satisfy the requirements of the construction by using the generalized liouville theorem , which bounds the length of @xmath146 in terms of the length of @xmath147 and the lengths of @xmath128 .",
    "the length of a polynomial is the sum of the absolute values of its coefficients , and the length of an algebraic number is the length of its minimal polynomial .",
    "then the set @xmath148 would be all algebraic numbers with length and degree @xmath149 , which is a finite set , and one could estimate the growth of the bound on @xmath146 using equation [ recursion ] recursively",

    "the same technique produces transcendental ending laminations for 4 punctured sphere groups and 2 parabolic generator groups .",
