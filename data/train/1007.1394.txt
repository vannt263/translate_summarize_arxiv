    "motion along curved trajectories is always associated with a normal force which according to kinematics is given by , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the speed and @xmath2 the radius of curvature of the track .",

    "the problem is conservative since the normal force does not do work , by definition .",

    "students that wish to understand the physics behind amusement park experiences in greater detail must therefore be prepared to study curves more advanced than the circle .    here",
    "we will derive the shape of the tracks that produce a constant normal force .",

    "he showed that this problem is integrable and derived some general results . adding a normal force in space",
    "requires the firing of rockets perpendicular to the velocity . the much more natural problem of a constant gravitational force , a good approximation in amusement parks , with the normal force coming from a smooth track , also turns out to be integrable , as we will show in this article .",

    "@xcite found that the trajectories of the kepler problem are arcs of circles in velocity space .",
    "as it turns out the trajectories of our problem are circles in acceleration space .",
    "integrating once we thus find that the trajectories in velocity space correspond to the conic section solutions of the kepler problem .",
    "the shape of the tracks that lead to a normal force of constant magnitude @xmath5 are then obtained by one further integration .",

    "obviously there is another conserved quantity for this problem : the energy @xmath29 without loss of generality we can assume initial conditions such that @xmath30 .",
    "we then have , @xmath31 we thus have a two dimensional problem with two conserved quantities and this means that we have an integrable problem .",

    "this is easily recognized as the expression for a conic section ( see _ e.g. _  goldstein @xcite ) where @xmath33 corresponds to the eccentricity , and where the origin corresponds to one of the foci .",
    "we have arrived at the conclusion that the velocity space trajectory , the hodograph , of a constant normal force trajectory is a conic section , _",
    "i.e. _  an ellipse , a parabola , or a hyperbola .",
    "we note that , only in the elliptic case , when the eccentricity @xmath34 will the speed , @xmath35 , be finite for all angles . for @xmath36 , the parabolic case",
    ", the speed goes to infinity for @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 the speed goes to infinity along the asymptotes @xmath39 .",
