    "one can distinguish in the leading order qcd approach the direct and the resolved processes . in the first case the photon participates directly in the hard scattering subprocess by photon - gluon - fusion or qcd - compton scattering and transfers a large fraction ( @xmath8 ) of its primary energy to the secondary jets .",
    "in the second case , the hard scattering subprocess involves the partons ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) in the photon and in the proton and the energy fraction @xmath11 . at hera",
    "the dominant direct and resolved processes correspond to quark and gluon exchange respectively and the expected distributions in the dijet @xmath12 scattering angle @xmath13 have been clearly observed at hera @xcite .",
    "particularly simple results arise for the soft radiation perpendicular to the scattering plane @xcite . in this case",
    "complications with the cut - off in the transverse momentum @xmath14 disappear and all formulae depend only on the angles between the hard partons . in the simplest case of a @xmath5 dipole",
    "the density of gluons with momentum @xmath15 perpendicular to @xmath5 is @xmath16 the soft radiation in more complicated hard processes involving gluons , relevant in the present discussion , can be obtained from appropriate superpositions of elementary dipoles .",
    "we consider the ratio @xmath17 of the perpendicular radiation in the process @xmath18 and in a standard @xmath5 process with @xmath19",

    "( 58 - 61 ) were derived @xcite for small scattering angles .",
    "there is only a weak dependence on this angle and for @xmath24 , where the gluon exchange dominates , they approach @xmath26 using the known full expressions for the soft gluon radiation patterns @xcite we found the approximate results for the leading processes @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be correct within @xmath29 for @xmath30 ; within this accuracy one can safely neglect the contribution from the process @xmath31 ( see eqs .",

    ".angular dependence of symmetrized cross section ratios @xmath32 for quark and leading gluon exchange processes [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have made a ` monte carlo measurement ' of this ratio using the herwig  @xcite program .",
    "herwig contains coherent qcd radiation effects and a cluster hadronization model .",
    "however , since herwig produces a complete simulation of events , realistic jet algorithms and detector acceptance cuts can be applied .",
    "thus , if herwig is consistent with the analytical results , this is an indication that the perturbative calculations are relevant for soft particles as well , that the results are insensitive to detector acceptance effects , and that the measurement is likely to be feasible .",
    "herwig events with a hard scatter of @xmath34  gev were generated for hera beam conditions in the region @xmath35",
    "gev@xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the usual inelasticity variable and @xmath38 is the virtuality of the photon exchanged between the proton and the positron .",
    "the @xmath39 jet finder was run in inclusive mode  @xcite on the hadronic final state , and two jets with @xmath40 , at least one of which must have @xmath41  gev , were demanded , in the pseudorapidity region @xmath42 .",
    "we have also imposed the cut @xmath43 , constraining the boost of the dijet system so to achieve a more uniform acceptance in jet scattering angle , as described in  @xcite .",
    "together , these cuts correspond to a region in which measurements have previously be made at hera .",
    "only @xmath44  pb@xmath45 of simulated data was used .",
    "based upon the variable @xmath48  @xcite , the fraction of the photon s momentum which enters into the dijet system , we then divide the events into two samples - @xmath49 ( ` resolved ' ) and @xmath50 ( ` direct ' ) .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath46 spectra for resolved / direct events is calculated , and is shown in the upper two figures for two regions of scattering angle , large ( left ) and small ( right ) - solid points .",
    "the small scattering angle region is defined by @xmath51 and the large by @xmath52 . in terms of @xmath53",
    ", these ranges correspond approximately to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the plots also show the predictions above for these kinematic ranges .",
    "the line shows the prediction taking the subprocess mixture as given by herwig .",
    "the band shows the uncertainty in the prediction if absolutely no knowledge of the partonic subprocess type , but a perfect separation of resolved and direct type diagrams is assumed . in all cases , processes not included in the table are neglected .",
    "the herwig results approach the analytic predictions at low @xmath46 . also shown ( clear circles ) is the result from herwig when multiparton interactions are allowed  @xcite with a @xmath56 for the hard scatter of 2.5  gev .",
    "multiparton interactions are often appealed to as a means of improving agreement between data and mc in the hera region .",
    "they raise the ratio slightly , moving it closer to the prediction for high angle scattering , and further away for small angle scattering .    because the resolved cross section peaks strongly at low scattering angles while the direct matrix element does",
    "not , the high @xmath48 sample for small scattering angles in fact consists of 30% resolved - type diagrams .",
    "this is why the ` prediction ' lies outside the band , since in constructing the band it was assumed that the separation between resolved and direct lo diagrams was perfect .",
    "the extra contamination from resolved acts against the enhancement in the ratio coming from the angular dependence of the radiation .",
    "clearly a better way of distinguishing resolved and direct type diagrams is required - either a new variable , or a harder cut on @xmath48 . we have tried cutting at @xmath57 , at the same moving the separation between low and high angular regions to @xmath58 .",
    "the results are shown in the lower plots .",
    "the prediction for low angle scattering is raised slightly and the agreement with herwig is rather good .",
    "so it looks like for these distributions the herwig results reproduce duality picture quite closely .",
    "further improvements in these tests are undoubtedly possible .",
    "the results presented reiterate that it is of great interest to measure these distributions in hera data .",
    "the direct comparison of the low momentum particle production in direct and resolved processes should yield the ratio of colour factors @xmath59 .",
    "its observation is a crucial test of the significance ( or otherwise ) of multiparton interaction models and , more fundamentally , of the perturbative picture for soft particle production .",
