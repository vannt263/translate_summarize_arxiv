    "the numerical part of the work has been devoted to verify these theoretical expectations :    * we have determined numerically the two critical couplings of the @xmath0 @xmath59 vector models and given estimates of the critical indices @xmath24 at both transitions .",
    "our findings support for all @xmath25 the standard scenario of three phases : a disordered phase at high temperatures , a massless or bkt one at intermediate temperatures and an ordered phase , occurring at lower and lower temperatures as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this matches perfectly with the @xmath49 limit , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath0 @xmath18 model , where the ordered phase is absent or , equivalently , appears at @xmath60 .",
    "* we have found that the values of the critical index @xmath24 at the two transitions are compatible with the theoretical expectations . *",
    "the index @xmath3 also appears to be compatible with the value @xmath61 , in agreement with rg predictions .    on the basis of this study and taking into account previous works  @xcite ,",
    "we are prompted to conclude that @xmath0 @xmath1 vector models in the standard formulation undergo two phase transitions of the bkt type .",
    "furthermore , the standard and the villain formulations belong to the same universality class with @xmath32 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    considering the determinations of the critical couplings as a function of @xmath4 , we have calculated the leading dependences using rg equations and conjectured the approximate scaling for @xmath64 in the standard version .",
