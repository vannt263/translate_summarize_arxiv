    "for a diagram @xmath0 of an oriented link @xmath1 , mikhail khovanov @xcite constructed a collection of groups @xmath2 such that @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a version of the jones polynomial of @xmath1 .",
    "these groups are constructed as homology groups of chain complexes .",
    "the primary goal of this note is to rewrite this construction in terms more pleasant for topologists .    to some extent",
    "this has been done recently by dror bar - natan in his preprint @xcite .",
    "this came together with progress in calculation and understanding of khovanov homology , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the outbreak of activity that happened two years after the release of initial paper has proved that stripping khovanov s construction of its fancy formal decorations was useful .",
    "i hope that a further chewing of khovanov s construction that is presented below occur to be useful .",
    "i am grateful to khovanov , who made these my considerations possible by not only the very initiating of the subject , but also by keeping ( at least during the fall of 1998 ) his text secret , while giving talks about his work at various seminars .",
    "the rumors reached me , and i tried to figure out how homology with the euler characteristic equal to the kauffman bracket could be defined .",
    "when the preprint became available , i found that khovanov s construction can be reformulated in the way that i had guessed .",
    "i could upload then most of the text presented below , but hesitated , since i had no real new results based on my chewing .",
    "i still have no them , but feel that a text showing how a transition from kauffman bracket to khovanov homology could be motivated for a topologist may be appreciated . some irresponsible speculations about possible generalizations",
    "are included at the end of section [ s1 ] .",
    "the khovanov homology is closer to kauffman bracket , which is an invariant of non - oriented , but framed links , rather than to the jones polynomial , which is an invariant of oriented , but non - framed links .",
    "the corresponding modification of khovanov homology is presented in section [ s2 ] .",
    "this allows us to write down a categorification of the kauffman skein relation for kauffman bracket .",
    "the skein relation gives rise to a homology sequence .",
    "since the euler characteristic does not change under passing from a chain complex to its homology , it is natural to expect that @xmath5 appear as the homology groups of a chain complex @xmath6 such that its polynomial euler characteristic @xmath7 is the jones polynomial @xmath8 .",
    "khovanov constructs such a complex starting with the kauffman state sum presentation of the jones polynomial",
    ". however , the construction proceeds as a chain of algebraic constructions of auxiliary objects .",
    "this hides a simple geometric meaning .",
    "a natural generators of khovanov s complex can be represented as enhancements of the states from the kauffman state sum presentation of the jones polynomial .",
    "recall that for a state sum representation of the jones polynomial , kauffman @xcite introduced the following states of a link diagram .",
    "each state is a collection of markers . at each crossing of the diagram",
    "there should be a marker specifying a pair of vertical angles .",
    "see figure [ f - markers ] .          each marker of a kauffman state has a _ sign _ , which is @xmath9 ( or , rather , @xmath10 ) if the direction of rotation of the upper string towards the lower one through the specified pair of vertical angles is counter - clock - wise , and @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) otherwise . for a state @xmath13 of a diagram @xmath0 denote by @xmath14 the difference between the numbers of positive and negative markers .",
    "a state of a diagram defines a _ smoothing _ of the diagram : at each of its double points the marked angles are united in a connected area , see figure [ f - smoothings ] .",
    "the result of the smoothing is a collection of circles embedded into the plane .",
    "denote the union of these circles by @xmath15 . the number of the circles is denoted by @xmath16 .    with a crossing point of a diagram of an oriented link we associate _ local writhe number _ equal to    * @xmath10 , if at the point the diagram looks like @xmath17 , and * @xmath12 , if it looks like @xmath18 .",
    "the sum of local writhe numbers over all crossing points of a link diagram @xmath0 is called the _ writhe number _ of @xmath0 and denoted by @xmath19 .    to a kauffman state @xmath13 of an oriented link diagram @xmath0 we assign a polynomial @xmath20 where @xmath19 is the writhe number of @xmath0 .",
    "the sum of @xmath21 over all states @xmath13 of the diagram is a version the jones polynomial of @xmath1 .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "khovanov @xcite uses another variable @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 .",
    "it is related to @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "following khovanov , we denote the corresponding version of the jones polynomial by @xmath4 .",
    "it is defined by @xmath26 .",
    "certainly , @xmath4 can be presented as the sum of the corresponding versions of @xmath21 over all kauffman states @xmath13 .",
    "the summand of @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath13 can be defined via @xmath27 or , more directly , by @xmath28      by an _",
    "enhanced kauffman state _",
    "@xmath29 of an oriented link diagram @xmath0 we shall mean a collection of markers comprising a usual kauffman state @xmath13 of @xmath0 enhanced by an assignment of a plus or minus sign to each of the circles obtained by the smoothing of @xmath0 according to the markers .    denote by @xmath30 the difference between the numbers of pluses and minuses assigned to the circles of @xmath15 .",
    "put @xmath31 observe that both @xmath14 and @xmath19 are congruent modulo 2 to the number of crossing points . therefore @xmath32 is an integer .",
    "recall that @xmath33 .",
    "we can associate to each component of @xmath15 one of @xmath16 factors @xmath34 of the right hand side of this formula .    passing to the enhanced kauffman states , we associate the summand @xmath35 of the sum @xmath36 to a component of @xmath37 equipped with @xmath9 .",
    "to the same component , but equipped with @xmath11 , we associate the summand @xmath38 .",
    "thus an enhancement of a kauffman state gives rise to a choice of a summand from each of the binomial factors in the formula defining @xmath21 .",
    "now by opening the brackets we obtain the following presentation for @xmath21 : @xmath39 denote by @xmath40 the summand @xmath41 which corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "hence @xmath42 and @xmath43      let us switch to variable @xmath23 used by khovanov .",
    "@xmath44 denote @xmath45 by @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , @xmath47      denote the free abelian group generated by enhanced kauffman states of a link diagram @xmath0 by @xmath48 .",
    "denote by @xmath49 the subgroup of @xmath48 generated by enhanced kauffman states @xmath29 of @xmath0 with @xmath50 .",
    "thus @xmath48 is a @xmath51-graded free abelian group : @xmath52    for an enhanced kauffman state @xmath29 belonging to a kauffman state @xmath13 of a link diagram @xmath0 , put @xmath53 denote by @xmath54 the subgroup of @xmath49 generated by enhanced kauffman states @xmath29 with @xmath55 .",
    "notice that as follows from , @xmath56    * _ _ * remark .",
    "the kauffman choice of variable ( @xmath24 instead of @xmath23 ) in the jones polynomial discussed above suggests another choice of the second grading of @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , the choices incorporate already two different @xmath57-grading : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "however these @xmath57-grading differ just by the reduction modulo 2 of the first one , @xmath60 one can prove that the kauffman choice of variable gives rise to the same homology groups .",
    "let @xmath0 be a diagram of an oriented link @xmath1 . in @xcite khovanov defined in @xmath54 a differential of bidegree @xmath61 and proved that its homology groups @xmath2 do not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the construction of the differential depends on ordering of crossing points of @xmath0 , although the homology groups do not .",
    "suppose that the crossing points of @xmath0 are numerated by natural numbers @xmath62 .",
    "khovanov s description of the differential is somewhat complicated by several auxiliary algebraic constructions .",
    "i give here its simplified version .",
    "i just describe the matrix elements . in the context of chain complex",
    "the matrix elements are traditionally called _",
    "incidence numbers_. for enhanced kauffman states @xmath63 and @xmath64 , denote their incidence number by @xmath65 .",
    "recall that @xmath54 is generated by enhanced kauffman states .",
    "thus an incidence number is a function of two enhanced kauffman states , say @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( which are generators of @xmath54 and @xmath66 , respectively ) .",
    "enhanced kauffman states with a nonzero incidence number are said to be _ incident _ to each other .",
    "pairs of incident states satisfy natural restrictions .",
    "surprisingly , these restrictions give exact description of the set of incident states : each pair of enhanced kauffman states which is not thrown away by the restrictions consists of incident states .",
    "the first restriction emerges from our desire to have a differential of bidegree @xmath61 . since the differential preserves @xmath67 and increases @xmath68 by one , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "recall that @xmath71 .",
    "therefore @xmath70 implies that @xmath72 , in other words the number of negative markers of @xmath64 is greater by one than the number of negative markers of @xmath63 .",
    "it is natural to enforce this numerological restriction in the following way :    _ the incidence number is zero , unless only at one crossing point of @xmath0 the markers of @xmath63 and @xmath64 differ and at this crossing the marker of @xmath63 is positive , while the marker of @xmath64 is negative .",
    "_    in our description of the incidence number of @xmath63 and @xmath64 we will assume that this is the case .",
    "the crossing point where the markers differ is called the _ difference point _ of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "let it have number @xmath73 .    since exactly at one crossing",
    "the markers differ , @xmath74 is obtained from @xmath75 by a single oriented morse modification of index 1 .",
    "hence @xmath76 .",
    "in other words either @xmath74 is obtained from @xmath75 by joining two circles or by splitting a circle of @xmath75 into two circles .",
    "here is the next natural restriction on incident states :    _ the incidence number of @xmath63 and @xmath64 vanishes , unless the common circles of @xmath75 and @xmath74 have the same signs . _    this , together with equality @xmath77 , gives a strong restriction also on the signs of the circles of @xmath78 adjacent to the @xmath73th crossing point .",
    "indeed , @xmath79 thus @xmath80 .",
    "now we can easily list all the situations which satisfy these restrictions ( see figure [ f - xinc ] ) :    1 .",
    "if @xmath81 and both joining circles of @xmath75 are negative then the resulting circle of @xmath64 should be negative .",
    "2 .   if @xmath81 and the joining circles of @xmath75 have different signs then the resulting circle of @xmath64 should be positive .",
    "3 .   if the joining circles of @xmath75 are positive , none @xmath64 can be incident .",
    "4 .   if @xmath82 and the splitting circle of @xmath75 is positive then both of the circles of @xmath74 obtained from it should be positive .",
    "5 .   if @xmath82 and the splitting circle of @xmath75 is negative then the circles of @xmath74 obtained from it should be of different signs .     at a crossing point",
    "are connected in the whole @xmath15 . ]    in each of the cases listed above the incidence number @xmath65 is @xmath83 .",
    "the sign depends on the ordering of the crossing points : it is equal to @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the number of negative markers in @xmath63 numerated with numbers greater than @xmath73 .",
    "this sign is needed to make the differential satisfying identity @xmath86 . however",
    ", the proof of this identity requires some routine check . at first glance ,",
    "khovanov @xcite escaped it .",
    "in fact , it is hidden in the checking ( which was left to the reader ) that @xmath87 is a functor , see @xcite , section 2.2 .",
    "khovanov constructed not only groups @xmath88 , but also graded modules @xmath89 over the ring @xmath90 $ ] of polynomials with integer coefficients in variable @xmath91 of degree 2 .",
    "the grading is a representation of @xmath89 as a direct sum of abelian subgroups @xmath92 such that multiplication by @xmath91 in @xmath89 gives rise to a homomorphism @xmath93 .    to construct homology groups @xmath92 , let us define the corresponding complex of graded @xmath90$]-modules @xmath94 .",
    "the module @xmath94 is the sum of its subgroups @xmath95 .",
    "the group @xmath95 is generated by formal products @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath29 is an enhanced kauffman states @xmath29 with @xmath55 and @xmath98 .    the differential is defined almost in the same way . the states which were adjacent above are adjacent here , as well as their products by the same power of @xmath91 .",
    "products of enhanced kauffman states by different powers of @xmath91 are not adjacent , besides the following situations : @xmath99 is adjacent to @xmath100 , if the markers of @xmath63 and @xmath64 differ exactly at one point , where the marker of @xmath63 is positive and the marker of @xmath64 negative , the signs of @xmath63 and @xmath64 on the common circles of @xmath75 and @xmath74 are the same , @xmath82 , the splitting circle of @xmath75 is negative , and the circles of @xmath74 obtained from it are positive , see figure [ c - inc ] , where this situation is shown symbolically in the style of figure [ f - xinc ] .",
    "each group @xmath95 is finitely generated , but there are infinitely many non - trivial groups .",
    "groups @xmath92 with fixed @xmath68 and sufficiently large @xmath67 are isomorphic to each other",
    ".      how can one understand construction of khovanov homology ?",
    "by understanding i mean a formulation which would give , true or false , indication to possible generalizations .",
    "the general program of categorification pictured by khovanov in @xcite is an attractive approach to the problem of constructing combinatorial counterparts for donaldson and seiberg - witten invariants , although it does not promise a fast and technically easy track .    in the construction above the specific of kauffman bracket",
    "is used so much that it is difficult to imagine a geralization to other polynomial link invariants .",
    "a state sum over smoothings along kauffman markers does not appear in formulas representing any other quantum invariant .",
    "of course , there are many state sum formulas .",
    "one can try to decompose any of them to a sum of monomials and consider decompositions as chains .",
    "attach to them appropriate dimensions and define differentials such that the homology groups would be invariant under reidemeister moves .",
    "success of the whole project depends on quality of several guesses .",
    "the most difficult of the guesses seems to be the choice of differentials .",
    "it may involve and rely on a delicate analysis of the effects of reidemeister moves .",
    "however a wrong choice at the previous step can make any efforts at this last step unfruitful .",
    "an additional hint comes from khovanov s mention of lusztig s canonical bases .",
    "indeed , signs which are attached to circles in a smoothened link diagram can be replaced with orientations and an orientation was interpreted by frenkel and khovanov @xcite as an element of lusztig s canonical basis .",
    "smoothings at crossing points correspond then to monomials of the entries of the @xmath101-matrix .",
    "the decomposition of the entries of @xmath101-matrix to monomials not as clear as it seams : in the only known case considered above a zero entry of @xmath101-matrix is decomposed to two non - zero monomials canceling each other .",
    "however , the main guess is still to be done after the entries of the @xmath101-matrix in crystal bases are decomposed to monomials : one should find a differential that would give homology invariant under reidemeister moves .",
    "if the guesses made above about the rles of crystal bases and monomials of @xmath101-matrices are correct , @xmath102-dimensional tqfts would not appear in the future more involved categorifications . instead of cobordisms of 1-manifolds , there appear probably cobordisms of 4-valent graphs with some additional structure .",
    "how can one estimate chances for further categorification of quantum topology ?",
    "still , they do not seem to be clear , despite of high optimism of khovanov.as for chain groups , the observations made above are encouraging .",
    "however , we are not even able to discuss the choice of differentials on a comparable level of generality .",
    "it would be very interesting , especially for prospective 4-dimensional applications , to find a categorification of face state models .",
    "involvement of an orientation of link in the definition of the jones polynomial in section [ s1.3 ] is easy to localize .",
    "it is limited to to the writhe number @xmath19 of @xmath0 .",
    "if we remove @xmath19 , we get the _ kauffman bracket _ of diagram @xmath0 . to eliminate fractional powers ,",
    "we stay with kauffman s variable @xmath24 .",
    "thus kauffman bracket of a link diagram @xmath0 is @xmath103 it is not invariant under first reidemeister moves . hence it is not an ambient isotopy invariant of link .",
    "however it is invariant with respect to second and third reidemeister moves .",
    "a link diagram defines the blackboard framing on the link .",
    "the isotopies which accompany second and third reidemeister moves can be extended to the isotopy of the corresponding framings .",
    "moreover , embedding of the diagrams to the 2-sphere makes this relation two - sided : link diagrams on @xmath104 can be converted to each other by a sequence of second and third reidemeister moves iff the corresponding links with blackboard framings are isotopic in the class of framed links .",
    "since the kauffman bracket can be defined for a link diagram on 2-sphere , this makes the kauffman bracket invariant for non - oriented framed links .        for an enhanced kauffman state of a link diagram @xmath0 ,",
    "put @xmath105 if this is an oriented link , and hence @xmath19 is defined , then @xmath106 in terms of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the kauffman bracket is expressed as follows : @xmath109    denote the free abelian group generated by enhanced kauffman states @xmath29 of @xmath0 with @xmath110 and @xmath111 by @xmath112 .",
    "if one orients the link , the khovanov chain groups @xmath54 appear , and @xmath113 under this identification , the differentials of the khovanov complex turn into differentials @xmath114 ( the construction of the differentials does not involve orientation of the link , hence it does not matter what orientation is used ) . denote the homology group of the complex obtained by @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a link diagram , @xmath91 its crossing and @xmath116 , @xmath117 be link diagrams obtained from @xmath0 by smoothing at @xmath91 along positive and negative markers , respectively . as is well - known , the kauffman brackets of @xmath0 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are related as follows @xmath118 this equality is called the",
    "_ kauffman skein relation .",
    "_ it allows one to define the kauffman bracket up to a normalization ( which can be done by fixing the kauffman bracket of the unknot ) .",
    "let us categorify this skein relation .",
    "consider map @xmath119 which sends an enhanced kauffman state @xmath29 of @xmath117 to the enhanced kauffman state of @xmath0 smoothing along which coincides with the smoothing of @xmath117 along @xmath29 and signs of the ovals are the same , too .",
    "the collection of these maps is a homomorphism of complex , that is they commute with @xmath120 , provided @xmath91 is the last crossing of @xmath0 in the ordering of crossings which is used in the construction of @xmath120 .",
    "indeed , the incidence coefficients are the same for an enhanced kauffman states of @xmath117 and its images in @xmath0 , and the latter can not contain in the boundary a state with positive marker at @xmath91 .    now consider map @xmath121 which sends each enhanced kauffman state with negative marker at @xmath91 to 0 and each enhanced kauffman state with positive marker at @xmath91 to the enhanced kauffman state of @xmath116 with the same smoothing and signs of the ovals .",
    "this is again a complex homomorphism .",
    "homomorphisms @xmath122 and @xmath123 form a short exact sequence of complexes : @xmath124 it induces collection of long homology sequences : @xmath125 a special case of this sequence , which relates the groups of connected sum and disjoint sum of knots , can be found in section 7.4 of khovanov s paper @xcite .",
    "this special case is the only one which can be formulated for the original version of homology depending on orientations of links .",
