    "however , the counter - example given there is an integrable system , cf @xcite , section 3 . in spite of",
    "this fact fokas adapted the remark and formulated the following conjecture in 1987 , @xcite .",
    "if a scalar equation possesses at least one time - independent non - lie point symmetry , then it possesses infinitely many . similarly for n - component equations one needs n symmetries .",
    "besides their mathematical interest , the observation and conjecture are of some practical importance since they are used to argue that it is enough to find only one or two symmetries of a system in order to declare it integrable , cf @xcite and the discussion in @xcite . this would be reasonable practice if it was simply not possible to prove integrability , but the methods employed in @xcite showhow one can effectively obtain integrability proofs .",
    "moreover , four years later bakirov @xcite published the first example of a non - integrable equation in the possession of a generalized symmetry .",
    "the system @xmath5 has a sixth order symmetry @xmath6 as one can easily check .",
    "it was shown ( with extensive computer algebra computations ) that there are no other symmetries up to order 53 .",
    "the authors of @xcite proved in 1998 that the system of bakirov does not possess another symmetry at any higher order , thereby proving that indeed one symmetry does not imply integrability . in @xcite",

    "how to solve the equation @xmath15=0 $ ] , given the order of @xmath9 and @xmath14 ?",
    "first of all , we see that if @xmath9 is polynomial , @xmath14 has to be polynomial too , cf .",
    "this enables us to use the symbolic calculus as developed in @xcite . with the symbolic calculus",

    "one is free to choose @xmath32 $ ] as long as the @xmath25-degree of @xmath9 remains smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "if this sounds a bit too easy , the reader should note that this determines the system and its symmetry at the same time , and does not say anything about hierarchies of symmetries .",
    "if the resultant of two polynomials vanishes , then their greatest common divisor has positive degree .",

    "this implies that to cover systems with finitely many symmetries the degree of the common factor of the @xmath22-functions should be higher than 2 .",

    "indeed @xmath97 one step further gives @xmath98 this shows that the method of hensel is constructive .",
    "skolems method allows us to conclude that there exist only a finite number of symmetries . at first sight",
    "it looks a bit technical , but it is extremely powerful in our context .",
    "the method is based on the fact that if some equation does not have a solution in some p - adic field then it can not have a solution in @xmath99 .",
    "moreover the method reduces the number of orders that need to be checked to a finite number .    if @xmath100 then by fermats little theorem there exists a @xmath101 such that @xmath102 .",
