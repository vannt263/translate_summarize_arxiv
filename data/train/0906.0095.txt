    "recent star and phenix experimental results @xcite have shown that light partons with high transverse momentum lose a significant amount of energy when traversing the dense nuclear medium created in central au+au collisions .",
    "this leads to suppression of high - p@xmath0 hadron yields and the disappearance of the away - side peak in the azimuthal hadron - hadron correlation function .",
    "the investigation of the azimuthal correlation function of high - p@xmath0 hadrons with medium- or low - p@xmath0 associated particle have shown a broad double - peak structure on the away side ( @xmath2)@xcite . there is an intensive discussion of the possible explanation of this observation including mach cone scenario @xcite , gluon cherenkov radiation @xcite , or jet deflection @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether similar effect is present in a case of heavy quarks passing the medium .",
    "heavy quarks are primarily produced during early stages of a nuclear collision , then they interact with the medium , and they can be used as a probe of the space - time evolution of the medium arising from a heavy ion collision . because of their large masses , their energy loss is expected to be influenced by dead - cone effect @xcite and elastic collision energy loss @xcite .",
    "the direct identification of heavy quark hadrons is difficult with current detectors and rhic luminosities",
    ". therefore most previous studies used non - photonic electrons consisting of electrons from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons . a strong suppression of non - photonic electrons , similar to inclusive hadrons , was observed in central au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "the identification uses semileptonic decays of open heavy flavour hadrons ( e.g. @xmath3 ) over broad p@xmath0-range .",
    "these non - photonic electrons keep well direction of the mother heavy hadron when electron has p@xmath4 3 gev / c @xcite .",
    "the purity of electron sample , for electrons with p@xmath0 in range 3 gev / c - 6 gev / c , is above 99% @xcite .    for results presented here , the 0 - 20% central@xcite cu+cu collisions at @xmath1 = 200 gev data measured in 2005 by star are used .",
    "the analysis steps of the electron identification has been reported in details in @xcite . in general ,",
    "charged particle tracks are reconstructed in the tpc @xcite ( time projection chamber ) and electrons can be identified by their tpc ionization energy loss ( 3.31 kev / cm @xmath5 4.64 kev / cm ) . to enlarge the yield of high - p@xmath0 electrons , the high - tower trigger requires , at least , one track s projection into the bemc @xcite ( barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ) with the deposition of its energy above a threshold in a single bemc tower . for cu+cu ,",
    "the high - tower threshold is 3.75 gev . for electron identification ,",
    "the @xmath6 cut was used , where @xmath7 is the tpc momentum of the track and @xmath8 is energy deposited in the bemc tower .",
    "this ratio for electrons should be 1 . to identify electons , the 0.3 @xmath9",
    "1.5 cut was used .",
    "electron yield can be also enlarged by the use of the smd @xcite ( shower maximum detector ) , where electrons are identified by their electromagnetic shower profile that is more broader than for hadrons ( cluster size for electrons @xmath10 2 ) . to avoid the large amount of photon conversion electron background ,",
    "the pseudorapidity range is 0 @xmath11 0.7 .",
    "the major difficulty in the electron analysis is the fact that there are many sources of the electrons other than semileptonic decays of heavy mesons , for instance from photon conversions in the detector material between the interaction point and the tpc and @xmath12 and/or @xmath13 dalitz decays .",
    "these photonic electrons are identified by the invariant mass distribution of electron - positron pairs .",
    "the photonic electron yield is given by the difference between the opposite- and same - sign distribution below the invariant mass cut ( typically @xmath12 mass ) .",
    "the same - sign distribution is due to combinations of random pairs .",
    "the study of the azimuthal non - photonic electron - hadron correlations ( trigger electron with @xmath14 gev / c and associated charged hadron with 0.15@xmath15 gev / c ) uses the semi - inclusive electron sample @xcite , when electrons with the opposite - sign partner with an invariant mass cut are excluded from the inclusive electron sample .",
    "the non - photonic electron - hadron correlations ( @xmath16 ) are obtained by the formula @xmath17 where each term represents correlation functions of the individual electron samples ( si - semi - inclusive , ss - same - sign , and os - opposite - sign ) with charged hadrons and @xmath18 is the efficiency of the photonic electron reconstruction estimated by embedding simulated data into real events ( @xmath18 = 0.665 ) .",
    "eventualy the elliptic flow contribution to the correlation function must be subtracted .",
    "this contribution is given by @xmath19 where a is determined by the zyam @xcite method , @xmath20 is electron and @xmath21 hadron elliptic flows .",
    "we assume that for the most central cu+cu collisions @xmath20 = @xmath21 = 0.05 .",
    "despite large statistical errors , one can see clear correlation structure of non - photonic electrons with hadrons in central ( centrality 0 - 20% ) cu+cu collisions ( fig .",
    "[ pict ] ) . on the nearside ( @xmath22 = 0 )",
    ", the single peak represents the heavy quark fragmentation and possible interaction with medium . on the awayside ( @xmath22 = @xmath23 )",
    ", the correlation function shows a broad modification or possible double - hump structure .",
    "similar pattern can been seen in central au+au collisions ( centrality 0 - 20% ) @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ pict ] ) .",
    "the non - photonic azimuthal electron - hadron correlations at @xmath1 = 200 gev were measured in the 20% most central cu+cu collisions by star . within large statistical errors ,",
    "the comparision of the awayside peak with pythia prediction indicates the broad modification of the awayside peak in both cu+cu and au+au central collisions .",
    "this modification is similar to that was observed in the di - hadron correlations in au+au .",
    "this result may indicate similar response of the nuclear matter produced in central collisions to passage of heavy quarks as well of the light ones .",
