    "the idea of dynamical adjustment of the electroweak vacuum that cancels the @xmath0-angle of qcd @xcite is perhaps the most natural solution to the strong @xmath1 problem .",

    "( [ mass ] ) , any axion model allows for additional derivative type couplings to axial currents @xmath8 of quarks and photons , that obey the shift symmetry of the axion interactions . over the years",
    "a lot of experimental activity has been devoted to detecting axions using interactions of this form .",
    "some methods employ finite cosmological number density of relic axions , while others use the idea of detecting axions that are produced in the solar interior . for a comprehensive review of axion - related phenomenology , see , _",

    "a dedicated search for solar axions , such as cast @xcite , uses conversion of kev - energy axions into x - ray photons in the magnetic field .",
    "although stringent constraints on the axion coupling constant have been imposed by such searches , only recently did they become competitive with the broad range of astrophysical constraints .",
    "an alternative way of detecting solar axions was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . the coupling of axions to electrons can lead to the atomic ionization and therefore be searched with high radio - purity materials in the underground experiments .",
    "recent decade has seen a proliferation of such experiments , that source their main scientific motivation in searching for the nuclear recoil from scattering of weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , a putative component of galactic dark matter .",
    "many of these experiments are also able to detect ionization created by solar axions down to a relevant energy scale of a few kev .",
    "some constraints on solar axions were already imposed by the cdms experiment @xcite .",
    "this analysis was also extended to the absorption of the super - weakly interacting massive particles ( super - wimps ) that may also plausibly be a dark matter candidate @xcite . in case of the pseudoscalar particles ,",
    "the latter possibility departs , of course , from the mass - coupling relation suggested by ( [ mass ] ) . to make the distinction clear",
    ", we shall designate the solar axions as `` massless '' or relativistic , and refer to the massive kev - scale axions as super - wimp possibility .",
    "the constraints on super - wimp axions were improved recently in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "up until this year , the theory of axio - electric effect was using very simplistic formulae relating the cross sections of axion absorption to the photo - electric one @xcite .",
    "earlier this year , the three of us have updated these calculation for the case of the massive axions using the relativistic hartree - fock calculations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the axio - electric effect caused by axions of arbitrary mass , including the relativistic case .",
    "convoluted with the flux of the axions emitted by the solar interior , these results would enable searching / setting limits on the models of light axions that have direct couplings to electrons .",
    "such calculations are especially timely in light of several dark matter experiments have reporting the excess of events over the expected background in the kev region @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite , where the annual modulation of the kev - scale energy deposition is claimed ) .",
    "these results can be generalized to constraints on the emission of other light particles that couple to spin , as _ e.g. _ in models with additional gauge bosons coupled to the spins of electrons @xcite .",
    "the main set - up of our calculation is given in the next section .",
    "section 3 presents the results for the axi - electric cross sections .",
    "section 4 contains calculations of the expected signal from the solar axion absorption , and the appendix provides additional details on atomic calculations .",
    "the hamiltonian for the pseudoscalar axion @xmath9 interacting with electrons can be written in two equivalent ways @xcite ( see also appendix ) @xmath10 where energy scale parameter @xmath6 parameterizes the strength of the interaction , @xmath11 is electron mass , @xmath9 is axion field , @xmath12 is electron dirac field .",
    "following our previous work we present the cross section of the atomic ionization by absorbing an axion in a form which contains a dimensionless function of the axion energy @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an energy scale ( in our calculations @xmath15=1 a.u .",
    "= 27.21 ev , but it can also be any other energy unit ) , @xmath16 is speed of light , @xmath17 is the axion velocity in the laboratory frame , @xmath18 cm is bohr radius , @xmath19 is axion energy .",
    "the function @xmath13 has no unknown parameters and it is to be found from numerical calculations . it can be presented in a form @xmath20 where @xmath16 is a state in atomic core , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are its principal and angular quantum numbers , @xmath23 is an angular quantum number for a state in the continuum .",
    "summation over @xmath24 saturates very rapidly , we cut it at @xmath25 .",
    "we use relativistic hartree - fock method to calculate electron wave functions in the core and in the continuum .",
    "the form of the single - electron matrix element depends on the form of the hamiltonian for the axion - electron interaction ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "the first form ( see formula ( [ eq : taulrmel]-[eq : x - section ] ) in the appendix ) is simple .",
    "however , it often leads to unstable results .",
    "this is due to strong cancellation between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 terms in the radial integral .",
    "the cancellation is of the order of @xmath28 which means that the formula can be reliably used only for heavy atoms ( e.g. , xe ) .",
    "second form of the single - electron matrix element ( see formulas ( [ eq : tauprimelrmel ] ) , ( [ eq : tauprimelrmel1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tausreduced ] ) in the appendix ) is more complicated .",
    "however it is more convenient for the calculations since it gives stable results . in spite of some numerical problems , comparing calculations with two different expressions",
    "is a valuable test of the calculations .",
    "two forms of the hamiltonian must give the same results when exact electron wave functions are used .",
    "since we use the hartree - fock wave functions we can have only approximate agreement between results . therefore , comparing the results is not only a test for the computer code but also a test for the quality of the wave functions used . in our experience",
    "the results agree within 10% for the cases when first form gives stable answers .",
    "the term `` stable '' means that variation of the axion energy leads to smooth change in the absorption cross section .",
    "note that all formulas in the appendix are for a closed - shell atom .",
    "however , this is inessential in our case .",
    "we consider axion energies ( @xmath29  kev ) for which the effect is strongly dominated by inner closed shells while contribution from open valence shells is small and can be neglected .",
    "this means that the results can be used for any atom or ion with closed inner shells .",
    "they can also be used for molecules and condensed matter systems since inner atomic states depend very little on the environment .    in our present calculations",
    "the axion absorption cross section depends on its mass .",
    "the only expression which depends on axion mass explicitly is the expression for the axion wave vector @xmath30 in an extreme case of heavy axion ( @xmath31 ) , axion wave vector @xmath32 and only term with @xmath33 contributes to the summation in ( [ eq : k ] ) .",
    "this case was considered in our previous work  @xcite . in present work",
    "we consider both these cases .",
    "first case gives us a test for the computer code .",
    "the results are the same as in our previous calculations  @xcite .",
    "second case gives new results for axion absorption cross section by atoms . according to ref .",
    "@xcite the ratio of the absorption probabilities for these two extreme cases is equal to 2/3 in the non - relativistic limit @xmath34 below we will discuss relativistic corrections to this formula .",
    ".hartree - fock energies of the core states of na , ar , ge , i and xe ( atomic units , 1 a.u.= 27.21 ev ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figures [ fig : ar],[fig : ge ] and [ fig : xe ] show the results of the relativistic hartree - fock calculations for ar , ge and xe of the dimensionless function of the axion energy @xmath13 which stands in the expression for the cross section of atom ionization by axion ( see formula ( [ eq : csa ] ) ) . many body and relativistic effects beyond the rhf method are ignored and the final electron state in the continuum is calculated in the same potential as initial core state .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation is few percents due to dominating contribution from the inner - most core states @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for these states",
    "the many - body effects are small due to strong nuclear field .",
    "solid lines on figures [ fig : ar ] , [ fig : ge ] and [ fig : xe ] correspond to the case when all axion energy is due to its mass ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "this is the same case as was considered in are previous work  @xcite .",
    "dotted line corresponds to the case of the massless axion ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "one can see that the ratio of the cross sections is indeed close to 2/3 at low energies ( see formula ( [ eq:23 ] ) ) . however , the ratio becomes larger at high energies .",
    "for sufficiently high axion energy the absorption cross section for massless axion becomes larger than those for a massive axion .",
    "this is due to the relativistic effects .",
    "we found a formula for the ratio of the cross sections which fits very well the numerical calculations .",
    "the formula reads @xmath40 here @xmath41 is nuclear charge , @xmath19 is axion energy , @xmath42 is the energy of the deepest electron state in the core for which ionization is possible .",
    "note that all states in the core have negative energies , therefore ionization threshold corresponds to the condition @xmath43 .",
    "hartree - fock energies of all core states for na , ar , ge , i and xe are presented in table  [ tab : en ] .",
    "the @xmath15 parameter in ( [ eq:23rel ] ) is the energy unit .",
    "first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq:23rel ] ) corresponds to the non - relativistic limit ; second term is the relativistic correction due to core electrons ; last term is the relativistic correction due to the kinetic energy of the escaping electron .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite we presented an analytical formula which is an accurate fit of the numerical calculations of the absorption cross section for the massive axion .",
    "the formula can be used for wide range of atoms and axion energies .",
    "the formula reads @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the fine structure constant , @xmath41 is nuclear charge , @xmath19 is axion energy , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the hartree - fock energies of the core states .",
    "hartree - fock energies of the @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath54 states of many - electron atoms can be found using extrapolation formulas : @xmath55 the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 in ( [ eq : k1s],[eq : k2s],[eq : k2p ] ) are scaling functions : @xmath58 to find a cross section for massless axion one should take formula ( [ eq : kt ] ) and multiply it by the factor @xmath59 given by ( [ eq:23rel ] ) .",
    "therefore , for the massless axion we also have the results which cover the same range of atoms and energies as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "to calculate the rate of the axio - electric effect caused by solar axions , we first address the issue of the total axion flux .",
    "both continuous and line - like emission is possible . here",
    "we take into account the emission of solar axions due to their couplings to nucleons , to photons and to electrons . the easiest case",
    "to address is the nuclear case , as it leads to a characteristic @xmath60 kev emission due the nuclear transition of the @xmath61fe nucleus @xcite .",
    "the solar axion flux was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where cast results were also used to constrain it in combination with coupling of axions to photons ) . at earth",
    "this flux is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is some effective coupling constant to nucleons that can be related to the coupling of axions to quark spins .",
    "the expected counting rates of argon , germanium and xenon experiments are given by @xmath64 where the following values for the @xmath65-factors are used : @xmath66 these rates should provide the sensitivity to @xmath67 in the window between @xmath68 and @xmath69 gev .",
    "similar strength constraints were derived in the recent work @xcite , where a @xmath70 annual modulation of the axion signal was exploited in conjunction with dama results .",
    "( unlike the signal from wimp dark matter that is expected to have a maximum in june , the solar axion signal is minimized in early july . )",
    "we leave it to the experimental collaborations to determine the exact upper limits on solar axions ensuing from their results .",
    "if the coupling to photons is not zero , @xmath71 , then we can calculate the counting rate , using the axion flux provided in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath72 counting rate for the axio - electric effect is given by the product of the calculated absorption cross section and the flux ( [ eq : flux ] ) .",
    "for @xmath73 normalized on @xmath74 gev , we get the counting rates plotted in figure [ fig : rates ] .",
    "integration over axion energy leads to the following total counting rates @xmath75    comparing this to the counting rate of the cdms experiment @xcite , one can see that the equivalent of @xmath76 gev are being probed , as the counting rates in the window from 1.5 to 4 kev reach @xmath77 .",
    "similar sensitivity is achieved in the cogent experiment @xcite .",
    "finally , the axion flux can be created by the emission of the axions due to the same interaction that leads to atomic ionization . in this case , however , the production cross section is down by additional factor of @xmath78 @xcite , and the sensitivity to @xmath6 in this case does not exceed @xmath68 gev .",
    "qcd axions represent one of the most well - motivated extensions of the standard model .",
    "their light mass and small couplings allow them to be produced in the solar interior and escape reaching the earth . with the proliferation of the low - background searches of dark matter , one should also conduct searches of solar axions . in this paper",
    "we have calculated the cross sections relevant for these searches , improving upon the simple scaling relations that tie the axio - electric and photo - electric effects .",
    "last two years has brought a significant progress in sensitivity to any ionizing effects in germanium in the window from 1 to 10 kev @xcite .",
    "currently , the cogent experiment has very low backgrounds in the window from 2 to 4 kev , where the solar axion signal is expected to peak . with acquiring more statistics , the sensitivity to the solar axions in this experiment is poised to grow .",
    "we also remark at this point that the excess of events recorded by cogent below 1 kev does not fit the expected shape of the spectrum from solar axions .",
    "future progress in searching for solar axions may also come from the large scale detectors with self - shielding capabilities .",
    "this work was supported in part by the australian research council , and the nserc of canada .",
    "research at perimeter institute is also supported in part by nserc and by the province of ontario through medt .",
    "there are two equivalent expressions for the lagrangian describing coupling of pseudoscalar axions of mass @xmath79 to electrons @xmath80 here @xmath12 is the electronic wave function and @xmath81 is a coupling constant . the axion field @xmath9 may be represented as @xmath82 with the dispersion relation@xmath83 and @xmath84 being the normalization constant .",
