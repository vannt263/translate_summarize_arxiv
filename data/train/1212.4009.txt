    "<S> it is clear that the potential generated by these six @xmath62 ions breaks cubic symmetry even in the absence of trigonal distortions . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results we obtain show that due to the large ionic charge at the @xmath5 sites and the large spatial extent of the iridium 5@xmath8 orbitals the anisotropic , planar @xmath63 coordination actually has by far a stronger effect on the @xmath9 level splitting than the trigonal distortion of the iro@xmath4 cages .    to bolster this conclusion , an underlying assumption </S>",
    "<S>  the interpretation of the excitation energies @xmath64 in terms of an effective @xmath51 model  requires crosschecking . </S>",
    "<S> we can do so by calculating the @xmath9 crystal - field splittings directly by switching off the soc in the quantum - chemical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations show that the ground - state wave function has @xmath65 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-level splittings without soc s ( see table ii ) are only marginally different between the distorted , experimental crystal structure ( @xmath61 ) and the idealized , undistorted one ( @xmath60 ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides thus confirming that the @xmath3 splittings are due to anisotropy potentials beyond the nearest - neighbor ligand coordination shell , the values computed without soc s also bring additional insight into the magnitude of these splittings . whereas the effective values for @xmath34 in the @xmath51 model and rixs data are 0.540.59 ev , the _ ab initio _ calculations without soc yield @xmath66 ev , i.e. , values about a factor two lower . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that in the pyrochlore iridates the effect of the relativistic spin - orbit coupling can not be captured by oversimplified single - ion models like the @xmath51 model . </S>",
    "<S> additional degrees of freedom , in particular the @xmath67 couplings , the presence of anisotropic spin - orbit interactions @xcite and the hybridization of the ir @xmath9 states with other orbitals in the system must be considered .    _ conclusions  _ our experimental and theoretical demonstration of the presence of large ir @xmath9 splittings in pyrochlore iridates which arise from longer - range crystal anisotropy  @xcite and that directly compete with spin - orbit interactions , does not only change the canonical view that only , potentially weak , local distortions of iro@xmath4 octahedra tend to quench the spin - orbit coupling in these iridium pyrochlores . </S>",
    "<S> the broader ramification is that the rather extended nature of the @xmath3 wave functions renders the longer - range anisotropy fields to be of fundamental importance throughout the @xmath3 transition metal series . </S>",
    "<S> their physical effect is particularly striking when the local ligand field symmetry is high , e.g. cubic or close - to - cubic , but the point group symmetry in the crystal is lower . </S>",
