    "the much higher critical temperature observed experimentally led to the suggestion that under pressure hydrogen sulfide decomposes into a hydride with a stoichiometry that is not stable at 1  atm , and this new phase is responsible for the remarkably high @xmath8 @xcite . indeed , first principles - calculations @xcite confirmed that the @xmath8 ( computed using the allen - dynes modified mcmillan equation ) of a novel @xmath12-h@xmath13s phase matched exceedingly well with what was observed by drozdov and co - workers . a plethora of theoretical calculations have verified that the h@xmath13s stoichiometry is indeed the most stable at these pressures , analyzed the factors contributing to @xmath8 , examined anharmonicity as well as the isotope effect , and computed @xmath8 for the related compounds selenium hydride and tellurium hydride @xcite .",
    "these studies highlight that new hydrogen - rich materials can be attained under pressure , some of which may have a @xmath8 higher than those previously thought possible for bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)-type superconductors @xcite , and have invigorated the search for high - temperature superconductivity in high - pressure hydrides .",

    "<S> evolutionary algorithms ( ea ) coupled with density functional theory ( dft ) calculations have been used to predict the most stable hydrides of phosphorous ( ph@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) at 100 , 150 and 200  gpa . at these pressures </S>",
    "<S> phosphine is unstable with respect to decomposition into the elemental phases , as well as ph@xmath2 and h@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> three metallic ph@xmath2 phases were found to be dynamically stable and superconducting between 100 - 200  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> one of these contains five formula units in the primitive cell and has @xmath3 symmetry ( 5fu-@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is comprised of 1d periodic ph@xmath4-ph - ph@xmath5-ph - ph@xmath4 oligomers . </S>",
    "<S> two structurally related phases consisting of phosphorous atoms that are octahedrally coordinated by four phosphorous atoms in the equatorial positions and two hydrogen atoms in the axial positions ( @xmath6 and 2fu-@xmath3 ) were the most stable phases between @xmath7160 - 200  gpa . their superconducting critical temperatures ( @xmath8 ) were computed as being 70 and 76  k , respectively , via the allen - dynes modified mcmillan formula and using a value of 0.1 for the coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the superconductivity recently observed by drozdov , eremets and troyan when phosphine was subject to pressures of 207  gpa in a diamond anvil cell may result from these , and other , decomposition products of phosphine . </S>"
