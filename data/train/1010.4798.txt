    "non - abelian gauge theories are expected to exist in a number of different phases which can be classified according to the force measured between two static sources .",
    "the knowledge of this phase diagram is relevant for the construction of extensions of the standard model ( sm ) that invoke dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "an up - to - date review is @xcite while earlier reviews are @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram is also useful in providing ultraviolet completions of unparticle @xcite models @xcite and it has been investigated recently using different analytical methods @xcite .    here",
    "we wish to understand , in a rigorous way , the dynamics of gauge theories lying in the conformal window at nonzero temperature .",
    "the physical applications are numerous ranging from the above mentioned models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking to cosmology @xcite .",
    "thermodynamical properties of these gauge theories were also investigated in the literature using holographic models @xcite .",
    "our starting point are asymptotically free vector - like gauge theories near the banks - zaks infrared stable fixed point @xcite .",
    "the presence of such a perturbative fixed point allows a controllable computation of the free energy for these theories which we carry till order @xmath4 in the gauge coupling .",
    "in fact we expect perturbation theory to work , in principle , for any temperature in contrast to the case of a _ confining _ theory for which perturbation theory is limited to asymptotically large temperatures compared to its intrinsic scale .",
    "the absence of an intrinsic scale in the theory is evident in having a free energy directly proportional to the fourth power of the temperature , for any temperature .",
    "we will trade the value of the coupling with its value at the infrared fixed point turning the coefficient of @xmath5 into an algebraic expression of the number of flavors , colors and matter representation , encoding a great deal of information of the underlying gauge theory .    despite the fact that we can keep the coupling constant small",
    "it is a fact that perturbation theory breaks down , at finite temperature , due to the loss of analyticity in the coupling associated to the presence of infrared singularities . for the free energy this problem sets in at @xmath6 , or four - loop order@xcite .",
    "at best one can assume that the free energy is computable to @xmath6 , though not via loop diagrams .",
    "the highest order one can achieve using feynman diagrams is @xmath7 and was recently determined in @xcite .",
    "we adapt their results for the case of gauge theories featuring large distance conformality while generalizing the discussion to any matter representation , different number of colors and flavors .",
    "we discover a number of surprising features when plotting the free energy , for a given matter representation , as function of the number of flavors : i ) there is a change in sign of the free energy at a critical number of flavors whose value depends on the representation it belongs and the order to which the computations were carried , ii)this number is smaller than the one for which asymptotic freedom is lost .",
    "it is tempting to identify it with the critical number of flavors below which , at zero temperature , conformality is lost .",
    "the obvious caveat is that as we decrease the number of flavors away from the point when asymptotic freedom is lost perturbation theory ceases to be reliable and therefore we interpret this phenomenon only as _ strong _ indication that the finite temperature free energy is aware of the nontrivial underlying gauge dynamics .",
    "another amusing feature is that at the two - loops level , when the results are scheme independent , the change in sign of the free energy occurs for a given number of flavors which is surprisingly close to the one predicted using the schwinger - dyson results @xcite as well as the ryttov - sannino @xmath8 function @xcite .",
    "this value becomes larger when going to the fifth and sixth order in the coupling .",
    "the perturbative free energy at finite temperatures was computed to order @xmath9 in @xcite and in the @xmath10 scheme .",
    "the result was derived using an effective field theory approach utilizing matching of coefficients in the effective theory expression with the dimensionally regularized perturbative expansion .",
    "an in depth presentation of the method can be found in @xcite , where the order @xmath11 was recomputed . in order to present the results in a",
    "relatively self - contained way we briefly review the method here .    the perturbative free energy for a massless asymptotically free gauge theory receives contributions from the following three mass scales : @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "they are respectively , the particle momentum in the plasma , the onset of the color - electric ( debye ) screening and finally the onset of color - magnetic screening .",
    "the idea is then to construct an effective field theory that reproduce static observables at the different scales .",
    "this is done by the method of dimensional reduction , where the static properties of a @xmath15-dimensional field theory at high temperatures are expressed in terms of an effective field theory in @xmath16 space dimensions@xcite .",
    "the free energy density expressing the static equilibrium properties of the plasma is given by the usual logarithm of the partition function : @xmath17 as it is customary to introduce finite temperature by euclideanizing the time dimension @xmath18 and compactifying it with a period @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the temperature , and the bosonic ( fermionic ) fields respecting periodic ( antiperiodic ) boundary conditions . in regimes",
    "when the gauge coupling , @xmath21 is small the free energy density can be computed perturbatively .",
    "on the other hand , by dimensional reduction one can compute the free energy density using an effective field theory in @xmath16 space dimensions , by seperating the electro- and magnetostatic parts of the lagrangian .",
    "the free energy density is expressed as @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective free energy densities @xmath23 and @xmath24 represents the contributions from the three scales , i.e. @xmath25 gives the contribution from the momentum scale by effectively integrating out the fermions and the high momentum degrees of freedom down to the scale @xmath26 corresponding to a distance of order @xmath27 . at greater distances the fields",
    "are replaced by electrostatic and magnetostatic gauge fields @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are proportional to the zero - frequency modes of the gauge fields @xmath30 that are the only fields able to propagate over such distances@xcite .",
    "@xmath25 is then the normalization for this transition , i.e. @xmath31 where the lagrangian is now an effective electrostatic lagrangian : @xmath32 ^ 2 + m_e^2 \\text{tr } a_0 ^ 2\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\lambda_e^{(1 ) } \\left[\\text{tr}(a_0 ^ 2)\\right]^2 + \\lambda_e^{(2 ) } \\text{tr}a_0 ^ 4 + \\delta \\mathcal{l}_e.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath33 represents higher order interaction terms which contributes beyond the order @xmath34 .",
    "shorthand notation has been used for the gauge fields , i.e @xmath35 and the corresponding gauge coupling is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "this lagrangian defines @xmath37 which is dependent on the still lower momentum scale @xmath38 , corresponding to the distance @xmath39 .",
    "again at greater distances , only the magnetostatic gauge fields play a role : @xmath40 with the effective magnetostatic lagrangian @xmath41 containing the gauge coupling @xmath42 .",
    "note that the direct identification of the normalization functions @xmath25 and @xmath37 with the free energy densities of the respective lagrangians is strictly true only when using dimensional regularization to cut off the ultraviolet and infrared divergences in the perturbation expansions . in the same sense , @xmath24 is identified with the integral expression in the above partition function .",
    "the lagrangian defines a confining theory when the higher order terms are not considered and is thus non - perturbative .",
    "however , @xmath24 can still be expressed as a power series in @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the leading order is proportional to @xmath43 and the coefficient can be determined by lattice computations only .",
    "however , the logarithmic ultraviolet divergence coming from the scale @xmath38 can be evaluated exactly by matching the coefficient with that in @xmath37 , since the expression must be scale invariant . in this way one",
    "proceeds backwards and matches all coefficient with appropriate tuning to get rid of the somewhat arbitrary momentum scales .",
    "finally one ends up with an exact expression for the free energy to order @xmath44 , while the order @xmath34 coefficient remains unknown and uncomputable from perturbation methods .",
    "one also shifts the scale of the coupling constant from the dimensional regularization scale to an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath45 by using the renormalization group equation for the running of the coupling constant .",
    "we here express the leading order magnitudes only and refer to @xcite for the full result .",
    "@xmath46 note that the perturbation expansion parameter in @xmath47 is @xmath48 which is of order @xmath21 .",
    "thus the perturbation expansion by this method is an expansion in @xmath21 rather than @xmath2 .",
    "our starting point is a generic asymptotically free gauge theory with @xmath50 dirac flavors transforming according to the representation @xmath51 of the underlying gauge group .",
    "we will consider , to this order , also the case of @xmath52 supersymmetric gauge theories for reasons which will become clearer shortly .    to be more specific , throughout this paper we will consider matter transforming according to four different but single representations , i.e. the adjoint representation ( denoted @xmath53 ) under the gauge group @xmath54 , the fundamental representation under the gauge groups @xmath55 and @xmath54 , the two - index symmetric representation under the gauge group @xmath55 and the two - index antisymmetric representation under the gauge group @xmath56 .",
    "the relevant group normalization factors are : @xmath57   = t[r ] \\delta^{ab } , \\qquad   t^a_r t^a_r = c_2[r ] \\mathbf{1},\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the @xmath59-th group generator in the representation @xmath51 and @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "we denote with @xmath61 $ ] the dimension of the representation .",
    "@xmath62 $ ] and @xmath63 $ ] are related via the identity @xmath63 d[r ] = t[r ] d[g]$ ] . in table",
    "[ groupfactors ] , for completeness , we list the normalization used for the group factors in the different representations .",
    "we list in the last column also the number of colors which will be considered .",
    "the normalizations were taken from @xcite .",
