    "clusters of galaxies remain a valuable venue for study .",
    "morphology and evolution of galaxies differ in clusters from the field ( e.g. , hubble & humason 1931 , oemler 1974 , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) . as the nearest large cluster",
    ", the virgo cluster offers the opportunity for studying details of environmental effects on galaxy kinematics .",
    "virgo studies began over two centuries ago , when messier ( 1784 ) noted the concentration of nebulae ( @xmath6sans etoile \" ) in virgo . yet 150 years passed before shapley and ames ( 1932 and references therein ) initiated a large - scale study of the properties of galaxies in the cluster region .",
    "the most extensive study of galaxies in the virgo cluster is due to binggeli , sandage and tammann ( 1985 , 1987 , bst ; called vcc for virgo cluster catalogue ) , who cataloged 2100 galaxies in the virgo region , and identified 1277 as members .",
    "virgo galaxies have also been studied with h@xmath7 images ( kennicutt & kent 1983 ; koopmann & kenney 1998 , 1999 ) , integrated hi profiles ( giovanelli & haynes 1983 ; helou , hoffman , & salpeter 1984 ; warmels 1988 ; cayatte et al .",
    "1990 ) , co ( kenney & young 1989 ) , radio continuum ( kotanyi 1980 ) , and x - ray ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "surveys of virgo galaxy properties and comparisons with non - cluster galaxies provide evidence that within the core ( @xmath86@xmath9 ) of the cluster , galaxies are subjected to environmental effects , such as galaxy - cluster and galaxy - galaxy tidal interactions , mergers , gas accretion , collisions , and gas stripping by the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "many processes operate in clusters ( oemler 1992 ; valluri 1993 ; moore et al . 1996 ; kenney & koopmann 1999 ; barton et al .",
    "1999 ) , although we do not yet know which are dominant , nor the precise evolutionary effects on the disturbed galaxies .",
    "the virgo cluster is not yet in overall dynamical equilibrium , although some galaxy populations within it are more relaxed than others .",
    "there are significant sub - structures in the cluster , further evidence of a lack of dynamical equilibrium ( bst 1985 , 1987 , huchra 1885 ) .",
    "while the ellipticals and lenticulars have a gaussian distribution of line - of - sight ( l - o - s ) systemic velocities indicating that they may be in the process of establishing a relaxed population , the spirals have a complex , multi - peaked distribution ( huchra 1985 ) suggesting that they may be clumped into discrete subunits ( sandage , tammann , & binggeli ( 1985 ) .",
    "many of them may be presently arriving into the cluster on elongated orbits ( huchra 1985 ) .",
    "tully & shaya ( 1984 ) employed a flow model for the local supercluster , offering evidence that many spirals in the general region of the virgo cluster ( including the milky way ) are on orbits which will carry them into the virgo cluster , some within a fraction of a gyr .",
    "internal galaxy kinematics are sensitive to tidal interactions , yet there are few previous measures of gravitational interactions within a single cluster population .",
    "hence , some years ago we embarked on a program to obtain ccd optical long - slit spectra for disk galaxies in the virgo cluster . from these high spectral resolution emission line spectra",
    ", we determine rotation curves and study the ionized gas kinematics for s0@xmath3sm galaxies .",
    "our data are well - suited to study irregularities in velocity fields , which trace disturbances in the galaxies gravitational potentials .",
    "non - axisymmetric and non - bisymmetric features in the velocity fields are likely due to tidal events , whether high or low velocity encounters / collisions , mergers , or accretion events .",
    "tidal interactions produce a non - bisymmetric disturbance when ( m / m)(r / r)@xmath10 between the perturbee and the perturber are large ; ( m / m ) is the ratio of the masses , and ( r / r ) is the ratio of the radius of the perturber to the distances between the two galaxies .",
    "thus galaxy - cluster tidal effects and near galaxy - galaxy tidal encounters between galaxies with nearly similar masses are more likely to produce non - bisymmetric disturbances . we think that these types of disturbances are responsible for most kinematic irregularities we discuss in this paper . since m=2 structure is common in galaxies , the m=2 mode must be fairly long - lived , and can not unambiguously tell us about recent interactions .",
    "in contrast , most other non - axisymmetric kinematic disturbances smooth out in several rotation periods . hence disturbed",
    "kinematics identify galaxies in which gravitational disturbances have taken place within the last billion years .",
    "in this paper , we present major axis velocity data for 89 virgo galaxies ( plus one galaxy with only a minor axis spectrum ) , rotation curves for 81 , and minor axis velocities for 42 .",
    "galaxy properties and a journal of observations are compiled in table 1 . for an additional 14 galaxies ,",
    "most of early type located in the central dense markarian chain , emission is undetected or possibly detected only in the nucleus ( table 1 notes ) .",

    "7181 ( 276 km s@xmath4 ) were called background by bst . although their low rotation velocities imply faint absolute magnitudes , they plot within the scatter of virgo galaxies on a tully - fisher plot .",

    "their velocities range from 637 to 1114 km s@xmath4 , except ngc 4866 with v@xmath2=1994 km s@xmath4 , and suggest that these are in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "contamination from non - cluster galaxies is expected to be minimal .",

    "it is disappointing that _ stellar _ rotation velocities exist for only 9 of these galaxies : ngc 4374 ( davies & birkinshaw 1988 ) , n4435 ( simien & prugniel 1997 ) , n4450 and n4569 ( filmore , boroson , & dressler 1986 ) , 4459 ( peterson 1978 ) , n4477 ( jarvis et al .",

    "five additional galaxies have rc3 velocities , but we follow roberts et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and do not accept as detections ngc 4293 , 4374 , 4506 , and 4550 .",
    "for example , the 21-cm velocity attributed in rc3 to ngc 4374 is an old measure , unsubstantiated by new , more sensitive observations ( huchtmeier & richter 1989 ) ; it is 181 km s@xmath4 lower than our emission line velocities .",
    "the fifth galaxy , ngc 4526 , is undetected in hi ( kumar & thonnard 1983 ) , but detected in co ( sage & wrobel 1989 ) , with a broad velocity range .",
    "the agreement of our velocities with rc3 _ optical _ velocities is sometimes poor , ( e.g. , v@xmath16v@xmath18 @xmath15 300 km s@xmath4 in 2 cases ) , due to large uncertainties in older values .    rotation velocities , ( v@xmath19v@xmath2)/sin @xmath20 , as a function of nuclear distances are shown ( fig .",
    "7 ) for 77 galaxies ; the galaxies are arranged according to angular extent of measured emission .",
    "we assume circular , planar orbits . to transform from angular to linear distances ( upper axis , fig .",
    "7 ) , we adopt m@xmath3m=31.0 , so the cluster distance is 15.8 mpc ( jacoby et al .",
    "1992 ; freedman et al . 1994 ) and 1@xmath12=77 pc , but this choice is irrelevant to our discussion .",
    "major axis rotation velocities for all galaxies , and velocities along minor axes and other observed position angles , are available in ascii form from the aj data bank .",
    "the first page of data is shown in table 3 .",
    "for a few galaxies with uncertain inclinations , we set i = xx in table 1 , and only ( v@xmath19v@xmath2 ) is tabulated in the file .    as our paper was nearing completion , the spectacular hst long slit ( stis ) spectrum of ngc 4374 ( m84 , e1 ) was obtained by bower et al .",
    "we compare with some amusement our measured ground based velocities with the hst measures ( fig . 8) .",
    "although slit widths differ by a factor of 10 ( 2.0@xmath12 vs. 0.2@xmath12 ) , and exposures correspondingly ( 600s vs. @xmath85000s ) , except for the all - important sub - arcsecond velocity peak , the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "this comparison supports the maxim that a factor of ten improvement leads to discovery .",
    "success in detecting extended emission depends on the instrument , the weather , the integration time , and the galaxy . for our spectra , the combination of relatively high spectral resolution and long exposures results in a relatively high s / n , especially for the nuclear and hii regions ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "hence , we believe that the measured radial extent depends principally on the morphological type and the environmental history of each galaxy .    the extent of measured emission as a function of hubble type is illustrated in fig .",
    "the distance of the farthest measured point along the major axis , r@xmath21 , relative to the isophotal radius r@xmath22 ( table 1 ) , ranges from a low of 0.02 for ngc 4374 ( e1 ) to 1.40 for ugc 7590 ( sbc ) . as expected , the median value increases , from r@xmath21/r@xmath23 0.3 for s0 galaxies , to @xmath8 0.7 for sb and sc .",
    "note , however , that the assigned hubble type of some galaxies in virgo is misleading , since many galaxies classified sa are actually disk systems with small bulges and low sfrs ( koopmann & kenney 1998 ) .",
    "this may increase the scatter in fig .",
    "galaxies with no detected emission , or only possible nuclear emission ( table 1 notes ) are included in the plot .",
    "rotation curve forms are discussed in section 5 below .    to illustrate the combined effects of hubble type and distance from the cluster core ( fig .",
    "10 ) , we show the extent of detected emission as a function of projected galaxy distance from m87 . for e and s0 galaxies ,",
    "emission extents vary from 0 to almost 0.4r@xmath22 , with little dependence upon distance from m87 .",
    "in contrast , sa spirals show a large variation with core distance . at 1@xmath24 from m87 , emission extent varies from 0 to 0.7r@xmath22 ( mean=0.25r@xmath22 ) . in the 3@xmath25 zone , emission extent increases to 0.2@xmath31.0r@xmath22 ( mean=0.55r@xmath22 ) . for types sb - sd , the emission extents are lower within 2@xmath9 of m87 , and higher , between 3@xmath9and 6@xmath9 from m87 .",
    "thus the well known property of spirals near the virgo core to have stripped outer neutral gas disks ( haynes , giovanelli , & chincarini 1984 ; warmels 1988 ; cayatte et al .",
    "1990 ) is seen also in the ionized gas in many virgo spirals ( section 5 below ; koopmann & kenney 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "from these relatively high accuracy rotation curves for virgo spirals , there are three properties which we can study .",
    "the simplest procedure is to classify the form of each rotation curve as regular or disturbed , and to examine its relation to other galaxy parameters .",
    "this is the primary goal of this paper .",
    "a more difficult parameter to evaluate is vmax ; we do this in the following section .",
    "the most difficult parameter to determine is m , the absolute magnitude of each galaxy , via vmax and tully - fisher relation calibrators ; we do not attempt this here .    as expected for galaxies in regions of high density , many virgo cluster galaxies exhibit complex velocity curves .",
    "abnormalities consist generally of : asymmetrical rotation velocities on the two sides of the major axis , falling outer velocities , inner velocity peculiarities , dips in the rotation velocities at intermediate radii , or velocities near zero for the near nuclear gas .",
    "although forms are classified by a comparison with the synthetic rotation curves ( src ) from our earlier studies ( thonnard & rubin 1981 ; rubin et al .",
    "1985 ) , disturbed forms are easily identified from knowledge of what normal rotation curves looks like .",
    "we review the formation of src in section 6 .",
    "examples of velocity curves are shown in fig .",
    "ngc 4419 has a normal rotation pattern for a high luminosity sa .",
    "in contrast , the starburst galaxy ngc 4383 ( amorphous ) has an unusually shallow nuclear velocity rise .",
    "the h@xmath7+[nii ] image of ngc  4383 shows filaments of ionized gas , suggesting significant non - circular gas motions due to the starburst ( koopmann et al .",
    "the asymmetrical outer major axis velocities in ngc 4567 ( sc ) are probably tidally induced , rising steeply only on the ne where its close companion , ngc 4568 , is superposed .",
    "ngc 4498 has a relatively normal velocity pattern on the nw but not on the se ; it has an irregular morphology with the outer galaxy off - center and warped ( koopmann et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting a strong gravitational interaction .    for 81 galaxies , we have classified the major axis rotation curve form as regular ( 38 ) or disturbed ( 43 : table 4 , fig .",
    "we attempt a quasi - quantitative measure of the irregularities , and call a rotation curve disturbed if we detect a distortion of order 15% or larger in velocity , extending over 1 kpc or more , in comparison with the src .",
    "minor axis velocities help with difficult decisions .",
    "if only the outermost velocity is discrepant , the rotation curve is not classified falling or disturbed , for outermost points are notoriously difficult to measure .",
    "rotation curve forms are not assigned for 5 bcd galaxies , and 3 others with few measured points . with this classification , we make the following conclusions .    \\1 .",
    "_ one - half of the ( mostly spiral ) virgo cluster galaxies we observed have rotation patterns called regular , while about 50% exhibit more complex internal kinematics , which we label disturbed_. abnormalities include asymmetrical rotation velocities on the two sides of the major axis , falling outer velocities , inner velocity peculiarities , dips in the rotation velocities at intermediate radii , or velocities all near zero at small radii .",
    "for example , the sc galaxies ngc  4567 and ngc  4568 ( sometimes called the siamese twins ) , an apparent pair with similar l - o - s velocities , both show signs of kinematic disturbance .",
    "although ngc  4567 is significantly disturbed , the larger ngc  4568 shows peculiar velocities only in the outermost data points , and thus is classified as regular by our criteria .",
    "ngc  4647 ( sc ) and ngc  4649 ( e ) form an apparent pair with similar velocities . while ngc  4647 exhibits an asymmetric h@xmath7 morphology suggesting a tidal interaction ( koopmann & kenney 1999 ) , its kinematics appear nearly normal .",
    "enough time may not have elapsed for the kinematic disturbance to be maximally manifest .",
    "the largest kinematic disturbances often appear after closest approach ( toomre & toomre 1972 , moore et al .",
    "1997 ) ; galaxies with mild disturbances may be at early stages of their interactions .    at the opposite end of the interaction time scale are old encounters . ngc  4550 and ngc  4698 , with counterrotating or misaligned stellar components , have fairly normal rotation curves .",
    "each merger probably occured a sufficiently long time ago that the velocity fields have become regular .",
    "complex rotation patterns can arise from galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "self - consistent n - body models which explore the first pass of two disk galaxies ( barton , et al .",
    "1999 ) produce rotation curves with bumps and dips in the mid regions , and outer portions which rise or fall differently on the two sides of the major axis , much like those we observe .",
    "but kinematic disturbances from galaxy - cluster interactions might also produce similar effects .",
    "models of disk galaxies falling for the first time into the cluster mean tidal field show ( valluri 1993 ) show that m=1 ( warp ) and m=2 ( bar and spiral arms ) perturbations result .",
    "although we do not attempt to distinguish galaxy - galaxy from galaxy - cluster effects , it is noteworthy that eight of our sample galaxies are predicted to fall into virgo ( tully and shaya 1984 ) with time scales ranging from 0.1 to 2.2 gyr ( median 0.5 gyr ) , and seven of these have rotation forms classified as disturbed .",
    "of these eight , 2 are called cluster members , 4 possible members , and 2 are outside the vcc boundaries ( bst ) .",
    "gravitationally disturbed galaxies will return to regular , axisymmetric or bisymmetric kinematics in a few rotation periods , @xmath261 gyr .",
    "consequently , significant kinematic disturbances must occur at least once per 1 gyr for galaxies in virgo .",
    "most of these galaxies have likely had several significant tidal encounters during their lifetime .",
    "this conclusion is broadly consistent with the results of simulations which show frequent galaxy - galaxy tidal encounters in clusters ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "while there are few statistics on the fraction of _ field _ spirals with disturbed rotation curves , the virgo set appears unlike those observed in ( nominally ) field spirals .",
    "the galaxies we studied earlier ( rubin et al .",
    "1980 , 1982 , 1985 ) were chosen to have no near neighbors , and to have relatively normal , unbarred morphology .",
    "a reexamination of their rotation curves reveals that most ( 74% ) of them , 11 of 14 sa , 14 of 22 sb , and 16 of 21 sc , are _ very _ regular .",
    "the remaining curves have minimal disturbances . only two or three show the large scale disturbances we see in some of the virgo galaxies .",
    "hence we feel secure in attributing the kinematic distortions to the cluster environment .",
    "other statistics of kinematically disturbed spirals are fragmentary . based only on _ morphology _ in the visual , zaritsky and rix , ( 1997 ) and infrared , odewahn ( 1996 ) ,",
    "the fraction of disturbed field spirals has been estimated from 15% to 50% . from studies of non - symmetrical integrated hi profiles , haynes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated the fraction of disturbed galaxies to be high , near 50% .",
    "however , hi profiles arise from a integration of the velocity and the hi distributions ; resolved hi observations offer more direct information . a study by swaters et al .",
    "( 1999 ) based on kinematically resolved hi observations of lopsided galaxies discusses data for only two such galaxies , but also estimates the disturbed fraction to be at least 50% .",
    "the fraction of galaxies which are classified as disturbed in a given study depends on the criteria for disturbance and the range of galactocentric radii considered .",
    "since these vary among the studies cited , we can not directly compare our disturbed fraction with others .",
    "_ there is no strong correlation of rotation curve complexity with hubble type , with galaxy luminosity , or with hi deficiency .",
    "_ hubble types are fairly equally distributed among galaxies with regular and disturbed rotation forms , ( fig 9 , except sb ) .",
    "both samples contain mostly sc s , and equivalent numbers of s0@xmath3sa .",
    "luminosities are also similar among both samples .",
    "the median apparent magnitudes , b@xmath27=11.90 ( disturbed ) and b@xmath27=11.93 ( regular ) , are similar , and correspond to m@xmath28=@xmath319.1 at the adopted distance .",
    "there is no strong correlation of hi deficiency parameter ( giovanelli & haynes 1985 ) with rotation curve forms ( fig .",
    "a comparison of this parameter for regular and disturbed rotation galaxies clearly shows that disturbed galaxies are not preferentially hi - deficient .",
    "this indicates that the mechanism which causes hi deficiency , presumably icm - ism interactions , is different from the mechanism which causes kinematic disturbances , presumably tidal interactions .",
    "in contrast , there is a small ( and marginally significant ) excess of disturbed rotation galaxies with normal hi emission ( i.e. , low hi deficiency ) .",
    "this small excess might arise if is easier to measure disturbed gas kinematics in galaxies with extended gas disks ( see 5 . below ) .",
    "_ there is no clear correlation of rotation curve classification with local galaxy density _ , as tabulated by tully ( 1988 ) .",
    "there are both regular ( n4647 and 4808 ) and disturbed ( n4536 ) galaxies in the regions of lowest ( 0.21 - 0.46 gal / mpc@xmath29 ) local density , as well as both regular ( n4456 ) and disturbed ( n4477 ) galaxies in regions of the highest local density ( 4.06 gal / mpc@xmath29 ) .",
    "ngc 4647 is a good illustration of the difficulties of sorting out local density and rotation curve form . with a regular rotation curve which shows little or no sign of an interaction , in a region called low density",
    ", it has a close companion on the sky , ngc 4649 ( s0 , which we have not observed ) .",
    "but the tully density parameter is not especially sensitive to pairs .",
    "furthermore , the high relative velocities in many galaxy - galaxy interactions makes it likely that any external culprit responsible has long since moved away or merged , so that present local density is only weakly related to earlier density when the interaction occurred .",
    "an examination of the vcc suggests that low velocity interactions within gravitationally bound pairs or groups is not the major cause of the kinematic disturbances .",
    "of the 11 sample galaxies which are likely to be in bound pairs ( e.g. , companions within 10@xmath14 = 46 kpc at the adopted distance , velocity differences of less than 300 km @xmath4 , and apparent brightness differences of less than 3 magnitudes ) , 4 are classified as disturbed , 7 as regular .",
    "these disturbed galaxies in pairs likely owe their disturbances to low - velocity tidal interactions with their companions . while there are undoubtedly more physically bound pairs and groups in virgo than these 11 ( ferguson 1992 ) , relaxing the identification criteria reduces the probability of finding true bound systems .",
    "a comparison of the nearest neighbors on the sky and in velocity shows no significant difference in the probability of belonging to a group or similar - mass pair for the disturbed and regular galaxies .",
    "this suggests that low velocity galaxy - galaxy interactions are not the only cause of kinematic distortions .",
    "high velocity tidal interactions ( moore et al . 1997 ) or galaxy - cluster interactions ( valluri 1993 ) are probably responsible for a significant fraction of the disturbances .",
    "the distribution of galaxy systemic velocities is different for galaxies with regular rotation curves and galaxies with disturbed rotation curves_. we show in fig .",
    "14 the distribution of heliocentric radial velocities for each class ( table 4 ) .",
    "while galaxies with regular rotation forms have a relatively flat distribution of observed velocities ranging from @xmath3300 km s@xmath4 to + 2600 km s@xmath4 , galaxies with disturbed rotation curves have a nearly gaussian velocity distribution which peaks near the cluster mean velocity . a maximum likelihood fit ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) gives @xmath30v@xmath31 = 1172@xmath5100 km s@xmath4 , and @xmath32 = 654@xmath571 km s@xmath4 .",
    "these two different distributions are reminiscent of the distributions which result when galaxies in virgo are sorted by hubble type and systemic velocity ( huchra 1985 , bst 1987 ) .",
    "early type galaxies show a gaussian distribution peaked at the cluster velocity ( @xmath30v@xmath31 = 1200@xmath546 km s@xmath4 ; @xmath32 = 581 ( + 35/-30 ) km s@xmath4 ; n=164 ; huchra 1985 ) .",
    "in contrast , late type galaxies have a flatter velocity distribution ( @xmath30v@xmath31 = 1144@xmath564 km s@xmath4 ) and consequently higher velocity dispersion ( @xmath32 = 871 ( + 49/-42 ) km s@xmath4 ; n=163 ; huchra 1985 ) . in fig .",
    "15 we superpose the spirals with disturbed kinematics on the distribution of ellipticals in virgo ( huchra 1985 ) ; the agreement is remarkable .    while the velocity distribution of the disturbed spirals matches that of the virgo ellipticals , their spatial distributions are quite different , with the ellipticals @xmath030 - 50% more centrally concentrated than the disturbed spirals .",
    "our new results on the velocity distributions offer additional evidence that galaxies with disturbed kinematics have orbits with large radial ( within the cluster ) components . in fig .",
    "16 , the fraction of galaxies with observed velocities farthest from the cluster mean ( smallest squares ) is highest within 3@xmath9 of m87 ; here radial orbital motions are aligned close to our l - o - s . with increasing distance from m87 ,",
    "radial orbits make larger angles with the l - o - s , so observed velocities are closer to the cluster mean velocity . the dispersion about the mean cluster velocity ( adopted as 1100 km / s ) decreases from 675 km s@xmath4 for disturbed galaxies observed within 1@xmath332.9@xmath9 of m87 to 256 km s@xmath4 for disturbed galaxies observed within 5@xmath336.9@xmath9 of m87 .",
    "orbits with large radial components will bring galaxies close to the cluster center , where tidal interactions with the cluster and other galaxies are strong and/or more common .",
    "the undisturbed spirals exhibit a significantly less pronounced effect , suggesting that their observed velocity distribution arises from orbits with relatively smaller radial components .",
    "regardless of the orbital intricacies which produce the observations , we have been able to identify two populations of virgo spirals by the characteristics of their rotation patterns .",
    "spirals in the disturbed population have recently ( @xmath111 gyr ) undergone a close encounter with another galaxy or with the cluster tidal field , with consequent kinematic disturbance .",
    "in contrast , the spiral population with normal rotation properties may have suffered no major encounters within the past @xmath810@xmath1 years .",
    "one interesting result of this division of spirals is that five of the six spirals in the sample with negative heliocentric systemic velocities have rotation forms classified regular .",
    "this is not evidence that they are foreground objects , but rather that they have not had a recent tidal interaction .",
    "_ spirals with disturbed rotation curves are not located preferentially close to m87 _",
    "16 ) . as the distance from m87 increases from 1@xmath9 to 7@xmath9 , in steps of 2@xmath9 , the fraction of galaxies with disturbed kinematics , relative to regular , increases from 0.38 to 0.54 to 0.88 .",
    "if we include the sa galaxies without emission in the disturbed category , the fractions change only to 0.44 , 0.54 , and 0.88 .",
    "although the numbers are small , the relative increase in disturbed forms , @xmath34m87@xmath35 , seems fairly secure .",
    "this observation follows as a natural consequence of radial orbits ( see 4 . above ) .",
    "galaxies on radial orbits spend most of their time near apocenter .",
    "hence we expect to find disturbed galaxies far from the cluster core , even though the disturbances occur closer to the cluster core .",
    "we have attempted to examine if there is a bias in our rotation curve classification .",
    "the few spirals near the inner core would have truncated gas disks .",
    "are we more likely to classify an extended rotation curve as disturbed than we are to classify a truncated curve as disturbed ?",
    "of the 16 galaxies within 2@xmath9 of m87 , 8 are classified regular , 7 as disturbed , and one unclassified . the range of measured gas extents , r@xmath21/r@xmath22 , are essentially the same for both types .",
    "of 4 s0s with small inner gas disks , 3 are classified regular . among the galaxies with very extended gas disks ,",
    "r@xmath21/r@xmath36 0.75 , 6 are classified regular , 11 disturbed .",
    "we conclude that any bias in the classification is small , and that the increasing fraction of disturbed galaxies at the core periphery is real .",
    "vmax , the maximum amplitude of rotation in the plane of the galaxy , is an important parameter for obtaining estimates of absolute magnitudes and distance estimates via the tully - fisher relation ( yasuda , fukugita , & okamura 1997 ; federspiel , tammann , & sandage 1998 ) .",
    "we list in the final column of table 1 , values of vmax we have determined .",
    "each value comes from the maximum of the rotation curve , or for galaxies with less extended emission , from extrapolating velocities to the r@xmath22 isophotal radius ( fig .",
    "12 ) .    in evaluating vmax ,",
    "we have been guided by the forms of the synthetic rotation curves ( src ) .",
    "these curves were produced some years ago ( thonnard & rubin 1981 ; rubin et al .",
    "1985 ) from our rotation curves of normal ( mostly ) field spirals , with systemic velocities ranging from about 1000 km s@xmath4 to 8000 km s@xmath4 , well distributed over the sky .",
    "rotation curves for galaxies of hubble type sa ( 11 ) , or sb ( 23 ) , or sc ( 20 ) were used to produce for that hubble type a sequence of src as a function of absolute magnitude . to determine absolute magnitudes ,",
    "each galaxy was placed at the distance inferred from its velocity , for an adopted hubble constant .",
    "note however , that in making use of the src here , we use only their forms ; the absolute magnitude scale is not relevant to the discussion .    to review the procedure to form the src , we show in fig .",
    "17 plots from the 1980 carnegie yearbook ( thonnard & rubin 1981 ) . the upper panels show the variation of rotational velocity with absolute magnitude for 20 sc galaxies , each plot for a different value of r / r@xmath22 .",
    "each fitted line is a tf - like relation , but evaluated at a fixed fraction of the galaxy radius , smaller than the r@xmath22 radius .",
    "the bottom plot shows the superposition of 5 such fits . to form the src for b@xmath37 = @xmath319 ( for example )",
    ", the velocity at successive values of 0.1 in r / r@xmath22 is read from the intersections , and a smooth curve drawn .",
    "this process is repeated for successive values of b@xmath37 .",
    "we have no doubt that this is a valid and valuable procedure .",
    "but we must point out that the ( mostly ) field sample of 60 contained 3 virgo cluster galaxies , and these three , ngc 4321 ( sc ) , 4419 ( sa ) , and 4698 ( sa ) , all classified regular , are in the present sample . as described in those early papers ,",
    "these three galaxies were placed at the mean virgo distance .",
    "we identify the points for ngc 4321 in fig .",
    "a check on the validity of this procedure comes from a comparison ( fig .",
    "18 ) of our vmax(optical ) values with vmax(21-cm ) ( federspiel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these authors correct published values of w@xmath38 for inclination , turbulent- and z - motions .",
    "our optical values include only inclination corrections and extrapolations discussed above ; our adopted inclinations differ only trivially from those of federspiel et al .",
    "the agreement of the two sets is excellent ; the perpendicular displacement of the points from the line of slope 1 gives @xmath13(log line width ) = 0.037 .    compared with the 21-cm line width ,",
    "galaxies with disturbed rotation curves show no larger scatter than galaxies with regular rotation curves .",
    "this is evidence that the 21-cm line width and the extrapolated optical rotation velocity measure the same quantity , and the quality of the optical vmax values are not compromised by irregularities in the rotation curves .",
    "the points which lie above the line ( fig .",
    "18 ) have optical velocities ( times 2 ) higher than the 21-cm profile widths .",
    "the few points which lie highest above the line have observed values of hi deficiency @xmath150.5 .",
    "the optical extrapolation procedure may compensate for the hi truncation , and offer an accurate value of the disk vmax .    while it is not the aim of this paper to present a tully - fisher analysis nor to determine a distance for the virgo cluster",
    ", we show several tf plots ( fig .",
    "19 ) . plots ( a ) and ( c ) show the correlation of blue apparent magnitude with log vmax ; galaxies are identified by their rotation classification .",
    "galaxies with uncertain values of vmax are excluded .",
    "galaxies both regular and disturbed are well mixed , and exhibit similar scatter .",
    "when the galaxies are coded by hubble type , ( fig .",
    "19b ) , the characteristic separation of early types toward higher rotation velocity is apparent . when hubble types s0@xmath3sb are excluded ( fig .",
    "19c ) , the scatter is reduced .",
    "although hubble type dependence disappears for h magnitudes , there are only 18 virgo galaxies in our sample ( fig .",
    "19d ) with h magnitudes ( aaronson et al . 1982 ) .    a few virgo galaxies have exceptionally small rotation velocities .",
    "notable are ngc 4064 , 4424 , 4506 , 4584 , 4694 ; all have emission detected only over a small fraction ( @xmath39 ) of their radii , with velocities close to zero . their location on tully - fisher plots ( figs .",
    "17 , 19 ) shows that their optical velocities are anomalously low for their optical luminosities , if the l - o - s velocities arise from circular orbits in a circular disk , and if the galaxies are at the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "while we have no direct measures of their distances , their small gas extents and peculiar morphologies suggest that they are indeed in the cluster .",
    "they are difficult to classify .",
    "several are called amorphous or pec , a few are barred , several have no obvious nucleus .",
    "n4424 is an apparent merger remnant ( kenney et al .",
    "perhaps they are en route to becoming spheroidals . a few others , ugc 7171 , 7249 , and 7784 , with low vmax but with more normally extended gas , define the low - luminosity end of the tully - fisher plot ( fig .",
    "we may have detected galaxies in which the gas is not rotationally supported .",
    "such galaxies have been produced in n - body cluster simulations ( moore , katz , & lake 1995 ) .",
    "following several strong encounters , the galaxy loses angular momentum , and ends up as a prolate figure with gas at the center . hence rotation along the most elongated axis",
    "may be small ; rotation along the apparent minor axis can be larger .",
    "both ngc 4064 and 4424 ( kenney et al . 1996 ) show approximately zero velocities along their major axes , and small but velocity gradients along their minor axes ; we have no minor axis spectra for the others in this set .",
    "such galaxies deserve more study .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to present optical kinematic information for a significant number of galaxies in the virgo cluster , and to identify kinematic disturbances in these galaxies .",
    "we present evidence that there are two populations of spirals in the cluster , distinguished by their internal kinematics .",
    "those with regular rotation properties exhibit a distribution of systemic velocities which is flat , v@xmath2 = @xmath3300 km s@xmath4 to v@xmath2 = + 2500 km s@xmath4 .",
    "those with disturbed rotation exhibit a gaussian distribution of systemic velocities which peaks near the cluster systemic velocity , v@xmath2 = + 1172@xmath5100 km s@xmath4 and @xmath32 = 654@xmath571 km s@xmath4 ( fig .",
    "disturbed galaxies are not preferentially near m87 , but are prominent near the 6@xmath9 core periphery .",
    "the disturbed galaxies probably have orbits with larger radial ( relative to the cluster center ) components than the undisturbed galaxies , and some of them may be falling into the core for the first time .",
    "identifying this population of spirals with disturbed kinematics is the major result of this study .",
    "other conclusions which follow have been discussed in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "we can not distinguish between galaxy - galaxy or galaxy - cluster gravitational interactions as the sources which produced these disturbances , although the required perturbations should not be bisymmetric , in order to match the observations .",
    "perhaps there are multiple causes . in any cluster",
    ", galaxies will be exposed to both local ( galaxy - galaxy ) and global ( galaxy - cluster ) interactions .",
    "the effects may be more pronounced in a non - virialized cluster like virgo , where tidal effects from substructure are likely important , and where infalling galaxies will experience these effects for the first time .",
    "regardless of the cause , the processes which produce disturbed rotation curves must also play a role in altering the galaxies morphologies , and perhaps also in driving the virgo cluster toward dynamical equilibrium . in their systemic velocity distribution , the galaxies with disturbed kinematics resemble the nearly - virialized elliptical population more than they resemble the non - virialized population of spirals with regular kinematics .",
    "ellipticals and the disturbed spirals have similar distributions of l - o - s orbital velocities , yet the disturbed spirals are on average located further from the cluster center .",
    "this raises an interesting question about galaxy morphology and environment .",
    "do elliptical galaxies owe their morphology to their orbits within the cluster ?",
    "galaxies we identify as kinematically disturbed are only that subset presently within the required time window following the event .",
    "interacting galaxies observed at earlier or later interaction stages will have more modest kinematic distortions .",
    "this may explain the lack of simple correlation between galaxies with kinematic disturbances and apparent pairs , and why other galaxies which may indeed be experiencing tidal interactions display only minimal kinematic irregularities .",
    "thirty years ago , peebles ( 1970 ; see also lynden - bell 1967 ) made a 300-body calculation , matched to velocity and position parameters of galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "the results confirmed that a gravitationally bound cluster could collapse in an expanding universe , an idea that was then not yet universally accepted .",
    "shectman ( 1982 ) extended the calculation to study a more detailed infall model for the formation of the coma cluster .",
    "his conclusion , that a similar calculation  ... should be possible for the virgo cluster \" is now almost 20 years old .",
    "perhaps its time will soon come .    with the availability of larger telescopes",
    ", observational interests are moving from nearby to very distant clusters .",
    "data from the virgo cluster should offer a baseline for study of distant clusters , as we attempt to learn when and how galaxies and clusters formed .",
    "but the data have relevance to other questions . they are input for the tully - fisher correlation and for our infall to virgo .",
    "they aid in understanding the role that interactions play in the formation and evolution of galaxies within a cluster and for the cluster as a whole , and in learning how evolutionary processes differ for field and cluster spirals .",
    "unfortunately , we lack data concerning _ stellar _ orbits within most galaxies .",
    "stellar kinematics can provide valuable evidence for disturbances in gas - poor galaxies , for mergers and accretion events , and also answer questions concerning the similarity of stellar and gas motions .",
