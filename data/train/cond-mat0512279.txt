    "recently , there have been extensive studies of the physics of the spin - orbit ( so ) interaction in condensed matter . the most intriguing phenomenon induced by",
    "so coupling is the spin - hall effect ( she ) : when a dc electric field is applied , the so interaction may result in a net nonvanishing spin current flow along the transverse direction .",
    "the she is classified into two types according to its origin , an _",
    "extrinsic _ spin - orbit hamiltonian term induced by carrier - impurity scattering potentials@xcite and an _ intrinsic _ spin - orbit hamiltonian term arising from free carrier kinetics.@xcite the intrinsic spin - hall effect was originally thought to be independent of carrier - impurity scattering .",
    "experimentally , the she was observed in a @xmath1-type bulk semiconductor@xcite and in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) heavy - hole system.@xcite    however , further studies have indicated that the spin - hall effect associated with the intrinsic mechanism can be strongly affected by carrier - impurity scattering ( disorder).@xcite ( to avoid confusion , we use the term `` intrinsic she '' to refer to the total spin - hall effect arising from the so coupling terms of the hamiltonian that do not explicitly involve scattering ; ultimately , this is corrected by scattering , but the part that is unaffected by scattering will be termed the intrinsic `` disorder - independent '' she . ) in diffusive 2d semiconductors , there always exists a contribution to the intrinsic spin - hall current which arises from spin - conserving electron - impurity scattering , but it is independent of impurity density within the diffusive regime . for 2d",
    "_ electron _ systems with rashba so coupling , this disorder - related spin - hall current leads to the vanishing of the total intrinsic spin - hall current , irrespective of the specific form of the scattering potential , of the collisional broadening , and of temperature.@xcite in 2d rashba _ heavy - hole _",
    "systems , disorder affects the intrinsic she in a different fashion : contributions from short - range collisions to the she vanish,@xcite while long - range electron - impurity scattering produces a nonvanishing disorder - related spin - hall current , whose sign changes with variation of the hole density.@xcite    to date , the effect of disorder on the intrinsic spin - hall current in @xmath0-type bulk semiconductors has been studied relatively little . employing a kubo formula ,",
    "murakami found a null disorder effect on the intrinsic she for short - range hole - impurity collisions.@xcite the crossover of the she from the diffusive to the hopping regime has been investigated by modeling finite - size samples ( with a maximum of @xmath2 lattice sites ) by chen , _",
    "et al_.@xcite in this paper , we employ a nonequilibrium green s function approach to study the effect of more realistic _ long - range _ hole - impurity scattering on the intrinsic spin - hall current in a diffusive @xmath0-type bulk semiconductor .",
    "we find that , in such a system , the contribution of hole - impurity collisions to the intrinsic spin - hall current is finite and it is independent of impurity density within the diffusive regime .",
    "moreover , this disorder contribution has its sign opposite to that of the disorder - independent one , leading to a sign change of the total spin - hall current as the hole density varies .",
    "furthermore , we make clear that the disorder - independent spin - hall effect arises from an interband polarization process directly induced by the dc electric field and it involves all hole states below the fermi surface . in contrast to this , the disorder contribution to the intrinsic she originates from a disorder - mediated polarization between two hole bands and is associated only with hole states in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",

    ", we find that , in the studied regime of hole density , the effect of collisional broadening on the disorder - independent spin - hall current is less than 1% for @xmath0-type bulk gaas semiconductors with mobility approximately larger than 5m@xmath218/vs . thus , in such systems , the effect of collisional broadening on the total spin - hall conductivity can be ignored .",
    "it should be noted that in our calculations , we computed @xmath235 by considering short - range hole - impurity scattering : @xmath236 with the densities of hole states in the light- and heavy - hole bands taken as @xmath237 .",
    "the quantity @xmath238 is determined from the mobility of the system : @xmath239/n_p$ ] , where @xmath240 and @xmath241 are the effective masses of holes and @xmath242^{3/2}$ ] with @xmath243 and @xmath244 being the hole densities in the light- and heavy - hole bands , respectively .    on the other hand , in our considerations , the impurities are taken to be so dense that we can use a statistical average over the impurity configuration .",
    "this requires that @xmath245 ( @xmath246 is the characteristic size of the sample and @xmath247 is the larger of the diffusion lengths of holes in the light- and heavy - hole bands ) . failing this",
    ", the behavior of the holes would become ballistic , with transport properties depending on the specific impurity configuration .",
    "we have employed a nonequilibrium green s function kinetic equation approach to investigate disorder effects on the spin - hall current in the diffusive regime in @xmath0-type bulk luttinger semiconductors .",
    "long - range hole - impurity scattering has been considered within the framework of the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "we have found that , in contrast to the null effect of short - range disorder on the spin - hall current , long - range scattering produces a nonvanishing contribution to the spin - hall current , independent of impurity density in the diffusive regime .",
    "this contribution has its sign opposite to that of the disorder - independent one , leading to a sign change of the total spin - hall current as the hole density varies .",
    "we also made clear that the disorder - independent spin - hall effect arises from a dc - field - induced polarization associated with all hole states in the fermi sea , while the disorder - related one is produced by a disorder - mediated polarization and relates to only those hole states in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "the numerical calculation indicates that with increasing hole density , the total spin - hall mobility monotonically decreases , whereas the spin - hall conductivity first increases and then falls .",
    "in addition to @xmath39 , we also examined other components of the spin current .",
    "we found that the previously discovered `` basic spintronics relation'',@xcite which relates the @xmath248th component of the spin current along the direction @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and the applied electric field , @xmath251 , by @xmath252 with @xmath253 as a totally antisymmetric tensor , still holds in the presence of spin - conserving hole - impurity scattering .",
