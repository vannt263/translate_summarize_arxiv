    "the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite , @xmath1 is a theoretical model derived from the minimal coupling @xcite between a neutral two - level atom , described by frequency transition @xmath2 and pauli matrices @xmath3 , and a quantized cavity field mode , described by the frequency @xmath4 and the creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , related to the one - atom maser of cavity - quantum - electrodynamics ( cavity - qed ) @xcite ; it can also describe the dynamics of a trapped two - level ion in trapped - ion - qed @xcite and the coupling of a superconducting qubit interacting with a microwave resonator in circuit - qed @xcite .",
    "the buck - sukumar model ( bsm ) @xcite , where the coupling between a two - level system and a quantized field depends on the intensity of the field , @xmath7 is a clever modification of the jcm that leads to a closed form analytic solution .",
    "its physical realization in the quantum optics laboratory may not be feasible , as it requires a trapped - ion setup driven by a large superposition of field modes @xcite , but it may be classically simulated in arrays of coupled waveguides @xcite . despite its purely theoretical origin ,",
    "the bsm @xcite and its generalization for qubit ensembles @xcite have provided analytically tractable models showing periodic decay and revival in the atomic excitation energy @xcite , mean photon number @xcite , and field squeezing parameters @xcite that has attracted the attention of the quantum optics community .",
    "it is also well known that the field in the bsm can be described by a @xmath8 algebra @xcite and that it is possible to interpolate between the jcm and the bsm by choosing a particular q - deformed algebra for the field @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the so - called counter - rotating terms obviated by the rotating wave approximation into the bsm , @xmath9 reduces the parameter range where the model is well defined to @xmath10 due to the underlying @xmath8 symmetry @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in an intensity - dependent quantum rabi hamiltonian that is the simplest generalization of the bsm model without the rwa , @xmath11 where a bargmann parameter value of @xmath0 returns the bsm plus counter rotating terms . in quantum electrodynamics",
    "this model may be just a theoretical curiosity , but it is of interest in the field of classical optics where it may be possible to classically simulate it with light propagating through a semi - infinite array of coupled waveguides @xcite . in the following",
    "we will show that this model can be fully written in terms of a su(1,1 ) algebra due to parity conservation , that it is possible to provide a perturbation theory solution for it in the regime where the qubit transition is negligible , @xmath12 , that a supersymmetric partner can be given for it in this regime and that both the model and its isospectral partner may be classical simulated by a semi - infinite array of coupled waveguides .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq . ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) conserves parity , @xmath13 = 0 $ ] with @xmath14 .",
    "this allows us to define two parity subspaces , @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to the field in the vacuum state and the qubit in the ground or excited level , in that order .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) becomes the hamiltonians @xmath21 in each parity subspace after defining @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that they form the su(1,1 ) group , @xmath25= - 2 \\hat{k}_{0}$ ] and @xmath26= \\pm \\hat{k}_{\\pm}$ ] @xcite .",
    "in such a case we can put aside the constant terms and focus on the parity subspace hamiltonians , @xmath27 while in qed it may not make sense , in photonic lattices it is useful to define two regimes where the model is soluble using the qubit frequency as reference : ( i ) a weak coupling regime where the coupling constant is negligible compared to the qubit frequency , @xmath28 , where in the case @xmath29 the eigenstates of the model are the parity states @xmath30 with energy @xmath31 and ( ii ) a deep - strong coupling regime where the qubit frequency is negligible compared to the coupling constant , @xmath32 , where in the case @xmath33 the eigenstates are su(1,1 ) generalized coherent states , @xmath34 , with energy @xmath35 .",
    "the unitary displacement is given by @xmath36 @xcite with @xmath37 for our case ; note that the displacement parameter , @xmath38 , restricts the coupling values for this regime to @xmath10 . at this point",
    ", we can follow an argument identical to that found in @xcite and find that despite that the modified evolution operator @xmath39 is apparently unitary , the value of @xmath40 diverges at any finite time for @xmath41 and , thus , the model seems to be valid just for values of @xmath42 .    in",
    "any given set of frequencies and coupling parameters , e.g. @xmath43\\right\\}$ ] , the model in the parity bases becomes a tridiagonal , real , symmetric semi - infinite matrix which eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be approximated by standard linear algebra methods or discussed analytically following standard methods @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows numerically calculated spectra in the positive and negative parity subspaces for the model hamiltonian @xmath44 as a function of the qubit frequency .",
    "the equidistant behavior predicted for the extremes of the weak- and deep - strong - coupling regimes can already be observed .",
    "the spectra shows avoided crossings between the energies of a given parity and crossings between energies of different parity in a similar manner to the spectra of the quantum rabi hamiltonian where integrability has been argued on this basis @xcite .     with @xmath0 , that is the bsm plus counter - rotating terms , for variable qubit frequency @xmath2 with a fixed coupling parameter ( a)@xmath45 and ( b)@xmath46 .",
    "the insets show typical avoided crossings . ]",
    "let us consider the limiting case of the deep - strong coupling regime where @xmath47 , again this may not make sense while thinking of cavity- , trapped - ion- or circuit-@xmath48 but such a model can be produced in photonic lattices @xcite , and define the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath49 if we define a qubit - field annihilation ( creation ) operator as @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) with parameter @xmath52 where the restriction @xmath10 appears once more , we can write two unbroken supersymmetric partners , @xmath53 where the tilded operators are a different representation of su(1,1 ) : @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . note that both partners are covered by the initial hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , for a degenerate qubit because @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the two susy partners are diagonalized by the displacement @xmath59 defined before and reduce to the following form , @xmath60 where it is possible to realize that their spectra are identical , @xmath61 .",
    "a particular case of such unbroken supersymmetric partners has been previously discussed for the parameter set : @xmath0 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath65 in the context of photonic isospectral lattices @xcite .",
    "the optical simulation of quantum rabi model in arrays of coupled waveguides inscribed by laser damage in fused silica has been proposed and demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "nonlinear quantum rabi models are also feasible of optical simulation @xcite if care is exerted on the validity of the hamiltonians and the characteristics of the required lattices @xcite . to produce the lattice we follow a standard procedure , which in our case means inserting the general state @xmath66 and the hamiltonian @xmath67 into schrdinger equation , to obtain the differential equation sets @xmath68 these sets are equivalent up to a phase with those describing a tight binding photonic lattice where the effective refractive index of the @xmath69th waveguide is given by @xmath70 , up to a constant bias refractive index shared by all waveguides , and the coupling between neighbor @xmath69th and @xmath71th waveguides is given by @xmath72 , with the bargmann parameter @xmath73 and the restriction @xmath42 as discussed before .",
    "the generalities of the optical simulation of quantum phenomena can be found in reviews on the topic @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that while the theoretical quantum - optical model requires a semi - infinite array of coupled waveguides , it is possible to cut off the size of the array depending on the initial state to propagate .",
    "this cut off also helps in keeping the photonic lattice experimentally feasible as stronger coupling parameter values require closer waveguides that may prove a complication in the laboratory and produce coupling between second or higher - order neighbors .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the initial state @xmath74 under the dynamics imposed by @xmath75 as a classical simulation provided by light impinging the zeroth waveguide of a photonic lattice with the parameter set @xmath76 and a lattice size of two hundred waveguides .",
    "quasi - periodical @xmath77 returns to a state close to the initial state can be observed in the intensity of the zeroth waveguide , @xmath78 , mean photon number , @xmath79 which is equivalent to the barycenter of the intensity , and mean atomic excitation energy , @xmath80 $ ] which is equivalent to the difference between the total intensity at odd and even waveguides .",
    "this is an interesting phenomenon that we were not expecting in the model for such a high coupling parameter and should be probed in the future .     with an initial state @xmath81 and parameter set @xmath82 .",
    "( a)intensity at the zeroth waveguide , ( b ) mean photon number equivalent to the intensity barycenter , ( c ) mean atomic excitation energy equivalent to the total intensity in odd waveguides minus the total intensity in even waveguides . ]",
    "we have proposed an intensity - dependent quantum rabi model with an underlying parity and su(1,1 ) symmetry . in the case",
    "@xmath0 our model reduces to the buck - sukumar model plus counter - rotating terms . as expected from the behaviour of the buck - sukumar model , our model seems to be invalid for coupling factors of @xmath83 .",
    "the behavior of the spectra is similar to the quantum rabi model ; that is , avoided crossings in spectral branches belonging to the same parity and crossings between spectral branches belonging to different parities . in the special case of degenerate qubit frequency , @xmath84 , it is straightforward to diagonalize the model with generalized su(1,1 ) coherent states .",
    "it is also possible to provide qubit - field creation and annihilation operators that fulfill the commutator for the field and allows us to construct an unbroken susy partner for it ; the susy partners correspond to bargmann parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this gives a recipe to a class of isospectral photonic lattices .",
    "finally , we discussed the classical simulation of the full theoretical model in finite arrays of coupled photonic waveguides and showed by numerical simulation that it is possible to find quasi - periodic reconstruction for a given initial state in the full intensity - dependent quantum rabi model for a given parameter set ."
