    "ohm s law can be written as @xmath0 , showing the simple linear relation between the applied electric field @xmath1 and the current density @xmath2 .",
    "the electrical resistivity @xmath3 comprises a wealth of information on the material and its careful measurement over the last century in solid - state physics has introduced new intriguing phenomena , like high - temperature superconductivity@xcite and the integer@xcite and fractional@xcite quantum hall effect . for the case of spin currents in two - component cold - atom systems with pseudo - spin _ up _ and _ down _ a similar relation applies@xcite : @xmath4 where the applied force @xmath5 on particles with spin _ up _ , mass @xmath6 and density @xmath7 leads to a drift velocity difference @xmath8 between the two spin species .",
    "this results in a spin - current density @xmath9 , which is inversely proportional to the spin resistivity @xmath10 . because of the absence of impurities and an ionic lattice the spin resistivity @xmath11 is for ultra - cold atoms completely determined by the spin - drag rate @xmath12 .",
    "this rate is a measure for the transfer of momentum via interactions between the two spin species .",
    "the similarity between ohm s law and eq .",
    "( [ eq : equdrag ] ) can be understood from the analogy between their underlying physical mechanism . in both cases",
    "the external force or field leads to an acceleration , which on average is interrupted after a time @xmath13 and this leads to a finite current . for spin currents in ultra - cold atoms the particles with one spin collide with particles of another spin and these collisions",
    "do not conserve the spin current , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : schematics]a .",
    "this is the microscopic origin of spin drag .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in electronic systems spin - drag effects also exist , but are usually small compared to the effects of impurities and phonons  @xcite , whereas for ultra - cold atoms they are the only effect and therefore dominant .    to observe spin drag in",
    "trapped ultra - cold atomic quantum gases , we set atoms with pseudo - spin _ up _ into motion with respect to atoms with pseudo - spin _ down _ and observe , how atoms with spin _ down _ are dragged along with the atoms with spin _",
    "up_. in our first method , the _ constant force _  method , we apply a constant force @xmath5 on only the spin species _ up _ as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : schematics]b . after a short period",
    "a constant drift velocity difference @xmath8 has developed between the two spin species , where the ratio of the applied force @xmath5 and @xmath8 is proportional to the drag rate @xmath12 .",
    "this method is well suited for a large drag rates , but for weak drag a steady state may not be achieved before the two clouds are spatially separated .",
    "therefore for small drag rates we apply our second method , the _ oscillation _  method . in this method",
    "the centers of the two spin species are first separated from each other and then start to oscillate in the trap .",
    "the decay time of the relative oscillation is proportional to the drag rate .",
    "for both methods we have to detect the change in relative position of the clouds as a function of time .",
    "we apply a stern - gerlach technique@xcite in a direction perpendicular to the applied force to spatially separate the spin species and image the clouds with absorption imaging .    in the experiment we load up to @xmath14 @xmath15na atoms into a cigar - shaped optical far - off - resonant trap ( fort ) with trap frequencies of @xmath16 = 835 hz in the radial and @xmath17 = 3.5 hz in the axial direction .",
    "the trap is tight in the radial direction to obtain a large density , thereby producing a collisionally opaque and hydrodynamic sample in the axial direction .",
    "the temperature is between 28 @xmath18k and is always kept above the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the atoms in the trap are initially all in one spin state . for stability and",
    "to maximize the interspecies collisions we then flip about 50% of the atoms to another spin state , creating an equal mixture of spin species _ up _ and _ down _ ( see methods ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : snapshot ] we show an example of the _ constant force _  method .",
    "the force is applied on the spin species _ up _ such that this cloud starts to move to the left and due to spin drag the spin species _ down _ is dragged along .",
    "careful observation shows that the upper cloud of spin species _ up _ is skewed : the left wing of the cloud is longer than the right wing .",
    "this is a first , direct indication of spin drag , which is shown more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fg : snapshot]b in the profiles along the pulling direction through the center of each cloud .",

    "[ fg : snapshot]b , the difference in position between the two clouds is much smaller than the width of the clouds such that local effects can be neglected .    to obtain the spin - drag rate this measurement is repeated for different magnitudes of the force and different durations during which the force is applied . in all cases we measure the relative displacement as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : snapshot]b .",
    "the result for different duration @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : fitcurve ] . after a short time",
    "the difference in position between the two clouds is linear in time , indicating that there is a constant drift velocity @xmath20 between the two spin species .",
    "this is direct evidence for spin drag as the drag leads to friction between the two spin states . in the absence of drag the difference in position",
    "would show a quadratic dependence on time due to the ballistic motion of the atoms .",
    "the curvature for short times ( @xmath21 5 ms ) in fig .",
    "[ fg : fitcurve ] is due to the fact that the two clouds are initially not in a steady state .",
    "however , the clouds are collisionally opaque , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are in the hydrodynamical regime , and the two clouds reach quickly a steady state . in our analysis",
    "we allow for this by solving the coupled equations of motion for the centers of the two clouds@xcite and the results are used to extract @xmath12 from the data .     between the position of the two clouds as a function of duration @xmath19 that the force is applied .",
    "the data points are indicated by the red dots and the blue line is a fit to the data using the solution of the coupled equations of motion of the two clouds . after a short period ( @xmath21 5 ms ) @xmath22 is linear in time , indicating that there is drag between the two clouds .",
    "all data points are offset due to an artefact in the stern - gerlach technique , which shifts after the spin drag the axial position of the two clouds with respect to each other by a constant amount .",
    "the inset shows the drift velocity @xmath20 as a function of the strength of the force @xmath23 .",
    "the straight line is a fit to the data , which shows that the experiments are in the linear - response regime for the drag , where eq .",
    "( [ eq : equdrag ] ) holds .",
    "[ fg : fitcurve ] ]    equation  [ eq : equdrag ] is only valid for small applied force @xmath24 , such that the response of the clouds is still in the linear regime .",
    "two of us@xcite showed that for ultra - cold atoms to be in the linear - response regime @xmath20 should be well below the thermal velocity @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath27 the temperature . in the experiments @xmath28 is of the order of 6 cm / s , whereas typical values for @xmath20 are of the order of 1 mm / s .",
    "thus we expect that our experiments are in the linear regime . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fg : fitcurve ] we have tested this assumption by measuring @xmath20 as a function of the acceleration @xmath29 . the line is a linear fit that shows good agreement with the data , which indicates that this measurement is indeed in the linear regime .",
    "since we conducted this measurement with the lowest number of particles and thus lowest drag rate , this proves that all our measurements for the _ constant force _  method are in the linear - response regime .    as mentioned , for lower drag rates we applied the _ oscillation",
    "_  method . here",

    "[ fg : betavspull ] we show the relative displacement between the two clouds as a function of time after releasing the atoms . since the drag rate @xmath12 is much larger than the axial trap frequency @xmath31 , the relative oscillation is overdamped and the decay rate is given by @xmath32 , which allows us to extract the spin - drag rate @xmath12 from the measurements . even for the lowest drag rates the oscillation remains overdamped .     in position between the two clouds for the _ oscillation _",
    "method as a function of time @xmath19 after the release of the atoms .",
    "the relative oscillation is overdamped , in which case the decay rate @xmath33 of the oscillation is given by @xmath34 with @xmath31 the oscillation frequency in the trap and @xmath12 the drag rate .",

    "all data points are offset due to an artefact in the stern - gerlach technique , which shifts after the oscillation the axial position of the two clouds with respect to each other by a constant amount .",
    "[ fg : betavspull ] ]    as explained earlier , spin drag is caused by collisions between atoms in different spin states .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that the drag rate @xmath12 should be proportional to the interspecies collision rate @xmath35 . for a non - degenerate gas stringari and pitaevskii@xcite",
    "find @xmath36 .",
    "the factor @xmath37 , independent of temperature , reflects the fact that for the drag not all collisions contribute equally because only the velocity component in the direction of the force is relevant . in fig .",
    "[ fg : betavsgam ] we plot our results for the drag rate as a function of the interspecies collision rate , which is given for the trap by @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the density of one spin species averaged over the trap , @xmath40 is the interspecies collisional cross section and @xmath41 the relative velocity between the two colliding atoms averaged over the velocity distribution . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : betavsgam ] , our results in the non - degenerate regime are in good agreement with the result of stringari and pitaevskii@xcite .     as a function of the interspecies collision rate @xmath35 . here",
    "the results for the _ constant force _  method are indicated with black dots and the results of the _ oscillation _  method are indicated by green dots .",
    "the red line represents the prediction of stringari and pitaevskii@xcite and in this range of @xmath35 agrees with our experiment results .",
    "[ fg : betavsgam ] ]    for larger phase - space densities the gas can no longer be considered as classical and quantum statistics becomes important . for our bose gas collisions are enhanced at low temperatures due to bose stimulation .",
    "this should be contrasted with fermionic systems , where the drag rate is suppressed at low temperatures due to pauli blocking@xcite .",
    "collisions are enhanced due to two effects .",
    "first , the central densities of the gas in a trap with a fixed number of particles and temperature increases due to bose enhancement beyond its classical value .",
    "second , the scattering process is enhanced due to bose stimulation to the final states . in this regime",
    "we no longer expect to find a temperature - independent proportionality factor between the drag rate and the interspecies collision rate .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "[ fg : universal ] the drag rate is shown as a function of the fugacity @xmath42 , where @xmath18 is the chemical potential of the gas .",
    "for @xmath43 the gas is in the classical limit , whereas for @xmath44 the gas starts to bose - einstein condense .",
    "van driel _",
    "et al._@xcite showed that the drag rate scaled as @xmath45 is a function of the fugacity @xmath46 only . in fig .",
    "[ fg : universal ] we plot @xmath45 as a function of the fugacity @xmath46 , where @xmath46 and @xmath27 are determined from the experiment ( see methods )",
    ". for a classical gas @xmath45 depends linearly on @xmath46 and the classical result is indicated in the figure with a straight line . for small @xmath46 our measurements agree with this result , but for larger values of @xmath46 the drag rate increases above the classical rate .",
    "evaluating the expression of van driel _",
    "et al._@xcite for the drag rate of an inhomogeneous sample , we find the bose enhancement of the drag rate , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fg : universal ] by the blue line . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "our results are in good agreement with theory . as a measure of the accuracy of the theory we use the reduced chi - squared parameter @xmath47 , which becomes unity for a large number of observations when the data agrees with the theory . for the classical result",
    "we obtain @xmath48 = 6.10 , whereas the calculations including bose enhancement yields @xmath48 = 1.58 .",
    "we emphasize that here @xmath48 is used to compare our experimental results to a theory without any adjustable parameters .     as a function of the fugacity @xmath49 .",
    "the dots represent the data points , whereas the curves show the results for the spin - drag rate using the classical results of stringari and pitaevskii@xcite ( red curve ) and the quantum results of van driel et al.@xcite ( blue curve ) . for small",
    "@xmath46 the gas behaves classically and the data agrees with both models . for large @xmath46",
    "( @xmath50 0.5 ) the data deviates from the classical model and is in agreement with the quantum model .",
    "the results show that the measurement of the spin - drag rate is a precursor for the phase transition of bose - einstein condensation at @xmath44 .",
    "[ fg : universal ] ]    it is important to realize that the experiments presented here can only be performed when the sample is in the hydrodynamic regime . in this case",
    "the number of collisions during one trap oscillation is much larger than one . to quantify this",
    "we can define a hydrodynamicity parameter@xcite @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the total collision rate including inter- and intraspecies collisions . for the current experiments we have reached @xmath52 = 1.4 khz at an axial trap frequency of @xmath53 = 3.5 hz , yielding a hydrodynamicity of @xmath54 60 .",
    "this large hydrodynamicity allows us to quickly reach a steady state .",
    "this can for instance be seen in fig .",
    "[ fg : fitcurve ] , where a steady state is reached after 5 ms corresponding to only a few collisions .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied spin drag and determined the spin - drag rate for a gas of ultra - cold bosonic atoms .",
    "we find that in the quantum regime spin drag is bose enhanced and up to almost a factor of two larger than the classical value , which is in good agreement with a recent theoretical prediction@xcite .",
    "this shows that the measurement of spin drag is a strong precursor of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "our results pave the way for studies of the transport properties of degenerate bosons which are very different from fermionic systems , such as electrons in ordinary conductors , and give a complementary picture of transport .",
    "our results are among the first that study transport properties of ultra - cold atoms and in the long term are important for the development of atomtronic devices that are based on transport of ultra - cold atoms@xcite .",
    "sodium atoms are trapped and cooled in the @xmath55 state ( pseudo - spin _ up _ ) in a magnetic trap , before transferred to a fort . in the fort",
    "a radio - frequency sweep is applied , such that half of the atoms are transferred to the state @xmath56 state ( pseudo - spin _ down _ ) .",
    "the atoms in the fort are tightly confined in the radial direction and the sample is hydrodynamic in the axial direction .",
    "the force on the atoms is applied using a magnetic field gradient , which only acts on the spin _ up _ atoms . after the experiment the two clouds",
    "are spatially separated using a radially inhomogeneous magnetic field and subsequently imaged using absorption imaging .",
    "the spin - drag rate is extracted by solving coupled equations for the position of the individual spin species and extracting the relative displacement @xmath22 from the solutions where the spin - drag rate is a free parameter .",
    "this solution can be compared to the experimental data to extract the spin - drag rate .",
    "the inter- and intraspecies collision rates are determined using the measured number of atoms in each cloud and the temperature .",
    "combined with the known scattering cross section @xmath57 and the trap frequencies in the radial and axial direction the inter- , intraspecies and total scattering rate can be determined .",
    "the samples were prepared in a magnetic trap by standard laser and evaporative cooling methods of sodium atoms in the @xmath55 state ( pseudo - spin _ up _ ) .",
    "there are two major improvements with respect to other experiments concerning the particle numbers : spin polarizing atoms before the transfer from the magneto - optical trap to the magnetic trap and decompressing the trap axially at the end of the evaporative cooling stage@xcite .",
    "the final trap frequencies are axially @xmath58 = 1.5 hz and radially @xmath16 = 116 hz with up to @xmath59 atoms .",
    "after evaporatively cooling the atoms to a few @xmath18k the fort is adiabatically turned on in 400 ms with a trap depth of about 50 @xmath18k , an axial trap frequency of @xmath58 = 3.5 hz and a radial trap frequency of @xmath16 = 835 hz , leading to @xmath60 atoms in the trap .",
    "the lifetime is more than 7 s. the atoms in the @xmath56 state ( pseudo - spin _ down _ ) are produced with a radio - frequency sweep from below the bottom of the magnetic trap : 2.6 mhz to 2.71 mhz in 30 to 50 ms .",
    "the fraction of atoms in the @xmath61 state is estimated to be less than 10% and the same for all measurements and does not influence the drag rate .",
    "the force on the spin species _ up _ is produced by a magnetic field gradient using anti - helmholtz coils with a constant offset magnetic field such that the zero crossing of the field is not in the area of interest .",
    "the detection of different spin species is achieved by turning on the radial magnetic confinement for 5 ms only and then ramping down the fort in 2 ms for radial cooling .",
    "the radial cooling is performed to assure spatial separation of the two spin species . after this time the spin species _ down _ falls freely due to gravitation while the spin species _ up _ is still radially trapped .",
    "an additional time of flight of 510 ms before imaging is used depending on the density and temperature of the clouds .",
    "the imaging is performed by sending a probe beam through the two clouds and detecting the absorption on a ccd camera .",
    "the axial position difference is determined by fitting the clouds with a gaussian distribution multiplied by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the error function , @xmath64 the central position in the gaussian distribution and @xmath57 a measure of skewness . from",
    "the fits the number of atoms of each species and the temperature are deduced .",
    "the latter is deduced from the length of the clouds when the force is applied for 1 ms only .",
    "each measurement is repeated three times for error reduction .",
    "temperature and total number of atoms are also measured separately by detecting a non - perturbed cloud expanding freely in 30 ms time of flight and fitted with a gaussian distribution . especially for large clouds",
    "this is necessary since the anharmonicity of the trap in the axial direction causes a systematic error in the temperature measurement .",
    "the differential equations describing the system are @xmath65 with @xmath66 the axial center - of - mass position of spin species _ up _ and _ down _ , respectively , @xmath67 , @xmath68 the atomic mass , @xmath69 the axial trapping potential and @xmath23 the applied force on the spin species _",

    "non - equal spin mixtures and neglects higher - order corrections .",

    "it can be shown by using similar equations for three spin states that the drag rate between two of these species as defined above is not influenced by the presence of a third species , if the three drag rates are the same .",
    "the classical interspecies collision rate is obtained by integrating the interspecies collision rate over the trap and we find@xcite @xmath75 where @xmath41 is the relative velocity between the two atoms , @xmath76 is the total number of atoms and @xmath77 the interspecies cross section . for @xmath15na",
