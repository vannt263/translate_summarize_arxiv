    "the simultaneous flow of two immiscible fluids in porous media , otherwise known as two - phase flow @xcite , is getting increasing attention of both the scientific and industrial communities .",
    "these flows are encountered in many industrial and geophysical applications , such as carbon sequestration and oil recovery , groundwater management , blood flow in capillary vessels , catalyst supports used in automotive industry , bubble generation in microfluidics and many more .",
    "extensive study of hydrodynamics in porous media is crucial for the development of these applied processes .",
    "while single - phase flows have been well characterized , many phenomena of steady - state immiscible two - phase flows in porous media are still not adequately understood .    in single - phase flow ,",
    "the macro - scale pressure gradient ( @xmath1 ) over a porous medium scales linearly with the superficial fluid velocity governed by darcy s law @xcite .",
    "this is also true in the case of two - phase flows at high fluid velocities when capillary forces are negligible .",
    "however , at slow velocities when the capillary forces are comparable with the viscous forces , the total pressure gradient in the steady state does not scale linearly with the flow rate . in a fundamental experiment of two - phase flow of air and water - glycerol mixture in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) model porous media made of glass beads in hele - shaw cell @xcite , it was observed that @xmath1 scales with the flow rate by a power law with an exponent @xmath4 . in a different experiment of two - phase flow in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) porous medium , similar power law scaling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 was observed , but the exponents were found to vary in the range between @xmath5 to @xmath6 depending on the saturation @xcite .",
    "this question about the non - linear relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 in steady - state two - phase flow of immiscible newtonian fluid was addressed in detail by sinha _",
    "it was shown that the capillary barriers at the interfaces between the fluids effectively create an effective yield threshold , making the fluids reminiscent of a bingham viscoplastic fluid in the porous medium introducing an overall threshold pressure @xmath2 in the system .",
    "a generalized darcy equation was then obtained with mean - field calculations , where @xmath0 depends quadratically on an excess pressure drop ( @xmath3 ) for low capillary numbers ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the capillary number is a dimensionless number which describes different regimes of flow , defined as the ratio of the viscous to the capillary forces at the pore level given by @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is the effective viscosity of the system , @xmath10 is the surface tension and @xmath11 is the fluid velocity which is equal to the flow rate per cross - sectional pore area . when other parameters are constant , @xmath7 will therefore be proportional to the flow rate , @xmath0 .    for a single capillary tube with a narrow pore - throat",
    ", there will be no flow through it as long as the pressure drop ( @xmath12 ) across the tube is less than the capillary barrier ( @xmath13 ) . above the threshold pressure",
    ", the average flow rate @xmath14 through one tube can be obtained for the steady - state conditions by integrating the instantaneous linear two - phase flow equation over the whole tube .",
    "the problem becomes equivalent to a forced over - damped oscillator , providing a threshold pressure followed by a square - root singularity given by @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the sign function and @xmath17 contains the terms related to permeability .",
    "close to the threshold , when @xmath18 , the average flow @xmath19 .",
    "this relationship leads to the non - linear conductivity of a single capillary given by @xmath20 in the steady - state . using this expression of @xmath21 for each link",
    ", a mean - field theory was developed to find the relationship of the total flow rate for a homogeneous disordered network @xcite . for a spatially uncorrelated distribution of threshold pressures , one obtains @xmath22 where @xmath23 is length of the network , @xmath24 is a constant with units of inverse pressure and @xmath25 is the effective permeability as a function of the non - wetting fluid saturation @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath9 is the effective viscosity of the system given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the viscosities of the wetting and the non - wetting fluids respectively . for the high flow rates ,",
    "there is a transition , beyond which the two - phase flow rate varies linearly with the total pressure drop . this quadratic relationship between @xmath0 and the excess pressure drop ( @xmath3 ) at low @xmath7 and the crossover to the newtonian flow regime at high @xmath7 were also verified with extensive numerical simulations .",
    "however , the simulations were performed only for regular 2d networks of disordered tubes and not for 3d pore networks .",
    "this situation of two - phase flow of two immiscible newtonian fluids in a disordered network is similar to the flow of a bingham viscoplastic fluid in a disorder network @xcite . for a bingham fluid inside a uniform tube ,",
    "no fluid flows as long as the pressure across the tube is less than a threshold value and the flow is linear above the threshold .",
    "there are more complicated non - trivial flow regimes that exist for bingham fluid flowing through a rough channel depending on the roughness @xcite .",
    "when a bingham fluid flows through a network of uniform tubes with a distribution of disorder in the thresholds , it was shown that there is an overall threshold pressure ( @xmath2 ) for the whole network . the threshold pressure along one continuous flow - path throughout the entire system is the sum of all the thresholds along that path and the minimum sum along all such possible paths corresponds to the threshold pressure @xmath2 for the entire system .",
    "the fluid starts flowing beyond @xmath2 and any further increase in the pressure difference across the network by a value @xmath30 will cause an increase in the number of conducting links @xmath31 in the network . with a reasonably smooth distribution of thresholds , we can consider @xmath32 and the change in the conductance @xmath33 of the network can then be written as @xmath34 .",
    "the increase in the flow rate @xmath35 , and integration over these will lead to the same quadratic relationship shown in equation [ effdarcy ] @xcite .",
    "when all the links are conducting beyond a certain pressure drop , @xmath33 becomes constant and then there is the crossover where @xmath0 becomes linear with @xmath36 .",
    "notice that , the flow - rate through one link above the threshold pressure varies linearly with the excess pressure drop for a bingham fluid whereas in two - phase flow through a single varying - diameter capillary it is non - linear , but still the two phase flow in a disorder network effectively behaves similar to a bingham viscoplastic fluid in the steady state .",
    "the experiments on two - phase flow @xcite have shown this non - linear quadratic dependence between flow rate and pressure drop but the existence of the threshold pressure was not investigated in any experiment . in support of the experimental results observed in the 2d experiment ,",
    "a scaling theory was proposed in @xcite showing @xmath37 without considering a threshold pressure drop .",
    "the scaling theory was based on the assumption that the fluids flow through different channels and there are stuck clusters in between them .",
    "the scaling theory is as follows .",
    "let us consider a 2d porous media of width @xmath38 and length @xmath23 where the overall pressure drop as well as the total flow is in the direction of length @xmath23 .",
    "there is a number of flow channels @xmath39 in the direction of overall flow .",
    "a characteristic length - scale @xmath40 in between the channels is considered and therefore @xmath41 . the flow through each channel is then , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the cross section of one channel and @xmath44 is the permeability of a channel .",
    "the total flow through all the channels is then @xmath45 . in order to find the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath1",
    ", it is assumed that the stuck clusters in between the channels are held in place by capillary forces @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 is the diameter of such a cluster , then the viscous pressure drop around it will be @xmath48 , which should be @xmath49 in order for the cluster to be held in place . considering @xmath50 for the largest cluster which is not moving and assuming that the separation of the channels , @xmath40 , is the same as the largest non - moving cluster diameter , i.e. , @xmath51 , one finds @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "though this scaling theory shows the quadratic dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 , it does not contain any threshold pressure .",
    "moreover , if we extend this theory in 3 dimensions , the number of channels @xmath39 should be equal to @xmath54 and following the same arguments we will find @xmath55 for 3d .",
    "this is contradictory to the mean field theory @xcite , according to which the quadratic relationship does not depend of the dimensionality of the network .",
    "secondly , the 3d experiments reported in ref @xcite showed that , without considering the threshold pressure , the log - log plot of @xmath0 and @xmath1 shows a variation in the slope in the range @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "those experiments were performed for a short range of capillary numbers and were difficult to draw any definitive conclusions from .",
    "it is therefore very important to perform extensive experiments and numerical simulations of two - phase flow in 3d porous medium to find the exact non - linear dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and to check whether the scaling exponent varies with dimensionality of the system .    to our knowledge there",
    "is very little experimental work exploring these flows using a three - dimensional pore network . in this article , we present an extensive experimental and numerical study of the steady - state two - phase flow of immiscible newtonian fluids . in the following ,",
    "first we will present the experimental study of steady - state two - phase flow of air and deionized water .",
    "this work utilizes a three - dimensional porous medium , resulting in a more chaotic flow and increased fluctuations around a mean value .",
    "significant work was done to collect high fidelity data and to accurately obtain the average differential pressures in the steady - state .",
    "we will then present our numerical work , describing the network model of two - phase flow in three dimensional reconstructed pore networks . from our experimental and computational results",
    ", we will show that there exists a global threshold pressure @xmath2 , below which there is no flow through the system .",
    "the results are highly significant in understanding the non - newtonian two - phase flow behavior of newtonian fluids due to the dominant capillary forces in a disordered system .",
    "the experimental setup of two - phase flow of deionized water as the wetting fluid and air as the non - wetting fluid through the column of borosilicate glass beads.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    experiments were performed on a three - dimensional porous medium confined in a vertical column .",
    "the porous medium was comprised of randomly distributed borosilicate glass beads with diameter @xmath56 and porosity @xmath57 ( cospheric llc , santa barbara , ca ) .",
    "these micro - spheres were wet - filled and well packed into a waters ap-1 mini chromatography column with inner diameter @xmath58 and length @xmath59 .",
    "filters at the inlet and outlet of the column consisted of a bed of glass microfibers and fine plastic mesh .",
    "the mesh allowed for uninhibited fluid flow , yet prevented the loss of glass beads .",
    "the filters aided in mixing the fluids to further homogenize the two phases before entering the porous media .",
    "this was done to emulate the alternating inlet boundary conditions as used in other experiments @xcite or simulations @xcite and to minimize the slug - like flow of alternating fluids .",
    "the two immiscible fluids used in this study were deionized water as the wetting fluid , and air as the non - wetting fluid , having respective dynamic viscosities @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "this provides the viscosity ratio @xmath62 equal to @xmath63 .",
    "the air - water surface tension at room temperature is around @xmath64",
    "the bond number comparing gravitational effects to the surface tension , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the difference in density of the fluids and @xmath67 the gravitational acceleration , is around 0.001 .",
    "if we assume the size of an air bubble in the system is of the order of the column diameter @xmath68 mm , the ratio between the buoyancy and the capillary force is @xmath69 making it possible to ignore gravitation in the analysis .",
    "two teledyne isco model 500d syringe pumps were used to control the bulk flow rates of each respective fluid , which were then combined in a junction just above the column inlet .",
    "polyetheretherketone ( peek ) tubing ( sigma - aldrich co. ) and stainless steel fittings ( swagelok ) comprised the flow system , and a sintered stainless steel @xmath70 filter element was used before the inlet to collect any small particulates in the inlet fluids and homogenize the phases .",
    "an omega px409 differential pressure transducer measured the pressure gradient over the column of glass micro - spheres .",
    "pressure data was acquired using national instrument s labview at a sampling rate of @xmath71 samples per second , although sample compression was used to average @xmath71 samples into one data point , yielding one binned data point per second .",
    "a schematic of the experimental setup can be seen in figure [ expt - setup ] .",
    "our experimental study is focused on measuring the scaling coefficient @xmath72 related to the scaling of the flow rate and the excess pressure drop , @xmath73 , which has been shown to be independent of fractional flow , saturation and viscosity ratio @xcite .",
    "our experiments use non - wetting fractional flow @xmath74 allowing for the volume of both syringe pumps to be fully utilized .",
    "all experimental parameters were kept constant except the flow rates of the fluids , so the overall bulk flow rate was varied initially in order to reach the desired capillary number .",
    "this paper focuses on experiments carried out at capillary numbers @xmath75 to @xmath76 . before each experiment ,",
    "the bead pack was initially saturated with water ( no air flow ) which provided consistency between experiments .",
    "the experiments were conducted by simultaneously starting the flow of both water and air at the same flow rate , resulting in the desired non - wetting fractional flow of @xmath77 .",
    "the total flow rate @xmath0 for any given capillary number @xmath7 is obtained from the fluid velocity @xmath11 given by @xmath78 , and then multiplying it with the effective cross - section @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "here @xmath9 is the effective viscosity at room temperature .",
    "the effective cross - sectional area @xmath79 is obtained from the total cross - sectional area of the bead pack multiplied with its porosity ( @xmath57 ) . the volumetric flow rate for each fluid ( air and water ) is then half of the calculated total flow rate @xmath0 .",
    "due to the compressibility of the air , the phases likely competed at the junction , causing some degree alternating injections of water and air .",
    "again , the filter was utilized as a means to reduce this phenomenon and create a more homogenized flow into the bead pack .",
    "the non - wetting saturation of the bead pack increased as air became randomly distributed throughout the porous medium .",
    "the confining column was borosilicate glass which provided for basic visual observations of the bead pack saturation .",
    "three sample pressure plots of the time evolution of the experiment are shown to demonstrate the chaotic and transient nature of the two - phase flow .",

    "the pressure gradient during the transient regime followed a chaotic , increasing trajectory . reaching the steady state regime , the pressure fluctuated around an average differential pressure @xmath1 .",
    "capillary forces between the competing phases manifest in large fluctuations of @xmath81 even at lower ca values .",
    "the @xmath1 fluctuations maintain the same overall magnitude and therefore more pronounced in the low @xmath7 regime when the absolute value of @xmath1 is lower .",
    "upon stopping the pumps we have @xmath82 , however , the pressure gradient over the column fell to a non - zero value which we identify as the threshold pressure @xmath2 .",
    "we were able to obtain experimental values for @xmath2 that slightly differed between experiments and took the average of these values as a global threshold pressure for the column , @xmath83kpa .",
    "as expected , the pressure gradient versus capillary number relationship scaled nearly linearly with @xmath84 for capillary numbers @xmath85 and higher . at low capillary numbers",
    ", it was shown that the pressure gradient relationship scaled non - linearly with @xmath86 .",
    "these values support the power scaling theory from sinha _ et al . _ and demonstrate that incorporating @xmath2 is crucial to obtain a consistent scaling factor of @xmath87 .",

    "some of this was explained initially by biofouling of the inline filter and mesh , which was avoided by adding a small amount of biocide to the flowing fluid .",

    "simplified networks consisting of pores and throats are reconstructed using different approaches .",
    "one approach is to use a statistical model @xcite where different statistical properties like the porosity distribution , correlation function and linear path function are estimated from the images of 2d thin sections of the sample .",

    "in this article , we presented our experimental and numerical study to investigate the relationship between the pressure drop and the volumetric flow rate in the steady - state two - phase flow of immiscible fluids in three dimensional porous media .",

    "we show that the capillary pressures at the interfaces in between the immiscible fluids introduce a pressure barrier at each pore and the presence of these barriers in the disorder pore - network effectively creates a yield threshold in the system , making the fluids to behave like a bingham viscoplastic fluid in a network @xcite .",
    "there are two regimes of the flow , in the regime where the capillary forces are comparable with the viscous forces , the flow rate varies quadratically with the excess pressure drop . with the increase in the flow - rate ,",
    "the capillary pressures become negligible and there is a crossover into a linear flow regime .",
    "both these two flow regimes are well demonstrated by our experiments and simulations in 3d .",
    "our results here in 3d are also in the agreement with the mean - field theory presented earlier @xcite which shows that the quadratic scaling does not depend on the dimensionality of the pore network .",
    "we have considered @xmath128 and @xmath123 in the simulations and @xmath74 in the experiments which are in the intermediate range of saturation or fractional flow . in this regime , both the fluids contribute to the flow and a large number of interfaces exist in the system introducing capillary barriers at each pore .",
    "if one moves towards @xmath129 or @xmath115 , the system will drift to the single - phase flow regime and eventually the interfaces as well as the capillary barriers will disappear .",
    "this should drive the system completely into the linear newtonian flow regime .",

    "<S> we present an experimental and numerical study of immiscible two - phase flow in 3-dimensional ( 3d ) porous media to find the relationship between the volumetric flow rate ( @xmath0 ) and the total pressure difference ( @xmath1 ) in the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the regime where capillary forces compete with the viscous forces , the distribution of capillary barriers at the interfaces effectively creates a yield threshold , making the fluids reminiscent of a bingham viscoplastic fluid in the porous medium , introducing a threshold pressure @xmath2 . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath0 depends quadratically on an excess pressure drop ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while increasing the flow - rate , there is a transition , beyond which the flow is newtonian and the relationship is linear . in our experiments , </S>",
    "<S> we build a model porous medium using a column of glass beads transporting two fluids  de - ionized water and air . for the numerical study , reconstructed 3d pore - networks from real core samples </S>",
