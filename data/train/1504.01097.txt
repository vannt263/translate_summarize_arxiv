    "finally in section 6 , application of the proposed model in count data analysis and count regression model is presented . some comments and conclusions",
    "are drawn in section 7 .",
    "shaw and buckley ( 2007 ) proposed a novel technique to introduce skewness and kurtosis into symmetric as well as to other distribution . in this",
    "techniques they use `` transmutation map '' , which is functional composition of cumulative distribution of one distribution with the quantile function of another .",
    "one such member of this transmuted family is `` transmuted exponential distribution '' @xmath2 whose density function given as @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 + considering the fact that @xmath2 possess wide range of statistical properties as compared to exponential distribution , we introduce a new mixed poisson distribution assuming @xmath2 as prior distribution for poisson parameter @xmath1 . the definition of purposed model is as follows +    a random variable @xmath6 is said to follow poisson - transmuted exponential distribution if it possess following stochastic representation @xmath7 for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "proof : _ if @xmath16 and @xmath17 then @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21    * remarks *    1 .",
    "it is easy to see that the p.m.f . in ( [ 2 ] ) can be rewritten as a finite mixture of two geometric distribution in the form , @xmath22 2 .   for @xmath23 pmf ( [ 2 ]",

    "3 .   for @xmath25 pmf ( [ 2 ] ) reduces to geometric distribution @xmath26 .",
    "further , the cumulative distribution function and the survival function of @xmath27 @xmath12 can be given as @xmath28 and @xmath29 + figure 1 shows the pmf of @xmath12 for different values of @xmath30 which confirms the unimodality of random variable , moreover , this can proved mathematically in proposition 1 . +    [ f1 ]   and @xmath31.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the proposed distribution with p.m.f .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) is unimodal .    _",
    "proof : _ the probabilities defined in ( [ 2 ] ) can also be computed by following recursive relation @xmath32 with @xmath33 + moreover , it can be observe that ( [ 6 ] ) possess relation @xmath34 for @xmath35(mode of @xmath36 r.v . ) depending on parameters @xmath37 and @xmath31 , which indicate the unimodality , see keilson and gerber ( 1971 ) . +",
    "further , @xmath38    for @xmath39 , the distribution is infinitely divisible since @xmath40 and @xmath41 , see warde and katti ( 1971 ) for details .",
    "then , in this case the distribution has its mode at zero .",
    "the fact that @xmath42 , forms a monotone increasing sequence in this case requires that @xmath43 be a decreasing sequence ( see johnson and kotz , 1982 , p.75 ) , which is congruent with the zero vertex of the new distribution for @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , as any infinitely divisible distribution defined on non - negative integers is a compound poisson distribution ( see proposition 9 in karlis and xekalaki , 2005 ) , we conclude that the new pmf presented in this paper is a compound poisson distribution .",
    "furthermore , the infinitely divisible distribution plays an important role in many areas of statistics , for example , in stochastic processes and in actuarial statistics .",
    "when a distribution @xmath44 is infinitely divisible then for any integer @xmath45 , there exists a distribution @xmath46 such that @xmath44 is the @xmath47fold convolution of @xmath46 , namely , @xmath48 .",
    "also , when a distribution is infinitely divisible an upper bound for the variance can be obtained when @xmath39 ( see johnson and kotz , 1982 , p.75 ) , which is given by @xmath49    some implications of infinite divisibility are as follows :    1 .",

    "the cumulants of an infintely divisible distribution on the set of non  negative integers ( as far as they exist ) are non negative , see steutel and van harn ( 2004 ) , p. 47 , corollary 7.2 .",
    "this will imply that the skewness of the new distribution is positive , since the third cumulant equals the third central moment .",
    "the distribution is strictly log - concave and strongly unimodal , see theorem 3 in keilson and gerber ( 1971 ) .    as indicate in above remark ,",
    "since ( [ 2 ] ) is log - concave and zero vertex for some value of parameter @xmath37 and @xmath31 , we can determine the mode@xmath54 of @xmath12 , which will be determine such the @xmath55 is increasing on @xmath56 and decreasing on @xmath57 .",
    "it can be easily verified-    1 .   for @xmath58 ,",
    "the pmf ( [ 2 ] ) is unimodal and the mode is at @xmath59 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath60 ,",
    "the mode of pmf ( [ 2 ] ) will be at @xmath61 , with @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 . here [ . ]",
    "denotes the integer part .",
    "further if @xmath64 $ ] is an integer , then pmf ( [ 2 ] ) will be bimodal and the mode is at @xmath35 and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "+ @xmath21    moreover , the new distribution is as a mixed poisson distribution it has a heavier tail than a poisson distribution with the same mean .",
    "now , let @xmath65 be the probability function ( [ 2 ] ) and @xmath66 be the probability function of a simple poisson distribution with the same mean , say @xmath67 .",
    "then , as shown by feller ( 1943 ) , @xmath68 and @xmath69 . the asymptotic tail behavior of poisson distributions was studied for willmot ( 1990 ) .",
    "+ in the following results , we present various properties such as taylor expansion for @xmath70 probabilities , probability generating function , moments , hazard function of @xmath71 +      ong(1995 ) gave the taylor series expansion of mixed poisson distribution which is stated as : + let @xmath72 be the probability density function ( pdf ) of the mixing distribution of a mixed poisson distribution . if g(x ) has a finite @xmath73 derivative at the point @xmath74 for all @xmath75 , then the mixed poisson pmf @xmath76 has the formal expansion @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the @xmath81 moment about the mean of the gamma random variable @xmath6 with scale and shape parameters 1 and @xmath82 respectively .",

    "<S> in this paper , a new mixed poisson distribution is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> this new distribution is obtained by utilizing mixing process , with poisson distribution as mixed distribution and transmuted exponential distribution as mixing distribution . some distributional properties like unimodality , moments , over - dispersion , taylor series expansion of proposed model are studied . </S>",
    "<S> estimation of the parameters using method of moments , method of moments and proportion and maximum likelihood estimation along with data fitting experiment to show its advantage over some existing distribution . </S>",
    "<S> further , an actuarial applications in context of aggregate claim distribution is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss a count regression model based on proposed distribution and its usefulness over some well established model .    </S>",
