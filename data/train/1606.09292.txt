    "the minimal @xmath0 extension of the standard model ( sm ) , which is based on the gauge group @xmath2 , provides a satisfactory explanation for the non - zero neutrino masses @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "sm singlet fermions are naturally introduced in order to cancel the associated anomaly .",
    "these particles are accounted for right - handed neutrinos and hence a seesaw mechanism can be obtained .",
    "it was shown that light neutrino masses can be generated within @xmath0 extension of the sm through either type - i seesaw @xcite or inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite . in type - i seesaw mechanism",
    "right - handed neutrinos acquire majorana masses at the @xmath0 symmetry breaking scale , therefore the neutrino s yukawa coupling must be @xmath3 , while in inverse seesaw these majorana masses are not allowed by the @xmath0 gauge symmetry and another pair of sm gauge singlet fermions with tiny masses @xmath4 kev must be introduced .",
    "one of these two singlets fermions couples to right handed neutrino and is involved in generating the light neutrino masses .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that in a susy context , the @xmath0 and susy scales can be correlated through the mechanism of radiative breaking of @xmath0 symmetry , similarly to the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in mssm @xcite . in particular , it was proven that the radiative corrections in @xmath0 extension of the mssm ( blssm ) with type i seesaw may drive the squared mass of extra higgs boson from positive initial values at the gut scale to negative values at the tev scale , leading to spontaneous breaking of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the energy scale of @xmath0 breaking is naturally related to the susy breaking scale .",
    "however , it was pointed out @xcite that the breaking of @xmath0 in this model depends crucially on the large value of the right - handed neutrino yukawa coupling and it is possible to break the @xmath0 through the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the right - handed sneutrino . in this case",
    "@xmath1-parity is also spontaneously broken and the resulting model will have quite involved phenomenology .    in this paper we analyze the radiative @xmath0 symmetry breaking in blssm with inverse seesaw ( blssm - is ) .",
    "we show that the breaking of @xmath0 occurs for a wider region of parameter space through the vev of the higgs singlet .",
    "we consider the renormalisation group equations ( rges ) to show explicitly that for wide range of parameters the squared mass of the higgs singlet can be negative at tev scale while the squared mass of the right - handed sneutrino remains positive .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vev of this singlet and @xmath1-parity remains exact .",
    "in addition , using the program of vevacious @xcite , we analyze the vacuum stability in both blssm - is and blssm - type i. we show that , unlike the blssm - type i , in blssm - is the vev of right - handed sneutrino is always close to zero and much less than the vev of the singlet scalar that breaks the @xmath0 and keeps @xmath1-party conserved .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we analyze the rge running and the radiative @xmath0 symmetry breaking in blssm with inverse seesaw and compare it with the results of the blssm with type i seesaw . in section 3",
    "we investigate the vacuum stability in the blssm - is and also in blssm - type i. we conclude in section 4 .",
    "tev scale blssm - is is based on the gauge group @xmath5 , where the @xmath6 is spontaneously broken by chiral singlet superfields @xmath7 with @xmath0 charge @xmath8 as in conventional @xmath0 model , a gauge boson @xmath9 and three chiral singlet sueperfields @xmath10 with @xmath0 charge @xmath11 are introduced for the consistency of the model .",
    "finally , three chiral singlet superfields @xmath12 with @xmath0 charge @xmath13 and three chiral singlet superfields @xmath14 with @xmath0 charge @xmath15 are considered to implement the inverse seesaw mechanism @xcite .",

    ", we assume that the particles , @xmath22 , @xmath7 , and @xmath14 are even under matter parity , while @xmath12 is an odd particle . the @xmath0 symmetry can be radiatively broken by the non - vanishing vacuume expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite . the tree level potential @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "i.e. _ , if @xmath31 this condition is not satisfied at the gut scale with universal soft breaking terms .",
    "however , as we will show , similar to the mssm scalar higgs masses , the running from a large scale down to tev scale , @xmath32 and @xmath33 will have different renormalization scales so that the minimization condition is eventually satisfied , and hence , the @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the minimization conditions , @xmath34 , lead to the following equations : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "these two equations are similar to the electroweak symmetry breaking conditions in mssm which are used to determine the value of @xmath38 and @xmath39 parameters at the electroweak scale .",
    "it is worth noting that in mssm , where @xmath40 , one can not satisfy the condition of non - vanishing vevs and @xmath41 unless the running from gut to weak scale reduces @xmath42 to negative values , thanks to the large yukawa coupling of @xmath43 with top quark .",

    "the conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be simultaneously satisfied with positive @xmath46 , if @xmath47 . before elaborating this point , let us consider the running of the scalar masses @xmath46 and also the right - handed sneutrino squared masses , @xmath48 , via the @xmath0 renormalization group equations ( rges ) in both type i and inverse seesaw mechanisms .",

    "i superpotential : @xmath50 and the trilinear coupling @xmath51 is defined as usual as @xmath52 .",

    "the last term proportional to @xmath49 in these equations derives the mass squared negative at tev scale .",
    "therefore , is clear that @xmath48 can be negative before @xmath54 ( due to the large coefficient of @xmath49 in the rge of @xmath48 ) . in this case of hierarchal @xmath49 , both @xmath0 and @xmath1-parity",
    "will be spontaneously broken @xcite . however , in case of @xmath55 , the equations take the form 16 ^ 2 & = & -12 g_bl^2 m_bl^2 + 12 y^2__r ( m__1 ^ 2 + a__r^2 + 2 m^2__r ) , + 16 ^ 2 & = & -3 g_bl^2 m_bl^2 + 8 y^2__r ( m__1 ^ 2 + a__r^2 + 2 m^2__r ) .",
    "therefore it is expected that @xmath54 becomes negative at tev scale while @xmath48 remains positive , so @xmath0 symmetry is spontaneously broken and @xmath1-parity remains exact @xcite .    in inverse seesaw ,",
    "the relevant rges are given by 16 ^ 2 & = & -12 g_bl^2 m_bl^2 + 2 m__1 ^ 2 tr(y_s y_s^ ) + 2 tr(y^a^*_s y^a^t_s ) + 2 tr(m^2__2 y^_s y_s ) + 2 tr(m^2__r y_y^ _ ) , + 16 ^ 2 & = & -12 g_bl^2 m_bl^2 , + 16 ^ 2 & = & -3 g_bl^2 m_bl^2 + 2 m__1 ^ 2 y_s y_s^+ 2 y^a_s y^a^_s + 4 y^a _",

    ", one can see that in inverse seesaw scenario the evolution of @xmath54 and @xmath48 depends on the relative strength of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the case of hierarchal yukawa ,",
    "@xmath54 can be of order or slightly smaller than @xmath48 if @xmath60 . from the rges of @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "one can notice that @xmath59 must be @xmath61 , to avoid a possible landau pole at high scale , while @xmath58 can be of order one . in these conditions ,",

    "[ tadapole2 ] are satisfied . as intimated , these conditions do not require negative mass squared scalar masses and with @xmath62 , symmetry can be broken with @xmath63 .",

    "[ rge - blssmis ] we display the scale evolution of the higgs masses @xmath46 and also the scalar masses @xmath69 and @xmath70 based on the numerical solution of complete rges derived by using sarah @xcite , for @xmath71 tev and @xmath72 is assumed . as can be seen from this figure",
    ", @xmath73 drops rapidly to the negative region , while @xmath74 and other scalar masses remain positive at tev scale .",
    "analogously to the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking in mssm , this mechanism works with large yukawa coupling .",
    "it is worth mentioning that unlike the type i seesaw blssm , here the scalar mass @xmath69 remains positive at the low scale independently of the initial values .",
