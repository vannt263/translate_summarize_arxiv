    "the production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has long been considered a possible diagnostic for the appearance of exotic qcd phases in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . in particular",
    "it has been anticipated that the charmonium production cross section in central @xmath7 reactions will be suppressed if a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed , since the long - range @xmath6 confining potential will be screened within the qgp . however ,",
    "this diagnostic can be confounded by subsequent charmonium dissociation due to inelastic hadron rescattering  comover absorption \" , which also contributes to the depletion of initially produced charmonium .",
    "alternatively , charmonium can be regenerated due to rescattering of open - charm hadrons in the late stages of heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a thorough understanding of these soft hadronic final state interactions is required before one can make confident statements regarding qgp production based on charmonium production cross sections @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of an understanding of these soft processes is now expected to extend well into the deconfined phase , since recent lattice computations indicate that low lying charmonia survive as resonances up to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , little experimental information exists regarding these charmonium dissociation cross sections .",
    "some simple phenomenological estimates based on ` pre - vector meson dominance ' @xcite and absorption cross sections in heavy ion collisions @xcite give @xmath9 mb and @xmath10  gev@xmath11  mb respectively .",
    "alternatively , @xmath12 photoproduction yields a @xmath13 cross section of approximately 3.5 mb@xcite while a combined analysis of @xmath12 production from @xmath14 collisions gives a result of 7 mb @xcite . for more detailed predictions of the relevant near - threshold cross sections one must employ theoretical models of these scattering processes .",
    "theoretical estimates have employed a variety of methods , and ( perhaps not surprisingly in view of the lack of low - energy experimental data ) predict cross sections that vary over several orders of magnitude in the relevant kinematic regime .",
    "early estimates by kharzeev and satz @xcite using the color - dipole diffractive model of bhanot and peskin @xcite ( which is only justified at high energies ) gave extremely small near - threshold @xmath0 total cross sections , typically of microbarn scale .",
    "more recently , @xmath0 dissociation cross sections have been estimated using meson exchange models @xcite , assuming for example @xmath15-channel charmed meson exchange or an su(4)-symmetric hadron effective lagrangian .",
    "results from these models for meson-@xmath12 scattering cross sections near thresholds are typically in the few mb range .",
    "similar computations have been reported for @xmath0 scattering @xcite , which also find total cross sections near threshold in the few mb scale .",
    "although these meson exchange models are of great interest as possibly realistic descriptions of these near - threshold processes they suffer from uncertainties due to poorly understood vertex form factors , fock space truncations in the set of exchanged particles , and the questionable assumption of higher symmetry groups such as su(4 ) ( this implicitly assumes a close relationship between the dynamics of pions and heavy - quark @xmath6 mesons ) .",
    "regarding hadronic form factors , several groups @xcite have found a strong suppression of the predicted dissociation cross sections on incorporating plausible hadronic form factors .",
    "many of the problems encountered in previous approaches are avoided if one implements a  microscopic \" quark - gluon description of these scattering processes , for example using the constituent quark model .",
    "the earliest application of this approach to charmonium dissociation is the work of martin _",
    "et al._@xcite , who applied the method of ref.@xcite to @xmath16 and @xmath17 scattering .",
    "_ assumed that the confining interaction only operated between @xmath18-@xmath19 pairs ; a more conventional quark - gluon model of charmonium dissociation cross sections based on the usual @xmath20 color structure has been developed by wong _",
    "these approaches describe hadronic interactions and bound states in terms of the nonrelativistic quark model , and usually assume that the scattering amplitudes are given to sufficient accuracy at born order in the quark - gluon interaction ( this can be relaxed of course ) . at born order in these valence @xmath21 annihilation",
    "free channels hadron - hadron scattering occurs by constituent interchange , and the scattering amplitudes and cross sections can be derived analytically if sufficiently simple wavefunctions are employed ( for example simple harmonic oscillator forms ) .",
    "applications of this approach to a wide range of similar scattering processes without valence annihilation , such as i=2 @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite have shown that this leads to numerically realistic results for many short - ranged s - wave scattering processes .    in this paper",
    "we report the first results for charmonium dissociation due to scattering from nucleons in this type of constituent quark scattering model @xcite .",
    "these amplitudes are also relevant to the time - reversed process of charmonium regeneration , and may prove useful in future studies of bound states of charm and nuclei , as suggested by brodsky _",
    "the born - order quark interchange model approximates hadron - hadron scattering as due to a single interaction of the standard quark - model interaction hamiltonian @xmath25 between all constituent pairs in different hadrons @xcite .",
    "for the calculations reported here we employ a constituent quark model interaction of the form      where the sum extends over all quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the three terms in this expression are respectively the color coulomb interaction , linear confinement , and a regularized contact spin - spin hyperfine interaction .",
    "the model parameters have elsewhere been fitted to meson and baryon spectra ( see appendix  [ app1 ] for their values ) .",
    "the color structure of eq .",
    "[ hi ] is given by the usual quadratic perturbative form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 for a quark and @xmath29 for an antiquark ( @xmath30 is a gell - mann matrix ) .",
    "meson - baryon systems do not have trivial color dynamics ( _ i.e. _ , a fixed color state with an overall constant color factor ) , in contrast to mesons and baryons individually , so the assumed color structure of eq.[hi ] affects the relative amplitudes for different channels .",
    "of course this @xmath27 color structure represents a severe truncation of the full dynamics of the gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this model does however reproduce the relevant low - energy features of more complete models , and the @xmath27 form is known to be realistic in describing lattice confinement potentials as well as the interactions of low lying hadrons .",
    "we now consider the generic inelastic two - body scattering process @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a @xmath6 charmonium state , @xmath33 is a nucleon , @xmath34 is an open - charm @xmath35 meson , and @xmath2 is an open - charm @xmath36 baryon .",
    "( here , @xmath37 is a light @xmath38 or @xmath39 quark . )",
    "it is convenient to label the quarks as @xmath40_{12 } [ q_1 q_2 q_3]_{345}$ ] .",
    "we choose the ( 45 ) quark pair to have definite symmetry under @xmath41 quark interchange .",
    "quark interchange scattering in all the systems considered here involves the specific quark permutations @xmath42 and @xmath43 . by inspection ,",
    "@xmath42 permutations give rise to @xmath44 final states in @xmath45 collisions , and @xmath46 states in @xmath47 collisions .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 interactions involving the permutation operator @xmath49 give @xmath50 final states , and from @xmath47 one produces @xmath51 final states .    due to @xmath41 symmetry",
    "only four unique spatial matrix elements are encountered ; these are summarized in table  [ symtab ] .",
    "the first row gives labels specifying the interaction potentials @xmath52 .",
