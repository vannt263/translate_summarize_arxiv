    "the study of tachyons and their condensation processes has been a longstanding challenge in string theory . during recent years",
    ", the interest in branes has added significantly to the relevance of this issue since open string tachyons occur in various configurations of stable branes , the most important being the brane - antibrane system .",
    "fortunately , unstable brane configurations turned out to be much more tractable than bulk backgrounds with instabilities such as e.g.   the 26-dimensional bosonic string .",
    "in fact , various different approaches have been employed over the last five years , including string field theory ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite for a review ) , effective field theory models ( see @xcite for some early work ) , and world - sheet conformal field theory ( see e.g.   @xcite and references therein ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "sen initiated the study of _ exact time - dependent solutions_. one goal of his work was to find a world - sheet description of so - called s - branes @xcite , i.e.  of branes that are localized in time . in this context",
    "he proposed to add a @xmath1-shaped boundary interaction to the usual world - sheet model of d - branes in a flat space - time , @xmath2 \\ = \\ \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int_\\sigma                    d^2 z \\ , \\eta_{\\mu\\nu } \\partial x^\\mu                   \\bar \\partial x^\\nu + \\int_{\\partial \\sigma }                    d u \\",
    ", \\lambda \\cosh x^0(u ) \\ \\ .\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 denotes the time - coordinate and we have chosen units in which @xmath4 .",
    "with such an interaction term the open string tachyon becomes large at early and late times and hence , according to an earlier proposal of sen @xcite , is believed to dissolve the brane for @xmath5 .",
    "unfortunately , the world - sheet model ( [ senact ] ) appears to be ill - defined without an additional prescription to select the proper vacuum . to resolve this issue",
    ", sen argued that the appropriate choice for super - string computations would be determined by wick rotation from the corresponding euclidean theory .",
    "this suggestion relates the study of open string tachyon condensation to the so - called boundary sine - gordon model @xmath6   \\ = \\ \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int_\\sigma d^2 z\\ ,        \\partial x \\bar \\partial x + \\int_{\\partial \\sigma } du       \\ , \\lambda \\cos x(u)\\ ] ] in which @xmath7 is a field with space - like rather than time - like signature .",
    "all spatial coordinates @xmath8 have been suppressed here since their contribution to the model is not affected by the interaction .",
    "the boundary sine - gordon theory has been studied rather intensively , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review some of the most important results . to begin with , we point out that the boundary interaction is exactly marginal so that the theory is conformal for all values of @xmath9",
    ". properties of the model , however , depend crucially on the strength @xmath9 of the boundary potential .",
    "in fact , it is well known that variations of @xmath9 allow to interpolate smoothly between neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the former appear for all integer values of @xmath9 ( in particular for @xmath10 , of course ) while the latter are reached when @xmath11 . at these points ,",
    "the theory describes a one - dimensional infinite lattice of d0 branes . from the geometric pictures we can infer that the spectra of boundary excitations must also depend drastically on the parameter @xmath9 . in fact , at the points @xmath12 with neumann boundary conditions , the open string spectrum is continuous .",
    "if we now start tuning @xmath9 away from these special values , the spectrum develops band gaps which become wider and wider until we reach the dirichlet points @xmath13 at which the spectrum is discrete .",
    "the first computation of the spectrum for generic values of @xmath9 can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a much more elegant derivation ) .    despite of these significant insights into the structure of the boundary sine - gordon model , there are several important quantities that remain unknown .",
    "this applies in particular to the boundary 2- and 3-point functions and the bulk - boundary operator product expansions . in the string theoretic context , these missing data determine the time - dependence of open string couplings on a decaying brane and the back - reaction to the bulk geometry .",
    "our desire to understand such important quantities is one of the main motivations to study the following , closely related world - sheet theory @xcite , @xmath14 \\ =",
    "\\ \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int_\\sigma                    d^2 z \\ , \\eta_{\\mu\\nu } \\partial x^\\mu                   \\bar \\partial x^\\nu + \\int_{\\partial \\sigma }                    d u \\ , \\mu_b \\exp x^0(u ) \\ \\ .\\ ] ] this model has been named time - like boundary liouville theory . since the tachyon vanishes in the far past , the model seems to describe a half - brane , i.e. a brane that dissolves as time progresses .",
    "after wick rotation @xmath15 , the theory of the time coordinate becomes .",
    "this might be relevant for comparisons with previous results in models with exponential interactions . ]",
    "@xmath16   \\ = \\ \\left ( \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\int_\\sigma d^2 z\\ ,        \\partial x \\bar \\partial x + \\mu \\exp 2b x(z,{\\bar{z } } ) +        \\int_{\\partial \\sigma } du \\ ,",
    "\\mu_b \\exp b x(u)\\right)^{\\mu=0}_{b = i }       \\ \\ .\\ ] ] we have written the interaction term for general parameters @xmath17 and also added a similar interaction in the bulk , mainly to emphasize the relation with boundary liouville theory .",
    "what makes this relation so valuable for us is the fact that boundary liouville theory has been solved over the last years @xcite .",
    "needless to stress that the solution includes explicit formulas for the bulk - boundary structure constants @xcite and the boundary 3-point couplings @xcite .",
    "there is one crucial difference between liouville theory and the model we are interested in : whereas the usual liouville model is defined for real @xmath17 , our application requires to set @xmath18 .",
    "a continuation of results in liouville theory from @xmath19 to @xmath0 ( i.e.  @xmath18 ) might appear to be a rather daring project , even more so as a naive inspection of the world - sheet action would suggest the @xmath0 model could not possibly be unitary .",
    "nevertheless , we shall show below that the theory is entirely well - defined and unitary . for the pure bulk theory ,",
    "a similar result was established in @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that the bulk 3-point couplings of liouville theory possess a @xmath18 limit which is well - defined for real momenta of the participating closed strings .",
    "the @xmath18 theory , however , is no longer analytic in the momenta .",
    "furthermore , the limit turned out to agree with the @xmath0 limit of unitary minimal models which was constructed by runkel and watts in @xcite .",
    "our analysis here extends these findings to the boundary theory .",
    "we shall see that the latter is considerably richer than the bulk model .",
    "some qualitative properties of the @xmath0 boundary model can be understood using no more than a few general observations . to begin with ,",
    "let us reconsider the simpler bulk model .",
    "recall from ordinary liouville theory that it has a trivial dependence on the coupling constant @xmath20 . since any changes in the coupling can be absorbed in a shift of the zero mode",
    ", one can not vary the strength of the interaction .",
    "this feature of liouville theory persists when the parameter @xmath17 moves away from the real axis into the complex plane .",
    "as we reach the point @xmath18 , our model seems to change quite drastically : at this point , the ` liouville wall ' disappears and the potential becomes periodic .",
    "standard intuition therefore suggests that the spectrum of closed string modes develops gaps at @xmath18 .",
    "but since the strength of the interaction can not be tuned in the bulk theory , the band gaps must be point - like .",
    "though our argument here was based on properties of the classical action which we can not fully trust , the point - like band - gaps are indeed a characteristic property of the @xmath0 bulk theory @xcite .",
    "these band - gaps also explain why the couplings of liouville theory cease to be analytic when we reach @xmath0 .    for the boundary theory",
    ", we can go through a similar argument , but the consequences are more pronounced . in the presence of a boundary , liouville theory contains a second coupling constant @xmath21 which controls the strength of an exponential interaction on the boundary of the world - sheet and is a real parameter of the model .",
    "in fact , the freedom of shifting the zero mode can only be used for one of the couplings @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "once more , the boundary potential becomes periodic at @xmath18 and hence the open string spectrum should develop gaps , as in the case of the bulk model . but this time , the width of these gaps can be tuned by changes of the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "hence , we expect the boundary liouville theory to possess gaps of finite width at @xmath0 .",
    "our exact analysis will confirm this outcome of the discussion .",
    "after these more qualitative remarks on the model we are about to construct , we shall summarize our main results in more detail . in section 3",
    "we shall provide the boundary states for a family of boundary conditions of the @xmath0 liouville theory that is parametrized by one parameter @xmath22 .",
    "formulas for these boundary states are trivially obtained from the corresponding expressions in @xmath23 liouville theory and , as we shall also explain , through particular limits of boundary theories in minimal models .",
    "we shall then use both approaches to establish the existence of finite band gaps in the boundary spectrum of the @xmath0 boundary theories .",
    "more precisely , we show that boundary fields @xmath24 in the boundary theory with parameter @xmath25 carry a momentum whose allowed values are taken from the following set @xmath26 when @xmath25 is a half - integer , the set @xmath27 fills the entire real line .",
    "as we vary @xmath25 away from such half - integer values , the allowed momenta are restricted to intervals of decreasing width until we reach integer values of @xmath25 where the spectrum of boundary fields becomes discrete . in this sense",
    "the parameter @xmath25 interpolates between neumann - type and dirichlet - type boundary conditions .",
    "let us note that the boundary conditions with @xmath28 are related to those constructed by runkel and watts in @xcite .",
    "all other boundary theories , however , are new .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out how closely the @xmath0 limit of liouville theory mimics the behavior of the boundary sine - gordon model . in both theories",
    "we can interpolate smoothly between continuous and discrete boundary spectra .",
    "even the geometric interpretation of the dirichlet points is very similar : in the context of the @xmath0 liouville model they describe a semi - infinite array of point - like branes from which individual branes can be removed through shifts of the boundary parameter @xmath25 .",
    "let us point out that finite arrays of such point - like branes are described by the @xmath0 limit of zz branes .",
    "that parametrize the zz branes correspond to the transverse position and the length of the finite array . ]",
    "hence , the picture we suggest for the dirichlet points of the @xmath0 fzzt branes provides a nice geometric interpretation for the well - known relation of fzzt and zz branes in liouville theory @xcite .",
    "there are two important quantities that we shall construct for all these new boundary theories .",
    "these are the boundary 2-point function and the bulk - boundary 2-point function . for the former we obtain @xmath29 \\\\[3 mm ]   \\mbox { where } & & \\r^{s_1s_2}_{c=1}(p ) \\ = \\",

    "it is quite remarkable that the reflection amplitudes of the two models are related in such a simple way .",
    "let us point out , though , that the boundary reflection amplitude for the @xmath0 theory is only defined within a subset @xmath33 of momenta @xmath34 .",

    "the other keeps a rapidly oscillating factor .",

    "before we conclude this section , we would like to comment briefly on the band - gaps .",
    "actually , we can use the analysis of the bulk - boundary couplings to confirm our previous statement that boundary fields @xmath279 with @xmath280 decouple from the theory . to this end , we shall focus on the coefficients @xmath281 of the bulk boundary operator product expansion rather than the couplings @xmath35 .",
    "the former are related to latter by multiplication with the boundary 2-point function .",
    "our claim is that the coefficients @xmath282 vanish within the band - gaps . as we have seen before",
    ", the 2-point function contributes a factor that diverges when @xmath272 . with the help of our asymptotic expansion formulas in this section it is possible to show that the couplings @xmath35 always diverge slower",
    "hence , boundary fields whose momenta lie in the gaps can not be excited when a bulk field approaches the boundary .",
    "in this work we have constructed boundary conditions of the euclidean @xmath0 liouville model .",
    "in particular we argued that there exists a family of boundary conditions that is parametrized by one real parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we provided explicit expressions for their boundary states ( see eq .",
    "( [ 1ptfceq1 ] ) ) , the boundary 2-point function ( [ 2ptfctres1],[reflb ] ) , and the bulk - boundary coupling ( [ bcoupl ] ) . the only quantity that we are missing for a complete solution of the model is the boundary 3-point coupling . in the case of liouville theory , the corresponding formulas have been found by ponsot and teschner in @xcite .",
    "we believe that the analysis of their @xmath0 limit can proceed along the lines of the studies we have presented in section 5 , but obviously this program remains to be carried out in detail .",
    "a crucial ingredient in our study was the formula ( [ gasym ] ) for the asymptotics of barnes double gamma function . in section 2 ,",
    "the latter enabled us to provide a new derivation of the bulk couplings in the @xmath0 liouville model .",
    "our approach here is simpler and more general than the one that was developed in @xcite . with this technical progress",
    "it is now also possible to calculate the bulk couplings of non - rational conformal field theories with @xmath116 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath0 case , the models with @xmath116 are certainly non - unitary .",
    "we will comment on the results and their relation with minimal models elsewhere .",
    "possible applications of such developments include the 2-dimensional cigar background with @xmath283 @xcite and similar limits of the associated boundary theories @xcite .",
    "all this research , however , was mainly motivated by the desire to construct an exact conformal field theory model for the homogeneous condensation of open string tachyons , such as the tachyon on an unstable d0 brane in type iib theory . as we explained in the introduction , the underlying world - sheet theory is a lorentzian version of the model we have considered in this work .",
    "but since the couplings of our theory are not analytic in the momenta ( with the boundary state being the only exception ) , this lorentzian theory can not be obtained by a simple wick rotation from the solution we described here .",
    "instead , it was suggested in @xcite to perform the wick rotation before sending @xmath17 to its limiting value @xmath18 .",
    "such a prescription makes sense because the couplings of liouville theory are analytic in the momenta as long as @xmath17 is not purely imaginary .",
    "it is certainly far from obvious that the wick rotated couplings again possess a well - defined @xmath18 limit .",
    "preliminary studies of this issue show that our analysis of the boundary 2-point function extends to the lorentzian case . in the time - like model ,",
    "the spectrum of boundary fields is continuous ( there are no gaps ) and their 2-point function is still given by eq .",
    "( [ 2ptfctres1 ] ) with a reflection amplitude @xmath284 this result does not agree with the proposal in @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in the lorentzian case the correlation functions can depend on the details of how @xmath17 approaches @xmath18 .",
    "such a behavior might be related to a choice of vacuum .",
    "let us also anticipate that consistency of our expression for the boundary 2-point coupling with the half - brane boundary states @xcite can be checked by means of the modular bootstrap . a related observation , though with a somewhat problematic domain of open string momenta , has also been made in @xcite .",
    "concerning the bulk - boundary coupling , our investigations are not complete yet .",
    "but before having worked out the expression in the lorentzian model , it is worthwhile comparing our formula ( [ bcoupl ] ) for the bulk - boundary coupling with a corresponding expression in the time - like theory that was suggested recently in @xcite ( eq . [ 4.14 ] of that paper ) .",
    "in fact , the exponential in the second line of our formula is identical to a corresponding factor in the work of balasubramanian et .",
    "it will be interesting to determine the other factors through our approach .",

    "<S> most importantly , we show that the fzzt branes of liouville theory give rise to a new 1-parameter family of boundary theories at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these models share many features with the boundary sine - gordon theory , in particular they possess an open string spectrum with band - gaps of finite width . </S>",
    "<S> we propose explicit formulas for the boundary 2-point function and for the bulk - boundary operator product expansion in the @xmath0 boundary liouville model . as a by - product of our analysis </S>",
    "<S> we also provide a nice geometric interpretation for zz branes and their relation with fzzt branes in the @xmath0 theory .     </S>"
