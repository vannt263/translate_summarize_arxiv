    "our goal is to explore the applicability of lattice gauge actions for qcd , which are designed such that small plaquette values are strongly suppressed .",
    "if such an action can be identified , we expect the following virtues :    * an acceleration of dynamical fermion simulations * control over the topological charge .",
    "in particular we hope for applications in the @xmath0-regime of qcd @xcite . in that regime ,",
    "the pion compton wave length clearly exceeds the box length , @xmath1 , which is an unphysical situation .",
    "however , simulations in a such small volume may provide physically significant information , since the low energy constants of chiral perturbation theory take the same values as in a large volume .",
    "hence the hope is to evaluate them without the requirement of a large lattice .",
    "however , this implies several conditions for the lattice formulation : the lattice fermions should keep track of the chiral symmetry and give access to very light pions .",
    "moreover , the topological charge @xmath2 needs a sound definition , since the measurements are performed at distinct @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "both of these requirements are provided by _ ginsparg - wilson fermions _ : they have an exact , lattice modified chiral symmetry @xcite , and the fermionic index defines @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "their simulation is now possible , at least quenched @xcite .",
    "recent results were obtained for the dirac spectrum @xcite and for meson correlation functions @xcite .",
    "in particular the neuberger dirac operator @xcite can be applied . its index  and hence the topological sector",
    " can not change as long as each plaquette variable @xmath5 obeys the constraint @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the plaquette action .",
    "therefore @xmath2 is fixed under continuous deformations of the gauge configuration if we use the plaquette action @xmath8 , with @xmath9^{\\alpha } } & &   s_p ( u_p ) < \\varepsilon   \\\\",
    "+ \\infty & & { \\rm otherwise } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] for @xmath10 .",
    "this lattice gauge action ( for @xmath11 ) was introduced by m.  lscher for conceptual purposes @xcite , and applied by fukaya and onogi in schwinger model simulations @xcite .",
    "the use of such a lattice gauge action has the advantages that the continuum property of stable topologies is reproduced , and that tedious computations of the index can be saved .",
    "finally it allows for the cumulation of statistics in a specific topological sector ; first experience in the @xmath0-regime shows that in particular @xmath12 are useful ( the sector @xmath13 suffers from strong fluctuations , and at @xmath14 quenched chiral perturbation theory @xcite fails in volumes with box length @xmath15 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "an obvious problem is that due to the constraint implemented in @xmath16 the physical lattice spacing tends to be very small . for practical simulations",
    "we hope that @xmath17 values clearly above the theoretical bound still suppress topological transitions sufficiently .",
    "for instance , in the schwinger model @xmath18 already stabilized @xmath2 over hundreds of configurations @xcite .",
    "and the modified plaquette action @xmath19 . below : ratio between forces in configuration space , which drive the local hmc algorithm._,title=\"fig : \" ] +   and the modified plaquette action @xmath19 . below : ratio between forces in configuration space , which drive the local hmc algorithm._,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ act_for ]    since gauge actions of the type ( [ salpha ] ) are non - linear in the link variables , the heat bath algorithm can not be applied .",
    "instead we use a local hmc algorithm @xcite . compared to the wilson action",
    ", the force is just changed by an extra factor on each plaquette , @xmath20 the new plaquette action @xmath19 and the force @xmath21 are illustrated as functions of the standard plaquette action @xmath22 in fig .  [ act_for ] .",
    "and @xmath23 , on a @xmath24 lattice .",
    "_ ]    we set @xmath11 and as a first experiment we searched for the line of a constant plaquette variable @xmath25 on a @xmath24 lattice , as @xmath26 and the action parameter @xmath17 are varied . the result is shown in fig .  [ conspla ] . as we decrease @xmath17 , very small values of @xmath23",
    "are needed to keep the plaquette constant .    as a more serious approach to identify a line of a constant physical scale , we now proceed to a @xmath27 lattice and measure @xmath28 ( at @xmath29 ) following the standard procedure , see e.g.  ref .",
    "finite size effects are expected to be on the percent level for our results presented in table [ r0tab ] ( though we only indicate the statistical error ) .",
    "._results for the physical scale @xmath28 on a @xmath27 lattice at different values of @xmath30 and @xmath23 .",
    "we add the corresponding @xmath23 value for the wilson gauge action , which we denote as @xmath31 .",
    "finally we display the autocorrelation time with respect to @xmath32 , and with respect to the plaquettes , in our mc history .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we also performed first tests of the topological stability .",
    "in order to arrive at a quick first impression this was done with cooling and searching for the first plateau of the action ( which is not sensitive to the sign of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the histories for @xmath33  ignoring instanton / anti - instanton cancellations  are shown in fig.[qhisto ] .",
    "we recognize a clear progress in view of the topological stability as @xmath17 decreases along a line of approximately constant physics .",
    "this can also be quantified by the autocorrelation in these histories , as the fifth column in table [ r0tab ] shows .    on the other hand , the last column in table [ r0tab ]",
    "shows that the decorrelation with respect to the plaquette values becomes even better as @xmath17 decreases ( at a fixed scale ) .",

    "they correspond approximately to the same physical scale._,title=\"fig : \" ] +        `` topology conserving gauge actions '' could be highly profitable in qcd simulations .",
    "the suppression of small plaquette values may speed up the simulations with dynamical quarks .",
    "a stable @xmath2 is useful in particular in the @xmath0-regime .",
    "we are exploring the applicability of such actions , in view of the physical scale and the topological stability .",
    "this is an ongoing project . at present",
    "we have first promising candidates for suitable parameters which provide topological stability to some extent , while keeping the physical lattice spacing at a reasonable value .",
    "future tests will involve index measurements to verify the topological stability .",
    "at last we mention that the gauge action ( [ salpha ] ) has the problem that once a plaquette violates the constraint , a force in the wrong direction sets in .",
    "hence such configurations had to be rejected .",
    "this happens more frequently as @xmath17 is decreased .",
    "we now want to test variants of the action ( [ salpha ] ) , where the denominator is replaced by a quadratic or exponential factor in order to avoid this problem , and also in view of the caveat pointed out in ref @xcite .",
