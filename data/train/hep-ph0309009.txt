    "the original ccfm splitting function is given by : @xmath2 with @xmath3 and with the non - sudakov form factor @xmath4 defined as : @xmath5 here only the singular terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 were included and for simplicity the scale in the running @xmath8 was not treated in the same way for the small and large @xmath9 part .    due to the angular ordering a kind of random walk in the propagator gluon can be performed . for values of @xmath10 the non - perturbative region",
    "is entered , which is avoided in a strictly -ordered evolution ( dglap ) .",
    "the region of small   is characterized by @xmath8 and the parton density being large , and collective phenomena , like gluon recombination or saturation might play a role . at such small",
    "the total cross section is expected to rise only weakly with energy , equivalently to a constant @xmath11 for small @xmath1 and @xmath12 .",
    "a practical treatment is therefore to fix @xmath13 to @xmath14 for @xmath15 . until @xmath16 is reached ,",
    "no gluon emissions are allowed , but energy - momentum conservation is properly treated . in the * js * unintegrated gluon density @xcite , the soft region",
    "was defined by @xmath17  gev . in the new sets presented here ,",
    "@xmath18 was chosen , with @xmath19 being the collinear cut for the real emissions ( the scale for resolvable branchings ) .    following the arguments in @xcite",
    ", it was investigated in @xcite to change the scale in @xmath8 to @xmath20 everywhere , in @xmath6 part of the splitting function as well as in the non - sudakov form factor . from eq.([non_sudakov_int ] ) it is obvious , that a special treatment of the soft region ( and the lower integration limit ) is needed , because @xmath21 can become very small and even @xmath22 at small values of @xmath23 .",
    "the problematic region in the non - sudakov form factor in eq.([non_sudakov_int ] ) is avoided by fixing @xmath13 for @xmath24 gev  @xcite : @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the number of active flavours .",
    "the integration limits are defined by @xmath28 , @xmath29 gev and @xmath30 .",
    "however in practical application we observe only a small effect from changing the scale of the small @xmath9 part from to .    at very high energies",
    ", the @xmath6 term in @xmath31 will certainly be dominant .",
    "however , at present colliders the non - singular terms , as suggested in @xcite should also be included : @xmath32    as already mentioned before , the change of the scale in @xmath8 from to does not produce significant differences . for simplicity , is still taken as the scale for the small @xmath9 part in the non - sudakov form factor .",
