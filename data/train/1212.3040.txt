    "as early as 1950s it has been demonstrated theoretically  @xcite , and later confirmed experimentally  @xcite that bounded metallic structures ( e.g. , thin films ) , as well as other bounded plasmas  @xcite , can support a special type of collective oscillations of the plasma electrons , surface plasma waves , also called surface plasmons ( sp ) , that propagate along the plasma boundaries and whose field and energy density are concentrated near the boundaries .    since then , there has been a significant advance in theoretical and experimental investigations of surface plasma waves and their applications in various bounded plasma structures , both in the field of plasma science ( see refs  @xcite and references therein ) and in the fields of condensed matter and surface science ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . currently , there is a renewed interest in surface plasmons due to their ability to concentrate light in subwavelength structures , enabling to create surface plasmon - based circuits that can couple photonics and electronics at nanoscale  @xcite .",
    "this offers a route to faster and smaller devices , and even to new technologies employing surface plasmons  @xcite .",
    "for example , one of the recent interesting advents in the new area of quantum nanoplasmonics is the development of the concept of spaser ( a surface plasmon `` laser '' )  @xcite , followed by its further development into a lasing spaser  @xcite , and by an experimental demonstration of a spaser - based nanolaser  @xcite .    in view of these developments , understanding the properties of surface plasmons in various metallic ( and semiconductor ) structures , bounded by vacuum or dielectric , is thus important .",
    "this requires using models for the dynamic response of charge carriers in such structures to self - consistent electromagnetic fields , that appropriately take into account the relevant effects arising from quantum nature of the charge carriers in such structures and from their interaction with the underlying ion lattice .",
    "such quantum effects may significantly alter the properties of the surface waves ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in general , the electric field of a surface plasmon has both longitudinal and transverse components , i.e. , a surface plasmon is , in general , an electromagnetic wave coupled with a collective oscillation of surface charge ; such a hybrid electromagnetic surface wave is called a surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) .",
    "the properties ( dispersion and damping ) of spp in a semi - bounded degenerate plasma ( e.g. , a metal ) are a subject of this paper .    in the non - retarded limit ,",
    "when the spp phase velocity is much smaller than the speed of light , the spp field becomes purely electrostatic . in this limit",
    ", the spp corresponds to a longitudinal surface charge density wave ; its properties are thus affected only by the longitudinal part @xmath9 of the plasma dielectric response .",
    "recently , the properties of such purely electrostatic surface plasmons ( esp ) in a semi - bounded plasma with degenerate electrons were analyzed using the semi - classical kinetic model  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the spatial dispersion of degenerate plasma has a significant effect on the frequency and damping rate of esp at short wavelengths , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the esp wave vector component along the plasma boundary , @xmath12 is the esp wavelength , and @xmath13 is the thomas - fermi length ( @xmath14{3\\pi^2 n_e}/m_e$ ] is the fermi velocity of plasma electrons , @xmath15 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath18 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath19 is the electron number density in plasma ; we use cgs units ) .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to generalize the work on electrostatic surface plasmons in a semi - bounded collisionless degenerate plasma  @xcite , and consider the properties of electromagnetic surface plasmons , or surface plasmon polaritons , in a semi - bounded degenerate plasma with electron - ion collisions ( e.g. , spps in a semi - bounded metal where the electron - lattice collisions play a significant role ) .",
    "in particular , we consider effects of plasma spatial dispersion , and collisions , on spp dispersion and damping . we show that the collisionless damping of spps ( due to spatial dispersion of a metal ) is comparable , or even exceeds the purely collisional ( ohmic ) damping of spps ( due to electron - lattice collisions ) in a wide range of wavelengths , e.g. , from @xmath20  nm to @xmath21  nm for spps in gold at @xmath5  k , and from @xmath6  nm to @xmath7  nm for spps in gold at @xmath8  k. the spatial dispersion is also shown to affect the spp spectrum , especially at short wavelengths ( less than the collisionless skin depth , @xmath2 ) , where the spatial dispersion changes spp spectrum in a qualitative way .",
    "we conclude that the spatial dispersion ( due to quantum degeneracy of plasma electrons ) is rather important for damping , and , to a lesser extent , for dispersion of spps in a semi - bounded degenerate plasma ( e.g. , a bounded metal ) , and should be taken into account in the relevant spp models .",
    "we consider a semi - bounded , nonrelativistic plasma ( e.g. , a metal ) with degenerate mobile electrons ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electron temperature in energy units , @xmath24 is the electron fermi energy ) , and immobile ions ; the equilibrium number densities of electrons and ions are equal , @xmath25 ( quasineutrality ) .",
    "the plasma is assumed to be confined to a region @xmath26 , with mirror reflection of plasma particles at the boundary @xmath27 separating the plasma from a vacuum at @xmath28 . in the absence of fields ,",
    "the equilibrium distribution function of plasma electrons @xmath29 is defined by an isotropic fermi - dirac distribution , which in the limit @xmath22 reduces to @xmath30 \\right\\}^{-1 } = \\frac{2}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^3 } \\sigma\\left[p_f(n_e)-p\\right ] ,   \\label{eq : f0e}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the electron fermi momentum , @xmath32 is the heaviside step function .    following the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite , we adopt here the quasiclassical kinetic description of plasma electrons in terms of the 1-particle distribution function @xmath33  @xcite , whose evolution is described by the kinetic equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 describes collisions of electrons with particles of sort @xmath36 , i.e. , with electrons and ions . here",
    "we are only interested in the electron - ion collisions ( due to coherent scattering of electrons on the ions , which in metals is equivalent to electron - phonon scattering ) , which transfer the energy of quiver motion of electrons in the field of collective plasma oscillations ( in particular , in the field of spp ) to the `` ionic thermal bath '' ( e.g. , ion lattice in metals ) , resulting in spp damping .",
    "in general , collisions between degenerate electrons and non - degenerate classical ions can be described by the quantum lennard - balescu collision integral  @xcite @xmath37 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the electron distribution function can be approximated as @xmath46 , with a perturbation @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the angle between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and where @xmath51 is assumed ( due to the field being weak ) . in this case",
    "the electron - ion collision integral ( [ eq : i_ei_balescu ] ) reduces to  @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electron - ion collision frequency for electrons with momentum @xmath49 , defined as  @xcite @xmath54 note that ( [ eq : tau_ei_gen ] ) is obtained by assuming static screening , @xmath55 , for simplicity .",
    "the structure function @xmath56 in ( [ eq : tau_ei_gen ] ) depends on the arrangement of ions in the system considered , and can be obtained from experimental measurements of x - ray scattering on the corresponding medium  @xcite .    yet in case of a weak _ non - uniform _ oscillating field ( e.g. , the self - consistent field of plasma collective oscillations , such as spps ) , the perturbation @xmath57 is no longer proportional to @xmath58 , and thus the integral ( [ eq : i_ei_balescu ] ) no longer reduces to the simple form ( [ eq : i_eq_reduced ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the form ( [ eq : i_eq_reduced ] ) is rather attractive due to its simplicity , and it is thus desirable to use this form in our model , especially since it becomes _ exact _ for fields that are close to uniform , i.e. , for plasma perturbations with @xmath59 .",
    "we therefore adopt a _ model _ collision integral describing collisions of electrons with the heavy plasma ions ( e.g. , with the ion lattice in metals ) in the form of bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) integral  @xcite : @xmath60 ,   \\label{eq : i_ei_bgk}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the quasi - equilibrium distribution of electrons given by ( [ eq : f0e ] ) with @xmath62 , in which @xmath19 and @xmath23 are the _ perturbed _ electron density and temperature , defined as @xmath63 the model collision integral ( [ eq : i_ei_bgk ] ) conserves the number of particles , and energy , and mimics the relaxation of electron distribution towards the quasi - equilibrium distribution @xmath61 , occurring over the characteristic time @xmath64 .",
    "the value of @xmath65 can be estimated as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 from ( [ eq : tau_ei_gen ] ) , for which the knowledge of the structure function @xmath56 is required .",
    "however , for a crude estimate ( sufficient for our model bgk integral ) , we can simply use the dc resistivity of the bulk plasma , @xmath68 , which is available for most metals from experimental measurements .",
