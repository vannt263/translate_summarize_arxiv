    "perhaps the most prominent example is the hawking effect @xcite which predicts the evaporation of black holes .",
    "there are two alternatives for the investigation of this striking effect : originally hawking calculated the bogoliubov coefficients via the geometric optics approximation ( backwards ray - tracing ) in ref .",
    "in contrast to this dynamical treatment unruh @xcite imposed boundary conditions on the state in the static _ rgime _ in order to reproduce the main features of the hawking effect . since the state defined in this way",

    "of course , in general there exists some temporary amount of created particles that depends on the dynamics of the collapse . but according to ref .",
    "@xcite the number of these particles is finite with the result that they disperse after a finite period of time and thus do not affect the ( divergent ) late - time radiation .",
    "ergo it appears quite natural to assume that the state after the complete gravitational collapse coincides up to a finite number of particles with the unruh state describing evaporation  independently of the particular dynamics of the collapse",

    "focusing on a sub - algebra a pure state may display properties that are usually connected with mixed states .",
    "this observation might be regarded as the basis of the thermo - field formalism , see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it might be interesting to illustrate these points by some examples : the space - time obeying the schwarzschild geometry possesses a killing vector mediating the associated ( schwarzschild ) time - evolution .",
    "the ground state of the quantum field ( with respect to that killing vector ) in the region outside the horizon is called the boulware @xcite state @xmath39 .",
    "it contains no particles  again with respect to the killing vector measuring the time of an outside observer with a large and fixed spatial distance to the center of gravity .",

    "obviously these states are mixed in character  at least from the exterior point of view .",
    "one important example is the israel - hartle - hawking @xcite state @xmath43 which satisfies ( in the exterior region ) the kms condition corresponding to the hawking temperature .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that this state is indeed a pure state with respect to an enlarged algebra .",
    "the israel - hartle - hawking state @xmath43 contains the same number of ingoing and outgoing particles ( thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "hence the total energy flux vanishes .",
    "the phenomenon of the black hole evaporation can be described by the unruh @xcite state @xmath44 .",
    "this state is defined via two requirements : no ingoing / incoming particles / radiation at spatial infinity and thermal outgoing radiation near the horizon , see also @xcite .",
    "if one considers a gravitational collapse of an object and assumes the initial state to be pure in character ( e.g.  the vacuum ) then the final state is  of course  also a pure state .",
    "( here the notion of a pure state refers in both cases to the complete algebra . )",
    "the question of whether the initial state indeed transforms into the unruh state will be subject of section [ particle ] .",
    "in general , the complete convex set is too large and contains more states than physical reasonable .",
    "one way to restrict to physically well - behaving states is to impose the so - called hadamard @xcite condition .",
    "hadamard states are states for which the symmetric part of the bi - distribution @xmath45 the two - point wightman @xcite function , obeys the following singularity structure ( in a 3 + 1 dimensional space - time ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 symbolizes the principal part",
    ". the antisymmetric part of @xmath48 must be consistent with the commutation relation ( [ green ] ) .",

    "hence all information about the state @xmath30 enters @xmath55 only .    one important advantage of the hadamard requirement may be illustrated by considering the regularization of expectation values of two - field observables , for instance the energy - momentum tensor @xmath60 .",
    "the hadamard singularity structure ensures the validity of the point - splitting renormalization technique , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for a globally hyperbolic @xmath0 ( i.e.  infinitely differentiable ) space - time @xmath61 the hadamard condition is conserved , i.e. , if the two - point function has the hadamard singularity structure in an open neighborhood of a cauchy surface , then it does so everywhere @xcite .    if one considers the gravitational collapse of an object which can be described by a @xmath0-metric the above theorem can be used to deduce the hadamard condition for the final state .",
    "( the initial state is assumed to be a regular excitation over the ground state and thus satisfies the hadamard requirement .",
    "the minkowski vacuum of course meets the hadamard structure with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . ) on the other hand it can be shown that if the state of a field @xmath4 fulfills the hadamard requirement ( among further not as strict assumptions , cf .",
    "@xcite ) in the whole space - time of the schwarzschild geometry and especially at the horizon then the asymptotic expectation values correspond exactly to a thermal radiation with the hawking temperature @xmath65 ( see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "combining the two statements above we are able to deduce the hawking temperature for any collapse scenario that can be described by a @xmath0-metric .",
    "it might be interesting to discuss the previous considerations by means of some examples for the schwarzschild geometry . applying the theorems above to the boulware state ,",
    "i.e.  the ground state , it follows immediately that this state can not satisfy the hadamard requirement  at least at the horizon .",
    "indeed this state is singular at the horizon ",
    "its ( point - splitting ) renormalized energy density diverges there @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "it can be shown that the boulware state as well as every kms state ( with an arbitrary temperature ) fulfills the hadamard requirement _ away _ from the horizon @xmath68 , see @xcite .",
    "but only the kms state corresponding to the hawking temperature , i.e.  the israel - hartle - hawking state ( after a suitable extension ) meets the hadamard structure _ at _ the horizon , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , the initial ( approximately minkowski ) vacuum can not transform into this state during a gravitational collapse of an object , cf .",
    "in contrast to the unruh state the israel - hartle - hawking state represents thermal equilibrium also for @xmath69 and the associated amount of particles and energy can not be produced by a collapse , see also secs .",
    "[ bogoliubov ] and [ discussion ] below .",
    "within the heisenberg representation the time - evolution of the quantum system is governed by the operators while the states remain unaffected .",
    "hence the investigation of the hawking effect goes along with the question : how many ( final ) schwarzschild particles contains the initial state ?",
    "in general , this number depends on the particular initial state and the initial metric as well as the dynamics of the metric during the collapse . according to the considerations in the previous section we assume a @xmath0-metric throughout .",
    "it can be shown that the hawking effect ( i.e.  the late - time radiation ) is independent of the ( regular ) initial space - time , see sec .  [ bogoliubov ] below .",
    "similarly any finite amount of particles being present initially does not alter the assertions concerning the hawking effect ( see the remarks at the end of section [ bogoliubov ] below ) . for that reason we assume the initial state to coincide with the ( initial ) vacuum .",
    "in this situation the number of final particles can be calculated via the bogoliubov @xmath70-coefficients , see e.g.  @xcite @xmath71 in order to calculate these coefficients we have to derive the structure of the initial modes @xmath72 after the collapse and to compare them with the out - solutions @xmath73 by means of the inner product in eq .",

    "the particle interpretation in quantum field theory is based on the selection of an appropriate time - like killing vector .",
    "this choice refers to a certain class of associated observers whose time - evolution is generated by the killing field .",
    "for the flat space - time example , the killing vector mediating the ( minkowski ) time translation symmetry accords to a usual beholder at rest whereas special lorentz boosts represent accelerated ( rindler ) explorers . since , in general , different killing vectors generate distinct particle definitions , the rindler observer does not regard the minkowski vacuum as empty with respect to ( rindler ) particles .",
    "instead , he / she experiences a thermal bath , a phenomenon which is called the unruh effect @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the unruh as well as the anti - unruh state  the state @xmath260 is @xmath257 invariant : @xmath264 .",
    "therefore the unitarity and time - reversibility problem mentioned above in connection with the ( anti ) unruh state does not necessarily apply to this state .    in sec .",
    "[ bogoliubov ] we have observed that only the region near the horizon generates contributions that are relevant with respect to the hawking effect .",
    "exactly the leading terms in @xmath145 and @xmath78 give rise to the uv - divergence accounting for the hawking effect .",
    "the notion of the vicinity of the horizon as the region that is essential for the hawking effect may be illustrated via the following _ gedanken _ experiment : let us imagine a very thin shell of matter with slowly decreasing radius .",
    "as long as the radius of the shell is larger than the associated schwarzschild radius the number of created and radiated particles remains finite as a consequence of the regularity of the metric and the associated _ eigen_modes . if the shell were to stop shrinking before it reached its schwarzschild radius , no hawking effect would be observed .",
    "accordingly , the creation of particles accounting for the hawking effect occurs exactly in the space - time region of the formation of the horizon .    in order to support the argumentation in sec .",
    "[ eikonal - ansatz ] concerning the independence and separation of the different branches ( e.g.  corresponding to ingoing and outgoing components ) in eq .",
    "( [ branch ] ) we may consider a conceptual clear scenario  where the effective boundary condition at @xmath95 does not contribute at all  described in the following _ gedanken _ experiment : at first we suppose a small amount of highly charged matter to collapse at the center of gravity forming a tiny extreme reissner black hole .",
    "the surface gravity of such a black hole vanishes with the result that there is no hawking radiation ( at this stage ) . after the formation of the small black hole",
    "the point @xmath95 is hidden by the corresponding horizon .",
    "consequently , there is no `` reflection '' at the origin @xmath95 in this case .",
    "( it is possible to define ingoing and outgoing particles separately , cf .",
    "if we now suppose the matter ( enclosing the tiny black hole ) to collapse the origin can not generate a mixing of the different branches ( e.g.  ingoing and outgoing ) .",
    "for the calculation of the bogoliubov coefficients we have restricted our consideration to the 1 + 1 dimensional space - time of the @xmath81-sector .",
    "even though the main result of this article should persist also in 3 + 1 dimensions ( including the angular terms ) , some additional complications arise @xcite .",
    "the klein - fock - gordon equation ( [ kfg ] ) assumes for the 3 + 1 dimensional schwarzschild metric a slightly modified form . after separating the angular dependence by spherical harmonics",
    "the centrifugal barrier and curvature scattering effects can be incorporated into an effective potential @xmath265 , see e.g.  @xcite @xmath266 @xmath265 is strictly positive and approaches zero for @xmath267 and for @xmath214 with @xmath268={\\cal o}[1/r_*^2]$ ] and @xmath162={\\cal o}[\\exp\\{r_*/r\\}]$ ] , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , in 3 + 1 dimensions no closed expression ( in terms of well - known functions ) for the _ eigen_modes is available .",
    "the asymptotic behavior can be derived easily . for @xmath214",
    "the positive frequency solutions again behave as @xmath269 or linear combinations of them .",
    "these waves are purely ingoing or outgoing , respectively , for @xmath214 . but",
    "every mode which is purely outgoing near the horizon contains for @xmath267 ingoing components as well owing to the scattering at the effective potential @xmath265 ( inducing transmission and reflection coefficients ) and _ vice versa_. in order to obtain a complete and orthogonal ( with respect to the inner product ) set of positive frequency solutions of the klein - fock - gordon equation one has to combine the different opportunities .",
    "e.g. , within the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  1 there )",
    "a down mode is purely ingoing at infinity and ( therefore ) mixed at the horizon . according to the results of this article",
    "one would expect that an infinite amount of particles are created by the collapse in this mode  independently of the branch of the metric @xcite .",
    "furthermore the present article considers the most simple example of a quantum field theory , i.e.  the neutral , massless , and minimally coupled scalar field @xmath270 .",
    "further investigations should be devoted to fields obeying more complicated equations of motion . for",
    "the spin - zero field example one may incorporate potential terms including masses @xmath271 or conformal couplings @xmath272 and consider charged ( i.e.  non - hermitian ) fields .",
    "moreover , it would be interesting to extend the examination to fields with higher spin , e.g.  the electromagnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , there is no obvious reason why the main conclusions of this article should not persist .",
    "the evaluation of the hawking effect for interacting fields with non - linear equations of motion seems to be rather challenging .",
    "similarly the space - time under consideration describes the most simple example of a black hole .",
    "the schwarzschild geometry represents an uncharged and non - rotating black hole where the einstein tensor and thereby also the energy - momentum tensor vanish for @xmath125 .",
    "the extension of the results presented in this article to more general static ( i.e.  non - rotating ) black - holes  e.g.  the reissner solution",
    " seems to be straight - forward , see also @xcite .",
    "in contrast the investigation of rotating ( i.e.  stationary , but not static ) black - hole space - times ",
    "e.g.  the kerr solution  holds more difficulties .",
    "apart from the painlev - gullstrand - lematre coordinates there are several other coordinate sets that describe the schwarzschild geometry space - time by a manifestly @xmath0-metric , e.g.  the eddington - finkelstein coordinates",
    ". it might be interesting to consider a collapse model in terms of these coordinates in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ dynpgl ] ) and to compare the results .    however , one should be aware that all of the previous considerations neglect the back - reaction of the quantum field onto the metric .",
    "so far the quantum field is treated as a test field propagating on a given ( externally prescribed ) space - time . if one attempts to leave this formalism several problems arise : the concept of hadamard states as described in eq .",
    "( [ hadi ] ) is restricted to free fields obeying linear equations of motion .",
    "the two - point function of interacting fields possesses additional singularities in general . consequently  if one regards the treatment of quantum fields in classical ( general relativistic ) space - times as a low - energy effective theory of some underlying theory ",
    "the imposition of the hadamard condition is not obviously justified .",
    "similarly the requirement of a smooth @xmath0-metric may be questioned from this point of view .",
    "accordingly , it might be interesting to examine the consequences of collapse dynamics that are not @xmath0 regarding the hawking effect @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive clarification of these problems probably requires the knowledge of an underlying law that unifies quantum field theory and general relativity .",
