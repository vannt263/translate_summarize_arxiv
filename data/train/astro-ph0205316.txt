    "the question of how mass is distributed in clusters is long - standing @xcite .",

    "* though see @xcite ) .",
    "such results suggest that the density profiles of dark matter halos are quite sensitive to their histories of formation , accretion , and merging , as well as to the initial conditions of collapse @xcite , and these notions are tested explicitly by weinberg ( 2001 ) , who finds that noisy evolutionary processes can drive halo profiles to a uniform shape with soft cores .",
    "this result appears similar to the profile derived by iliev & shapiro ( 2001 ) , wherein the collapse of spherical top - hat density perturbations was shown to produce truncated isothermal spheres , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "the solutions of iliev & shapiro ( 2001 ) and weinberg ( 2001 ) may naturally produce soft cores because of the boundary condition of finite phase - space densities at @xmath23 .",

    "the determination of the mass profile from kinematics of cluster galaxies within this region has been difficult because there are generally few members .",

    "* ) , requires painstaking identification and spectroscopy of 20 - 200 discrete objects , and hernquist & bolte ( 1993 ) show that the resulting inferred mass profiles are subject to large ( @xmath28 factors of 2 ) uncertainties with such small samples .",
    "strong gravitational lensing measurements can allow one to infer the total surface mass density within the einstein radius but these constraints are susceptible to degeneracies @xcite and to uncertainties in the details of the potential @xcite .",
    "the mass profile can be better - constrained when there are several arcs , but the brightest cluster galaxies may themselves dominate the shapes of the total surface mass density profile , as may be the case in ms2137 - 2353 @xcite .",
    "weak lensing measurements are even less effective at constraining the inner mass profile , given the typical number densities of background galaxies as well as the comparatively large surface areas covered by the galaxies in cluster cores @xcite .",
    "a more promising method for constraining the mass profiles in the cores of rich clusters is to use the kinematics of stars in the extended halos of central cd galaxies ( `` intracluster starlight '' ) .",
    "past efforts to trace the stellar velocity dispersion profile of ic 1101 , in the cluster a2029 , to tens of kpc showed that @xmath29 rises from 400  to 600  towards larger radii @xcite .",

    "[ intro ] , the scale on the sky is @xmath45 kpc / arcsec .",
    "three @xmath39-band images of ngc 6166 , totaling 1870 seconds , and six @xmath40-band images , totaling 1280 seconds , were obtained with lris during the nights of 30 - 31 may 1998 .",
    "the images span @xmath46 square arcmin , corresponding to a distance along the major axis of 170 kpc .",
    "the seeing during the run was approximately 0.8 arcsec ( fwhm ) .",
    "a subsection of the @xmath39-band image is shown in figure [ finder ] .",
    "the sky background was determined for each image using the corners of the image furthest from the galaxy , and the sky brightness was then subtracted from the entire image ( in both bands ) . while errors in the sky will severely affect the derived surface brightness profile of the galaxy at radii approaching the extent of the imaging field - of - view",
    ", the accuracy in our estimate of the sky is suitable for deriving the surface brightness profile over the extent of the lris long - slit ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the @xmath39- and @xmath40-band sky brightnesses were approximately @xmath48 mag / arcsec@xmath49 and @xmath50 mag / arcsec@xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the fitting of elliptical isophotes was performed using the ellipse package of stsdas in iraf .",
    "the detection of 15 interloping galaxies necessitated modeling ( using the ellipse package ) and subtraction of their light from the images in both bands .",
    "isophotes were fit to these galaxies , as well as to the cd , and iteratively subtracted from the image .",
    "the envelope of one interloper intersects the major - axis between 2 kpc and 14 kpc at a mean level of about 15% of the cd surface brightness .",
    "the residuals from the subtraction of this particular interloper amounted to 5% of the cd surface brightness at those radii along the major - axis .",
    "such residuals were efficiently rejected by the sampling criteria in the final ellipse - fitting of the cd .",
    "we calibrated the @xmath39-band photometry using secondary standard stars in the galactic globular cluster m92 , with an error in the photometric zero - point of @xmath51 mag . calibrating",
    "the @xmath40-band photometry was problematic because the lris filter wheel had not properly inserted the ( johnson ) @xmath40 filter into the optical path for the m92 calibration image .",
    "as a result we used the cousins @xmath40-band surface brightness profile from @xcite to calibrate our data .",
    "the @xcite profile was first transformed from cousins @xmath40 to johnson @xmath40 using @xmath52 ( a good approximation for the spectral energy distributions of old e / s0s ; @xcite .",
    "we then determined the photometric offset between the lris profile and the transformed @xcite profile over the radial range of 5 to 40 arcsec .",
    "the @xmath53 of this offset was @xmath54 mag .",
    "the @xmath39-band extinction to ngc 6166 , as estimated by schlegel ( 1998 ) , is @xmath55 mag ( @xmath56 mag from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because this prediction is quite low and irrelevant for the determination of the mass profile we have made no correction for the foreground extinction ( it only affects the deduced stellar @xmath42 ratios at a level of @xmath57 )",
    "the final @xmath39- and @xmath40-band surface brightness profiles are shown in the left panel of figure [ sb_prof ] .      while isophote fitting provides the maximum signal - to - noise ratio in the surface brightness profile at a given radius , our kinematic profile will be derived along a fixed position angle ( the major - axis ) .",
    "thus it is more appropriate to use the surface brightness profile along this position angle in modeling the mass profile and constraining the mass model of the cd and its halo .",
    "we calculated the @xmath39- and @xmath40-band slit profiles from eight columns of the ccd image centered on the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the long - slit intensities were derived by averaging the eight columns of the slit position in order to produce a single intensity per pixel for each row along the slit . these @xmath39- and @xmath40-band long - slit surface brightness profiles",
    "are shown in the middle panel of figure [ sb_prof ] .",
    "the profiles in the right- and left - hand panels are virtually identical because there was very little twisting of the isophotes with radius .",
    "thus our mass modeling will be insensitive to the choice of the long - slit or isophote profile .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we use the profile derived at the position of the lris long - slit .",
    "the right - hand panel of figure [ sb_prof ] shows the @xmath58 color gradients derived from both the isophote fitting ( solid line ) and for the long - slit position ( dashed line ) .",
    "the color transitions smoothly from @xmath59 mag in the inner regions of the cd to @xmath60 mag at @xmath61 kpc to @xmath62 mag at @xmath63 kpc .",
    "these are colors which are typical for e / s0 , sa , and sbc galaxies , respectively @xcite .",
    "we find that the gradient is well fit by the second - order polynomial : @xmath64 ^ 2\\ ] ] with an  scatter of 0.018 mag .",
    "in  [ stellarmass ] we derive structural parameters from the surface photometry and discuss the use of the color gradient to estimate possible variations in stellar @xmath42 with projected radius .",
    "the primary spectroscopic data consist of four 40 minute exposures of the galaxy , flanked by five 40 minute offset - sky exposures ( taken before and after the on - galaxy exposures ) .",
    "we used the @xmath65 wide long - slit with the 600 grooves mm@xmath35 grating , blazed at 5000 .",
    "the spectral coverage extends from 3800  to 6400 .",
    "the resolution of 7  fwhm is equivalent to @xmath66 km / s , as shown in figure [ resol ] , more than adequate to resolve the velocity dispersions in the cd and its halo . while the spectral coverage is suitable for deriving absorption line velocity dispersions from several features , _",
    "e.g. , _ the mg b , g - band , or ca h & k , we concentrated our efforts around the g - band as a compromise between the desires to minimize contamination due to the sky background and to achieve adequate signal - to - noise ratios .    to maximize the extent of the halo observed and still preserve radial profile information for ngc 6166",
    ", we placed one end of the long - slit at the galaxy center and the rest of the @xmath32 long - slit north - east along the major axis at a position angle of 33 degrees ( see figure [ finder ] .",
    "our imaging of ngc 6166 on the same night confirms this angle as that of the major axis to within a degree . a second position , at the same position angle but centered on the galaxy nucleus , was also obtained in 1400 sec of integration time .    because ngc 6166 fills the entire length of a long - slit placed long the major - axis , we obtained alternating sky pointings offset from the galaxy , similar to the approach used by dressler ( 1979 ) , to facilitate accurate removal of the sky background . in principle , obtaining the sky spectrum at the same position on the detector as the galaxy spectra should minimize the effects of imperfect flat fielding , errors in rectification , and uncertainties in interpolating the sky background from the slit ends .",
    "while sembach & tonry ( 1996 ) used charge shuffling and chopping of the telescope on 5 min timescales in order to ensure that the offset - sky spectra were obtained at precisely the same physical pixel locations as the galaxy spectra , lris can not be used exactly in this mode .",
    "therefore we chose to nod between galaxy and sky on 40 min intervals , having to read out the detector at each position / exposure .",
    "our exposure times were chosen as a compromise between ( 1 ) requiring the data in the low - surface brightness halo of the cd to be limited by the noise in the sky background and not by the read noise in the electronics , and ( 2 ) avoiding the time - variability of the background . despite the variability of the sky spectrum , and the flexure characteristics of the instrument",
    ", we were able to obtain quality halo spectra where the surface brightness of the galaxy is approximately 6% of sky ( see below ) .",
    "we used the software package expector @xcite to rectify and wavelength - calibrate the lris spectroscopic data . a combination of hg , kr , ne , and ar lamps allowed us to rectify the spectra and to derive the high order terms for the wavelength calibration .",
    "the @xmath53 scatter about the dispersion solution of the lamp spectra was 0.04  ( 3  at the g band ) .",
    "the zero - points of the dispersion solutions of the galaxy spectra were refined using several high @xmath12 sky emission lines ( e.g. , 5224 , 5238 , 5577 , 6300 ) , resulting in a final @xmath53 scatter of 0.6  ( @xmath67 at the g - band ) .",
    "this large residual scatter about the sky lines is typical for lris data largely because the lines in lamp spectra are asymmetric compared with the sky emission lines .",
    "the asymmetries in the line profiles systematically vary with position across the ccd causing small systematic errors in the measurements of the line centers , and thus introduce a bias in the wavelength scale @xcite .",
    "these large residuals appear as a moderate - order deviation from the lamp line dispersion solution and may be reduced with further work if one intends to utilize a very long spectral baseline ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if the direct fitting of broadened templates to the galaxy spectrum is performed over a relatively short wavelength range , then a moderate @xmath53 in the dispersion solution manifests itself primarily as a zero - point error , and secondarily as a much smaller effective @xmath53 scatter in a local dispersion solution . for our data and fitting range ,",
    "the effective scatter is smaller by a factor of four ( to @xmath68 ) , and thus has a negligibly small impact on the measured velocity dispersions .      by obtaining full 2d sky spectra at offset positions from the cd , before and after each galaxy exposure",
    ", one should , in principle , be able to reconstruct the sky background at the time of the galaxy exposures .",
    "we modeled the temporal variability in the sky by fitting low - order polynomials to the sky values at each pixel , as functions of time and/or airmass .",
    "this method should have produced the expected 2d spectra of the sky background at the time and/or airmass of the galaxy observations , but such simple algorithms and interpolations did not allow for sufficiently accurate subtraction of the variable sky spectrum ( even in the blue ; see figure [ skyspec ] .",
    "we improved the background subtraction by fitting each ccd row in the on - galaxy 2d exposures using equation 8 of @xcite , originally suggested for measuring velocity dispersions from data from which the background has not been subtracted . by doing so , each ccd row in the data was fit as a sum of ( 1 ) the high signal - to - noise sky spectrum ( from the offset sky - exposures in the same ccd row ) , ( 2 ) a broadened velocity dispersion template , and ( 3 ) the low - order continuum functions .",
    "thus , the data were represented by a sum of the galaxy s contribution with the spectrum of the night sky , scaled by and offset by low - amplitude and low - order polynomials .",
    "this polynomial , equivalent to @xmath69 errors in the sky determination , effectively removes the time - variability of the sky background and any instabilities in the instrument .",
    "additional broadening of the sky spectrum did not improve @xmath70 so we infer that focus variabilities were negligible .",
    "construction of the background in this way provides a high signal - to - noise map of the contribution of the sky spectrum to the data within each row . at large galactic radii , where the galaxy contributes very little flux ,",
    "this construction of the row - to - row map of the background produces a noisy row - to - row map of galaxy flux .",
    "therefore , the 2d map of the sky contribution was fit by a low order polynomial in each wavelength bin and this spatially smoothed map of the sky background was used to perform the background subtraction .",
    "based on the analysis in  [ montecarlo ] ,",
    "in which we discuss the robustness of the @xmath41 measurements , our results are not sensitive to any remaining uncertainties in the background subtraction .",
    "spectra were summed along the spatial direction of the ccd in order to produce 1d spectra with adequate signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath71 per  ) for determination of velocity dispersions .",
    "figure [ finder ] illustrates the positions of the end - points of the spatial bins using short solid lines perpendicular to the length of the slit . in figure [ spectra ]",
    "we show the total sky@xmath72galaxy spectra from the deep spectroscopic integrations of the cd halo in four representative bins along the major - axis .",
    "the corresponding sky - subtracted galaxy spectra are shown in the right - hand panels of figure [ spectra ] .",
    "the data have not been flux - calibrated .",
    "in constructing mass models for ngc 6166 , the density profile of the stellar mass component is constrained by the observed surface brightness profile .",
    "the surface brightness profile only constrains the shape of the stellar luminosity density profile ; the stellar @xmath42 ratio ( @xmath73 ) can only be constrained by the kinematics .",
    "traditionally , photometry from a single bandpass is used , with the assumption of a spatially invariant @xmath73 .",
    "however , galaxies have gradients in their stellar populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "fortunately , we have surface photometry in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and in this section we combine the @xmath58 color gradient from  [ colorgrad ] with simple stellar population synthesis models to estimate the gradients in the @xmath39-band @xmath73 ratio ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath40-band @xmath73 ratio ( @xmath75 ) .    while the nature of the color gradient ( as a spatial variation in stellar ages and/or in stellar chemical abundances ) remains uncertain , we can make some simple assumptions to test to what extent the gradient in the stellar mass - to - light ratio will affect our conclusions about the profile of gravitational mass in the system .",
    "we explore _ three _ extreme cases : ( 1 ) no gradient in the properties of the stellar population ; ( 2 ) a gradient in [ fe / h ] ; and ( 3 ) a gradient in stellar ages . using the vazdekis  ( 1996 ) models , we have derived the correlation of @xmath76 color with @xmath74 and @xmath75 at fixed age or at fixed metallicity : @xmath77 and @xmath78 } } & = 2.00 \\delta ( b - r)\\cr \\delta \\log",

    "we hope to derive ( presumably ) more accurate representations of the stellar mass density profile ( though the results would still be dependent on the assumption of the age- or metallicity - dependence of the color gradient ) .    in table [",
    "tab : struct ] we list the parameters of the best - fit de vaucouleurs , king ( 1966 ) , and power - law profiles , under the three extreme assumptions about the gradient in the stellar populations ( the power - law profile is assumed to be of the form : @xmath79^\\gamma$ ] ) .",
    "all three parameterizations fit the data well , with  residuals between 0.03 and 0.07 mag .    when fitting the model profiles to the uncorrected @xmath39- and @xmath40-band surface brightness profiles , one obtains smaller effective and core radii in the redder bandpass , consistent with the stellar populations becoming bluer with increasing radius .",
    "when the @xmath39- and @xmath40-band surface brightness profiles are corrected , the resulting structural parameters from the two bandpasses are essentially identical .",
    "because we have divided our observed surface brightness profiles by the gradients in @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the corrected surface density profiles should more accurately reflect the stellar mass density profile ( modulo the normalization by a constant ) .    as an aside , there are large differences in the values of @xmath80 obtained from the uncorrected , age - variation - corrected , and metallicity - variation - corrected profiles . in the case where the stellar population gradient of ngc 6166 ( and presumably of other giant ellipticals ) is due solely to gradients in the chemical abundances ,",
    "the deduced half - mass radius is smaller than the @xmath39- and @xmath40-band half - light radii by 45% and 30% , respectively .",
    "such large systematic errors in the half - mass radii of elliptical galaxies may have a grave impact on early - type galaxy scaling relations , such as the fundamental plane @xcite , through the strongly correlated errors in @xmath80 and @xmath81 and the modest scatter in the color gradients of ellipticals and s0s ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . for the work presented here",
    ", we do not utilize the half - light or half - mass radii , so we offer this short discussion simply as a cautionary note .",
    "now that we are free from the assumption of a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio , we can explore to what extent the stellar mass may or may not be sufficient to support the motions of the stars through the cd halo .",
    "spectra for the galaxy were extracted from the radial bins defined in figure [ finder ] .",
    "four represenative spectra are shown in the right - hand panels of figure [ spectra ] . in each of the radial bins , @xmath82 per  , with the @xmath12 reaching 120 per   inside 15 kpc . with such @xmath12 ratios ,",
    "the data are quite suitable for measuring the internal motions of the stars in ngc 6166 and its halo out to 60 kpc . to simplify the derivation of the internal kinematics , we parameterize the losvd as a gaussian . in the inner regions the high @xmath12 ratios",
    "would normally have allowed us to measure the higher - order moments @xmath83 or @xmath84 of the losvd @xcite .",
    "unfortunately ( see below ) , an interloping object with a velocity shift of 1300 km / s from ngc 6166 contaminates its spectrum between 4 kpc @xmath85 12 kpc . as a result the losvds for both objects were modeled by pure gaussians , with both components being fit simultaneously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at large radii in the cd halo , where accurate determinations of @xmath83 or @xmath84 would also be useful for constraints on the anisotropy ,",
    "the @xmath12 ratios are not sufficient .",

    "once the instrumental broadening had been characterized as a function of wavelength and position along the ccd , the template spectra from the literature were broadened to match the instrumental resolution of the galaxy spectra . while we relied primarily on the templates from the literature to derive the internal kinematics , the template spectra obtained during the run were useful to verify the robustness of our measurements .",
    "the velocity dispersions derived using the templates observed during the run agreed with velocity dispersions derived using the templates from the literature at the level of 0.5% .",
    "the quality of the fits to the galaxy spectra can be seen in the right - hand panels of figure [ spectra ] . while the interloper is clearly visible in two of the examples in the figure , the contamination was easily removed by the fitting procedures and the residuals of the fits show no remaining systematic effects .",

    "the open points ( circles and squares ) show the data from the shallow central pointing ; the open circles are from the same side of the galaxy as the deep pointing , and the open squares were derived from the opposite side of the galaxy .",
    "the agreement of @xmath44 from both sides of the galaxy is excellent and indicates that the interloping galaxy was successfully removed during the fitting of the deep spectroscopy .",

    "the most extreme cases of active dark matter produce flat ( @xmath22 ) halo cores , but some fine - tuning of the dark matter interaction cross section may be required to avoid creating a universe of perfectly spherical halos @xcite .",
    "perhaps the discrepancy will be resolved with @xmath20 being a function of scale @xcite ; though see @xcite .",
    "for the moment , the simulations are difficult to interpret . not only is the scatter in @xmath20 poorly known , but the quoted values of @xmath20 have been derived by fitting the halo profiles outside @xmath181 kpc ! ] @xcite , and the consequences of the implied extrapolation of the parameterized models to @xmath182 are ignored .",
    "taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) argue that the phase - space density profiles of dark matter halos are well - approximated by power - laws over @xmath183 , and those authors extrapolate the power - law phase - space density profile to @xmath23 to obtain @xmath184 . including the effects of baryons will likely be important on these scales as the cooling of baryonic matter will result in adiabatic contraction @xcite , which steepens the inner profile of the halo @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the transfer of angular momentum from the baryons to the dark matter can soften the cores of halos @xcite .",
    "furthermore , weinberg ( 2001 ) suggests a number of dynamical processes that can drive the cores of dark matter halos towards @xmath185 .",
    "future simulations will hopefully resolve these problems either ( 1 ) by using more physically motivated boundary conditions in the extrapolation to @xmath182 ( cf .",
    "* ) , or ( 2 ) by resolving the physics within @xmath186 . because weinberg ( 2001 ) and nusser & sheth ( 1999 ) suggest that the inner profiles of dark matter halos may be sensitive to their initial conditions and histories of collapse and merging , the simulations should ultimately ( 1 ) predict the cosmic scatter in @xmath20 ( at a given halo mass ) , and ( 2 ) provide the means to estimate the timescales of formation for dark matter halos of a given mass and @xmath20 ( instead of using the concentration parameter ; * ? ? ?",
    "we use the stellar kinematics of ngc 6166 and its halo to probe the mass distribution in the core of the rich cluster abell 2199 . the projected velocity dispersion along the major - axis of ngc 6166 rises steeply with radius beyond the projected radius @xmath187 kpc ( where @xmath188 mag / arcsec@xmath49 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion profile decreases from about 300  at @xmath189 kpc to 200  at @xmath190 kpc ( recall , the seeing was @xmath130 fwhm @xmath191 kpc ) , remains flat to @xmath187 kpc , and then steadily rises to @xmath192 at @xmath193 kpc ( where @xmath194 mag / arcsec@xmath49 ) , nearly reaching the velocity dispersion of the cluster ( @xmath195 ) .",
    "there is also evidence for mild rotation in intracluster stars beyond @xmath154 kpc ( @xmath196 ) , which is not seen in the kinematics of the cluster members .",
    "because we measure the velocity dispersion gradient with high precision , we have constrained the mass profiles of both the stellar and dark matter distributions , under the assumptions of isotropy and spherical symmetry .",

    "we also derived tangential critical radii for our two - component mass models assuming abell 2199 were placed at cosmological redshifts .",
    "the predicted tangential critical radii are consistent with the radii of arcs in strong lensing clusters at intermediate redshift .",
    "our results obtained for abell 2199 have strong implications for the study of dark matter halo profiles .",
    "the best - fit models are inconsistent with the predictions of @xmath8-body simulations of cold dark matter .",

    "* ) and to predict the scatter in @xmath20 .",
    "observationally , we are obtaining kinematical information for additional cd galaxies with the goal of providing empirical constraints on the scatter in dark matter halo properties .    with the possibility of observing cd galaxies to large radii using very long ( @xmath199 ) slits , the task of background subtraction will become easier and more accurate . using a large database of cd galaxy kinematics , with several long - slit position angles per galaxy",
    ", we can explore more complicated models , in which both intrinsic flattening and anisotropy are included . at the same time , the expansion of catalogs of cluster galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dramatic increases in the spatial resolution of @xmath200-ray data , will enable us to better constrain the inner and outer slopes of dark matter halo profiles , while allowing us to avoid many of the simplifying assumptions .",
