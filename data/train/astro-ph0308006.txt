    "gas much cooler than the virial temperature is also seen in clusters .",

    "later , baade & minkowski ( 1954 ) noted that ngc  1275 was unusual among seyfert galaxies because its emission lines were not restricted to the nuclear regions .",

    "the goings - on in the cores of these clusters certainly qualify as an important astrophysical puzzle that may have far reaching implications for galaxy formation .",

    "cosmological models for cluster formation that do not include cooling are clearly too simplistic because they do not spawn galaxies .",
    "radiative cooling initiates galaxy birth but is responsible for the now - classic overcooling problem ( white & rees 1978 ; cole 1991 ) .",
    "if no form of feedback opposes cooling , then at least 20% of the baryons in the universe , and maybe more , should have condensed into stars . yet , the observed fraction of baryons in stars is @xmath65% ( see fig .  [ fig - condfrac ] ; balogh et al .",
    "this overcooling problem is even more acute in clusters , where primordial densities are higher , enabling even more of the baryons to condense .",
    "one could also call this problem the `` theoretical cooling flow problem '' because far too many baryons cool and condense if there is no heat source to compensate for radiative cooling .",
    "supernova feedback is generally assumed to provide the requisite heat to halt overcooling in galaxies , although the precise mechanism remains murky ( e.g. , kay 2002 ) .",
    "however , supernovae might not provide enough heat to halt overcooling in clusters , where the binding energy per particle exceeds the mean supernova energy per particle ( @xmath66  kev ) , as measured from the intracluster metallicity ( e.g. , finoguenov , arnaud , & david 2001 ) .",
    "thus , feedback from agns may be necessary to suppress cluster cooling flows .",
    "the slope of the observed @xmath60-@xmath61 relation has long been assumed to reflect an early episode of feedback that imposed a universal entropy floor throughout the intergalactic medium ( evrard & henry 1991 ; kaiser 1991 ) .",
    "an entropy floor steepens the @xmath60-@xmath61 relation from @xmath67 to @xmath60  @xmath63 because the extra entropy stiffens the intracluster medium against compression .",
    "lower temperature clusters with shallower potential wells therefore have a harder time compressing their core gas , leading to lower core densities and smaller x - ray luminosities than expected in models without cooling and feedback .",
    "measurements of intracluster entropy in the vicinity of the x - ray core radius support this notion because they indicate elevated entropy levels in groups and poor clusters , corresponding to @xmath68 ( ponman et al .",
    "1999 ; lloyd - davies , ponman , & cannon 2000 ) . in order to produce such an entropy floor through supernova heating alone ,",
    "a large proportion of the available supernova energy is needed ( kravtsov & yepes 2000 ) .",
    "even then , the required supernova heating efficiency may be unrealistic , in which case additional heat input from agns would be required ( valageas & silk 1999 ; wu , fabian , & nulsen 2000 ) .",
    "however , there is another way to interpret these entropy measurements that does not involve global heating of the intergalactic medium .    instead",
    ", the @xmath60-@xmath61 relation may reflect a conspiracy between cooling and feedback that regulates the core entropy of clusters and groups ( voit & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "figure  [ ent_core ] shows measurements of core entropy from ponman , sanderson , & finoguenov ( 2003 ) along with the locus in @xmath34-@xmath69 space at which the cooling time equals a hubble time .",
    "the way in which core entropy tracks this locus suggests that gas with a short cooling time is eliminated from clusters by a combination of cooling and feedback .",
    "a parcel of gas with entropy ( @xmath69 ) below this threshold must condense unless feedback intervenes .",
    "if feedback is effective , then it will raise the entropy of the gas parcel until it exceeds the threshold , where it is no longer subject to cooling .",
    "if feedback is ineffective , then most of the parcel s gas will cool and condense . either way , both cooling and feedback remove gas from the region below the threshold , establishing a core entropy at the level of the threshold .",
    "this mechanism explains why simulations that include cooling produce clusters with reasonably realistic @xmath60-@xmath61 and @xmath64-@xmath61 relations , regardless of the efficiency of feedback ( muanwong 2001 ; borgani 2002 ; dav , katz , & weinberg 2002 ) .",
    "however , the amount of baryons that end up in galaxies is very sensitive to how feedback is implemented ( kay , thomas , & theuns 2003 ) .",
    "thus , it would appear that cooling is essential to a proper understanding of cluster properties and that the details of how cooling flows are suppressed are crucial to understanding hierarchical galaxy formation in the context of clusters .",
    "many cooling flow clusters also contain radio sources indicative of recent nuclear activity ( e.g. , burns 1990 ) .",
    "this close association between agns and clusters with short central cooling times supports the idea that feedback from agns helps to suppress cooling .",
    "some authors have proposed that radiation from the active nucleus heats the cluster core ( e.g. , ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ) , but far more attention has been paid to the possibility that radio jets somehow heat the intracluster medium ( e.g. , binney & tabor 1995 ; churazov 2001 ; soker 2001 ; brggen & kaiser 2002 ; reynolds , heinz , & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "such heating was originally not considered to be a viable solution to the mass - sink problem because the total amount of energy needed to stabilize a strong cooling flow is quite large ( @xmath70  erg ) , and the spatial deposition of that heat would need to be precisely matched to local cooling rates in order to maintain thermal stability ( fabian 1994 ) . however , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations showing widespread interactions between radio plasma and the intracluster medium ( e.g. , fabian 2000 ; mcnamara 2000 ) have stimulated new interest in connections between radio jets and cooling flows .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ observations reveals that jets do not simply shock - heat the surrounding intracluster medium , because the gas surrounding the lobes appears somewhat cooler and denser than the undisturbed gas farther from the lobes ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus , because cluster cores do not appear to be shock heated , most of the recent theoretical models have focused on mixing and turbulent heating stirred up as the buoyant radio plasma rises through the intracluster medium ( e.g. , quilis , bower , & balogh 2001 ; brggen & kaiser 2002 ; reynolds et al .",
    "both mixing and heating raise the entropy of the core gas , consequently raising its cooling time as well .",
    "these models circumvent the local fine - tuning problem by distributing heat over a large region through convection , and they add additional thermal energy to the core beyond that supplied by the agn itself by mixing the core gas with overlying gas of higher entropy",
    ".    however , not all clusters with short central cooling times have obvious nuclear activity .",
    "thus , if agn heating is the solution to the cooling flow puzzle , then it must be episodic .",
    "a recent model by kaiser & binney ( 2003 ) shows how the central entropy profile would evolve under episodic heating .",
    "because cooling rates rise dramatically as isobaric gas cools to lower temperatures , an episodically heated medium usually contains very little gas below @xmath57 .",
    "when the central gas reaches this temperature it is assumed to cool very quickly to even cooler temperatures and accrete onto the agn , triggering another episode of heating .",
    "this feature of episodic heating may explain the absence of line emission from colder gas in cool core clusters .      during the first two decades of the cooling flow hypothesis ,",
    "the idea that electron thermal conduction might somehow suppress cooling was a minority viewpoint , despite the fact that it has many attractive features .",
    "because conduction carries heat from warmer regions to cooler regions , it naturally directs thermal energy into regions that would otherwise condense .",
    "also , it taps the vast reservoir of thermal energy in the intracluster medium surrounding the cluster core , which is more than sufficient to resupply the radiated energy .",
    "many models invoking conduction have been developed ( e.g. , tucker & rosner 1983 ; bertschinger & meiksin 1986 ; bregman & david 1988 ; rosner & tucker 1989 ; sparks 1992 ) , but conduction has often been dismissed as a global solution on the grounds that it is not stable enough to preserve the observed temperature and density gradients for periods of order @xmath71  gyr ( cowie & binney 1977 ; fabian 1994 ) . the heat flux from unsaturated conduction proceeding uninhibited by magnetic fields",
    "is @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , the so - called spitzer rate ( spitzer 1962 ) .",
    "because of this extreme sensitivity to temperature , it is difficult for radiative cooling and conduction to achieve precise thermal balance with a globally stable temperature gradient ( bregman & david 1988 ; soker 2003 ) .",
    "however , any mechanism that places cool gas at the center of a cluster , such as a merger of a gas - rich galaxy with the central cluster galaxy , sets up a temperature gradient that would cause uninhibited conduction to proceed until either the cool gas has evaporated or the hot gas has condensed ( sparks 1989 ) . as long as a temperature gradient exists",
    ", a certain amount of conduction has to occur .    in order for a standard , steady cooling flow alone to produce the temperature gradients observed in cool core clusters ,",
    "conduction must be highly suppressed by at least 2 orders of magnitude below the spitzer rate , presumably by tangled magnetic fields ( binney & cowie 1981 ; fabian 1991 ) . yet , recent theoretical analyses of conduction have concluded that this level of suppression is unrealistically high ( malyshkin 2001 ; malyshkin & kulsrud 2001 ; narayan & medvedev 2001 ) .",
    "these studies suggest that magnetic field tangling may only suppress conduction by a factor @xmath6310 , implying that it may be important in the cores of clusters .",
    "this finding , coupled with the x - ray spectroscopic observations showing little evidence for cooling gas , has helped to spur a remarkable revival of the idea of conduction , with notable assistance from some of its harshest earlier critics ( fabian et al .",
    "2002 ; voigt 2002 ; zakamska & narayan 2003 ; but see loeb 2002 ) .",
    "one can analyze the observed temperature gradients of clusters by defining an effective conduction coefficient @xmath74 that would lead to balance between radiative cooling and conductive heating .",
    "the values of @xmath75 measured at @xmath45  kpc in cool core clusters are typically @xmath76 , suggesting that electron thermal conduction is a plausible mechanism for counteracting radiative cooling over much of the region where @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig - kappaeff ] ) .    even though conduction may be important at @xmath45  kpc , the required effective conductivity exceeds the spitzer rate at radii @xmath77  kpc ( ruszkowski & begelman 2002 ; voigt 2002 ) , a result presaged by the analysis of bertschinger & meiksin ( 1986 ) .",
    "thus , a modest amount of feedback may be necessary to offset cooling in the centers of cool core clusters .",
    "hybrid models involving conduction in the outer parts of the core and agn feedback in the inner parts have been developed by ruszkowski & begelman ( 2002 ) and brighenti & mathews ( 2003 ) .",
    "observations from the present generation of x - ray telescopes have dethroned the cooling flow hypothesis , but what will take its place ?",
    "star formation , radio jets , and conduction may all have important roles to play in the development of cluster cores .",
    "conduction is notoriously hard to test because the rate at which it proceeds depends on the unknown geometry of intracluster magnetic fields and uncertain factor by which these fields suppress heat flow . looking for hallmarks of episodic feedback , from both agns and supernovae ,",
    "may be more fruitful , at least in the short term .",
    "if feedback is episodic , then the state of the central intracluster medium should be closely related to other goings - on in the cluster core .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to test whether the @xmath57 scaling of the minimum plasma temperature apparent in the early sample of _ xmm - newton _ clusters from peterson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) holds for a large sample of cool core clusters with various levels of core activity . how do the x - ray emission - line spectra of clusters with radio - loud nuclei differ from those of clusters with radio - quiet nuclei ?",
    "are there any correlations between x - ray line emission and the presence of obvious star formation or emission - line nebulae ?",
    "episodic heating also leads to a predictable pattern in the evolution of the core entropy distribution ( kaiser & binney 2003 ) .",
    "thus , studying the core entropy distributions of a large sample of clusters may reveal a telltale pattern of entropy evolution with time .    in order to look for evidence of a feedback duty cycle in cluster cores and to study how their properties depend on agn and star formation activity",
    ", we are now in the midst of an archival _ chandra _ study of cluster cores .",
    "the result of this program will be a publicly available library of entropy distributions showing how the entropy of intracluster gas depends on radius and enclosed gas mass within that radius ( horner et al .",
    ", in preparation . )",
    "we are focusing on entropy because it is the thermodynamic quantity most closely related to heat input and radiative cooling .",
    "we invite all who are interested in the vexing problem of cooling flows to take advantage of this database .",
