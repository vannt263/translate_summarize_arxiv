    "the cluster formation is not only an essential degree of freedom in light nuclei but also remains important in light hypernuclei .",
    "while microscopic and semi - microscopic cluster model calculations have a long history in the study of ordinary nuclei  @xcite , they have also played an important role in studying hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "in fact , since 1970 s , together with the experimental situation , where @xmath12 hypernuclear - production reaction data was made available  @xcite , the spectroscopic properties of @xmath13-shell hypernuclei have been intensively investigated  @xcite by using the cluster models such as generator coordinate method ( gcm )  @xcite and orthogonality condition model ( ocm )  @xcite .",
    "they have revealed novel properties in light hypernuclei .",
    "in particular , a `` glue - like '' role of the @xmath0 particle and the subsequent core - shrinkage effect have been widely discussed in @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of @xmath21 value , due to the effect , was predicted theoretically  @xcite , which was later on confirmed by experiment in @xmath15  @xcite . as a typical example of cluster states ,",
    "many authors investigated @xmath17 hypernucleus by using the gcm and ocm  @xcite .",
    "they showed the rotational spectrum composed of the @xmath10 clusters , in an analogy to the case of @xmath22 , and the advent of unique state called the genuinely hypernuclear state  @xcite or the supersymmetric state  @xcite .",
    "the importance of the clustering aspect in @xmath17 was also confirmed quantitatively in comparison with the experimental data of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 reactions  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in ordinary light nuclei , a very promising model wave function is proposed to describe cluster states .",
    "that is the so - called tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( thsr ) wave function  @xcite , which was originally introduced to investigate the @xmath26 condensate states with a dilute gaslike configuration of a few number of @xmath26 particles  @xcite .",
    "the wave function is now known to be the best wave function to describe such the special cluster structure realized in @xmath22 and the hoyle state ( the second @xmath27 state at @xmath28 mev of @xmath29 ) . for both cases the resonating group method ( rgm )",
    "wave function  @xcite , which was obtained in the full model space with respect to the @xmath26-@xmath26 relative motions , is almost @xmath30 % equivalent to a single and energetically optimal configuration of the thsr wave function with the condensate character  @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "non - gaslike cluster states have been recognized as having localized structures of clusters , which are obviously quite different from the @xmath26 condensate states mentioned above .",
    "the inversion doublet band states of @xmath31 in @xmath32  @xcite , linear - chain structures of @xmath33 and @xmath34 particles  @xcite , etc .",
    "are such typical examples .",
    "nevertheless recent calculations clarified that all those structure states can also be expressed by the single configurations of the thsr wave function with nearly @xmath30 % accuracy  @xcite .",
    "this is amazing since the thsr wave function has always been considered to provide a nonlocalization picture based on a container structure by its functional form and to be specialized in describing the gaslike cluster states .",
    "these results therefore urge us to reexamine our conventional picture about the localized cluster structures .",
    "it is then interesting to see how much the container picture works well for cluster states in hypernuclei , since additional @xmath0 particle is known to make spatial core shrinkage and thus seems to realize more localized cluster structure .",
    "the purpose of this study is to introduce a thsr - type model wave function in @xmath0 hypernuclei , as the hyper - thsr wave function , and to apply it to @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of spatial core shrinkage , which will be invoked by the additional @xmath0 particle , is expected to be properly taken into account by the hyper - thsr wave function , since the only parameter in the wave function is what specifies monopole - like dilatation of a whole nucleus .",
    "we first perform the full microscopic @xmath35 cluster model calculation based on the @xmath36 brink model wave function and gcm  @xcite .",
    "we then compare the full solution with the single hyper - thsr wave function and discuss the container structure of the @xmath10 and @xmath0 clusters .",
    "we also discuss the intrinsic density of @xmath17 and demonstrate the structural change from @xmath22 to @xmath17 , in which the roles of @xmath0 particle and pauli principle to give the spatial localization of the @xmath10 clusters is emphasized . this paper is organized as follows : in   [ hyp_thsr ] we extend the deformed thsr wave function to the hyper - thsr wave function so as to apply to @xmath37 system .",
    "we then outline the @xmath36 brink wave function and gcm in   [ brink_gcm ] , and microscopic hamiltonian we adopt , in   [ haml ] . in ",
    "[ result ] , we compare the @xmath36 hyper - thsr wave function with the brink - gcm wave function .",
    "we also discuss the effect of the @xmath0 particle injected to the @xmath22 core , and the change of the intrinsic structures .",
    "  [ summary ] is devoted to summary .",
    "we propose a new - type microscopic cluster model wave function , which we refer to as the hyper - thsr wave function .",
    "this is based on the deformed @xmath38 thsr wave function in a @xmath39-nucleus  @xcite , which is characterized by two kinds of size parameters , one for the @xmath26 particle and the other for the center - of - mass motions of the @xmath26 particles .",
    "the former is denoted as @xmath40 and the latter as @xmath41 @xmath42 , with deformation being taken into account .",
    "the explicit form of the thsr wave function is shown as follows : @xmath43 \\phi(\\alpha_i ) \\big\\ } ,    \\label{eq : thsr}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 is the internal wave function of the @xmath45-th @xmath26 particle , with @xmath46 shell - model configuration , @xmath47 .",
    "\\label{eq : int_alpha}\\ ] ] here @xmath48 denotes the center - of - mass coordinate of the @xmath45-th @xmath26 particle , and the spurious total center - of - mass motion , which is concerned with the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath49 , is exactly eliminated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thsr ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath50 antisymmetrizes all the @xmath39 nucleons , and therefore , when @xmath51 , the normalized thsr wave function coincides with the shell model slater determinant . on the contrary , so far as @xmath52 is large enough to be able to neglect the effect of the antisymmetrizer @xmath50 , all @xmath26 clusters occupy an identical deformed orbit , @xmath53 @xmath54 $ ] , with respect to the @xmath26 particle s center - of - mass motions measured from the total center - of - mass position .",
    "this displays a product arrangement of the @xmath55 particles , and hence is referred to as the @xmath38 condensed state  @xcite . in all the subsequent calculations , however , from a technical reason , we parametrize the thsr wave function by @xmath56 @xmath42 and @xmath40 , instead of @xmath41 and @xmath40 , following the relation @xmath57 @xmath42 . of course",
    ", this does not change any picture of this model wave function mentioned above .",
    "we should repeat that the thsr wave function provides a structure that the @xmath26 clusters are confined in a container , whose size is characterized by the variational parameter @xmath58 , in a nonlocalized way , and occupy an identical orbit of a self - consistent mean - field potential of the clusters , under the effect of the antisymmetrization .",
    "this is very different from the conventional cluster model wave function , like the brink model wave function  @xcite , in which relative motions of clusters are characterized by inter - cluster distance parameters , in a localized way . as mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , the thsr wave function , however , very nicely describes not only the loosely bound @xmath26 cluster states such as @xmath11 and the hoyle state , but also rather compact cluster states like the @xmath59 inversion doublet band states and @xmath26-linear - chain states with practically @xmath30 % accuracy , although the latters had been considered to have the localized cluster structures .",
    "even the ground state of @xmath29 is also shown to be described very precisely by the single thsr wave function with a proper choice of @xmath58 value  @xcite .",
    "all these imply that the parameter @xmath58 plays a role of dynamical coordinate specifying a monopole - like dilatation of whole system , to describe compact cluster states to dilute cluster states in a unified way .",
    "the hyper - thsr wave function describing the @xmath60 hypernucleus with good angular momentum is then introduced as follows : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the angular - momentum projection operator and the @xmath0 particle simply couples to the @xmath10 core nucleus in an @xmath63 wave .",
    "its radial part is expanded in terms of gaussian basis functions , @xmath64 with respect to the width parameter @xmath65 , where @xmath66 . in the practical calculations , we assume an axially - symmetric deformation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : thsr ] ) , @xmath67 and fix the parameter @xmath68 fm in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int_alpha ] ) , which is the same value as adopted in ref .  @xcite and almost the same as the size of the @xmath26 particle in free space .",
    "note that the hyper - thsr wave function , eq .  ( [ eq : hypthsr ] ) , has positive intrinsic parity .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion @xmath69 are then determined by solving the following hill - wheeler - type equation of motion  @xcite , @xmath70 this hyper - thsr wave function is characterized only by the parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which correspond to a spatial extension of the whole nucleus .",
    "it is reported that the @xmath0 particle invokes spatial core shrinkage in many hypernuclei .",
    "it should be mentioned that such a core shrinkage effect is expected to be taken into account very naturally by this parametrization of @xmath58 , in general hypernuclei , since it specifies the dilatation of the whole nucleus . in the present work ,",
    "only the @xmath63-wave component of the @xmath0 particle is considered , for simplicity .",
    "thus the monopole - like shrinkage is expected to be described nicely by this wave function .",
    "the extension to inclusion of the other angular - momentum channels is of course possible and left as a future work .",
    "we briefly mention here the conventional microscopic @xmath60 cluster model , which is brink - gcm wave function and is used to compare with the hyper - thsr wave function in the subsequent sections .",
    "the @xmath1 brink - gcm wave function is based on the following brink cluster model wave functions , @xmath73,\\ ] ] for the @xmath10 clusters and @xmath74 for the @xmath0 particle , where the jacobi coordinates and a mass ratio between nucleon @xmath75 and @xmath0-particle @xmath76 are defined by @xmath77 and @xmath66 , and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "these brink wave functions elucidate the localized clustering , where the @xmath26 clusters and @xmath0 particle are localized around a separation distance @xmath79 for @xmath26-@xmath26 part and @xmath63 for @xmath0-@xmath22 part , respectively , with a rather small width parameter @xmath80 .",
    "the brink - gcm wave function can then be described by a superposition of these localized cluster wave functions , with discretized values for the radial parts of the separation - distance parameters @xmath79 and @xmath63 , as follows : @xmath81_j .",

    "the potential ja gives much closer @xmath0 binding energy of the ground state to the experimental value , @xmath114 mev , than the potential nd .",

    "we can see that for all the @xmath117 states the total wave functions are dominated practically only by the @xmath63-wave channel for the @xmath0 particle , i.e. @xmath118 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one of the reasons why this drastic shrinkage happens is that the @xmath0 particle is out of the antisymmetrization and can stay deeply inside the core nucleus to gain deeper binding energy .",
    "we then simulate the shrinkage effect by varying @xmath9 interaction artificially , with overall factor @xmath125 multiplied with @xmath126 in eq .",

    "is shortened along @xmath131-direction .",

    "( [ eq : ovlp ] ) with the use of the same artificial @xmath9 potential , rms radii of the @xmath11 core , etc , like in table  [ tab2 ] , are also shown in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "@xmath132 and @xmath133 correspond to the cases of @xmath22 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "starting from the case of @xmath22 with very large value of @xmath72 and small value of @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath135 fm and @xmath136 fm , only the @xmath72 value drastically gets smaller as the increase of @xmath9 interaction , and eventually for @xmath134 , @xmath72 becomes much smaller while @xmath71 is almost unchanged , i.e. @xmath137 fm and @xmath138 fm . in the case of @xmath127 the @xmath0 binding energy",
    "is very small @xmath139 mev and accordingly the rms distance of the @xmath0 particle from the core is very long , @xmath140 fm , since the @xmath0 particle can not be trapped into the coulomb barrier .",
    "as the increase of the @xmath0 binding energy , the distance @xmath141 gets shorter and the @xmath0 particle gets to localize around the core to gain the energy . at @xmath142 , where the @xmath9 interaction is strong enough ,",
    "since the @xmath0 particle is free from the antisymmetrizer , it can come in deeply inside the core , so that it causes the strong shrinkage of the core and the very compact object is realized .",
    "nevertheless , due to the strong effect of the antisymmetrization between nucleons , the core keeps very clear spatial localization of the @xmath10 clusters .",
    "we should note that at each step of the change of @xmath9 interaction , from dilute @xmath10 cluster structure to compact localized @xmath10 cluster structure , all are described precisely by single hyper - thsr wave functions , which have optimal sizes of deformed container , i.e. those with large - size container to small - size container .",
    "we should emphasize that at every step of @xmath125 , the squared overlaps with the full brink - gcm solutions are more than @xmath143% .",
    "this may imply that the thsr - type container picture is essentially important in understanding every type of cluster structures , from the compact to dilute ones .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , the thsr wave function does not only describe accurately the gaslike cluster states but also non - gaslike cluster states such as the inversion doublet bands of @xmath31 in @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 linear - chain states , etc .",
    "these states commonly retain the above mentioned nature of the container structure with the effective localization coming from the pauli principle .",
    "this is considered to be a key ingredient to understand nuclear cluster structures .",
    "the @xmath144 nucleus is one of the most compact objects with cluster structure and hence is quite different from @xmath22 with dilute @xmath10-cluster structure .",
    "thus the present result indicates that this picture is also indispensable to understand hypernuclear cluster structures , even in a high density limit of clustering , where the effect of the pauli principle on nucleons is too strong , due to the shrinkage effect of the @xmath0 particle which is free from the pauli principle and hence is not prevented from sitting deeply inside the core .",
    "this further implies that this concept might also play an important role in describing cluster structures in neutron - rich nuclei , since additional neutrons are also expected to play a glue - like role in core nuclei , although the neutrons are antisymmetrized with nucleons in core nuclei .",
    "we newly introduced the hyper - thsr wave function , which can be applied to hypernuclei and takes over the important feature of the original thsr wave function that the constituent clusters are confined into a container , whose size is the variational parameter @xmath58 , under the consideration of the effect of the antisymmetrization of nucleons .",
    "we investigated @xmath144 using this new cluster model wave function .",
    "we first performed the full @xmath1 brink - gcm calculation and compared the solutions for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 states with the corresponding hyper - thsr wave functions .",
    "the dominant components of the brink - gcm wave function are shown to be the ones from @xmath124 channel , where the @xmath0 particle couples to the core in an @xmath63-wave .",
    "we showed that the components of the @xmath63-wave channel of the @xmath0 particle are almost equivalent to the single configuration of the hyper - thsr wave function .",
    "the squared overlaps between them are @xmath3 % , @xmath4 % , and @xmath5 % for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 states , respectively , with the use of potential nd .",
    "we then discussed the intrinsic structure of the @xmath10 part in @xmath144 by using the intrinsic hyper - thsr wave function before the angular - momentum projection . the structural change by adding the @xmath0 particle is particularly demonstrated by artificially varying the @xmath9 interaction .",
    "as the increase of the @xmath9 interaction , the @xmath0 particle , which is free from the antisymmetrizer , gets to stay more deeply inside the core to gain larger @xmath0 binding energy , and causes the strong shrinkage of the core and makes it very compact object .",
    "however , the inter - cluster pauli repulsion , due to the antisymmetrization between the nucleons , is so strong that the clear @xmath10-cluster structure still survives . during the structural change of the core by varying the @xmath9 interaction ,",
    "the full solutions obtained by the brink - gcm calculations can be expressed by the single hyper - thsr wave functions , with more than @xmath143 % accuracy .",
    "these results mean that the above mentioned container structure inherent in the hyper - thsr wave function is exactly realized in @xmath17 , which is made very much compact by the additional @xmath0 particle , and hence not at all `` gaslike '' object like @xmath11 .",
    "these also indicate that the effect of spatial core shrinkage , invoked by the additional @xmath0 particle , is very nicely taken into account in the hyper - thsr wave function , in which the size parameter @xmath58 specifies the monopole - like dilatation of the whole nucleus .",
    "thus this hyper - thsr ansatz is very promising in studying cluster structures in hypernuclei .",
    "the application to heavier hypernuclei like @xmath18 will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the present hyper - thsr ansatz is very flexible .",
    "one way to push forward this container picture with inclusion of the angular - momentum channels other than the @xmath63-wave is to consider the deformation for the @xmath0-particle wave function as well .",
    "the extension to a coupled - channel approach is also not difficult , and they are left as future works .",

    "<S> new concept of clustering is discussed in @xmath0 hypernuclei using a new - type microscopic cluster model wave function , which has a structure that constituent clusters are confined in a container , whose size is a variational parameter and which we refer to as hyper - tohsaki - horiuchi - schuck - rpke ( hyper - thsr ) wave function . by using the hyper - thsr wave function , @xmath1 cluster structure in @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we show that full microscopic solutions in the @xmath1 cluster system , which are given as @xmath1 brink - gcm wave functions , are almost perfectly reproduced by the single configurations of the hyper - thsr wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the squared overlaps between the both wave functions are calculated to be @xmath3 % , @xmath4 % , and @xmath5 % for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also simulate the structural change by adding the @xmath0 particle , by varying the @xmath9 interaction artificially . </S>",
    "<S> as the increase of the @xmath9 interaction , the @xmath0 particle gets to move more deeply inside the core and invokes strongly the spatial core shrinkage , and accordingly distinct localized @xmath10 clusters appear in the nucleonic intrinsic density , though in @xmath11 rather gaslike @xmath10-cluster structure is shown . the origin of the localization is associated with the strong effect of pauli principle . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the container picture of the @xmath10 and @xmath0 clusters is essential in understanding the cluster structure in @xmath2 , in which the very compact spatial localization of clusters is shown in the density distribution . </S>"
