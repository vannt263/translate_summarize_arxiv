    "we will not give a thorough history of this topic , but it is important to recall some preliminary information .",
    "we depend heavily on the concept of a _ geometric graph _ , which was pioneered by kallay @xcite .",
    "he defined a geometric graph as any graph @xmath6 whose vertex set @xmath7 is a subset of a finite - dimensional real vector space @xmath8 , and whose edge set @xmath9 is a subset of the line segments joining members of @xmath7 .",
    "( of course , @xmath8 will be isomorphic to @xmath10 for some @xmath2 , but we prefer this basis - free formulation . ) it is largely a formality whether we consider an edge to be an unordered pair or a line segment .",
    "it is significant that such a graph need not be the edge graph of any polytope .",
    "he then extended the notion of decomposability to such graphs in the following manner .    for convenience ,",
    "let us say that a function @xmath11 is a _ decomposing function _ for the graph @xmath12 if it has the property that @xmath13 is a scalar multiple of @xmath14 for each edge @xmath15\\in e$ ] .",
    "( this is slightly different from kallay s _ local similarity _ ; he insisted on strictly positive multiples . ) a geometric graph @xmath16 is then called _ decomposable _ if there is a decomposing function which is neither constant , nor the restriction of a homothety on @xmath8 .",
    "if the only non - constant decomposing functions are homotheties then @xmath6 is called _",
    "indecomposable_.    significantly , kallay showed ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) that a polytope is indecomposable if and only if its edge graph is indecomposable in this sense .",
    "exploiting an idea of mcmullen @xcite and kallay ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1b ) , we showed in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 8) that it is even sufficient just to have an indecomposable subgraph which contains at least one vertex from every facet ( maximal face ) . a strategy for proving indecomposability of a polytope",
    "is thus to prove that certain simple geometric graphs are indecomposable , and by building up to show that the entire skeleton of our polytope is indecomposable .",
    "( it also would be interesting to formulate somehow a notion of _ primitivity _ for such graphs . )",
    "building on the concept introduced in @xcite , let us say that a geometric graph @xmath16 is a simple extension of a geometric graph @xmath17 if @xmath6 has one more vertex and two more edges than @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely , we mean that there is a unique @xmath19 , and distinct vertices @xmath20 and @xmath21 in @xmath22 , such that @xmath23\\}\\cup\\{[v , w]\\}$ ] .",
    "observe that the existence of these two edges means that the value of any decomposing function at @xmath24 is determined by its values at @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "no assumption is made about whether @xmath25 $ ] is an edge of either graph .",
    "our first result is a special case of the next one , but it is so useful and so easy to prove that it is worth stating separately .    [ extend ] suppose that @xmath26 are geometric graphs , that @xmath27 is a simple extension of @xmath28 for each @xmath29 , and that @xmath18 is indecomposable .",
    "then @xmath30 is also indecomposable .",
    "it is clearly sufficient to prove this when @xmath31 , and this follows from the observation in the preceding paragraph .",
    "let us illustrate how this can be applied in the simplest cases , polyhedra for which  sufficiently many \" faces are triangles @xcite .",
    "any edge is obviously indecomposable , and then proposition [ extend ] easily implies that any triangle is indecomposable . furthermore if an indecomposable geometric graph shares an edge with a triangle , then their union is easily proved to be indecomposable .",
    "it follows that the union of a _ chain _ of triangles , as defined in @xcite , is an indecomposable graph .",
    "this makes it clear that a polyhedron must be indecomposable if every face is a triangle .",
    "if every face but one is a triangle , it remains true that the triangular faces can be ordered into a chain , whose union is the entire skeleton of the polyhedron ; again indecomposability is assured .",
    "the same holds if all faces but two are triangular , and the non - triangular faces do not share an edge . if all faces but two are triangular , but the non - triangular faces do share an edge , then the triangular faces can still be ordered into a chain , whose union will contain every vertex of the polyhedron and every edge but one .",
    "so , indecomposability is assured , whenever there are two or fewer non - triangular faces .",
    "this conclusion no longer holds if we have three non - triangular faces , as the triangular prism is decomposable . on the other hand , there are also many indecomposable polyhedra with precisely three non - triangular faces . for comparison ,",
    "let us mention that that a polyhedron with only three , or fewer , triangular faces is automatically decomposable @xcite .",
    "to show how powerful proposition [ extend ] is , we note that it guarantees indecomposability of any polyhedron whose graph is either of those shown in figure [ rys1 ] . in neither example is there a chain of triangles touching every face .     two indecomposable examples without many triangles , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   two indecomposable examples without many triangles , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for the first example , begin with the edge @xmath32 , which is indecomposable , then successively add the vertices @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "each additional vertex is adjacent to two of the preceding ones ,",
    "so the resulting geometric graph is indecomposable .",
    "since it touches every face , the polyhedron is indecomposable .",
    "the second example is even quicker ; beginning with the edge @xmath32 , it is enough to add the vertices @xmath35 then @xmath9 .",
    "a similar argument also gives a particularly easy proof of the indecomposability of the example in @xcite .",
    "further applications are given in @xcite .",
    "kallay ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8) showed that if two indecomposable graphs have two common vertices , then their union is indecomposable .",
    "a prime example for this result is the 199@xmath36 polyhedron in the catalogue @xcite , which will be discussed again in the next section .",
    "we have drawn it here so that the blue edges are the union of a chain of 3 triangles , and the red edges are the union of another chain of 3 triangles .",
    "it is clear that the resulting two indecomposable geometric graphs have two vertices ( but no edge ) in common , and that their union contains every vertex .",

    "* theorem 8) .",
    "our proof is no different from kallay s but , as we shall soon see , our formulation is somewhat more powerful .",
    "it is clear from the definition that adding an edge but no vertex to an already indecomposable graph preserves its indecomposability .",
    "the point of part ( i ) is that , with a little care , we can throw away some edges and still preserve indecomposability .",
    "part ( ii ) says that if one edge of an indecomposable graph is replaced by another indecomposable graph , then the new graph is indecomposable .",
    "[ omitedge ] _",
    "( i ) _ suppose that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two geometric graphs in the same vector space , and that @xmath39 contains at least two distinct vertices .",

    "if a given polyhedron has @xmath7 vertices , @xmath9 edges and @xmath34 faces , then euler s relation @xmath143 suggests that the number of edges is a reasonable measure of its complexity .",
    "accordingly , we gave in @xcite the complete classification , in terms of decomposability , of the 58 combinatorial types of polyhedra with 14 edges .",
    "the classification of the 44 types of polyhedra with 13 or fewer edges was essentially known @xcite .    indeed , there are only four types of polyhedra with 6 , 8 or 10 edges , and they are easily seen to be indecomposable .",
    "no polyhedron can have 7 edges .",
    "besides the triangular prism , the only other polyhedron with 9 edges is the triangular bipyramid , which is obviously indecomposable .",
    "a thorough study of this topic had already been made by smilansky , who showed ( * ? ? ?",

    "the classification of polyhedra with 14 or fewer edges incidentally completed the classification of all polyhedra with 8 or fewer faces .",
    "we should recall that two polytopes are said to be _ combinatorially equivalent _ if their face lattices are isomorphic . in three dimensions ,",
    "steinitz s theorem assures us that two polyhedra are combinatorially equivalent as soon as we know that their graphs are isomorphic . in many cases , two polytopes with the same combinatorial type",
    "will either both be decomposable or both be indecomposable .",
    "smilansky @xcite first announced that this is not so for polyhedra with 14 edges , and some explicit examples were given in @xcite .",
    "we push this project a bit further in this section by completing the classification of the 158 combinatorial types of polyhedra with 15 edges .",
    "this also completes the classification of the 301 combinatorial types of polyhedra with 8 or fewer vertices .",
    "we also note the indecomposability of all higher dimensional polytopes with 15 or fewer edges .",
    "the aforementioned results of smilansky imply that a polyhedron is decomposable if @xmath147 is either @xmath148 or @xmath149 and that a polyhedron is indecomposable if @xmath150 ; these three cases account for 84 combinatorial types .",
    "our assumption that @xmath151 then tells us that the only case remaining is @xmath152 .",

    "we begin with the decomposable examples .",
    "as remarked in the opening paragraph , a triangular prism is the minkowski sum of a triangle and a line segment .",
    "if we glue a tetrahedron onto one end of a prism , we obtain the _ capped prism _ , which is decomposable as the sum of a tetrahedron and a line segment .",
    "better still , proposition [ shp ] guarantees that any polyhedron combinatorially equivalent to this will be decomposable .",
    "there are two ways to glue a second tetrahedron onto the capped prism .",
    "either we glue it onto one face of the first tetrahedron , or we glue it onto the remaining triangular face of the original prism . in both cases ,",
    "we obtain a polyhedron with 8 vertices and 9 faces .",
    "all three are pictured here , the latter two being numbers 182 and 198 respectively from the list of @xcite .         in case",
    "the three edges which lie between pairs of quadrilateral faces are all parallel , each of the latter two polyhedra will be decomposable , being the sum of a triangular bipyramid and a line segment . since one of them has vertices of degree 5 and the other does not , they are not combinatorially equivalent .",
    "this exemplifies the fact that the combinatorial type of two polyhedra does not determine the type of their sum .",
    "our diagrams are not identical to those in @xcite ; we have drawn them slightly differently to emphasize their decomposability .",
    "it is true , but not totally obvious , that any polyhedron combinatorially equivalent to these two is decomposable .",
    "let us prove it .",
    "proposition [ shp ] clearly implies that @xcite is decomposable ( but not necessarily that a line segment will be a summand ) . for @xcite ,",
    "recall that the capped prism is decomposable , and then apply proposition [ easy ] .",
    "now let us look at the indecomposable examples .",
    "numbers 129 , 130 and 131 each have one hexagonal face and 8 triangular faces .",
    "each of examples 132155 has one pentagonal face , one quadrilateral face and 7 triangular faces .",
    "indecomposability of all these examples is assured by our remarks in the previous section , because they have at most two non - triangular faces .",
    "examples 156181 , 183197 and 199202 all have three quadrilateral and six triangular faces . by inspection ,",
    "all but six of them ( namely 173 , 179 , 187 , 190 , 192 and 199 ) are indecomposable because ( some of ) their triangular faces can be ordered into a chain whose union touches every face .",
    "we note also that for some examples , the chain of indecomposable triangles does not contain every vertex .",
    "( in particular , 157 and several others each have a vertex which does not lie in any triangular face . )",
    "thus the weakness of the assumption , that the chain only touches every face , is significant .",
    "proposition [ fourcycle ] implies the indecomposability of examples 173 , 179 , 187 , 190 and 192 from britton and dunitz .",
    "alternatively , their indecomposability can also be established by proposition [ extend ] .",
    "none of these examples contains a connected sequence of triangular faces touching every face , so some new technique was needed .",
    "we present here their diagrams , with an appropriate 4-cycle highlighted in red . in each case , three vertices of the 4-cycle lie in one face , while the fourth does not , so the 4-cycle can not be coplanar .",
    "the diagrams make it clear that the 4-cycle touches every face .",
    "this time , we have used the same diagrams as in @xcite , except that for aesthetic reasons we have reversed the front and back faces of 190 and 192 .",
    "finally , we recall from  1 that 199 is also indecomposable .",
    "we remark that all higher dimensional polytopes with 15 or fewer edges are indecomposable ; this extends ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.11 ) .",
    "the  smallest \" @xmath2-dimensional polytope , the simplex , obviously has exactly @xmath153 edges .",

    "this condition forces indecomposability by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6 ) .    for the converse , we need to consider various possible values for @xmath155 .",
    "we will simply describe the examples , and not verify all the details .",
    "a particularly simple decomposable polytope with 18 edges is the sum of two triangles lying in orthogonal planes .",
    "the sum of a 4-dimensional simplex with a line segment , which is parallel to one 2-face but not parallel to any edge of the simplex , will have 19 edges .",
