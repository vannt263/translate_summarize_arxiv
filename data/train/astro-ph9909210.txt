    "at one time , radio sources offered the only readily available means of locating galaxies at large redshifts ( @xmath3 ) , and were thus studied as a window on the early history of galaxy evolution .",
    "radio galaxies obey a tight near  infrared hubble ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) relation and",
    "are frequently associated with rich cluster environments .",
    "this suggests that there is an evolutionary sequence linking high - redshift radio galaxies to low - redshift giant ellipticals and cd galaxies . the discovery that many high - redshift radio galaxies have elongated , complex uv continuum structures aligned with the radio source axis ( mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 ; chambers et al .",
    "1987 ) suggested that the active nucleus might affect the uv morphology and possibly even the evolutionary history of the host galaxy .",
    "it was believed that some radio galaxies might be true `` protogalaxies '' forming the bulk of their stars via some process induced by the radio jets .",
    "however , later studies have shown that in many cases the aligned uv continuum arises largely from scattered agn emission ( di serego alighieri et al .",
    "1989 ) and/or nebular continuum emission ( dickson et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the spectacular , complex structures seen in optical wfpc2 images of 3cr radio galaxies by ( e.g. ) best et al .",
    "( 1997 ) are , in many cases , agn  related `` ephemera '' surrounding a more normal host galaxy .",
    "however , the brightness of this aligned , blue light makes it difficult to study the properties of the underlying stellar component when observing at optical wavelengths .",
    "observers have therefore turned to the near  ir , where the agn  related emission is fainter and the stellar component brighter .",
    "rigler et al .  ( 1992 ) , dickinson et al .  (",
    "1994 ) and best et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , among others , have shown that some 3cr radio galaxies are rounder and more symmetric when observed in the near  ir , suggesting the presence of relatively `` normal '' host galaxies underlying the uv  bright , aligned continuum ( but see also eisenhardt & chokshi 1990 ) .",
    "but until now these ground  based studies have been limited by angular resolution .",
    "now , using nicmos on board hst , we can for the first time study the near  ir morphologies of high redshift galaxies with resolution comparable to that of the pioneering wfpc2 studies of these same objects .",
    "our sample consists of 11 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath1 , imaged with nicmos camera 2 , which provides diffraction limited images at 1.6@xmath0 m .",
    "we used bandpasses ( f160w or f165 m ) which avoid strong nebular emission lines , which could significantly contaminate the fluxes and affect the observed morphologies .",
    "optical wfpc2 imaging is available for the whole sample : in many cases we have unusually deep and often polarimetric wfpc2 data , while in others archival data by best et al .",
    "1997 or other sources were used . in most cases we also have extensive ground  based supporting data ( spectroscopy , polarimetry , etc . ) from the w.m .",
    "keck observatory and other facilities .",
    "the nicmos and wfpc2 images of four galaxies from this sample are shown in figure 1 .",
    "we have fit psf ",
    "convolved models to the nicmos images using a hybrid scheme which matches 1d surface brightness profiles and 2d pa  +  ellipticity information .",
    "the models and the nicmos image residuals after model subtraction are also shown in figure 1 . in most cases ,",
    "the nicmos images show that the rest ",
    "frame optical light from powerful 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath3 is rounder , smoother , more symmetric and centrally concentrated than that observed at rest  frame uv wavelengths .",
    "the complex , aligned structures seen in wfpc2 images are generally much less pronounced in the near  ir , although in several cases ( e.g. 3c 280 , 3c 266 , 3c 368 ) the highest surface brightness regions of the aligned components can still be detected . in several cases , the near  ir surface brightness peaks at the position of a local _ minimum _ in the wfpc2 images , suggesting the effects of dust lanes affecting the near  uv morphologies .",
    "a few galaxies ( e.g. , 3c  265 ) appear to have nuclear point sources in the ir , possibly showing the `` unveiled '' agn .",
    "overall , the gross morphologies and surface brightness profiles of most 3cr hosts are consistent with their being high luminosity giant elliptical galaxies , already structurally mature .",
    "this may be true as early as @xmath6 , although at that redshift 3c  239 appears to have `` ragged edges '' perhaps suggesting that it is in the process of accreting material through mergers .",
    "however , the most distant galaxy in our sample , 3c  256 at @xmath7 , is radically different than the others .",
    "it is elongated , aligned , diffuse , and underluminous , and thus may be the exceptional example of a young radio galaxy early in the stages of its formation ( see also eisenhardt & dickinson 1992 , simpson et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in figure 2 , we plot surface brightness vs.  effective radius ( the `` kormendy relation '' ) for 6 galaxies which are well fit by @xmath8law models , converting the nicmos photometry ( rest  frame @xmath90.57 to 0.88@xmath0 m for our sample ) to rest  frame gunn  @xmath10",
    "( @xmath11 m ) for comparison to nearby cluster ellipticals .",
    "the galaxies are physically smaller than the largest and brightest giant cluster ellipticals at @xmath12 , and have higher rest  frame surface brightnesses as would be expected given nominal luminosity evolution .",
    "most fall on the locus of constant luminosity ( see also best et al .",
    "1998 ) , as might be expected given the small @xmath4@xmath5 scatter .",
    "3c  239 at @xmath13 is significantly more luminous for its size compared to the galaxies at @xmath14 .",
