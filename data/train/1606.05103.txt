    "the goal of this paper is to describe a class of cylindrically symmetric solutions to the three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath0 for a complex - valued function @xmath1 . in the regime which we shall describe , it turns out that the gross - pitaevskii equation bears some resemblance with the euler equation for flows of incompressible fluids @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the velocity field and @xmath4 is the pressure field .",
    "in this analogy , the role of the velocity @xmath5 is played by the current and @xmath6 we write @xmath7 and @xmath8 . ] @xmath9 and the vorticity field @xmath10 therefore corresponds , up to a factor of two , to the jacobian @xmath11    in his celebrated work @xcite on the euler equation , helmholtz considered with great attention the situation where the vorticity field @xmath12 is concentrated in a `` circular vortex - filament of very small section '' , a thin vortex ring . a central question in helmholtz s work , as far as dynamics is concerned , is related to the possible forms of stability of the family of such vortex rings , allowing a change in time of cross - section , radius , position or even possibly of inner profile , and a description of these evolutions .",

    "even though it has been widely studied since helmholtz , as far as we know it has not been mathematically justified in the context of the euler equation , even in the axi - symmetric case without swirl . as a matter of fact , the interaction leading to the leapfrogging motion is somehow borderline in strength compared to the stability of isolated vortex rings .",
    "[ fig : one ]     our main results in this paper , theorem [ thm : main_asympt ] and [ thm : main ] below , provide a mathematical justification to the leapfrogging motion of two or more vortex rings in the context of the axi - symmetric three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "a well - known particularity of the gross - pitaevskii equation is that vortex ring intensities are necessarily quantized . for stability reasons , we only consider simply quantized rings .",

    "the next figure illustrates the global behavior of the phase portrait , with three distinct regions which we have called `` _ pass through _ '' , `` _ attract then repel _ '' and `` _ leapfrogging _ '' .",
    "the leapfrogging region corresponds to the central part , where all solutions are periodic in time ; its interpretation was discussed earlier in this introduction . in the pass through region",
    ", the first vortex ring always remains the smallest , hence quickest , of the two vortex rings : being initially located below the second vortex ring on the z - axis it first catches up , then passes inside the second and finally gets away in front of it . instead",
    ", in the attract then repel region the first vortex ring initially starts to catch up , but doing so its circular radius increases whereas the one of the second vortex ring decreases , up to a point where both vortex rings have the same radius and the first still lag behind the second . from that point on",
    ", the first one has a larger radius than the second , and therefore the second increases its lead indefinitely .",
    "the behavior in those last two regions is actually very much reminiscent of two - solitons interactions in the korteweg - de vries equation , in particular the speeds at plus and minus infinity in time are equal or exchanged .",
    "notice also that the two points at the common boundary of the three regions correspond , up to labeling , to the same situation : two vortex rings travel with the same constant speed at a special mutual distance    , we do not know whether such special solutions exist at the level of equation @xmath92 . ]    .",
    "[ fig : two ]    the typical size of the leapfrogging region is also described in the figure . in particular , it shrinks and becomes more flat as @xmath52 decreases towards zero .",
    "we present two results in this section .",
    "the first one follows rather easily from the second , but its statement has the advantage of being somewhat simpler . on the other hand , it involves a limiting procedure @xmath93 whereas the second one is valid for small but fixed values of @xmath94    in order to state those results , and in view of the size of the leapfrogging region mentioned at the end of the previous subsection , we fix some @xmath95 , an integer @xmath96 , and @xmath57 distinct points @xmath97 in @xmath46 .",
    "the initial positions of the cores of the vortex rings are then set to be @xmath98 as a matter of fact , this is the appropriate scaling for which * relative * self - motion and interactions between vortex - rings are of the same magnitude . in any scaling in which @xmath99 as @xmath100 for all i , the `` leading - order '' vortex motion is expected to be a translation with constant velocity @xmath101 in the vertical direction and in the rescaled time .",
    "the above scaling is the appropriate one for which , in the next - order correction , the difference in the self - motion speeds ( due to different values of the radii at the next order ) and interaction between vortices are of the same magnitude . in the case of two vortices , for example , this will give rise to small - scale periodic corrections to a leading - order translation , which is the signature of `` leapfrogging '' .",
    "note that @xmath102 provided @xmath52 is sufficiently small , which we assume throughout .",
    "concerning their evolution , we consider the solution to the cauchy problem for the system of ordinary differential equations @xmath103 and",
    "we finally set @xmath104 system ( ) and describe the main order asymptotic of @xmath82 in the leapfrogging region , after a proper rescaling in time .    we will prove    [ thm : main_asympt ] let @xmath105 be a family of initial data for @xmath67 such that @xmath106 as @xmath100 , for any open subset @xmath76 strongly included in @xmath27 .",
    "assume also that @xmath107 then , for every @xmath108 and every open subset @xmath76 strongly included in @xmath27 we have @xmath109 where we denote by @xmath110 the solution of @xmath67 with initial datum @xmath111 and evaluated at time @xmath112 and where the points @xmath113 are defined in through the solution of the system ( lf ) .    in the statement of theorem [ thm : main_asympt ] , the @xmath114 norm is defined by @xmath115    [ rem:1 ] asymptotic formulas for the potential vectors @xmath116 ( see appendix a ) lead to the equivalence @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 also , expansion of the squares leads directly to @xmath120 and therefore @xmath121 where @xmath122 the function @xmath123 , which does not depend upon @xmath52 , is precisely the hamiltonian for the system ( lf ) . a second quantity preserved by ( lf )",

    "to finish this introduction , let us mention that we have not analyzed the convergence of @xmath67 towards @xmath82 in the `` pass through '' and `` attract then repel '' regions .",
    "it is conceivable , yet probably difficult , to obtain closeness estimates valid for all times in those cases , reminiscent of what is sometimes called orbital stability of multi - solitons , e.g. in the korteweg  -  de  vries equation @xcite or the 1d gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "one would have to deal with algebraic rather than exponential interaction estimates .    also , having in mind the initial question related to the euler equation , let us mention that one crucial advantage in the analysis of the gross - pitaevskii equation is that it has an inherent core localization scale @xmath94 on the other hand , euler velocity fields are divergence free , whereas gross - pitaevskii ones only have small divergence when averaged in time .",
    "analysis of leapfrogging for the euler equation would therefore probably require a different strategy",

    "the overall strategy follows many of the lines which we adopted in our prior work @xcite on the inhomogeneous gross - pitaevskii equation this is critical in the sense that interaction of vortices with the background potential and with each other are of the same order of magnitude . in the present work , by contrast",
