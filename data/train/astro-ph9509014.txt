    "the still unsolved question of the origin and evolution of the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is a central topic in modern cosmology .",
    "the scientific approach to this problem is based on three columns :    1 .",
    "the distribution of matter in the universe is assumed to be traced by luminous galaxies .",
    "thus , observation of galaxies and measurement of their redshifts is , besides peculiar ",
    "velocity measurements , the only way to gain an idea of the matter distribution in our local area of the universe .",
    "todays powerful computer systems make the numerical simulation of statistical ensembles of theoretical models of structure formation possible . by this way effects of different dark matter models on the resulting structures",
    "can be studied .",
    "the comparison of observations with theoretical models is made in terms of statistical measures which can be applied to both , real and simulated galaxy distributions .",
    "thus , models can either be sorted out or favoured and improved to fit observational results .",
    "the introduced statistical method belongs to the third column and offers a new approach for finding adequate measures which are capable of discribing and characterizing global and local features of galaxy distributions .",
    "it was first suggested by mecke , buchert and wagner @xcite , but only now numerical problems are overcome and first results can be gained .",
    "popular measures in that field include _ n - point correlation functions _",
    "@xcite , _ counts - in - cells _",
    "@xcite , _ void probability functions _",
    "@xcite , _ percolation analysis _",
    "@xcite , _ minimal spanning trees _",
    "@xcite , _ genus of isodensity levels _",
    "@xcite , _ voronoi - foam statistics",
    "_ @xcite and many more .",
    "after discussing the basic properties of minkowski - functionals  in section [ 2_minkowski ] , the new statistical method is presented in section [ 3_method ] .",
    "its sensitivity to different components of the lss ( clusters , walls , filaments ) is investigated , using toy - models based on voronoi - tesselations , and the selection of structures by the means of _ conditional subsampling _ is illustrated ( section [ 4_toy ] ) . finally the method is applied to a series of cdm - simulations in section [ 5_sim ] , a short summary is given in section [ 6_con ] , and an outlook on future prospects in section [ 7_out ] .",
    "the minkowski - functionals  have their origin in the mathematical theory of convex bodies and integral geometry . in @xmath0 dimensions there",
    "exist @xmath1 of these functionals including _ geometrical _ and _ topological _ descriptors to characterize content ( volume and surface ) , shape and connectivity of a body @xmath2 :    in the case of three dimensions we have :    here , shape is expressed in terms of the integral mean curvature @xmath3 of a body s surface , and the integral gaussian curvature @xmath4 , related to the euler - characteristic @xmath5 via the gau - bonnet theorem , is a measure for the connectivity .",
    "important properties of the minkowski - functionals  include :    [ cols=\"<,>,^ , < \" , ]     thus , the measures are invariant against translations and rotations of the body or combinations @xmath6 of the two .",
    "the  of a body @xmath7 , which is the union of two point sets @xmath8 and @xmath9 , obey a simple additivity relation that can be extended by induction to an arbitrary number of components of @xmath7 . except for the volume ,",
    "all other measures are located on the surface of the considered body .",
    "the euler - characteristic  @xmath10 of a body @xmath8 is related to its _ genus _",
    "@xmath11 @xmath12 so in three dimensions can be expressed by : @xmath13 in this way it can be used as a _ topological _",
    "measure for the connectivity of a point set .",
    "in a given distribution the points ( galaxies ) are represented by their cartesian coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "the input data are the coordinates of all the @xmath15 points inside a cubic volume @xmath16 that is cut out of the point distribution .",
    "this cube is then scaled to an edgelength of one ( unit cube @xmath17 ) . outside this box",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used , i.e. @xmath17 is supplemented by 26 identical boxes around it . for the calculations , on every point a ball @xmath18 with radius @xmath19",
    "is centered ( boolean grain model ) .",
    "the minkowski measures of the point set @xmath20 which consists of all the points inside the union of the balls are then calculated , partly using numerical methods .",
    "actually the _ local _ contributions @xmath21 to the functionals from the surface of each single ball @xmath22 ( i=1, ...",
    ",n ) are determined and _ global _ measures arise by taking the mean of all the @xmath21 for a given radius @xmath19 .",
    "it can be shown that these global results contain @xmath23-point correlations of every order @xmath23 .",
    "the radius @xmath19 of the balls is the parameter that is needed to analyze the distribution on different scales . for small radii most of the balls",
    "are isolated , thus yielding the measures of a ball ( @xmath24 ) . with growing @xmath19 more and more balls intersect and",
    "connect to network - like structures ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "finally , the network turns into a body with enclosed cavities ( @xmath26 ) which then are filled when the cube @xmath17 ist totally overlapped by @xmath27 .",
    "= 13.0 cm      the mean values of the minkowski - functionals  can be calculated analytically for a stationary poisson process @xcite .",
    "the radius is scaled by the mean distance @xmath28 between the points in the cube @xmath17 .",
    "a toy model for the artificial generation of structures , roughly similar in to the ones observed in the universe , is based on * voronoi tesselations * :    = 12.5 cm    a poissonian distribution of points ( `` nuclei '' ) inside @xmath17 defines a pattern of _ wigner - seitz - cells _ , the tesselation . in a second step",
    "a number of @xmath15 test - points is randomly distributed inside @xmath17 .",
    "then these points are projected onto the walls , or edges , or vertices of the tesselation , thus generating sheets ( or walls ) , filaments or clusters .",
    "for all these structure components one can choose a finite thickness and the ratio of points ending up in each of them .",
    "the method is sensitive to different structures in a distribution of points .",
    "this can be illustrated by looking at the local contributions to the euler - characteristic  on the surface @xmath29 of each ball .",
    "as is equivalent to the integrated gaussian curvature of the considered body , it can be split into three contributions@xcite , coming from the uncovered surface ( @xmath30 ) , the intersection lines ( @xmath31 ) of two balls on @xmath29 and the triplepoints ( @xmath32 ) where three balls have a common point on @xmath29 .",
    "surface points , that belong to more than three balls have a low probability and can be neglected .",
    "while for walls , includes contributions from lines and triplepoints over a wide range of @xmath33 , hardly any triplepoints appear for filaments .",
    "the euler - characteristic  has a narrow minimum for clustered distributions , but no distinct minimum for filaments .",
    "structures can be detected and analyzed by selecting only galaxies with a local contribution to a functional inside a given interval .",
    "as an example we consider a mixture of filaments ( @xmath34 points ) generated in the voronoi model and a poissonian distribution ( also @xmath34 points ) .",
    "we can extract the filament component by suitable conditions on the local contributions to the minkowski - functionals : typical for filaments , e.g. , is @xmath35 ( see figure [ idl_localrwfc]and figure 8) ; we have chosen the condition @xmath36 .",
    "the results show clearly the different reaction of the minkowski - functionals to the three spatial patterns . for a constant power spectrum",
    "@xmath37 many small clusters can form , while for negative @xmath23 bigger structures appear . in the case of @xmath38 the ratio of galaxies in clusters is higher than for @xmath39 , so the volume and surface measures yield lower values , while the mean curvature remains positive .",
    "for negative @xmath23 the points outside of clusters are part of a network generated by the corresponding balls in the grain model , thus adding high surface contributions and negative curvature values ( curvature of intersection lines @xmath40 ! ) .",
    "the introduced statistical method is based on a solid mathematical background and no special assumptions about the sample have to be made .",
    "the mean values of the functionals over the balls in a sample are statistically unbiased descriptors and include topological _ and _ geometrical measures , containing n - point correlations of every order@xcite .",
    "they are statistically robust even for small samples and depend on the radius of balls which is the ( single ) diagnostic parameter in the boolean grain model .",
    "the method is efficient in discriminating spatial patterns and selecting structures by the means of conditional subsampling .",
    "the calculation of the family of minkowski",
    " functionals by using a boolean model of penetrable grains and evaluating the local ( per grain ) contributions to the functionals @xmath41 on the surface of the overlapping union of grains is an effective way of characterizing the local as well as the global morphology of point processes , as we have just shown .    as a result of the _ local _ calculation of the contributions to the mf s ,",
    "this method offers a variety of different informations by _ conditional subsampling _ and by using various combinations of mf s .",
    "the latter is necessary as noted earlier @xcite : the euler characteristic alone is not a preferable tool to discriminate similar point processes ( compare fig.2 left and right panels in @xcite and fig.11 ) .",
    "in addition , geometrical information is needed , which is furnished by the other mf s .",
    "only all @xmath42 measures can ( within the class of additive and motion invariant measures ) completely characterize the morphology .    the current numerical code to calculate the mf s performs with reasonable storage and cpu time ( we need about 180250 mb storage and 16 h cpu time , depending on machine and degree of clustering , to realize , e.g. , a sample of @xmath43 points ) .    in our statistics group ( sfb 375/b3 )",
    "we currently work on an alternative way to calculate the mf s : we use a grid and calculate the mf s by their contributions per grid cell on a sufficiently fine grid spacing .",
    "the resulting code is comparatively fast and storage efficient .",
    "moreover , it implies another advantage : in addition to point samples we can consider density or temperature fields ( given on a grid ) which renders the method applicable to smoothed cosmic density fields and microwave background maps . smoothing is another key ",
    "element of this method which defines one of our near future perspectives .",
    "we calculate the mf s of smoothed fields ( employing , e.g. gaussian filters ) . introducing a second diagnostic parameter ( e.g. a density threshold ) , this method covers the topology approach by gott , melott , weinberg and collab .",
    "( see : @xcite and ref .",
    "therein ) , where we use @xmath42 functionals instead of just one .",
    "we here try to restore motion invariance ( with respect to the discrete group of motions ) and additivity , two important properties to allow for a local characterization of morphology .",
    "this method will also cover the topological / geometrical approach on a grid introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will combine , so  called _ koenderink measures _ ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) with mf s .",
    "koenderink measures provide a set of specific filters which extract different pattern recogition elements from a smoothed point set . for different smoothing lengths the performance of these filters displays an optimum on some smoothing scale .      a further perspective concerns _ stereological applications _ of mf s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e. , the possibility of extracting 3d informations from lower  dimensional data sets ( such as pencil beam surveys ) .",
    "it will be necessary to analyse smoothed and unsmoothed minkowski  measures in the three  dimensional space compared with those in projected distributions .",
    "we would like to thank rien van de weygaert for providing his voronoi tesselation code , and simon white for providing his n  body simulation results ; we have benefited from numerous discussions with them and with gerhard brner , stefan gottlber , martin kerscher , houjun mo , jens schmalzing and herbert wagner ."
