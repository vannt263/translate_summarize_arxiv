    "the alkali cobaltates na@xmath0coo@xmath1 have been the subject of intense interest as they are a rare example of competing interactions on a triangular lattice that can be easily tuned by chemical means . varying the amount of na ( @xmath8 ) produces a rich phase diagram which exhibits spin dependent thermopower ( @xmath20.75)@xcite , metal - insulator transitions ( @xmath20.5)@xcite , antiferromagnetism and 5k superconductivity at @xmath20.3 for a hydrated compound@xcite .",
    "more recently it has been realized both experimentally and theoretically that the role of the na ions goes beyond providing a simple means to electronically dope the coo@xmath1 layer@xcite .",
    "rather , the ordering of na - ions leads to a potential that perturbs the coo@xmath1 layer to produce strong electronic correlations@xcite .",
    "the role of these correlations is still under investigation but it demonstrates that these materials can exhibit frustration in two different ways , one by the triangular topology of the coo@xmath1 layer and the other by the na induced potential .",
    "this double frustration is best exhibited at half - doping . here",
    "the na ordering results in a relatively simple orthorhombic distortion of the parent hexagonal phase in sharp contrast to the complex incommensurate structures found for higher @xmath8 compounds@xcite . for @xmath20.5 na - ions order as to form stripes as shown in fig.[strt ] while the magnetic susceptibility shows two abrupt decreases ( see for example inset in fig.[powder ] ) at @xmath7=88k and at @xmath9=52k@xcite .",
    "the first transition is associated with the onset of a long range antiferromagnetic ordering@xcite while the second transition coincides with a sharp rise in the resistivity@xcite .",
    "this second transition has been ascribed to be driven by charge ordering ( co ) of a @xmath10 electron to form distinct ls co@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and ls co@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) ions @xcite .",

    "what is striking in this cobaltate is that the sequence of charge ordering and nel transitions is reversed ( @xmath9@xmath18@xmath7 ) , compared to classic charge ordered systems such as the manganites@xcite or magnetite@xcite and has brought the charge ordering picture into some doubt . to reconcile the fact that @xmath9@xmath18@xmath7 , bobroff _ et al._@xcite propose on the basis of nmr measurements a scenario of a successive nesting of the fermi surface ( fs ) that is coupled to a spin density wave in a way in which charge carriers are localized successively with decreasing temperature",
    "however , this idea has been more recently disputed as the role of the na - ions and the crystal potential that they impose on the coo@xmath1 layer has been theoretically treated better . for example stripe na ordering induces a weak incipient charge ordering on the coo@xmath1 layer@xcite , however the mechanism of a progressive nesting of the fs with decreasing temperature arises directly from the na - ordering as shown by a hubbard model using the spatially unrestricted gutzwiller approximation@xcite . here",
    "the charge ordering is viewed to be driven by the ordering of na above the antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath7=88k @xcite .",

    "the co(2)o@xmath17 octahedron is more regular with bond lengths varying between 1.88 to 1.91  .",
    "this indicates that the co(1 ) ions experience essentially a different crystalline potential than the co(2 ) ions , as a direct consequence of the na ordering . in fig .",
    "[ bonds](a , b ) we show the temperature dependence of the co - o bond lengths for the two co sites . from these data",
    "it is evident that the larger distortion of the co(1)o@xmath17 octahedron is maintained from low until high temperature , while the spread of bond lengths for the co(2)o@xmath17 is smaller and relatively temperature invariant .",
    "these octahedral distortions can be quantified by the parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the average co - o bond length and the summation is done over the 6 co - o bonds . here @xmath33 would be zero for a regular octahedron with 6 equivalent co - o bonds .",

    "comparison of these bond lengths at 1.8k to the ideal ls co@xmath11 and co@xmath13-o bond lengths of 1.93 and 1.83respectively would suggest that there is no evidence for integer charge separation between co(1 ) and co(2 ) sites .",
    "the analysis of the experimentally determined co - o bond lengths using the bond valence sum ( bvs ) method allows us to estimate the difference in the valance of the two co - ions . for the calculation of the bvs we used @xmath370.37 and @xmath381.70-o bonds .",

    "the behavior of @xmath44 for the na - ions however is unusual in that there is a clear change in slope at 300k separating a low and a high temperature behavior , while for t@xmath47300k the @xmath44 values for na become large .",
    "such behavior is indicative of a dynamical transition occurring at 300k involving only the motion of na - ions , as similar signatures are absent for the co- and o - atoms@xcite .",
    "indeed such large vales of @xmath44 suggest that na - ions may become mobile between coo@xmath1 layers above 300k .    for higher temperatures",

    "this correlated behavior in general indicates a displacement of na - ions along the @xmath48axis . at 150k",
    "we find that the small charge disproportionation in the coo@xmath1 layer is not reflected in the na - o bonds .",
    "surprisingly however we find that at @xmath7  a decrease of @xmath360.01  of the long na(1)-o bond and a correlated increase in the short na(1)-o bond , while for the na(2)-o bond lengths an opposite and less clear effect can be seen in the data .",
    "we interpret these changes in the na - o bond lengths as reflecting changes in the electronic state of the coo@xmath1 layer at @xmath7 .",
    "the nature of any coupling between changes in the electronic state of the coo@xmath1 and na can arises from the orbital configuration of the co - ion itself .",
    "it is argued by kroll _",
    "et al._@xcite that the edge - sharing co@xmath13o@xmath17 octahedra are compressed along the @xmath49axis reduces the point group symmetry to @xmath50 .",

    "the latter orbital looks like a @xmath53 orbital and points along the @xmath49axis@xcite . for the case of the higher valent co(1)-ion ( nominally co@xmath13 ) , this orbital would point in between the o - atoms and towards the na(1)-atom as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ na_bonds](a ) .",
    "since the charge disproportionation here is small each co ions will have a similar electronic and orbital configuration .",
    "therefore the orbital configuration of the co - ions provides a means to couple electronically the coo@xmath1 and na layers .",
    "the nature of the coupling is electrostatic and would arise from the occupation of the @xmath52 orbital .",
    "we would expect that changes in the electronic configuration of the coo@xmath1 sheet to be reflected also in the relative positions of the na - ions as indicated by the na - o bond lengths .",
    "more precisely changes in the electronic state of co should be clearest for the na(1)-o bonds as the na(1)-ion sits directly above ( or below ) a co(1)-ion .",
    "the same argument would suggest a less pronounced effect for the na(2)-o bond lengths as the na(2 ) ion resides above and between coo@xmath17 octahedra .",
    "this is indeed reflected in the bond length data where a strong response is found in the na(1)-o bonds and a less clear responce in the na(2)-o bonds . at @xmath9",
    "we find no clear evidence of changes in the na - o bond lengths .",
    "this is expected as the changes in charge separation at this lower transition are computed to be much smaller than those at @xmath7@xcite .",

    "while our npd work can correlate the distortion of the coo@xmath17 octahedra and the na - ordering even at high temperatures , it is not until  that we find evidence for a weak charge separation into stripes .",
    "indeed it is possible that this pattern of charge ordering is present in the lattice from the onset as a direct result of the na - ordering but it in effect is hidden by the dynamic behavior of the na - ions .",
    "therefore we argue that the charge ordering emerges at low temperatures as na - motion becomes more confined .",

    "this is consistent with recent theoretical models that suggest that the na potential imposes a degree of charge ordering to the lattice@xcite .",

    "the orbital configuration of the co provides for charge density pointing directly to the na(1)-ions thus providing a sensitive parameter to electronic changes in the coo@xmath1 layer .",
