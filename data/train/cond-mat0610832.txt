    "<S> a one - dimensional system with two @xmath0-like barriers or wells bi - chromaticaly oscillating at frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 is considered . the alternating signal leads to the direct current across the structure ( even in a symmetric system ) . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of this quantum pump are studied in a wide range of the system parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum pump is a device that generates the stationary current under action of alternating voltage ; it is a subject of numerous recent publications ( for example , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum pump is essentially analogous to various versions of the photovoltaic effect studied in details from the beginning of the eighties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is that the photovoltaic effect is related to the emergence of a direct current in a homogeneous macroscopic medium ( the only exception is the mesoscopic photovoltaic effect ) , while the pump is a microscopic object . from the phenomenological point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the emergence of a direct current in the pump is not surprising , since any asymmetric microcontact can rectify ac voltage . </S>",
    "<S> however , analysis of adiabatic transport in the quantum - mechanical object leads to new phenomena , such as quantization of charge transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> just this , analytically solvable , adiabatic approach was utilized in the most of studies of quantum pumps @xcite . in the recent papers we have carried out the extensive study of the simplest model of the one - dimensional quantum pump , containing two delta - like harmonically oscillating barriers / wells . </S>",
    "<S> this model demonstrates rich behavior which is ruled by a variety of system parameters . the present paper deals with similar system to which alternating bi - chromatic voltages are applied . </S>",
    "<S> the system can be exemplified by a quantum wire with two narrow gates . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary bias between the source and the drain is supposedly absent .    </S>",
    "<S> the system has a variety of regimes of the pump operation , depending on the system parameters , e.g. frequency and amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is sensitive to the phase coherence of alternating signals and can exist even in symmetric systems . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary current is possible also in the case of different amplitudes of alternating fields . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the system both analytically and numerically . </S>",

    "<S> the elastic , absorption and emission channels participate in the process . </S>",
    "<S> the case of strong alternating signal was studied numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> we mostly concentrate on the case of symmetric system as more interesting by its phase sensitivity .      </S>",

    "<S> ( in the final formulas , we mark the directions of incident waves by the indices  @xmath17  and  @xmath18  ) . </S>",
    "<S> the form of solution ( [ wf ] ) corresponds to absorption ( for @xmath19 ) or emission ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath21 field quanta by an electron after interaction with the vibrating barriers ; @xmath22 relates to the elastic process . </S>",
    "<S> quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 give the corresponding amplitudes of transmission ( reflection ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the value of @xmath25 becomes imaginary , the waves moving away from the barriers should be treated as damped waves , so that @xmath26 .    </S>",

    "<S> provided that electrons from the right and left of the pump are in equilibrium , and that they have identical chemical potentials @xmath31 , the stationary current is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the fermi distribution function , and @xmath34 is the heaviside step function . </S>",
    "<S> the current is determined by the transmission coefficients with real @xmath25 only .    at a low temperature , it is convenient to differentiate the current with respect to the chemical potential : @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the conductance quantum and @xmath37 is the fermi momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant quantity @xmath38 can be treated as a two - terminal photoconductance ( the conductance for simultaneous change of chemical potentials of source and drain ) .      in low - amplitude limit </S>",
    "<S> the stationary current ( its derivative @xmath38 ) is proportional to @xmath39    let s consider the case of symmetric system with @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the systems symmetry leads to the dependence @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution arises from corresponding terms in the transmission coefficients @xmath42 : @xmath43    the quantities @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 depend on @xmath49 , @xmath50 which contains one- and two - photon singularities . </S>",

    "<S> the peaks of the curves correspond to the multi - photon threshold resonances with zero energy state . </S>",
    "<S> the increasing of @xmath55 leads to the strengthening of multi - photon singularities .    the curve in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] corresponds to antipodal signals with same amplitudes @xmath56 , that demonstrate the importance of the phase coherency of the signals ( in such conditions the stationary current in the same system under monochromatic voltage is vanishing @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current oscillates with the fermi momentum due to the interference of the electron waves in the structure . besides , the current possesses singularities caused by the resonances with the zero energy state and their photon repetitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the figure [ fig5 ] shows the behavior of @xmath52 for large enough frequency where the only threshold singularity exists in the concerned range of fermi momentum values .    </S>",
    "<S> the figure [ fig6 ] depicts @xmath52 _ versus _ @xmath57 for the symmetric system ( @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these values are chosen so that there should be no current caused by harmonic signals only ( if @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> besides , the current vanishes in the adiabatic approximation which is commonly used for consideration of quantum pumps . in the adiabatic regime </S>",
    "<S> the charge transfer per a cycle is proportional to the area covered by two parameters in the phase space . in our case </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath58 the trajectory in the phase space @xmath61 is a straight line and covers zero area ( see insert ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence in the adiabatic ( @xmath62 ) approximation @xmath63 .    at low @xmath3 @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior corresponds to coherent photovoltaic effect @xcite . at large @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude dependence exhibits distinctive oscillations which are determined by the commensurability of the characteristic wavelength of excited electrons with the distance between delta - functions . </S>",
    "<S> the curves for different frequencies demonstrate splitting and beating of oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> their amplitude decays with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations period changes with the frequency .    </S>",
    "<S> the figure [ fig7 ] demonstrates the dependence of @xmath52 on the frequency . the complicated structure of @xmath52 in the low frequency region is explained by multi - photon resonances reducing for larger frequencies </S>"
