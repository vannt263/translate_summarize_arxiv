    "the cosmological standard model is based on the cosmological principle according to which our universe is spatially homogeneous and isotropic at large scales . the value of the corresponding homogeneity scale is a matter of debate but it is assumed to be about one order of magnitude smaller than the size of the observable universe . on smaller scales , scales of galaxy clusters and below , the cosmos is clearly inhomogeneous .",
    "mathematically , the cosmological principle implies the existence of time orthogonal subspaces of constant curvature , i.e. , it is characterized by true symmetries of the spacetime .",
    "a possibly more realistic view is to regard the universe as only statistically homogeneous and isotropic as a result of a suitable averaging procedure over inhomogeneities and without assuming a fictitious highly symmetric background . how to perform averages in general relativity ( gr ) and particularly in cosmology is not yet a really established issue . nevertheless , there are well motivated approaches which are believed to capture essential features of the problem @xcite .",
    "the structures in the universe are characterized by different length scales : the scale of the solar system , the scale of galaxies , the scale of galaxy clusters and the homogeneity scale .",
    "it is believed that the dynamics on a larger scale may , in principle , be obtained by an averaging procedure over the dynamics on the underlying smaller scale in case this dynamics is known .",
    "what one would like to have is an explicit connection between two different levels , characterized by length scales @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath2 , where , in particular , @xmath1 may be of the order of the homogeneity scale . assuming the cosmological evolution to be governed by gr , the question arises , on which scale einstein s equations will be valid .",
    "the safest starting point may be the solar - system scale since the validity of gr on this scale is established with high precision .",
    "generally , if we consider gr to be valid on a scale @xmath0 then , because of its nonlinearity , it is certainly no longer valid after an averaging procedure which is expected to account for the physics on a scale @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", this is true if we consider the transition to a spatially homogeneous description at a scale @xmath3 from an underlying inhomogeneous one for @xmath4 .",
    "the buchert equations are an approach to perform this step @xcite . starting from an irrotational pressureless matter distribution , the spatial average of the inhomogeneous dynamics over a certain rest mass preserving domain @xmath5 results in a set of equations for the domain dependent volume scale factor @xmath6 which depends on time and on the parameters of the domain @xmath5 .",
    "this quantity @xmath6 is defined through the time dependent domain volume @xmath7 by @xmath8 .",
    "the equations for @xmath6 have the structure of the friedmann and acceleration equations of standard cosmology but they do not rely on a homogeneous and isotropic background and @xmath6 is not the scale factor of a robertson - walker ( rw ) metric since , through the averaging operation , the scale factor must be scale - dependent .",
    "however , compared with the equations for a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe there appear additional terms as a consequence of the averaging process : a kinematical backreaction and an averaged curvature term .",
    "these terms are related by a consistency condition . in their absence one",
    "recovers the dynamics of an einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe .    in several applications in the literature buchert",
    "s equations are considered together with a supposed power - law behavior of the backreaction quantities in terms of the volume scale factor @xmath6 @xcite . on this basis",
    "the dynamics may be solved in terms of @xmath6 .",
    "the possible emergence of an effective bulk viscous pressure through backreaction has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "but as already mentioned , it is desirable to establish a direct connection between the averaged variables and the underlying inhomogeneous dynamics . assuming the existence of an exact solution at the level with characteristic scale @xmath0",
    ", the additional terms due to kinematical backreaction and averaged curvature on the level with characteristic scale @xmath2 are then , in principle , directly calculable .",
    "we exemplify this strategy here on the basis of the ltb solution for dust in the hyperbolic case , using a small - curvature approximation with a generally inhomogeneous bang time .",
    "we do not specify from the outset the size of the averaging domain .",
    "one expects that it should be of the order of the homogeneity scale . as a result",
    "we obtain the time dependence of the effective scale factor and we quantify the difference to the pure dust case of an eds universe . the volume scale factor @xmath6 is directly obtained from the expression for the averaging volume which we assume to be a sphere of radius @xmath9 .",
    "also the average curvature and the kinematical backreaction are directly and independently calculated from the mentioned ltb solution .",
    "buchert s equation are then not , as for power - law ansatzes for the average curvature and the kinematical backreaction , equations to determine @xmath6 but they become identities or consistency relations .",
    "the curvature function of the ltb metric , taken at the radius of the averaging region , directly determines the average curvature quantity in buchert s equations .",
    "the ltb curvature function also determines the deviation of the volume scale factor from the scale factor of the pure dust case .",
    "we demonstrate that the kinematic backreaction is zero in linear order in the curvature unless the bang time is inhomogeneous .",
    "also in second order in the curvature the backreaction vanishes for a homogeneous bang time . in our simple linearized configuration the effective hubble rate in terms of the volume scale factor",
    "is found to be of the structure of the simplest phenomenological solution of buchert s equations in which the parameters are given by the quantities of the underlying ltb solution at the surface of the averaging region .    to relate this formalism to observations , a further ingredient is required .",
    "the averaging procedure over spacelike hypersurfaces leaves open the question of how light propagates .",
    "there does not exist a space - time metric to which the usual condition @xmath10 for light propagation could be applied . a provisional way to handle",
    "this problem has been to assume the existence of a template metric @xcite in which the volume scale factor is supposed to play the same rle as the scale factor does in the metric of flrw models , although this template metric is not required to be a solution of the field equations .",
    "moreover , one assumes that the averaged curvature can be described by a curvature term in the template metric . on this basis",
    "several standard techniques for observational tests can be adapted to the averaged dynamics .",
    "while our ltb based model may be too simple for an adequate description of the real universe , we believe that it is nevertheless useful as an exactly solvable toy model .",
