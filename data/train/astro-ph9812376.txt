    "the present authors ( itoh , kohyama , & nozawa 1998 ; nozawa , itoh , & kohyama 1998 ) have recently given accurate relativistic corrections to the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effects ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1972,1980a , 1980b , 1981 ) .",
    "their method was based on the kinetic equation for the photon distribution function using a relativistically covariant formalism ( berestetskii , lifshitz , & pitaevskii 1982 ; buchler & yueh 1976 ) . by using the generalized kompaneets equation ( kompaneets 1957 ; weymann 1965 ) , they have derived analytic expressions for the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effects as a power series of @xmath1 = @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron temperature and @xmath3 is the peculiar velocity of the cluster divided by the velocity of light .",
    "it has been shown by several groups ( stebbins 1997 ; challinor & lasenby 1998 ; itoh , kohyama , & nozawa 1998 ) that the results for the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect obtained by the power series expansion agree with the previous numerical calculations by rephaeli ( 1995 ) and by rephaeli & yankovitch ( 1997 ) , thereby proving the validity of their method .",
    "in particular , the convergence of the power series expansion has been carefully studied in the paper by itoh , kohyama , & nozawa ( 1998 ) , where the analytic expressions up to @xmath5 have been derived and the results have been compared with those of the direct numerical integration of the boltzmann equation .",
    "it has been shown that the power series expansion approximation is sufficiently accurate for the region @xmath6kev by taking into account up to @xmath5 contributions .    in the paper by nozawa ,",
    "itoh , & kohyama ( 1998 ) , a formalism for the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect for the clusters of galaxies with a peculiar velocity @xmath3 has been derived by applying the lorentz boost to the standard formalism of the extended kompaneets equation . with the power series expansion approximation in terms of the electron temperature @xmath1 and the peculiar velocity @xmath3 , an analytic expression for the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect which includes the relativistic corrections of up to",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 has been derived .",
    "it has been found that the relativistic correction is significant .",
    "similar works have been reported by sazonov & sunyaev ( 1998 ) , and also by challinor & lasenby ( 1999 ) .",
    "they are in essential agreement with the works of the present authors .    in the present paper",
    "we address ourselves to the problem of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) caused by the proper motion of the cluster of galaxies .",
    "this problem has been studied by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1980b ) in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "the polarization sunyaev - zeldovich effect enables the measurement of the tangential velocities of the clusters of galaxies , thus contributing to the measurement of the radial velocities complemented by the measurement of the velocities along the line of sight which is achieved by means of the observation of the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "there exist , however , competing polarization effects connected with the finite depth of the intracluster plasma .",
    "these effects have been discussed by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1980b ) , and more recently by sazonov & sunyaev ( 1999 ) . in the present paper",
    "we solve this problem by extending our already - established formalism to the case of polarized photons . with the present formalism",
    "the effect of the polarization of the cmbr can be derived on the same footing as the calculation of the thermal and kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effects .",
    "we thereby take into account the relativistic corrections accurately .",
    "after the submittal of the original manuscript of the present paper to the astrophysical journal , we became aware of the similar works by audit & simmons ( 1998 ) as well as by hansen & lilje ( 1999 ) .",
    "more recently the papers by sazonov & sunyaev ( 1999 ) and by challinor , ford & lasenby ( 1999 ) have been submitted on the similar subject ( the polarization of the cmbr ) . through the communication with these authors , we have benefited a lot and have revised the present paper . in particular , dr .",
    "challinor has kindly pointed out an error in the original manuscript of the present paper . in the present revised manuscript ,",
    "we have fully taken into account their comments and have corrected the error in the original manuscript . with the present formalism",
    "we have confirmed the recent result obtained by challinor , ford & lasenby ( 1999 ) with an entirely different method as well as the nonrelativistic limit obtained by sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1980b ) .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : the kompaneets equation for polarized photons will be derived in @xmath9 2 .",
    "results of the calculation will be presented in @xmath9 3 .",
    "concluding remarks will be given in @xmath9 4 .",
    "in the present section we will extend the kompaneets equation studied by nozawa , itoh , & kohyama ( 1998 ) to the case of polarized photons .",
    "we will consider a cluster of galaxies moving with a peculiar velocity with respect to the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) .",
    "we will formulate the kinetic equation for the photon distribution function using a relativistically covariant formalism ( berestetskii , lifshitz , & pitaevskii 1982 ; buchler & yueh 1976 ) . as a reference system , we choose the system which is fixed to cmbr . the @xmath10-axis is fixed to the line connecting the cluster of galaxies ( cg ) and the observer .",

    "for simplicity , we choose the direction of the velocity in the @xmath12-@xmath10 plane , i.e. @xmath13 .    in order to describe the compton scattering of polarized photons by unpolarized electrons , we derive the stokes parameters using the polarization density matrix ( berestetskii , lifshitz , & pitaevskii ( 1982 ) ) .",
    "we here emphasize the importance of using the relativistically covariant formalism .",
    "sunyaev & zeldovich ( 1980b ) have shown that the degree of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background photon caused by the proper motion of the cluster of galaxies is of order @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , nozawa , itoh , & kohyama ( 1998 ) have derived the relativistic corrections to the kinematical sunyaev - zeldovich effect which are of order @xmath14 .",
