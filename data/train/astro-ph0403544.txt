    "qso absorption lines , including damped ly-@xmath24 absorbers ( dlas ) , and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are currently our two major sources of information on high redshift galaxies .",

    "hints to the nature of dlas are given by numerical @xcite and semi - analytical @xcite simulations of galaxy formation at high - redshifts .",

    "@xcite , and @xcite arrived to the same conclusions . from the chemical evolution point of view",
    ", @xcite argued that dlas are caused by gas rich low surface brightness dwarf galaxies , as seen locally in at least one case @xcite .",
    "however , dlas show asymmetric profiles of their high ionization species @xcite .",
    "this has been used to argue that dlas are , in fact , due to thick massive rotating disks @xcite .",
    "but others , e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , showed that a large range of morphologies can reproduce the observed kinematics : dlas can arise from the combined effect of a massive central galaxy and a number of smaller satellites or filaments .",
    "in fact , cold gas accretion along filaments could be an important mechanism , especially at high redshifts @xcite .    whether or not dlas are indeed massive will lead to different clustering properties of the galaxies around them . in hierarchical galaxy formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , this clustering yields a measurement of the dark matter halo mass associated with dlas relative to that of the galaxies used as tracers of the large scale structure .",
    "in particular , if the galaxies are less ( more ) correlated with the dlas than with themselves , this will imply that the halos of dlas are less ( more ) massive than those of the galaxies . here , we use @xmath32 lbgs @xcite as tracers of the large scale structure .    in analyses similar to that presented here",
    ", @xcite found no clustering of galaxies around one single dla at @xmath33 towards br 0951 - 04 , and @xcite found a lack of galaxies near four dlas ( they found two within a cylinder of radius of @xmath34mpc and depth @xmath35 whereas @xmath36 were expected if the cross - correlation is the same as the galaxy auto - correlation ) .",
    "they argued that this is evidence that dlas and lbgs `` do not reside in the same parts of the universe '' .",
    "it is important to note that both of these studies were not sensitive to scales larger than 5@xmath37  mpc because because of the small field of view available .",
    "other studies , however , have pointed to an over - density of galaxies near dlas .",

    "we imaged our three fields through four broad - band filters ",
    "u ( stromgren ) and bv&i ( harris set ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : filters]) using a standard dither pattern ( five pointings ) to remove cosmic rays and detector defects . the total integration time for each field was typically 4hr(u ) , 1hr(b & v ) and 4hr(i ) ; the observations are summarized in table  [ table : observations ] .",
    "in addition , we observed several landolt ( 1992 ) standard star fields through each filter .",
    "the data were reduced with the package mscred ( v4.1 ) within iraf(v2.11.3 ) , following the reductions guidelines of the noao deep wide - field survey @xcite .",
    "this package was specifically designed to reduce mosaic data .",
    "the reduction process contains more steps than typical optical observations and is detailed here .",
    "we first performed the overscan level subtraction .",
    "we then corrected for the small correction ( @xmath770.5% ) due to cross talk between adjacent chips .",
    "for each night s data , we removed an averaged zero frame , or bias frames , from the science images .",
    "the thinned mosaic chips required no dark correction since the dark current was only 5@xmath78 per hour .    flat - fielding is critical to achieve precise photometry .",
    "however , we had to deal with two non - traditional complications : ( i ) the mosaic instrument at the 4-m suffers from a ghost image of the pupil in all bands due to reflections in the optics of the camera that needs to be removed ; and ( ii ) dome flat - fields may match the night sky to only 1 or 2% ( usually larger ) .",
    "thus , sky - flatfielding in addition to dome - flatfielding was necessary and since the pupil image is an additive light effect , it has to be removed from the flat - fields first .    in the dome flats",
    ", we removed the pupil image by fitting an axially symmetric pattern to the data themselves with the task mscpupil .",
    "we then flat - fielded all the science frames with pupil - free dome - flats .    at this point ,",
    "the pupil image was still present in the data .",
    "it is more difficult to remove the pupil from individual science images than from the dome - flats because the pupil pattern is much fainter , and the pupil image is mixed with all the faint and bright sources in the data .",
    "a simple threshold scheme to remove the objects is not feasible since the pupil is still present and the data poorly flat - fielded .",
    "thus , to remove the pupil from the science images and to make the sky - flats , we had to extract the pupil image from the science images themselves through the following iterative steps : ( i ) we created a sky - flat ( ver .",
    "1 ) from the average of the science frames with a median rejection ; ( ii ) we extracted the pupil image from the sky - flat ( ver .",
    "1 ) using the task mscpupil ( parameter ` type ' set to ` data ' ) and removed it from the science frames with rmpupil to produce a ` first - pass ' pupil - free data ; ( iii ) we created another sky - flat ( ver .",
    "2 ) using the pupil - free data and applied it to the data .",
    "we found that low - level light from bright stars was creating signal in the sky - flat even if strong min - max rejection was used . to solve this problem , we created object masks by using a @xmath79 threshold on each of the eight ccds and masked out large areas around the brightest objects . steps ( i ) through ( iii ) were repeated using the masks and the final sky - flat was normalized and applied to all the frames . for the i - band",
    "only , we removed fringing using the procedure in @xcite before applying the final sky - flat .",
    "cosmic ray removal was done using the task xzap from the package dimsum and customized routines .",
    "bad - pixel masks including the cosmic rays and bleeding regions were constructed .",
    "de - projecting the 8 ccds on a single image is a two step process and requires very good astrometry .",
    "first , using the coordinates of several hundred usno stars , we interactively derived astrometric solutions ( rms @xmath80 ) with msccmatch for each dithered exposure .",
    "then , we mapped the eight ccds onto a single image by rebinning the pixels to a tangent - plane projection , thus producing pixels of constant angular size , with the task mscimage .",
    "this process matches the world coordinate solution ( wcs ) solution of all bands to a common reference position .",
    "the individual flat - fielded , astrometrically calibrated images with a uniform zero - point were averaged with an average sigma - clipping rejection to produce the final stacked images .",
    "the scaling of each individual dithered image was performed interactively on @xmath81 astrometric calibration stars common to all images .    for the i - band of run",
    "ii , we were not able to achieve a satisfactory sky - flatfielding(residuals @xmath47% ) . in order to correct for this , we applied a median filtering to a block - averaged image of the stacked frame and applied the normalized results to the image .    even though all bands were deprojected to a tangent - plane solution using the same position and orientation on the sky ,",
    "the relative pixel positions of objects in the different bands were not exactly identical because of dithering and effects such as flexure of the telescope , and optical distortions due to filters .",
    "since it is important to have identical pixel positions for the photometry , we had to register and rotate slightly ( @xmath82  deg ) each image with respect to the reference band ( @xmath83 ) using @xmath84 stellar objects with high s / n in all bands throughout the field of view .",
    "the rms in the relative astrometry of @xmath85 stellar objects with @xmath86 and @xmath87mag is typically @xmath88  pix throughout the field .",
    "the standard star frames , which contained @xmath85 @xcite standard stars observed through each filter and airmasses @xmath89 , were reduced the same way , including the rebinning of the pixels to a tangent - plane projection .",
    "for run i , because only a handful of standard stars were available , we tied the photometric solution of run i against run ii on the apm 08279 + 5255 field , which was re - observed in run ii .",
    "total fluxes of the standard stars were measured by fitting a @xcite profile ( similar to the 7aperture flux used by landolt 1992 at the 0.015 mag level ) .",

    "we achieved a flux limit of typically ( m@xmath95 ) 25.5mag ( @xmath96 ) in a @xmath97fwhm diameter aperture ( see table  [ table : depth ] for all the flux limits ) .",

    "the magnitude in that band is set to the @xmath103 flux limit in a @xmath97fwhm diameter aperture and no color term is computed ( equation  1 ) .    in the remainder of this paper , we use aperture magnitudes . to convert those to total magnitudes",
    ", we estimate the total magnitude correction for star - like objects to be @xmath104fwhm@xmath105 in the i - band , calibrated by adding simulated stars with known total flux into our images and measuring the recovered flux in the chosen aperture .",

    "thus , we reached a depth sufficient to ensure that we sample well @xmath113 galaxies at @xmath6 .      from our catalog of @xmath117 objects , we rejected objects close to the field edges and objects with a fwhm_image less than 0.85% the fwhm for stellar objects , presumably cosmic rays or bad pixels .",

    "we did not perform any star - galaxy separation since beyond @xmath122mag , number counts are dominated by the faint galaxies at those magnitudes .",
    "however , we determined empirically the stellar contamination at faint magnitudes the following way .",
    "we first select point sources , i.e. those with fwhm of the source @xmath123fwhm of seeing , up to @xmath124mag and that fall in our color selection box ( eq .  [ eq : colorcut ] ) .",
    "we then select all the lbg candidates with @xmath125mag that have a probability to be at @xmath126 greater than 50% , from our photometric redshifts ( see below ) .",
    "this subset contains some of the point sources between @xmath127mag and @xmath128mag , namely those with colors consistent with being at @xmath115 .",
    "finally , we compare the number counts of the lbg candidates with that of the point sources that have @xmath49 colors and extrapolate the counts at @xmath129 to @xmath130mag , assuming the counts to be constant at @xmath129mag ( a conservative assumption given that the star counts almost certainly decreases from @xmath127mag to @xmath128mag ) .",
    "we found the stellar contamination to be @xmath131% , @xmath132% and @xmath133% for the apm 08279 + 5255 , the pc 1233 + 4752 , and the j0124 + 0044 field , respectively .",
    "following our rough color - cuts , we used photometric redshift techniques to select lbg candidates in narrow redshift slices .",
    "there are two approaches to photometric redshift estimations : the empirical training set method ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> the large area of the mosaic images , 0.31 @xmath4 or @xmath5  mpc co - moving at redshift @xmath6 , allows us to probe the clustering of lbgs on scales up to 20  mpc co - moving . </S>",
    "<S> our survey covers a total of 1 deg@xmath7 and contains @xmath83,000 lbgs with photometric redshifts between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . using the redshift likelihood distributions with @xmath11 as a prior , we selected lbgs within a redshift slice of width @xmath12 ( corresponding to @xmath13 , the uncertainty in photometric redshifts ) centered on the redshift of the absorbers . within that redshift slice , we find that the dla - lbg cross - correlation @xmath14 is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the lbg auto - correlation . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a correlation length of @xmath17 ( co - moving ) ( or @xmath18  mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation is most significant on scales @xmath19  mpc . through monte carlo simulations , we find that @xmath14 is significantly greater than zero at the @xmath20% level . in three other redshift slices that do not contain a dla </S>",
    "<S> , we do not find any evidence of clustering . a larger sample will enable us to discriminate between @xmath21 @xmath22 or @xmath21 @xmath23 , i.e to test whether dla halos are more or less massive than lbg halos . </S>"
