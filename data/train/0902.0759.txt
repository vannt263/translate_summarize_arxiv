    "the methodology explained in @xcite , we have computed synthetic @xmath3 band profiles for the observing conditions of 71p / clark and c/2004 b1 ( linear ) from _ spitzer _ and the field - of - view corresponding to the extraction apertures .",
    "effective @xmath13 were derived by fitting the synthetic spectra with the same procedure as used for the observed spectra .    for 71p / clark , the predicted effective @xmath13 at 8  from the nucleus is 1112  k for a kinetic temperature @xmath92 in the range 1050  k and @xmath93 = 1 , where @xmath93 is a multiplying factor to the electron density normalized to the giotto 1p / halley measurements .",
    "if our observations had been executed with the slit centered on the nucleus , we would have expected @xmath13 = 25 to 29  k with these model parameters .",
    "these results are for an aperture of 3.7@xmath44 17.9 , but similar numbers are obtained for a 3.7@xmath44 5.6  aperture : 3139 k on nucleus , 1213  k for an offset of 8 .",
    "the size of the collisional region where water molecules are thermalized to the gas kinetic temperature is small with respect to the field of view , hence the predicted rotational temperature is weakly sensitive to the assumed @xmath92 .",
    "a relatively high @xmath13 is expected for a slit centered on the nucleus because molecules excited by collisions with hot electrons have a significant contribution to the signal .",
    "rotational temperatures measured in 71p / clark ( 14 @xmath86 4  k and 5 @xmath86 13  k for the small and large apertures , respectively ) are consistent with modeling .",
    "model calculations pertaining to the observational circumstances of the c/2004 b1 ( linear ) pre - perihelion data predict @xmath13 = 1719  k for a 3.7@xmath44 17.9  aperture and kinetic temperatures of 10 to 50 k. note that low gas temperatures may be expected for this weakly active (   [ sec : qh2o ] ) comet observed at 2.12.2 au from the sun .",
    "overall , the agreement with the measured @xmath13 value ( 13.6 @xmath86 2.1 k ) is satisfactory .    in the case of c/2004 b1 ( linear ) post - perihelion , the expected @xmath13 for a 3.7@xmath44 17.9  extraction centered on the nucleus is @xmath13 = 17  k assuming @xmath94  k , with little dependency on the assumed @xmath92 since water molecules with non - lte rotational populations are sampled .",
    "the measured @xmath13 of 23 @xmath86 4  k is consistent with the model within 2-@xmath59 .",
    "a better agreement could be obtained by increasing the electron density through the @xmath95 parameter .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio of @xmath96 measured in c/2004 b1 ( linear ) corresponds to a spin temperature @xmath97 = @xmath8  k. the ortho - to - para ratio in water has been measured in a dozen of comets ( see * ? ? ? * for a compilation of measurements before 2007 ) , and ranges from @xmath20 1.8 to the equilibrated value of 3 ( @xmath97 from @xmath20 23 to @xmath98 40 k ) .",
    "the opr measured in c/2004  b1 ( linear ) is in the low range of measured values in oort cloud comets , yet comparable to opr values reported by @xcite and @xcite for comets 1p / halley and c/2001 a2 ( linear ) .",
    "our new measurement for c/2004  b1 ( linear ) suggests that opr variation clearly exists among the population of oort cloud comets .",
    "the meaning of nuclear spin temperatures in cometary molecules is puzzling @xcite .",
    "nuclear spin temperatures may be related to the thermal conditions experienced by the molecules since their incorporation into cometary nuclei , or connected to their formation conditions and subsequent opr reequilibration in the solar nebula . @xcite",
    "have shown that there is no clear trend between the nuclear spin temperatures , production rate , heliocentric distance and orbital period of the comet , suggesting that the nuclear spin temperature is pristine @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the opr ( and corresponding nuclear spin temperature ) in c/2004 b1 ( linear ) is derived from observations conducted when the comet was at a heliocentric distance , @xmath77 = 2.21 au .",
    "this heliocentric distance is intermediate between the range @xmath77 = 0.81.2 au , where most opr measurements were acquired , and the measurement in c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) at 2.9 au from the sun .",
    "our _ spitzer _ measurement provides a new data point for future investigations of @xmath97 variations with heliocentric distance based on a statistically significant data set .",
    "the modeled water spectrum wholly accounts for the emission in excess of the dust continuum background in the two comets ( figs .",
    "[ fig:71pfit ] and  [ fig : post-2004b1fit ] ) .",
    "there is no emission excess at 6.2   that could be attributed to pah emission .",
    "there is not significant evidence for moderately broad ( @xmath99  ) emission peaking at 7.0   ( arising from asymmetric stretching vibration of c  o ) that could be due to carbonates minerals @xcite . such emission , if present , would have made the 6.85   peak of the h@xmath12o band of less contrast than observed .",
    "in addition if carbonates where present , other narrow ( @xmath100  ) emission features near 12.7   and 14.8   should be present @xcite .",
    "the irs spectra of comets c/2004  b1 ( linear ) and 71p / clark over this wavelength interval are featureless , fig .",
    "[ fig : carbonates ] .",
    "thus , carbonates are not present ( or significantly abundant ) in the comet comae created through quiescent sublimation processes or dermal jets from isolated active areas on the nucleus based on analysis of _ spitzer _ spectra of three comets .",
    "excess emission is present at 7.17.3   in the spectrum of 71p / clark , and between 7.15 and 7.45  , peaking at 7.32   in the post - perihelion spectrum of c/2004 b1 ( linear ) ( figs .",
    "[ fig:71pfit ] and  [ fig : post-2004b1fit ] ) .",
    "excess emission near 7.3   was also observed in the _ spitzer _ spectrum of c/2003 k4 ( linear ) @xcite .",
    "the emission feature observed in c/2004 b1 ( linear ) post - perihelion closely resembles that observed for c/2003 k4 ( linear ) , but is much more intense relative to the intensity of the water band than in c/2003 k4 ( linear ) : @xmath20 10% the intensity of the water band in the post - perihelion spectrum of c/2004 b1 ( linear ) , @xmath20 2% in c/2003 k4 ( linear ) @xcite .",
    "its contrast with respect to the continuum background is also more important in c/2004 b1 ( linear ) .",
    "the feature is not present in the pre - perihelion spectrum of c/2004 b1 ( linear ) .",
    "this suggests that the feature is not related to the absolute brightness of the comet . as discussed in @xcite , the origin of this feature",
    "is unclear . based on examination of spectral extractions of standard stars used to calibrate the irs campaign ,",
    "this feature is not likely an instrumental artifact , although we can not completely exclude this possibility .",
    "we have presented _ spitzer _ irs spectra of the water @xmath3 fundamental vibrational band near 6.5   in the jupiter - family comet 71p / clark and the dynamically new comet c/2004  b1 ( linear ) .",
    "modeling of the ir spectra using a fluorescence model of the water emission yielded rotational temperature and production rate measurements .",
    "the measured low rotational temperatures are consistent with water excitation models which predict that water molecules within the _ spitzer _ irs slit have partially relaxed ( non - lte ) rotational populations .",
    "the water ortho - to - para ratio ( opr ) was constrained to @xmath7 in c/2004  b1 ( linear ) from its pre - perihelion spectrum observed with a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the corresponding spin temperature @xmath97 = @xmath8  k is in the low range of measured values in other oort cloud comets .",
    "in addition , the spatial distributon of water observed ( pre - perihelion ) in the northern coma of c/2004 b1 ( linear ) is more extended than that expected for nucleus outgassing which suggests the presence of subliming icy grains .",
    "although the 5.87.6   spectral domain is rich in spectral signatures of gaseous compounds and minerals our spectra show no incontrovertible evidence for carbonates , or pah emission .",
    "thus , reported claims that these astrobiologically significant species are present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) remain controversial ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
