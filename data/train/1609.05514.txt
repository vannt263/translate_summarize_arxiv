    "characterising the statistical properties of individual trajectories is necessary to understand the underlying dynamics of human mobility and design reliable predictive models .",
    "a trajectory consists of _ displacements _ between locations and _ pauses _ at locations , where the individual stops and spends time ( figure  [ trajectory ] ) .",
    "thus , the distribution of waiting times ( or pause durations ) , @xmath3 , between movements and the distribution of distances , @xmath4 , travelled between pauses are often used to quantitatively assess the dynamics of human mobility .",
    "for example , specific probability distributions of distances and waiting times characterise different types of diffusion processes .",
    "thanks to the recent availability of data used as proxy for human trajectories including mobile phone call records ( cdr ) , location based social networks ( lbsn ) data , and gps trajectories of vehicles , the characteristic distributions of distances and waiting times between consecutive locations have been widely investigated .",
    "there is no agreement , however , on which distribution best describes these empirical datasets .",
    "pioneer studies , based on cdr  @xcite and banknote records  @xcite , found that the distribution of displacement @xmath4 is well approximated by a truncated power law , @xmath5 , ( or ` lvy distribution'@xcite , as typically @xmath6 ) .",
    "this finding was confirmed by studies based on gps trajectories of individuals  @xcite and vehicles  @xcite , as well as online social networks data  @xcite .",
    "it has been noted , however , that power - law behaviour may fail to describe intra - urban displacements  @xcite .",
    "other analyses , based on online social network data  @xcite and gps trajectories  @xcite showed that the distribution of displacements is well fitted by an exponential curve , @xmath7 , in particular at short distances .",
    "finally , analyses based on public transpotation travel cards  @xcite and gps on taxis  @xcite suggested that displacements may also obey log - normal distributions , @xmath8 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors found that this is the case also for single - transportation trips .",
    "fewer studies have explored the distribution of waiting times between displacements , @xmath3 , as trajectory sampling is often uneven ( e.g. , in cdr data location is recorded only when the phone user makes a call or texts , and lbsn data include the positions of individuals who actively  check - in \" at specific places ) .",
    "analyses based on evenly sampled trajectories from mobile phone call records  @xcite , and individuals gps trajectories  @xcite found that the distribution of waiting times can be also approximated by a power law . a recent study based on gps trajectories of vehicles , however , suggests that for waiting times larger than @xmath9 hours , this distribution is best approximated by a log - normal function  @xcite .",
    "several studies have highlighted the presence of natural temporal scales in individual routines : distributions of waiting times display peaks in that corresponds to the typical times spent home on a typical day ( @xmath10  hours ) and at work ( @xmath11  hours for a part - time job and @xmath12  hours for a full - time job)@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_ranges ] and table [ thetable ] compare distributions obtained using different data sources .",
    "the spectrum of results reflects the heterogeneity of the considered datasets ( see figure  [ fig_ranges ] ) .",
    "it is known in fact that data spatio - temporal resolution and coverage has an important influence on the results of the analyses performed @xcite .",
    "first , the datasets considered have different _ spatial resolution and coverage _ , and few studies have so far considered the whole range of displacements occurring between @xmath2 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) ( figure  [ fig_ranges ] ) .",
    "our analysis suggests that constraining the analysis to a specific distance range may result in different interpretations of the distributions .",
    "another difference concerns the _ temporal sampling _ in the datasets analysed so far .",
    "uneven sampling typical of cdr and lbsn data ( i ) does not allow to distinguish phases of _ displacement _ and _ pause _ , since individuals could be active also while transiting between locations , and ( ii ) may fail to capture patterns other than regular ones  @xcite , because individuals voice - call / sms / data activity may be higher in certain preferred locations .",
    "finally , studies focusing on displacements effectuated using one or several _ specific transportation modality _ ( private car  @xcite , taxi  @xcite , public transportation  @xcite , or walk  @xcite ) capture only a specific aspect of human mobility behaviour .    :",
    "heterogeneity of results found in the literature * each horizontal line corresponds to a different dataset .",
    "lines extend from the minimum @xmath4 ( _ i.e. _ the spatial resolution of the data or the minimum value considered for the fit of the distribution ) , to the maximal length of displacement considered ( both in meters ) .",
    "colours correspond to the model fitting @xmath15 according to the study reported at the end of each line .",
    "if the distribution is not unique , but varies for different ranges of @xmath4 , the line is divided in segments .",
    "lines are marked with *",
    "if the corresponding data is modelled as a sequence of two distributions of the same type with different parameters , for different ranges @xmath4 .",
    "refs @xcite analyse more than one dataset . in @xcite",
    "the authors analyse the same dataset for different ranges @xmath4 .",
    "a more detailed table is presented in section  related work \" . ]    in this paper , we analyse mobility patterns of @xmath16 individuals involved in the copenhagen network study experiment for over @xmath17  years  @xcite .",
    "individual trajectories are determined combining gps and wi - fi scans data resulting in a spatial resolution of @xmath18 , and even sampling every @xmath19 .",
    "trajectories span more than @xmath20 .",
    "previous studies with comparable spatial coverage ( figure  [ fig_ranges ] ) relied on single - transportation modality data  @xcite , unevenly sampled data  @xcite , or small samples ( 32 individuals in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "the copenhagen network study data has the best combination of spatio - temporal resolution and sample size among the datasets analysed in the literature to date ( see methods ) .",
    "we consider an individual to be _ pausing _ when he / she spends at least 10 consecutive minutes in the same location , and _ moving _ in the complementary case . in the following ,",
    "we refer to _ locations _ as places where individuals pause .",
    "the distribution of displacements is robust with respect to variations of this definition ( see appendix ) .",
    "we start by considering the three distributions most frequently reported in the literature ( table  [ thetable ] ) , namely    * _ the log - normal distribution _ of a random variable @xmath21 , with parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , defined for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with probability density function : @xmath26 * _ the pareto distribution _",

    "the shift and scale parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are considered as additional parameters of the models .",
    "we start our analysis by investigating the distribution of displacements between consecutive stop - locations @xmath15 .",
    "first , we consider the overall distribution of the displacements @xmath4 using all available data ( 851 individuals over 25 months ) . we find that @xmath15 is best described by a log - normal distribution ( equation [ eq : lognorm ] ) with parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which maximises akaike information criterion ( see methods )  among the three models considered  with akaike weight @xmath44 ( figure  [ distance_between_locations ] ) .",
    "second , we investigate if this results holds also for sub - samples of the entire dataset .",
    "we bootstrap data @xmath45 times for samples of @xmath46 and @xmath47 individuals , and we verify that the best distribution is log - normal for all samples , and the average parameters inferred through the bootstrapping procedure are consistent with the parameters found for the entire dataset ( see the appendix ) .",
    "in fact , the errors on the value of the parameters reported above are computed by bootstrapping data for samples of @xmath47 randomly selected individuals .",
    "this analysis ensures homogeneity within the population considered , and takes into account also that often smaller sample sizes were analysed in previous literature .",
    "third , we zoom in to the individual level .",
    "we find that the individual distribution of displacements is best described by a log - normal function for @xmath48 of individuals .",
    "the best distribution is the pareto distribution for @xmath49 , and exponential for the remaining @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig_individuals ] reports the histogram of the individual @xmath23 parameters for the @xmath48 of the population that is best described by a log - normal distribution , along with three examples of individual distributions .    finally , we look at large @xmath4 in order to compare our results with precedent studies relying on data with larger spatial resolution .",
    "we find that limiting the analysis to large values of @xmath4 results in the selection of a pareto distribution ( equation [ eq : pareto ] ) .",
    "we identify the threshold @xmath51 as the minimal resolution for which the best fit in @xmath52 is pareto with coefficient @xmath53 and not log - normal . by bootstrapping @xmath45 times over samples of @xmath47 individuals",
    "we find that @xmath54 .",

    "we now analyse the distribution of waiting times between displacements .",
    "the best model describing the distribution of waiting times over all individuals is the log - normal distribution ( equation [ eq : lognorm ] , figure  [ waiting_times between locations ] ) , with parameters @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "as above , errors are found by bootstrapping over samples of @xmath47 individuals .",
    "also , by bootstrapping we find that the log - normal distribution is the best descriptor for samples of 200 and 100 randomly selected individuals ( see appendix ) . as in the case of displacements , we find that restricting the analysis to large values of our observable @xmath3 , and specifically considering only @xmath62 , results in the selection of the pareto distribution ( equation [ eq : pareto ] , see figure  [ waiting_times between locations ] ) , with coefficient @xmath63 .",
    "we find by averaging over 100 samples of 200 individuals that @xmath64 .",
    "note that the log - normal distribution is selected as the best model also when the analysis is restricted to @xmath65 .",
    "the distribution of waiting times shows also the existence of  natural time - scales \" of human mobility .",
    "we detect local maxima of the distribution at 14.0 , 39.3 , 64.8 , and 89.9 hours .",
    "hence , 14 hours is the typical amount of time that students in the experiment spent home every day , in agreement with previous analyses on human mobility  @xcite .",
    "other peaks appear for intervals @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , suggesting individuals spend several days at home .",
    "notice also that the distribution we consider is limited to @xmath68 days , an interval much shorter than the observation time - window ( about 2 years ) , a fact that guarantees the absence of possible spurious effects@xcite .     and @xmath22 .",

    "log - normal features also characterise patterns of _ exploration_. we consider the temporal sequence of stop - locations that individuals visit for the first time  in our observational window  and characterise the distributions of displacements between these ` discoveries ' .",
    "we find that the distribution of distances between consecutive discoveries @xmath15 is best described as a log - normal distribution with parameters @xmath70 , @xmath71 , ( figure  [ distance_between discoveries ] ) . for @xmath72 , the best model fitting the distribution of displacements is the pareto distribution with coefficient @xmath73 .",
    "this results are verified by bootstrapping ( see appendix ) .     and @xmath22 .",
    "red dashed line : pareto fit with characteristic parameter @xmath27 for @xmath72 . ]",
    "we further investigate the properties of individual trajectories by analysing the correlations between the distance @xmath4 and the duration @xmath74 characterising a displacement and the time @xmath3 spent at destination .",
    "we find a positive correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ correlations]a ) .",
    "as @xmath4 is the distance between the displacement origin and destination , the absence of correlation at short distances could be due to individuals not taking the fastest route .",
    "a positive correlation characterises also the distance @xmath4 covered between origin and destination and the waiting time at destination for distances @xmath76 .",
    "instead , the correlation is negative for distances larger than @xmath77 ( fig .",
    "[ correlations]b ) .",
    "this could suggest that individuals break long trips with short pauses .     of a displacement vs the distance @xmath4 between origin and destination .",

    "the filled area corresponds to the 25 - 75 percentile range . ]      in the previous sections we have restricted the analysis of the distributions of displacements and waiting times to the three functional forms that are most frequently found in the literature .",
    "we now repeat the selection procedure considering a list of 66 models with at most 3 parameters ( see appendix for the list of distributions ) in order to confirm the results described above .",
    "the distributions of displacements and displacements between discoveries are best described by log - normal distributions also when the choice is extended to 66 models , and tails ( respectively for @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) are better modelled as generalized pareto distribution , with form : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the parameters of the model , such that @xmath82 if @xmath83 , and @xmath84 if @xmath85 .",
    "the best model selected for the whole distribution of waiting time among the 66 models considered is a gamma distribution .",
    "however , the presence of natural scales could indicate that the whole distribution may be better described as the composition of several models .    using high resolution data",
    "we have characterised human mobility patterns across a wide range of scales .",
    "we have shown that both the distribution of displacements and waiting times between displacements are best described by a log - normal distribution .",
    "we found , however , that power - law distributions are selected as the best model when only large spatial or temporal scales are considered , thus explaining ( at least partially ) the disagreement between previous studies .",
    "we also showed that log - normal distributions characterise the distribution of displacements between discoveries , implying that this property is not a simple consequence of the stability of human mobility but a characteristic feature of human behaviour .",
    "finally , we have shown that there exist correlations between displacements length and the waiting time at destination .",
    "the heavy tailed nature of human mobility has been attributed to various factors , including differences between individual trajectories  @xcite , search optimization  @xcite , the hierarchical organization of the streets network  @xcite and of the transportation system  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand log - normal distributions can result from multiplicative  @xcite and additive  @xcite processes and describe the inter - event time of different human activities such as writing emails , commenting / voting on online content @xcite and creating friendship relations on online social networks  @xcite .",
    "instead , the distribution of inter - event time in mobile - phone call communication activity can be described as the composition of power - laws @xcite , a feature attributed to the existence of characteristic scales in communication activity such as the time needed to answer a call , as well as the existence of circadian , weakly and monthly patterns . while we also find clear signatures of circadian patterns , in our case the best description for times @xmath86 is again the log - normal distribution , which thus is selected both when the whole range of scales is considered and when the analysis is restricted to short times .",
    "while identifying the mechanism responsible for the observed mobility patterns is beyond the scope of the present article , we anticipate that a more complete spatio - temporal description of human mobility will help us develop better models of human mobility behaviour  @xcite .",
    "our findings can also help the understanding of phenomena such as the spreading of epidemics at different spatial resolutions , since the nature of heterogeneous waiting times between displacements have a major impact on the spreading of diseases  @xcite .",

    "<S> the recent availability of digital traces generated by phone calls and online logins has significantly increased the scientific understanding of human mobility . until now , however , limited data resolution and coverage have hindered a coherent description of human displacements across different spatial and temporal scales . </S>",
    "<S> here , we characterise mobility behaviour across several orders of magnitude by analysing @xmath0 individuals digital traces sampled every @xmath1  seconds for 25  months with @xmath2  meters spatial resolution . we show that the distributions of distances and waiting times between consecutive locations are best described by log - normal distributions and that natural time - scales emerge from the regularity of human mobility . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that log - normal distributions also characterise the patterns of discovery of new places , implying that they are not a simple consequence of the routine of modern life . </S>"
