    "the self  assembly of sub-@xmath0 m colloidal particles at fluid ( e.g. , water / air or water / oil ) interfaces has gained significant interest in view of various basic and applied issues such as the study of two  dimensional melting @xcite , investigations of mesoscale structure formation @xcite , and engineering of colloidal crystals on spherical surfaces @xcite .",
    "the colloidal particles are trapped at the interface if the fluid phases wet the colloid only partially ; this configuration is stable against thermal fluctuations and it appears to be even the global equilibrium state , in accordance with the experimental observation that the colloids immersed in the bulk phases are attracted towards the interface @xcite .    in order to prevent coagulation , the colloidal particles are electrically charged .",
    "the ensuing repulsive force is well understood and at large separations @xmath1 it varies like a dipole ",
    "dipole interaction @xmath2 , because the monopoles vanish due to screening by counterions in water @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several experimental findings have led to postulating an attractive effective force between such particles with a range much larger than that of van  der  waals forces @xcite ( but see also ref .  ) .",
    "spherical particles ( radii @xmath3 @xmath0 m ) at flat water  air interfaces exhibit the spontaneous formation of complicated metastable mesostructures consistent with the presence of a minimum in the effective intercolloidal potential at separations @xmath4 and with a depth of at least a few @xmath5 .    until now , no unequivocal explanation for the appearance of these relatively long  ranged attractions is available .",
    "one possibility , which has been explored intensively in previous years , consists of an attraction mediated by the deformation of the interface ( see fig .  [ fig:2coll_side ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the so - called flotation force attracting particles floating at the surface of water which is deformed by the weight of the particles @xcite .",
    "but gravity plays no role for micrometer sized particles as described above .",
    "instead , the electrostatic field around the charged colloids deforms the interface and gives rise to effective , capillary  induced interactions .",
    "there have been contradictory results about the properties of this effective interaction . in refs .",
    "it has been argued in favor of an attractive force decaying like @xmath6 ( similar to the gravity  induced flotation force ) . in refs .",
    "this line of thought was shown to be invalid because the decay turns out to be much faster if the physical system consisting of the colloidal particles plus the interface is mechanically isolated , i.e. , if the total force acting on this system vanishes in the limit of a macroscopically extended interface with negligible borders .",
    "this is in principle the case for the experiments conducted in langmuir troughs with lateral extensions several times the capillary length of the interface ( i.e. , orders of magnitude larger than the colloid radius ) . in this case",
    "the electrostatic force pulling on the interface is counterbalanced exactly by the electrostatic force pushing the particles into water .",
    "in particular , the authors of ref .",
    "argue for an attractive force decaying like @xmath7 .",
    "however , this was in turn corrected in refs .   and a repulsive force with an asymptotic decay @xmath8 was derived . in ref .",
    "it was noticed that this latter result is actually unreliable because the linear superposition approximation employed in these calculations is not valid if mechanical isolation holds .",
    "furthermore , since it is the electric field @xmath9 , and not the electrostatic pressure @xmath10 , which obeys a superposition principle , the superposition approximation will be unsuitable if the main contribution to the electrostatic pressure stems from cross terms in @xmath11 .",
    "this latter case was studied in refs .   with the conclusion that the capillary ",
    "induced force is attractive and decays like @xmath12 , which is the same asymptotic behavior as the direct dipole ",
    "dipole repulsion ; whether the capillary attraction overcomes the electric repulsion must then be determined by a detailed analysis of the electrostatic problem .",
    "the total force is repulsive in the regime of small deformations of a flat interface ( equivalent to the regime of small colloidal charges ) , for which the calculations were carried out @xcite . only for",
    "sufficiently large colloidal charges the capillary attraction may asymptotically overcome the electrostatic repulsion leading to a minimum in the total effective potential @xcite .",
    "however , further calculations  going beyond the linearization assumptions in treating the electrostatic pressure on the interface and the energy of the deformed interface  are necessary to substantiate this claim .",
    "the experiment described in ref .",
    "is peculiar in the sense that the unperturbed interface is actually that of a relatively small spherical droplet pending from a plate .",
    "the importance of this finite  size effect was studied in refs .  .",
    "in refs .",
    "it was found that the flotation  like decay @xmath6 is present because the plate breaks the condition of mechanical isolation , but it is quantitatively too small to explain the experimental observations .    here",
    "we follow the approach of ref .   in order to calculate the capillary  induced effective interaction beyond the superposition approximation in the case that there is a pressure field of general form @xmath13 acting on the interface in the limit of small deformations .",
    "the limit of small deformations corresponds to an analysis to leading order in the small dimensionless parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 , defined in eq .",

    "sec : theory ] we derive the exact leading  order expressions for the capillary potential and show in which respect the superposition approximation becomes inconsistent if mechanical isolation holds .",
