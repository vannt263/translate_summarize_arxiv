    "we give an algorithm to build all compact orientable atoroidal haken 3-manifolds with tori boundary and closed orientable haken 3-manifolds , so that in both cases , there are embedded closed orientable incompressible surfaces which are not tori .",
    "the algorithm can also be viewed as a decomposition result showing how such manifolds can be built from handlebodies and compression bodies with _",
    "suitable _ boundary patterns . given such a description ,",
    "many properties of the 3-manifolds can be deduced , such as estimates on the heegaard genus , annularity properties of incompressible surfaces etc . the original notion of haken manifold",
    "was introduced by haken in @xcite .",
    "next , we relate such incompressible surfaces to heegaard splittings . for separating incompressible surfaces ,",
    "the first step is to put the surfaces into morse position relative to the height function associated to the heegaard splittings .",
    "then a thin position method is applied so that levels are thin or thick , depending on the side of the surface .",
    "the thin levels can be viewed as incompressible spanning surfaces , i.e. , part of the hierarchy described in the earlier sections .",
    "so the complete description of the surface in terms of these thin / thick levels gives a hierarchy .",
    "the special case of heegaard genus 2 is treated as an illustration of the general theory .",
    "finally we relate this thin / thick description to properties of the curve complex for the heegaard surface .",
    "we give a very brief list of basic definitions and concepts . for more details of 3-manifold topology , see @xcite and on thin position see @xcite .",
    "we work throughout in the pl category and all manifolds , surfaces and maps are pl .",
    "a compact orientable 3-manifold is _ irreducible _ if every embedded 2-sphere bounds a 3-ball .",
    "a closed embedded orientable surface @xmath0 in a compact orientable 3-manifold is _ incompressible _ if @xmath0 is not a 2-sphere and the homomorphism induced by inclusion @xmath1 is one - to - one .",
    "a compact orientable irreducible 3-manifold @xmath2 is called _ atoroidal _ if the only embedded incompressible torus is parallel to a component of @xmath3 .",
    "a _ handlebody _ is a compact orientable 3-manifold with a single boundary component , which has an embedded graph ( spine ) which is a homotopy retract .",
    "a _ compression body _ is obtained by attaching 2-handles to the boundary surface @xmath4 of a product @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath0 is a closed orientable surface of genus at least two .",
    "we refer to @xmath6 as the _ outer boundary _ and the other boundary components as the _ inner boundary _ of the compression body .",
    "none of the inner boundary surfaces are 2-spheres .",
    "we denote the outer boundary by @xmath0 rather than @xmath6 .",
    "a _ heegaard splitting _ of a compact orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 is a closed orientable surface @xmath0 embedded in @xmath2 so that splitting @xmath2 along @xmath0 gives two regions which are handlebodies or compression bodies .",
    "the _ hempel distance _ of a heegaard splitting @xmath0 for @xmath2 is defined as follows .",
    "consider the collections of curves @xmath7 and @xmath8 which bound compressing disks for @xmath0 in the two regions , which are handlebodies or compression bodies on either side of @xmath0 .",
    "a path between these collections is a sequence of essential simple closed curves @xmath9 so that each pair @xmath10 are disjoint and @xmath11 .",
    "the hempel distance is then the smallest value of @xmath12 amongst all such sequences .",
    "a heegaard splitting @xmath0 for @xmath2 is _ strongly irreducible _ if every compressing disk on one side of @xmath0 meets every compressing disk on the other side of @xmath0 .",
    "we start with the concept of suitable boundary pattern which comes from @xcite . we extend this to the case of compression bodies .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is a handlebody or compression body .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is a surface equal to the outer boundary of @xmath13 , if @xmath13 is a compression body , or the whole boundary @xmath14 if @xmath13 is a handlebody .",
    "let @xmath0 be divided into two subsurfaces @xmath15 so that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , all the curves of @xmath18 are essential in @xmath0 and any compressing disk for @xmath13 must intersect each of @xmath15 in at least two essential arcs",
    ". then we say that the pair @xmath19 is a _ suitable boundary pattern _ for @xmath13 .",
    "the following lemma comes from @xcite .",
    "we give a proof here with the extension to compression bodies , as this is a crucial result for our algorithm .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is a handlebody or compression body .",
    "two subsurfaces @xmath19 form a suitable boundary pattern for @xmath13 , where @xmath20 or the outer boundary of @xmath13 , depending on whether @xmath13 is a handlebody or compression body , if and only if the following conditions hold .",
    "firstly @xmath21 , @xmath16 and every curve of @xmath18 is essential in @xmath0 . secondly there is a complete collection @xmath22 of compressing disks for @xmath13 with the property that every disk @xmath23 in @xmath22 intersects each of @xmath15 in at least two essential arcs and selecting any compressing disk @xmath24 disjoint from @xmath22 , a replacement of a disk in @xmath22 by @xmath24 can not give a new complete collection of compressing disks which have total numbers of arcs of intersection with @xmath15 less than that for @xmath22 .    let us suppose that @xmath19 is a suitable boundary pattern for @xmath13 , and show that it satisfies the two conditions described in the statement .",
    "then , the first condition is included in the definition of a suitable boundary pattern . to show the second condition",
    ", we take any complete collection of compressing disks for @xmath13 so that the total numbers of arcs of intersection with @xmath19 is minimal .",
    "this collection satisfies the second condition .    to show the other direction ,",
    "suppose that subsurfaces @xmath19 of @xmath0 satisfy the conditions in the lemma .",
    "let us prove this is a suitable boundary pattern .",
    "so suppose to the contrary , that some compressing disk @xmath25 meets each of @xmath15 in one essential arc or is disjoint from one of these subsurfaces .",
    "consider the intersection of @xmath25 with the family @xmath22 .",
    "as usual , we can eliminate all loops of intersection by cutting and pasting .",
    "assume next that @xmath26 is an outermost arc of intersection between @xmath25 and some disk @xmath27 in @xmath22 so that @xmath26 cuts off a bigon @xmath28 on @xmath25 with interior disjoint from @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the bigons obtained by splitting @xmath27 along @xmath26 .",
    "if either of the disks @xmath30 is inessential , then an isotopy of @xmath27 reduces the number of arcs of intersection with @xmath25 . we can assume therefore that neither of the disks @xmath30 is inessential , by isotoping the family @xmath22 until the number of arcs of intersection with @xmath25 is minimal .",
    "notice that there must be at least two outermost bigons on @xmath25 and hence one of these bigons must intersect @xmath18 in at most one point , since there are at most two such points on @xmath31 by assumption .",
    "hence we see that if both @xmath29 intersect @xmath18 in at least two points , then a replacement of @xmath27 by either @xmath30 reduces the number of arcs of intersection with the boundary pattern . by the definition of a complete family of disks ,",
    "at least one of these two replacements must be a new complete family of disks for @xmath13 , so this contradicts our hypotheses in the lemma .",
    "the conclusion is that at least one of @xmath29 crosses @xmath18 in at most one point .",
    "but now , one of the disks @xmath30 is a compressing disk for @xmath13 disjoint from the family @xmath22 and which intersects @xmath18 in at most two points .",
    "we can replace one of the disks of @xmath22 by this disk and reduce the number of intersections with the boundary pattern , which is again a contradiction .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "note the algorithmic nature of the lemma , giving a bounded process to check if a given boundary pattern is suitable or not . for we can start with any boundary pattern on a handlebody or compression body .",
    "pick a complete family of compression disks and isotope them to remove any inessential arcs of intersection with the boundary pattern .",
    "if any disks in the family intersect the boundary pattern in at most two arcs , then the boundary pattern is not suitable .",
    "otherwise , one has to check whether any replacement can be done which decreases the number of intersections with the boundary pattern .",
    "there is an algorithm to check if such a replacement exists , since we need only search for compressing disks disjoint from the family with fewer intersections than those in the family .",
    "a quick summary is as follows .",
    "if we split @xmath13 open along a complete family of compressing disks , then the boundary pattern becomes a system of arcs joining pairs of disjoint simple closed curves on a 2-sphere , where each compressing disk becomes a pair of circles .",
    "normal curve theory can be used to list all simple closed curves on this 2-sphere , which are disjoint from all the simple closed curves and meet the system of arcs in fewer points than at least one of the disks .",
    "if such a curve separates the two circles representing a compressing disk and has fewer intersections with the arc system than this disk , then a replacement is possible . otherwise no replacement can be achieved .",
    "the key idea is to use very short hierarchies as in @xcite to decompose a @xmath32-manifold in our class into compression bodies and handlebodies with suitable boundary patterns",
    ". we can then view the process of building all our @xmath32-manifolds as starting with suitable boundary patterns on a collection of handlebodies and compression bodies and then gluing subsurfaces in pairs .",
    "an interesting observation will be that _ any _ gluing of pairs of subsurfaces is allowable to produce a @xmath32-manifold in our class .",
    "in particular , a given collection of handlebodies and compression bodies with suitable boundary pattern , where the subsurfaces can be matched in pairs , produces an infinite number of @xmath32-manifolds in our class .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact orientable irreducible atoroidal @xmath32-manifold which is either closed or has incompressible tori boundary . in both cases , assume @xmath2 has a closed embedded separating incompressible surface which is not boundary parallel .",
    "choose a maximal collection @xmath33 of disjoint embedded separating incompressible surfaces for @xmath2 which are not boundary parallel and not parallel to each other .",
    "then there is a decomposition of @xmath2 into a collection of handlebodies and compression bodies with suitable boundary pattern .",
    "in fact , there is a collection of spanning surfaces @xmath34 with the following properties .",
    "firstly each region @xmath35 obtained by cutting @xmath2 open along @xmath33 has spanning surfaces which are incompressible and boundary incompressible surfaces with boundary on each of the surfaces in @xmath36 .",
    "these spanning surfaces have the property that they do not separate @xmath35 so that when @xmath35 is cut open along the spanning surfaces , the result is either a handlebody or a compression body , where the inner boundary surfaces are tori in @xmath3 .",
    "the boundary pattern arises by taking subsurfaces in @xmath37 which are copies of the spanning surfaces and subsurfaces in @xmath38 which are in @xmath33 .",
    "it suffices to construct the spanning surfaces inside a single region @xmath35 obtained by cutting @xmath2 open along @xmath33 .",
    "assume first that @xmath35 has all boundary surfaces which are copies of surfaces in @xmath33 .",
    "in this case , we follow the argument in @xcite .",
    "it suffices to find a homomorphism @xmath39 from @xmath40 onto @xmath41 so that every component @xmath42 of @xmath43 has the property that the image of the inclusion map @xmath44 has image which is not in the kernel of @xmath39 .",
    "once @xmath39 has been constructed , then we follow the argument of stallings @xcite .",
    "namely we can construct a map @xmath45 so that the induced homomorphism on first homology is @xmath39 . then surgering the pullback of a point @xmath46 in @xmath47",
    ", we can replace @xmath48 by a homotopic map , again denoted by @xmath48 , with the property that @xmath49 is collection of required spanning surfaces .    to build @xmath39 , note that as is well known , each component @xmath42 of @xmath43 has induced inclusion @xmath44 with image @xmath50 having rank at least the genus of @xmath42 .",
    "so one can build a homomorphism @xmath51 so that the image of @xmath50 is non zero . then , by taking an appropriate linear combination of these maps @xmath52 , we get the homomorphism @xmath39 required .",
    "the final step is straightforward , once we have built the spanning surfaces , cutting @xmath35 open along them must give a handlebody .",
    "for we get a connected @xmath32-manifold and compressing the boundary can not give any closed separating incompressible surfaces which are not boundary parallel in @xmath35 , for otherwise we would contradict the maximality of the collection of surfaces in @xmath33 .",
    "the conclusion is that the boundary is completely compressible and so the manifold must be a handlebody .",
    "finally notice that the boundary pattern induced as in the statement of the theorem , is indeed a suitable boundary pattern .",
    "for if we had any compressing disks meeting the boundary pattern in fewer then four arcs , then either a spanning surface would be boundary compressible , or a spanning surface or surface in @xmath33 would be compressible .",
    "since neither is the case , this completes the discussion of the first case , once @xmath39 is built .",
    "next , in the case that @xmath35 has some boundary components in @xmath3 , the only difference from the previous case is that we need a homomorphism @xmath53 with the properties that for each component @xmath42 of @xmath43 which is a copy of a surface in @xmath33 , the image @xmath50 of the mapping @xmath44 is not in the kernel of @xmath54 , whereas if @xmath42 is a boundary torus of @xmath3 , then @xmath50 is in kernel @xmath54 .",
    "the construction of @xmath54 follows a similar pattern to the previous argument .",
    "the main difference is that we can find a mapping @xmath55 for boundary surfaces in both @xmath43 and in @xmath33 , so that @xmath54 maps each image of the first homology of a boundary torus to zero .",
    "this follows by noting that the image @xmath50 of the mapping @xmath44 always contains elements not in the images of the first homology of the boundary tori .",
    "so it is straightforward to find such mappings @xmath55 and then take a linear combination to find @xmath54 .    as in the previous case ,",
    "when we cut @xmath35 open along all the spanning surfaces , we obtain a manifold with two types of boundary surfaces .",
    "one type comes from surfaces in @xmath33 cut open along spanning surfaces .",
    "the other type are boundary tori .",
    "compressing the first types of surface must result in a collection of products @xmath56 $ ] , one for each boundary torus , since any other possibility will contradict the maximality of the family @xmath33 .",
    "proving the boundary pattern is suitable is the same as above .",
    "note that the first type of boundary surfaces form the outer boundary and the boundary tori form the inner boundary of the compression body .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we are interested first in the case where @xmath0 is a closed orientable surface of genus @xmath57 and two 2-handles are attached to @xmath5 $ ] along separating essential curves @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "if we project both curves @xmath60 onto @xmath0 , abusing notation by using the same symbols for the projected curves , then @xmath61 , where @xmath12 is a positive integer . here",
    "we also assume that the projected curves cross transversely and minimally .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the curve complex for @xmath0 .",
    "we are interested in paths @xmath62 in @xmath7 , where the three curves @xmath63 are disjoint and non parallel and hence form a 2-simplex in the curve complex , with @xmath64 .",
    "we also want the three curves @xmath65 to be disjoint and non parallel .",
    "moreover we require that each @xmath66 is separating , both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are non separating and @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 are all decreasing , as @xmath72 increases .",
    "note that the simplest such a path of curves arises when each pair @xmath73 meets in exactly four points , for @xmath74 .",
    "we will focus on this case .",
    "finally we order the curves so that @xmath75 and @xmath67 are on the same side of @xmath66 for each @xmath76 .",
    "see figure [ fig ] for simple example .",
    "note that this simple heegaard diagram @xmath77 has the following form .",
    "we can view @xmath78 as a standard essential separating curve splitting @xmath0 into two once - punctured tori @xmath79 .",
    "moreover the intersections @xmath80 are then families of essential arcs .",
    "the slopes of these arcs are not important , just the number of each type .",
    "so we can label these arcs by three non - negative integers @xmath81 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "next , the collection of arcs of @xmath85 attached to @xmath78 can be viewed as a circle with a collection of arcs joining pairs of points and similarly for @xmath84 .",
    "a rotation @xmath35 of @xmath78 is required to determine how to match up these two families .",
    "we do this by rotating an end point of some chosen arc of @xmath82 so that it matches a similar end point of a chosen arc of @xmath84 .",
    "our convention is that the base points are chosen on @xmath78 corresponding to the first arcs in the families labelled @xmath86 and the rotation @xmath35 is done clockwise .",
    "we can then refer to the heegaard diagram @xmath87 .",
    "note that there are obvious necessary conditions for such a diagram to give a single separating curve , namely @xmath88 and the sum of @xmath89 s is even .    for the above procedure",
    ", the following questions arise naturally .",
    "* find sufficient conditions on @xmath90 to ensure that the resulting curve is separating and connected",
    ". it would be nice to even have an iterative scheme to build such diagrams .",
    "a possible approach is by band summing .",
    "namely taking two parallel arcs in @xmath91 and removing them , so long as there are parallel arcs in @xmath92 which have ends on either side of the first pair , then we can delete both pairs and if the first diagram gives a connected curve , so does the second .",
    "* find a suitable generalization to the case of arbitrary genus @xmath93 .",
    "possibly this might work better with a family of @xmath94 separating 2-handles attached to each of @xmath4 and to @xmath6 .",
    "so this would give a family of @xmath94 separating surfaces - see below .",
    "as in the previous section , let @xmath2 be a manifold obtained by adding a pair of 2-handles to @xmath5 $ ] along its two boundary components to curves @xmath77 .",
    "we put some additional conditions on the path @xmath62 in @xmath7 , which are sufficient to build a pair of separating incompressible surfaces in morse position relative to the height function on @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the manifold obtained by attaching two 2-handles to @xmath5 $ ] along separating essential curves @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath0 is a closed orientable surface of genus @xmath57 .",
    "consider a path @xmath62 in the curve complex @xmath7 for @xmath0 as in the previous section .",
    "suppose that @xmath66 intersects @xmath95 in four points , the two curves @xmath96 on the same side of @xmath66 must intersect at least twice , and the two curves @xmath97 on the other side of @xmath66 must also meet at least twice , for @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath2 contains two disjoint closed orientable separating incompressible surfaces @xmath98 .",
    "two disjoint surfaces @xmath98 in @xmath2 can be build from @xmath7 as follows .",
    "start with two parallel copies of the disk representing the 2-handle attached at @xmath99 at a level @xmath100 , where @xmath101 .",
    "next we glue on a pair of pants with one curve at @xmath102 and the other two curves along parallel copies of @xmath103 ( respectively @xmath104 ) at a level @xmath105 .",
    "next two pairs of pants are glued on with the first having two boundary curves to the copies of @xmath103 and the second using two copies of @xmath104 at a level @xmath105 and two copies of @xmath106 at a level @xmath107 .",
    "we continue on until eventually two pairs of pants are glued to two copies of @xmath108 and two copies of @xmath109 at a level @xmath110 and to two copies of the curve @xmath111 at at a level @xmath112 , where @xmath113 .",
    "note that @xmath114 .",
    "so this completes the construction of @xmath98 .    to show that @xmath98 are incompressible , by using standard inner - most arguments",
    ", it suffices to prove that there can not be a compressing disk in any of the three regions in the complement of @xmath115 . to summarize the argument , assume there is such a disk , say @xmath23 .",
    "note that each of the three regions has a collection of annuli with boundary on @xmath98 .",
    "the annuli have boundary curves given by the parallel copies of @xmath116 , which are essential on @xmath117 except for @xmath102 and @xmath118 , and so are incompressible except for the top and bottom ones .",
    "in fact , the region between @xmath117 and @xmath119 has annuli with boundaries on copies of @xmath120 , the region bounded by @xmath117 has annuli with boundaries on copies of @xmath121 and the final region bounded by @xmath119 has annuli with boundaries on @xmath122 .",
    "the annuli are not boundary compressible in the regions .",
    "suppose that there was such a boundary compression disk , which can be assumed to be a disk with one boundary arc on such an annulus , one on @xmath117 or @xmath119 and interior disjoint from all the annuli , @xmath117 and @xmath119 .",
    "now the disk must lie in a handlebody of genus 2 or a region which is of the form torus @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the reason is that these are the regions formed by cutting @xmath2 open along @xmath117 or @xmath119 and all the annuli .",
    "the latter type of region is a product , so we see that there are no such a boundary compression disk in such a region .",
    "the former is a region bounded by @xmath117 or @xmath124 having the annuli with boundaries on copies of @xmath121 or @xmath122 , respectively .",
    "this region can be regarded as a punctured torus @xmath123 $ ] , with copies of the annuli on the top and the bottom surfaces .",
    "our strategy here is to apply lemma 1 .",
    "namely if we have a complete collection of compressing disks for a genus 2 handlebody region , with the property that any disjoint compressing disk meets the boundary pattern at least as many times as the disks in the family , then the boundary pattern is disk busting . in our situation , the way to implement this is to think of two copies of each of the curves @xmath96 or @xmath97 as the boundary pattern and the disks of the form arc @xmath123 $ ] as the complete family .",
    "then the assumption that the curves @xmath96 intersect twice , implies that there can not be a disk which crosses an annulus with two boundary curves parallel to @xmath75 but does not meet @xmath67 and similarly for the case of @xmath97 .",
    "so this proves our assertion about the annuli .",
    "therefore any such a disk @xmath23 can be isotoped off these annuli and so must lie between levels of the form @xmath125 , for @xmath126 or in the region above the level @xmath100 or below the level @xmath127 .",
    "the latter are trivial regions which are 2-handles or products of the form torus @xmath123 $ ] .    to finish , we need to prove that there are no compressing disks inside these regions .",
    "now the former type are easily seen to be handlebodies of genus 2 or genus 3 with a natural product structure of the form once - punctured torus @xmath123 $ ] or four punctured sphere @xmath123 $ ] , depending on whether the region has boundary one surface or two surfaces . for the first type of region , the condition that @xmath75 and @xmath67 meet at least twice , implies that the any compressing disk , which is of the form arc @xmath123 $ ] , where the arc has both ends on @xmath66 , must meet these curves and so can not lie entirely on @xmath117 .",
    "it suffices to show then that there can not be a general compressing disk which misses both the curves @xmath96 or @xmath97 . to do this",
    ", we use lemma 1 again . in our situation , again , the way to implement this is to think of two copies of the curves @xmath96 or @xmath97 as the boundary pattern and the disks of the form arc @xmath123 $ ] as the complete family .    for the second type of region ,",
    "we repeat the argument using the boundary pattern consisting of two copies of each of @xmath128 .",
    "again the disks are of the form arc @xmath123 $ ] as the complete family , where the arcs have ends on the four punctured sphere , i.e the curves @xmath129 .",
    "each disk crosses the boundary pattern at least four times and the lemma above applies as previously .",
    "in fact , there is a complete system of quadrilateral disks of this form which meet each curve exactly once .",
    "so in fact , this region has a product structure by gluing these quad disks together and so @xmath98 are actually parallel .",
    "so this completes the proof that both @xmath117 and @xmath119 are incompressible .",
    "the same method could be used to consider families of surfaces in higher genus surface @xmath123 $ ] with 2 handles attached and also individual surfaces with more complex conditions implying the disk busting conditions .",
    "an interesting challenge is to see if such an approach is strong enough to show that a ` generic ' heegaard splitting gives a 3-manifold containing a separating incompressible surface .",
    "next , consider the result of dehn filling of each of the 4 boundary tori of the 3-manifold @xmath2 in the above theorem .",
    "clearly , the separating incompressible surface constructed has ` accidental parabolics ' on each of the four cusps",
    ". we can apply a well - known result of y. q. wu @xcite .",
    "there it is shown that any closed 3-manifold @xmath130 obtained by dehn filling @xmath2 along a curve in each cusp , which meets the ( unique ) accidental parabolic for the surface at least twice , then the separating surface remains incompressible in @xmath130 .",
    "so this gives a large number of examples of closed 3-manifolds @xmath130 of heegaard genus two possessing separating incompressible surfaces .",
    "moreover it is easy to see that most of the these examples are rational homology 3-spheres and hence have no non - separating incompressible surfaces .",
    "suppose we start with a separating closed orientable incompressible surface @xmath117 and a strongly irreducible heegaard splitting @xmath0 of a closed irreducible orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 or compact irreducible orientable 3-manifold @xmath2 with incompressible tori boundary .",
    "we would like to reverse the process of the previous sections and write levels of @xmath0 as spanning surfaces to complete a hierarchy of @xmath2 starting with @xmath117 .",
    "note that we do not require @xmath117 to be connected , so it could be a separating family of surfaces , with individual members which are non - separating .",
    "we use the notation @xmath131 , @xmath132 , as the singular foliation of @xmath2 by copies of @xmath0 . .",
    "we will denote the two handlebodies or compression bodies obtained by splitting @xmath2 open along @xmath131 by @xmath133 .",
    "as @xmath134 , @xmath135 or @xmath136 respectively will converge to a graph or a graph connected to some of the tori boundary components of @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath137 small enough , we can assume that @xmath117 meets @xmath135 in a family of meridian disks .",
    "next denote the two sides of @xmath117 by @xmath138 .",
