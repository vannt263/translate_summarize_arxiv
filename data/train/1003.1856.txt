    "the crowded environment with structural obstacles can be considered as a disordered lattice , where a given fraction of randomly chosen sites are to be avoided by the polymer chain .",
    "it has been proven both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite , that weak uncorrelated disorder that corresponds to the point - like randomly distributed obstacles with concentration far from the percolation threshold does not change the universality class of polymers . in the present study , we address a model , where the structural obstacles of the environment are spatially correlated on a mesoscopic scale @xcite .",
