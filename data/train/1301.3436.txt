    "fundamental to many - body quantum mechanics is the notion of identical particles and associated particle statistics .",
    "many of the remarkable quantum phenomena observed in nature are direct consequences of the fact that identical particles in three spatial dimensions are either _ bosons _ , obeying bose - einstein statistics , or _ fermions _ , obeying fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "for example , the amplification of light in lasers by superposition of photons is possible because they are bosons , while the periodic table of elements arises from the sequential filling of atomic shells by electrons which are fermions .",
    "this binary classification has been known since the early days of quantum theory , and follows logically from the requirement that an @xmath0-body wave function @xmath1 , modeled as a square - integrable complex - valued function on the @xmath0-particle configuration space @xmath2 , or alternatively as an element of the tensor product of one - particle spaces @xmath3 , has to be either symmetric ( corresponding to bosons ) or antisymmetric ( corresponding to fermions ) under the action of permutations of the particle labels  which , if the particles are indistinguishable , must leave the observable probability @xmath4 invariant .",
    "however , it was discovered in the 1970 - 80 s @xcite that this simple picture for identical particles and statistics is logically incomplete and should be replaced by a more general framework , which in three ( or higher ) space dimensions nicely reduces to the above binary picture , but in the one and two dimensional cases actually admits a wider range of possibilities .",
    "identical particles classified via this generalized framework , but falling outside the usual boson / fermion classification , were said to obey _ intermediate _ or _ fractional statistics_.",
    "although _ elementary _ identical particles live in three space dimensions and hence must be either bosons or fermions , these more exotic one- and two - dimensional possibilities have recently become more than just a mathematical curiosity , with the advent of trapped bosonic condensates @xcite and quantum hall physics @xcite , and thereby the discoveries of effective models of particles ( or _ quasi_-particles ) which seem to obey these generalized rules for identical particles and statistics ( see @xcite for reviews ) .    in two space dimensions the usual requirement , that the phase change of the wave function which arises from an interchange of two identical particles ( or , in the more precise general framework , from a _ continuous _ simple interchange of two particles ) needs to be either + 1 ( boson ) or -1 ( fermion ) , is no longer valid .",
    "this interchange phase is instead allowed to be _ any _ fixed unit complex number @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding particles are called _ anyons _ , and are alternatively parameterized by the real - valued statistics parameter @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "a standard way to model such anyons is by means of bosons in @xmath7 together with magnetic potentials @xmath8 of aharonov - bohm - type with strength @xmath9 between every pair of particles ( see below ) , giving rise to the correct phase of the wave function as the particles interchange or encircle each other @xcite .",
    "the free kinetic energy operator for @xmath0 anyons is thus given by ( see ; we use the unit conventions @xmath10 ) @xmath11 and acting on completely symmetric wave functions @xmath12 .",
    "in one dimension , the above geometric picture of continuous interchanges of particles breaks down  particles have to collide in order to be interchanged . in a quantum mechanical context",
    "this necessitates the prescription of boundary conditions for the wave function at the collision points @xmath13 ( i.e. at the boundary of the proper configuration space @xmath14 , in this case with codimension one ) .",
    "there are two ways in which one may arrive naturally at a set of boundary conditions .",
    "one approach @xcite , which is generally referred to as _ schrdinger - type quantization _ , starts out with the proper configuration space @xmath15 and imposes a general ( robin ) boundary condition of the form @xmath16 at @xmath17 , with @xmath18 an arbitrary but fixed statistics parameter .",
    "the case @xmath19 corresponds to bosons ( neumann b.c . ) and @xmath20 to fermions ( dirichlet b.c . ) .",
    "such boundary conditions can , if @xmath21 is extended from @xmath15 to @xmath22 and modeled symmetric about @xmath23 , alternatively be encoded by a delta potential @xmath24 , and the resulting model for 1d intermediate statistics , represented with a modified kinetic energy operator @xmath25 and acting on completely symmetric wave functions @xmath26 , is equivalent to the lieb - liniger model @xcite for a gas of bosons on @xmath27 with delta interactions .",
    "another , inequivalent but just as well - motivated , approach to 1d intermediate statistics is to consider _ heisenberg - type quantization _",
    "@xcite in the sense that one starts out with the classical phase space @xmath28 and its observables ( both should be symmetrized w.r.t",
    ". relabeling of particles ) and considers representations of a corresponding algebra of operators .",
    "one finds , in the two - particle case , that the relevant representations are labeled by a continuous parameter @xmath29 , and that in the standard coordinate representation this amounts to imposing a boundary condition @xmath30 for the wave function as the relative coordinate @xmath31 ( this relation with boundary conditions is more complicated and will be elaborated in section [ sec : identical_1d ] below , but the restriction @xmath32 is always required for square - integrability ) . in this",
    "context bosons correspond to @xmath33 and fermions to @xmath34 .",
    "again , using symmetric @xmath21 the general boundary condition or choice of representation can equivalently be encoded by an interaction potential , of the form @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting model can be extended to the @xmath0-particle case and is equivalent to the homogeneous part of the calogero - sutherland model @xcite , represented with a modified kinetic energy operator @xmath36 and again acting on completely symmetric wave functions @xmath26 .",
    "one may ask what properties these different types of identical particles possess .",
    "the fundamental characteristic property of fermions is that they obey _ pauli s exclusion principle _ ,",
    "i.e. the fact that the antisymmetry of the wave function implies that no two particles can occupy the same single - particle state : @xmath37 for any @xmath38",
    ". a powerful consequence of this is the _ lieb - thirring inequality _",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the energy of @xmath0 ( spinless ) fermions in an external potential @xmath39 in @xmath40 , given by ( again , with the conventions @xmath10 , and @xmath41 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 a positive constant . here",
    "@xmath45 denote the negative eigenvalues ( ordered by decreasing magnitude and with multiplicity ) of the one - particle operator @xmath46 .",
    "the first inequality expresses the pauli exclusion principle while the second concerns the trace over the negative spectrum of @xmath47 and in some sense incorporates the uncertainty principle .",
    "in fact , the lieb - thirring inequality is equivalent to the _ kinetic energy inequality _",
    "@xmath48 with @xmath49 another positive constant is a factor @xmath50 smaller than its semiclassical value with @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "it is conjectured that for @xmath52 the inequality for fermions holds with exactly the semiclassical constant and the thomas - fermi expression on the r.h.s . @xcite .",
    "] , and @xmath53 the one - particle density function associated to @xmath21 : @xmath54 the inequality can be interpreted as a strong form of the uncertainty principle valid for fermions .",
    "these inequalities need to be weakened in the case of weaker exclusion .",
    "e.g. , in the situation that up to @xmath55 particles can occupy the same one - particle state ( sometimes referred to as _ gentile intermediate statistics _",
    "@xcite ) , the r.h.s . of resp . are to be multiplied by @xmath56 resp .",
    "@xmath57 . for bosons",
    "there is no restriction on the number of particles in the same state ; we can e.g. consider @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the ground state of @xmath47 .",
    "hence bosons can be accommodated by taking @xmath60 , and the inequalities become trivial as @xmath61 . however ,",
    "for intermediate and fractional statistics ( in the above sense ) the picture is more complicated .",
    "there have been partially successful attempts to relate also such many - body quantum states to one - particle states restricted by some exclusion principle @xcite , but so far no general picture has emerged .",
    "the difficulty has to do with the fact that these generalized exchange statistics are naturally modeled using _ interacting _ hamiltonians , hence leaving the much simpler realm of single - particle operators and spaces .",
    "in @xcite we found that anyons in @xmath7 , with statistics parameter @xmath62 an _ odd numerator fraction _",
    ", satisfy a kinetic energy inequality of the form @xmath63 implying the lieb - thirring inequality @xmath64 for some positive constants @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( numerical estimates will be given below ) . for a general statistics",
    "parameter @xmath29 and finite @xmath0 these inequalities hold with @xmath67 replaced by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 however , this expression tends to zero as @xmath61 , except when @xmath62 is an odd numerator ( reduced ) fraction in which case @xmath70 ( cp .",
    "figure 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "this , at first unexpected , difference between odd numerator fractions and even numerator and irrational @xmath9 is further discussed in @xcite , where we also provide some arguments for this difference actually being natural .",
    "in contrast to previous proofs of the standard lieb - thirring inequalities and , the inequality for anyons was proved using a _",
    "local _ form of the uncertainty principle together with a _",
    "local _ form of the exclusion principle , valid for anyons with general @xmath9 and involving the constant @xmath71 in measuring the strength of exclusion .",
    "our inspiration for this local approach to lieb - thirring inequalities , applicable to interacting systems , was the original proof of stability of ordinary fermionic matter @xcite due to dyson and lenard ( see also @xcite ) which involved only local , comparatively weak , consequences of the pauli principle for fermions ( see lemma [ lem : local_exclusion_f ] below ) .",
    "in this work we consider further consequences of our results in @xcite for anyons , and extend the above families of lieb - thirring - type inequalities to identical particles obeying intermediate exchange statistics in one dimension , in the above sense .",
