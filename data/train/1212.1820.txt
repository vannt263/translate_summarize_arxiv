    "in 1961 zaitsev  @xcite supposed that all solvable lie algebras of a fixed dimension could be obtained via contractions from the semisimple algebras of the same dimension .",
    "he called such solvable lie algebras ` limiting solvable ' and proposed the contraction procedure for the ` limiting classification ' of solvable lie algebras .",
    "later the same conjecture was also formulated by other scientists , e.g. celeghini and tarlini  .",
    "complexity of the actual state of affairs was illustrated in  @xcite , where contractions of real and complex low - dimensional lie algebras were studied .",
    "the incorrectness of the above conjecture was illustrated by the fact that all semisimple ( and reductive ) lie algebras are unimodular and any continuous contraction of a unimodular algebra necessarily results in a unimodular algebra .",
    "moreover , semisimple lie algebras exist not in all dimensions .    the aim of this paper is to revisit zaitsev s conjecture in terms of @xmath0-expansions .",
    "we will study @xmath0-expansions of the real three - dimensional lie algebras .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that generalized inn ",
    "wigner contractions give a particular case of @xmath0-expansions .",
    "this is why we consider only pairs of such algebras that are not connected by a contraction .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 contains preliminary information on @xmath0-expansions and relevant objects . in section 3",
    "we construct several key examples of three - dimensional @xmath0-expansions and discuss the possibility of application of @xmath0-expansions to the classification of solvable lie algebras .",
    "roughly speaking , the _ @xmath0-expansion _ is the `` product '' of the semigroup and the lie algebra with a lie algebra structure defined in a special way .",
    "the notion was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it generalizes the notions of expansion , deformation ( under a proper choice of the corresponding semigroup ) , extension and generalized inn ",
    "wigner contraction .",

    "here and in what follows the indices @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 run from  1 to  @xmath2 and the indices @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 run from  1 to  @xmath14 .",

    "therefore , an appropriate representative from the isomorphism class of the initial lie algebra @xmath3 should be chosen if @xmath0-expansion is used for a certain purpose .",
    "in other words , sometimes the structure constants tensor has to be transformed by an element of the group @xmath23 before the expansion procedure .",
    "of course , commutation relations of the expanded algebra @xmath21 can also be reduced to an appropriate form using a change of basis .",

    "therefore for some purposes it is reasonable to consider certain subalgebras or reduced algebras of less dimensions instead of working with the whole expanded algebra .",
    "the problem of the construction of algebras of less dimension that are related to an expanded lie algebra is rather complicated .",
    "two classes of such algebras were presented in  @xcite for @xmath0-expanded lie algebras admitting an agreed decomposition of the associated semigroups and lie algebras .",
