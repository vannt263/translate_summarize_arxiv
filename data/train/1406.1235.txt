    "disorder which is inevitably present in most materials can dramatically affect their properties .  @xcite it can lead to changes in their electronic structure and transport .",
    "one of the most interesting effects of disorder is the spatial confinement of charge carriers due to coherent backscattering off random impurities which is known as anderson localization .",
    "@xcite despite progress over the last decades , the subject of anderson localization remains an active area of research .",
    "the lack of quantitative analytical results has meant that numerical investigations ( see for e.g. , refs .  )",
    "have provided a significant role in understanding the anderson transition .",
    "@xcite    the simplest model used to study the effects of disorder in materials is a single band tight binding model with a random on - site disorder potential .",
    "@xcite such a model is justified when the disorder is introduced by substitutional impurities , as in a binary alloy .",
    "the substitution of host atoms by impurities only leads to changes of the local potential on the substitutional site and , on average , does not affect the neighbors .",
    "@xcite in this situation , the disorder appears only in the diagonal terms of the hamiltonian and hence is referred to as diagonal disorder .",
    "however , when the bandwidth of the dopant is very different from the one of the pure host , such substitution results not only in the change of the local potential but may also affect the neighboring sites .",
    "@xcite consequently , a simple model to capture such effects should include both random local potentials and random hopping amplitudes which depend on the occupancy of the sites .",
    "the dependence of the hopping amplitude on the disorder configuration is usually referred to as off - diagonal disorder .",
    "of course , a proper theoretical description of realistic disordered materials requires the inclusion of both diagonal and off - diagonal randomness .",
    "the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) is a widely used single site mean field theory for systems with strictly diagonal disorder .",
    "@xcite blackman , esterling and berk ( beb )  @xcite have extended the cpa to systems with off - diagonal disorder . however , being single - site approximations , the cpa and the beb theories neglect all disorder induced non - local correlations .",
    "there have been a number of attempts to develop systematic nonlocal extensions to the cpa .",
    "these include cluster extensions such as the molecular coherent potential approximation ( mcpa ) ,  @xcite the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) ,  @xcite etc .",
    "self - consistent mean field studies of off - diagonal disorder have been conducted by a number of authors .",
    "@xcite however , all these studies have been performed at the local single - site beb level . to include the effects of off - diagonal disorder ,",
    "gonis @xcite extended the molecular cpa , which uses a self - consistently embedded finite size cluster to capture non - local corrections to the cpa .",
    "however , he criticized the mcpa for violating translational invariance and other critical properties of a valid quantum cluster theory .",
    "@xcite in order to take into account such non - local effects on off - diagonal disorder models while maintaining translational invariance , we extend the beb formalism using the dca scheme .",
    "@xcite    while the cpa , dca , and beb have shown to be successful self - consistent mean - field theories for the quantitative description of the density of states and electronic structure of disordered systems , they can not properly address the physics of anderson localization .",
    "these mean field approaches describe the effective medium using the average density of states which is not critical at the transition .",
    "@xcite thus , theories which rely on such averaged quantities will fail to properly characterize anderson localization . as noted by anderson ,",
    "the probability distribution of the local density of states must be considered , focusing on the most probable or the _ typical _ value .  @xcite close to the anderson transition , the distribution is found to have very long tails characteristic of a log - normal distribution.@xcite in fact , the distribution is log - normal up to ten orders of magnitude  @xcite and so the typical value  @xcite is the geometrical mean .",
    "based on this idea , dobrosavljevi  @xcite formulated a single site typical medium theory ( tmt ) for the anderson localization .",
    "this approximation gives a qualitative description of the anderson localization in three dimensions .",
    "however , it fails to properly describe the trajectory of the mobility edge ( which separates the extended and localized states ) as it neglects non - local corrections and so does not include the effects of coherent backscattering .",
    "@xcite it also underestimates considerably the critical strength of the disorder at which the localization happens .",
    "in addition , tmt is only formulated for diagonal disorder .",
    "recently , by employing the dca within the typical medium analysis , we developed a systematic typical medium dynamical cluster approximation ( tmdca ) formalism .",
    "@xcite the tmdca provides an accurate description of the anderson localization transition for modest cluster sizes in three - dimensional models with diagonal disorder while recovering the tmt for a one - site cluster . in this work",
    ", we generalize our recently proposed tmdca scheme to address the question of electron localization in systems with both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder .    to go beyond the local single - site cpa - like level of the beb formalism",
    ", we employ the dca  @xcite scheme which systematically incorporates non - local spatial correlations effects .",
    "hence , in this paper , we first present an extension of the dca for systems with both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder .",
    "next , we develop a typical medium dynamical cluster approximation formalism capable of incorporating the effects of anderson localization both for diagonal and off - diagonal disorder . we then perform a systematic study of the effects of non - local correlations and off - diagonal randomness on the density of states and electron localization .",
    "the results of our calculations are compared with the ones obtained with other numerical methods for finite size lattices , including exact diagonalization , kernel polynomial , and transfer matrix methods .",
