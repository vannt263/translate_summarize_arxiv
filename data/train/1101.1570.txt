    "optical bistability is a manifestation of nonlinearity in optical systems which is well known in the laser physics community @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it describes a situation in which there are two possible stable output light intensities for a single input intensity , and occurs when an optical medium with a nonlinear refractive index is placed inside an optical cavity formed from two mirrors .",
    "the bistable behaviour results from the combination of the nonlinearity of the medium with the action of the feedback provided by the mirrors .    a new addition to the family of systems displaying optical bistability has recently been demonstrated in experiments performed by the ultracold atom groups at berkeley @xcite and the eth @xcite who found optical bistability in systems comprising of vapors of ultracold atoms trapped inside optical cavities which are driven by laser light .",
    "the atomic vapor acts as a dielectric medium and , despite being tenuous , can significantly perturb the light in a cavity with a small mode volume and high finesse if the cooperativity @xmath0 is in the regime @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number of atoms , @xmath3 is the single photon rabi frequency , @xmath4 is the atomic spontaneous emission rate in free space , and @xmath5 is the cavity energy damping rate .",
    "the perturbation of the light by the atoms is nonlinear and distorts the cavity lineshape away from being a lorentzian which is symmetric about the resonance frequency into one with an asymmetric shape . for large enough",
    "cooperativity the lineshape becomes folded over ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nonlorent ] below ) , so that for a certain range of frequencies there are three possible output light intensities ( two stable , one unstable ) from the cavity for a single input intensity . the experiments @xcite and",
    "@xcite exhibited this optical bistability as a hysteresis effect seen by chirping the laser frequency through the cavity resonance from above and below the resonance : a sudden jump in the intensity of light transmitted through the cavity was observed which occurred at two different frequencies , depending upon the direction of the chirp .",
    "an important difference between traditional laser systems and the ultracold atom experiments @xcite is the origin of the nonlinearity . in the former case the nonlinearity of the medium occurs in its polarization response ,",
    "i.e. it arises from the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms .",
    "by contrast , in the ultracold atom experiments the detuning of the cavity from atomic resonance was large enough that the polarization response was in the linear regime .",
    "the nonlinearity was instead due to the response of the centre - of - mass wave function of the atoms : the atoms re - arrange their position distribution according to the balance between the dipole force applied by the intracavity light field ( which forms a periodic lattice ) and their zero - point energy . as a consequence , the depth of the optical lattice that forms inside the cavity in experiments like @xcite and @xcite",
    "is not fixed purely by the drive laser intensity , as is the case in standard optical lattices made by interfering laser beams in free space .",
    "rather , when @xmath6 the depth of the lattice is sensitive to the spatial distribution of the atoms trapped in the cavity , and , in turn , the atoms center - of - mass wave function is sensitive to the lattice depth .",
    "this feedback nonlinearity , which leads to different amounts of transmitted / reflected light for a given input intensity depending on the spatial distribution of the atoms , has been previously employed to detect the presence of a single atom in a cavity @xcite , as well as to monitor the motion of atoms trapped in cavities @xcite .",
    "more recently , there has also been considerable theoretical interest in the effect of the feedback nonlinearity upon the many - body quantum state of ultracold atoms in cavities @xcite .",
    "we note , in particular , the theoretical work on self - organisation and related phenomena @xcite , culminating in the experimental observation of the dicke quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "striking nonlinear phenomena also occur when ultracold atoms are trapped in standard `` fixed '' free - space lattices @xcite .",
    "of special interest to us here are the curious swallowtail loops that occur in the band structure ( energy versus quasi - momentum ) of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in one - dimensional optical lattices .",
    "these loops have been studied theoretically by a number of groups @xcite in order to explain the breakdown in superfluidity observed in experiments where a bec flows through a lattice @xcite .",
    "the loops correspond to multiple solutions for the atomic wave function within a single band for a certain range of quasi - momenta .",
    "they can occur either around the boundaries of the brillouin zone or the center , depending upon the band and the sign of the interactions .",
    "they manifest themselves physically via a dynamical instability that destroys the superflow .",
    "however , the nonlinearity responsible for the swallowtail loops in the free - space lattices is provided by the interatomic interactions , which become important at the densities required for bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the loops occur when the strength of the interactions is above a critical value @xcite , and therefore non - interacting atoms in an optical lattice do not display these instabilities .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to investigate whether the cavity feedback nonlinearity associated with optical bistability in ultracold atoms can also lead to loops in the atomic band structure .",
    "as we shall see , the answer to this question is in general affirmative , and so band structure loops appear to be a robust phenomenon which appear whatever the source nonlinearity , although the structure and location of the loops does depend on the details of the nonlinearity .",
    "one consequence of loops in the atomic band structure is a hysteresis effect @xcite if the quasi - momentum is swept through the band , and a consequent loss of adiabaticity even if the quasi - momentum is swept infinitely slowly @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on a two - site lattice have confirmed this scenario @xcite .",
    "these effects have implications for experiments that use bloch oscillations of cold atoms in optical lattices for high precision measurements , for example to determine the fine structure constant @xmath7 @xcite , to measure gravity @xcite , or to investigate casimir - polder forces @xcite .",
    "the band structure hysteresis is reminiscent of the hysteresis described above in the context of the optical bistability experiments @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , as we shall show in this paper , for atoms in an optical cavity the two effects are different sides of the same coin , one being seen in the light and the other in the atoms .",
    "of particular relevance , therefore , are two recent proposals @xcite concerning bloch oscillations of atoms inside optical cavities that rely upon the modification of the transmitted / reflected light arising from the feedback nonlinearity as a non - destructive measurement of the bloch oscillations .",
    "the presence of loops will severely disrupt the bloch oscillations . in the case where the nonlinearity has its origin in atom - atom interactions",
    "the loops can be eliminated by , e.g. , using spin polarized fermions @xcite or by reducing the interactions via a feshbach resonance @xcite . however , when the nonlinearity is due to the feedback nonlinearity these methods do not apply , and one of our aims here is see if there are regimes where the feedback nonlinearity is present and leads to a modification of the light , but remains below a critical value needed to form loops in the atomic band structure . in order to allow the origin of the nonlinearity to be clearly identified",
    ", we shall only consider non - interacting atoms in this paper , but our calculations can be easily extended to include interactions .",
    "the plan for the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we give a brief description of the system and introduce the mean - field hamiltonian describing cold atoms dispersively interacting with the single mode of a cavity . in section [ sec3 ] we derive a reduced hamiltonian describing the nonlinear evolution for the atomic field after the adiabatic elimination of the light field . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we calculate the band structure by two different methods that solve for the spatially extended eigenstates ( bloch states ) of the reduced hamiltonian , and show that the two methods give the same results .",
    "we find that for certain parameter regimes , the energy as a function of quasi - momentum develops loop structures . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we recall the optical bistability in atom - cavity systems discussed by @xcite and make the connection between the loop dispersions and bistability . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we develop an analytical estimate for the critical pump strength necessary to generate loops and in section [ sec7 ] we test this result by illustrating how the band structure depends on laser detuning and laser intensity , i.e.  the birth and death of loops as these parameters are varied . in section [ sec8 ] , we show that for quasi - momentum @xmath8 the system can exhibit tristability ( five solutions for the steady state cavity photon number ) .    a convenient mathematical framework for describing bifurcations of a system whereby there is a sudden change in the number of solutions as a parameter is smoothly changed is catastrophe theory @xcite . catastrophe theory was applied to the problem of optical bistability in the late 1970s by a number of authors including gilmore and narducci @xcite and agarwal and carmichael @xcite . in section [ sec9 ] we relate the problem of atom - cavity multistability to catastrophe theory and show that the system under consideration can be described by swallowtail catastrophes organized by an ( unobserved ) butterfly catastrophe and use this to understand multistability .",
    "this is followed in section [ sec10 ] by a discussion of the stability of these solutions and finally we conclude in section [ sec11 ] .",
    "there is also an appendix which summarizes some concepts of catastrophe theory .",
    "consider a gas of @xmath2 ultracold atoms inside a fabry - perot optical cavity .",
    "the atoms interact quasi - resonantly with a single cavity mode of the electromagnetic field of frequency @xmath9 , and it varies along the cavity axis as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "this cavity mode is externally pumped by a laser of frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the relevant frequency relations can be characterized with the two detunings @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the atomic transition frequency . in the dispersive regime ,",
    "the occupation of the excited atomic state is vanishingly small and it can be adiabatically eliminated . a one - dimensional hamiltonian for the atom - cavity system in the dispersive regime can then be written as @xcite @xmath15 { \\ensuremath{\\hat{\\psi } } } , \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the field operators for the atoms and the cavity photons , respectively .",
    "we have written the hamiltonian in a frame rotating with the pump laser frequency @xmath18 , which leads to the appearance of the two detunings .",
    "the first term is just the free field evolution of the cavity mode .",
    "the second term represents the laser coherently pumping the cavity at rate @xmath19 , and the third term describes the atomic part of the hamiltonian .",
    "it consists of a kinetic energy part and a potential energy part .",
    "the potential energy term can either be understood as the atom moving in a periodic potential with amplitude @xmath20 , or , if combined with the first term in the hamiltonian , as a shift in the resonance frequency of the cavity due to the coupling between the atom and the field ( see also eq .",
    "( [ eq : lighteqn ] ) below ) .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion for the atom and photon field operators can be obtained from the above hamiltonian . in this paper",
    "we are interested in properties at a mean - field level , where operators are replaced by their expectation values and correlations between products of operators are neglected . in other words , the light is assumed to be in a coherent state with amplitude @xmath21 , and the atoms are assumed to all share the same single - particle wave function @xmath22 . from the heisenberg equations these amplitudes obey the following coupled equations of motion @xcite @xmath23 where we have scaled energies by the recoil energy @xmath24 , and time by @xmath25 .",
    "the depth of the periodic potential seen by the atoms is then given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mean number of photons in the cavity , and @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 the damping rate @xmath30 ( in units of @xmath31 ) of the amplitude of the light field in the cavity has been added into the equation of motion in order to account for a markovian coupling between the cavity mode and a zero temperature bath .",
    "we have also introduced the dimensionless length @xmath32 . in the above equations ,",
    "any fluctuations induced by the reservoirs have been neglected .",
    "this is justified when considering relatively large quantum numbers , for corrections see reference @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the band structure and this requires the quasi - momentum to be a good quantum number . physically",
    ", this implies that we are studying delocalized atomic wave functions which cover many lattice sites ( this is closer to the situation realized in the experiment @xcite than that realized in @xcite where the atoms were localized to just a few sites ) .",
    "we shall therefore expand the wave function @xmath33 in bloch waves , as will be detailed in subsequent sections .",
    "it thus makes sense to normalize @xmath33 over one period of the potential as @xmath34 , and also evaluate the integrals appearing in the above equations over one period .",
    "in particular , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lighteqn ] ) which determines the coupling between the atoms and the light will be defined by @xmath35",
    "in this section we shall eliminate the optical degrees of freedom from the hamiltonian in order to obtain a description only in terms of the atoms .",
    "this results in a nonlinear schrdinger equation and an energy functional we shall refer to as the reduced hamiltonian .    setting @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lighteqn ] ) gives the steady state light amplitude in the cavity , @xmath37 which leads to the following equation for the steady state photon number @xmath38 in fact , this expression also holds to high accuracy in many time - dependent situations because @xmath30 is typically far greater than any frequency associated with the evolution of the external degrees of freedom of ultracold atoms . the light field",
    "is then slaved to the atoms and `` instantaneously '' adjusts itself to any change in @xmath33 .",

    "\\label{eq : energyfunctional}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as can be verified by applying hamilton s equation ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) .",
    "we shall refer to this functional as the reduced hamiltonian .",
    "the first term represents the kinetic energy .",
    "the second term is an atom - light coupling dependent term that can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the phase shift of the steady state light field inside the cavity relative to the pump laser is , from eq .",

    "note that this hamiltonian looks similar in form to the effective quantum two - mode hamiltonians obtained in the optomechanical limit in @xcite and @xcite , and also the ones describing bistability in @xcite .",
    "from now on we specialize to bloch wave solutions .",
    "we begin by describing two methods for calculating the bloch waves and their energies .",
    "agreement between the two methods will be demonstrated .",
    "the first method , which adapts that detailed in @xcite for a static optical lattice , hinges on the observation that the potential in the schrdinger eq .  ( [ eq : nonlineareqn ] ) is periodic with period @xmath52 ( in dimensionless units ) . despite the nonlinearity",
    ", the bloch theorem @xcite applies so that the eigenfunctions can be written as the product of a plane wave with wavenumber @xmath53 , called the quasi - momentum , and an amplitude @xmath54 which is periodic with the period of the lattice @xmath55 for the linear problem , the energies @xmath56 are arranged into bands separated by gaps . in the so - called reduced zone scheme for the band structure , @xmath53 lies in the first brillouin zone @xmath57 , and the band energies are folded back into the first brillouin zone .",
    "the periodicity of @xmath54 implies that it can be expanded as a fourier series .",
    "the bloch wave can therefore be written @xmath58 the notation for the @xmath59 expansion coefficient @xmath60 reflects the fact that it depends on the chosen value of @xmath53 .",
    "this expansion can now be substituted into the reduced hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : energyfunctional ] ) , and the resulting function numerically extremized with respect to the parameters @xmath60 , maintaining the normalization of @xmath61 throughout the procedure",
    ". we take the parameters @xmath60 to be real for the same reasoning as given in @xcite .",
    "the fourier series is terminated at some @xmath62 , which is determined by the convergence of the energy eigenvalues as @xmath63 is varied .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pethickmethod1 ] we plot the low lying part of energy spectrum @xmath64 $ ] as a function of quasi - momentum resulting from the extremization .",
    "the values of @xmath30 and @xmath2 are very close to the values used in the experiment with rubidium atoms described in @xcite , and the other parameters are chosen so as to exhibit the interesting behavior to be discussed in the rest of the paper .",
    "the two panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pethickmethod1 ] differ only in the value of the pump - cavity detuning @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : pethickmethod1]a shows a result familiar from linear problems involving quantum particles in periodic potentials , but fig .  [ fig : pethickmethod1]b shows a very different story : there are two other branches that together form a looped structure that is a manifestation of the nonlinearity of the reduced hamiltonian . as will be discussed more below , the loop shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pethickmethod1]b belongs to the first band ( in particular , it does not correspond to the second band because it only extends over part of the first brillouin zone ) .",
    "looped structures have been found before for becs in static optical lattices @xcite .",
    "we will come back to the similarities and differences between our results and @xcite in the next section .",
    "it is important to appreciate that , by virtue of the nonlinearity of the problem , the lattice depth @xmath66 is different at each value of the quasi - momentum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pethickmethod1 ] .",
    "furthermore , the lattice depth is different for each of the curves even at the same values of @xmath53 ( except at degeneracies ) . in this sense ,",
    "the band structure plots we display in this paper are non - standard because for static lattices the depth of the lattice is fixed for all values of @xmath53 . in order to obtain the lattice depth at each point on a curve @xmath67 $ ] in fig .  [",
    "fig : pethickmethod1 ] , one should take the wave function that extremizes the energy functional ( [ eq : energyfunctional ] ) at that point and enter it into the integral @xmath68 appearing on the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) for the photon number .",
    "this change in lattice depth with detuning is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlorent ] , but for the reader s convenience we have included some values at particular points @xmath53 in the caption of fig .  [",
    "fig : pethickmethod1 ] .    the fact that , depending on the detuning @xmath69 , there are either one or more steady state photon numbers for the cavity reminds us of the optical bistability observed in @xcite .",
    "there , as the cavity driving laser detuning was swept through the resonance , bistability was observed for certain pump strengths @xmath19 .",
    "the bistability derives from quantum effects @xcite in the sense that it is due to changes in the atomic center - of - mass wave function .",
    "it is distinct from standard semi - classical optical bistability  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the loops in the atomic band structure and optical bistability will be examined in detail in section [ sec5 ] . to complete this section we look at an alternative method for determining the eigenfunctions of the effective hamiltonian which makes the connection with bistability more transparent .      in the second method , the strategy is to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) directly for the steady - state photon number .",
    "this equation contains @xmath70 both explicitly on the left hand side and implicitly on the right hand side through the atomic wave function @xmath71 appearing in the integrand of the integral @xmath72 the photon number is not a parameter set from the outside ( e.g.  by the pump laser ) but must be solved for self - consistently . in our notation for the wave function we have therefore included @xmath70 in the list of arguments rather than the list of parameters .",
    "the dependence of @xmath71 upon the number of photons is because the depth of the lattice in which the atoms sit is given by @xmath73 , as can be seen directly from the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : atomeqn ] ) .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) must be solved self - consistently for @xmath70 , and we will often refer to it as the `` self - consistency equation '' . as mentioned in the introduction , the physical mechanism that gives rise to the feedback between the atoms and the light stems for the atom - light coupling , eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) [ or eq .",
    "( [ eq : redefintionofcoupling ] ) ] . the atoms spatial distribution controls the phase shift suffered by the light on traversing the cavity , and hence the cavity resonance condition , and therefore the amplitude of the light in the cavity . at the same time , the amplitude of the light determines the depth of the lattice which influences the atomic wave function .",
    "one class of solutions to the self - consistency problem is provided by the mathieu functions @xcite .",
    "in fact , these provide _ exact _ solutions because the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : atomeqn ] ) for a particle in a sinusoidal potential is nothing but the mathieu equation . despite the fact that the amplitude of the sinusoidal potential in ( [ eq : atomeqn ] ) itself depends on the solution @xmath71 of the equation , this amplitude evaluates to a constant because @xmath71 appears under the integral given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) .",
    "all that is necessary is that the wave function that enters into the integral is the same as the wave function appearing in the rest of the schrdinger equation .",
    "this is the case precisely when the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this leads us to a very important point : by virtue of the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) , the photon number @xmath70 is _ completely equivalent _ , in the sense of the information it carries , to the wave function @xmath43 .",
    "said another way , the mathieu functions are specified by only two quantities : the value of the quasi - momentum and the depth of the potential .",
    "thus , once we set the quasi - momentum , which is a parameter , the wave function is entirely determined by @xmath74 , where @xmath28 is also a parameter .",
    "we shall frequently take advantage of the equivalence between @xmath43 and @xmath70 in the rest of this paper because it allows us to replace the wave function by a single number @xmath70 .",
    "we shall denote the mathieu functions by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the band index .",
    "they satisfy mathieu s equation which in our problem takes the form @xmath77 our notation for the mathieu functions indicates the full parametric dependence with the exception of the atom - light coupling strength @xmath28 .",
    "note that in the mathieu functions we list @xmath70 as a parameter , like @xmath53 , because that is the role it plays in the mathieu equation .",
    "we therefore have that @xmath78 mathieu s functions can , of course , be written in bloch form . in this paper",
    "we focus on the first band and so we shall suppress the band index from now on .",
    "we therefore have @xmath79 . substituting this bloch form into the time - dependent schrdinger equation as @xmath80 one obtains @xmath81 this equation",
    "can either be solved numerically from scratch , or a package such as _ mathematica _ can be used which gives the mathieu functions for each value of @xmath53 , and @xmath82 . for a particular choice of @xmath53 ,",
    "these mathieu functions can now be used in to find the value(s ) of @xmath70 that give self - consistency .",
    "there are two main differences between method 1 and method 2 described above .",
    "firstly , method 1 is a variational calculation , whereas method 2 exploits the definition of the steady state photon number to obtain a single nonlinear integral equation ( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) which must be satisfied by the atomic wave function .",
    "secondly , in method 2 we can explicitly set the band index whereas the variational wave function used in method 1 is rather more general . in spite of these differences , we find that the two methods are in complete agreement ( to within numerical accuracy ) for all the parameter ranges we were able to test ( for very deep lattices method 1 becomes unworkable because a very large number of terms in the fourier expansion are required ) .",
    "we have also checked that the two methods agree for higher bands .",
    "it may at first seem surprising that two such seemingly different methods are equivalent .",
    "we emphasize that both stem from the non - linear schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nonlineareqn ] ) , which is just mathieu s equation with a potential depth which is set self - consistently .",
    "method 1 minimizes an energy functional that is derived from this non - linear schrdinger equation . in principle",
    ", one could minimize ansatze other than the bloch functions we use here ( e.g.  localized functions ) , but these would not then satisfy the original non - linear schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nonlineareqn ] ) exactly .",
    "method 2 is based upon the observation that wave functions that satisfy the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) are precisely the required solutions of the non - linear schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nonlineareqn ] ) providing we restrict ourselves to solutions which are mathieu functions .",
    "again , one could find other types of solution , but these would not satisfy eq .  ( [ eq : nonlineareqn ] ) .",
    "an interesting question to ask is whether the nonlinearity of our problem mixes the linear bands , so that , for example the self - consistent first band is a superposition of mathieu functions from different bands .",
    "this is not what we find . instead , the solutions we have found all correspond to being from one or other band , but not a superposition .",
    "method 2 , in particular , allows us to explicitly set the band index and we are therefore able to identify all three curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pethickmethod1 ] as belonging to the first band ( we have also checked that the mathieu functions corresponding to all three curves are orthogonal to the mathieu functions for the second band for the same three lattice depths ) .",
    "actually , we do not find loops in higher bands for the parameter values considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : pethickmethod1 ] .",
    "although in this paper we restrict our attention to the first band , we have found that we can have loops in the higher bands as well .",

    "the state variables parameterize all possible paths ( not just the paths corresponding to the stationary points ) and the control parameters determine the conditions imposed on the paths .",
    "for example , if we are interested in the path(s ) which pass through the point @xmath221 in three dimensional space , then the coordinates @xmath221 form the control parameters . for a fixed set of control parameters ,",
    "the potential function defines the height of a landscape with coordinates @xmath222 .",
    "the classical paths ( rays ) are then the stationary points @xmath223 ( labelled by the index @xmath224 if there are more than one ) of this landscape , namely the mountain peaks , valley bottoms and saddles @xcite .",
    "the gradient map becomes singular when there is more than one stationary point for a given set of control parameters . in optics",
    "this is the phenomenon of focusing , because more than one ray passes through the same physical point @xmath225 , leading to a caustic .",
    "the caustic , or catastrophe , as it is known in catastrophe theory , lives in control space , which in the standard optics case is physical 3-dimensional space .",
    "as @xmath226 is varied one can explore the structure of the caustic .",
    "this is what was shown above in figures [ fig : etadelbist ] and [ fig : etadelmultistab ] , which are two dimensional slices through the parameter space @xmath196 .",
    "the crescent and swallowtail shapes are the catastrophes , whose full structure only becomes apparent when viewed in four - dimensional parameter space .",
    "catastrophes are points , lines , surfaces , and hypersurfaces in control space across which the number of solutions to the problem changes .",
    "catastrophe theory classifies these catastrophes in terms of their codimension @xmath227 , which is the difference between the dimension of the control space and the dimension of the catastrophe . for example , if we consider the two dimensional space shown in figures [ fig : etadelbist ] and [ fig : etadelmultistab ] , we find `` fold '' curves ( @xmath228 ) and `` cusp '' points ( @xmath229 ) . if we add a third dimension then we would find fold surfaces ( @xmath228 ) , cusp edges ( @xmath229 ) , and `` swallowtail '' points ( @xmath230 ) .    in order to make the foregoing discussion more concrete , consider the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuspstd ] which illustrates the cusp catastrophe .",
    "the surface shown in the figure is the state surface @xmath231 plotted in a composite of control and state space .",
    "the control space is two dimensional and is given by the @xmath232 plane at the bottom of the figure .",
    "as listed in table [ tab : catastrophe ] , the cusp catastrophe is described by a quartic potential function which , by varying the control parameters @xmath233 and @xmath234 , can be tuned between being a double or a single well potential .",
    "a prominent physical example of such quartic potential function is the thermodynamic potential in landau s phenomenological theory for continuous phase transitions @xcite @xmath235 the order parameter @xmath211 for the phase transition can be identified as the state variable .",
    "the parameter @xmath236 describes an external field , and @xmath237 and @xmath238 are functions of pressure @xmath239 and temperature @xmath240 . at first sight , it appears as though the landau potential function contains three control parameters , and so does not correspond to the cusp catastrophe . however , it is easy to see that one of the parameters is redundant because the state equation can be written in terms of only two control parameters : @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "the landau thermodynamic potential can therefore be seen to correspond to the cusp potential function .    in the present case of ultracold atoms in an optical cavity , the potential function is the reduced hamiltonian ( [ eq : energyfunctional ] ) , the state variable is the wave function @xmath43 , and the control parameters are @xmath196 .",
    "we assume that the cavity decay rate @xmath30 and number of atoms @xmath2 are constants that are unchanged throughout the analysis .",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation , obtained from the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nonlineareqn ] ) , is therefore the state equation which determines the allowed classical `` paths '' ( rays ) @xmath43 .",
    "however , because we are interested here in solutions of the bloch wave form , our `` paths '' @xmath43 are mathieu functions labelled by the quasi - momentum and the depth of the optical lattice .",
    "the quasi - momentum @xmath53 is one of the control parameters , but the depth of the optical lattice is determined uniquely , via the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) , by the number of photons in the cavity @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , we can choose to work with @xmath70 rather than @xmath43 as already discussed in section [ sec4b ] .",
    "the state equation which determines its stationary values is the self - consistency equation ( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) .",
    ".standard forms of the cuspoid catastrophes [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : catastrophe ]    the purpose of formulating our problem in terms of catastrophe theory is that we can now take advantage of a very powerful theorem @xcite .",
    "this states that there are only a strictly limited number of different forms which the potential function @xmath217 can take in the neighbourhood of a catastrophe . the first four are listed in table [ tab : catastrophe ] .",
    "note that each of the standard forms is a polynomial in @xmath211 , but is linear in the control parameters .",
    "in fact , for control spaces of dimension four or less there are only seven distinct structurally stable potential functions .",
    "three of these require two state variables , whereas we only require one state variable , so that leaves the four so - called _ cuspoid _ catastrophes , which are the ones listed in table [ tab : catastrophe ] .",
    "this remarkable result allows us to predict , at least qualitatively , the structures seen in figures [ fig : etadelbist ] and [ fig : etadelmultistab ] given only very rudimentary information such as the number of control parameters .",
    "however , the sting in the tail is that it is rare for the potential function that appears in any particular problem to already be in one of the standard forms shown in table [ tab : catastrophe ] .",
    "rather , it is generally necessary to perform various transformations upon the variables in order to manipulate the raw potential function into one of the standard forms .",
    "we already saw this for the rather simple case of the landau theory discussed above , and we shall see below that this is also true for the problem of multistability in atom - cavity systems .",
    "from table [ tab : catastrophe ] , we see that the butterfly potential function is the only one which gives up to five stationary solutions and has a four dimensional control space .",
    "we can therefore immediately say that our problem corresponds at least to a butterfly catastrophe because we have already found parameter regimes which give five solutions .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility of a higher catastrophe ( the higher catastrophes contain the lower ones , as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : cuspstd ] for the case of the cusp and the fold ) , but until we find regimes with a higher number of solutions ( and , indeed , we have not ) we shall work with the hypothesis that we are dealing with a butterfly catastrophe .",
    "we might therefore expect to find a very special point in parameter space where all five solutions merge into one ( the `` butterfly point '' ) .",
    "however , this requires us to be able to maneuver through parameter space in order to find this point . the delicate issue of whether the four experimental parameters @xmath196 can be transformed into the butterfly s four linearly independent control parameters @xmath243 , and so allow us to fully explore the butterfly catastrophe , will be studied in section [ sec : catastrophearbitrary ] below .",
    "first , we begin with the simpler case of shallow lattices .",
    "the starting point for our analysis will not be the potential function @xmath203 , which in our case is the energy functional ( [ eq : energyfunctional ] ) that explicitly depends on the atomic wave function @xmath71 and implicitly on the photon number @xmath70 .",
    "instead , we begin one step further along with the state equation which , as explained above , is provided by the self - consistency equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : selfconsphnum ] ) for the photon number .",
    "this was also the approach adopted in @xcite in order to tackle bistability in traditional laser systems .",
    "the photon numbers that satisfy the state equation for given values of the control parameters form the set of stationary points of the potential function . for our state variable",
    "we shall actually choose @xmath244 in terms of @xmath245 the state equation can be written @xmath246 where @xmath247 is evaluated in a bloch state @xmath248 , and the choice of @xmath245 as the state variable is motivated by the dependence of the bloch state on the product @xmath249 , which is the depth of the optical lattice , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : atomeqn ] ) . in the above equation",
    "we have also rescaled all frequencies by @xmath30 ( i.e.  we have divided throughout by @xmath250 and set @xmath251 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : statefn ] ) is not straightforward to analyze because we do not have a closed - form analytical expression for @xmath252 .",
    "thus , we find ourselves in the common situation , as mentioned above , that it is not obvious which standard potential function , and hence which standard state equation , corresponds to our problem .",
    "however , we have already seen in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] that when the depth of the optical lattice is small , we can perform a series expansion and obtain an approximate analytical expression for @xmath252 .",
    "this is the approach we shall follow first and we will take up the general case in the next subsection .",
    "specializing to the case of @xmath91 , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : kerrnonlin ] ) to write @xmath253 , and upon substitution into eq .",
    "( [ eq : statefn ] ) this gives @xmath254 the leading term in the above equation is cubic in the state variable @xmath245 ( similar in that respect to the classical kerr non - linearity @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore close to , but not yet identical with , the standard form of the state equation for a cusp @xmath255 complete equivalence to the cusp can be achieved by removing the quadratic term from ( [ eq : cuspnonred ] ) via the transformation @xmath256 , leading to the following values for @xmath209 and @xmath208 @xmath257 thus , we see that the canonical control parameters in the final mapping to the standard form are complicated functions of the physical control parameters @xmath258 , and @xmath116 .",
    "let us compare the above prediction to the case illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : etadelbist ] .",
    "the figure shows the number of steady state solutions for the photon number in the @xmath190 plane , for fixed values of @xmath116 and @xmath53 .",
    "the figure was calculated for @xmath91 , and the part of it close to the horizontal axis corresponds to low photon number , and so the shallow lattice theory outlined above applies in that region .",
    "we indeed find that the first derivative of the state equation vanishes at all points along the curves separating regions with one and three solutions ( this is how the curves were computed ) , which are therefore fold curves , while at the point with @xmath259 we find the second derivative also vanishes , identifying it as a cusp point where all three solutions coalesce into a single solution .",
    "we therefore find that catastrophe theory correctly accounts for the structure seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : etadelbist ] .",
    "a key point to note from the above analysis is that the underlying catastrophe that we identified had only two control parameters even though there were three `` experimental '' parameters that could be varied in the original statement of the physical problem ( we set @xmath91 ) .",
    "we met a similar situation for the landau theory of continuous phase transitions discussed above .",
    "the question then arises , how do we identify the underlying catastrophe in cases where the transformation to standard form is hard to find ?",
    "one way to proceed is via the defining character of each potential function in table [ tab : catastrophe ] , which is the highest derivative that vanishes at the most singular point . for the cusp",
    "the most singular point is @xmath260 where the first , second , and third derivatives of the potential function with respect to @xmath211 vanish .",
    "we shall take advantage of this defining character in order to tackle the general case of a lattice of arbitrary depth in the next subsection .",
    "it is worth commenting on the role of the extra dimension in control space that was present in the original statement of the shallow lattice problem , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cuspnonred ] ) .",
    "it is easy to imagine that , given a basic catastrophe , we can always embed it in a control space of higher dimension without fundamentally changing the catastrophe providing we extend it into the extra dimension in a trivial way .",
    "for example , given the cusp catastrophe that has a minimal control space which is two - dimensional , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuspstd ] , we can always add a third dimension such that the cusp becomes a structure rather like a tent , with the ridge pole being a cusp edge ( a continuous line of cusps ) .",
    "the existence of the line of cusps can be inferred from the shift of variables @xmath261 that was performed : the location of the highest singularity is parameterized by the parameter @xmath262 which is the extra control parameter .      lifting the restriction of small photon number",
    ", we define the notation @xmath263 for the left hand side of the state equation ( [ eq : statefn ] ) @xmath264 the fact that we have four experimental parameters holds out the possibility that the above state equation is that of a butterfly catastrophe ( see table  [ tab : catastrophe ] ) . furthermore , because we have already discovered regimes with five solutions , we must have at least a butterfly . however , from our experience with the shallow lattice case , we know that we may not be able to fully explore the catastrophe if some of the control parameters are trivial",
    ". we shall therefore investigate whether we can find a singular point ( the butterfly point ) where the fifth and all lower derivatives of the potential function with respect to @xmath245 simultaneously vanish ( i.e.  the fourth and lower order derivatives of @xmath263 simultaneously vanish ) and eq .",

    "we are therefore not able to navigate freely through the four - dimensional control space and locate the butterfly point at @xmath288 .",

    "in the case of shallow lattices we were able to proceed analytically and found that the structure of the solutions in parameter space when @xmath91 corresponds to a cusp catastrophe , at the most singular point of which three solutions ( two stable and one unstable ) form a pitchfork bifurcation , and this describes the onset of bistability as the laser pumping is increased .",
    "interestingly , the three experimental parameters @xmath326 reduced to just two effective control parameters . in the general case of arbitrary lattice depth and @xmath327 , the highest singularities we found were swallowtail catastrophes where four solutions simultaneously merge .",
    "the swallowtails only exist when @xmath328",
    ". however , there is good evidence that there is an underlying butterfly catastrophe , but , once again , the experimental parameters @xmath196 reduced to three effective control parameters meaning that generically one is unable to locate the butterfly point ( where five solutions simultaneously merge ) .",
    "the band structure loops found here have important implications for bloch oscillations of atoms in cavities @xcite .",
    "bloch oscillations are essentially an adiabatic effect where , as a force is applied to the atoms they remain in the same band but their quasi - momentum evolves linearly in time , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bo ] ) .",
    "swallowtail loops in the band structure will have a deleterious effect on bloch oscillations because , as the quasi - momentum evolves , the atoms will reach the edge of a loop where the branch they are following vanishes .",
    "this will lead to a sudden , non - adiabatic , disruption in the state of the atoms as they are forced to jump to another branch or even another band .",
    "for becs in ordinary static optical lattices these non - adiabatic jumps are thought to be the cause of the destruction of superfluidity during bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "we have not included interactions in our treatment ( interactions are necessary for superfluidity ) , but related effects will likely occur , especially considering the added heating due to the fact that the lattice depth will also abruptly change at the same point .",
    "however , when the loop detaches from the main band it will no longer affect bloch oscillations .",
    "furthermore , loops only occur for certain limited regions of parameter space , i.e. inside the cusp and swallowtail catastrophes shown in figs [ fig : etadelbist ] , [ fig : etadelmultistab ] , and [ fig : swallowtail ] . for experiments involving bloch oscillations we therefore recommend that parameter regimes are chosen which lie outside to these regions .",
    "finally , we add that although we have only considered bloch waves in this paper , localized states ( for example wannier functions ) can be formed from superpositions of bloch waves with different values of the quasi - momentum . in this sense",
    ", localized states therefore contain all values of the quasi - momentum and so might be expected to display tristability too .",
    "however , it should be borne in mind that the nonlinearity of the system means that superpositions of bloch states of different @xmath53 but the same lattice depth will not in general obey the effective schrdinger equation ( [ eq : nonlineareqn ] ) .",
