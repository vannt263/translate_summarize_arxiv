    "many efforts have increasingly been made over the last century to describe and characterize the nature of the insterstellar medium ( ism ) of our galaxy .",
    "on the theoretical side some concepts proposed by @xcite have been of primary importance by providing a useful mathematical framework from which the ism has firstly been described as an ideal magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulent fluid . from the observational point of view",
    ", the wide span of temperatures and densities has been divided in various ranges designated as components or phases of the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) within which various structures like large - scale structures of bubble walls , sheets and filaments of warm gas , subsheets and filaments of cold dense material , have been classified .",
    "following the evolution of the observational technics and the increasing amount of data they have been providing , various models and more recently mhd numerical simulations have been explored in an attempt to explain and predict the dynamic evolution of the ism and the formation of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "the formation and evolution of gmcs is still a subject of strong debate .",
    "one of the main issues is to unveil the conditions that will lead to formation of cores ; the cradles where star formation takes place .",
    "two classes of models for explaining gmc formation have been proposed .",
    "the top - down models investigate the formation of gmcs as triggered by large - scale gravitational , thermal and magnetic instabilities in the differential rotating disk of a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on smaller scales ,",
    "the bottom - up models explore formation of gmcs by compression of substructures of the ism by supernova remnants , shocks produced by superbubbles or compression in converging flows in the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these shocks can ultimately trigger star formation in these regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "molecular clouds and star - forming regions and the physical characterization of the finite structures and sub - structures of gmcs are the main purpose of this work .",
    "they are part of the dense cold gas phase of the ism characterized by densities above about 10 @xmath2 and temperatures below 100 k. while the amount of dust grains pervading such regions is only about 1@xmath3 of the gas mass , their polarized thermal emission observed at submillimeter ( submm ) wavelengths provides crucial information regarding the magnetic fields .",
    "based on current advancements it is believed that some of the dust grains are elongated and have a specific orientation with respect to the local magnetic field they are pervading , therefore submm polarimetry gives us information about the average magnetic field along the observed line - of - sights ( loss ) .",
    "@xcite gives an interesting review about the advancements of dust grain alignment theory ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite referred to visible polarimetry and interpreted the large scale dispersion of the magnetic field observed in the galactic plane as fluctuations of the magnetic field lines departing from a well ordered galactic plane uniform component .",
    "based on mhd arguments they established a relation where the velocity of the transverse velocity wave is proportional to the intensity of the magnetic field and inversely proportional to the square root of the density of the medium , leading to estimates of the field strength of order of 1 - 10 @xmath0 g .",
    "this chandrasekhar and fermi ( cf ) method became popular and has been lately transposed to smaller spatial scales in clouds envelopes and cores where submm polarimetry has made possible to probe the mean magnetic field orientation in structures 5 orders of magnitude denser than the difuse ism .",
    "many analyses lead to estimates of the average plane of the sky ( pos ) component magnetic field strengths 2 - 3 order of magnitude higher than in the difuse ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently the cf method with mhd simulations has been investigated and correction factors to the cf equation have been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to polarimetry , spectroscopy has been providing valuable information for characterizing the magneto - turbulent properties of some clouds from the point of view of the gas ; generally in their densest regions which allow for sensitive detections .",
    "estimates of magnetic field intensities along some los have been successfully obtained by zeeman effect measurements in various regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the goldreich - kylafis effect @xcite has also been successfully measured which shows that co isotopes can also be polarized with magnetic field orientations consistent with the ones inferred from polarized emission by dust grains at the scale of some cores ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or at galactic scales @xcite . using another complete different approach ,",
    "emission spectroscopy of ions and neutrals from molecular clouds has been compared and analyzed @xcite .",
    "based on reasonable assumptions , such analysis and further developements make possible to calculate the turbulent ambipolar scale in some regions @xcite which give important piece of evidence to theoretical arguments @xcite .",
    "such studies also provide important constraints on further modeling to explain how magnetic fields and turbulence combine with each other to slow down gravitational collapse in molecular clouds ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we propose a new method for characterizing the magneto - turbulent properties of the envelopes of some galactic molecular clouds ; by envelopes we mean the sub - structures of the molecular clouds that surround the embedded cores .",
    "this method is based on the comparison of parameters extracted from the analysis of observed submm polarization maps ( section [ data ] ) with a similar set of parameters extracted from simulated maps ( section [ simulations ] ) .",
    "the results obtained with our method are discussed and compared with other published analyses ( section [ discussion ] ) .",
    "the data are from the scupol catalog provided by @xcite .",
    "the 1024@xmath4 synthetic cubes obtained from three - dimensional ( 3d ) mhd simulations of the turbulent ism which were used for making the maps follow the description given by @xcite .",

    "a summary of our results and our conclusions are given in section [ summary ] .",
    "the data discussed in this work come from the scupol catalog produced by @xcite .",
    "this catalog is the product of the analysis of all regions observed between 1997 and 2005 at 850 @xmath0 m in the mapping mode with scupol , the polarimeter for scuba on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",

    "the various fields cover 1 region in the galactic center , 48 star forming regions ( sfrs ) , 11 young stellar objects ( ysos ) , 6 starless prestellar cores ( spcs ) , 9 bok globules , 2 post agb stars , 2 planetary nebula , 2 supernova remnants and 2 galaxies .      all maps with a sample of detection lower than 30 pixels are systematically considered too small to be statistically significant and are not included in our analysis .",
    "this implies that all regions classified as bok globules , post agb stars and planetary nebula are not included .",
    "since our work is mainly focused on star - forming and molecular cloud regions the targets of the catalog classified as supernova remnants and galaxies are also not included into our analysis but the highly sampled galactic center region is for comparison with sfrs , ysos and spcs regions .",
    "some of the sfrs , ysos and spcs regions were rejected when the sample or the spatial distribution of the pixels was not allowing to make a proper second order structure function analysis of the polarization map ( see section [ tad ] ) .",

    "in this section we introduce the various parameters inferred from the analysis of the polarization maps ; i.e. the scupol catalog s i , q and u stokes maps and the uncertainty maps provided by @xcite .",
    "the parameters are used to characterize each observed region .",

    "dealing with linear polarization maps one commonly defines the means and the dispersions of the polarization degree and of the polarization position angle distributions . since the polarization position angle is a variable that wraps over itself the averages retained in our analysis correspond to the means obtained where the dispersions of the distributions are found to be the smallest .",
    "this method of calculation helps one to avoid to make any assumption about the combination of a simple or multiple gaussian distribution that would characterize the large scale uniform magnetic field component and a random distribution that would characterize the turbulent magnetic field component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the definitions of the polarization degree , @xmath6 , and of the polarization angle @xmath15 and the uncertainty maps of @xmath7 and @xmath16 follow equations ( 1)-(5 ) of @xcite .",

    "it shows values of @xmath21 lying between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the histogram of the mean galactic polarization position angles of the same set of data is shown in figure [ sfr_thetameanhisto ] .",
    "it shows an avoidance of low pas and suggests a broad peak , but given the small size of our sample ( n=27 objects ) it could also be indicative of no specific orientation of the mean magnetic field orientations with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "such a comparison is actually out of the scope of the present work , but we find that our result could be consistent with the conclusions of the detailed analysis conducted by @xcite on a sample of 52 galactic star forming regions observed at 350 @xmath0 m .",
    "the variations of the polarization degree , @xmath6 , with the flux density , @xmath24 , of dust grains emission is generally described by a power - law relation of the form @xmath25 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in general the power index , @xmath26 , is negative which translates as a decrease of the polarization with an increase of the intensity .",
    "this parameter is well suited to characterize the well - known `` polarization hole '' problem frequently observed along filaments with embedded cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , whatever the value it will take ( positive or negative ) , in the following we refer to this parameter as the depolarization parameter . at the scale of a molecular cloud @xmath26 takes different values according to whether the analysis considers the envelopes or the cores @xcite .",
    "initially , we systematically make estimates of @xmath26 for each map of the regions in the sample .",
    "the values are displayed in column 7 of table [ table_regions ] .",
    "we find strong variations of @xmath26 .",
    "the lowest value is @xmath27 in the yso l43 and the highest value , a positive one , is @xmath28 in the sfr omc-1 .",
    "more discussion on the variation of this parameter with column density variations is provided in section [ simstats ] .",
    "the second - order structure function ( sf ) of the polarization angles obtained with measurements in the far - infrared - submm domain was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "the sf gives the measurements of the autocorrelation of the polarization position angles @xmath29 as a function of the distance @xmath30 measured for all pair of points into a map .",
    "the square - root of the sf , also called the angular dispersion function ( adf ) , can be used for determining the dispersion of magnetic field vectors about large - scale fields in turbulent molecular clouds as it has been firstly proposed by @xcite , theoretically , and @xcite and @xcite with applications on the regions omc-1 , m17 and dr21 . for applications on other regions see , for example , @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we systematically use this method on the sample of regions shown in table [ table_regions ] .",
    "the values of the turbulent angular dispersion parameter , @xmath31 , which is the total angular dispersion determined by the intercept of the fit to the adf at @xmath32 is shown in column 8 of the table .",
    "examples of the fitting are shown with the plots in figure [ plotsf ] for regions s106 , w49 , dr21 and omc-2/3 . for these regions ,",
    "the physical scales sampled are of size of about 29 , 553 , 145 and 40 mpc , respectively . the effective beam size being of @xmath33 , the fits have to be obtained on points with values of @xmath29 estimated at @xmath30 about equal or greater than the effective beam size",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , for the maps which pixels are of size @xmath34 ( e.g. omc-2/3 ) the models were fitted on the first two point of the plots . for most of the other maps",
    "which pixels are of size @xmath35 ( e.g. s106 , w49 and dr21 ) the model was fitted on the estimates of the angular dispersions obtained at @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "having parameter @xmath31 we used equation ( 7 ) of @xcite to estimate the ratio of the turbulent to the large scale magnetic field , @xmath38 , which is given in column 9 of table [ table_regions ] .",
    "we find estimates of @xmath31 lying between @xmath39 in ngc 2024 and @xmath40 in mon iras 12 implying turbulent to large scale magnetic field ratios lying between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we point out that the values of @xmath43 shown in the last column of table [ table_regions ] do not take into account the effect of the signal integration through the thickness of the cloud across the area subtended by the telescope beam .",
    "correction of such effects has been proposed by @xcite , but we are not using their method at this stage of our analysis . in the following ,",
    "we adopt a complementary point of view , and rather than trying to remove the effects mentioned above , we directly compare the sets of parameters ( @xmath21 , @xmath44 , @xmath26 and @xmath31 ) extracted from the observed maps to similar sets of parameters inferred from synthetic maps that have been obtained from 3d mhd simulations scaled to the observations .",
    "this analysis is presented in section [ simulations ] .",
    "+          to study possible effects due to the combination of distance with map coverage , we define the normalized distance multiplied by the normalized number of pixels of our sample , @xmath45 .",
    "the variation of parameters @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath31 and @xmath26 obtained for the sfrs sample ( n=21 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath45 in figure [ par_vs_dist_npix ] .",
    "linear fits to the distributions are plotted with dashed - lines showing very smooth variations of each parameter for values of @xmath46 .",
    "also shown with square symbols are the averages of the data in bins of size equal 7 . once binned",
    "the data also show very smooth variations for increasing values of @xmath45 .",
    "our interpretation of these results is that the sample of sfrs is , at first approximation , quite homogeneous with respect to the distance to each source combined with the number of pixels in each map , therefore the combined effects of the distance and of the map pixels sample size should introduce only a negligible statistical bias in our analysis , if any .",
    "we rather expect that the variations of the parameters obtained from one region to the other are primarily based on physical effects taking place in each region .",
    "the averaged values of the parameters discussed in the preceeding section are displayed in table [ table_statistics_regions ] for several subset regions .",
    "as mentionned previously , the galactic center is considered as a subset itself .",
    "the subset of yso regions ( n@xmath47 regions ) and the subset of spcs ( n@xmath48 ) regions are obviously too small to be statistically significant , but they are used for comparisons with the larger subset of sfr regions ( n@xmath49 ) and in the following of this section we will focus mainly on this subset .    the variations of @xmath21 with @xmath31 are shown in figure [ pmean_vs_b ] for the 4 subset regions . the subset of sfrs shows large variations of @xmath21 with @xmath31 centered on the averaged values @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the plots suggest a slight increase of @xmath21 with the increase of @xmath31 , however , since the statistical analysis conducted by @xcite suggests that the magnetic field in molecular clouds is decoupled from the large scale galactic magnetic field , we interpret the trend observed in the upper right part of figure [ pmean_vs_b ] to be rather statistical in nature .",
    "similarly , we do not find any correlation between parameters @xmath26 and @xmath31 which is shown in figure [ gamma_vs_b ] , and between parameters @xmath26 and @xmath21 which is shown in figures [ gamma_vs_pmean ] .",
    "for the subset of sfrs , the distribution of @xmath26 is centered on @xmath52 with a dispersion of @xmath53 .",
    "the variations of @xmath31 with @xmath20 are shown in figure [ b_vs_stheta ] .",
    "the dashed line shows the location where the two parameters are equal .",
    "we find values of @xmath31 always lower or equal to those of @xmath20 and , as expected with the methods used to derive the two parameters , none of the regions show values of @xmath54 .",
    "for the subset of sfrs the values of the turbulent angular dispersion @xmath31 are approximately three times smaller than the values of the dispersions around the global magnetic fields @xmath20 . according to",
    "whether one uses @xmath31 or @xmath20 such variations in the ratio of @xmath55 will introduce variations in the products of the chandrasekhar & fermi method @xcite . since @xmath31 should be more accurate a parameter than @xmath20 to estimate the small scale angular dispersion of a region , in the following we will use @xmath31 for determining the pos angular dispersion more generally expressed by @xmath56 .",
    "@xcite defined a method for estimating the strength of the pos magnetic field component , @xmath57 , based on the pos angular dispersion , @xmath56 and the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath58 , of the gas of mass density , @xmath59 .",
    "the turbulence of the medium is supposed to be isotropic and the gas to be coupled to the alfvnic perturbations , so that equipartition between the kinetic and the perturbed magnetic energies is required .",
    "the alfvn speed is given by @xmath60 and , in the small angle limit , the ratio between the mean turbulent magnetic field component in the pos , @xmath61 , and the uniform component of the magnetic field , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 in this case ) , is given by @xmath64    @xcite conducted 3d magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of turbulent interstellar medium regions to create synthetic 2d polarization maps .",
    "their results show that equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies is a fulfilled assumption for sub - alfvnic models ( i.e. , for models where the turbulent velocity is smaller than the alfvn velocity ) as well as for super - alfvnic models after a few crossing times . following @xcite they proposed @xmath65 with @xmath66 to take into account @xmath61 and to avoid the small angle approximation .",
    "@xmath67 is a correction factor proposed by @xcite based on their mhd simulations .",
    "these authors conclude that @xmath68 is deemed appropriate in most cases to estimate @xmath57 to the condition that the field is not too weak .",
    "shortcomings of the cf method are discussed by @xcite and a few technical and physical reasons are given to explain this correction factor .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the second order sf to make a two dimensional analysis of polarization maps and derived the following expression @xmath69    combining equation [ cf1 ] with equation [ cf3 ] or equation [ cf4 ] gives the general relation @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( equation [ cf2 ] ) , @xmath72 ( equation [ cf2 ] at small angle limit ) or @xmath73 ( equation [ cf4 ] ) .",
    "as a numerical check we used the values of @xmath74 displayed in table [ table_regions ] to plot the variations of @xmath75 and @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 in figure [ ratios ] . the correction factor @xmath78",
    "is used in the process and we find good agreement between the 2 ratios for angular dispersions lying between @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for comparisons",
    "the small angle limit ratio @xmath81 is shown by the dashed - line .",
    "discrepancies between the 3 ratios appear for angular dispersions higher than @xmath82 . in this domain range ,",
    "the cf method based on equation [ cf2 ] gives values higher than the small angle limit method while the cf method based on the sf approach and equation [ cf4 ] returns lower values than those obtained with the small angle limit method .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy was pointed by @xcite . a key argument in their modeling is that the amplitude of the underlying reference magnetic field is also perturbed by the turbulent field , and the values of the uniform components are typically smaller than previously estimated by a factor that equals the turbulent component ( see discussion below ) .",
    "zeeman splitting measurements are available for some of the regions of the scupol catalog .",
    "the data we refer to come from a survey conducted by @xcite including emission and absorption observations , as well as vla synthesis observations .",
    "the analysis provides averaged los magnetic field strengths on the area sustended by the beams unless the targets are point source like .    for the regions where polarimetry obtained with scuba and zeeman measurements provided by @xcite",
    "are both available , we have combined the densities and velocity dispersions values obtained from table 1 of @xcite with our estimates of @xmath31 shown in table [ table_regions ] and equation [ cf4 ] was used for estimating averaged pos magnetic field intensity components over the area of the clouds .",
    "a summary of the data used in the process is shown in table [ table_bfields ] .",
    "the los magnetic field components estimated by crutcher are displayed in column 1 and our estimates of the pos components are shown in column 4 ( see values with no parenthesis ) .",
    "we find a mean ratio of 4.7 between the pos and los magnetic field components obtained with the two methods .",
    "the sample shows a dispersion to the mean of 2.8 .",
    "several arguments could explain why our estimates of b@xmath83b@xmath84 are systematically greater than one .",
    "a first naive one could be that we are probing magnetic fields in a sample of clouds where the large scale uniform component is always closer to the pos ( @xmath85 ) than to the los .",
    "one another possibility could be that the areas subtended to estimate @xmath86 with each method , if too much different , would introduce a bias on the estimates of b@xmath83b@xmath84 . to look on this side , we made calculations of the ratio of the areas covered by polarimetry and by spectroscopy , respectively .",
    "appendix a of @xcite and references therein were used to define the values of the map areas observed for making zeeman splitting estimates .",
    "for single - antenna observations of absorption lines toward continuum sources that are smaller than the telescope beam , the effective resolution is the angular size of the source therefore , we give the ratio between the map areas a value of one for these sources .",
    "the values of the ratios between the areas of the polarimetry and spectroscopy maps are shown in column 6 of table [ table_bfields ] .",
    "we find a mean ratio of 13.2 between the areas used to make pos and los magnetic field components estimates , respectively .",
    "the sample has a large dispersion to the mean of 13.9 .",
    "figure [ bratiosmaps ] shows the distribution of the magnetic fields ratio as a function of the map areas ratio .",
    "if a bias on b@xmath83b@xmath84 was introduced by an increasing ratio between the areas observed with polarimetry and with spectroscopy , one could expect a correlation between the two ratios .",
    "this seems not to be the case but we also point out how limited would be any conclusion with such a small sample .",
    "one another argument to explain the high values of b@xmath83b@xmath84 is that the zeeman measurements could be subject to magnetic field reversals toward the los ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which is an effect to which the cf method should be completely blinded to .",
    "in such a case the estimates of b@xmath84 should be considered as lower limits .",
    "in addition , los magnetic field components , as well as the parameters displayed in table [ table_bfields ] are subject to spatial averaging effects @xcite so that the same values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 for estimating the pos and los sky magnetic field components likely introduced a bias in our analysis . as an example , if one refers to the high resolution estimates of the inclination angles with the los , @xmath1 , for dr21 obtained by @xcite , inclination angles are found to lie between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , while combining our values of b@xmath84 and b@xmath91 gives an inclination angle of about @xmath92 .",
    "actually , it is not clear , whether or not , oh or co isotopologues trace similar gas densities as dust . in addition , optically thin transition of molecular ion like , h@xmath93co@xmath94(j=3 - 2 ) , might be more appropriate for determining velocity dispersions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a survey of h@xmath93co@xmath94(j=3 - 2 ) published data gives velocity dispersion values of 1.85 km / s @xcite for omc-1 , about 0.68 km / s ( * ? ? ?",
    "* once data plotted in their figure 5 are averaged ) for ngc 2024 , about 0.58 km / s @xcite for rho oph a toward the core n6 , and of 2.04 km / s @xcite for dr21 ( oh1 ) and dr21 ( oh2 ) .",
    "those values are of order one to three times higher than the ones obtained from co or oh data , which means magnetic field intensities b@xmath91 of order one to three times higher than the ones obtained from co or oh when densities similar to the one displayed with no parenthesis in table [ table_bfields ] are used for the calculations , or even higher if one systematically considers densities @xmath95 @xmath2 ( see data with parenthesis ) . on the other hand , except for ngc 2024 ,",
    "most of the h@xmath93co@xmath94(j=3 - 2 ) data have been obtained toward cores and might be not representative of the averaged values one would get from observations of this tracer over the area sustended by the clouds , for that reason we consider both cases , i.e. constraints on b@xmath91 and therefore on @xmath1 , as obtained from co , oh or from h@xmath93co@xmath94(j=3 - 2 ) ; see values given with no and with parenthesis in table [ table_bfields ] , respectively .",
    "in addition , as was discussed by @xcite , the probability density functions used for comparing @xmath96 and b@xmath83b@xmath97 are such that half the time , b@xmath83b@xmath98 , which makes b@xmath91 a better tracer of b@xmath97 than does b@xmath84 . following this line of thought",
    ", we could consider our estimates of b@xmath99 as upper limits and we expect the estimates of b@xmath84 to be lower limits .",
    "we have displayed our estimates of @xmath1 in the last column of table [ table_bfields ] , but considering the arguments above those should be considered only as upper limits .    finally , it is possible that the pos magnetic field is systematically overestimated , depending on the turbulent regime .",
    "therefore , we also present in table [ table_bfields ] values of b@xmath100 , as estimated from equation [ cf3 ] . large differences between b@xmath100 and b@xmath99 , based on @xcite , is likely to occur for dispersions @xmath101 .",
    "the values differ from a factor of 3 up to more than one order of magnitude .",
    "for example , the value obtained for omc-1 is very high compared to the much smaller @xmath102 g obtained by houde et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using the same technique but by correcting for signal integration through the depth of the cloud and across the telescope beam - in better agreement with the estimate b@xmath103 g .",
    "it is not clear though the actual significance of each method since the values of b@xmath100 for w49 and s106 seem too low and do not correspond well to the alfvn turbulent component provided from the simulations , as explained in the next section .",
    "we must point that despite of the apparent overestimation of b@xmath99 in the cases of omc-1 and dr21 , these values , combined with b@xmath84 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 shown in table [ table_bfields ] , are in good agreement with the alfvnic turbulence obtained from the numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite modeled the statistics of polarized emission from dust grains based on mhd numerical simulations , and showed its strong dependence on the turbulent regime of the host molecular clouds . from an observational perspective then it is possible to estimate the turbulent regime of a given molecular cloud , as well as the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the plane of sky , by comparing the statistics of the observed polarization maps to those obtained by numerical simulations with similar scaling .      in order to estimate the magnetic field and turbulent regimes of part of the sample of the objects mentioned before",
    ", we performed a number of mhd numerical simulations of turbulence in molecular clouds , each of them related to a specific set of initial conditions chosen to best reproduce the observations of a given object .",
    "the problem of magnetic turbulence in molecular clouds can be solved by a fluid approximation governed by the isothermal ideal mhd equations of the form :    @xmath106    @xmath107 = { \\bf f},\\ ] ]    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    where @xmath59 , @xmath111 and @xmath6 are the plasma density , velocity and pressure , respectively , @xmath112 is the magnetic field , @xmath113 is the vector potential and @xmath114 represents the external source terms , responsible for the turbulence injection .",
    "we solve the mhd equations above using a high order shock - capturing godunov - type scheme @xcite based on a multi - state harten - lax - van leer ( hlld ) riemann solver for the isothermal mhd equations and a 4th order runge - kutta ( rk ) scheme for time integration .",
    "the divergence of the magnetic field is kept close to zero by using a field interpolated constraint transport ( ct ) scheme on a staggered grid , and periodic boundaries .",
    "turbulence is driven by a solenoidal and , therefore incompressible forcing , in fourier space , and random in time .",
    "the choice of the initial setup of the simulations depends on the observational data and is described below .",
    "the turbulent regime of a given run is determined by the rms of the sonic and alfvenic mach numbers calculated for the entire cube .",
    "statistically the regime is therefore , mostly related to the amplitude of the fluctuations at the injection scale . in the ism ,",
    "the injection of kinetic energy is believed to occur at scales larger than 10pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ism turbulence presents a selfsimilar cascade over several decades on lengthscales , from injection down to sub - au scales where dissipation occurs .",
    "the numerical simulations in a fixed grid of @xmath115 cells present turbulent scales that goes from the largest scales of energy injection in the ism ( @xmath116pc ) to the dissipation scales ( @xmath117pc ) , where the last is basically related to numerical diffusivity or other physical mechanisms , e.g. on the ambipolar diffusion ( see falceta - gonalves et al . 2010 , falceta - gonalves & lazarian 2011 ) . on the other hand , the observed turbulent scales of the molecular clouds lie in between the injection and the dissipation scales , i.e. few parsecs in length .",
    "for obvious reasons , it is impossible to use one single simulation to compare all observational data and some sort of sampling of the numerical data is required .    in order to properly select the model parameters",
    "the determination of the dynamical range of scales of a given observed cloud is crucial . for that we may make use of the assumption that the molecular cloud observed corresponds to part of the inertial range scales of a self - similar ism turbulence .",
    "the turbulence at the largest scales presents typical amplitudes of @xmath118 ( larson 1980 ) , being @xmath119 the isothermal sound speed for @xmath120k .",
    "also , the kolmogorov s model of turbulence gives the scaling of velocity amplitudes as @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , combining the large scale amplitude with the given scaling it is possible to predict the turbulent amplitudes at any given lengthscale @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , the region s106 is @xmath122pc wide , therefore the turbulent amplitude at its largest scale will be approximately given by @xmath123 .",
    "regarding the numerical resolution used in comparing the cubes to the observed data one needs to determine the dynamical range of the turbulent motions given by @xmath124 , where @xmath125 represents the largest of either the dissipation or the spatially resolved lengthscales .",
    "the dynamical range should be the same for the numerical and observational data ( see falceta - gonalves et al .",
    "2008 ) . as an example",
    ", s106 presents @xmath126pc , which gives @xmath127 .",
    "since the numerical diffusion causes the damping of the turbulence at scales of @xmath128 cells , it is only possible to simulate the observed polarization maps if the numerical resolution is of @xmath115 cells . combining the determined turbulence amplitude at the given scale of s106 , and its dynamical range",
    ", we use a numerical setup with mach number equals 2 and a numerical grid of @xmath115 resolution .",
    "the same analysis has been repeated to omc2 - 3 , w49 and dr21 , resulting in a total of 4 different setups for the numerical simulations ( table [ table_models_0p30 ] ) . for the initial magnetic field",
    "we assume a uniform field , whose amplitude is equal to the equipartition value at the largest scale , i.e. @xmath129 .    interestingly , the values of sonic and alfvenic mach numbers presented in table [ table_models_0p30 ] , obtained assuming a self - similar turbulent cascade from the large ism scales down to the scales of the omc-2/3 , dr21 , s106 and w49 regions , are in good agreement , within a factor of two , with the observational estimates made by @xcite based on zeeman measurements .      in order to compare the statistics of the observed regions with the numerical simulations we have to calculate the synthetic polarization maps for these data . here",
    "we use an approximate radiative transfer model , in which we assume that the radiation is originated exclusively by thermal emission from dust grains and the medium to be optically thin to this radiation .",
    "the dust abundance is supposed to be linearly proportional to the gas density , and the dust particles distribution to be isothermal .",
    "naturally the alignment of prolate and oblate dust particles with respect to the magnetic field lines is not perfect in molecular clouds .",
    "the physical mechanisms of grain alignment are not in the scope of this study , so we assume a constant polarization efficiency , @xmath130 , for starting .",
    "the local , i.e. in each cell , angle of alignment ( @xmath131 ) is determined by the local magnetic field projected into the plane of sky , and the linear polarization stokes parameters @xmath132 and @xmath133 are given by :    @xmath134    where @xmath59 is the local density and @xmath135 is the inclination of the local magnetic field with respect to the line of sight .",
    "we then obtain the integrated @xmath132 and @xmath133 , as well as the column density , along the los .",
    "the polarization degree is given by @xmath136 and the polarization angle by @xmath137 .",
    "once projected into a given line of sight , the polarization map is related to the synthetic emission map .",
    "the numerical simulations do not include the effects produced by gravity , but we expect they are very well suited for characterizing the turbulent regimes into the envelopes",
    ". on the other hand , high density clumps , as well as other large emission pixels related to superimposed clouds along the line of sight , may contaminate the statistics of models and more particularly observational data .",
    "therefore , after scaling of the dynamical range of the simulations , a variation study of the space parameter of the observed maps is investigated to remove high density regions of the filaments where cores are generally forming .    in order to avoid a bias related to rare very large emission pixels we studied the variations of the statistical parameters of the polarization maps @xmath31 , @xmath26 , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , in terms of the column density contrast parameter , cdc = ( flux@xmath138 - flux@xmath139)/flux@xmath138 . as an example , the variations of the four parameters obtained from the observed map of omc-2/3 are plotted in figure [ var_omc23 ] as a function of cdc ( more details about the method are given by * ? ? ?",
    "variations of parameter @xmath140 are given for illustration purpose only since , following the analysis given in section 2.4 , parameter @xmath31 is the parameter suited for analyzing the effects of the turbulence at the resolution of the observations .",
    "for estimating the values of the parameters that will be fitted by the simulations we need to identify the pixels that will be masked into the polarization maps . to do so we first look to the variations of @xmath26 with the cdc . for the omc-2/3 regions @xmath26 decreases drastically from cdc @xmath141 to cdc @xmath142 , but is quite constant for values of cdc @xmath143 .",
    "we therefore adopt a limit value of the cdc of @xmath144 to define the values of the parameters we will use for comparing the omc-2/3 region with simulations .",
    "the same strategy is followed for regions s106 , w49 and dr21 .",
    "the new values of @xmath26 , @xmath31 and @xmath21 extracted from the observed maps that will be compared with the values of the same parameters obtained from the analysis of simulated maps are displayed in table [ ang_sum ] .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the statistics of polarization maps is largely related to the turbulent regime of the cloud and to the orientation of the mean magnetic field with respect to the line of sight @xmath1 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore , once the turbulent regime has been chosen ( from the scaling discussed above ) , we must study the dependence of the statistics of the polarization maps with @xmath1 and compare them to the observations .",
    "this procedure allows us to constrain the orientation of the magnetic field from the statistical parameters derived from the analysis of the polarization maps .",
    "in figure [ plotssim ] we present @xmath145 and @xmath146 as extracted from the simulated maps in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear the relation of the average polarization and the decorrelation parameter @xmath145 with respect to the projection angle @xmath1 . for @xmath147 ,",
    "most of the polarization arises from the random turbulent component of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the depolarization effect due to the integration of the non - uniform component along the los is enhanced .",
    "also , the decorrelation length for the structure function of the magnetic field vectors decreases and @xmath145 increases . as @xmath148 , the polarization degree increases , and as the decorrelation length increases @xmath145 decreases .",
    "we found a very similar trend for both @xmath145 and @xmath149 with respect to the orientation of the los .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath150 and @xmath151 obtained from the analysis of the observations ( see table 5 ) are shown with horizontal dashed lines in figure [ plotssim ] .",
    "there is no perfect match of @xmath1 values obtained for each of the statistical parameters , as it may be related to biases induced by dense structures that still contribute for the synthetic maps . with a constant polarization efficiency , @xmath130 , for dr21 , the observed values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 are obtained for @xmath152 .",
    "similar comparisons done for w49 , lead to @xmath153 . for s106 , we find @xmath154 . for omc2/3",
    ", we estimate @xmath155 .    for every region ,",
    "we find values of @xmath156 , therefore it is not possible to put any constraint on the angle @xmath1 with this parameter .",
    "more discussion about this aspect of our work is given in the next section .",
    "since we focused the modeling of polarization statistics on the turbulent regime of the studied regions we deliberately avoided the use of self - gravity and radiative cooling . for the molecular gas ,",
    "radiative cooling plays a minor role in the evolution of the turbulent motions and the statistics of the dense structures , and result in very little variations in local temperatures in the range of @xmath157k .",
    "self - gravity , on the other hand , plays a major role on the smaller scale dynamics of the molecular clouds , resulting in their fragmentation and collapse of jeans unstable cores .",
    "we tried to remove possible effects of the cores by removing the largest column density pixels out of the statistical study and , as shown before , the parameters @xmath158 , @xmath21 and @xmath31 are only slightly sensitive to that process . in this sense , except for parameter @xmath26 which will be discussed more in the following , our analysis does not rely on parameters which are too sensitive to the structures of the cloud considered .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ var_omc23 ] where variations of parameters @xmath31 , @xmath21 and even @xmath44 are quite smooth as the cdc parameter decreases .    from the point of view of dust grains ,",
    "our simulations do not take into account possible variations of @xmath6 with parameters @xmath159 , t@xmath160 and @xmath161 , i.e. the wavelength of dust grain emission , the dust grain temperature and the dust grain emissivity index , respectively .",
    "variations of dust grains size and / or variations of dust grains axis ratio , whether their shape is oblate or prolate on average , or non ideal , are also not included explicitly .",
    "nevertheless all this infotmation is statistically and implicitly included in the choice of the value for parameter @xmath162 used in equation [ eq_qu ] to make our numerical calculations .",
    "we will see in the next section that a value of @xmath163 is a reasonable statistical value to describe the turbulent states of the systems investigated .",
    "two variants of the definition of the polarization efficiency parameter ( or polarization reduction factor ) have been described and used up to now .",
    "they have been mainly proposed by theoreticians based on the fact that the measured linearly polarized signal , as supposed to be produced by layers of aligned dust grains , whether in emission or by dichroic extinction , seems never to exceed a given threshold . in the submm range , which is the domain of wavelengths we are interested ,",
    "this threshold is often considered to be around a value of 10 @xmath3 based on ground - based or airborne experiment observations of sufficiently bright star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while maxima lying between 10 @xmath3 to 20 @xmath3 are expected in more diffuse regions of the ism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the general definition of the polarization efficiency parameter is given by : @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the polarization reduction due to the turbulent component of the magnetic field and @xmath166 is the angle between the pos and the local direction of the magnetic field while @xmath167 is the rayleigh polarization reduction factor .",
    "in the first variant of the definition provided by @xcite , @xmath167 is defined as : @xmath168 where @xmath161 is the angle between the grain angular momentum vector and the magnetic field . in this case",
    "@xmath167 translates as a constant imperfect alignment in the reference frame of each dust grain .",
    "a second definition for @xmath167 has been proposed by @xcite such that : @xmath169 where , @xmath170 is the dust grain cross section , @xmath171 is the dust grain size , @xmath172 is the grain number density , @xmath173 is the minimum size , @xmath174 is the maximum size , and @xmath175 is the minimum aligned size .",
    "this second definition differs from the first one in the sense that @xmath167 is now defined as a function of the distribution in size of the grains .",
    "environment effects are very important and the central idea is that non symetrical grains can be radiatively aligned by torques ( radiative alignment by torques or rats , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) produced by energy transfer on dust grains during their interaction with the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) . in particular big grains could be perfectly aligned by this process .",
    "one can now compare those definitions with the assumptions used in and the calculations done with our simulations .",
    "comparison of equations [ eq_qu ] and [ eq_phi ] shows that @xmath176 , i.e. all simulated dust grains located in a cell of density @xmath59 are identically aligned by a local magnetic field which orientation makes an angle @xmath166 with the pos .",
    "the effects of the turbulence as described by parameter f in equation [ eq_phi ] are directly estimated with our simulations , and the rayleigh parameter @xmath167 whether it is described by equation [ eq_rgreen ] or [ eq_rlaz ] , can therefore be identified to our parameter @xmath162 shown in equation [ eq_qu ] .    in this context",
    "our choice of value for @xmath162 , identified as the maximum polarization degree that could be measured at a given wavelength , should be interpreted as the case where optimal ideal physical conditions are encountered in the ism . or in other words ,",
    "the maximum polarization degree observed at 850 @xmath0 m in the scupol catalog would be the maximum value measured if the large scale magnetic field were uniform , lying in a plane almost parallel to the pos and largely dominating over the turbulent field .",
    "in such a case we would , therefore , have @xmath177 .",
    "following this line of thought we looked into the values of the maximum degree of polarization @xmath178 measured on the 4 sources compared with our simulations .",
    "all measurements are excessively high with @xmath179 for pixels where the flux density @xmath24 is each time very low and all corresponding pixels are located on the edges of the clouds .",
    "in fact , these estimates of @xmath178 look like outliers in the polarization degree distribution which we believe can simply be explained by a high sensitivity of the values of @xmath136 in these particular domains of the maps due to the calibration of the intensity maps ; i.e. @xmath6 would be very sensitive to small offsets on @xmath24 on the edge of the maps .",
    "therefore , we have adopted another approach and checked how the value of @xmath180 compares with the statical maximum @xmath181 which one could expect for the distributions of @xmath6 of each sample with the assumption that the distribution of the stokes parameter is at first order gaussian in nature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we find values of @xmath182 equal to @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 for regions omc-2/3 , w49 , s106 and dr21 , respectively , i.e. values which are lower than 10 @xmath3 .",
    "these results do not justify our choice for @xmath162 , but show that this choice is not inconsistent with the distribution of the polarization degree detected in each region .",
    "in addition , the mean turbulent - to - uniform ratios obtained from the sf analyses for those regions all show that the uniform components of the magnetic fields should dominate over the turbulent ones within a factor of 2 to 3 , i.e. the magnetic field turbulent component is not expected to constrain @xmath21 to values close to 0 , in agreement with the results displayed in table [ table_regions ] .",
    "on the other hand , a closer look to the scupol catalog and to the results displayed in table 1 show that values of the mean polarization degree @xmath21 can be found as high as @xmath187 , as in the case for iram 04191 + 1522 and mon iras 12 .",
    "therefore , one could expect variations of the polarization efficiency from one region to the other . a look to the plots shown in figure [ plotssim ]",
    "show that variations of @xmath162 should only affect the variations of @xmath146 as a function of @xmath188 . for illustration purpose",
    ", we have added the curves shown with grey dashed - lines obtained for @xmath189 and for each region , except omc-2/3 , we still find common fitting solutions to @xmath1 from the intercepts of @xmath145 and @xmath146 with @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively .    in conclusion , if the physics employed in our simulations to describe the turbulent regimes of the cloud envelopes is correct , as suggested by the results displayed in table [ table_models_0p30 ] , then solutions to @xmath1 should be firstly constrained from the comparison of @xmath145 with @xmath150 . and , on a second round , it would be theoretically possible to constrain a range of solutions to @xmath162 by exploring where the intercepts of @xmath146 with @xmath151 obtain for different values of @xmath162 give values of @xmath1 still consistent with the solutions obtained from the comparison of @xmath145 with @xmath150 .",
    "@xcite show that under peculiar conditions depolarization could occur if grains embedded in dark clouds are aligned by radiative torques ( rats ) such that their long axis is perpendicular to the magnetic field . in their model ,",
    "the mean field is about 2 times stronger than the fluctuating magnetic field , a condition consistent with our results obtained from the analysis of the four regions compared with our simulations .",
    "the authors assume a uniform component of the magnetic field to be in the pos , i.e. @xmath190 .",
    "their results should be valid for clouds without embedded massive stars .",
    "an application of the definition proposed by @xcite ( see equation [ eq_rlaz ] ) has been investigated by pelkonen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of turbulent supersonic flows distinguishing sub - alfvnic from super - alfvnic cases .",
    "the inclusion of a proper radiative transfer calculation without detailed simulations of anisotropy shows that alignment efficiency decreases as the rats become less important into the denser regions . in their work",
    ", the question is raised how to distinguish the possible effect of the magnetic field topology from the interception of multiple sources .",
    "a possible complication for which likelihood should be avoided is by masking the high density regions as we did in our work .",
    "the maximum degree of polarization used by @xcite is fixed to 15@xmath3 .",
    "an extension of the @xcite model has been proposed by @xcite by including the effects of the mean interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) , as well as solutions of the radiative transfer equation to clumpy , optically thick ( @xmath191 ) prestellar cores and turbulent molecular clouds .",
    "their results are consistent with those described by @xcite and isothermality of large aligned grains is shown to be a reasonable hypothesis . with the rayleigh reduction factor @xmath167 defined from equation [ eq_rlaz ] , those authors find that the maximum polarization degree , as well as the power index of the @xmath192 relations are extremely sensitive to the adopted upper cutoff of the power - law distribution of dust grain size , but only moderately sensitive to simplifying assumptions about the radiative anisotropy and no maximum polarization degree is arbitrarily introduced . despite the highly complex topologies of the magnetic field ,",
    "those authors show that polarization maps should trace the mass - weighted projected magnetic field vectors reasonably well .",
    "their model explores a large area of parameter space , but does not study the variations of mhd regimes nor consider the impact of embedded sources .",
    "supplementary analysis on the subject is given by @xcite where an extension of their 2007 work is proposed . in their study",
    "they consider @xmath193 and a maximum polarization degree still fixed to 15@xmath3 .",
    "the effect of the distribution of the size of the grains is investigated further away and the effects of the anisotropy of the isrf are added to the analysis .",
    "they find that the inclusion of direction - dependent radiative torque efficiency weakens the dust grains alignment .",
    "this effect can be partially counterbalanced if the grain size is doubled in denser regions which means that magnetic fields could theoretically still be probed up to @xmath191 in regions without embedded sources and where the dynamical timescale of coagulation processes is short enough .",
    "the simulations discussed above can not be compared directly to ours mainly because they do not explore the same mhd regimes as we do , and also because they are more focused on cloud cores physical characterization rather than on cloud envelopes characterization , as we propose .",
    "for example , the turbulent regimes discussed by @xcite are supersonic and super - alfvnic while the one we find for the envelopes of s106 , omc-2/3 , w49 and dr21 are supersonic and sub - alfvnic .",
    "this might also explain the difference on the choice of values for @xmath162 .",
    "the synthetic polarization maps obtained from the mhd simulations give estimates of @xmath194 .",
    "these values are systematically different from the results obtained from the observed maps , where @xmath195 .",
    "we can therefore speculate what could be the cause of this difference .",
    "one of the main aspects that distinguish simulations and observations is the instrument sensitivity . while in numerical simulations we select the cells we want to use in the statistics , on the observational side the degrees of freedom are much smaller .",
    "low intensity regions of the mhd simulations could be over - represented compared to real data sets because observed los low column density can not be probed from the ground .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , at the lower end of intensity range the simulations reveal no correlation between intensity and polarization degree .",
    "the reason for this is that the turbulence in the low intensity regions is basically sub - alfvenic , i.e. magnetically dominated ( see burkhart et al .",
    "once we move the statistics to the high intensity regions , the denser regions become more turbulent dominated , resulting in strong depolarization . _",
    "the turbulent depolarization is a function of the intensity_.    from the observational point of view , the limited sensitivity of the instrument biases the statistics for the high intensity regions",
    ". it would be theoretically possible to remove low intensity pixels in the simulated maps and produce steeper slopes of the power - law used to fit the @xmath196 relation but how to choose this threshold limit would be too much arbitrary given the shortcomings of the models discussed in section [ shortcomings ] .",
    "another possible effect taking part is the alignment efficiency of the dust particles .",
    "the numerical simulations do not include radiative alignment for instance .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that , with the definition of the rayleigh reduction factor @xmath167 from equation [ eq_rlaz ] , the maximum polarization degree as well as the power - law index of the @xmath196 relation are extremely sensitive to the adopted cutoff of the power - law distribution of dust grain size and moderately sensitive to symplifying assumptions about the radiative anisotropy , as remarked before .",
    "at the same time , as mentionned before , their modelling do not explore the same range of turbulent regimes than we do which limits a direct comparison with our works .      every probability distribution function of the polarization degree @xmath6 , pdf(@xmath6 ) ,",
    "can theoretically be described as a function of the parameter @xmath197 from equation [ eq_phi ] with the following relation : @xmath198    for each regions , the estimate of @xmath21 , is expected to depend on the values of the rayleigh polarization reduction factor @xmath167 , of the turbulent polarization reduction factor @xmath165 , and on the average inclination of the uniform component of the magnetic field @xmath166 . within our modeling the parameter @xmath166",
    "is directly deduced from the initial conditions of the simulations .",
    "the effect of @xmath165 is directly included in our calculations via the integration of the stokes parameters along each los and estimates of @xmath31 should only depend on this parameter .",
    "in addition , the @xmath196 relation power - law index parameter @xmath26 should mainly depend on the values of the parameter @xmath167 .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the lack of correlation between parameters @xmath6 , @xmath31 and @xmath26 discussed in section [ parspace ] and shown in figures [ gamma_vs_b ] , [ gamma_vs_pmean ] and [ b_vs_stheta ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "if rats is the dominating mechanism producing dust grain alignment , the interdependence of parameters @xmath6 , @xmath31 and @xmath26 might be more complex and for example several cases could be imagined such the that parameter @xmath26 could depend on the values of @xmath197 and not @xmath167 only .",
    "such studies are obviously out of the framework of this work and would need further investigations .",
    "in this work we have presented an extensive analysis of the star - forming and molecular clouds 850 @xmath0 m polarization maps of the scupol catalog produced by @xcite .    for each of the 27 sufficiently sampled regions , sets of parameters @xmath21 , @xmath31 and @xmath26",
    "are systematically calculated in order to characterize the polarization properties , the depolarization properties and the turbulent - to - mean magnetic field ratio of each region as seen on the pos .",
    "as expected from theoretical modelling , the statistical analysis showed no specific correlation between these parameters .",
    "we also created synthetic 2d polarization maps from 3d mhd @xmath115 pixels grid simulations , performed for different mhd regimes , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "such mhd regimes are estimated for the s106 , omc-2/3 , w49 and dr21 molecular cloud regions with 3d mhd cubes properly scaled to the observed maps .",
    "the values obtained from the simulations for the alfvn and sonic mach numbers are in good agreement , within a factor of 2 , with the values obtained for those parameters from zeeman measurements as estimated by @xcite in the same regions .",
    "constraints on the values of the inclination angle @xmath1 of the mean magnetic field with respect to the los , are obtained by comparing the values of parameters @xmath21 and @xmath31 estimated from the simulated maps to those obtained from the observed maps of these four regions .",
    "last line of table [ table_summary ] gives a summary of the range of estimates obtained for @xmath1 from our data ( 1st line ) , and the constraints provided by @xcite ( 2nd line ) and the range given by the combination of zeeman measurements and the cf method ( lines 3 and 4 of the table ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that most of the results obtained from our analysis of simple ideal isothermal and non - selfgraviting 3d mhd simulations , once properly scaled to the observations , are consistent with results obtained from the latter .",
