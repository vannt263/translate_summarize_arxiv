    "recently we have presented an algorithm  @xcite for the approximation of the ground state of translationally invariant ( ti ) spin chains with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) my means of ti mps . in this work",
    "we will use the ground states obtained in  @xcite as the basis of an ansatz for excited states with definite momentum .",
    "we will consider only spin chain hamiltonians that are translationally invariant thereby fulfilling @xmath1=0 $ ] where @xmath2 is the translation operator that shifts the lattice by one site .",
    "furthermore , as we will deal with finite chains in the following , it means that there is no well defined momentum operator for our systems .",
    "nevertheless we can classify translationally invariant states by their quasi - momentum which is defined in terms of the their eigenvalue with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "this definition is sensible since in the thermodynamic limit , if we keep the chain length fixed , the lattice spacing becomes infinitesimally small and the quasi - momentum becomes identical to the momentum , which is then well defined . for convenience , we will use the term _ momentum _ when we actually refer to the quasi - momentum .",
    "this should not cause any confusion since we will only deal with quasi - momenta throughout this work .    since @xmath3 and @xmath2 commute",
    ", they can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "this suggests that any variational ansatz based on eigenstates of the translation operator will be well suited to define families of states within which minimization with respect to some variational parameters will yield _ momentum _ eigenstates with minimal energy .",
    "formulating this observation in terms of an mps - based ansatz has led in the past to some very interesting results about excitation spectra .",
    "the first approach in this direction has been made in @xcite where the main result is the celebrated insight that the fixed point of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) can be written as an mps .",
    "in addition to this , based on the mps that is obtained for the ground state of the infinite heisenberg spin-@xmath4 chain , the authors suggest a variational ansatz for excitations with definite _",
    "momentum_. since the translationally invariant mps they start with is an approximation of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit , their ansatz for excitations is only well suited in the limit @xmath5 . for finite chains ,",
    "the idea of using _ momentum _",
    "eigenstates for the diagonalization of ti hamlitonians has been used in  @xcite in order to obtain a few of the lowest branches of excitations for the bilinear - biquadratic ( bb ) spin-1 chain .",
    "the resulting state is a ti superposition of a special class of tensor network states , which can be viewed as an extension of mps with pbc  @xcite to states that can accommodate multipartite entanglement .",
    "even though the multipartite entanglement is a nice feature which yields a better variational ansatz in the cases when the approximated states have that special entanglement structure ( in  @xcite one has in addition to the usual maximally entangled virtual bonds between nearest neighbors a virtual ghz state connecting all sites ) we will not adopt it in our present ansatz .",
    "furthermore we would like to point out that the individual mps tensors produced by the minimization procedure in  @xcite are not ti , only their superposition is .",
    "recent results  @xcite on the approximation of ground states of ti pbc hamiltonians opened up the possibility of unifying the ideas from  @xcite and  @xcite in order to obtain an algorithm for excitations with definite _ momentum _ in which only one local tensor has to be determined , thereby avoiding the usual sweeping procedure and the associated factor @xmath6 in the computational cost .",
    "one of the main features of ti mps is the fact that the tensor network that has to be contracted for the computation of expectation values contains big powers of a so - called transfer matrix  @xcite . for non - critical systems",
    "the eigenvalues of this transfer matrix usually decay rapidly enough s.t .",
    "big powers thereof can be accurately approximated by considering only a few dominant eigenvectors . in these cases",
    "the computational cost for the evaluation of expectation values for systems with pbc can be reduced significantly from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the virtual bond dimension of the mps . for critical systems",
    "however the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix decay much slower and the algorithm that must be employed in order to obtain the optimal approximation within the class of mps with fixed @xmath9 has a scaling that depends in a not yet fully understood way  @xcite on @xmath9 , @xmath6 and on the universality class of the simulated model .",
    "the ansatz we present in this work is based on ti - mps and thereby all computed quantities will contain big powers of the transfer matrix . we would like to emphasize that the computational cost can be reduced by a factor of @xmath10 only in the case of non - critical systems . for critical systems",
    "the full contraction of tensor networks ( i.e. without using any approximations of the transfer matrix ) will turn out to have a more favorable overall scaling of the computational cost .",
    "details on why this is the case and on the scaling of the computational cost can be found in the next section .",
    "due to @xmath11 , the translation operator @xmath2 that shifts a state on a pbc lattice with @xmath6 sites by @xmath4 site is the generator of the cyclic group of order @xmath6 .",
    "hence its eigenvalues @xmath12 must be roots of the unity i.e. @xmath13 with integer @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "an ansatz for eigenstates of @xmath2 with eigenvalue @xmath15 is obviously given by    @xmath16    henceforth we will refer to states of the form ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) as bloch states .",
    "note that we have used the convention that @xmath2 is the operator that realizes a translation by one site to the right s.t .",
    "the state @xmath18 can in principle be any arbitrary state , but in order to exploit the advantages of ti mps , we choose    @xmath19    with identical matrices @xmath20 on all sites except the first one .",
    "we will choose the @xmath20 to be the matrices corresponding to the best ti mps ground state approximation for a given model .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath20 remain fixed throughout the entire simulation .",
    "this is the reason why we have omitted them from our labeling convention for the bloch states @xmath21 .",
    "we have used bold letters in order to denote objects that are obtained if one rearranges the components of three indexed mps tensors into vectors , i.e. @xmath22 . after fixing the _ momentum _",
    "@xmath23 , the bloch states @xmath21 will depend only on the tensors @xmath24 which will define the variational manifold .",
    "our ansatz for bloch eigenstates differs slightly from the ones presented in refs .",
    "@xcite although it is conceptually very similar .",
    "an important feature of all these approaches is the reduction of the dimension of the problem by a factor @xmath6 .",
    "this is reached by effectively projecting the original problem into the subspace with fixed _ momentum _ @xmath23 and minimizing the energy within the variational manifold spanned by the free parameters in the ansatz . in our case",
    "these free parameters are the components @xmath24 of an mps tensor . as it is always the case with mps algorithms , one must eliminate the ambiguities arising from the mps representation by fixing the gauge . here",
    "this is done by starting with certain tensors @xmath25 in ( [ eq : ansatz_phi ] ) and not changing them throughout the entire minimization procedure .",
    "this automatically fixes the gauge of the tensors @xmath24 as they are surrounded on both sides by @xmath25 .",
    "ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) defines a class of variational states for the lowest energy states with fixed _",
    "momentum_. the energy is a quadratic expression in the tensor @xmath24 and thereby , as it is usually the case in mps based algorithms , minimizing    @xmath26    is equivalent to solving a generalized eigenvalue equation    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is defined by    @xmath29    and @xmath30 by    @xmath31    the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath32 yields then the tensor @xmath33 that when plugged into our ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) gives the _ momentum_-@xmath23 state with minimal energy .",
    "note that the variational principle guarantees that only the bloch state ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) with lowest energy is the best approximation to the exact eigenstate with that _ momentum _ within the subspace spanned by our ansatz states .",
    "however if the lowest energy state is approximated accurately , due to the fact that the other @xmath34 are orthogonal to @xmath33 , the next solution @xmath35 has a good chance to be close to the next higher energy state with that momentum .",
    "in fact it will turn out that quite a few of the higher energy solutions of ( [ eq : generalized_eigenvalue_problem ] ) are good approximations to low energy states with fixed _ momentum_.",
    "their precision is most of the time surprisingly good given the fact that the variational principle does not hold for these states .",
    "the quality of these solutions depends strongly on the bond dimension @xmath9 , the chain length @xmath6 and the model under consideration .     as the norm of a ti mps determined by the tensor @xmath25 . ]",
    "the bottleneck of our method is the computation of the effective matrices @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath30 since it is the slightly simpler one .",
    "it reads    @xmath36 \\b \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath37 is a tensor network resembling the norm of a ti mps with empty slots @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( see figure  [ fig : n_0 m ] ) . to get from the second to the third line we have used the fact that due to the pbc only the relative distance between @xmath40 and @xmath39 plays a role . in the last line",
    "we have merely renamed the summation index and introduced the quantity @xmath37 .",
    "thus in order to obtain @xmath30 we have to compute the contraction of the @xmath6 tensor networks @xmath37 and then take the sum of these terms after weighting each one of them with the corresponding phase factor . the computational cost for the contraction of each tensor network is @xmath41 s.t .",
    "the overall cost for computing @xmath30 is @xmath42 .     as the expectation value of a two - site operator with respect to a ti mps determined by the tensor @xmath25 . ]",
    "@xmath28 is constructed very much in the same spirit .",
    "first , due to the translational invariance of the hamiltonian we can write    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the term acting between the first two sites of the chain . note that in  ( [ eq : h_ti ] ) we have restricted ourselves to nearest neighbor hamiltonians since this is the type of models we will treat numerically in this work",
    ". generalizing the ideas developed here to any local hamiltonian is straightforward . with  ( [ eq : h_ti ] )",
    ", @xmath28 reads    @xmath45    again , due to the fact that the @xmath46 and @xmath47 sums run over all @xmath6 sites of a pbc chain , it is irrelevant where they begin s.t .",
    "the @xmath48 sum merely yields a factor @xmath6 .",
    "we rename the summation indices for convenience and obtain    @xmath49 \\b \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 is a tensor network resembling the expectation value of an operator acting on the sites @xmath40 and @xmath51 with respect to a ti mps where the slots @xmath38 and @xmath39 have been left open ( see figure  [ fig : h_0 nm ] ) .",
    "the computational cost for the contraction of each tensor network is again @xmath41 but now we have a total of @xmath52 summands s.t .",
    "the overall cost for computing @xmath28 is @xmath53 .",
    "note that to obtain @xmath28 is computationally the most expensive part of our algorithm so we can say that the overall computational cost scales like @xmath53 .          at first sight the cost seems horrible for a 1d - algorithm .",
    "let us however have a closer look at what we get for this price .",
    "first of all note that if we compute the sets of matrices @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 $ ] and store these , we can obtain the @xmath28 and @xmath30 for all @xmath23 trivially by just building the appropriately weighted sums .",
    "for each of these @xmath23 we then have to solve the generalized eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : generalized_eigenvalue_problem ] ) . since @xmath28 and @xmath30 are small @xmath57 matrices solving  ( [ eq : generalized_eigenvalue_problem ] )",
    "does not represent any difficulty and can be done using any standard library eigenvalue solver .",
    "each eigenvalue problem leads to @xmath58 orthonormal vectors @xmath34 which plugged into the ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) yield @xmath58 states . thus computing the sets @xmath54 and @xmath55 only once supplies immediately us with @xmath59 states ! by comparing our numerical results to exactly solvable models we will show that the low energy states obtained in this way are very accurate .",
    "this means that in terms of computational time per state our algorithm performs quite well .",
    "the computational bottleneck at the moment is that we have to store @xmath52 @xmath57 matrices in the memory . with the present implementation , for a chain with @xmath60 sites",
    ", we can go up to @xmath61 . for larger @xmath6 simulations we have to settle for smaller @xmath9 .",
    "it is however straightforward how this boundary can be pushed considerably towards larger @xmath9 .",
    "first , instead of keeping all matrices in the memory , one can write them to the hard disk after computing each of them .",
    "second , since the @xmath54 and @xmath55 are independent , one can parallelize their computation .",
    "thus the conceptual bottleneck becomes the contraction of the tensor networks @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "for non - critical systems big powers of the transfer matrix can be well approximated by a few of its dominant eigenvectors  @xcite and the contraction of _ most _ of the @xmath54 can be done with the computational cost @xmath62 while that of _ most _ of the @xmath55 with the cost @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath40 represents the dimension of the subspace within which we approximate the powers of the transfer matrix  @xcite .",
    "this can not be done however for critical systems where in principle @xmath40 may grow as big as @xmath10 thereby yielding a much worse scaling than the naive @xmath41 . note that since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are _ open _ tensor networks the @xmath7 contraction scheme  @xcite that works for expectation values ( i.e. _ closed _ tensor networks ) can not be applied here .",
    "additionally , even if we restrict ourselves to non - critical systems , not _ all _ of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be computed with the cost that scales like @xmath64 : if the distance between the _ open _ slots is not big enough , we can not use the approximation for big powers of the transfer matrix between the slots , and we are back to exact contraction for this portion of the chain which in the case of @xmath54 leads to the overall scaling @xmath65 and in the case of @xmath55 to the scaling @xmath66 .",
    "thus the very naive exact contraction procedure that we use is not so bad after all in this case even if it scales like @xmath41 .",
    "there is one more subtlety we would like to point out here .",
    "it turns out that the matrix @xmath30 is always singular which presents a problem when we try to solve the generalized eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : generalized_eigenvalue_problem ] ) since the solution involves the inverse @xmath67 .",
    "we can circumvent this problem by solving  ( [ eq : generalized_eigenvalue_problem ] ) within the nonsingular subspace like it has been done in  @xcite .",
    "eigenvectors associated to the zero eigenspace of @xmath30 will result in physical states @xmath68 , i.e. these are states of zero length in the hilbert space .",
    "any physical operator will produce a zero when acting on these states .",
    "in particular , the effective hamiltonian @xmath28 will also have zero eigenvalues for the same eigenvectors , and we do not loose any information by restricting to the nonsingular subspace .",
    "the dimension of the zero eigenspace can be shown to be @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 as we demonstrate in @xcite .",
    "the tricky point is that for some models the strictly non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath30 become so small that they yield the generalized eigenvalue problem ill conditioned . in general",
    "this behavior does not occur for small @xmath9 . for big @xmath9 or",
    "in certain regions of the phase diagram however the nonsingular eigenvalues become so small that it is hard to distinguish numerically between the singular subspace and the nonsingular one .",
    "this issue might be the source of the mysterious negative gap that appears in  @xcite in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "we have employed a slightly different method for the regularization of @xmath30 . instead of projecting the problem into the strictly non - singular subspace ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the subspace in which the eigenvalues of @xmath30 are larger than some @xmath73 .",
    "there is a tradeoff between loss in precision due to this projection and loss in precision due to the bad conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem . in the end",
    "we have settled for a seemingly optimal @xmath74 .",
    "we have applied the algorithm presented above to two exactly solvable nearest neighbour interaction spin models in order to benchmark its accuracy : the quantum ising model and the heisenberg spin-@xmath0 antiferromagnetic chain .",
    "even though the heisenberg model is exactly solvable by means of bethe ansatz , in practice it is much harder to obtain its entire low - energy spectrum .",
    "this is due to the fact that the elementary excitations are two - spinon states and among these , the solution of the bethe ansatz equations for the two - spinon singlet states are computationally very challenging  @xcite .",
    "thus for long chains we have restricted ourselves to check only the precision of the lowest two - spinon triplets . for small chains that are accessible via exact diagonalization on the other hand ,",
    "we compare not only the entire low - energy spectrum but also the fidelity of the states themselves .            ) . ]",
    "the hamiltonian we have used in our simulations of the quantum ising model is given by    @xmath75    we have used this version rather than    @xmath76    due to the fact that having a diagonal interaction term is more convenient for the numerics .",
    "of course both versions are equivalent since they can be transformed into each other by means of the unitary transformation @xmath77 where the @xmath78 are 1-qubit hadamard gates . for the exact diagonalization",
    "however we have used ( [ eq : h_is_exact ] ) in order to stick closer to the procedure given in @xcite where the authors treat the spin-@xmath0 xy chain .",
    "the diagonalization of ( [ eq : h_is_exact ] ) for pbc in the limit of an infinite number of sites is straightforward  @xcite .",
    "the first thing one has to do is to map the spin hamiltonian to a fermionic one via a jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "now the jordan - wigner transformation is non - local due to the fact that it transforms local spin operators into fermionic ones that anticommute if they act on different sites .",
    "luckily for almost all terms in the hamiltonian the non - localities cancel except for the term representing the interaction between the last and the first site .",
    "this term ends up containing a global parity operator acting on all sites and thus breaking the translational invariance with respect to the fermionic modes .",
    "now , if we are interested in the thermodynamic limit , we will eventually take the limes @xmath5 at some point , and in this limit the contribution of one interaction term to the energy can be neglected .",
    "we thus have the freedom to alter this term as we please in order to simplify things .",
    "one very convenient choice are the so - called jordan - wigner boundary conditions which are nothing more than simply neglecting the global parity operator in the last term thereby yielding the fermionic hamiltonian translationally invariant .",
    "note that the jordan - wigner boundary conditions can not be expressed in a trivial way in terms of spin operators .",
    "the fermionic hamiltonian obtained in this way is quadratic and translationally invariant , but it is not particle conserving .",
    "this can be fixed by a canonical transformation @xcite to non - interacting bogoliubov fermions .",
    "the ground state of the system is then given by the new fermionic vacuum while excited states can be obtained by sequentially filling the fermionic modes .",
    "ordering the eigenstates of the original spin model by momentum and energy , it turns out that the lowest energy branch coincides with the dispersion relation of the bogoliubov fermions .",
    "this happens because for a given momentum , the lowest energy state is always a state where precisely one fermionic mode is occupied .",
    "now , for finite systems with periodic boundary conditions , the hamiltonian after the jordan - wigner transformation presents a difficulty : due to the fact that in this case we can not choose the boundary conditions freely , there is one term that contains a global parity operator as prefactor ( see eq . 2.11 in @xcite ) . at first sight , this term makes the bogoliubov transformation impossible .",
    "however , if we project the hamiltonian onto the subspaces with either odd or even parity , we can replace the parity operator by its eigenvalue in that subspace s.t .",
    "it becomes @xmath79 , and we can apply the bogoliubov transformation in each subspace separately . the spectrum of the original hamiltonian can then be constructed by picking from each subspace the states with the correct parity .",
    "it turns out that we can arbitrarily choose the sign of the bogoliubov parity by shifting the fermi surface .",
    "for example , if we choose the fermionic vacuum to be the state with lowest energy , all excited states are particle excitations and it turns out that the parity operator changes its sign under the bogoliubov transformation for fields below the critical point i.e. @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath81 this choice of the vacuum state leaves the parity operator invariant .",
    "thus for @xmath82 , in principle we can switch the sign of the parity operator by shifting the fermi surface and thereby we could always define the bogoliubov modes such that the parity operator remains invariant .",
    "we will however give numerical evidence for the fact that choosing the fermi surface to be the fermionic vacuum state is the physical choice .",
    "let us first present the results obtained at the critical point @xmath83 . in figure",
    "[ fig : is_ei_g10_n50 ] we have plotted the energy of the lowest ten branches of excitations of a chain with @xmath84 spins obtained for mps bond dimensions @xmath85 and @xmath61 .",
    "the results for @xmath61 are so close to the exact spectrum that it makes much more sense to look at plots of the relative energy precision rather than at plots of the energy itself .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n50 ] .        at first sight",
    "the crossing of the precision line for the first branch of excitations with the one for the second branch seems a little unusual .",
    "how can it be that states with higher energy are approximated by roughly two orders of magnitude better than states with lower energy ?",
    "the answer to this question is obvious if one looks at how the eigenstates emerge from the elementary bogoliubov modes .",
    "table  [ tab : is_g10_n50_spectrum_from_elem_exc ] shows which bogoliubov modes contribute to each individual eigenstate in the first four branches of excitations .",
    "modes from the even parity subspace have half - integer momentum while the ones from the odd parity subspace have integer momentum .",
    "note that since only excitations with an even number of particles are allowed in the even - parity subspace , the resulting states always have integer momentum .",
    "henceforth @xmath86 shall denote the vacuum in the even parity subspace and @xmath87 the vacuum in the odd parity one .",
    "the ground state of the critical chain is the bogoliubov vacuum in the even parity subspace i.e. @xmath88 .",
    "the first excited state is the zero momentum state from the first branch and is given by a bogoliubov mode with zero momentum from the odd parity subspace .",
    "the zero momentum mode has energy zero so the states @xmath87 and @xmath89 have exactly the same energy .",
    "however this happens only at the critical point @xmath83 . in general @xmath87 and",
    "@xmath89 have different energy . ]",
    "it is sufficient to show in table  [ tab : is_g10_n50_spectrum_from_elem_exc ] how the spectrum emerges from elementary excitations for momenta @xmath90 since the dispersion relation of the bogoliubov fermions is symmetric around @xmath72 as can be seen in figure  [ fig : is_lambdak_g10_n50_exact ] .",
    "the important thing to notice in table  [ tab : is_g10_n50_spectrum_from_elem_exc ] is that the lowest branch of excitations does not contain solely one - particle excitations as it does in the case of the infinite chain .",
    "looking back at the right plot in figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n50 ] we see immediately that the one - particle excitations from the first two branches are approximated with roughly the same accuracy between @xmath91 and @xmath92 with the lower value for small momentum states .",
    "one can easily check that the states with the same order of accuracy from higher branches are precisely one - particle excitations . on the other hand",
    "it is obvious that two - particle excitations from any branch where one of the particles has fixed momentum @xmath93 can be found in the plateau with relative precision of roughly @xmath94 .",
    "the other plateaus of similar precision in the @xmath61 plot of figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n50 ] represent either two - particle states where each particle has higher momentum or three and more particle excitations .",
    "this interpretation of the branch crossings in figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n50 ] is strong evidence for the fact that ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) is a very good ansatz for one - particle excitations .",
    "however it turns out that if @xmath9 is large enough , ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) is also a fairly good ansatz for many - particle excitations .",
    "the reason for this is that the large bond dimension compensates for the localization of excitations inherent in ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) by spreading the effect of the optimized tensor @xmath24 to a region around it whose size is of the order of the induced correlation length of the mps we start with .",
    "this is exactly why for the ising chain with @xmath83 , @xmath95 and @xmath61 even states from tenth branch are approximated with an accuracy of roughly @xmath96 .",
    "now let us have a closer look at the region of the `` level - crossing '' between the lowest two - fermion branch from the even parity subspace and the lowest one - fermion branch from the odd parity subspace . in the case of @xmath83",
    "this crossing turns out to be at approximately @xmath97 . in the immediate neighborhood of the",
    "crossing the energy difference between states with identical momentum becomes very small .",
    "now if the bond dimension @xmath9 is chosen such that the precision of the mps is of the same order like the interlevel spacing , these two levels can not be discriminated properly by the mps algorithm and thus there is no clear interpretation we can give to these mps states in terms of one or two - particle states . as can be seen in the @xmath85 plot of figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n50 ] , in this region the first and second mps branch interpolate between the one and the two - particle states which we can safely discriminate .",
    "note that this observation holds only on the side of the level crossing where the one - particle state has higher energy than the two - particle state ( e.g. at @xmath98 on the left side of the crossing ) . on the other side , the one - particle excitation has lower energy and our one - particle mps ansatz is perfectly suited to discriminate between the first and the second branch even if the precision is smaller than the actual gap between the levels .",
    "the last thing we would like point out about figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n50 ] is the gap in accuracy between the states from the second and third branch at momentum @xmath99 .",
    "it turns out that this is a doubly degenerate state since it can be created by two different superpositions of elementary excitations with the same energy namely @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this is the reason why the precision of the @xmath99 state in the second branch is better than that of the surrounding two - particle states which are not degenerated : variational algorithms are more precise if they try to approximate the energy of an entire subspace of the hilbert space rather than that of a single state .",
    "however since all states generated by our algorithm are orthogonal , the price we have to pay for the improved precision in the second branch , is a slightly worse precision of the @xmath99 state in the third branch .    with this said",
    ", we can present the results we have obtained for different chain lengths @xmath6 and different values of the magnetic field @xmath102 .",
    "figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n100_n500 ] shows the accuracy of the algorithm for chains with @xmath103 and @xmath104 sites at @xmath83 .",
    "the plot for @xmath60 is very similar to the @xmath61 plot from figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n50 ] . at small momenta @xmath105",
    "the one - particle excitations lie in the branches @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "these states are not reliably reproduced by our algorithm within the precision that is otherwise reached for one - particle excitations .",
    "presumably this would be fixed by increasing the bond dimension @xmath9 beyond @xmath108 .",
    "however at the moment we can not go to larger @xmath9 for @xmath60 . for @xmath109",
    "the maximally accessible bond dimension is @xmath110 .",
    "the corresponding plot from figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g10_n100_n500 ] is very similar to the small @xmath9 plot for @xmath95 . again in the region of the `` level - crossing '' between one - particle and two - particle excitations around @xmath111 our algorithm has difficulties obtaining the maximally reachable precision for the one - particle states .",
    "now let us look at how the algorithm performs when we move away from the critical point .",
    "figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g11_n50_n100 ] shows the relative energy difference of the mps approximation for @xmath112 i.e. above the critical point .",
    "the most striking feature in this regime is clear separation of the lowest branch of excitations from the higher ones .",
    "this happens due to the fact that in this case the lowest branch contains only one - particle states as can be seen in table  [ tab : is_g11_n50_spectrum_from_elem_exc ] .",
    "again if @xmath9 is large enough ( e.g. @xmath61 for @xmath95 ) , the different plateaus of similar precision become clearly visible .",
    "the first one at roughly @xmath113 contains two - particle excitations from the second and third branch where one of the fermionic modes has momentum @xmath93 .",
    "the second one with precision around @xmath114 consists of states where one of the fermionic modes has momentum @xmath115 .",
    "note that in the plot for @xmath60 the lowest branch has slightly better precision than the one in the @xmath95 plot even though the virtual bond dimension is the same .",
    "this happens presumably because in this case the chain is long enough such that the running particle can not `` feel its own tail '' due to the pbc .",
    "this is another piece of evidence that ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) is very well suited to describe one - particle excitations .",
    "whether many - particle excitations are faithfully reproduced depends strongly on the magnitude of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath82 the picture changes dramatically .",
    "we can see in figure  [ fig : is_reldiffei_g9_n50_n100 ] that at @xmath116 the best precision for states from the lowest branch is five to seven orders of magnitude worse than for @xmath112 . without any knowledge of the quasi - particle structure of the spectrum",
    "this huge difference might look a bit surprising .",
    "even more surprising is the fact that the best precision at @xmath116 is one order of magnitude worse than at the critical point @xmath83 .",
    "however looking at the quasi - particle structure in table  [ tab : is_g9_n50_spectrum_from_elem_exc ] clarifies the situation .",
    "as already mentioned above the parity of the bogoliubov fermions in the odd - parity subspace can in principle be arbitrarily chosen by shifting the fermi surface . throughout this work",
    "have made the most natural choice of choosing all modes to have positive energy i.e. none of the quasi - particle excitations are hole modes . for @xmath82",
    "this choice switches the sign of bogoliubov parity operator such that we must pick states with an even number of excitations from the odd - parity subspace .",
    "one might argue against this convention and claim that it would be much more natural to pick the fermi surface s.t .",
    "the zero - momentum mode is a hole excitation which yields the bogoliubov parity operator identical to the spin parity operator . in this case",
    "we would have to construct all states from this subspace using an odd number of quasi - particles . on the other hand table  [ tab : is_g9_n50_spectrum_from_elem_exc ]",
    "clearly shows that our one - particle excitation ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) is a poor approximation to all states in this regime thereby indicating that indeed for @xmath82 there exist no one - particle excitations .",
    "thus our choice of the fermi surface is justified and we have to construct the spectrum by picking the even quasi - particle excitations from the odd - parity subspace",
    ".    we can understand this behavior from another point of view if we consider an infinite chain with open boundary conditions .",
    "it is well known that in the region of the phase diagram where the ground state is doubly degenerated , the elementary excitations are kink excitations .",
    "if we would however impose periodic boundary conditions on the infinite chain , the single kink states would not be eigenstates any more since the existence of one domain wall would automatically imply the existence of a second one . in finite systems with pbc ,",
    "the situation is a bit more complicated since the ground state degeneracy is not exact ( the energy difference decays exponentially with @xmath6 ) , but we can still argue along similar lines that localized perturbations , that interpolate between the states of the almost degenerated ground state manifold , must always come in pairs .",
    "the other model we have studied is the antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain .",
    "the hamiltonian reads    @xmath117    where @xmath118 and @xmath119 denote as usually the pauli operators .",
    "as we already mentioned , the tensors @xmath25 that constitute the backbone of ansatz ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) are the results of the simulations presented in  @xcite . in that work we have obtained a ti mps approximation of ground states for finite spin chains with pbc using matrices @xmath20 that were real and symmetric .",
    "these results themselves were based on previous work  @xcite where we have approximated the ground state of infinite obc chains by ti mps with real symmetric matrices .",
    "thus the starting point in the entire procedure that leads ultimately to the excited states presented here is the imaginary time evolution for an infinite chain with a set of real symmetric matrix product operators ( mpo ) . as we explained in  @xcite",
    "it is not possible to construct these directly from the the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_hb ] ) .",
    "however , by means of the unitary transformation @xmath120 ( i.e. acting with a @xmath121-gate on every second site ) we obtain    @xmath122    which allows us to express the imaginary time evolution in terms of real symmetric mpo . note that in order for this procedure to work we have to restrict ourselves to chains with an even number of sites . in this case",
    "it does not matter if we apply the @xmath121-gates on sites with an odd or an even index , so without loss of generality we will apply them on the odd ones .",
    "now @xmath123 and @xmath124 have the same spectrum and since their eigenstates are simply related to eachother by @xmath125 we can digonalize @xmath124 first and obtain the eigenstates of @xmath123 subsequently with very little effort",
    ".            we will show below that the momentum of a state is not always invariant under the transformation ( [ eq : h_hb_transf ] ) .",
    "the easiest way to obtain the momentum for any given state is by computing the expectation value of the translation operator @xmath2 with respect to that state .",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath124 are both translationally invariant thus all their eigenstates have well defined momentum so we can be sure that the reverse transformation @xmath126 will map momentum eigenstates to momentum eigenstates albeit @xmath23 will generally differ from @xmath127 .",
    "the relation between the momenta follows easily from    @xmath128    where we have used @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "thus the change in momentum depends solely on the expectation value of the operator @xmath131 which in the following we will call the _ parity _ operator .",
    "this naming convention makes sense since @xmath132 where @xmath133 thus @xmath134 measures the parity of the total spin along the @xmath135-direction .",
    "note that due to the factor @xmath136 the meaning of positive and negative parity is interchanged for chains with @xmath137 and chains with @xmath138 .",
    "the parity is a good quantum number for both @xmath123 and @xmath139 so there exist eigenstates @xmath140 that have well defined parity plus or minus one . if @xmath141 the momentum remains unchanged i.e. @xmath142 , if @xmath143 we have @xmath144 where @xmath145 denotes addition modulo @xmath6 .",
    "note that the parity itself is invariant under the mapping between @xmath123 and @xmath139 since @xmath146 .",
    "now the generators of the @xmath147 symmetry for @xmath139 do not commute with the translation operator thus we can not classify the momentum eigenstates in terms of irreducible representations of @xmath147 .",
    "for @xmath123 however we can do this , so we know exactly the degeneracy structure of the spectrum in each subspace with fixed momentum . thus if we encounter for instance a threefold degenerated eigenstate of @xmath139 , we know this is mapped to a spin triplet with well defined momentum in the original hamiltonian .",
    "accordingly it must contain a two - dimensional subspace with negative parity corresponding to total spin along the @xmath135-direction @xmath79 and a one - dimensional subspace corresponding to total spin @xmath38 . since the spin triplet in the original hamiltonian",
    "has well defined momentum , according to the rules for the mapping @xmath148 , we will have one eigenstate of @xmath139 with momentum @xmath23 and a two - dimensional subspace with the same energy but different momentum @xmath149 . in this way , and thus there would be no momentum shift in this case .",
    "a quintuplet would contain a three - dimensional subspace with parity @xmath150 and a two - dimensional subspace with parity @xmath151 .",
    "thus in this case we would observe three states with no momentum shift and two states with a @xmath152-shift .",
    "the generalization to higher multiplets is obvious .",
    "] after approximating the spectrum of @xmath139 and labeling all energies with the corresponding momentum we can obtain the spectrum of @xmath123 by mere inspection of the degeneracy structure .",
    "table  [ tab : hb_n16_spectrum_multiplets_parity ] and table  [ tab : hbtransf_n16_spectrum_multiplets_parity ] illustrate how the multiplets of @xmath123 and @xmath139 are related to eachother .",
    "this procedure works very well for the lower branches of the dispersion relation where the precision of our simulation is good enough to discriminate unambigously between different multiplets . for higher branches , on one hand the precision gets worse and on the other hand the density of states increases such that multiplets with similar energy become effectively undistiguishable for our algorithm . in this case the eigenstates with well defined momentum that we obtain for the hamiltonian @xmath139 do not have well defined parity i.e. they mix parity eigenstates with different parity .",
    "since states with same momentum and different parity are mapped by ( [ eq : eigenstate_transf ] ) to states with different momentum , if we start with such a momentum eigenstate we obtain after the transformation a superposition of states with different momenta which is clearly not a momentum eigenstate .",
    "there are however two ways to overcome this issue and obtain approximations of the eigenstates of @xmath123 that are at the same time exact momentum eigenstates .",
    "the _ first _ one amounts to computing the matrix elements of the translation operator @xmath2 in the subspace spanned by the transformed states @xmath153 where @xmath154 and then diagonalize this matrix .",
    "it is not difficult to check that this can be done for each momentum @xmath127 separately since @xmath155 which is a translationally invariant operator and thus it does not mix states with different momentum . diagonalizing each of the @xmath156 yields for each @xmath127 a unitary @xmath157 that is nothing more than the transformation that we need to obtain the desired momentum eigenstates via @xmath158 .",
    "the new momentum @xmath159 can be read off the diagonal matrix @xmath160 .",
    "there are two drawbacks that come with this procedure .",
    "the first one is that we must compute the matrix elements @xmath161 each of which is done with the computational cost @xmath162 . since there are @xmath163 of these where @xmath164 is the number of branches , we obtain the overall cost @xmath165 .",
    "usually we compute enough branches such that @xmath166 holds , thus the cost for this procedure ends up being higher than the one for the diagonalization of @xmath139 .",
    "the second drawback is that the superpositions @xmath167 mix the original approximations of the energy levels thereby slightly lowering the energy of higher excitations but increasing the energy of lower excitations , which are usually the ones we are most interested in .    the _ second _ way to approximate the eigenstates of the original hamiltonian @xmath123 such that they are at the same time exact momentum eigenstates is to add to @xmath139 a perturbation that splits degenerated levels with different parity .",
    "this is easily achieved by taking @xmath168 where @xmath169 must be chosen such that it is big enough for our algorithm to deliver only states with a single parity , but as small as possible in order to avoid numerical inaccuracies caused by altering the hamiltonian . in the case of the heisenberg model ,",
    "if we choose to compute @xmath170 branches , @xmath171 fulfills these requirements . in practice",
    "we first apply our algorithm to @xmath172 which yields for each momentum @xmath127 @xmath164 states with positive parity .",
    "these states do not change their momentum under the transformation ( [ eq : eigenstate_transf ] ) .",
    "subsequently we apply the algorithm to @xmath173 which yields states with negative parity that change their momentum after the transformation according to @xmath144 . in this way we end up with @xmath174 branches of states that approximate the spectrum of @xmath123 and",
    "that are at the same time exact momentum eigenstates .",
    "the computational cost per state is thus exactly the same like diagonalizing only @xmath139 .",
    "let us first look at the results we have obtained for a small chain with @xmath175 sites .",
    "we have chosen to look at such a small system first for two reasons : _ first _ , even though the heisenberg model is exactly solvable via bethe ansatz , obtaining _ all _ energy levels can be quite involved . choosing @xmath6 as small as @xmath175 allows us to compute the spectrum of this small chain by means of exact diagonalization . _",
    "second _ , even for the energy levels that are easily computable with the bethe ansatz ( i.e. , the triplet states in the subspace of two - spinon excitations  @xcite ) it is not possible to obtain the eigenstates themselves .",
    "exact diagonalization of a small chain on the other hand allows us to compute and store the exact eigenstates in order to check the fidelity of our mps approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig : hb_ei_reldiffei_n16 ] shows the energy of the first ten branches of excitations and the corresponding relative precision .",
    "note how states belonging to the same multiplet have very similar precision even though they have different parity and thus correspond to eigenstates of @xmath139 with different momentum .",
    "since there are no one - particle excitations in the low - energy spectrum of the af heisenberg model , we do not obtain such a good precision like in the case of the quantum ising model .",
    "nevertheless we get a very good approximation of the first excited level , namely the triplet excitation at @xmath99 .",
    "we have also tested the accuracy of the states themselves : for non - degenerated states , the absolute value of the overlap is a perfect measure for this , and for reasons that will become clear immediately , we have looked at the sine of the fidelity . for degenerated states , in order to compare the subspace spanned by our mps to the one spanned by the exact eigenstates , we have used as a measure for the distance the definition given in chapter 7 of  @xcite : the sine of the largest canonical angle between the two subspaces .",
    "the canonical angles can be easily computed from the matrix that has as its entries the overlaps between all states of the subspaces that we want to compare .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig : hb_n16_canonicalangles ] .",
    "we see that only the mps with momentum @xmath72 and @xmath99 are extremely accurate .",
    "all other states , especially those around @xmath111 , are much further away from the exact solutions , which is a bit surprising given the fact that the energy precision for these states is comparable to the one obtained for @xmath72 .    the spectrum that we obtain for longer chains is plotted in figure  [ fig : hb_ei_reldiffei_n50_n100_d32 ] .",
    "in this regime we have only looked at the precision of the lowest two - spinon triplet for which the exact results were obtained following @xcite .",
    "again we see that the states at momentum @xmath176 have the best accuracy .",
    "we would like to make two more remarks concerning the chain with @xmath95 .",
    "first , note that the ground state has momentum @xmath177 in this case .",
    "second , unlike in the case of @xmath60 , where for all momenta @xmath178 the lowest excitation is a triplet , we observe that for @xmath95 this does not happen .",
    "our simulations reveal that at @xmath179 the quintuplet excitation lies below the triplet while at @xmath180 it is a singlet that is the lowest lying excitation .",
    "inspired by previous approaches  @xcite we have introduced a new method for the simulation of translationally invariant spin chains with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have used an mps based ansatz that corresponds to a particle - like excitation with well defined momentum in order to obtain extremely accurate results for models where the spectrum contains precisely one - particle states . for states that can be expressed in terms of many quasi - particle excitations",
    ", we still obtain feasible results if the mps bond dimension is chosen to be big enough . in the case of the quantum ising model ,",
    "our results indicate that for @xmath82 the spectrum is built up entirely out of excitations with an even number of quasi - particles .",
    "generalizations of our approach can go in two directions : first , it is possible to adjust ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) in order to treat infinite systems with open boundary condition , which we are addressing in  @xcite .",
    "second , it seems feasible to generalize our approach to a many - particle ansatz by using more than one mps tensor in  ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) in order to define the variational manifold .",
    "we thank g.vidal , v. murg , e. rico and b. nachtergaele for valuable discussions . this work was supported by the fwf doctoral program complex quantum systems ( w1210 ) , the research foundation flanders , the erc grant querg , and the fwf sfb grants foqus and vicom .",
