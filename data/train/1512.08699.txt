    "the dynamics of two - level systems , either induced or tailored with time - dependent external fields , have for many decades been the true workhorse for quantum optics , atomic and molecular physics  @xcite and more recently , for quantum information and quantum computing  @xcite . due to the exponentially increasing interest in the latter two topics , various aspects originally studied for the purposes of atomic physics",
    "are now re - examined and developed further in the context of solid state physics .",
    "the key element in many cases is the interaction of matter with electromagnetic fields , especially light .",
    "we can crudely divide the dynamics of two - level systems into three categories : crossing of energy levels under some interaction between them , coupling of levels with external pulses , or the combination of both cases , which can be achieved e.g. by using chirped pulses . despite their simple appearance ,",
    "very few two - level models with explicit time - dependence in their hamiltonian can be solved analytically .",
    "the landau - zener model  @xcite , for which credit should also be given appropriately to stckelberg  @xcite and majorana  @xcite , describes the simplest possible level crossing case , with linearly changing energy separation and constant coupling . since in most cases",
    "we can approximate any time - dependence near the crossing point with linear behaviour , and any coupling as constant , this model has had tremendous use in physics since 1932 .    the other important model is the rosen - zener model , for which we have constant energies and a hyperbolic secant pulse that couples the two levels  @xcite . in general , the resonant case can be solved for any pulse form with the area theorem ( as described later in sec .",
    "[ areatheorem ] )  @xcite , but solutions to the off - resonant case are rare , making the rosen - zener model a strong representative of such pulsed models , in addition to the trivially solved square pulse case ( rabi model ) . in 1969 ,",
    "demkov and kunike provided an analytic solution to a representative of the chirped pulse case  @xcite , with a hyperbolic tangent function as the energy difference , and a hyperbolic secant pulse to couple the levels .",
    "the model is limited to both functions having the same time scale , but although the separate time scale case has been studied  @xcite , so far there is no analytic solution .",
    "perturbative approaches to time - dependent models address typically two different regions of dynamics . in the case of weak",
    "coupling one can use the basic perturbative approaches  @xcite , but in the case of slow dynamics , often related to strong coupling or semiclassical limit , one can make studies in the adiabatic basis , which corresponds to the instantaneous eigenstates of the system hamiltonian , also called adiabatic states , see sec .",
    "[ adiabatic ] .",
    "then one seeks nonadiabatic corrections that appear as transitions between these adiabatic states  @xcite .",
    "a specific tool for studying the nonadiabatic transitions was developed in 1960 s by dykhne  @xcite , and david and pechukas  @xcite .",
    "this ddp approach relies on finding the complex zeros of the adiabatic energy difference .",
    "interestingly , it recovers the exact landau - zener result for all parameter regions , and its extensions provide also the exact solutions to the rosen - zener model and the demkov - kunike model beyond the adiabatic limit  @xcite .",
    "pulses with zero areas have been originally studied in the context of self - induced transparency , since a small area pulse becomes a zero area pulse after propagating a while in a resonant medium , see the excellent discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "zero area means that an integral over the pulse amplitude reaches a null value by the end of the pulse , implying typically that the pulse amplitude is an odd function in time . basically , when purely antisymmetric , such pulses are expected to do nothing in the resonant case as the second part of the pulse cancels any excitation created by the first part .",
    "however , for off - resonant cases such pulses do have an effect .",
    "as such pulse models then become yet another tool for the case of quantum control , we find that to know their properties is a useful topic for research .",
    "they also provide an interesting case for demonstrating and testing the ddp approach for parameter regions that do not correspond to the adiabatic limit .",
    "in this paper we first review general concepts about two - level systems with explicit time - dependence in the hamiltonian , with focus on zero area pulses .",
    "then we demonstrate the usefulness of the ddp approach with the sech - tanh model that has been presented recently  @xcite .",
    "although we can not yet use the ddp results for uncovering the full solution for all parameter regions , we find that when the detuning is large enough we get a quantitatively good agreement , and for other parameter regions an agreeable qualitative description .",
    "we consider the dynamics of two - level quantum systems subject to external driving .",
    "we assume the dynamics to be coherent , so the systems obey the time dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath0 written in units where @xmath1 .",
    "the interaction between the system and the external fields leads to the time dependencies in the hamiltonian which is given in the so - called diabatic basis consisting of the time independent states of the non - interacting system as @xmath2 the state is given by the normalized complex vector @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are called the probability amplitudes of the corresponding basis states . in quantum optics , this model describes coherent population transfer induced by the semiclassical laser field between the two levels in the dipole and rotating - wave ( rwa ) approximations .",
    "then the difference of the diabatic energy levels , @xmath5 , is called detuning and the function proportional to the coupling , @xmath6 , is the rabi frequency .    in general , we assume that system is initially in state one , i.e. , @xmath7 and we want to find out what is the population of the other state at some later time .",
    "this corresponds to the transition probability @xmath8 and is given by @xmath9 .",
    "the final transition probability is denoted simply by @xmath10 .",
    "another important concept in quantum dynamics is the adiabatic basis which is formed by the eigenstates of the diabatic hamiltonian .",
    "for the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) they are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "a convenient and physically motivated assumption is that @xmath13 , so that the diabatic and adiabatic bases coincide in the initial and final times which makes the comparison of the transition probabilities straightforward in these bases .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues , the quasienergies , are given by @xmath14 in this basis , the hamiltonian reads @xmath15 where the adiabatic coupling @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 and the overhead dot stands for time derivation .",
    "this coupling vanishes in the adiabatic limit , i.e. , when the hamiltonian changes slowly , and if the system is initially in an eigenstate , it stays there at all times during the adiabatic evolution .",
    "this requires also that the adiabatic energies do not cross .",
    "diabatic levels , on the other hand , can cross , i.e. the detuning can go to zero , and the diabatic basis states can therefore change their character during the evolution ; the state initially lower in energy can become the excited state .",
    "this is used in rapid adiabatic passage , where one obtains a robust complete population transfer ( cpt ) between the diabatic states by an adiabatic evolution .",
    "the condition for adiabatic evolution is given by @xmath18^{3/2}. \\label{eqn : adiabaticitycondition}\\ ] ] although the evolution is adiabatic , it is still considered fast in comparison to the decoherence and dissipation time scales of the physical system , hence the name rapid adiabatic passage .      in a resonant situation ,",
    "@xmath19 and equation ( [ eqn : scheq ] ) can be solved . with the above initial condition ,",
    "the transition probability is simply @xmath20,\\ ] ] which shows that the transition probability at time @xmath21 depends only on the total pulse area , @xmath22 accumulated at this time and not on the shape and other details of the pulse .",
    "the factor of @xmath23 in @xmath24 arises from our choice of the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we denote @xmath25 for the total pulse area of the process .",
    "it should be noted that this way @xmath8 can also obtain any value between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for example , for constant rabi frequency , @xmath8 oscillates sinusoidally .",
    "these rabi flops are also present in off - resonance but the maximum population transfer diminishes and the flopping frequency grows .",
    "the area theorem allows one to design resonant pulses which produce the exact amount of coherent excitation that is needed in a process .",
    "in particular , @xmath28 gives a complete population transfer ( cpt ) with any integer @xmath29 , @xmath30 a complete population return ( cpr ) and with @xmath31 one obtains an equal superposition of the two basis states .",
    "the latter case is very useful for quantum information purposes  @xcite .",
    "however , the parameters of the pulse must be controlled very precisely in order to obtain the exact pulse area and for it to then produce the excitation that is sought for , so this scheme is not very robust .",
    "the area theorem and such concepts as @xmath32 and @xmath33 pulses are extensively used in nmr physics , and more recently in quantum computing studies .    partly because of the area theorem , general interest in zero area pulse models has been limited .",
    "it has been shown relatively recently , however , that by going off the resonance , even cpt can be obtained in a quite robust manner @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the models with zero pulse area and therefore imposed the antisymmetry condition @xmath34 on the diabatic coupling which automatically takes care of the pulse area . with this simplifying condition , the obvious choices for",
    "the detuning would similarly be those that are either odd or even with respect to time .",
    "the case where also the detuning is an odd function seems like an interesting special case initially .",
    "although at the time of the level - crossing , @xmath35 , the coupling also vanishes , one can expect that there would be transitions between the diabatic states because of the finite time of the transition . and",
    "indeed , there generally is some transient population of the state not populated initially .",
    "it turns out , however , that simple symmetry considerations show the final transition probability to be strictly zero @xcite .",
    "this result is actually valid for any @xmath36-level system .",
    "therefore we concentrate our efforts to the case with even detuning and from now on we impose the condition @xmath37 . one further note on these symmetries : it is easy to see from the equations ( [ eqn : eigenenergies ] ) and ( [ eqn : acoupl ] ) that in the adiabatic basis the odd @xmath38 and even @xmath39 combination ( or , more generally , when @xmath39 and @xmath38 are of different parity ) will give adiabatic coupling and energies that are both even functions of time , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the rosen - zener model was originally introduced to describe the double stern - gerlach experiment @xcite and it consists of @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are positive constants .",
    "obviously , this model does not have a pulse of zero area but a symmetric one instead .",
    "nevertheless , it serves as a good reference model to understand the effects of asymmetries of the pulses to dynamics of the system .",
    "it can be exactly solved and the final excitation probability is given by @xmath46 it is remarkable that the transition probability factorizes into two terms .",
    "first term is in accordance with the area theorem since the pulse area is exactly @xmath47 .",
    "the other term controls the maximum of @xmath10 .",
    "it is non - oscillating and depends only on the detuning .",
    "however , it is also well - known that the factorization property of ( [ eqn : prz ] ) does not hold in general , contrary to the original conjecture of rosen and zener @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown for models with purely positive pulse area , that by going to the off - resonant case the asymmetry of the pulse has the consequence of eliminating the zeros of @xmath10 @xcite .     for values @xmath48 ( black ) , @xmath49 ( blue and dashed ) and @xmath50 ( red and dotdashed ) .",
    "]      a slight variation of the rosen - zener model with zero pulse area is the sech - tanh model  @xcite , given by ( see figure [ fig : stscheme ] ) @xmath51 we scale the time to be dimensionless , @xmath52 , and get the new parameters as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    actually , this model has a pulse of zero area , albeit a symmetric one , also in the adiabatic basis .",
    "the diabatic levels do not cross , so the final transition probability @xmath10 is the same in both bases . because of the usual association of the adiabatic limit with the strong coupling one , one would expect @xmath10 to vanish with large @xmath55 .",
    "however , the matter is more complicated as is obvious from the scaling to the dimensionless variables above . the adiabatic limit",
    "@xmath56 would correspond to both @xmath57 and @xmath58 but in this process the ratio @xmath59 remains constant .",
    "in fact , the final transition probability tends to unity in the limit @xmath60 , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "there this cpt mechanism was explained by the behavior of the nonadiabatic coupling .    when @xmath60 , the positive part of @xmath61 , located in the interval @xmath62 $ ] , where @xmath63 , behaves like a delta function .",
    "at the same time , the energy splitting is minimal and dependent only on @xmath43 because of @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the area theorem suggests @xmath65 , \\ ; b / a \\gg 1 \\\\ \\nonumber & = \\sin^{2}\\left[\\theta(\\tau_{0})\\right ] , \\label{eqn : pcpt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the argument has the value @xmath66.\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath67 as @xmath60 .",
    "the robustness of this scenario is ensured by restricting the detuning not to be too small @xmath68 in order to prohibit the transitions happening due to the tails of the pulse .",
    "all of the features described here are also evident in figure [ fig : sechtanhmodel1d ] showing the behavior of numerically obtained @xmath10 with different parameters .    in reference",
    "@xcite the focus was to reveal the surprising cpt phenomenon and the authors were interested on the equation ( [ eqn : pcpt ] ) only in the limit @xmath60 .",
    "the exact solution for this model is not known . in the following section",
    "we will discuss a way of obtaining a more accurate analytic approximation for @xmath10 that works also outside the strong - coupling region .",
    "we use the ddp theory , and show how it can be used to explain the above - mentioned features of the model .         for values @xmath49 ( thick black line ) , @xmath69 ( black solid line ) , @xmath70 ( blue and dashed ) , @xmath71 ( red and dotdashed ) and @xmath72 ( green and dotted ) . ]",
    "dykhne - davis - pechukas ( ddp ) formula provides an useful and often very accurate approximation for the transition probability .",
    "it is asymptotically exact in the adiabatic limit @xcite . in this limit",
    "the effect of adiabatic coupling to the transition probability becomes universal , i.e. , independent of the model and the transition probability is determined completely by the analytically continued eigenenergies .",
    "the original ddp formula reads @xmath73 where @xmath74    in the case of multiple zero points , one should include the contribution from each zero point @xmath75 to the transition amplitude and the generalization of the ddp formula reads  @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the adiabatic coupling .",
    "usually @xmath79 and this is the case also for sech - tanh model .      for the sech - tanh model , the complex transition points @xmath80",
    "are given by @xmath81 using the formula @xmath82 , we get @xmath83 this gives @xmath84 furthermore , using the identity @xmath85 , we finally get @xmath86 where @xmath29 is an integer ( @xmath87 written with capital is the principal value ) .",
    "it should be noted that the position of zero points depends only on the combination @xmath55 and , by going to the original variables , @xmath45 is only an overall multiplying factor .",
    "are denoted by black dot ( here we have taken @xmath88 ) . for the values @xmath89 and @xmath60 ,",
    "these points are denoted by a solid and dashed circles , respectively .",
    "the arrows indicate the behavior of the zero points as @xmath55 gets larger . ]",
    "the structure and the parameter dependence of complex zeros is the key to understand the dynamics of the sech - tanh model and it can be explained as follows ( see also figure [ fig : zeropointsst ] ) .",
    "when @xmath89 we have @xmath90 and therefore the argument @xmath91 starts from the value @xmath92 for both @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath93 , the argument obtains values in the interval @xmath95 $ ] and tends monotonously to positive unity as @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the inverse hyperbolic cosine is in this case purely imaginary and the imaginary part tends to zero as @xmath55 increases . for @xmath93 and for each integer @xmath29 there is two zero points corresponding to the two signs of arcosh in ( [ eqn : complextransitionpoint ] ) on equal distances from @xmath96 . for positive ( negative ) @xmath29 these lie on the upper ( lower ) half of the complex plane .",
    "for @xmath97 the other is on the upper plane , other on the lower , and these are also the zero points closest to the real axis .    the minus argument , @xmath98 , starts from the negative unity , as mentioned above , and tends to minus infinity as @xmath55 increases .",
    "therefore , the arcosh has constant imaginary part and a positive real part that gets larger as @xmath55 grows . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the positive sign of arcosh in the rhs of equation ( [ eqn : complextransitionpoint ] ) gives positive real and imaginary parts for the transition points while negative sign gives them both negative .",
    "however , the value of imaginary parts are @xmath99 , so taking all the values of @xmath29 into account , the whole `` k - ladder '' leads to structure where the zero points are symmetrically with respect to both imaginary and real axes .",
    "concluding , the zero points , infinite in number , divide into two classes corresponding to @xmath93 and @xmath94 that move parallel to imaginary and real axes , respectively , as the parameters change .",
    "also , for non - zero value of @xmath55 , there is a unique zero point , namely one corresponding to @xmath93 and @xmath97 on the upper half plane that gives the dominant contribution in the ddp formula .",
    "figure [ fig : sechtanhmodel1d ] shows the behavior of the final transition probability @xmath10 for sech - tanh model for small and intermediate values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for the resonance case , @xmath102 , @xmath10 is strictly zero due to the area theorem . for small values of the detuning , @xmath10 is oscillatory and",
    "this can be seen as a consequence of the interference effects arising from the double - peaked nature of the excitation pulse .",
    "it is also worthwhile to notice that the frequency of these oscillations is more or less independent of both @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , as is the case for positive asymmetric pulses , the zeros of @xmath10 are eliminated and it will tend to non - zero value for large @xmath44 . also , from the cpt mechanism explained in [ subsec : st ] it is clear that for large enough @xmath103 , @xmath10 will tend to unity for large @xmath55 . actually , as figure",
    "[ fig : sechtanhmodel1d ] indicates , this happens already for @xmath104 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ddp1 ] we illustrate the application of the ddp approach , taking into account the nearest zero points , to the sech - tanh model . the ddp phases ( [ eqn : ddpintegral ] ) are solved numerically .",
    "figure [ fig : ddp1 ] shows that by including only the nearest zero , corresponding to @xmath93 and @xmath97 , the ddp approach is able to give well enough approximation for @xmath10 in a large parameter region .",
    "it is clear that including only one term , corresponding to approximation ( [ eqn : ddp ] ) , can not describe oscillations at all .",
    "however , the oscillations are very mild or nonexistent for @xmath105 and then this formula provides a very good approximation indeed . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the formula ( [ eqn : ddp ] ) is already meaningful , following the average behavior of @xmath10 and for @xmath71 it practically overlaps with the exact solution .",
    "it should be also noted that for very small values @xmath44 , ddp is not concurrent with the exact solution and in that region the first born approximation , @xmath106 , is more adequate .",
    "the qualitative features of the nearest zero point ddp approximation can be understood by studying the phase integral , @xmath107    for the nearest zero point we have @xmath108 for @xmath89 and it becomes smaller as @xmath55 becomes larger ( see figure [ fig : zeropointsst ] ) .",
    "furthermore , also the integrand in the second line of ( [ eqn : stphaseintegral ] ) behaves monotonously , decreasing from the value @xmath27 to @xmath26 in the integration interval . in the crudest approximation ,",
    "the integrand is replaced by unity .",
    "actually , a small modification to that formula , given by @xmath109 , \\label{eqn : approx1}\\ ] ] is found to be in excellent agreement with the nearest zero point ddp approximation .",
    "for three different values of @xmath43 : in the uppermost plots we have @xmath69 , in the middle @xmath70 and the lowermost plot is for @xmath71 . in the left column ,",
    "only the contribution from the first zero point is included and the dashed line is approximately given by the equation ( [ eqn : approx1 ] ) .",
    "the right column shows the effect of including the two zero points next nearest to real axis in the upper complex plane . ]    the oscillations in @xmath10 could be also thought to be a result from the interaction between the different zero points @xcite .",
    "when @xmath55 is not too large , the distances of the three nearest zero points from the real axis are comparable ( see figure [ fig : zeropointsst ] ) . the right column in figure",
    "[ fig : ddp1 ] shows what happens when we try to take the oscillations appearing in @xmath10 into account by including also the zero points corresponding to @xmath94 term .",
    "although it is seen that this approximation can take some of the oscillatory character into account , giving some estimate for the frequency of the oscillation , for example , it is clearly not a very useful improvement , giving also values larger than one .",
    "this situation is not considerably altered by addition of further zero points .",
    "unfortunately , both the zero point structure and the ddp phases are more complicated than for example in the case of demkov - kunike model and this prevents the straightforward summation of all zero points in the manner of @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is presently an open problem whether including more zero points would increase the accuracy of the approximation , as in  @xcite , or even produce the exact solution when the contribution from all the zero points is included , as happens for the demkov - kunike model @xcite .",
    "it is equally challenging to find analytic or even semi - analytic solutions for the zero pulse models as it is for any other two - level models .",
    "a tempting approach is to take a known model , create a dual model by swapping detuning and coupling , and then find a way to solve the dual model with the help of the original model .",
    "therefore , a straightforward way to obtain exact solutions to models with zero pulse area would be to construct the propagator for a corresponding level - crossing model ( i.e. with @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) , if possible , and then to obtain the propagator for the model of interest by making a @xmath112 rotation , which has the effect of interchanging the detuning and rabi frequency in the hamiltonian .",
    "an example of such treatment can be found in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such a reference model , to our knowledge , does not exists for the sech - tanh model .",
    "indeed , there the rabi frequency tends to zero in the initial and final times and such a time - dependence is not usually considered for the diabatic levels .",
    "another possibility would be , after noticing their almost similar role in the equation , to interchange @xmath113 and @xmath114 already in the two - level schrdinger equation .",
    "this would be very interesting in particular from the viewpoint of the ddp theory because the structure of the complex zero points would not be altered .",
    "it can be shown , however , by using the theory of invariants of ordinary differential equations , that the only models linked in this way are trivial  @xcite .    in any case , the ddp theory , applied here to the zero - area pulses , proves once again to be a useful approach to the problem even outside the adiabatic region for which it was originally devised .",
    "in particular , it can be used to approximate @xmath10 for already quite small values of @xmath55 where the simple estimate that was used to prove the existence of cpt , namely equation ( [ eqn : pcpt ] ) , does not work .",
    "one interesting feature is also that , unlike with the conventional models , such as the landau - zener model , the imaginary part of the complex transition point vanishes instead of the point receding from the real axis as the coupling gets larger .",
    "this elucidates the fact that the strong coupling limit for the sech - tanh model is different from the adiabatic limit .    in summary ,",
    "we have reviewed and demonstrated the use and the properties of the ddp approach in solving time - dependent two - level models by applying it to a simple example of a zero area pulse model , namely the sech - tanh model . at the same time",
    "we have put forward the zero area pulses as a possible and so far neglected tool for quantum control , since by using off - resonant pulses , the self - cancelling nature of these pulses is eliminated , and even complete population transfer ( cpt ) can be obtained .",
    "time - dependent two - level models have been an important tool in quantum physics and its applications over 80 years by now , and the fact that some basic and surprising effects such as the cpt mechanism are still being found , indicates that they continue to be a crucial core concept in modelling the interaction of matter with electromagnetic radiation in the future as well .",
