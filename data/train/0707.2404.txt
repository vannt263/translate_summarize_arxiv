    "it turns out that the hypotheses ( h1)-(h3 ) do not assure the applicability of the necessary optimality conditions , being required more regularity on the class of admissible functions @xcite . for , the pontryagin maximum principle @xcite is established assuming @xmath17 .",
    "in the case @xmath18 , extra information about the minimizers was proved , for the first time , by tonelli himself @xcite .",

    "one can say that the lipschitzian regularity conditions found in the literature for the higher - order problems of the calculus of variations are a generalization of the above mentioned conditions for @xmath29 : @xcite generalizes for @xmath36 , @xcite generalizes for problems of optimal control with control - affine dynamics , @xcite generalizes for optimal control problems with more general nonlinear dynamics . to the best of our knowledge , there exist no regularity conditions for the higher - order problems of the calculus of variations of a different type from those also obtained ( also valid ) for the first - order problems .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to second - order problems ( @xmath45 ) . the results of the paper can be naturally extended to derivatives of higher order than two , but the proofs become rather technical . while existence follows by imposing coercivity to the lagrangian @xmath11 ( hypothesis ( h3 ) ) ,",
    "we prove ( theorem  [ theorem4 ] ) that for the autonomous second - order problems of the calculus of variations , regularity follows by imposing a superlinearity condition to the partial derivatives @xmath46 of the lagrangian .",
    "we observe that our condition is intrinsic to the higher - order problems : for autonomous problems of the calculus of variations with @xmath29 is trivially satisfied and no superlinearity on the partial derivatives of @xmath11 is needed , while such conditions are required in the higher - order case as a consequence of sarychev s results @xcite .",
