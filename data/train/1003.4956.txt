    "the former scenario is realized by adding a deep lattice along the axial @xmath6-direction . to quantify the sweep fidelity with a single number ,",
    "we define the characteristic rate @xmath24 as the sweep rate to achieve a transfer efficiency of @xmath25 with respect to the maximal measured value .",
    "therefore , larger @xmath24 correspond to higher transfer rates . in the case of single atoms in the dot - like sites",
    ", the result almost matches with the lz formula eq.([eqn : lz ] ) . here ,",
    "@xmath26 sets the natural scale for the sweep rate . if the filling is increased , we find an enhanced value of @xmath24 .",
    "this enhancement is even more pronounced in the case of the pairwise coupled tubes filled with up to 100 atoms ( see fig .",
    "the increase of transfer rate with atom number can already be understood within the simple two - mode model of a  double dot \" occupied by strongly interacting particles @xcite .",
    "for the case of strong interactions within a mode compared to the tunnel coupling , the lz transition is split into @xmath27 avoided level crossings , each corresponding to the transfer of one particle with a coupling enhanced by bose statistics ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "note that interactions are crucial to observe this enhancement : a non - interacting bec would result in the same transfer rate as is the case for a single particle .    from now on we focus on the the case of large particle numbers",
    ". then an effective 1d bose liquid forms in the filled tubes , and we study how the transfer efficiency to the empty tubes depends on the properties of that liquid .",
    "we control the nature of the many - body system by tuning the strength of both the transverse @xmath7-lattice and axial @xmath6-lattice potentials .",
    "both parameters strongly influence the characteristic sweep rate @xmath24 in the lz problem ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : @xmath24 is found to increase with increasing strength of the transverse @xmath7-lattice potential while it decreases when increasing the axial @xmath6-lattice depth . for very large @xmath6-lattice depth , the system is eventually driven across the mott transition in the ladder system @xcite and deep in the mott - insulating regime for unity filling , the single - particle result is restored .     as a function of the transverse ( * a * ) and axial lattice depth ( * b * ) . the insets ( * c , d * ) show the theoretical predictions using mean - field theory ( eq.([hmf ] ) ) as described in the text . ]    in order to explain this behaviour , we consider an infinite homogeneous bose - hubbard ladder with an average of one particle per rung ( see methods ) .",
    "we treat the inter - tube coherence by a mean - field approximation .",

    "the condensate @xmath37 is depleted until it vanishes at the transition to the mott - insulating state in the ladder .    within the mean - field eq .",
    "( [ hmf ] ) , the time dependence of the two modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 is governed by a non - linear schrdinger equation similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , with the effective non - linearity @xmath38 ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "we can therefore apply an adiabatic perturbation theory @xcite , in order to obtain a modified lz formula @xmath39 with an effective coupling strength @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 , with @xmath42 given in ref .",

    "the characteristic rates @xmath24 calculated in this way are shown as insets in fig .",
    "2 . their dependence on the transverse @xmath7-lattice and",
    "the axial @xmath6-lattice depth accounts well for the trends observed in the experiments .",
    "both of these trends stem from the change of the effective non - linearity @xmath43 .",
    "an increase in the potential barrier between the tubes ( @xmath7-lattice depth ) increases @xmath43 and reduces the curvature of the ground - state energy in its dependence on detuning , thus allowing for faster sweeps @xcite ( corresponding ultimately to the split resonance case discussed above for @xmath44 ) . increasing the @xmath6-lattice depth along the tubes first increases @xmath43 via an increase in the effective @xmath45 .",
    "for even larger lattice depths , however , the condensate is significantly depleted when driven towards the mott transition of the quantum ladder .",
    "deep in the mott regime all bose enhancement in the tunneling process is lost and one essentially recovers the single - particle lz results . the fact that the calculated @xmath24 goes to 1 immediately at the transition is an artifact of the mean - field theory ( eq .",
    "( [ hmf ] ) ) .",
    "quantum fluctuations beyond mean - field theory give rise to on - site particle number fluctuations and coupling between the sites even in the mott phase @xcite .",
    "this will smoothen out the change of @xmath24 across the transition , saturating to the asymptotic value @xmath46 deep in the mott - insulating regime .",
    "we attribute the slightly higher saturation value seen in the experiment ( @xmath47 ) to the fraction of doubly occupied sites that are present in the system .",
    "from the filled to the initially empty tube as a function of the final detuning for a ground state sweep ( black dots ) and an inverse sweep ( red dots ) .",
    "the sweeps were carried out at a constant rate @xmath48 and @xmath7-lattice depth of 15 @xmath49 .",
    "for the inverse sweep a sudden breakdown in transfer fidelity is observed beyond resonance . *",
    "b * adiabatic energy levels for ground state sweep ( black curve ) and inverse sweep ( red curve ) . for strong repulsive interactions a loop develops in the condensate energy level structure @xcite . in an inverse sweep",
    "the condensate becomes self - trapped as it follows the path along the upper branch until reaching the spinodal point in the outer edge of the loop ( red dot ) . beyond this point",
    "it becomes unstable and decays to the lower branch , while emitting phonon excitations along its axial direction .",
    "the dashed blue curve denotes the energy levels of the non - interacting problem . ]",
    "we now turn to the investigation of the inverse lz sweep .",
    "namely , we initialize the system with @xmath15 such that the filled left tube is the one with higher energy . we follow the population of the tubes as the detuning is gradually changed until the relative potential between the tubes is reversed .    in fig .",
    "3a we plot @xmath19 as a function of the final detuning @xmath50 for a relatively slow sweep with @xmath48 .",
    "while the ground - state sweep shows a continuous transfer of population , the inverse sweep exhibits a slightly reduced transfer for @xmath51 and an abrupt breakdown for @xmath52 once the resonance is crossed . from then on",
    ", particles are transferred back to the left tube which is now lower in energy .",
    "we will argue below that the dramatic difference between the two cases stems from the highly non - equilibrium nature of the inverse sweep compared to the near - equilibrium conditions of the ground - state sweep . in fig .",
    "3b we illustrate the two mechanisms responsible for the breakdown of adiabaticity : 1 ) axial phonons which provide a relaxation mechanism and 2 ) a loop structure of the mean - field condensate energy , which leads to self - trapping .     as a function of the scaled inverse sweep rate for different axial @xmath6-lattice depths .",
    "the @xmath7-lattice depth was 12 @xmath49 , and the @xmath6-lattice depths were set to 0 @xmath53 , 2 @xmath53 , 4 @xmath53 , 7 @xmath53 , 10 @xmath53 and 20 @xmath53 , respectively .",

    "4a shows a more detailed study of the adiabaticity breakdown for different axial @xmath6-lattice depths .",
    "we see that at fast sweeps ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath19 increases with decreasing sweep rate as expected from the standard lz problem . in this regime ,",
    "the curves corresponding to different @xmath6-lattice depths follow the typical universal scaling with @xmath55 .",
    "by contrast , in the slow sweep regime @xmath56 , this scaling is no longer obeyed .",
    "moreover , we find the transfer efficiency @xmath19 to actually decrease with decreasing sweep rate for sufficiently low @xmath6-lattice depths , indicating a complete breakdown of adiabaticity .    such a decay can be understood as follows .",
    "particles occupying the upper state close to @xmath57 , i.e. the high - energy superposition of left and right tubes , form a filled 1d bose liquid .",
    "the orthogonal low - energy superposition state forms an effective empty mode into which particles or pairs can decay spontaneously .",
    "the respective decay rates @xmath58 and @xmath59 depend on the couplings set by the interaction constant , and on the correlations in the bose liquids . to estimate @xmath58 and @xmath59 we resort to the universal low - energy description of the bose liquid in the filled mode in terms of a luttinger liquid @xcite . within fermi s golden rule",
    ", we find the decay rates to be @xcite : @xmath60 here @xmath61 , @xmath62 , relate to single - particle and pair tunneling between the upper and lower states , respectively , while @xmath63 denotes the actual energy difference between these states .",
    "the functions @xmath64 and @xmath65 are very weakly dependent on the luttinger parameter @xmath22 and @xmath66 is an effective luttinger parameter , renormalized by a non - universal phase shift due to the interaction between the quantum liquid and the particle or pair transferred to the empty lower state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and supplementary information ) .",
    "if we assume random independent decay events , then the density in the upper state obeys the equation @xmath67 . the decay is significant as long as the detuning between the tubes is less than the chemical potential set by the interactions in the filled tube . at larger detuning , which exceeds the linear phonon spectrum in that tube ,",
    "the decay process is greatly suppressed due to phase space limitations .",
    "the density remaining in the upper state can now be found from the solution of the decay equation with the rates in eq.([rates ] ) @xmath68^{-1}. \\label{eqn : decayprob}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result is valid in the limit of slow sweeps , when the time spent in the decay zone @xmath69 is longer than the shortest response time of the luttinger liquid @xmath70 . for shorter sweep times , the response is essentially that of free particles .",
    "then the single - particle lz formula eq.([eqn : lz ] ) is expected to apply .",
    "the above arguments can be extended to the mott insulator , where the opening of the gap in the excitation spectrum gradually eliminates the decay channels .",
    "this is taken into account by introducing the mott gap @xmath71 as a lower cutoff to the integral over @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : decayprob ] ) .",
    "deep in the mott phase the decay vanishes completely as the system becomes a collection of effectively decoupled double wells .",

    "the results have been calculated for different values of the axial @xmath6-lattice depth , taking into account the inhomogeneous filling of different tube pairs in the experiment ( see methods ) .",
    "both experiment and theory show the same qualitative behavior .     as a function of the axial @xmath6-lattice depth and different inter - tube tunnel couplings . a pronounced minimum of the transfer efficiency is observed prior to reaching the mott transition in the quantum ladder .",
    "this minimum shifts towards higher @xmath6-lattice depths for decreasing inter - tube couplings @xmath1 .",
    "* b * phase diagram of the meta - stable upper condensate branch computed using mean - field theory ( eq.([hmf ] ) ) . in the gray shaded area ,",
    "the upper condensate branch exhibits a loop ( fig .",
    "the datapoints represent the minima in the measured transfer efficiency as obtained from a fourth - order polynomial fit to the data in * a*. they approximately coincide with the theoretical prediction of the maximal loop size ( maximal non - linearity in the mean - field picture ) . ]    in addition to the breakdown of adiabaticity , we observe an intriguing non - monotonous change in the transfer efficiency versus the axial @xmath6-lattice depth in the crossover between the slow and fast sweep regimes ( @xmath73 ) ( see fig .",
    "the transfer efficiency @xmath19 first decreases and then increases with increasing @xmath6-lattice depth . a detailed investigation of this effect is plotted in fig .  5a ,",
    "where we show how @xmath19 changes at a fixed value of @xmath55 with increasing @xmath6-lattice depth as the system evolves from a superfluid to a mott insulator .",
    "the experimental data shows a pronounced minimum of @xmath19 prior to reaching the mott transition .    in order to explain this phenomenon , the loop structure , caused by the non - linearity and plotted in fig .",
    "3b , needs to be taken into account .",
    "let us consider the mean - field hamiltonian ( eq.([hmf ] ) ) in the weak coupling regime , far from the mott phase .",
    "extremizing the mean - field energy with respect to the inter - tube coherences leads to a non - linear version of the two state schrdinger equation ( see supplementary information ) . for a non - linearity @xmath74 ,",
    "the `` energy levels '' versus detuning develop a loop structure @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "3b , which grows in width with increasing non - linearity .",
    "such a loop structure leads to a dramatic dynamical evolution of the condensate once the resonance is crossed in the inverse sweep .",
    "first the condensate starts out far detuned on the right upper branch , which corresponds to a local extremum of the mean - field energy .",
    "in the course of a slow sweep the condensate moves along this branch as the detuning is decreased , and gets caught in the loop structure in a self trapped state . in a one - dimensional system such a state survives as a slowly decaying meta - stable state @xcite .",
    "the edge of the loop is a spinodal point of the mean - field energy where the local extremal solution disappears .",
    "when the detuning is decreased further , the condensate finds itself in a catastrophic scenario on a downward slope of the energy landscape , leading to a decay to the low - energy mode of the system via the discussed emission of phonons into the 1d quantum liquid ( see supplementary information ) .    in our case , the non - linearity @xmath43 and therefore the size of the loop structure depends non - monotonously on the axial @xmath6-lattice depth .",
    "far from the mott transition the lattice acts to increase the effective on - site interaction and with it the effective non - linearity @xmath43 , which leads to growing loop size and enhanced probability of the condensate to be self - trapped . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath19 first decreases with increasing @xmath6-lattice depth ( see fig .",
    "however , beyond a certain lattice depth the condensate @xmath37 begins to deplete significantly , causing a decrease of @xmath43 and hence an increase of @xmath19 until @xmath43 vanishes close to the mott transition where @xmath75 .",
    "5b charts the line of maximal non - linearity and the mott phase boundary as a function of @xmath6-lattice depth and the inter - tube tunneling @xmath1 .",
    "the former agrees well with the experimentally determined position of the minima in transfer efficiency seen in fig .",
    "note that the decay mechanism still plays a role until deep in the mott regime .",
    "then , however , the phonon decay channel is shut off by the mott gap and thus we recover the standard single - particle lz behavior .    finally , let us comment on the probability for the system to become self - trapped in the loop structure for different sweep rates",
    ". for very fast sweeps the behavior of the non - linear system is close to the linear one as the system is unlikely to be trapped in the loop structure",
    ". however , for slower sweeps and larger non - linearities ( leading to larger loop structures ) the probability for self - trapping is strongly enhanced .",
    "we find that the crossover between the slow and fast sweep regimes , for strong non - linearity , takes place at inverse sweep rate @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "we have measured and analyzed novel dynamical phenomena in pairwise coupled 1d bose liquids , which constitute a direct generalization of the lz dynamics in a many - body system .",
    "a particularly striking result is the sudden breakdown of adiabaticity seen in the inverse sweep , for which slower sweeps lead to lower transfer efficiency .",
    "we explained the results theoretically by treating the inter - tube coherence within a mean - field approximation valid all the way to the strongly correlated regime .",
    "the analysis lead to an effective non - linear lz problem similar to the one described in ref .",
    "the breakdown of adiabaticity in the inverse lz sweep can then be attributed to self - trapping of the inter - tube coherence in a meta - stable solution , associated with a loop structure in the energy levels , which emerges beyond a critical value of the non - linearity .",
    "we showed that the effective non - linearity decreases and eventually vanishes upon approaching the transition to the mott - insulating phase .",
    "a crucial new ingredient in the present setting is the coupling of the inter - tube coherence to the low energy excitations ( phonons ) of the 1d bose liquid .",
    "these fluctuations , treated within a quantum luttinger liquid theory , provide the necessary dissipation mechanism , which allows for decay of the condensate from the meta - stable solution .",
    "our work provides new insight into the quantum dynamics of many - body systems far from equilibrium , and constitutes a step towards extending the lz framework for treating such phenomena .",
    "an interesting scenario arises when our approach is applied to fermionic systems .",
    "the presence of an underlying fermi surface can , in particular , facilitate the observation of universal phenomena in the non - equilibrium quantum dynamics , such as predicted for the rabi oscillations in a similar setup consisting of a coupled tubes undergoing a sudden quench @xcite .",
    "another natural continuation of our work is to the dynamics of quantum spins in an optical lattice , for which the possibility of universal phenomena was suggested @xcite .",
    "* experimental cycle . *",
    "we create the array of pairwise coupled tubes by means of a bichromatic superlattice introduced in ref .",
    "the atoms are first loaded into a two - dimensional optical lattice with periodicity of @xmath77 along the @xmath7-direction and @xmath78 along the @xmath79-direction .",
    "this is achieved by ramping up the lattices to @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , within @xmath82 . in this way",
    ", we form a 2d array of tubes with about 100 particles in the central tubes . a short - period lattice along the @xmath7-direction with periodicity @xmath83",
    "allows us to split the @xmath7-lattice sites into double - wells . by ramping up this lattice to @xmath84 within @xmath85 with the relative phase set to obtain",
    "highly tilted double - wells , we achieve loading of all atoms to left tubes alone . any coupling in the @xmath79-direction",
    "is frozen out by ramping up the @xmath79-lattice to @xmath86 within @xmath87 . during this ramp time , the @xmath6-lattice with wavelength @xmath88 nm is ramped to the desired depth to tune the intra - tube tunneling @xmath20 and the relative phase between @xmath7- and @xmath89-lattice is adjusted to the initial detuning @xmath90 , with @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) the energy of the left ( right ) well ( @xmath93 for the ground - state sweeps and @xmath94 for the inverse sweeps ) .    before starting the lz sweep , we set the inter - tube coupling @xmath1 by rapidly ramping down the @xmath7-lattice and thereby the double - well barrier in @xmath95 .",
    "then we perform the lz sweep by linearly changing the detuning between left and right tube to a final value @xmath50 with a sweep time @xmath96 by changing the relative phase between the @xmath7- and @xmath89-lattice ( @xmath97 for ground state sweep and @xmath98 for inverse sweep ) .",
    "after the sweep is finished , we ramp up the barrier in @xmath95 to quench the coupling again . by applying a site resolving mapping method described in refs .",

    "the central tubes have high particle number , while more peripheral tubes have fewer particles .",
    "in quite a high fraction of the double - tubes , the chemical potential is lower than the level spacing between phonon states , and these act as zero dimensional double dots where the decay processes are absent .",

    "the expectation is that @xmath105 will decrease with increasing particle number @xmath27 because more of the tubes will fill up considerably and enter the 1d regime . in the experiment we indeed found that the saturation value of @xmath19 , in the limit of slow sweeps , decreased with increasing @xmath27 .",
