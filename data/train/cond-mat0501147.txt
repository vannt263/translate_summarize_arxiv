    "josephson junction arrays have now been studied for more than twenty years@xcite .",
    "they are of interest for many reasons . on a fundamental level",
    ", many unusual physical phenomena may occur in them ( kosterlitz - thouless transitions , and quantum phase transitions from superconductor to insulator ) . on an applied level",
    ", they have been investigated as possible sources of coherent microwave radiation , which would occur if all the junctions in the array were to radiate in phase .",
    "these studies have also been extended to josephson junctions , and arrays of junctions , coupled to a resonant cavity .",
    "when such a system is driven by an applied current , it may exhibit equally spaced self - induced resonant steps ( sirs s ) at voltages equal to multiples of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cavity resonance frequency@xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that when an _ array _ of underdamped junctions is placed in a single - mode cavity , and the array is biased on one of the sirs s , the array phase - locks and radiates energy coherently into the cavity , provided that the number of junctions exceeds a critical threshold@xcite .",
    "the sirs s are thought to occur because the cavity acts back on the array like an a. c. driving field , producing voltage plateaus analogous to shapiro steps .",
    "the physics of the threshold is believed to be that , since each junction is coupled to the _ same _ mode , it is effectively coupled to all the other junctions . thus , there is a long range interaction for which phase locking occurs when the coupling strength , multiplied by the junction number , exceeds a critical value .",
    "several models have been developed to describe these steps@xcite .",
    "these models generally succeed in reproducing many of the salient features of the experiments : sirs s at the expected voltage , and an increase in the energy in the cavity proportional to the square of the number of junctions .",
    "the models have now been extended to two - dimensional ( 2d ) junction arrays@xcite , where they show that , on a given step , the 2d arrays radiate much more energy into the cavity than the 1d arrays .",
    "however , recent work@xcite indicates that , in contrast to experiment , the numerical models always result in the junctions being phase - locked to each other whenever they are biased on a sirs .",
    "these theories have also been extended into the _ quantum _",
    "this regime is relevant when the junctions are very small , so that the non - commutation of the cooper pair number operator and the phase operator is important . in this regime , the states of the junction ( or junctions ) and the cavity become entangled , and uniquely quantum phenomena such as rabi oscillations may be detectable in suitable experiments . since such junction - cavity systems may be controllable externally , they may be useful as qubits in quantum computation .",
    "for this reason , the quantum regime has lately received extensive attention .",
    "several groups have also investigated the iv characteristics of a josephson junction coupled to a phonon mode .",
    "this system is formally analogous to the junction - resonant cavity system , in that both involve coupling between a junction and a harmonic oscillator mode .",
    "et al._@xcite have developed a model describing the coupling between longitudinal phonons and intrinsic josephson oscillations in cuprate superconductors , which , when sufficiently anisotropic , behave like stacks of underdamped josephson junctions@xcite .",
    "these theories have also been extended into the quantum regime@xcite .    in all the above calculations , each superconducting island was treated as a _ small _ object , with only two degrees of freedom : the phase of the superconducting order parameter , and the number of cooper pairs on each island .",
    "if the island is still large enough for cooper pair number and phase to commute , then these two degrees of freedom can be treated classically .",
    "one then obtains a set of classical coupled second - order differential equations describing the dynamics of the junction array . for small islands ,",
    "the phase and number are non - commuting operators , but there are still only two such operators per island .",
    "but one may often be interested in _ long _ junctions , and arrays of long junctions .",
    "in such systems , the phase difference across the junction typically depends on position along the junction .",
    "when such a junction is coupled to a cavity , its behavior may therefore differ from that of small junctions .    in this paper",
    ", we present a simple model for a _ long _ josephson junction coupled to a single - mode resonant cavity .",
    "we present our model in the classical regime , in which number and phase degrees of freedom commute .",
    "however , the model should be readily extendible into the quantum regime .",
    "we consider both spatially uniform and spatially varying coupling between the junction and the cavity . if the coupling is uniform , we find that , as in the case of small junctions , there are sirs s in the iv characteristics provided that there is no magnetic field parallel to the junction plates .",
    "but when such a magnetic field is introduced ( in the form of a soliton propagating in the junction ) , the sirs s are no longer present for _ uniform _ coupling",
    ". we will give simple arguments why the steps are not to be expected in this case .",
    "if the coupling is _ non - uniform _ , however , we find that a moving soliton in the long junction does couple to the cavity mode .",
    "this coupling perturbs the current - voltage ( iv ) characteristics of the junction , producing step - like structures in the iv characteristics , and excitation of the cavity mode .",
    "if the coupling is strong enough , this interaction produces a substantial shift in the frequency of the cavity mode .",
    "all these perturbations and steps can also be understood by simple physical arguments .    as in the case of short junctions ,",
    "some previous work has also been done treating the coupling of intrinsic long junctions to phonons .",
    "in particular , preis _",
    "et al._@xcite have treated this coupling in systems with a magnetic field parallel to the junction plates .",
    "they also find resonances and phonon frequency shifts analogous to those found in the present work , although they use a somewhat different mathematical model . besides this work",
    ", several other groups have studied the interaction of solitons in long josephson junctions with various types of harmonic modes .",
    "for example , kleiner@xcite has investigated the interaction of solitons in stacks of long junctions with the cavity resonances whose frequency and wave number are determined by the stack geometry and by the josephson plasma frequency .",
    "et al._@xcite have numerically studied emission of electromagnetic waves by solitons in stacks of long junctions which are coupled to the josephson plasma resonances of the stack .",
    "et al._@xcite , and gronbech - jensen@xcite , have considered the coupling of solitons in long junctions to externally applied microwave fields .",
    "below we compare some of these results with our own .",
    "since sirs s may occur in long junctions , they may be useful as sources of sub - thz radiation .",
    "hence , _ stacks _ of long junctions may be even more useful as such sources .",
    "since the most anisotropic high - t@xmath2 cuprate superconductors behave as stacks of long underdamped josephson junctions , these natural materials , too , may serve as a source of coherent sub - thz radiation@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we derive the equations of motion for treating a long junction coupled to a single - mode resonant cavity . in section iii ,",
    "we present numerical results obtained from these equations of motion , for both no - soliton and soliton initial conditions , and for both uniform and non - uniform junction - cavity coupling .",
    "finally , in section iv , we discuss the numerical results and their experimental implications , and also suggest some possible extensions of this work .",
    "a detailed derivation of the lagrangian for the junction - cavity interaction is presented in an appendix .",

    "our initial conditions are again such that one soliton is present.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the behavior of the time - dependent voltages at different points along the junction can be understood from the sinusoidal junction - cavity coupling .",
    "for every point on the junction , there is a corresponding point separated by @xmath180 which experiences an equal and opposite coupling to the cavity . if the coupling has a spatial dependence @xmath181 , there are two nodal points along the junction where the coupling is zero , and two points where the coupling has maximum amplitude but is 180@xmath170 out of phase . at these two maximum points ,",
    "the cavity - soliton interaction at any given time is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign .",
    "because of this feature , the time - dependent voltages at these two points should have the same wave form but should be 180@xmath170 out of phase , as is seen in figs .",
    "[ phase60_120 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this picture also explains why the time - dependent voltages along the junction are at all points equal in pairs but 180@xmath170 out of phase .",
    "the different pairs have different voltage wave - forms because the coupling amplitude between each mini - junction and the cavity varies with the spatial dependence @xmath182 . despite the different wave - forms , we have verified that the _ time - averaged _",
    "voltage difference is the same at each point along the junction .",
    "this is consistent with the picture that this voltage is produced by a soliton which passes each point along the junction with the same average frequency .",
    "further evidence of a strong soliton - cavity coupling can be seen by comparing figs .",
    "[ lower_om75_g02 ] and [ lower_om15_sin2 ] .",
    "fig.[lower_om75_g02 ] , as noted above , shows the soliton branch of the iv curve for @xmath149 , @xmath183 , and a coupling varying spatially as @xmath181 . in the second ,",
    "we assume the same coupling strength of @xmath183 but a frequency @xmath176 and a spatial dependence of @xmath184 . in both cases , there are steps at approximately the same value of @xmath126 , namely @xmath185 .",
    "these figures show that simultaneously doubling the cavity frequency and halving the coupling periodicity leaves the step height unchanged .",
    "we interpret this behavior as showing that , in both cases , the soliton is locked to the cavity mode so that it moves by a distance equal to the wavelength of the mode per mode cycle .",
    "we have also computed @xmath163 for @xmath186 and the parameters of fig .",
    "[ lower_om15_sin2 ] ( not shown ) .",
    "we find that this amplitude is much smaller than that shown in fig .  11 for the step of fig .  [ lower_om75_g02 ] .",
    "a simple qualitative explanation for this behavior is the following .",
    "the soliton has the same spatial width in both cases , but the junction - cavity coupling varies spatially more rapidly in [ lower_om15_sin2 ] than in fig.[lower_om75_g02 ] . since the junction - cavity coupling thus varies substantially over the width of the soliton in fig.[lower_om15_sin2 ] , it has a smaller effect than in fig.[lower_om75_g02 ] .",
    "thus , we expect a much weaker step - like feature in the iv characteristic of fig .",
    "[ lower_om15_sin2 ] than in fig .",
    "[ lower_om75_g02 ] , as is indeed observed numerically .",
    "the locking of the moving soliton to the mode of the resonant cavity can be accounted for by a simple analytical argument .",
    "the argument starts from the equations of motion ( [ eq : qj ] ) and ( [ eq : qc ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : bessel ] ) , back into the other equation of motion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : qj ] ) .",
    "next , we assume that the amplitude @xmath198 is small , and expand the bessel functions in powers of @xmath198 .",
    "finally , we retain only the lowest fourier components , namely those involving a constant term , and the functions @xmath199 $ ] and @xmath200 $ ] .",
    "a similar approach has been used previously in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite to treat intrinsic josephson junctions to optical phonons in high - temperature superconductors . setting the coefficients of each of these terms separately equal to zero in the expanded version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qj ] ) , we finally obtain the following three equations for @xmath201 , @xmath198 , and @xmath202 : @xmath203 @xmath204 @xmath205 where @xmath195 , @xmath178 , @xmath206 $ ] and @xmath207 is a resonant denominator@xcite .",
    "( [ eq : res2 ] ) and ( [ eq : res3 ] ) are readily solved for @xmath201 and @xmath198 in terms of the soliton velocity @xmath55 , and the result substituted into eq .",
    "( [ eq : res1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting eq.([eq : res1 ] ) expresses the current @xmath208 in terms of the soliton velocity @xmath55 , or equivalently , the time - averaged voltage across the long junction , @xmath209 . as is suggested by the resonant form of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res2 ] ) and ( [ eq : res3 ] ) , this iv characteristic has a peak when @xmath210 , corresponding to the voltage plateaus observed in our numerical results .",
    "this same approach also shows , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : qc2 ] ) , that there is a peak in the amplitude @xmath59 of the cavity mode when the same condition ( @xmath211 ) is satisfied .",
    "once again , this peak in the amplitude is observed in our numerical simulations .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "11 shows the large amplitude of @xmath59 at a voltage satisfying the resonance condition ; the amplitude of @xmath59 at other voltages is much smaller .",
    "it is useful to compare our model and results for the coupled soliton - cavity system to those of other workers . for the case of a _ uniform _ coupling ,",
    "our results are formally analogous to those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "these workers consider the response of _ intrinsic _ josephson junctions in a high - t@xmath2 superconductor coupled to an _ optical phonon _ mode within the junction . for spatially varying coupling",
    ", our numerical results for the locking of a moving fluxon to a cavity mode somewhat resemble those of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , obtained for a coupled fluxon / optical phonon system in an intrinsic josephson junction , though the equations describing the two systems are not identical .",
    "however , there is a significant difference in the physics .",
    "the anomalies found in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite : in these systems , the quantities which play the role of cavity modes are the optical phonons , which are intrinsic to the junctions themselves .",
    "by contrast , our cavity modes are assumed to arise from some cavity extrinsic to the junctions .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the type of electromagnetic mode which could produce the sinusoidal coupling we use .",
    "the electric field of this mode has a non - zero curl which varies sinusoidally with position , i. e. , it has a sinusoidally varying _ magnetic _ field .",
    "this type of mode should be readily achievable in a real cavity .",
    "the voltage steps should be achievable so long as the phase velocity in the cavity is smaller than the limiting soliton velocity @xmath58 .",
    "another way to produce this type of coupling would be actually to prepare a long josephson junction in the shape of a ring , and then to use a cavity mode with a _ spatially uniform _ magnetic field . in this case",
    ", the junction occupies the ribbon - like region between two circular rings of superconductor ; if the planes of the rings are parallel to the z axis , then the magnetic field of the cavity mode should be uniform and parallel to one of the ring diameters .",
    "this will produce a flux through the long junction which varies sinusoidally around the ring , as in our model .",
    "measurements using a ring geometry , and a _",
    "static _ uniform magnetic field , have recently been reported , in another context , by wallraff _",
    "et al._@xcite , who also show a schematic picture of this geometry .",
    "in this paper , we have described a model for a long underdamped josephson junction interacting with a single - mode electromagnetic cavity . in our model , we have assumed a capacitive interaction between the junction currents and cavity mode , but we consider both a uniform coupling and one which varies spatially along the junction length .",
    "if no soliton ( i. e. no fluxon ) is present , the junction behaves very much like a small josephson junction@xcite . in particular , there are sirs s just as in a small junction , which occur at the voltages expected for a small junction .",
    "if a soliton is present , and the junction - cavity coupling is position - independent , then we find that there are _ no _ sirs s .",
    "the absence of sirs s in this case is easily understood : since the soliton - cavity interaction energy is independent of the soliton s position , the cavity exerts no force on the soliton .",
    "if , however , the coupling varies sinusoidally with position , we find step - like structure in the iv characteristics , which arise from the junction - cavity coupling .",
    "these structures arise from the locking of the soliton to the cavity mode , so that the soliton travels a distance equal to one wavelength of the coupling interaction during one cycle of the cavity mode , or equivalently , the average soliton velocity equals the phase velocity @xmath212 of the cavity mode .",
    "we find clear evidence of the locking between the cavity mode and the junction through the time - dependent voltages across the junction . everywhere along the junction",
    ", these time - dependent voltages have the same period of oscillation as the cavity mode . moreover , the voltage differences of points separated by half a wavelength have exactly the same wave form , but are 180@xmath170 out of phase , showing that the soliton travels one wavelength per cycle of the cavity mode .",
    "we have also presented a simple qualitative argument which explains both the positions of the self - induced voltage steps and the occurrence of a peak in the radiated energy on the steps .",
    "this argument agrees well with our numerical results in the limit of weak junction - cavity coupling .",
    "if the junction - cavity coupling is strong , this simple argument does not give the position of the anomalies in the iv characteristics .",
    "instead , the voltage of the step - like structure is shifted substantially _",
    "down _ , and the frequency of the cavity mode is strongly red - shifted .",
    "nonetheless , the cavity is still locked to the soliton motion .",
    "the voltage on the steps is not absolutely constant , but varies slightly with current .",
    "when the current lies on a voltage step , the cavity is strongly excited , with a large time - averaged squared amplitude @xmath213 . if the current does not lie on a step , cavity and josephson junction are not locked , and @xmath59 is much smaller ( at least by an order of magnitude in all our numerical runs ) .",
    "this behavior is once again in agreement with our simple analytical model of the previous section .",
    "the present model could be modified to apply to a _",
    "stack _ of long junctions coupled to a single - mode cavity . in the absence of a cavity",
    ", it has been known for some time that very anisotropic high - t@xmath2 cuprate superconductors , such as bisr@xmath214ca@xmath214cu@xmath214o@xmath215 , behave like a stack of underdamped josephson junctions@xcite .",
    "coupling such a stack to a cavity is of great interest because it may provide a means for phase - locking these junctions , and hence providing a coherent source of sub - thz radiation .",
    "the dynamics of a stack of long junctions _ without _ a cavity has previously been modeled by sakai _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "a stack of long junctions coupled to internal phonon modes within the junctions has been modeled by preis _",
    "et al_@xcite .",

    "in this appendix , we present an alternate derivation of the cavity - junction lagrangian obtained in section ii . the derivation here is more general , in that we consider coupling to both the electric and magnetic fields of the cavity .",
    "we write the total lagrangian as @xmath216 the kinetic energy , k , is written as @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the ( possibly position - dependent ) dielectric function , and @xmath219 is the electric field .",

    "first @xmath261 takes the form @xmath262 where @xmath263 and @xmath264 similarly , @xmath265 takes the form @xmath266 where @xmath267 and @xmath268    there is one additional term in the lagrangian which also represents a coupling between the cavity and the junction .",
