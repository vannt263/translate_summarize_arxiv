    "the intermediate polar ( ip ) re 0751 + 14 ( pq gem ) was discovered with the wide field camera of the rosat satellite ( mason et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "the detection of coherent 13.9 minute ( or 833 sec ) oscillations in the infrared and optical wavelengths are verified by hard x - ray observations of ginga satellite . by using the optical spectroscopy and photometry rosen et al .",

    "asynchronously rotating binary systems ( @xmath1 ) , a magnetic white dwarf accretes material from a low mass companion through roche lobe overflow , possibly with an accretion disk ( patterson 1994 ) .",
    "ginga observations ( duck et al . , 1994 ) showed periodic narrow dips at 13.9 minutes which are modulated in the energy range of 2 - 6 kev , however the dip phenomena cease at higher energies .",
    "this suggests that the absorbing accretion column moves in and out of the line of sight of the observer at the rotation period of the white dwarf .",
    "subsequent rosat observations have verified the dip modulations ( duck et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "these observations have found a soft x - ray component in the light curve of re 0751 + 14 .",
    "the recent rosat observations also showed distinct soft x - ray components in other magnetic polars ( haberl @xmath2 motch 1995 ) .    in the ips",

    "a cross section of the accreting column appears to be in the form of a thin semicircular arc .",
    "modulation of the x - ray emission can result from variation of the photoelectric absorption of the shocked plasma along the line of the sight ( rosen et al .",
    ", 1988 ) or the occultation of the emission region ( king and shaviv 1984 ) due to the rotation of the white dwarf .",
    "recent analysis of pulse phase spectra of re 01751 + 14 have shown that both models are applicable to re 0751 + 14 ( duck et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "the pulse arrival times of rosat and asca observatons together with previous x - ray and optical band measurements have shown that the re 0751 + 14 is spining down with rate of @xmath4 s / s ( mason 1997 ) . in this work , therefore we concentrate on the spectral analyses of this source and we examined the unpublished archival rosat and asca data bases of re 0751 + 14 in combination .",
    "these observations have longer effective exposure times than that of previous rosat and ginga observations and have better energy resolution in energy ranges between 0.5 - 10 kev .",
    "we reexamine the pulse phase spectra , energy dependent pulses . in the analysis",
    ", we noted , for the first time , an emission line at 6.4 kev in the energy spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum of the intensity time series at low energies ( below 0.5 kev ) showed red noise which may be an indicator of blob accretion proposed for am herculis systems ( litchfield and king 1990 ) .",
    "re 0751 + 14 was observed with rosat / pspc and asca / sis and gis detectors .",
    "the pspc x - ray observations reported here were obtained between jd 2449265.70672 and 2449267.11526 with a total effective exposure time of 25874 s over a time span of 121186 s , whereas asca observations took place between jd 2449660.92359 and jd 2449663.09701 with a mean effective exposure time of 35033 s over a time span of 187769 s.    the rosat / pspc is a gas filled proportional counter sensitive over the energy range 0.1 - 2.4 kev with an energy resolution @xmath5e / e@xmath60.43 at 0.93 kev .",
    "detailed descriptions of the satellite , x - ray mirrors , and detectors can be found in trmper ( 1983 ) and pfeffermann et al .",
    "the reduction of the rosat archival data has been performed with the exsas package ( zimmermann et al.1993 ) .",
    "re 0751 + 14 source counts were extracted from a circle of radius @xmath7 which is expected to include @xmath8 of the photons from the source , according to the point spread function of the pspc .",
    "the background was determined from a source free area of radius @xmath9 .",
    "the mean background subtracted , vignetting and deadtime corrected count rate for the whole observation was @xmath10 counts sec@xmath11 .",
    "the asca instrumentation ( tanaka et al . 1994 ) consists of four imaging telescopes , each with a dedicated spectrometer .",
    "there are two solid - state imaging spectrometers ( sis ) , each consisting of 4 ccd chips , giving an energy resolution of 60 - 120 ev across the 0.4 - 10 kev band .",

    "standard cleaning for asca data was applied to eliminate x - ray contamination from the bright earth , effects due to high particle background , and hot flickering sis pixels .",
    "the reduction of the asca archival data was performed using xspec , xronos , ximage and xselect softwares . in table 1",
    ", we present a journal of the x - ray observations analysed in this work .    .",
    "jounal of rosat and asca observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath16 duck et al . , 1994 .",
    "based on long data set 19 days apart .",
    "+  @xmath17 duck et al . , 1994 and this work .",
    "( note that as an alternative method , we employed the @xmath18 test ( buccheri et al . , 1983 ) and verified the above results ) .      in order to see the intensity variations more clearly ,",
    "13.9 min pulse profiles are generated by folding the light curves in various energy ranges . in the rosat observations , more than @xmath19 of the photons",
    "are detected below 0.5 kev .",
    "therefore pspc data is naturally separated into two energy windows , namely soft band ( 0.1 - 0.5 kev ) and hard band ( 0.5 - 2.1 kev ) .",
    "for the asca observations , the sis data is divided into four energy bands ( 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 8 kev ) , and the gis data three energy bands , ( 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 4 , 4 - 10 kev ) . in fig .",
    "4 , we present pspc , sis and gis energy dependent pulse phases together with the combined sis and gis photons in all energies .",
    "a highly complex pulse shape with a general double peaked structure is evident in all three detectors .",
    "however , in the 0.1 - 0.5 kev range a single peaked structure with fast rise and slow decay is more likely . at energies above 6 kev ,",
    "again a single peak around phases @xmath20 is evident .",
    "the absorption dip around @xmath21 is clearly seen in pspc 0.1 - 0.5 kev band ( note that the dip epoch was chosen as @xmath22 in a previous paper by duck et al . , ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "a strong indication of the dip can also be seen in 0.5 - 2 kev bands of pspc , sis and gis .",
    "the dip disappears as the energy increases to higher values .",
    "there is an enhancement around phase @xmath23 in low energy band of the pspc .",
    "as the energy goes above 4 kev , the structure in the phase interval @xmath24 disappears but the structures around @xmath25 survives .",
    "high pulse fraction at low energies also decreases as the energy increases .",
    "the energy spectra is well - fitted to blackbody model at low energies and raymond smith model at high energies with a partial covering absorption model . in this model",
    "the source is heavily occulted in same phases of the 13.9 min period by the absorption of inhomogenous accreting plasma intrinsic to the source ( norton and watson 1989 ) . in general , it is expected that thermal bremsstrahlung ( or raymond smith ) is the model that fits best to the cooling shock regions around magnetic white dwarfs ( patterson 1994 ) , however it is possible to observe power - law continuum emission if inverse comptonization is the dominant effect .",
    "if the spectra have two or more continuum components and observing energy windows do not extend to the higher energies , the overall trend of the spectrum can be approximated by a power - law model .    in the case of re 0751 + 14 , the presence of absorption features at lower energies is clear from the dips of pulse profiles ( fig .",
    "4 ) . as the white dwarf rotates the accreting column occults the source periodically .",
    "this causes the absorption at lower energies , while the high energy photons escape through the accreting column .",
    "the possible confirmation of this feature is to see significant increase in the photoelectric absorption during the dips of the pulses . indeed , in the fits with the partial covering absorption model , one of the absorbers with a value of @xmath26 @xmath27 showed a significiant increase during the dips of the pulses ( see table 3 , fig .",
    "by contrast , the single absorber models gave insignificant changes in the photoelectric absorption during dips .",
    "it is also very interesting to note that the equivalent width @xmath28 ev of the fluoresence emission line at 6.4 kev and the observed column density in the partial covering model are consistent with empirical relations obtained between the equivalent widths and column densities in several accretion powered x - ray binaries ( inoue 1985 ) .",
    "this empirical correlation suggests that the observed fluoresence emission line requires high column densites and supports the partial covering model which can provide the high column density .",
    "another interesting feature is the low frequency noise ( or red noise ) in the soft x - ray emission ( see fig .",
    "3a ) , namely blackbody component of the x - ray radiation . for an assumed 400 pc source distance ( patterson 1994 )",
    "effective area for the blackbody model from pspc data is only @xmath29 of the surface area of typical white dwarf .",
    "this area is comparable with polar cap regions .",
    "low frequency noise suggests the presence of blobs or clumps in accretion .",
    "our observation that low frequency noise is present only in the soft energy channels , which we associate with blackbody emission from near the star s surface , then implies that such blobs are formed in the accretion column near the polar caps .",
    "the small cap area would promote shocks and instabilities to lead to clump formation .",
    "the blackbody radiation near the surface of the white dwarf is then not smooth , following the clumpiness of the accretion .",
    "this leads to low frequency noise in the x - ray power spectra . on the other hand thermally cooling plasma at the shock regions radiates as optically thin plasma at higher photon energies and the high density plasma cause the fluoresence emission line at 6.4 kev .",
    "in this work , we have presented archival rosat and asca observations of interpolar re 0751 + 14 .",
    "we resolve a fluorescence line at 6.4 kev with an equivalent width @xmath0 ev for the first time in this source .",
    "the pulse phase spectra of this source showed a significant increase in the absorption at the dips of pulse phase .",
    "the phase resolved spectra can be fitted with a single absorber blackbody plus power law model or by a partial covering model with a blackbody plus raymond - smith .",
    "our findings for low frequency noise at low energies and the correlation of the line width with column density find a natural explanation in a two component model with partial covering , which we therefore favour . in the power spectrum analysis",
    ", we have seen a red noise component at low energy channels . by combining the previously found ( and verified in this work ) soft spectral component ( duck et al . , 1994 ) together with red noise at low frequencies we concluded that the blob accretion to polar caps of the white dwarf is quite possible ( litchfield and king 1990 ) .",
    "a separate component which is associated with the post - shock flow near the surface , emits hard x - rays rather smoothly , hence , power specral analysis does not show a low frequency noise at high energy channels .",
    "therefore , our findings strongly suggest that there is an evidence of cold matter surrounding the plasma with @xmath30@xmath27 .",
