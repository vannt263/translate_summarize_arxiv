    "the momentum can take discrete values @xmath98 for integer @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",
    "note that in this case we are not mapping from a putative spin system using the jordan - wigner transformation , so there is no separation of the spectrum into ramond and neveu - schwarz sectors . using the mode expansion we obtain the chain hamiltonian @xmath101 with chain index @xmath102 .",
    "we can build a 2d quantum system from an array of @xmath2 of these chains coupled with a nearest neighbor interaction ( here we assume our 2d system is a torus ) @xmath103 where the coupling strength is @xmath104 .",
    "this chain array system @xmath105 can be solved trivially by fourier transformation from chain index @xmath102 to momentum @xmath106 ( note this is transverse to the momentum index @xmath99 _ along _ the chains ) . @xmath107 the hamiltonian is diagonal in @xmath99 and @xmath108 : if so desired it can be treated as either a set of @xmath2 1d uncoupled bands indexed by @xmath108 , or infinitely many 1d bands , indexed by @xmath99 . in either case",
    "the system can then be treated by standard 1d mps methods , because the lack of coupling between bands means that one needs to keep only those eigenstates from the spectrum of @xmath109 that are present in the initial state of the chain array . beyond this",
    "the cutoff @xmath9 does not play a role .",
    "for example consider the initial state @xmath110 in which alternating pairs of chains are entangled , with a superposition of ground states ( @xmath111 ) and lowest excited states ( @xmath112 ) on the chains .",
    "evolving this state under @xmath113 does not involve any other states from the chain spectrum .",
    "for such an evolution the return probability can be calculated exactly using a determinant method , yielding @xmath114 with @xmath115 matrices .",
    "we compare this result ( evaluated for a torus of @xmath116 chains ) with the itebd result computed with our code implementing @xmath113 in fig .",
    "[ fig : free ] .",

    "inset : enlarged region showing the determinant calculation and itebd with different @xmath15 parameter.,width=326 ]      the structure of the spectrum of the continuum limit ising chain is detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite but we give a brief description here for convenience .",
    "the spectrum splits into two sectors , neveu - schwarz ( ns ) and ramond ( rm ) .",
    "the energy of a state with a particular fermion configuration is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 or @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the vacuum energy ( different in the two sectors ) .",
    "for the disordered phase of a chain , @xmath122 , states with even numbers of particles ( including the 0 particle vacuum state ) are in the ns sector ( @xmath123 ) , while odd particle states are in the ramond sector ( @xmath124 ) the spin operator , @xmath125 , is off diagonal in sector , so that on an individual chain rm states are only scattered into ns states and vice - versa by the @xmath1 term .",
    "this fact that makes perturbative calculations significantly easier . as a consequence the overall sector ( whether there is a odd or even number of ramond chains ) is conserved by @xmath126 .",
    "the total sector and momentum ( along the chain direction ) for two chains is also conserved by the two chain time evolution operator .",
    "these conservation laws are useful for performing matrix operations by sub blocks .",
    "the fermionic representation is symmetric with respect to the spin direction , as is our pre - quench state , and @xmath126 itself does not break this symmetry .",
    "hence the local magnetization @xmath127 is always zero .",
    "we implement itebd @xcite using the alteration due to hastings @xcite that improves numerical robustness by removing the need to divide by very small singular values .",
    "before computing expectation values the itebd transfer matrix must be ` orthogonalised ' as described in refs .",
    "@xcite .    instead of imposing a fixed bond dimension , we perform tebd and itebd using a cutoff on the minimum singular value that is retained , @xmath15 .",
    "this translates to a minimum eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix , @xmath128 .",
    "the advantage over fixed bond dimension is that when working with large matrices , one may drop unwanted singular values as individual sub blocks are processed , as opposed to recording the full results of the singular value decomposition and sorting by magnitude before truncating . in principle",
    "the maximum value of @xmath7 that can be captured in this way is @xmath129 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] we give an example of convergence in this parameter and compare with a version of the algorithm that uses a fixed bond dimension throughout .     for @xmath34 , @xmath130 , using a smallest retained singular value criterion , @xmath131 ( the largest bond dimension used during the calculation",

    "also shown for comparison is data collected using a fixed bond dimension , @xmath16.,width=326 ]    we mainly use the second order trotter decomposition in this work , and find it sufficient for the time scales we are able to reach before bond dimension , @xmath16 , becomes the limiting factor . for very weak quenches however , a first order trotter decomposition still gives good results , even to quite large times .",
    "this is because the leading error term in the decomposition is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "a more sensitive test is whether the sharp non - analytic features in the return probability ( loschmidt echo ) for @xmath67 are well converged in the time step @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : timestep ] shows the logarithm of the return probability for @xmath133 and @xmath134 using second order trotter decompositions .",
    "there is negligible difference except in the immediate approach to the non - analytic point , and even in this case the difference is less than @xmath135 .",
    "( in units of @xmath136 ) . left panel : in the perturbative ( @xmath31 ) limit results converge extremely quickly as a function of @xmath14 , for both 1st order ( @xmath137 ) and 2nd order ( @xmath138 ) trotter decompositions .",
    "right panel : at the other extreme , for @xmath139 we see that the sensitive placement of non - analytic points is converged for sufficiently small @xmath14.,width=326 ]          the number of chain states increases approximately exponentially with @xmath9 and @xmath0 for @xmath141 . in table",
    "[ tab : num_chainstates ] we show the number of chain states kept for a range of chain lengths and cutoffs .",
    "it is clear that changing @xmath9 from @xmath142 to @xmath79 ( for example ) has a much more dramatic effect on the number of included states at @xmath54 than at @xmath52 .",
    "however with quenches below the critical coupling @xmath143 , we find that in general we see very little difference between @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 .      for a single chain there should be a crossover to effective 0d ( 0 + 1 dimensional )",
    "behaviour when the correlation length is of order the system size , @xmath147 .",
    "when @xmath148 only the chain ground state and lowest excited state survive with the energies of higher excited states scaling as multiples of @xmath149 .",
    "for @xmath122 the ground and first excited states are the neveu - schwarz vacuum and the zero momentum single particle ramond states respectively . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian of the coupled chain system becomes @xmath150,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 .",

    "for example at @xmath157 , and by using @xmath9 to restrict the number of chain states to two , we are able to successfully reproduce the predicted positions of non - analytic points , for quenches of the 1d quantum ising model through its critical point @xcite .      , at position @xmath158 on chain @xmath5 , scaled by the interchain coupling , @xmath159 , squared .",

    "the expectation of an operator @xmath162 at time @xmath59 after the quench ( assuming that the pre quench hamiltonian commutes with it , @xmath163=0 $ ] ) is given to order @xmath164 by @xmath165 where @xmath166 is a tensor product of unperturbed chain states , @xmath167 . in this work",
    "we choose the pre quench state to be the ground state of the uncoupled chain system , @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the ground state of chain @xmath5 . for the operator @xmath162 we consider @xmath170 , the occupation number for a fermion on chain @xmath5 with momentum @xmath171 ( along the chain ) . with these choices the only states that contribute to @xmath172 for the quantum ising system are tensor products of chain vacuum states , with a single nearest neighbor pair of chain excited states : @xmath173 using these states we find @xmath174,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath175 is the energy of the ( unperturbed ) chain state @xmath176 .",
    "the restriction on the sum indicates that the momenta of the chain states @xmath177 must sum to zero . for the expectation at time @xmath59 we obtain @xmath178 here @xmath179 and the restriction on the sum is as above .",
    "the sum over @xmath180 will contribute a simple factor of @xmath181 unless the system is an open cylinder and @xmath182 , in which case one of the sums vanishes due to the missing nearest neighbor .",

    "is a sum of oscillatory terms with no ` decay ' even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there are no boundary effects , excepting the trivial factor of @xmath181 described above due to the different number of nearest neighbors",
    ". with disordered chains , for which the chain ground state is in the neveu - schwarz sector , only excited chain states of the ramond sector will contribute .",
    "consequently at this order @xmath184 will be zero for half integer momenta , @xmath185 .    using the above we calculate the occupation numbers perturbatively for a large range of @xmath171 by evaluating the sums over states numerically .",
    "from these results it is simple to to find the position space occupation : @xmath186 using translational invariance along the chains , provided the @xmath170 drop off sufficiently rapidly with @xmath171 .",
    "we show our results for @xmath187 together with the perturbative curve ( dashed curve ) for @xmath34 in fig .",
    "[ fig : n_i_x_j0_01 ] .",
    "the agreement is excellent at short times and still very good at longer times for @xmath47 .      in this portion of the supplemental material",
    "we argue that the appearance of non - analyticities in the return probability post - quench can be used to estimate the value of the critical coupling @xmath143 marking the phase transition ( although see discussion below ) . to this end",
    "we employ the observation of @xcite that in quenching from an initial value of the coupling , @xmath188 , to a final value of the coupling , @xmath189 , non - analyticities appear in the return probability whenever a fermionic mode ( of the post - quench hamiltonian ) has an occupation of at least @xmath190 , i.e. appears with an occupation corresponding to either infinite or negative temperatures . in the case considered in @xcite , these athermal occupations only occurred if the coupling crossed a phase boundary .",
    "the appearance of the non - analyticities can then be used to estimate the location of these boundaries .",
    "however it is at least possible that in general interacting models ( such as the xxz spin chain considered in @xcite , such occupations can be induced without crossing a phase boundary .",
    "we will use low order perturbation theory to estimate the coupling @xmath143 at which athermal mode occupations appear , noting that because of the work of @xcite that this @xmath143 may not correspond to the critical coupling determining the equilibrium phase transition in the two dimensional quantum ising model .",
    "the modes that we will consider in this argument take the form @xmath191 where @xmath192 is an operator on the j - th chain that creates a fermion with momentum @xmath193 along the chain .",
    "we then want to find the minimum value of @xmath1 such that @xmath194 where @xmath195 is the initial state of the quench ( here the ground state of the system for @xmath196 ) .",
    "the mode for which this will first occur is @xmath197 as this is the mode with the lowest energy that couples to the perturbation , and so is easiest to drive athermal .    to compute @xmath198",
    "we expand it in terms of the eigenstates @xmath199 of the post - quench hamiltonian @xmath200 we will suppose that this sum is dominated by states involving at most one fermion on any given chain .",
    "the only such state @xmath201 that then contributes to this sum is @xmath202 . while we can not write down an exact expression for this state as a function of @xmath1 , we are able to write down to second order the contribution to this state coming from the @xmath203 vacuum @xmath204  the only part that matters in computing the overlap @xmath205 . to second order",
    "we have @xmath206 we use here the conventions and notation of @xcite .",
    "in particular @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "thus to second order in @xmath1 we have @xmath209 for @xmath210 the value of @xmath211 at which @xmath212 is @xmath213 .",
    "while this value of @xmath29 is considerably larger than the value of @xmath214 given in @xcite for where the equilibrium phase transition occurs , we can at least partially attribute this difference to the neglect both of terms higher order in @xmath1 in this computation as well as @xmath203 states involving more than one fermion per chain .",

    "<S> the advent of ultra cold atomic gas experiments has led to a surge of interest in the time evolution and out - of - equilibrium behaviour of many - body quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> much effort has been focused on one dimensional ( 1d ) problems because these can be tackled by analytically tractable or highly accurate numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> key questions that these studies have sought to elucidate are whether and how such systems thermalise after a sudden change , or ` quantum quench ' of a system s hamiltonian ; with particular emphasis on the role played by conserved charges in 1d integrable systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments however , are not limited to 1d and it is interesting to explore similar questions in two dimensions ( 2d ) and above @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately there is no analogue in 2d of the aforementioned analytically exact 1d methods . </S>",
    "<S> numerical approaches using matrix product state ( mps ) representations , so successful in 1d , suffer in 2d due to the ` area law ' growth of entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this growth reduces the efficiency of mps ( and related ` tensor ' ) algorithms and limits them to smaller system sizes .    </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless mps algorithms can be applied in 2d , by labeling lattice sites ( usually in a zigzag fashion ) to map to a 1d system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cost is that nearest neighbor interactions in 2d are mapped to increasingly long ranged 1d interactions , imposing an increasing numerical burden . </S>",
    "<S> recently progress has been made in performing real time evolution on mps with such long ranged hamiltonians by two different routes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> algorithms based on generalizations of mps to higher dimensions , such as projected entangled pair states ( peps ) @xcite , make use of imaginary time evolution to find ground states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however these higher dimensional tensor methods have not been applied to real time evolution . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that _ real _ time evolution is possible for large 2d systems by combining information coming from exactly solvable models with a highly anisotropic mps formulation . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach retains the contraction efficiency of matrix product states over other tensor methods , while avoiding the build up of long ranged interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our setup will be similar to that used in the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) studies described in refs . </S>",

    "<S> in particular using time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) @xcite we demonstrate that we can study the time evolution after a quench of infinitely long cylinders , with sufficient circumference that we approach the 2d thermodynamic limit . </S>",

    "<S> this exact knowledge means that we begin with the numerics already having accounted for much of the strong correlations of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize our use of exactly solvable models as a building block is not much of a limitation to the method . </S>",
    "<S> such models are ubiquitous in 1d , including heisenberg spin chains , luttinger liquids , and hubbard models to name but a few @xcite . in this framework , a state of a system of @xmath2 chains is written in mps form via @xmath3 } \\cdots a^{\\sigma_n [ n]}|\\sigma_1\\cdots\\sigma_n\\rangle \\label{eq : mps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where each matrix @xmath4}$ ] is labelled by a chain @xmath5 and an eigenstate of that individual chain @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> like the single sites used in 1d mps algorithms , we are able to manipulate these chain eigenstates because we know their energies and matrix elements for any relevant operator . for ground and low - lying states of the system </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement entropy @xmath7 scales as the boundary ` area ' , that is to say the chain length . by keeping the chain length finite we can throttle the growth of @xmath7 . by partnering this with the fact </S>",
    "<S> that for the systems that we will study , finite size effects are _ exponentially suppressed _ , we are able to keep @xmath7 small while remaining in the 2d thermodynamic limit . we have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of this methodology in equilibrium by studying a 2d quantum ( i.e. @xmath8 dimensional ) critical point @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuum 1d subunits will necessarily have an infinitely large hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> however if the system size @xmath0 is finite the spectrum is discrete , and we may truncate at a cutoff energy @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this step is justified by appeal to the truncated conformal spectrum approach @xcite where it has been observed over a wide body of examples @xcite that for _ relevant _ ( in the renormalisation group sense ) interchain interactions , the low energy sector of a perturbed integrable system is formed primarily from ( possibly strong ) admixtures of low lying states of the unperturbed system . </S>",

    "<S> it is also important to take advantage of good quantum numbers and to perform matrix operations ( e.g. singular value decompositions ) in a block diagonal manner , to help preserve the sparse nature of the matrices and increase numerical efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> mps time evolution algorithms may then be implemented just as for a 1d system , including tebd @xcite and its infinite counterpart ( itebd ) @xcite . for the former we may work with a torus or open cylinder geometry ; the latter corresponds to an infinitely long cylinder . </S>",

    "<S> the error at each step is proportional to the time increment @xmath14 raised to a power given by the order of the decomposition .    </S>",
    "<S> a more important source of error is the compression of the mps after each step via schmidt decompositions . </S>",
    "<S> we compress by fixing a minimum singular value size , @xmath15 : singular values smaller than this threshold value are discarded . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm is adaptive , as @xmath16 , and the degree of encoded entanglement can grow . ` lieb - robinson ' </S>",

    "<S> inset : the nearest neighbor spin - spin correlation function showing scaling with @xmath29 and @xmath0.,width=326 ]    in the following we present results of quantum quenches where the initial state of system corresponds to the @xmath36 ground state , whereupon at @xmath37 we turn on a finite interchain coupling @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus mainly on results for infinitely long cylinders , leaving a discussion of the effect of finite chain number , @xmath2 , until the end . </S>",
    "<S> we first address the question of what time scales we expect to feature in the quench . to provide a partial answer we turn to the quasiparticle causality picture of refs . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the energy imparted by the quench produces quasiparticle excitations which are entangled on a length scale @xmath38 along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> intrachain scattering then only has an effect after a time , @xmath39 . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the time scale governing interchain scattering can be estimated using fermi s golden rule to be @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the final time scale of import is that encoding the chain length , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this scale , given by @xmath41 , describes the time for two quasiparticles , created at the same point and moving in opposite directions , to travel around a chain and then meet again . </S>",
    "<S> hence there is a region , @xmath42 , where we may expect the time evolution to be representative of the 2d thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> but for @xmath43 the finite nature of the chains circumferences will play a role . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that @xmath33 does not govern the time scale for revivals in the system . </S>",
    "<S> instead these occur on a much longer time scale , @xmath44 where @xmath2 is the number of chains in the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus in our itebd simulations , we never expect to see strict revivals .    to illustrate these time scales in operation , we consider the occupation number , @xmath45 , for a fermionic mode on chain @xmath5 , a simple measure of how the system departs from the initial state , for which @xmath46 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 we present how @xmath47 evolves with time for a quench to @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of our perturbative results for very small @xmath29 @xcite , we plot @xmath49 in units of @xmath32 for all four quenches presented . </S>",
    "<S> these four quenches correspond to four different chain lengths , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that at short times , the results for @xmath50 collapse onto a single curve as a function of @xmath51 . as time increases , </S>",
    "<S> the curves cease to track one another . </S>",
    "<S> the first to do this is the @xmath52 curve , then the @xmath53 curve , and then finally the @xmath54 curve . </S>",
    "<S> the time at which this happens corresponds , roughly , to @xmath33 , the scale on which the quench explores the finite length of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> we expect a small departure from this time scale because a finite @xmath29 will renormalize the quasiparticle velocity @xmath55 in @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we also see from the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 that the evolution at longer times is no longer described by perturbation theory .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we explore a quench to a @xmath29 which exceeds @xmath56 , the critical coupling for the @xmath8 dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> such a quench is among the most challenging numerically as the population of higher energy chain states becomes significant . </S>",
    "<S> concomitantly , the time evolution is most dependent on @xmath9 in this case . </S>",
    "<S> ramped , rather than sudden , quenches can be implemented with some possible advantages in this regard @xcite , though we have not yet explored this possibility . nonetheless in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 we see that for a given chain length , @xmath0 , we can find cutoffs , @xmath9 such that the time evolution is converged .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible to calculate postquench correlations between the chains . </S>",
    "<S> we show the nearest neighbor spin  </S>",
    "<S> spin correlation function as a function of time , @xmath57 , for a selection of @xmath0 and @xmath29 in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n_i_x_j0_2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> our choice of @xmath58 favors antiferromagnetic correlations , producing the overall negative sign . </S>",
    "<S> an expansion in small @xmath59 shows that this quantity is proportional to @xmath60 allowing us to collapse the results onto a single curve at short times . </S>",
    "<S> here we see signatures of both the @xmath61 and @xmath33 scales . in the inset </S>",
    "<S> we have marked the intrachain scattering time @xmath61 , for the system with @xmath54 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> it is visible as the time that the @xmath62 and @xmath63 data begin to diverge . </S>",
    "<S> we also mark the time scale @xmath33 at which the data for chains with @xmath64 begins to diverge from that of @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> , for @xmath53 for @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> non - analytic behaviour is seen at short times for a quench to @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> we find no non - analytic points for the corresponding quench to @xmath62 , even at longer times up to @xmath68 ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : comparison of the infinite chain number system data with a system with @xmath69 chains computed using tebd . </S>",
    "<S> the first non - analytic point for the infinite cylinder forms the edge of a plateau , whereas for a finite number of chains it takes the form of a peak.,width=326 ]    to show that our method can handle non - trivial aspects of quenching through the critical coupling of the coupled chain system , we search for non - analyticities in the loschmidt echo as a function in time . </S>",
    "<S> the ` loschmidt echo ' or overlap probability at a particular @xmath59 is the modulus squared of the overlap between the initial and time evolved state : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the ground state of the uncoupled chain system . in 1d </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to define a per site rate function , @xmath72 via @xmath73 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> non - analyticities in @xmath72 have been interpreted as ` dynamical phase transitions ' , following an exact calculation of this quantity for the 1d tfim @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the general association of such non - analytic points with equilibrium critical phenomena is contested @xcite , but we demonstrate analytically in low order perturbation theory@xcite that for quenches to @xmath74 we expect non - analyticities in @xmath75 . while this estimate for the value of @xmath29 is larger than @xmath56  because of the low order to which we took the computation  it does suggest that simple perturbation theory for the quantity @xmath75 can be used to estimate the phase boundaries in some 2d quantum systems .    in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : loschmidt ] we plot @xmath76 for a quench to @xmath67  a value of @xmath29 where we should see non - analyticities . in 2d </S>",
    "<S> this quantity scales with system volume @xmath77 , as does its 1d counterpart @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also scales with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> as expected we find non - analytic behaviour for this quench , within the time window we are able to simulate , and see that the non - analyticity has the same qualitative structure for both @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath76 for a quench to @xmath48 , where in contrast we find that this quantity is smooth within our simulation window . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that non - analyticities appear for the same quantity with @xmath80 ( not plotted ) , just above @xmath81 , but they first occur only at the edge of the attainable times with itebd .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we consider the case of finite length and open boundary conditions . the tebd algorithm is slower by approximately a factor of @xmath2 due to the loss of translational invariance along the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> we find negligible effect , for finite @xmath82 and @xmath5 away from the ends of the cylinder , on the results for local quantities such as @xmath47 ( up to the time scales we reach ) . </S>",
    "<S> however this is not true for the loschmidt echo ( a global measure ) , especially when @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : loschmidt ] shows the difference between the itebd and @xmath69 results for @xmath84 . while there is excellent agreement up to @xmath85 ( not shown ) , afterwards there is a clear change in the non - analytic point structure . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that this effect is even more pronounced for very small @xmath0 and large @xmath2 ( where our model reduces to a single 1d tfim ) , suggesting that boundary conditions have a non - negligible effect on the loschmidt echo even for large systems . </S>",
    "<S> this last result has important consequences for possible experimental investigations . </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions : * we have demonstrated a robust method to compute dynamical behaviour in 2d quantum ( d=2 + 1 ) systems after a quench , which we intend to use to study other systems including coupled quantum wires ( i.e. coupled luttinger liquids ) and heisenberg chains . </S>",
