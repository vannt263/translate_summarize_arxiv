    "one of the most useful and striking property in stochastic calculus is probably the _ martingale representation property _ ( mrp ) . given a @xmath3-dimensional martingale @xmath6 with respect to a filtered probability space @xmath7}),\\p)$ ] , we say that @xmath2 enjoys mrp if for every @xmath4-(local ) martingale @xmath8 , there exists an integrable predictable process @xmath9 such that @xmath8 can be decomposed as : @xmath10 alternatively , mrp entails that for every integrable @xmath11-measurable random variable @xmath12 , there exists an integrable predictable process @xmath9 such that @xmath13 which is a direct consequence of by representing the martingale @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "this second formulation is well - known under the name of clark - haussmann - ocone formula .",
    "relations of the type - are very useful in applications , like for example in financial mathematics , where @xmath12 represents a contingent claim and @xmath9 a strategy which loosely speaking allows one to replicate `` optimally '' ( in some sense to be precised ) in a dynamic and predictable way this claim .",
    "mrp is a very strong property and unfortunately usually fails to hold for a given martingale @xmath2 . indeed , according to the , by now , classical theory ( see _ e.g. _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.6 ) or @xcite ) , mrp is basically equivalent to the fact that @xmath15 is an extreme point of the set of martingale measures for @xmath2 . since this is usually not the case , a relation of the form can not hold true for a given @xmath4-martingale @xmath8 and one as to consider in addition of @xmath9 , a martingale @xmath16 strongly orthogonal to @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath17 ) such that is replaced with the so - called galtchouk - kunita - watanabe decomposition : @xmath18 note , besides , that the absence of mrp for a martingale @xmath2 is not a quantitative statement , that is , we do not know a priori which are the martingales @xmath8 for which the component @xmath16 is really needed .",
    "this remark leads to the following question .",
    "can we characterize the martingales @xmath8 ( or the random variables @xmath12 ) on @xmath19}),\\p)$ ] for which a representation of the form ( or ) holds ? or , at least , can we provide a class of martingales @xmath8 or of variables @xmath12 which fulfill - ?",
    "an even more complex question , related to the first one , is to study a generalization of martingale representation property , namely to study existence / uniqueness / regularity of solutions of backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) , which in our context , given an @xmath11-measurable random variable @xmath12 and a predictable process",
    "@xmath20\\times\\real\\times\\real \\to \\real$ ] , consists in finding a triple @xmath21 such that the following equation is satisfied : @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are predictable processes and @xmath16 is a martingale strongly orthogonal to @xmath2 ( here for simplicity we wrote the equation for @xmath23 ) .",
    "one is then interested , in giving conditions on the data of the equation , namely , the _ terminal condition _ @xmath12 and on the _ generator ( or driver ) _ @xmath24 , under which the orthogonal component of the solution @xmath16 vanishes . +   + the objective of this paper is three fold .",
    "first for specific martingales @xmath2 , we provide a class of martingales @xmath8 or of random variables @xmath12 for which their representation with respect to @xmath2 holds without any orthogonal component like in or .",
    "more precisely , assuming that @xmath2 is a square - integrable martingale which is at the same time a strong markov process with respect to a filtration @xmath25}$ ] , we prove in theorem [ th : main ] that every integrable random variable of the form @xmath0 where @xmath26 is _ just _ a borelian function admits a representation of the form , and also that holds for the martingale @xmath27 $ ] . at this point , we stress that no regularity assumption whatsoever is assumed on the map @xmath5 .",
    "we will say that @xmath2 admits _ a weak martingale representation property _ since all martingales of the form @xmath27 $ ] admits an integral representation against @xmath2 without an orthogonal component . in a second time , we turn to the same type of properties for quadratic growth bsdes ( qgbsdes for short ) , meaning that the map @xmath24 in has quadratic growth in the @xmath28 variable . before , proving that the component @xmath16 of the solution vanishes ( under some conditions ) we have to fill a gap in the existence theory of such bsdes and we have to prove existence of solutions in that context .",
    "note that this is not covered by the literature up to now , since the only existence results in this area are those obtained by morlais @xcite and very recently by barrieu and el karoui @xcite under the assumption that the filtration @xmath4 is continuous ( so there are no discontinuous martingales on such spaces ) .",
    "this assumption is really needed in both mentioned papers .",
    "hence in our second main result : theorem [ th : existence ] , we fill this gap and prove that under a general right - continuous filtration @xmath4 , equations of the form admit at least one solution @xmath21 ( in the good space ) when the terminal condition @xmath12 is a bounded random variable and the driver @xmath24 has quadratic growth in @xmath28 . note that for this property we simply assume that @xmath2 is a continuous martingale under @xmath4 and in particular we do not assume that @xmath2 is a markov process .",
    "we are able to prove this result by combining arguments of @xcite and of @xcite , and by replacing a monotone stability result obtained in @xcite for a special class of continuous semimartingales with a compactness type argument derived by barlow and protter in @xcite valid for general semimartingales . finally , the third main result of this paper is to show in theorem [ theorem : main ] that in a continuous markovian setting ( _ i.e. _ @xmath2 is a continuous martingale and a markov process with respect to @xmath4 ; and the terminal condition @xmath12 is of the form @xmath29 with @xmath5 any bounded borelian map , and @xmath30 denotes the strong solution of an sde driven by @xmath2 ) , the solution @xmath16 vanishes ( we refer to section [ section : without ] for a precise statement ) .",
    "this property requires additional results on the regularity of the solution @xmath21 ( given in sections [ sub : markov ] and [ sub : regul ] ) which once again are not contained in the literature .",
    "+   + we would like to make some comments about results in the literature .",
    "while we were writing the note @xcite which was a pre - version of the present paper , we realized that related results have been obtained in the literature .",
    "for instance we mention the paper by jacod , mlard and protter @xcite where the authors prove ( among other things ) a clark - haussmann representation formula for random variables of the form @xmath0 where @xmath2 is a cdlg markov martingale and @xmath5 is a deterministic map regular enough . basically the markov setting allows one to represent the martingale @xmath27 $ ] as a deterministic function @xmath31 of time and @xmath2 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath32 ) .",
    "then the smoothness on @xmath5 , transfers to @xmath31 so that one can deduce that the orthogonal component @xmath16 in vanishes . in @xcite",
    ", the authors basically assume that @xmath5 is such that @xmath31 is differentiable in time and twice differentiable in space .",
    "as we will see , in the continuous case this regularity is not needed and especially the regularity in time .",
    "our method is also based on the representation of @xmath8 as @xmath33 but our analysis differs from the one presented in @xcite .",
    "another technology presented in the literature consists in combining the markovian structure and the malliavin calculus for some particular cdlg markov martingales to get an exact representation for @xmath0 but once again under some regularity properties for @xmath5 ( especially if @xmath2 is continuous ) , we refer to the monograph by privault ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.7 ) . +   + we proceed as follows .",
    "first in section [ section : preliminaries ] we present the main notations and definitions that we will be used in our framework .",
    "then , we derive in section [ section : wmr ] the representation property for a continuous markov martingale . then in section [ section : existence ] we give an existence result for a qgbsdes driven by a continuous martingale with respect to a _ not necessarily continuous _ filtration @xmath4 .",
