    "two galvanomagnetic phenomena discovered in the 19th century , namely , the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) @xcite and the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) @xcite in ferromagnets , attract ongoing interest both in basic and applied physics .",
    "the amr of bulk systems together with the giant magnetoresistance of magnetic multilayers plays an important role in magnetic data storage , @xcite whereas the ahe is not fully understood at present despite the tremendous past and recent research activity .",
    "@xcite however , the basic origin of both phenomena is well known for a long time and it was identified with the simultaneous presence of spin polarization and spin - orbit ( so ) interaction . among open problems ,",
    "one can list , e.g. , correlations between the anomalous hall conductivities and the longitudinal conductivities reported for a number of systems , @xcite or the occurrence of large amr values and the change of sign of the ahe at the same composition ( around 15 at .",
    "% fe ) of random nife alloys .",
    "@xcite let us mention that the amr and ahe are related , respectively , to the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the resistivity tensor of the solid .",
    "for this reason , an internally consistent theory of all transport phenomena ( resistivity , amr , ahe , etc . ) represents an important task of condensed - matter physics .",
    "existing theoretical techniques for investigation of transport properties include the boltzmann equation and the kubo linear response theory which represent appropriate tools to describe electron scattering on impurities or phonons .",
    "the latter approach uses the kubo - greenwood formula @xcite for longitudinal resistivities and the amr while the kubo - steda formula @xcite is a starting point for the ahe .",
    "@xcite however , the ahe contains not only an extrinsic contribution due to the electron scattering , but also an intrinsic one that is solely due to the band structure of an ideal crystal .",
    "the intrinsic ahe seems to dominate over the extrinsic part in a number of cases ; its values are related to the berry curvatures of the bloch states of the crystal .",
    "@xcite these theoretical concepts and techniques have recently been used to address various problems on a model level , such as , e.g. , to describe quantitatively the ahe and amr in diluted magnetic semiconductors , @xcite or to develop a unified scheme for the ahe of systems with high and low conductivities .",
    "@xcite    materials - specific _ ab initio _ theory of galvanomagnetic phenomena is a straightforward extension of the model - level techniques only for the intrinsic ahe of pure magnetic crystals .",
    "@xcite transport properties due to impurity scattering , in particular residual resistivities , of substitutionally disordered alloys without the so interaction have been systematically studied by means of the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method and the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "@xcite an alternative first - principles technique has recently been developed within the tight - binding ( tb ) linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method . @xcite both approaches agree quantitatively for resistivities of metallic alloys @xcite and diluted magnetic semiconductors .",
    "@xcite the amr of random cubic alloys  based on diagonal elements of the conductivity tensor , i.e. , on the kubo - greenwood formula  have been studied in the fully relativistic kkr method ; @xcite similar results of the tb - lmto method with the so interaction included @xcite compare well to those of the kkr method again .",
    "these studies prove that the so interaction can have a dramatic effect also on residual resistivities of ferromagnetic alloys of light ( @xmath0 ) elements .",
    "an early attempt @xcite to calculate the ahe in random alloys from the kubo - greenwood formula using the kkr - cpa method was shown to be incorrect ; @xcite a correct formulation based on the kubo - steda formula has appeared only very recently .",
    "@xcite the authors of ref .",
    "have suggested to interpret the coherent part of the anomalous hall conductivity in a random alloy as the intrinsic contribution to the ahe while the incoherent part  the co - called vertex corrections  has been identified with the extrinsic contribution to the ahe .",
    "moreover , they have studied the case of dilute alloys and have shown that the intrinsic contribution exhibits a well - defined limit for vanishing concentration of impurities in contrast to a divergence of the extrinsic contribution , in reasonable agreement with experimental data for fepd and nipd random alloys .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to formulate the full conductivity tensor of ferromagnetic metals and substitutionally disordered alloys in the relativistic tb - lmto - cpa method in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) and to illustrate its applicability to the galvanomagnetic phenomena of systems containing @xmath0 transition - metal elements ( fe , co , ni , mn ) .",

    "<S> we present an _ ab initio _ theory of transport quantities of metallic ferromagnets developed in the framework of the fully relativistic tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbital method . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on the kubo - steda formula for the conductivity tensor , on the coherent potential approximation for random alloys , and on the concept of interatomic electron transport . </S>",
    "<S> the developed formalism is applied to pure @xmath0 transition metals ( fe , co , ni ) and to random ni - based ferromagnetic alloys ( ni - fe , ni - co , ni - mn ) . </S>",
    "<S> high values of the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) , found for ni - rich alloys , are explained by a negligible disorder in the majority spin channel while a change of the sign of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) on alloying is interpreted as a band - filling effect without a direct relation to the high amr . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of disorder on the ahe in concentrated alloys is investigated as well . </S>"
