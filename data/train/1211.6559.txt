    "after the recent discovery of a new boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern  @xcite one has to clarify the question whether it is the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson or a new particle of an enlarged theory . for this purpose",
    "it is important to study in detail its production and decay processes . in the sm , but also in many extensions , the largest production cross section for a higgs boson is given by the gluon fusion sub - process which , however , also has a large uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainties arise mainly from the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and from unknown higher order corrections . the latter amount to about 10% although perturbative next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qcd and nlo electroweak corrections have been computed in the recent years and are thus available for theory predictions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for comprehensive reviews ) . in view of the expected experimental precision reached by",
    "the lhc experiments it is desirable to take the next step and compute the n@xmath1lo qcd corrections to the gluon fusion process . in this letter",
    "we contribute important building blocks to this enterprise by computing the lower order partonic cross sections to higher order in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the space - time dimension , and by providing results for their convolution with the splitting functions . in our calculation",
    "we will make use of the results for the master integrals entering the nnlo calculation . in refs .",
    "@xcite results for the @xmath0 expansion are provided which are sufficient for the n@xmath1lo predictions .    the starting point for the evaluation of the cross section",
    "is the effective five - flavour lagrange density @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the usual qcd part with five massless quarks , @xmath6 denotes the higgs boson , @xmath7 its vacuum expectation value and @xmath8 is the matching coefficient between the full and the effective theory .",
    "@xmath9 is the gluonic field strength tensor constructed from fields and couplings already present in @xmath5 .",
    "the superscript `` 0 '' denotes the bare quantities .",
    "note that the renormalization of @xmath10 is of higher order in the electromagnetic coupling constant . in eq .",

    "@xcite , through nnlo the results obtained in the effective - theory approach agree to good accuracy with the ones of the full - theory calculation .",
    "we assume that this feature also holds at n@xmath1lo .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next two sections we discuss in detail the splitting functions and the partonic cross sections up to nnlo . the procedure to compute the convolution integrals is described in section  [ sec::conv ] where also some sample results are given .",
    "analytical results for all convolutions are provided in a mathematica file which can be downloaded from  @xcite . in section  [ sec::sum ]",
    "we summarize our findings .",
    "in general , the sum of the renormalized real and the virtual contributions of a given partonic sub - process is not finite in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "the remaining poles originate from the collinear divergences in the initial state .",
    "for example , the initial gluon may split into a quark - antiquark pair and the quark participates in the higgs boson production .",
    "it also may happen that a quark in the initial state radiates a gluon before participating in the hard scattering process .",
    "the correct treatment of the singularities is achieved by the convolution of the partonic cross section with the splitting functions @xmath14 describing the probability of parton @xmath15 to emit a parton @xmath16 with the fraction @xmath17 of its initial energy .",
    "the perturbative expansion is given by @xmath18 where the analytical results for @xmath19 can be found in refs .",

    "rather it is sufficient to consider mellin transforms of regularized derivatives in case mellin transforms for generalized functions are needed . for illustration we list the mellin transforms of regularized derivatives of hpls to weight one @xmath89 & = & 1\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\      m_n[\\hat{\\partial}_x { { \\rm h}_{0}(x ) } ] & = & \\frac{1}{n-1}\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\      m_n[\\hat{\\partial}_x { { \\rm h}_{1}(x ) } ] & = & -{{\\rm s}_{1}(n-1)}\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\      m_n[\\hat{\\partial}_x { { \\rm h}_{-1}(x ) } ] & = &       ( -1)^{n-1}{{\\rm s}_{-1}(n-1 ) } + ( -1)^{n-1}\\ln{2}\\ , .",
