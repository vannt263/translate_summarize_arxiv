    "individual spectra were taken on six nights over the period 2013 october 1 to 2014 january 10 , with typical exposure times of 5 min .",
    "a large radial velocity change was observed between the first and second observing nights , after which more frequent spectra were obtained .",
    "fear arcs were taken for wavelength calibration every 30 min throughout the night .",
    "the spectra were reduced in the standard manner , with optimal extraction and wavelength calibration using arcs . to help correct for the effects of flexure",
    ", we used the bright 5577.34   sky line to make small zeropoint shifts to the wavelength solution for each spectrum .",

    "after converting the mid - exposure observing times to barycentric julian date ( bjd ) on the barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) system ( eastman  2010 ) , we did a keplerian fit to the radial velocity measurements using the idl package boottran ( wang et al .",

    ", we give the bjd at the superior conjunction ( @xmath28 ; when the secondary is behind the primary ) preceding the first radial velocity measurement , which is @xmath37 d. as mentioned in  2.2 , the best - fit radial velocity period is consistent with the photometric period to within 0.4 sec .",
    "the mass function of the secondary is @xmath38 .",
    "the evidence for the presence of at least apparent eccentricity is strong : if we fix @xmath39 the resulting @xmath30 = 161/91 d.o.f .",
    ", substantially worse . in irradiated binaries",
    "a  false \" eccentricity is sometimes observed in which the center - of - mass of the system is offset from the center - of - light , due to the change in the effective temperature of the visible region of the secondary during the orbit .",
    "however , we do not see evidence for irradiation : there is no significant change in spectral type as a function of phase nor are there different mean magnitudes at inferior and superior conjunction ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "most binaries that emit @xmath2-rays have neutron star primaries ( dubus 2013 ) , so this is a natural starting point for the interpretation .",
    "irradiation might be expected for a pulsar primary : the total integrated  luminosity ( 0.1100 gev ) in 2fgl , assuming no beaming , is @xmath40 erg s@xmath13 ( nolan et al .",
    "2012 ; see  3.3 for distance estimate ) , which is typical of millisecond pulsars detected with _",
    "( abdo et al .",
    "the implied spindown luminosity is @xmath41 erg s@xmath13 , comparable to known redbacks ( roberts 2013 ) . one possible explanation for the apparent lack of irradiation is if the pulsar radiation is beamed so that it misses the secondary , or hits only a small portion of its surface .",
    "the high mass of the secondary compared to most redbacks may also help in minimizing the effects of irradiation .    in any case ,",
    "for now we consider it possible that irradiation is unimportant in the system and thus that the eccentricity is in fact greater than zero .",
    "nearly all field millisecond pulsars and redbacks have negligible eccentricity ( e.g. , phinney & kulkarni 1994 , crawford et al .",
    "2013 ) , suggesting that 0523 could be a partially - recycled system not yet circularized , or perhaps that it is in a triple with the eccentricity induced via the kozai mechanism ( e.g. , champion et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , we can not rule out other explanations for the apparent eccentricity , such as a small systematic error in a subset of the measured radial velocities .    the 16.5 hr period and 190  semi - amplitude , combined with the apparent late - g / early - k spectral type of the secondary , are consistent with a neutron star primary with a non - degenerate main sequence companion .",
    "single solar metallicity stars of this spectral type have masses of @xmath42@xmath43 ( the masses would be lower if the assumed metallicity were reduced , though the spectra in figure 2 suggest a relatively metal - rich star ) . while the implied companion is unusually massive compared to most known redbacks ( roberts 2013 ) , as we show below , the full set of spectroscopic data provide additional support for a secondary mass in this range .",
    "given the short period of the binary , the secondary star is expected to be spun up and tidally locked to the primary ( the synchronization timescale is @xmath44 yr for the mass ratio found below ; zahn 1977 ) .",
    "the rotational velocity of the secondary , when combined with the orbit semi - amplitude , can be used to constrain the mass ratio of the binary .",
    "the resolution of our spectra is high enough ( @xmath45 ) that we can estimate the projected rotational velocity @xmath46 sin @xmath47 .",
    "we do this in the usual manner for moderate resolution data ( e.g. , rhode  2001 ) by convolving standard stars with a set of kernels reflecting a range of @xmath46 sin @xmath47 values and that include limb darkening .",
    "we then fit relations between the set of input values of @xmath46 sin @xmath47 and the resulting full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) values for the resulting spectra .",
    "we then use the fwhm values derived from cross - correlating the spectra of 0523 with the standard stars to estimate the rotational velocity .",
    "the value obtained in this manner is @xmath46 sin @xmath48 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty in this value is due only to random errors .",
    "higher - resolution spectra , combined with a more realistic stellar model , could improve this measurement in the future",
    ".          the measured rotational velocity and semi - amplitude of the secondary @xmath49 immediately give the mass ratio @xmath50 of the binary via the standard formula ( casares 2001 ) :    @xmath51    this implies @xmath52 .",
    "most binaries that emit @xmath2-rays have neutron star primaries ( dubus 2013 ) .",
    "if we assume the primary has a normal neutron star mass of 1.4 @xmath53 , then the secondary mass is @xmath54 , consistent with that inferred simply from its spectral type .",
    "if the primary mass were as high as 2.0 @xmath53 , the inferred secondary mass would be in the range 1.11.3 @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding inclinations range from 75  to 59  for 1.4 to 2.0 @xmath53 primaries .    with the current data we can not conclusively exclude other compact objects as primaries , including white dwarfs and black holes .",
    "however , these classifications appear to be very unlikely : the only white dwarfs known to be  sources are novae in outburst ( dubus 2013 ) , and the spectral type of the secondary and the inferred binary mass ratio are inconsistent with even a relatively low - mass black hole .",
    "we also considered the possibility that there is a chance superposition of the x - ray source with the  source , in which case the system could be interpreted as an active binary such as a w uma ( contact binary ) .",
    "since we observe a single - lined binary , the visible star would need to be the primary , rather than the secondary as assumed above .",
    "however , given this assumption , there is no plausible set of binary parameters consistent with the observed semi - amplitude and period .",
    "thus we do not believe this is a viable explanation for this source .    in general",
    ", it is possible to obtain additional constraints on the binary properties  including the inclination and roche lobe filling factor  using photometry .",
    "while the css and sss photometric data are nominally reported in @xmath24 , the images are unfiltered , so there are significant color terms that relate these magnitudes to standard @xmath24 , and they are ill - suited for detailed model fitting .",
    "we can make the qualitative statement that the minima at superior and inferior conjunction of the ellipsoidal variations do not show significant differences , suggesting that the secondary may not be close to filling its roche lobe .",
    "if we assume that the secondary is indeed an early k dwarf that is relatively unaffected by irradiation , we can use the padova isochrones ( bressan  2012 ) to estimate the distance to the binary . using the 2mass @xmath55-band photometry to minimize the effects of extinction",
    ", we infer a distance of @xmath56 kpc , a value typical for _ fermi _  binary pulsars ( e.g. , abdo 2013 , gentile  2014 )",
    ". however , we emphasize this value depends strongly on the assumed mass .",
    "the most straightforward model consistent with all available data is that the  source 0523 is a 1.4 @xmath53 pulsar with a relatively massive , @xmath420.9 @xmath53 main sequence secondary , though systems with more massive components are not ruled out .",
    "however , the physical properties of the pulsar are uncertain .    as discussed in the introduction , many of the new pulsar binaries discovered via follow - up of _ fermi _ sources have been classified as redbacks : eclipsing millisecond pulsars with @xmath57 secondaries being ablated by the pulsar wind . besides the circumstantial association of redbacks with binary pulsars discovered via _",
    "follow - up , the principle evidence that 0523 is a redback is that it has a main sequence secondary , and that no radio emission was detected in two searches ( guillemot  2012 ; petrov  2013 ) , consistent with the temporary obscuration of the pulsar radio emission as observed in some other redbacks ( e.g. , ray et al .",
    "2013 ) . however , this is indirect evidence for ablation , and as discussed in  3.1 there is no direct evidence for irradiation .",
    "in addition , the inferred large mass of the secondary and the non - zero eccentricity are both unusual compared to confirmed redbacks in the field ( e.g , roberts 2013 ; crawford et al .  2013 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the primary is a young pulsar rather than a recycled pulsar , which could explain both the eccentricity and high secondary mass .",
    "however , other aspects of the system are less consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "the  luminosity of @xmath40 erg s@xmath13 is typical of millisecond pulsars but low compared to that of young pulsars ( although not exceptionally so ; abdo et al .",
    "nearly all young pulsars in the field detected with _",
    "fermi _ are located close to the galactic plane , while 0523 is at approximate galactic coordinates ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , corresponding to a location @xmath60 pc below the plane for the assumed distance of 1.1 kpc .",
    "in addition , the small sample of young field pulsars in binaries with main sequence stars all have b - type or earlier companions and long periods ( dubus 2013 ) , dissimilar to 0523 .          based on observations obtained at the southern astrophysical research ( soar ) telescope , which is a joint project of the ministrio da cincia , tecnologia , e inovao ( mcti ) da repblica federativa do brasil , the u.s",
