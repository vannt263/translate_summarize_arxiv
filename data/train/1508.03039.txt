    "the _ euclid  mullin sequence _ begins [ 1 , ] 2 , 3 , 7 , 43 , 13 , 53 , 5 , 6221671 , where each term is the least prime factor of 1 plus the product of all the preceding terms .",
    "as such it can be viewed as a computational form of euclid s proof that the number of primes is infinite .",
    "a companion sequence , sometimes referred to as the _ second euclid ",
    "mullin sequence _ takes the largest prime factor at each step .",
    "these sequences are a000945 and a000946 in the oeis  @xcite .",
    "both sequences were introduced by mullin  @xcite , who asked whether every prime occurs in these sequences .",
    "mullin s question has been answered negatively for the second sequence and in fact the second sequence omits infinitely many primes  @xcite .",
    "the question for the first sequence remains open .",
    "here a generalization is considered , where rather than choosing the least or largest prime factor at each stage , all prime factors are considered .",
    "since there are now , in general , multiple choices for the next element , the result is not a single sequence , but a ( directed ) graph where each path from the root to a node corresponds to a particular sequence of primes .",
    "questions asked about mullin s sequence can now also be asked about the graph . in particular , does the graph contain every prime ? if it were ever shown that mullin s original sequence contains every prime , then the graph would also include every prime .",
    "the graph admits other structural questions .",
    "while the graph is obviously infinite it would be interesting to know how the number of nodes grows at each level ( or , indeed , to determine if it does grow ! ) .",
    "as a first step in this direction , this paper establishes that the graph is not a tree .",
    "the directed graph @xmath0 consists of a set of integer labelled nodes and edges defined by ordered pairs of nodes .",
    "@xmath1 can be defined recursively by : @xmath2 is a node in @xmath1 . if @xmath3 is a node in @xmath1 , then so are all of @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , is the unique factorization of @xmath7 .",
    "further , @xmath1 has directed edges @xmath8 .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to think of the edge @xmath8 as being labelled @xmath9 .",
    "we say , @xmath2 is the root of the graph and has level 0 .",
    "any node adjacent to @xmath2 is said to be level 1 . in general ,",
    "any node reachable by a directed path of @xmath10 edges is said to be level @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , a path of length @xmath10 represents a product of @xmath10 distinct primes .",
    "we call @xmath11 the _ euclid  mullin graph _ ; its first few levels are shown in figure  [ fig : g1 ] .",
    "@xmath11.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    [ thm : main ] the euclid ",
    "mullin graph @xmath11 is not a tree . in particular ,",
    "each of the following nodes is connected to @xmath12 by two distinct paths : @xmath13 and @xmath14 in each case , the order of the prime factors indicates one path , and the other path is obtained by swapping @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that the numbers given in the theorem both have level @xmath17 .",
    "based on some probabilistic considerations presented in ",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we suspect that any node of lower level is connected to @xmath12 by a unique path , but answering this definitively is likely to remain infeasible for the foreseeable future .",
    "the numerical computations for this paper were primarily carried out using the resources of real time genomics at hamilton , new  zealand , with additional factorizations performed on bluecrystal phases 2 and 3 at the university of bristol , uk , michael rubinstein s riemann cluster at the university of waterloo , canada , and by nfs@home .",
    "we thank these organizations for their support , without which this project would not have been possible .",
    "we also thank the users of mersenneforum.org , especially oscar stlin , who helped with many hard factorizations .",
    "given a positive integer @xmath2 , a path in @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath19 can be identified with the @xmath18-tuple of edge primes @xmath20 . in this section ,",
    "we formalize this notion and formulate conditions under which nodes may be connected by more than one path .",
    "we also establish several theoretical results , including the following :    * for @xmath21 , we obtain a complete classification of the triples @xmath22 that form one side of a loop in some @xmath1 , given as the prime values of certain polynomials ; see theorem  [ thm : fibonacci ] . *",
    "we prove that there is a @xmath23 such that , for any @xmath24 , there are infinitely many @xmath18-tuples @xmath20 that form one side of a loop in some @xmath1 and satisfy @xmath25 . moreover , any given prime occurs as an edge of a loop of height at most @xmath26 in some @xmath1 ; see theorem  [ thm : manypairs ] .",
    "first , let @xmath27 denote the set of @xmath18-tuples @xmath20 , where each @xmath9 is a prime number and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "the symmetric group @xmath30 acts on @xmath27 by permuting the indices ; precisely , for @xmath31 we write @xmath32 , where @xmath33 for @xmath34 .      1 .",
    "we say that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are _ equivalent _ , and write @xmath38 , if there exists @xmath31 such that @xmath39 and @xmath40 2 .",
    "the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath36 , denoted @xmath41 , is the number of @xmath31 such that @xmath42 .",
    "we say that @xmath36 is _ multiple _ if @xmath43 .",
    "we call @xmath44 the _ modulus _ of @xmath36 , and denote it by @xmath45 .        1 .",
    "@xmath48 is an arithmetic progression modulo @xmath45 , i.e.@xmath52 for some @xmath53 relatively prime to @xmath45 .",
    "2 .   @xmath54 is equivalent to @xmath36 if and only if @xmath55 .",
    "3 .   for any @xmath56 , the paths in @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath49 are in one - to - one correspondence with the equivalence class of @xmath36 . in particular , the number of such paths is the multiplicity @xmath41 .    1",
    ".   the conditions on @xmath2 can be rephrased as the system of congruences @xmath57 and the solutions form an arithmetic progression , by the chinese remainder theorem . since none of the numbers on the right - hand side can be congruent to @xmath58 , the elements of @xmath48 lie in an invertible residue class modulo @xmath45 .",
    "2 .   suppose that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are equivalent .",
    "then there is a permutation @xmath31 such that @xmath39 .",

    "since @xmath2 was an arbitrary element of @xmath48 , this shows that @xmath67 . applying the argument again with the roles of @xmath36 and @xmath37 reversed , we also get @xmath68 , and hence @xmath69 .",
    "+ conversely , suppose that @xmath69 . by part ( 1 ) , we must have @xmath70 , and hence there is a permutation @xmath71 such that @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and set @xmath74 , so that @xmath63",
    ". then again we obtain , and since @xmath2 is invertible modulo @xmath70 , it follows that @xmath75 since this holds for all @xmath76 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are equivalent .",
    "3 .   let @xmath59 , @xmath56 , and @xmath77 .",
    "suppose that there is a path in @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 via edges @xmath78 .",
    "then we have @xmath79 , so that @xmath80 . by unique factorization",
    ", we have @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "by part ( 1 ) , @xmath48 and @xmath66 are arithmetic progressions with the same modulus .",
    "since they also have a common element @xmath83 , they must be equal . by part ( 2 ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are therefore equivalent .",
    "conversely , if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are equivalent then @xmath69 , so there is a path in @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath84 .",
    "this is obvious for @xmath86 . for @xmath87 ,",
    "the only non - trivial possibility is that @xmath88 is equivalent to @xmath89 .",
    "then by definition  [ def : equiv ] we have @xmath90 so that @xmath91 , which is impossible .",

    "wagstaff @xcite computed @xmath118 up through the 43rd term ( 180 digits ) .",
    "much computation effort , including several large gnfs world - wide distributed efforts , has since been expended on factoring the integers needed to extend the sequence . in 2012 ,",
    "ryan propper found a 75-digit factor using ecm ; it remains the fifth largest factor ever produced by ecm .",
    "table  [ tab : em1 ] is a summary of known computational results for the distinct sequences with @xmath119 .",
    "the ` @xmath120 ' column is the smallest prime not yet confirmed as a member of the corresponding sequence .",
    "the ` step ' column indicates the number of known terms and the ` digits ' column the number of decimal digits in the unfactored composite needed for the next step .",
    "the final column is the corresponding entry number in the oeis .",
    "it is unlikely that any of the blocking composites has a factor of less than 45 digits ."
