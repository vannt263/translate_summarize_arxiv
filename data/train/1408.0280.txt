    "conventional pet scanners use expensive scintillators for detecting photon pairs with very high efficiency and excellent energy resolution . however , the process of detecting scintillation light using pmt and associated electronics for charge integration circuits results in a large dead time .",
    "in addition to that , the scanners suffer from the limitations of a short field of view ( fov ) [ 15 - 25 cm ] and relatively poorer position resolution . in a time - of - flight ( tof ) pet scanner ,",
    "detectors with very good time resolution when positioned around the object can be used to record the time of arrival of two photons .",
    "the time difference between two photons can be used to locate the point of annihilation .",
    "tof information of the photons when coupled to the conventional pets , improve the image quality significantly .",
    "apart from the limitations of the scintillator - based systems mentioned earlier , high quality scintillators are very expensive and efforts are being made to look for not - so - expensive alternatives .",
    "extremely good time ( 50 ps ) and position ( @xmath0 mm ) resolution make the relatively less expensive mrpc - based tof - pets to be good candidates @xcite . in mrpc - based system",
    ", the location of the origin of photons can be obtained in 3-dimensions .",
    "the detector cell provides the position in transverse plane ( x - y plane ) and the time of arrival on the detector gives the distance in z - direction .",
    "an r&d effort on the feasibility study of mrpc in pet imaging has been initiated at vecc .",
    "small size prototype mrpcs have been built with both bakelite and glass and tested with cosmic rays in streamer and avalanche mode respectively . in this article , some experimental results of a four - gap ( gas gap : 0.6 mm @xmath1 4 ) prototype bakelite mrpc , operated in streamer mode with argon , isobutane and tetrafluroethane ( r-134a ) in the volume ratio of 55/7.5/37.5 and a six - gap ( gas gap : 0.2 mm @xmath1 6 ) prototype glass mrpc operated in avalanche mode with r-134a / isobutane/ sf@xmath2 in 95/4.5/0.5 are reported .",
    "the mrpcs were tested in the same cosmic ray test bench described in ref .",
    "three scintillators , two placed above the mrpc and one below , were been used to construct the cosmic ray telescope . to measure the timing properties of the detectors the triple coincidence of the signals obtained from the three scintillators",
    "was taken as the start signal ( master trigger ) for the time to digital converter ( tdc ) .",
    "the stop signal was taken from a single mrpc strip .",

    "the efficiency gradually increases and reaches the plateau at @xmath095% .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the distribution of the time difference between the master trigger and the signal from one strip of the four gap bakelite mrpc .",
    "the intrinsic time resolution ( @xmath3 ) of the mrpc at 13.5 kv operating voltage appeared to be : 849 @xmath4 17 ps .     +    ) and the average signal arrival time with respect to the master trigger as a function of hv for the four - gap bakelite mrpc.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the average signal arrival time , taken as the mean position of the fitted gaussian peak in the timing spectrum ( such as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) and the time resolution ( @xmath3 ) of the bakelite mrpc as a function of the applied hv are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the time resolution improves and the average signal arrival time decreases with the increase of hv which is common to any gas filled detector .    the timing spectrum for the six - gap glass mrpc is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] where the intrinsic time resolution comes out to be @xmath0  440  ps ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "mrpc - based pet system is potentially an attractive alternative to the scintillator - based system . as an effort to obtain a least expensive pet imaging system capable of filtering the background ,",
    "we have built a 4-gap bakelite - based mrpc giving time resolution of @xmath0 900 ps ( @xmath3 ) and a six - gap glass - based mrpc giving timing resolution of @xmath0  440  ps  ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "decreasing the individual gas gap and increasing the number of gaps the time resolution can be improved .",
    "simulation to optimise the number of gaps and width of individual gap is in progress . for the proper application in pet imaging such a system with relatively lower time resolution can be useful .",
    "this also provides a platform to build a full glass - based high resolution mrpc system for pet imaging .",
