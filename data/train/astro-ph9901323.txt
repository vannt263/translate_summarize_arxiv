    "the study of the shape of the optical / uv continuum of quasars is an essential tool to test the different emission models invoked to explain the observed radiation , and understand their characteristic parameters . whereas the overall quasar spectrum from the infrared to the x - ray has approximately a power - law form , @xmath22 , with spectral index about @xmath23 , in the optical / uv region",
    "there is a bump on top of the power - law continuum known as the big blue bump ( elvis et al .",
    "1987 & sanders et al .",
    "the big blue bump is generally interpreted with a two component model , consisting of the underlying power - law and black - body - like emission from an accretion disc ( hereafter ad ) around a massive black hole ( malkan 1983 , czerny & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "the determination of the shape and strength of the ionizing uv continumm is essential to constrain the accretion disc parameters , for the modelling of the broad line region of quasars , and other aspects such as the determination of the @xmath24-corrections for quasars , which affect the derivation of their luminosity functions .",
    "empirically , the shape of the optical / uv continuum of quasars is generally parameterized by a power law , although this is a local approximation , with the overall shape being more complicated . measurements of the optical / uv continuum shape at fixed rest - frame wavelengths have been obtained by obrien et al .",

    "the spectral index distribution of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars appeared to be similar .",
    "the authors found a small hardening with redshift , with @xmath1 ranging from @xmath27 for @xmath28 to @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and a trend with luminosity at 1450  , in the sense that the more luminous quasars had harder spectra . from a joint regression analysis including spectral index , redshift and luminosity",
    ", the authors concluded that the dominant correlation was between @xmath1 and @xmath19 , and that the trend between @xmath1 and luminosity was due to the correlation of both variables with redshift .",
    "natali et al . (",

    "optical selection bisases are significantly lessened in this sample , allowing for a thorough investigation of the shape of their blue / uv spectrum .",
    "since the b3-vla quasars have been selected at a low frequency , where steep - spectrum , extended emission dominates , the sample minimizes the inclusion of core - dominated quasars , for which an additional component of relativistically beamed optical synchrotron is likely present ( browne & wright 1985 ) .    the analysis of the blue / uv continuum of the b3-vla quasars is based on @xmath0 photometry of around 70 sources , with redshifts in the range 0.42.8 .",

    "this weak trend explains in fact the reverse result , i.e. that the @xmath86 trend in combination with the @xmath88 trend does not cause a @xmath92 trend .",
    "the possible relation between @xmath16 and the blue / uv luminosity was also investigated . in order to construct each composite",

    "-1.5truecm -6.4truecm    wandel & petrosian ( 1988 ) obtained predictions of the expected uv slope versus uv luminosity for various accretion disc models , spanning a range of values for the black hole mass , accretion rate and viscosity parameter .",
    "they found that the effect of a flattening of the spectrum for the more luminous quasars ( or at higher redshifts ) , reported by obrien et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , could be explained as evolution along curves of constant black hole mass , with accretion rate decreasing with time .",
    "the emitted spectrum for these models under the assumption of constant black hole mass is less luminous and more steep in the uv as the accretion rate decreases , and a decrease in accretion rate with time could explain the observed @xmath101 and @xmath86 trends .",
    "our data show the same trend of a flattening of @xmath16 with @xmath19 and @xmath102 , as well as a @xmath101 correlation , therefore the same interpretation could apply .",
    "the diagrams @xmath103 presented by wandel & petrosian ( 1988 ) correspond to a slope in the range @xmath104   and the luminosity at 1450  .",
    "we have represented in these diagrams the average slope for low - redshift and high - redshift quasars ( separation at @xmath105 ) , using the composite with @xmath106 , and the 26001700   slopes listed in table 7 .",
    "the luminosities were obtained transforming the average values at 2400   to 1450  , adopting the measured slopes .",
    "although we use a slope different than that of the models , at least for high redshift quasars the slope does not apperar to change between the two ranges ( fig .",
    "9 ) . a straight line connecting the location of the two subsamples on the @xmath103 plane would run approximately parallel to the curves of constant black hole mass , with @xmath107 increasing in the same direction as the redshift .",
    "therefore our results appear to be consistent with the interpretation outlined above , and the comparison with the models yields a roughly constant black hole mass , in the range @xmath108 , and accretion rates ( in units of the eddington value ) ranging from @xmath109 1 for the quasars with @xmath110 to @xmath109 10 for the quasars with @xmath111 .",

    "the optical completeness of the sample is high and we do not expect important selection effects in the optical that could explain the correlation",
    ". the correlation could be in principle artificially induced by independent evolution of both parameters with redshift .",
    "in fact the quasars with high blue / uv luminosity tend to have large redshifts and those weaker tend to have low redshifts , and a similar behaviour occurs for the radio power .",
    "however , this alternative is ruled out by the redshift distribution on figure 12(a ) , showing that the half subsample with lower redshifts shows a similar @xmath114 trend as the whole sample ( with unrestricted @xmath19 ) .",
    "the correlation is confirmed in the flux - flux plane on figure 12(b ) , with @xmath115 and @xmath116 over two decades in both radio and blue / uv flux .",
    "the most likely origin for the radio - optical correlation is therefore a direct link between the blue / uv emission of the quasar nucleus , related to the accretion process , and the radio synchrotron emission at 408 mhz .",
    "a similar correlation was reported by serjeant et al .",

    "the correlation @xmath114 would then imply that the @xmath88 trend is , at least in part , intrinsic .",
    "if the trend @xmath88 was due only to a selection effect , preventing the detection of low power sources at high @xmath19 , the trend @xmath123 could be also the result of this effect , rather than cosmic evolution . in this case one of the correlations @xmath86 or @xmath122 could be induced by the other , in combination with the @xmath123 trend . according to the models by wandel & petrosian ( 1988 ) , a correlation @xmath124 in the observed sense",

    "<S> we present @xmath0 photometry of a sample of 73 radio quasars , about 80 per cent complete , with redshifts 0.42.8 . from these data </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the rest - frame blue / uv is analysed , using the individual sources as well as through broad - band composite seds . </S>",
    "<S> the seds of the individual sources are generally well fitted with power - laws , with slopes @xmath1 ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> two sources with @xmath3 were excluded from the general study for having very red seds , significantly deviating with respect to the remaining sources . </S>",
    "<S> the composite seds cover the range @xmath413004500   and the only emission feature apparent from the broad - band spectra is the civ@xmath51549 line , in agreement with expectations from line equivalent width measuremets of radio - loud quasars from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the composites in the log@xmath6log@xmath7 plane exhibits a break at around 3000  where the spectrum changes from @xmath8 at @xmath9   to @xmath10 at @xmath11  . </S>",
    "<S> although the broad - band spectral points are expected to include some masked contamination from emission lines / bumps , the break can not be explained by line / bump emission , and most likely reflects an intrinsic trend in the continuum .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuum shape is shown to depend on redshift . </S>",
    "<S> for the quasars with @xmath12 we find @xmath13 and @xmath14 , i.e. a higher steepening . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath15 @xmath16 is more flat , @xmath17 , and there are too few spectral points longward of 3000   to obtain @xmath18 and analyse the presence of the 3000   break . a trend similar to that between @xmath16 and @xmath19 is found between @xmath16 and luminosity at 2400  , @xmath20 , with luminous quasars exhibiting a harder spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the data show an intrinsic correlation between @xmath20 and the radio power at 408 mhz , not related to selection effects or independent cosmic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations @xmath16@xmath19 , @xmath16@xmath20 and @xmath20@xmath19 appear to be consistent with accretion disc models with approximately constant black hole mass and accretion rates decreasing with time . </S>",
    "<S> if the trends @xmath20@xmath19 and @xmath21@xmath19 are predominantly related to a selection bias , rather than cosmic evolution , only one of the correlations @xmath16@xmath20 or @xmath16@xmath19 need to be intrinsic .    </S>",
