    "it is expected that these offsets are within the uncertainties from both stellar parameter determinations and gf - values .",
    "table 5 presents the final average chemical abundances from all stars analyzed in ngc 2420 and their respective standard deviations .",
    "the derived standard deviations in all elements range from 0.02 - 0.05 dex , well within expected uncertainties due to the abundance analysis itself .",
    "the standard deviation values obtained limit any intrinsic abundance differences among this sample of red giants to less than these rather small values : the observed red giants in ngc 2420 are chemically homogeneous to a few hundredths of a dex . using a novel , and very different technique , bovy ( 2016 ) analyzed apogee spectra from 4 open clusters , including ngc 2420 , to constrain abundance spreads in these clusters .",
    "the technique removes t@xmath14 trends in relative flux levels in both observed and simulated spectra and then evaluates the residuals both with , and without , abundance scatter in the simulated spectra .",
    "the distributions of the values of the residuals can be used to provide strong constraints on any underlying abundance variations in the cluster stars .",
    "bovy ( 2016 ) finds quite small upper limits to any abundance variations in all 4 clusters , including ngc 2420 ; values from bovy ( 2016 ) are included in table 5 .",
    "the upper limits set by bovy ( 2016 ) compare well with the limits set by the standard deviations resulting from the classical spectroscopic abundance analysis performed here .",
    "the largest difference between the two techniques for limiting abundance variations is for oxygen , from oh , where here @xmath34 = 0.03 dex , while the limit from bovy ( 2016 ) is 0.06 dex .",
    "the scatter found here is indeed small , given that oh is both sensitive to t@xmath14 and stellar metallicity ( table 4 ) .",
    "since the red giants analyzed here have , except for one star , very similar temperatures and the same metallicity , the small scatter found for oxygen may not be so surprising .",
    "the members of ngc 2420 present a useful combination of stellar mass and metallicity for probing red giant mixing along the rgb . with an estimated turn - off mass of m @xmath0 1.6m@xmath21 and a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = -0.16 , as measured here , the ngc 2420 red giants fall in a mass / metallicity range where the extent and impact of non - standard mixing across the luminosity bump is sensitive to the details of the type of mixing and the input physics used in the modeling , ( e.g. charbonnel & lagarde 2010 ) , lagarde et al .",
    "2012 ) . of the elemental abundances analyzed here ,",
    "it is @xmath4c , @xmath5n , and the minor isotope @xmath38c whose abundances are most sensitive to both standard and non - standard mixing .",
    "eleven of the red giants in our study have effective temperatures that are too hot ( t@xmath14 @xmath0 4700  4800 k ) to easily measure the @xmath38c@xmath32o or @xmath38c@xmath5n lines to strongly constrain values of @xmath4c/@xmath38c , which is one of the most sensitive indicators of extra - mixing .",
    "the value of @xmath4c/@xmath5n , however , can be used to probe extra - mixing , but is not as sensitive .",
    "previous studies using apogee data ( dr12 ) have used the [ c / n ] ratios in order to estimate stellar masses and ages for the apogee sample ( masseron & gilmore 2015 ; ness et al .",
    "2016 and martig et al . 2016 ) .",
    "assuming initial scaled - solar values of [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] for ngc 2420 ( since it is only slightly sub - solar in metallicity , this assumption is a likely good approximation ) , the red giants measured here have slightly lowered mean values of [ @xmath4c / fe ] = -0.06 and elevated values of [ @xmath5n / fe ] = + 0.11 , which are what is expected qualitatively for first dredge - up in low - mass red giants .",
    "the altered @xmath4c and @xmath5n abundances are due to h - burning on the cn - cycle , as predicted by stellar evolution , with the result that the total number of cno nuclei are conserved . neglecting @xmath38c , which is a minor isotope , the approximate conservation of @xmath4c + @xmath5n nuclei can be tested in these red giants , under the assumption that initial abundance ratios were [ c / fe ] = 0.0 and [ n / fe ] = 0.0 .",
    "the ngc 2420 red giants are identified in figure 8 as either rgb or rc stars ( see discussion in section 3 ) , with the error bars equal to the standard deviations of the means from each abundance determination .",
    "the hotter red giants , near the lower rgb and rc , scatter around the c+n curve quite closely : within less than 0.1 dex , which is similar to the expected uncertainties .",
    "these red giants display the signature of the first dredge - up of matter exposed to the cn - cycle .",
    "the coolest red giant analyzed here , 2m07381507 + 2134589 , is offset from the hotter giants , as well as the c+n curve .",
    "this offset ( @xmath00.1 ) is relatively small by typical abundance standards ; however , given the accuracy of the analysis of apogee spectra , it is significantly larger than the abundance uncertainties .",
    "this effect for carbon abundances , as derived from co molecular lines , has been noted in ngc 6791 from apogee spectra ( cunha et al .",
    "2015 ) , with the result that carbon abundances decrease by @xmath00.1 dex from t@xmath14 @xmath0 5000 k to 4000 k. for the discussion here , this red giant is not considered in constraining stellar models from its @xmath4c abundance alone .    in figure 8",
    "the two groups of red giants ( rgb and rc ) do not show obvious differences in their respective c and n abundances .",
    "the mean abundances are @xmath33a(@xmath4c@xmath39)@xmath35 = 8.17 @xmath3 0.03 and @xmath33a(@xmath5n@xmath39)@xmath35 = 7.77 @xmath3 0.03 for the five rgb stars ( we do not include the coolest rgb star ) and the mean values of six rc stars are a(@xmath4c@xmath40 ) = 8.18 @xmath3 0.02 and a(@xmath5n@xmath40 ) = 7.80 @xmath3 0.04 .",
    "the corresponding mean values of @xmath4c/@xmath5n for the rgb and rc stars are , respectively , 2.50 @xmath3 0.29 and 2.36 @xmath3 0.18 .",
    "we note that the rc mean value of c / n is slightly smaller than for the lower rgb stars , which would be in the sense of extra - mixing . however , this difference is not statistically significant or conclusive .",
    "we note , however , that differences for c / n between rc and rgb stars have also been reported by mikolaitis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and drazdauskas et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , who obtain ratios of ( c / n@xmath40 = 1.62 , c / n@xmath39 = 2.04 ) and ( c / n@xmath40 = 1.60 , c / n@xmath39 = 1.74 ) for the open cluster collinder 261 .",

    "the abundances obtained for our sample of red giants in ngc 2420 are in general agreement with what is obtained for field disk stars at the corresponding metallicity of ngc 2420 , although the derived abundances of , for example , mg , ca , ti , v , and co , show some marginal systematic differences when compared to field star results shown in figure 9 ; these fall close to the lower envelope of the elemental distribution obtained in the other studies .",

    "a manual abundance analysis was carried out for the open cluster ngc 2420 using apogee spectra .",
    "twelve red giants ( 6 from the rgb and 6 from the rc ) were included with abundances derived for 16 chemical elements .",
    "a comparison between the manually derived stellar parameters and abundances with those from aspcap found overall good agreement in t@xmath14 and log g , when the aspcap calibrated surface gravities were used .",
    "good agreements ( i.e. , @xmath280.1 dex ) in the chemical abundances were found for many elements , although some exhibit larger offsets between aspcap raw or calibrated abundances when compared to manual values ; the most notable differences are for na , al , v , and to a lesser extent si .    the mean iron abundance and standard deviation of the mean were found to be [ fe / h ] = -0.16 @xmath3 0.04 , which is in good agreement with the recent result from jacobson et al . ( 2011 ) of [ fe / h ] = -0.20 based on optical spectra .",
    "this value for [ fe / h ] is in - line with what would be expected for a cluster 2 kpc farther out from the solar circle given an fe - abundance gradient of @xmath0 -0.03 dex / kpc ( cunha et al .",
    "values of [ x / fe ] for the other elements do not deviate significantly from solar ( not including c and n which are affected by the first dredge - up ) , although [ o / fe ] , [ na / fe ] , and [ al / fe ] are slightly elevated by @xmath0 + 0.1 dex , while [ co / fe ] @xmath0 -0.1 .",
    "we note that the values for [ o / fe ] and [ al / fe ] follow the trends defined by the galactic thin disk stars , while , [ na / fe ] remains somewhat offset from the galactic trend possibly due to systematic differences in the studies .",
    "the ngc 2420 red giants have @xmath4c and @xmath5n abundances that are consistent with first dredge - up , with carbon-12 mildly depleted ( -0.06 dex on average ) and nitrogen-14 slightly elevated ( + 0.11 dex on average ) .",
    "no significant differences in the ratio of @xmath4c/@xmath5n are found between the rgb stars ( below the luminosity bump ) and the rc stars , providing some constraints on extra - mixing mechanisms .",
    "more stringent tests of possible extra - mixing will come with an analysis of @xmath4c/@xmath38c , which is difficult in the apogee spectral window for red giants having effective temperatures that are characteristic of the lower rgb and rc in ngc 2420 .",

    "<S> we find small scatter in the star - to - star abundances in ngc 2420 , with a mean cluster abundance of [ fe / h ] = -0.16 @xmath3 0.04 for the 12 red giants . </S>",
    "<S> the internal abundance dispersion for all elements ( c , n , o , na , mg , al , si , k , ca , ti , v , cr , mn , co and ni ) is also very small ( @xmath00.03 - 0.06 dex ) , indicating a uniform cluster abundance distribution within the uncertainties . </S>",
