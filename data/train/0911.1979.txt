    "triangle ladder diagrams were initially investigated in the momentum space in refs.@xcite .",
    "the result is ud functions . in the momentum space integration",
    "is done over internal momenta that run in loops of the graph .",
    "however , the same diagram can be considered in the position space with integrals taken over coordinates of internal vertices in the graphs @xcite .",
    "the results of the integrations in the position space and in the momentum space are related by fourier transform . in refs . @xcite the position space representation of the ladder diagrams has been investigated and it has been found that the result is the same ud functions .",
    "this means that the fourier transform of the ud function are the same ud functions , and the correspondence is one - to - one , namely the ud function with number @xmath0 transforms to the ud function with number @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these relations follow st identity @xcite - @xcite which was studied for @xmath1 supersymmetric yang - mills theory in refs .",
    "@xcite - @xcite .    in deriving relations of ref.@xcite the dual graphical representation of the four - point ladder diagram in the form of `` diamond '' found in ref.@xcite",
    "has significantly been used as an external input in order to relate half - diamonds to the ud functions @xmath2 in this letter we show how to perform analysis of ref.@xcite starting with the three - point ladder diagrams and transforming them via dual space images to the half - diamonds .",
    "passing several steps in the transformation procedure from the ladder diagrams to the half - diamond diagrams , we obtain the diamond diagrams at an intermediate step .",
    "however , we do not use the known result of refs.@xcite for the diamond diagram . in contrary , that result is reproduced via dual space image of the triangle ladder diagram in the momentum representation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the iterative definition of ud functions",
    "is recalled . in section 3 dual space",
    "is reviewed and dual space representation of momentum triangle ladder diagrams is considered as a particular example . in section 4 conformal substitution",
    "is analysed for the most simple example . in section 5 the conformal substitution in the ladder integrals",
    "is applied to an arbitrary number of rungs . in conclusion",
    "we write the formula for the fourier transform of ud functions that follows the equations derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and discuss its particular features .",
    "in refs . @xcite the definition of the ud functions has been done in the momentum space .",
    "for example , the result for the three - rung diagram presented in fig.([di1 ] ) is a function @xmath3 of three independent lorentz - invariant variables @xmath4 constructed from the external momenta of the diagram which satisfy the conservation law @xmath5 a useful parametrization for them is @xmath6 three four - dimensional vectors @xmath7 are independent @xcite .",
    "a ladder diagram with an arbitrary number of rungs is represented in fig.([di2 ] ) , and the result for @xmath0 rung diagram @xmath8 is expressed in terms of ud function with number @xmath9 all the functions @xmath10 were calculated in refs . @xcite explicitly .    the iterative definition can be seen in fig.([di2 ] ) and is given by the equation @xmath11",
    "in introduction the relation between the position space representation ( p.s.r . ) of some diagram and its momentum space representation ( m.s.r . ) is explained .",
    "in addition to these representations a dual space representation ( d.s.r . ) @xcite exists . the dual space is not a physical space .",
    "however , it is useful mathematical construction that in case of ladder diagrams helps to find the relation between results of calculation in the p.s.r . and in the m.s.r .",
    "for the same ladder graph .    in the d.s.r .",
    "of the integrals in the momentum space momenta that run in loops of any feynman diagram are treated as coordinates of internal vertices of a dual diagram in an auxiliary `` position '' space .",
    "the line that connects two vertices reproduces a propagator in the integrand of the momentum space integral . in the massless case the line which connects any two such vertices represents the inverse square of the interval between these two vertices",
    "this precisely reproduces the massless propagators in the momentum space integrand ( [ iter ] ) .",
    "for example , the dual representation of the momentum integral for the three - rung ladder diagram of fig.([di1 ] ) is depicted in fig.([di3 ] ) .",
    "graphically , the dual space diagram is another schematic representation of the same momentum integral .",
    "after re - parametrization according to eqs.([param ] ) we make a shift of the integration variables @xmath12 of the l.h.s . of fig.([di3 ] ) by the external value @xmath13 as the result of this shift we obtain the r.h.s . of fig.([di4 ] ) .",
    "the new variables of integrations ( after the shift ) @xmath14 are related to the initial variables as @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 the l.h.s . of fig.([di4 ] ) and the r.h.s . of fig.([di4 ] ) are equal , and they are equal to the l.h.s . of fig.([di5 ] ) in which @xmath18 stands for @xmath19 in this notation and in according to the definition of three - rung ud function of fig.([di1 ] ) the result for the diagram of fig.([di5 ] ) should be written as @xmath20 ^ 3 } \\phi^{(3)}\\le \\frac{[23]}{[12]},\\frac{[31]}{[12]}\\ri.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this paper concise notation @xmath21= ( r_n - q)^2 $ ] of ref.@xcite for squares of intervals between two points of four - dimensional space is used",
    ".    however , the diagram of fig.([di5 ] ) in the dual space can be viewed as a diagram in the position space generated for another field theory .",
    "the letters @xmath22 corresponding to the external points of the d.s.r .",
    "can be replaced with the letters @xmath23 corresponding to any three distinct points in the position space .",
    "the important feature of the construction is that in four space - time dimensions the propagator of scalar massless field between two points in the position space is square of the inverse interval between these two points .",
    "this happens in four dimensions only @xcite .",
    "this correspondence allows the interpretation the dual space diagram as a position space diagram with massless scalar propagators .",
    "the concise notation of ref.@xcite for the space - time intervals is used in the rest of the paper , namely @xmath24= ( x_n - x)^2 $ ] and @xmath25= ( x_1 - x_2)^2 , $ ] that is , @xmath18 stands for @xmath26",

    "the creation of a new fourth factor in the denominator of integral with help of jacobian of the conformal substitution is in some sense an opposite trick to the uniqueness method of refs .",
    "the uniqueness method is based on elimination of one of the three factors in the denominator of the unique integral due to the jacobian of the conformal substitution .",
    "that trick of elimination should be done in the euclidean space in order to avoid possible difficulties with the imaginary part of the causal massless propagators .",
    "the euclidean space metrics can be obtained by wick rotation @xcite from minkowski metrics . after the integration according to the uniqueness method the wick rotation can be done back in order to recover the signature of the minkowski metrics .",

    "the same philosophy can be applied to the constructions done in the present paper .",
    "all the formulas and figures should be understood in the euclidean space .",
    "all the transformations with creating and eliminating of a new propagator are done in the euclidean space in analogy with the uniqueness method .",
    "the minkowski metrics signature can be recovered with help of the wick rotation in each of the integrations in the internal vertices of graph .",
    "a small imaginary part should be added to the square of spacetime distances which are parts of the arguments of the ud functions ( the arguments are fractions of the spacetime distances ) in the formulas of the present paper on the r.h.s . of the figures .",
    "for example , fig.([di6 ] ) and fig.([di7 ] ) are related in the euclidean space before the wick rotation due to the conformal substitution .",

    "this imaginary part on the r.h.s . of fig.([di7 ] ) has been evaluated in ref.@xcite via mellin - barnes transformation .",
    "as an example , we consider transformation of the diagram depicted in fig.([di5 ] ) with three points of integration .",

    "we obtain fig.([di13 ] ) from fig.([di12 ] ) .",
