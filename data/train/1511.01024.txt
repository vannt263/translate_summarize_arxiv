    "optical transitions in semiconductor superlattices ( sls ) have received great attention recently .",
    "in contrast to the quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) case of quantum wells ( qws ) , quasi - particles in sls are not fully confined in the growth direction @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , periodicity in the distribution of the materials with different band gaps and elastic constants leads to the formation of minibands in the case of free carriers and excitons @xcite , and the appearance of additional optical and acoustic phonon modes @xcite .",
    "numerous investigations concerning optical observation of excitons and magnetoexcitons ( mes ) in qws ( e.g. see refs . ) and in sls @xcite usually leave aside the questions related to the non - radiative excitonic relaxation . at the same time , non - radiative excitonic transitions such as phonon emission or absorption allow one to probe indirectly the exciton - energy dispersion @xmath3 ( is the exciton wave vector ) . furthermore , studies of these processes may provide the only way of the experimental measurement of the excitonic dispersion .",
    "indeed , such a powerful method as the hot - luminescence technique ( reported for the first time in ref . ) , which was widely used for measurements of the hole band - structure in bulk gaas   @xcite and in gaas / algaas qws @xcite , is inefficient for the study of the excitonic dispersion .",
    "although excited me states were observed in hot magneto - luminescence measurements @xcite , such experiments can hardly reveal any information on the function @xmath3 .",
    "this is because hot - luminescence measurements can only probe excitons in their radiative states , i.e. when @xmath4 is very small , so that @xmath5 .",
    "the theoretical investigations of excitonic dispersion have attracted large efforts ever since gorkov and dzyaloshinskii s work devoted to three - dimensional me  @xcite .",
    "later , 2d me was studied in the paper by lerner and lozovik @xcite and also in the works concerning 2d excitons without magnetic field @xcite .",
    "exciton dispersion relations in sls presenting the dependencies @xmath3 where @xmath6 ( i. e. minibands ) were calculated in ref . .",
    "in parallel , the excitonic binding energy in sls were studied theoretically and experimentally in ref .",
    "( see also refs . ) , and later the binding energies of ground and excited states in sls were calculated in magnetic and electric fields @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that two - dimensionality and strong magnetic fields are the features which usually allow the separation of transverse variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 from the longitudinal one @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) and in addition permit a simplification of the model for valence band due to the removal of degeneracy @xcite .",
    "the present paper is the result of experimental and theoretical studies on the observation of a resonant behaviour in relaxation of mes in type - i gaas / al@xmath11ga@xmath12as sls in a high magnetic field perpendicular to the sl layers . in our experiments we detected only photoluminescence ( pl )",
    "signal from the ground heavy hole exciton state 1shh ( we employ the usual notation for 2d exciton states @xcite ) while the energy of the laser excitation was continuously varied in a range of  80 mev above the 1shh pl peak . at particular magnitudes of magnetic field",
    "we have observed very strong resonant increase of intensity of peaks corresponding to the excited me states in ple spectra .",
    "we interpret this effect as a manifestation of the magneto - phonon resonance when strong relaxation of the excited me state takes place via longitudinal - optic-(lo- ) phonon emission .",
    "this occurs when frequency @xmath13 is equal to an approximate multiple of the excitonic cyclotron frequency @xmath14 ( a similar effect for free electrons in heterojunctions is reported in refs . ) : @xmath15 here @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the reduced excitonic mass for transverse motion in the layer plane . to our best knowledge",
    "this is the first observation of the magneto - phonon resonance for excitons .",
    "the effect has been found only in one sl sample of the investigated series of sl structures . according to our measurements ,",
    "the quantum efficiency of this sample is about two orders of magnitude less than that for the other investigated structures .",
    "this fact allows us to treat the considered phenomenon as a feature of the enhanced relaxation of the excited me states rather than the peculiarity of light absorption .",
    "the observed resonance profiles ( i.e. integrated intensity of enhanced ple peaks as a function of their energy separation @xmath0 from the ground state ) were found to be rather broad ( with half - widths above @xmath18mev ) and have strong maxima at @xmath1 dependent on the quantum numbers of excited me states .",
    "these facts indicate that transitions to the ground me state occur via intermediate non - radiative states of the ground excitonic 1shh band .",
    "the theoretical treatment developed in our report allows us to extract certain information about the exciton energy dependence on  in - plane \" wave - vector component @xmath19 from the experimental data .    after the description of the experimental results in section ii we present the theoretical study of the phenomenon in section iii .",
    "finally , in the discussion of section iv we demonstrate the comparison of the ple data with the theoretical results and present dispersion curves for the  transverse \" 1shh band @xmath20 extracted from our experiment .",
    "samples used in our investigations are molecular beam epitaxy grown type - i gaas / algaas sls .",
    "the structures are not intentionally doped and the flat band regime is realized .",
    "all the samples have @xmath21 nm wide gaas qws , while the width of algaas barrier is varied from sample to sample as @xmath22 nm .",
    "all the sls consist of 20 periods @xmath23 .",
    "the ple experiments were performed in a he cryostat with a superconducting magnet providing a magnetic field up to 23 t normal to the sl layers . a technique based on employing optical fibers",
    "was used for the sample excitation and collection of the ple signal . in the geometry of our experiment the incident laser light propagates in the direction close to the normal to the sls layers . in order to measure the ple spectra we tuned a double 1 m monochromator slightly lower or directly to the ground heavy - hole exciton photoluminescence ( pl ) peak and scanned the excitation energy of the ar@xmath24-pumped ti - sapphire laser .",
    "the main features of the ple spectra remained unchanged when the detection position was moved in the limits of the linewidth around the 1shh pl peak .",
    "ple of two different polarizations , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , was detected by a cooled gaas detector in the photon counting regime .",
    "1 displays typical heavy - hole exciton ple spectra for the sl with @xmath27 nm and @xmath28 nm ( referred to as sample 8/3 below ) recorded in magnetic field applied normal to the sl layers .",
    "we present here the data for @xmath29 polarization only , since the observed behaviour is very similar to that for @xmath30 polarization . at @xmath31",
    "the most pronounced peaks in the spectrum are the direct heavy hole 1shh - exciton ( its position is not clearly resolved in the shown series of spectra because the laser wavelength was scanned from the high energy side of the 1shh line ) , the indirect heavy hole @xmath32(1shh)-exciton at @xmath33ev   @xcite and the light hole 1slh - exciton at @xmath34ev   @xcite .",
    "when @xmath35 is increased to 6 t , new features become clearly resolved in the spectra above the 1slh peak .",
    "energies of these excited states rapidly increase with @xmath35 .",
    "the origin of the new peaks can be revealed with the help of an elaborate theoretical analysis of the magneto - exciton band structure .",
    "however , this task lies beyond the scope of our investigation . in order to understand the nature of the strongest ple peaks we carried out a simplified analysis of ple spectra recorded at high magnetic fields . as a result",
    "it has been found that the peaks plotted in fig .",
    "1 by thick lines correspond to mes formed by electrons and heavy holes from landau levels with equal @xmath36   ( 2shh , 3shh )  @xcite . in what follows",
    "we restrict our investigation to the study of the resonant behaviour of these me states .    as it is seen in fig .",
    "1 , already starting from @xmath35 of several teslas the energies of 2shh and 3shh me peaks increase quasi - linearly with @xmath35 . at @xmath37 t",
    "the intensity of the 2shh me peak is weak . then starting from @xmath38 t the intensity of the 2shh peak grows rapidly , reaching its maximum at @xmath39 t and then decreases more slowly .",
    "a similar resonant behaviour is clearly observed for the 3shh me at @xmath40 t .",
    "similar resonances have been also observed in @xmath30 polarization , however they occur at slightly larger @xmath35 : at @xmath41 t for 2shh and at @xmath42 t for 3shh .    to summarize the ple data of fig . 1 ( and of the similar series for @xmath30 ) the integrated intensities of the 2shh and 3shh",
    "mes are plotted in figs .",
    "2a , b ( black and open squares , respectively ) for both polarizations versus the energy separation @xmath0 between their positions and the location of the 1shh peak .",
    "the energy of 1shh peak is extracted from another series of ple measurements .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 with increasing magnetic field occurs due to the stronger diamagnetic shifts of the excited me peaks with respect to that of the 1shh line ( see insets of figs .",
    "2a , b , where it is seen that @xmath0 changes almost linearly with the magnetic field both for 2shh and 3shh mes ) . figs .",
    "2a , b show that a very strong increase ( by a factor of @xmath43 ) of me peak intensities arises when @xmath44 and @xmath45 mev for the 2shh and 3shh peaks , respectively .",
    "these values are very close to the energy of optical phonons in gaas / algaas   @xcite .",
    "note however that the resonance for the 2shh peak appears at smaller @xmath0 than that for the 3shh peak . at the same time",
    "the resonant enhancement for the 2s@xmath461s transition naturally occurs in stronger magnetic field than the resonance for the 3s@xmath461s one .",
    "the following features of the resonances should be noted as well : ( i ) their decay as a function of @xmath0 is slower than their build - up ; ( ii ) a structure is observed at @xmath47mev for 2shh me and at @xmath48mev for 3shh state .    as it is mentioned above",
    ", the precise comparative experiments showed that sample 8/3 had quantum efficiency @xmath49 about two orders of magnitude lower than those of all other sl samples investigated .",
    "meanwhile , other features characterising the quality of the samples such as",
    "pl linewidths and stokes shifts in ple spectra are very similar for all samples ( 1.5 - 2 mev and 1 - 1.5 mev , respectively ) . moreover ,",
    "the heavy - hole exciton binding energy was found to decrease continuously from the sample with @xmath50 nm to the sample with @xmath51 nm without any peculiarity for the structure with @xmath28 nm  @xcite .",
    "these two facts imply that the band structure of sample 8/3 in the energy range close to the energy of the superlattice ground state is as yet unperturbed .",
    "we can suppose that strong non - radiative recombination channels are most likely due to deep trapping centers , which originate from native lattice defects @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of non - radiative centers which is caused by growth procedure details of a particular sample plays no significant role in our study .",
    "closing this section we would like to note that the intensity of ple peaks would reflect the absorption efficiency only in the case of @xmath52 .",
    "this condition together with the condition of carriers radiative lifetime being long compared with their relaxation time would permit the excited mes to relax into the me ground state without scattering into other states which relax later non - radiatively .",
    "on the other hand , in our case of @xmath53 the intensity of some peaks can be resonantly enhanced by the mechanism which strongly reduces the relaxation time of the me transition from the excited state to the radiative ground state and hence decreases to some extent the probability of non - radiative me escape .",
    "first note that both states , namely initial @xmath54 , which is 2shh or 3shh , and final @xmath551shh have very small exciton wave - vectors , since @xmath54 arises by virtue of direct light absorption , whereas @xmath56-relaxation directly provides the optical ple signal .",
    "more accurately if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the transverse and longitudinal components , then for these states we find for the used experimental geometry that @xmath59 here the right sides are determined by the homogeneity breakdown due to impurities or by momenta of absorbed and emitted photons .",
    "meanwhile the actual extent of the exciton wave functions is of the order of @xmath60 nm , since , it is determined by three values : the magnetic length @xmath61 , the effective exciton bohr radius @xmath62 , and the period @xmath63 . in the scale of inverse lengths",
    "this reads @xmath64 the significant difference between the values ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) allows one to conclude that the considered resonant transition @xmath65 is indirect one . indeed ,",
    "due to momentum conservation , in a direct transition the emitted optical phonon would have a negligibly small wave - vector ( 3.1 ) . as a result the macroscopic lo polarization field applied to me",
    "may be considered to be homogeneous , and in the limit @xmath66 the corresponding transition matrix element would be simply proportional to @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 being the difference between electron and hole positions ) , which turns out to be equal to zero because of the identical symmetry of the initial and final states with respect to inversion .",
    "thus we consider the lo transition not right into @xmath69 but initially into @xmath70 which is a 1shh exciton state with the wave vector @xmath71 . finally , the transition @xmath72 is a non - radiative process , e.g. provided by acoustic phonon emission .",
    "the assumed transitions are schematically demonstrated in fig .",
    "the transitions resulting in non - radiative exciton relaxation are also shown in this diagram .",
    "one can see that in the assumed scheme the ple signal is proportional to the rate of the allowed lo phonon emission .    among the others",
    "the diagram reflects one essential simplification used in our calculations presented below : we ignore the broadening of the exciton peaks , which naturally occurs due to crystal and sl imperfections ( the curves in fig .",
    "3 have zero widths ) .",
    "the diagram implies that @xmath73 should be larger than @xmath74 .",
    "however , in the experiment the beginning of the enhanced relaxation for 2s - exciton occurs even at @xmath75mev ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which is lower than the lo phonon energy in a bulk gaas crystal @xmath76mev . here",
    "we should note that the value of @xmath0 ( extracted from ple spectra ) corresponds to the separation of the excited and ground state exciton absorption maxima .",
    "meanwhile the density of states in the vicinity of the ground state is presented by a rather wide band , and at low temperatures the emission comes mostly from the lower states .",
    "this fact provides an effective stokes shift ; so that the resonant enhancement of the ground - state luminescence due to lo - phonon mediated relaxation may start at @xmath77 , where the pl linewidth @xmath78mev and the stokes shift @xmath79mev . both values @xmath80 and @xmath81 are determined by disorder effects .    in order to describe the data presented in fig . 2 in the approximation of zero exciton - level width we have to employ an effective energy of lo - phonon which is lower than the tabulated bulk value .",
    "as it was described above this disagreement can be easily eliminated by the consideration of the finite exciton peak widths . however , for the simplicity of the model this procedure is omitted in our calculations .",
    "the deviation of the lo - phonon energy from the bulk value can also be related to an inevitable effective averaging of the sl multi - mode phonon spectrum in the single - mode approach employed in our model . later in sec . iv we will briefly discuss the role of the multi - mode spectrum in the context of the phenomenon studied .",
    "thus our approach should be considered as a theoretical model , which simplifies the analytical calculation of the relaxation rate as follows :    \\i ) results are obtained in the strong magnetic field approximation , which enables to separate the transverse and longitudinal variables .",
    "\\ii ) we consider only the heavy - hole band ignoring its non - parabolicity and the difference in the effective hole masses in gaas and al@xmath11ga@xmath12as layers , though we take into account the anisotropy of effective hole mass .",
    "\\iii ) we also ignore the difference of the effective electron masses in gaas and al@xmath11ga@xmath12as layers .",
    "\\iv ) we consider only one lo - phonon mode with the effective energy @xmath82mev independent of phonon wave - vector direction ( to avoid the possible misunderstandings we replace everywhere below @xmath13 by @xmath83 ) .",
    "besides , as in the case of bulk gaas   @xcite we use only the frhlich - type hamiltonian for electron - lo - phonon as well as for hole - lo - phonon interactions ( c.f . refs . and ) .",
    "\\v ) we ignore possible momentum conservation breakdown and finite widths of the excitonic peaks which occur due to random impurity potential or quantum well and interface roughness .",
    "\\vi ) finally , any spin - orbit terms in the used hamiltonians are disregarded , therefore the presented theory does not take into consideration the effects of  fine structure \" in the ple signal dependent on light polarization ( such effects can be rather peculiar , see e.g. ref . ) .    in spite of these essential assumptions we believe that such a simplified approach accounts for the most important aspects of the transition shown in fig . 3 and yields reliable information about the me relaxation rate .",
    "according to fig .",
    "3 a considerable enhancement takes place when the intermediate state @xmath70 is a real ( not virtual ) state of the lowest excitonic band .",
    "the general formula for the total probability of the lo phonon emission is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the probability of the transition into the state @xmath70 .",
    "meanwhile subsequent processes of relaxation @xmath72 are not the matter of our interest here .    evidently the energy conservation leads to the equations @xmath86 here the intermediate exciton state energy is written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the ground state energy and @xmath3 is the excitonic kinetic energy . the left side in the first eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) depends quasi - linearly on @xmath35 ( c.f . the insets in figs .",
    "2a , b ) because @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , being much less than @xmath91 , is the difference of binding energies in @xmath54 and @xmath69 states .    at the same time",
    "we will see that in strong magnetic field the matrix element for the @xmath92 transition has a rather sharp maximum in the vicinity of @xmath93 , which provides really the resonant dependence of ple signal on the magnetic field .",
    "let us employ the same material parameters as in refs .",
    ", i.e. for the transverse ( in the layer of the well ) and for the longitudinal hole masses we get @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the electron mass is @xmath96 , and the dielectric constant @xmath97 is equal to 12.5 . then the  transverse \" excitonic bohr radius @xmath98 is @xmath99 nm , and for the actual magnetic fields we obtain @xmath100",
    "this fact justifies the employment of the strong magnetic field approximation : @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is the characteristic distance between an electron and a hole in @xmath103-direction ) .",
    "the specific dependence @xmath3 is unknown .",
    "nevertheless , the calculations for  free \" exciton@xcite in a strong magnetic field and for the exciton in sl with @xmath104 and @xmath31   @xcite make it possible to estimate this value and to find that @xmath105 indeed according to ref . the miniband width for a sl with @xmath106 nm is approximately @xmath107mev .",
    "consequently for our sl with the same @xmath108 and with @xmath27 nm the miniband width should be smaller than @xmath109mev   @xcite . in a strong perpendicular magnetic field",
    "this value is to be even more strongly reduced and thus it becomes negligible in comparison with the expected characteristic energy of dependence @xmath110 .",
    "further , the summation in eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) leads to the result which contains the density of allowed states @xmath70 .",

    "moreover , for arbitrary direction the classification of the optical phonon branches as longitudinal and transverse is impossible due to the inhomogeneity of the superlattice medium along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "we choose the simplified model and calculate @xmath113 employing the hamiltonian of exciton - lo - phonon interaction in the following form@xcite : @xmath139 final results include only the squared modulus of the vertex , which is @xmath140 here @xmath141 ( the standard notations@xcite are used ) .",
