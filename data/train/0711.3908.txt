    "as the largest gravitationally bound systems displaying a range of distinct observational phenomena , clusters of galaxies provide information of central importance in cosmology .",
    "total gas and dark matter masses and their profiles provide significant insight into the formation and evolution of clusters and the relationship between baryons and dark matter . it has become increasingly clear that much more can be learned from careful comparisons of cluster observables including galaxy motions , gas properties from x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) measurements , and mass profiles from lensing distortions and multiple images , providing new insight and tighter constraints on the dynamical state of a cluster and the nature of dark matter .",
    "chandra and xmm observatories have provided very detailed information on the physical state of the ubiquitous x - ray emitting plasma found in clusters .",
    "it has become clear that , broadly speaking , there are two classes of clusters , those showing some evidence of interaction , evidenced by complex structures in the gas , and those for which the gas emission is symmetric with a smooth radial variation in temperature and abundance , indicating the gas is probably relaxed and in a hydrostatic equilibrium with the overall gravitational potential . for lensing work",
    "the hst / acs allows the inner caustic structure and central mass distribution to be examined in detail ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2002 ; broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a ; sharon et al .",
    "the wide field imagers such as on the subaru and cfht telescopes permit a statistically significant detection of weak lensing distortion and magnification effects on the background galaxies to be traced out to the outskirts of the cluster ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2004 ; kneib et al .",
    "2005 ; broadhurst et al .",
    "2005b ) .    in the case of interacting clusters",
    "it has proved very interesting to compare their lensing - based mass distribution with their disturbed gas distribution .",
    "clear evidence has emerged in the most favorable case of 1e0657 - 56 ( the `` bullet cluster '' ) that two massive clusters have recently collided in the plane of the sky with a high relative velocity , leaving the gas lying in - between a bimodal distribution of galaxies and dark matter , traced by weak lensing ( markevitch et al.2002 ; clowe , gonzalez & markevitch 2004 ; bradac et al .",
    "this particular case demonstrates that the bulk of the mass is dark and relatively collisionless , as anticipated in cdm dominated cosmogonies ( markevich et al .",
    "2004 , clowe et al .",
    "2006 , milosavljevic et al.2007 , randall et al .",
    "2007 ) , although the estimated relative velocity between the two massive components may be exceptional in the context of @xmath9cdm simulations ( hayashi & white 2006 ) .",
    "other such examples are coming to light , with collisions closer to the line of sight ( czoske et al .",
    "2002 , jee et al .",
    "2007 , dupke et al .  2007 ) . a detailed lensing and x - ray study of a larger sample of interacting clusters by okabe & umetsu ( 2007 ) spans the full range of dynamical interaction , from premergers where the gas is clearly unaffected by the mutual gravitational attraction , to cases where both mass components are still readily distinguishable but the gas heavily disrupted and shock heated , and finally the postmerger phase where the gas shows only local signs of interaction , with a relatively small degree of substructure visible in the dark matter as probed by lensing .",
    "strong lensing based masses of the central regions of massive clusters have often been significantly higher than central masses deduced from x - ray analysis , by factors of @xmath10 ( miralda - escude & babul 1995 , wu & fang 1997 ; allen 1998 , wu et al .",
    "1998 , voigt & fabian 2006 ) .",
    "obvious reasons for the different masses - in addition to modeling and intrinsic observational uncertainties - include possible deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium , sphericity and gas isothermality ( see allen 1998 ) .",
    "lensing estimates are naturally biased upward in the case where the gravitational potential is significantly elliptical with the major axis preferentially aligned towards the observer .",
    "evaluation of this effect in the context of @xmath9cdm simulations shows that the inferred concentration of the cluster profile , measured in terms of the navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , hereafter nfw ) model , can be enhanced by up to 20% by this bias in the worst cases ( hannawi et al .",
    "2005 , oguri et al .",
    "2005 ) , falling well short of the reported discrepancies .    motivated by the need to improve the precision of measurements of gas and dm profiles of clusters , we have begun a program of joint x - ray , strong and weak lensing analyses of several clusters for which we can combine high quality resolved observations .",
    "the advantages of a simultaneous analysis of x - ray and lensing data are clear , given that strong lensing measurements yield the total mass profile in the inner cluster core while x - ray and weak lensing measurements cover a much larger region of the cluster .",
    "the increasing quality and degree of detail of such data allows a more model - independent determination of the relevant profiles along with redundancy so that self - consistency can be checked . under the assumption of spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium the projected temperature and gas density profiles as well as the total surface mass density profile may now be derived directly without resorting to assumed models or simple parameterizations of the profiles .    here",
    "we apply a model independent approach to derive the density profile of a relaxed cluster from a simultaneous fit to both the x - ray and lensing data .",
    "we apply our technique to a1689 ( @xmath11 h@xmath12 mpc ) , a rich and moderately - distant ( @xmath13 ) cluster that has been extensively observed in the optical , near ir and x - ray regions , and is the first cluster in our sample .",
    "the cluster has a cd galaxy whose center is within @xmath14 of the x - ray centroid ; this fact , and the low degree of x - ray ellipticity ( @xmath15 , xue & wu 2002 , hereafter xw02 ) indicate that the cluster is likely to be well relaxed and nearly spherical .",
    "previous estimates of its mass were obtained from the analysis of observed arcs and arclets produced by strong lensing ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a ) , from the distortion of the background galaxy luminosity function and number density ( taylor et al .",
    "1998 , dye et al .",
    "2001 ) , and from weak lensing observations ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005a , b , medezinski et al .  2007 ) . here",
    "we derive the x - ray surface brightness and temperature profiles from an analysis of the full set of chandra observations , which can be compared with a smaller subset of chandra observations analyzed by xw02 , and an independent study based on xmm ( andersson & madejski 2004 ; hereafter am04 ) .",
    "the x - ray and lensing observations and data reduction are described in section  2 , followed by a detailed account of the spectral and spatial data analysis in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we describe the methodology of deriving the gas and mass profiles , and in section  5 we present the results of our deduced gas , total mass , and entropy profiles .",
    "our results are discussed and assessed in section  6 .",
    "a1689 was observed by chandra during three non - consecutive periods .",
    "these observations were made mainly with the onboard advanced ccd imaging spectrometer in @xmath16 imaging array ( acis - i ) mode .",
    "table [ observation time data ] gives a summary of the data we have analyzed including the good time interval ( gti , i.e. , exposure time after all known corrections were applied ) .",
    "we reduced all data using the following release of data reduction software : chandra data analysis software package ciao 3.3 , with the updated complement calibration database caldb 3.2 .",
    "all observations were reduced from the level 1 stage in order to achieve a better modeling of instrument gain and quantum efficiency . the event grades which we used are grade=0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 .",
    "periods of background flaring were removed using the ciao task `` lc_clean '' .",
    "we removed bright sources using the tool `` wavdetec '' with the default parameters : scales=``2.0 4.0 '' and sigthresh = @xmath17 .",
    "results of setting scales=``1.0 2.0 4.0 8.0 16.0 '' were checked for observation i d 540 ; no other bright sources were identified .",
    "we tailored the background files to the corresponding data sets .",
    "identical spatial filters were applied to the sources and the background data sets .",
    "spectra and responses were extracted using the tool `` specextract '' .",
    "all channel count rates were combined into one spectrum ( using the ftool task mathpha , and matching response matrix and ancillary response files , using the tools addrmf and addarf , respectively ) , weighting individual exposures by their respective integration times .",
    "we then binned the combined counts so that there were at least 25 counts per bin .",
    "the center of the cluster was found by iraf to be at @xmath18 , in agreement with the position determined by am04 ( @xmath19 ) ."
