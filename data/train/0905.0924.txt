    "the sizes ( @xmath2 pc ) , velocity dispersions ( @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ) and luminosities ( @xmath5 ) of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies imply that these objects are the most dark - matter dominated galaxies known ( see reviews by mateo 1998 and gilmore et al .",
    "their dynamical mass - to - light ratios are sufficiently large ( @xmath6_{\\odot}$ ] ) that their stars can be treated as test particles tracing their underlying gravitational potentials . dynamical constraints on the dark matter distribution in dsphs",
    "may therefore be compared directly with the predictions from cosmological simulations to study the elusive nature of dark matter ( e.g. gilmore et al . 2007 and",
    "references therein ) .    in the last few years , however , wide - field imaging and multi - object spectroscopic surveys have revealed that dsph stellar components are more complex than previously believed .",
    "localized oddities such as shells ( coleman et al . 2004 , 2005 ; olszewski et al . 2006 ) , butterfly - shaped substructures ( stetson & hesser 1998 ) and cold clumps ( kleyna et al . 2003 , 2004 ; ibata et al .",
    "2006 ) have been reported in several dsphs .",
    "these results conflict with the naive expectation that dsph dark matter haloes ( with typical crossing times of a few hundred myr ) should host well - mixed stellar populations and may pose a challenge to the present cosmological paradigm : cold dark matter ( cdm ) . in a cdm cosmogony , dark matter haloes follow a density profile that is nearly independent of their mass ( navarro , frenk & white 1996 , 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) and scales as @xmath7 in the inner - most regions .",
    "navarro et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have recently shown that @xmath8 varies slightly with halo mass and that dark matter halo profiles only deviate slightly from nfw models ( @xmath9 ) . in such `` cuspy '' potentials",
    ", unbound stellar substructures would dissolve after a few crossing times , as shown by the n - body simulations of kleyna et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who also show that the lifetimes of these substructures would be considerably prolonged if the halo has a constant - density `` core '' .",
    "thus it has been argued that the presence of stellar substructures in dsphs is in apparent contradiction with cdm expectations .",
    "a second oddity in this context is the existence of globular clusters ( gcs ) in dsphs . although gcs are considerably more common in dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. georgiev et al .",
    "2008 ) , at least two of the milky way dsphs  fornax and sagittarius  contain gcs ( five and four , respectively ) . among the milky way",
    "dsphs these galaxies are also the largest and most luminous ( mateo 1998 ) , which may be related to their ability to form gcs at an early epoch . the extended spatial distribution of fornax s gcs ( most lie , in projection , near fornax s half - light radius of @xmath10 pc ) has fueled arguments against cuspy nfw profiles in dsphs .",
    "for example , goerdt et al . ( 2006 ) demonstrate that dynamical friction , proportional in strength to the background density , requires only a few gyr to drag gcs from fornax s half - light radius to its centre in a cuspy potential .",
    "oh , lin & richer ( 2000 ) note a possible solution ; namely , that strong tidal interactions between the milky way and fornax could inject energy into the gc orbits and delay their decay .",
    "however , this scenario is now ruled out by proper motion measurements ( dinescu et al .",
    "2004 ; piatek et al .",
    "2007 ; walker et al . 2008 ) that imply fornax follows a nearly circular orbit around the milky way .",
    "hernandez & gilmore ( 1998 ) , and also more recently goerdt et al . ( 2006 ) and read et al . ( 2006 ) , pose a second viable solution , showing that dynamical friction is suppressed in the inner regions of cored halos , thereby providing a natural explanation for the apparent levity of fornax s gcs .",
    "the survival of gcs in dwarf galaxies may then provide important clues regarding the inner structure of dark matter haloes .    despite recent theoretical efforts to understand the formation mechanism of gcs in a cosmological context ( e.g. prieto & gnedin 2008 , bournaud et al . 2008 ) ,",
    "the formation of gcs in dwarf spheroidals lacks definite theoretical underpinning .",
    "for example , it is unclear whether fornax and sagittarius are the only mw dsphs that satisfy the required conditions to host gcs or whether gcs also formed in smaller and fainter dsphs but did not survive to the present epoch .",
    "the present contribution elaborates on the latter scenario by studying the survival of globular clusters in the tidal field of a typical dwarf galaxy and attempts to address the signatures that the tidal disruption of stellar clusters may have left in the stellar populations of dsphs .",
    "we examine these issues here with the aid of n - body simulations that adopt a cdm - motivated dsph model , where the dwarf galaxy potential is assumed to follow an nfw profile with triaxial shape .",

    "our gc models are n - body realizations of a king ( 1966 ) profile orbiting within a static nfw potential .",
    "the masses of gcs are relatively small in comparison with the host halo mass and here we assume that the presence of globular clusters ( gcs ) does not alter the distribution of dark matter .",

    "( 2006 ) can be safely neglected for this study .",
    "note also that choosing a different combination of axis - ratios will change the phase - space volume occupied by each orbital family ( see e.g. fig .  1 of adams et al .",

    "[ fig : dens ] compares the density profiles of the fornax gcs to those of the nfw halos for the whole range of @xmath23 values estimated for the milky way dsphs by pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2008a ) .",
    "in particular , filled circles show the density profile of the fornax halo .",
    "this figure demonstrates two relevant points .",
    "first , fornax s gcs divide into three categories based on their central densities : ( i ) low - density clusters like f1 , with @xmath45 ; ( ii ) intermediate - density clusters ( f2 ) , @xmath46 and ( iii ) high - density clusters like f3 , f4 and f5 , with @xmath47 . henceforth , to simplify our study",
    "we will consider only the clusters f1 , f2 and f3 to represent the three gc categories .",
    "second , the nfw halos estimated for the mw dsphs display a small scatter in density at small radii ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "varying the peak velocity between 10 and 40 km / s leads to a density variation of a factor @xmath49 at a given radius ( e.g. at 100 pc ) , whereas the stellar densities of the fornax and sagittarius gcs span a factor @xmath50 .",
    "then the domination of dsph gravitational potentials by similar dark matter halos implies that the evolution of gcs depends primarily on the clusters properties at the time of formation , rather than on the properties of their host halos .",
    "for comparison we also plot the density profiles of halos with @xmath51 km / s and 40 km / s , which represent the approximate range of maximum circular velocities of the local group dsphs ( pearrubia et al .",
    "we distinguish three categories of clusters : those with central densities higher ( f3 , f4 and f5 ) , comparable ( f2 ) and lower ( f1 ) than that of the dark matter halo at @xmath52.,width=317 ]    the second parameter relevant to this study is the mass of the gc .",
    "taking into account that all the bright dwarfs in the milky way appear to have dynamical masses close to @xmath53 ( e.g. mateo 1998 ) , gcs represent only a small fraction of the dwarf mass , with mass ratios in the range @xmath54 ( f1 ) and @xmath55 ( f3 ) .",
    "we follow the evolution of the cluster n - body models in the dwarf potential using superbox , a highly efficient particle - mesh gravity code ( see fellhauer et al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "superbox uses a combination of different spatial grids in order to enhance the numerical resolution of the calculation in the regions of interest . in our case",
    ", superbox uses three nested grid zones centered on the highest - density particle cell of the cluster .",
    "this centre is updated at every time step , so that all grids follow the cluster along its orbit .",
    "each grid has @xmath56 cubic cells : ( i ) the inner grid has a spacing of @xmath57 and is meant to resolve the entire globular cluster .",
    "( ii ) the middle grid extends to intermediate distances with a resolution of @xmath58 .",
    "( iii ) the outermost grid extends out to 250 kpc and is meant to follow particles that are stripped from the cluster and subsequently orbit within the main galaxy .",
    "in addition to the overall dsph potential , gcs feel dynamical friction as they orbit within the dsph s extended halo . to describe dynamical friction in aspherical haloes we apply the equations of binney ( 1977 ) , which recover the chandrasekahr ( 1943 ) formula for @xmath59 .",
    "pearrubia , just & kroupa ( 2004 ) test the accuracy of these equations against self - consistent n - body simulations and find that , for a large range of orbital parameters and masses , the overall radial evolution of point - masses within flattened dark matter haloes can be reproduced to within a few percent . as the n - body simulations of pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show , halo asphericity introduces a strong dependence between the orbital decay time and the orientation of the orbit with respect to the halo s plane of symmetry . in particular ,",
    "these authors show that orbits that lie on the major  intermediate axis plane have shorter decay times .    for simplicity",
    "we assume here that the velocity distribution of the dark matter halo is maxwellian and isotropic .",
    "kazantzidis et al . (",
    "2004a ) have examined the inadequacies of the local maxwellian approximation when applied to nfw haloes and , although it may introduce problems to generate haloes in perfect equilibrium , the deviations from gaussianity of the exact distribution function have a negligible impact on the friction term ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . under these approximations",
    ", the friction force per unit mass can be written as ( binney 1977 ) @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the halo velocity dispersion , @xmath62/(1+\\tau)^{5/2}$ ] and @xmath63 is the cluster s bound mass .",
    "pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find that the best fit to self - consistent n - body orbits is obtained for a coulomb logarithm @xmath64 , in good agreement with the recent results of arena & bertin ( 2007 ) .",
    "however , it is well known that this quantity is fairly sensitive to numerical aspects , such as particle number and spatial resolution ( e.g. prugniel & combes 1992 , wahde & donner 1996 ) as well as to the host s density profile ( hashimoto et al .",
    "2003 , just & pearrubia 2005 , read et al .",
    "2006 , arena & bertin 2007 ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to note that the decay times of clusters orbiting in dark matter haloes are uncertain to a significant degree , since orbital decay rates are proportional to the value assumed for @xmath65 .    in order to implement eq .",
    "( [ eq : fric ] ) , we assume that only particles bound to the globular cluster feel dynamical friction , whereas unbound ( stripped ) particles do not . in this way we neglect",
    "effects that the density wake self - gravity may induce on the trajectories of escaping particles .",
    "after calculating the different force terms , superbox solves the equation of motion of each cluster particle @xmath66 where @xmath67 for bound particles and @xmath68 for unbound ones .",
    "superbox uses a leap - frog scheme with a constant time - step to integrate the equations of motion for each particle .",
    "each n - body realization is evolved a hubble time ( @xmath6914 gyr ) in the nfw dwarf potential .",
    "we choose a time step @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the cluster crossing time defined as @xmath72 the crossing times of f1 , f2 and f3 are , respectively , 15.7 , 3.1 and 0.32 myr , spanning a factor @xmath73 .",
    "note that the crossing time of the fornax dwarf is @xmath74 myr assuming a dynamical mass of @xmath75 and @xmath76 pc , illustrating the large range of time - scales that our simulations must cover , since clusters evolve a factor @xmath77@xmath78 faster than the host galaxy . the total number of time - steps required to simulate each of the clusters for a hubble time is therefore large , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the clusters f1 , f2 and f3 , respectively .",
    "we find that our choice of numerical parameters leads to a total energy conservation better than 5% after the cluster models are evolved for a hubble time in isolation , which yields a negligible evolution of the initial model parameters .",
    "superbox is a collision - less n - body code and therefore does not account for a number of internal processes that take place in clusters , such as mass loss due to stellar evolution , core collapse and the subsequent re - expansion due to two - body relaxation processes . whereas the evolution associated with stellar evolution",
    "is significant only during the early life of a cluster ( @xmath82 gyr after formation , baumgardt & makino 2003 ) , two-(and higher order)-body interactions between stars may affect clusters during their entire evolution .",
    "a realistic incorporation of these effects into dynamical simulations has proven to be a theoretical as well as a numerical challenge due to the complexity of the problem and the large range of time - scales involved ( e.g. aarseth & heggie 1998 ) . only in the last few years",
    "has the availability of grape special - purpose supercomputers provided the necessary computational tools to simulate the evolution of gcs with a number of particles @xmath83 ( e.g. baumgardt & makino 2003 ) .    to estimate the importance of two - body relaxation processes in the fornax clusters we calculate first the relaxation time as ( binney & tremaine 2008 , eq .",
    "1.38 ) @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the mean stellar mass in a cluster . a kroupa ( 2001 )",
    "mass function then implies @xmath87 .",
    "two - body interactions increase the strength of dynamical friction . as a result ,",
    "the values of the coulomb logarithm in multi - mass clusters are higher than those found in collision - less systems .",
    "the factor @xmath8 in the coulomb logarithm depends on the mass spectrum and is rather uncertain for clusters . as an additional complication , the mass spectrum changes during the dynamical evolution of a globular cluster ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) .",
    "here we adopt the value found by giersz & heggie ( 1996 ) , @xmath88 . for this choice of parameters",
    ", we estimate that the fornax clusters f1 , f2 and f3 have relaxation times of @xmath89 and 2.2 gyr , respectively .",
    "thus , only f1 has a relaxation time @xmath90 , which suggests that stellar encounters have played only a small role over its lifetime .",
    "fornax s other clusters , however , have likely suffered repeated episodes of core collapse and continuous mass dissolution ( hnon 1960 ) . in practice",
    ", this result implies that their present properties have changed significantly since their formation and can not be extrapolated to several gyr in the past .",
    "two parameters govern the dynamical evolution of a gravitationally bound system within a host galaxy : ( i ) the mean density , which regulates the strength of external tides and ( ii ) the cluster mass , which determines the amount of dynamical friction .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : densmass ] we plot cluster mass against the mean density for the nine gcs of fornax and sagittarius .",
    "the large range of properties exhibited by these clusters suggests that tidal forces and dynamical friction act with different strengths .",

    ", clusters f3 , f4 , f5 and m54 may suffer a strong orbital decay as a result of dynamical friction .",
    "however , since these clusters are considerably more dense than the underlying dark matter halo ( see fig  [ fig : dens ] ) , they should be resilient to tidal mass stripping .     versus stellar mass for the gc population in the fornax ( filled symbols ) and sagittarius ( open symbols ) dsphs .",

    "note that the densest and most massive clusters tend to be located in the inner regions of dwarfs , suggesting that the cluster population may have experienced significant dynamical evolution . also note that the fact that @xmath92 suggests that tidal mass loss no longer affects these systems at their present location.,width=317 ]        despite the fact that the low - mass end of the fornax / sagittarius gc distribution shows a remarkable dispersion in stellar densities ( @xmath93 orders of magnitude ) , no massive , low - density clusters are observed in these dsphs .",
    "the absence of massive , low - density gcs may reflect processes relevant to gc formation or , alternatively , may indicate that such clusters have been disrupted by tides as dynamical friction brought them close to the inner - most regions of their host galaxies .",

    "in fact , since the milky way dwarf spheroidals have peak velocities @xmath102 km / s ( pearrubia et al . 2008a , b ) , our analytical estimates indicate that , if two - body relaxation processes are ignored , the clusters f3 , f4 and f5 would likely survive tidal disruption in any of those galaxies .",

    "as the orbital apocentre increases , the cluster debris extends over larger volumes , leading to a drop in central surface density .",
    "we find that for apocentres @xmath185 and 2.5 kpc , the central surface density of the debris lies in the range @xmath186@xmath187/kpc@xmath1 depending on circularity and orbital orientation .",
    "the maximum surface density ( averaged over circular annuli ) associated with tidal debris from the cluster f1 is @xmath188/kpc@xmath1 .",
    "this value is considerably lower than that of both fornax and carina , which implies that identifying cluster stars from the background stellar population in the central regions of dwarfs will require a sizable data set and additional kinematical information .",
    "in contrast , cluster debris may dominate the overall light distribution at large radii if the progenitor cluster was formed beyond the limiting radius of the host galaxy ( see  [ sec : dynev ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , fig .",
    "[ fig : sbprof ] shows that even in regions with a scarce presence of dwarf stars the detection of cluster debris may be observationally challenging in extended , luminous galaxies like fornax given the depth that the survey should reach , approximately four decades below the central surface density .",
    "finally , a noteworthy remark is that sizable spectroscopic surveys may reveal the presence of cluster debris regardless of the host background surface density if the now - defunct clusters had a chemical abundance pattern different from that of most of the dsph stars .",
    "we shall return to this issue below .          at present , only the sagittarius and fornax dwarfs have associated populations of bound gcs .",
    "an understanding of the formation mechanism of these objects is still lacking , and it is unclear whether other dwarf galaxies may have also formed clusters that were subsequently tidally disrupted .",
    "it is thus interesting to carry out a _ gedankenexperiment _ that explores whether the set of observables in the present dsph population could help us to infer if such disruption events occurred in the past .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the fact that fornax and sagittarius are the most luminous and spatially extended dsphs of the milky way ( mateo 1998 ) may hide possible underlying stellar over - densities with low surface brightness .",
    "[ fig : sbprof ] shows that the potential presence of gc debris would be considerably more straightforward to detect in small , faint dwarf galaxies like carina . according to the estimates of pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2008a ) , fornax and carina are embedded in dark matter halos with similar nfw parameters , despite the fact that fornax is a factor @xmath189 more luminous and has a half - light radius that is around three times larger .",
    "the similarity of their halos implies that , for a given orbit , the cluster f1 would follow practically the same dynamical evolution in both galaxies .",
    "taking the carina dwarf as an example , the tidal disruption of the cluster f1 would be easily detectable at approximately two decades below the central surface brightness as an excess of light beyond the king limiting radius derived from the inner profile . interestingly",
    ", such excesses have been found in several dwarf galaxies ( carina , majewski et al .",
    "2005 ; leo i , sohn et al . 2007 ; sculptor , westfall et al . 2006 ; ursa minor , martnez - delgado et al . 2001 ,",
    "palma et al . 2003 ) , although they have been often interpreted as signatures of a recent tidal interaction with the milky way ( e.g. muoz et al . 2008 and references therein ) . however , pearrubia et al . ( 2008c ) argue that the orbital motion of some of these systems ( e.g. leo i ) is incompatible with the presence of unbound stellar material within the area surveyed by current data , which casts doubts on the tidal origin of the reported _ extra - tidal _ features .",
    "the models presented in the previous sections show that kinematic information may help to identify globular cluster debris . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : morph ] and  [ sec : kine ] , if the cluster s orbital plane is approximately perpendicular to the line - of - sight directions , shells and off - centre clumps with cold projected velocity dispersions would be a clear signature of a cluster merger .",
    "encouragingly , the presence of stellar substructures has been reported in fornax ( coleman et al . 2004 , 2005 ; olszewski et al .",
    "2006 ) , canes venatici ( ibata et al . 2006 , martin et al .",
    "2008 ; also see simon & geha 2007 for a discrepant result ) and sextans ( kleyna et al .",
    "2004 , walker et al .",
    "2006b ) , although some of these detections remain controversial due to their marginal statistical significance .    the presence of an off - centre localized stellar clump , reminiscent of those detected in dwarf elliptical galaxies ( e.g. binggeli et al .",
    "2000 ) , is probably clearest in the ursa minor dwarf ( olszewski & aaronson 1985 ; irwin & hatzidmitriou 1995 ; wyse et al . 2002 ; palma et al .",
    "2003 ) , and has also been confirmed by deep photometric data taken with the wield field planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) on the hst ( battinelli & demers 1999 ) .",
    "this over - density locates 13 ",
    "( @xmath190 core radii ) from the dwarf s centre .",
    "the metalicity of the stellar clump appears indistinguishible from the bulk population of the dwarf ( eskridge & schweitzer 2001 ) , which only contains a single , old stellar population ( e.g. , mateo 1998 ; feltzing , gilmore & wyse 1999 ) .",
    "interestingly , kleyna et al . ( 2003 ) also reported the presence of a _",
    "substructure in umi that locates at a projected distance of 0.23 kpc from the dwarf s centre ( i.e. 1.2 core radii ) and has a very low velocity dispersion , @xmath191 km / s .",
    "the umi substructures detected in photometric and spectroscopic data may correspond to the debris of one or more disrupted stellar clusters .",
    "however , it must be noted that in our triaxial halo models cold features _ always _ show a symmetric pattern with respect to the dwarf centre .",
    "the fact that only _ a single _ kinematically cold substructure has been detected may imply that a significant fraction of tidal debris remain undetected or that the origin of the cold clump is not related to a recent merger event whatsoever .",
    "a third possibility was proposed by keyna et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who showed that dissolved stellar clusters in spherical haloes may retain a coherent and cold spatial distribution for several orbital periods if the halo profile is cored .",
    "the large photometric and spectroscopic studies currently underway will be able to quantify the presence or absence of symmetrically - distributed substructures in umi , and provide a clean distinction between the two possible histories : tidal disruption in a triaxial cusped potential , and quiet evaporation in a cored spherical potential .",
    "projection angles that are strongly misaligned with the normal vector of the orbital plane are more uncongenial to the identification of past mergers and lead to a large variety of possible spatial and kinematical configurations of debris that go beyond the expected `` cold stellar over - densities '' . for example , if the line - of - sight direction lies close the progenitor s orbital plane , the associated debris may show strong velocity dispersion gradients ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sigxz ] ) . also , the tidal debris from a globular cluster that moves on a loop orbit may introduce a rotational velocity component in the stellar population of the dwarf .",
    "as discussed above , a rotation signal may be straightforward to detect in dwarf galaxies , which are prototypical examples of non - rotating , pressure - supported systems , especially at radii where the overall surface brightness is dominated by cluster stars , e.g. @xmath192 kpc in the carina dwarf .",
    "signatures , or hints , of rotation have been reported in kinematic surveys of carina ( muoz et al .",
    "2006 ; walker e tal . 2008 ) , leo i ( mateo et al .",
    "2008 ) , sculptor ( battaglia et al . 2008 ; walker et al . 2008 ) and fornax ( walker et al .",
    "a noteworthy remark is that tidally unbound stars escaping the system through tidal tails would also produce velocity gradients along dsphs similar to those plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] .",
    "also the transverse bulk motion of the dsph galaxy can cause small velocity gradients ( kaplinghat & strigari 2008 ; walker et al .",
    "further data that focus on the rotating stellar component is needed to distinguish between these scenarios .    in this context ,",
    "chemical tagging can possibly provide the most reliable means of shedding light on the nature of the stellar over - densities and kinematic oddities detected in several dsphs .",
    "recent measurements of the chemical abundances of different elements of the fornax globular clusters ( letarte et al .",
    "2006 , mottini & wallerstein 2008 ) reveal a composition that is similar to galactic globular clusters and more metal - poor than that of the fornax field stars .",
    "if the same result can be extrapolated to the globular clusters that may have inhabited other dwarf galaxies , a chemo - dynamical mapping of dwarf galaxies would possibly provide the most efficient method to address the origin of light excesses at large radii .",
    "the results obtained in the previous sections assume a static dsph potential throughout the evolution of our gc models .",
    "although this approximation may be appropriate for isolated dwarf galaxies , it is unlikely to hold in detail for `` subhaloes '' orbiting in the main halo of the milky way .",
    "recently , stoehr et al . (",
    "2002 ) , hayashi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , kazantzidis et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and diemand , kuhlen & madau ( 2007 ) have studied the modifications suffered by nfw haloes undergoing tidal disruption within a more massive system .",
    "a recurrent result is that stripping occurs predominantly in the outer regions of the halo and reduces both @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the reduction in @xmath24 is larger , so that the halo concentration increases . as hayashi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2008b ) show , the variation of both parameters is solely controlled by the amount of dark matter lost to tides . because the stellar components of most milky way dsphs are deeply segregated within the dark matter haloes ( pearrubia et al .",
    "2008a , b ) , dsphs must lose at least 90% of their initial mass before starting to shed their stars .    to illustrate how the stripping of the outer regions of dwarf galaxy haloes may affect existing stellar substructures , we have re - integrated the models shown in previous sections for an additional hubble time in dark matter haloes that have lost respectively 90% and 99% of their initial halo mass . applying the results of pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2008b ) , the halo peak velocity @xmath23 drops to @xmath193 and 0.33 of its initial value and the peak velocity radius @xmath24 becomes a factor 0.37 and 0.14 smaller , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : pot_evol ] shows how the tidal debris of the cluster f1 respond to the potential variation . for illustrative purposes we choose an orbit that leads to the formation of a substantial amount of substructure ( @xmath114 kpc , @xmath194 , orbital plane x - z ) and assume that tidal mass loss does not alter the shape of the halo .",
    "this figure illustrates a few interesting points .",
    "one is that the volume occupied by the cluster tidal debris expands as a result of lowering the potential depth .",
    "this in turn causes an overall decrease of the surface brightness and the prominence of the brightest over - densities wanes as a result .",
    "for example , the two bright clumps visible in the @xmath195 ( upper - right ) panel of the unperturbed model ( @xmath196 ) disappear when the halo loses 90% of its initial mass ( i.e @xmath197 ) .",
    "a similar effect is visible in all line - of - sight directions , which clearly indicates that the amount of stellar substructure decreases if a dwarf galaxy undergoes tidal mass stripping .",
    "in fact , stronger mass loss episodes may erase these stellar over - densities altogether , as the right panels ( @xmath198 ) show .",
    "cluster debris integrated in a halo that has lost 99% of its mass appear basically as a smooth ellipsoid with no obvious substructure visible in any projection angle , despite that the halo potential is indeed triaxial .",
    "finally , another interesting point may be gleaned from the lower panels by noting that the tidal debris become overall `` colder '' .",
    "the strong velocity dispersion gradients that are visible in the unperturbed model ( left panels ) tend to smooth out as kinematically distinct clumps reduce their size ( see bottom - middle panel ) . as in the surface brightness maps , strong episodes of mass loss ( i.e @xmath199 )",
    "erase any previously existing kinematic substructure in the dwarf .",
    "these experiments therefore suggest that dsphs tend to become spatially and kinematically uniform as they lose their outer dark matter halo envelopes to tides .",
    "we have used n - body simulations to study the tidal disruption of globular clusters ( gcs ) in dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) . we assume a cosmologically motivated scenario wherein dsphs are dark - matter dominated systems that follow an nfw profile and have a triaxial shape .",
    "gcs are modelled as n - body realizations of a king ( 1962 ) sphere .",
    "we use the fornax and sagittarius dwarfs , which contain five and four gcs respectively , as testbeds for analyzing the orbital and mass evolution of their gc populations under different orbital configurations .",
    "our findings may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "gcs in dsphs span over three orders of magnitude in density and two orders of magnitude in mass , in contrast with the narrow density range estimated for the inner regions of the dark matter halos in which dwarf spheroidals are embedded .",
    "for example , the value of the halo density measured at @xmath200 pc from the halo centre only varies a factor @xmath201 among all the milky way dwarfs .",
    "this result implies that the dynamical evolution of the fornax clusters can be safely generalised to the rest of dwarf galaxies that contain , or used to contain , globular clusters .",
    "2 .   clusters in dsphs show a remarkable spatial segregation depending on their mass and density , such that the densest and most massive clusters are located at close ( projected ) distances from the dwarf .",
    "this may result from orbital decay induced by dynamical friction .",
    "we show that the most massive clusters in fornax and sagittarius ( @xmath202 ) have central densities ( @xmath203 ) that are orders of magnitude higher than those of the underlying dark matter halos .",
    "our n - body simulations show that these systems will survive tidal disruption in any dwarf galaxy of the milky way .",
    "4 .   in contrast , clusters with masses @xmath204 , like the fornax cluster f1 , are much less dense ( @xmath205 ) and can be fully tidally disrupted if the orbits bring them close to the dwarf centre .",
    "that introduces a large dependence between the cluster s survival time and the orbital type . at a fixed orbital apocentre , we find that _ box , resonant _ and _ loop _ orbits lead to the shortest , intermediate and longest survival times , respectively . 5 .",
    "the tidal disruption of a @xmath178 cluster results in the formation of stellar substructures that have surfaces brightnesses @xmath179 mag / arcsec@xmath1 and very complex spatial morphologies .",
    "depending on the cluster s orbital family and line - of - sight projection , we find that cluster debris may appear as shells , isolated clumps and elongated over - densities . 6 .",
    "the kinematics of the cluster debris are strongly sensitive to the relative orientation between the line - of - sight direction and the cluster s orbital plane . on average , perpendicular and parallel",
    "orientations yield substructures that have , respectively , lower and higher projected velocity dispersions than the field stars of the host dwarf galaxy .",
    "we find that the disruption of gcs moving on loop orbits may introduce a rotational component in dsphs .",
    "our models show that , depending on the orbital apocentre , tidal debris may reach a _ maximum _",
    "mean rotational velocity that is comparable to the peak velocity ( @xmath23 ) of the host galaxy halo .",
    "a crucial remark is that these substructures arise from the potential triaxiality and do _ not _ have a transient nature .",
    "indeed , the presence of distinct stellar substructures in dsphs may be a signature that gravitationally bound systems were accreted in the past .",
    "these substructures , however , may be completely erased if the host dwarf galaxy undergoes strong mass stripping .",
    "although shells , cold stellar clumps and velocity gradients may be an indication of a past gc merger event , in general the detection of the associated debris will be challenging in areas of dsphs where the field stellar population of the host dominates the overall light profile ( see  [ sec : disc ] ) . because dwarf galaxies and gcs have distinct stellar populations , a possible remedy may be found in future chemodynamical surveys involving hundreds of stars .",
    "these data sets will likely shed light on the origin of the stellar substructures and chemodynamically distinct components detected in some milky way dsphs .",

    "<S> we use n - body simulations to study the tidal evolution of globular clusters ( gcs ) in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our models adopt a cosmologically motivated scenario in which the dsph is approximated by a static nfw halo with a triaxial shape . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our models to five gcs spanning three orders of magnitude in stellar density and two in mass , chosen to represent the properties exhibited by the five gcs of the fornax dsph . </S>",
    "<S> we show that only the object representing fornax s least dense gc ( f1 ) can be fully disrupted by fornax s internal tidal field  </S>",
    "<S> the four denser clusters survive even if their orbits decay to the centre of fornax . for a large set of orbits and projection angles we examine the spatial and velocity distribution of stellar debris deposited during the complete disruption of an f1-like gc . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that such debris appears as shells , isolated clumps and elongated over - densities at low surface brightness ( @xmath0 mag / arcsec@xmath1 ) , reminiscent of substructure observed in several mw dsphs . </S>",
    "<S> such features arise from the triaxiality of the galaxy potential and do _ not _ dissolve in time . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics of the debris depends strongly on the progenitor s orbit . </S>",
    "<S> debris associated with box and resonant orbits does not display stream motions and may appear `` colder''/``hotter '' than the dsph s field population if the viewing angle is perpendicular / parallel to progenitor s orbital plane . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , debris associated with loop orbits shows a rotational velocity that may be detectable out to few kpc from the galaxy centre . </S>",
    "<S> chemical tagging that can distinguish gc debris from field stars may reveal whether the merger of gcs contributed to the formation of multiple stellar components observed in dsphs .    </S>",
