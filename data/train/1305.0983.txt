    "electrification of personal transportation is expected to become prevalent in the near future .",
    "for example , from one report of the u.s .",
    "department of energy@xcite , the government sets an ambitious goal to put one million evs on the road by 2015 . besides serving the purpose of transportation , evs",
    "can also be used as distributed electricity generation / storage devices when plugged - in @xcite .",
    "hence , the concept of vehicle - to - grid ( v2 g ) , referring to the integration of evs to the power grid , has received increasing attention @xcite .",
    "frequency regulation service is to balance power generation and load demand in a short time scale , so as to maintain the frequency of a power grid at its nominal value .",
    "traditionally , regulation service is provided by fast responsive generators , which vary their output to alleviate power deficits or surpluses , and is the most expensive ancillary service @xcite .",
    "experiments show that ev s power electronics and battery can well respond to the frequent regulation signals .",
    "thus it is possible to exploit a plugged - in ev as a promising alternative to provide regulation service through charging / discharging , which potentially could reduce the cost of regulation service significantly @xcite .",
    "however , since the regulation service is generally requested on the order of megawatts while the power capacity of an ev is typically @xmath2-@xmath3 kw , it is often necessary for an aggregator to coordinate a large number of evs to provide regulation service @xcite .",
    "in addition , frequent charging / discharging has a detrimental effect on ev s battery life .",
    "thus , it is important to design proper algorithm for regulation allocation in the aggregator - evs system , especially in a real - time fashion .",
    "there is a growing body of recent works on v2 g regulation service .",
    "specific to the aggregator - evs system , which focuses on the interaction between the aggregator and the evs , centralized regulation allocation is studied in @xcite , where the objective is to maximize the profit of the aggregator or the evs . in @xcite , a set of schemes based on different criteria of fairness among the evs are provided . in @xcite ,",
    "the regulation allocation problem is formulated as quadratic programming . in @xcite , considering both regulation service and spinning reserves , the underlying problem is formulated as linear programming . in @xcite , the charging behavior of evs",
    "is also considered , and the underlying problem is then reduced to the control of charging sequence and charging rate of each ev , which is solved by dynamic programming . in @xcite , a real - time regulation control algorithm",
    "is proposed by formulating the problem as a markov decision process , with the action space consisting of charging , discharging , and regulation .",
    "finally , a distributed regulation allocation system is proposed in @xcite using game theory , and a smart pricing policy is developed to incentivize evs .    in addressing the regulation allocation problem , however , these earlier works have omitted to consider some essential characteristics of the aggregator - evs system .",
    "for example , deterministic model is used in @xcite and @xcite , which ignore the uncertainty of the system , e.g. , the uncertainty of the electricity prices .",
    "the dynamics of the regulation signals is not incorporated in @xcite , nor the energy restriction of ev battery is considered .",
    "the self - charging / discharging activities in support of ev s own need are omitted in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the potential cost of using external energy sources for the aggregator to accomplish regulation service is ignored in @xcite , and the cost of ev battery degradation due to frequent charing / discharging in regulation service is not considered in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider all of the above factors in a more complete aggregator - evs system model , and develop a real - time algorithm for the aggregator to fairly allocate the regulation amount among the evs . specifically , considering an aggregator - evs system providing long - term regulation service to a power grid , we aim to maximize the long - term social welfare of the aggregator - evs system , with the constraints on each ev s regulation amount and degradation cost .",
    "to solve such a stochastic optimization problem , we adopt lyapunov optimization technique , which is also used in @xcite for demand side management in smart grid .",
    "we demonstrate how a solution to this maximization can be formulated under a general lyapunov optimization framework @xcite , and propose a real - time allocation strategy specific to the aggregator - evs system .",
    "the proposed welfare - maximizing regulation allocation ( wmra ) algorithm does not rely on any statistical information of the system , and is shown to be asymptotically close to the optimum as ev s battery capacity increases . finally , wmra is compared to a greedy algorithm through simulation and is shown to offer substantial performance gains .    in our preliminary version of this work @xcite , the evs",
    "are ideally assumed to be static , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are in the aggregator - evs system throughout the operational time . in this paper , to more realistically capture the dynamics of the aggregator - evs system , we generalize the system model in @xcite to accommodate dynamic evs , which is considered in none of the previous works@xcite .",
    "this generalization is challenging for the centralized control of regulation allocation , since the returning ev may have a different energy state compared with the last leaving energy state , and this energy difference will impose much more difficulties on the aggregator for handling ev s battery size constraint . to tackle this difficulty , we design a novel virtual queue to track the energy state of each ev . through a careful design of the dynamics of the virtual queue",
    ", we can ensure that the battery size constraint of the ev is always satisfied .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the system model and formulate the regulation allocation problem in section [ sec - sys ] . in section [ sec - wmra ] ,",
    "we propose wmra , and in section [ sec - perform ] we analyze its performance .",

    ", we consider a greedy algorithm which only optimizes the system performance at the current time slot .",
    "the regulation allocation at each time slot is determined by the following optimization problem .",
    "@xmath10 the above problem is a convex optimization problem , and we use the standard solver in matlab to obtain its solution .    in figs .",
    "[ fig - vmax ] and [ fig - smax ] , we compare the performance of wmra with @xmath11 and the performance of the greedy algorithm . from fig .",
    "[ fig - vmax ] , with @xmath12 , wmra is uniformly superior to the greedy algorithm over all time slots , with the advantage about @xmath13 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - smax ] , we set the transition probability @xmath14 to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and vary @xmath17 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the observations are as follows .",
    "first , wmra uniformly outperforms the greedy algorithm over different values of @xmath17 .",
    "second , as @xmath17 increases , the social welfare under wmra slightly rises . this is because increasing @xmath17 effectively increases @xmath21 , which improves the performance of wmra .",
    "this observation is also consistent with the remarks after theorem [ the - iid ] .",
    "in contrast , the greedy algorithm can not benefit from the expanded energy range . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the trends of the curves resemble those for @xmath23 , but the social welfare of both algorithms drops .",
    "this is because when @xmath14 is decreased , roughly speaking , there are fewer evs in the system for the regulation service .",
    "hence , to provide the requested regulation amount , the aggregator more relies on the expensive external energy sources , which leads to a decreased social welfare .",
    ".,width=307,height=268 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig - difv ] , we show the performance of wmra with the value of @xmath1 ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , and compare it with the performance of the greedy algorithm . for wmra , as expected , the social welfare grows with the value of @xmath1 ; also , the growing rate slows down when @xmath1 gets larger .",
    "moreover , we observe that wmra outperforms the greedy algorithm even with @xmath26 .    in lemma [ lem - sbd ] ,",
    "the energy state of each ev is shown to be restricted within @xmath27 $ ] when @xmath28 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig - difvenergy ] , for @xmath1 being @xmath29 , and @xmath25 , we show the evolution of a type i ev s energy state under wmra .",

    "in contrast , when @xmath30 or @xmath25 , the associated energy state can exceed the preferred range from time to time .",
    "furthermore , the larger @xmath1 the more frequently such violation happens .",

    "[ fig - difv ] and [ fig - difvenergy ] demonstrate the significance of @xmath21 in achieving the maximum social welfare under wmra considering the constraint of ev s preferred energy range .",
    "we studied a practical model of a dynamic aggregator - evs system providing regulation service to a power grid .",
    "we formulated the regulation allocation optimization as a long - term time - averaged social welfare maximization problem .",
    "our formulation accounts for random system dynamics , battery constraints , the costs for battery degradation and external energy sources , and especially , the dynamics of evs . adopting a general lyapunov optimization framework",
    ", we developed a real - time wmra algorithm for the aggregator to fairly allocate the regulation amount among evs .",
    "the algorithm does not require any knowledge of the statistics of the system state .",
    "we were able to bound the performance of wmra to that under the optimal solution , and showed that the performance of wmra is asymptotically optimal as evs battery capacities go to infinity .",
    "simulation demonstrated that wmra offers substantial performance gains over a greedy algorithm that maximizes per - slot social welfare objective .",

    "<S> the concept of vehicle - to - grid ( v2 g ) has gained recent interest as more and more electric vehicles ( evs ) are put to use . in this paper , we consider a dynamic aggregator - evs system , where an aggregator centrally coordinates a large number of dynamic evs to provide regulation service . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a welfare - maximizing regulation allocation ( wmra ) algorithm for the aggregator to fairly allocate the regulation amount among the evs . compared with previous works </S>",
    "<S> , wmra accommodates a wide spectrum of vital system characteristics , including dynamics of ev , limited ev battery size , ev battery degradation cost , and the cost of using external energy sources for the aggregator . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm operates in real time and does not require any prior knowledge of the statistical information of the system . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , we demonstrate that wmra is away from the optimum by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a controlling parameter depending on evs battery size . in addition , our simulation results indicate that wmra can substantially outperform a suboptimal greedy algorithm .    </S>",
