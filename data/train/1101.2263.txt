    "in the central regions of galaxies , massive black holes with @xmath5 - @xmath6 ( hereafter , mbhs ) are found to reside .",
    "they are believed to coevolve with their host galaxies , since the masses of mbhs correlate with the mass and velocity dispersion of the spheroidal components of the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "such mbhs seem to acquire most of their masses through gas accretion process in the final evolutionary stage @xcite .",
    "but , the growth from an order of magnitude smaller black holes is still unresolved .    in the last decade , many quasars at redshift @xmath7 have been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that mbhs with @xmath8 have formed when the age of the universe is only @xmath9 gyr . if seed black holes are the remnants of first stars with @xmath10 @xcite , the seed black holes can not grow to @xmath11 with continuous eddington accretion rate over @xmath9 gyr .",
    "one solution is the growth by super - eddington accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , gas accretion onto the seeds should be intermittent , and on average could be lower than the eddington accretion @xcite .",
    "hence , it is worth considering the possibility of black hole mergers for the growth of mbhs . in the cold dark matter",
    "cosmology , a massive galaxy forms through the multiple merger of subgalaxies .",
    "if subgalaxies possess mbhs , a massive galaxy should contain multiple mbhs shortly after the merger . on the other hand , besides some candidates of binary mbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is few evidence for multiple mbhs in a massive galaxy .",
    "thus , multiple mbhs possibly merge into a heavier bh .",
    "but , the merger path of multiple mbhs in a massive galaxy has not been hitherto resolved .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the evolution of the system of multiple mbhs in a massive galaxy .",
    "previous studies found that if two mbhs are in one galaxy , they are hard to merge within a hubble time due to loss cone depletion @xcite .",
    "if three mbhs are in one galaxy , two of them merge or result in a binary , and the other is ejected from the galaxy @xcite . here",
    ", we consider a two - component system that consists of mbhs and stars , where not only three - body interaction of mbhs but also dynamical friction by stars are incorporated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mthd ] , we describe our simulation method to follow the evolution of the multiple mbhs . in section [ sec : rslt ] , simulation results are presented . in section [ sec : dis ] , we discuss the validity of our model . in section [ sec : sum ] , we summarize this paper .",
    "we treat mbhs and stars as a @xmath0-body system .",
    "an individual mbh corresponds to one massive particle , and field stars composing a host galaxy are approximated as super particles , a fraction of which may be interpreted as dark matter .",
    "the field stars are distributed according to the hernquist model @xcite , whose radial mass density distribution , @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 ^ 3},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the total mass and virial radius of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "the virial radius is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath18 is the total energy of the galaxy .",
    "the number of the field stars is @xmath19 .    here",
    ", ten mbhs with equal mass of @xmath20 are set in a galaxy with @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the total mass of the mbhs is @xmath22 % of the galaxy mass and the mass ratio of each mbh to each field star is about @xmath23 .",
    "we perform five simulations with different phase space distributions of the mbhs at the initial time in order to see the dependence on the stellar mass density around the mbhs .",
    "the mbhs are distributed initially within one - third , two - third , and one virial radius of the galaxy in model a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in model a , the positions of mbhs are changed according to three different set of random number , which are labeled by model a@xmath24 , a@xmath25 , and a@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these models are summarized in table [ tab : sum ] .    in the present simulations ,",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath0-body units , @xmath27 . in such units ,",
    "the time unit of simulation , @xmath28 , is comparable to the dynamical time , @xmath29 the light speed is @xmath30 in this units , which means that the three - dimensional velocity dispersion of field stars is @xmath31 km / s at the galaxy center .",
    "if we convert the @xmath0-body units to physical units , the virial radius , the dynamical timescale within the virial radius , @xmath32 , and the average mass density of the galaxy within the virial radius , @xmath33 , are respectively given by @xmath34 } ,   \\label{scaling1}\\\\    t_{\\rm dy }   & \\sim & 6 \\left(\\frac{m}{10^{11}m_{\\odot}}\\right )    \\mbox{[myr ] } ,   \\label{scaling2}\\\\    \\rho_{\\rm v } & \\sim & 1 \\left(\\frac{m}{10^{11}m_{\\odot}}\\right)^{-3 }    \\mbox{[$m_{\\odot}\\mbox{pc}^{-3}$]}. \\label{scaling3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to this scaling , the present results can be applicable for the different mass system , which is discussed later .",
    "we assume that two mbhs merge through gravitational wave radiation , when the separation between two mbhs is less than ten times the sum of their schwarzschild radii : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the position and schwarzschild radius of @xmath38-th mbh .",
    "the schwarzschild radius of @xmath38-th mbh is @xmath39 for the mbh mass @xmath40 .",
    "the equations of motion for field stars and mbhs are respectively given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath36 are the positions of @xmath38-th field star and mbh , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the numbers of field stars and mbhs , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the accelerations of @xmath47-th field star and mbh on @xmath38-th field star , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the accelerations of @xmath47-th field star and mbh on @xmath38-th mbh , respectively . excepting the mbh - mbh interaction , the accelerations are given by newtonian gravity : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are respectively the masses of @xmath47-th field star and mbh , and the softening parameter ( @xmath53 ) is introduced only in star - star interactions .",
    "the acceleration between two mbhs contains newtonian gravity and post - newtonian corrections , such as @xmath54 for the second term ( @xmath55 ) , the pericenter shift ( 1pn and 2pn terms ) as well as the gravitational radiation emission ( 2.5pn term ) is considered @xcite .",
    "we adopt equation ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) in @xcite for the second term .",
    "if the semi - major axis is less than @xmath56 , the motion of the binary is transformed to the motion of the center of mass and the relative motion .",
    "we ignore tidal forces by distant field stars on the binary .",
    "then , the acceleration by a distant field star @xmath57 to the center of mass ( @xmath58 ) and the relative motion ( @xmath59 ) is approximated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the position of the center of mass of the mbh binary .",
    "distant field stars are defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "we use a fourth - order hermite scheme with individual timestep @xcite and block timestep @xcite for field stars , mbhs , and the relative motion in binary mbhs . as for the motion of the center of mass of mbh binaries , a fourth - order hermite ahmad - cohen scheme @xcite",
    "is employed . in an hermite ahmad - cohen scheme , the acceleration due to single mbhs or stars near a binary mbh , and those due to distant stars are calculated on separate timesteps , which we call `` neighbor step '' and `` distant step '' , respectively .",

    "the timestep for the center of mass of a binary mbh is determined as @xmath72},\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the accuracy parameters , and @xmath75 is the acceleration due to post - newtonian corrections for the center of mass of a binary mbh .",
    "the relative error in our simulations is less than @xmath22 % regarding the total energy .",
    "we perform simulations with @xmath76 nodes of the first simulator in university of tsukuba @xcite . at each node ,",
    "the first simulator is equipped with one blade - grape board , which is the accelerator of the gravity calculations for collisional @xmath0-body problem .",
    "the gravity by field stars for a given field star and mbh is calculated in parallel .",
    "we calculate a system of ten mbhs in one galaxy during about @xmath77 @xmath0-body time units , which corresponds to about 800 myr in physical units . we find that several mbhs merge into one for all simulations .",
    "we summarize mbh masses at the final time of simulations in table [ tab : sum ] .",
    "the heaviest mbh has @xmath78 - @xmath79 , while the second heaviest mbh has @xmath80 , except model a@xmath24 .",
    "the growth of such a dominant mbh is weakly dependent on the initial stellar mass density around mbhs .",
    ".summary for our simulation results . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sum ]    we see the process in which only one mbh grows in each simulation , using the result of model a@xmath26 as a typical case . as shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : bbh ] , only one mbh grows , and other mbhs do not grow .",
    "the second and third panels of figure [ fig : bbh ] show that mbhs compose a binary with a semi - major axis less than @xmath81 for a longer time than the dynamical time ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "when a binary merges to form a heavier mbh , a lighter component is often exchanged by a third mbh .",
    "thereafter , a binary mbh forms again , containing the heaviest mbh ( see the fourth panel of figure [ fig : bbh ] ) . this is because a heavier mbh is easier to be retained in a binary mbh through an interaction between the binary mbh and single mbh .",
    "consequently , only one heavy mbh grows in a galaxy .    .",
    "from top to bottom , the panels show the mass of the heaviest mbh and second heaviest at each time , the semi - major axis , the distance at the pericenter , and the masses of two mbhs when a binary forms , and the number of binary mbhs . as for the number of binary mbhs",
    ", we only count binary mbhs whose semi - major axes are less than @xmath83 .",
    "pairs of integers in the second panel show the labels of mbhs composing the binary mbhs , where the heaviest mbh is labeled with `` @xmath84 '' .",
    "we attached labels only to binary mbhs which are long - lived , or merge eventually . in the second top and middle panels ,",
    "filled circles indicate the moments when mbhs merge and crosses denote those when binary components are exchanged . ]",
    "the reason why no other mbhs merge is understood as follows . when a binary mbh forms in a galaxy , the binary prevents the formation of another binary mbh , because the preformed binary mbh gives other mbhs kick velocities .",
    "since mbhs can not merge without forming a binary mbh , no other mbhs can merge .    in model a@xmath24 , the first binary forms just temporarily .",
    "it is ejected with a speed of more than @xmath85 km / s due to the back reaction of sling - shot mechanism , when the binary with masses of @xmath86 and @xmath87 merges through the sling - shot mechanism of an interaction mbh .",
    "after the ejection , the second binary forms and merge to produce the mbh with mass of @xmath88 through the same process as described above . in our simulations , the ejection by the sling - shot interaction is observed only once . in all the simulations ,",
    "the merger of binary mbhs occurs @xmath89 times in total .",
    "hence , the ejection of the heaviest mbh due to the sling - shot seems rare .      for the mergers of the mbhs , the dynamical friction plays a key role . in figure",
    "[ fig : friction ] , the time variation of the distance of the third nearest mbh from the galactic center is shown , where the result in the @xmath0-body simulation and that in a fixed potential of the hernquist model are compared . in the fixed potential , no dynamical friction is exerted . as seen in this figure",
    ", the dynamical friction by field stars in the @xmath0-body simulation allows the mbhs to gather near the galaxy center .",
    "thus , two mbhs can compose a binary mbh , and subsequently another mbh can intrude the binary mbh .",
    "in contrast , in a fixed potential , even a binary mbh can not be formed , since they can not gather at around the galaxy center .     and that in a fixed potential are compared . ]    here we see the details of the merger mechanism of binary mbhs . in figure [ fig:3body - gw ] ,",
    "the processes of the second merger of mbhs are shown in models a@xmath25 and a@xmath26 .",
    "the second merger in model a@xmath25 is the simplest case .",
    "the binary mbh and a single mbh approaches to each other , and strongly interact .",
    "consequently , the distance of the binary mbh at the pericenter shrinks , followed by emitting gravitational wave radiation and merger . in practice , another single mbh often intrudes into the binary mbh whose orbit is being decayed due to energy loss through gravitational wave radiation , and subsequently the semi - major axis and eccentricity of the binary mbh are changed , as seen in the middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig:3body - gw ] .",
    "however , the crucial impact is brought by one strong interaction . in our five simulations",
    ", there does not occur the simultaneous interaction of multiple mbhs that triggers the merger of a mbh binary .    , and the distance at the pericenter of binary mbhs , @xmath90 , just before the second mergers in models a@xmath25 ( top ) and a@xmath26 ( middle and bottom ) .",
    "also , the separation between the center of mass of the binary mbhs and single mbhs which interact strongly with the binary mbhs is shown by dashed and dotted curves ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ) , where the numbers attached to @xmath95 are the labels of mbhs .",
    "the bottom panel demonstrates the exchange interaction that one binary component is replaced by another single mbh . ]    also , we have not observed the secular angular momentum loss of a binary mbh through the kozai mechanism @xcite .",
    "the kozai mechanism can occur , only if the internal orbit of the binary mbh is closed in every binary period .",
    "however , the internal orbit is not closed due to the relativistic pericenter shift ( 1pn and 2pn ) @xcite .",
    "actually , we have found that the kozai mechanism works for a binary to merge only if we do not include the 1pn and 2pn terms .",
    "the suppression of the kozai mechanism is also demonstrated in the case of stellar - sized black holes @xcite and in the planetary orbits @xcite .",
    "the present simulations have the scalings shown in equations ( [ scaling1 ] ) , ( [ scaling2 ] ) , and ( [ scaling3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the present results are applicable for the different mass scales of a host galaxy and mbhs , if the density of the host galaxy satisfies the scaling . for instance , if the collapse redshift of a host galaxy is shifted from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , the virial density of the host galaxy is expected to be increased by a factor of @xmath98 .",
    "hence , the same merger processes of mbhs are expected for a host galaxy with @xmath99 and mbhs with equal mass of @xmath100 .    in the present model ,",
    "the host galaxy is assumed to have a spherical hernquist profile .",
    "mbhs ejected from the center on a nearly radial orbit with speed below that of escape speed repeatedly return to the center in our spherical model",
    ". however , these mbhs do not contribute much to the merger of binary mbhs .",
    "we have found that there is no time for such mbhs to interact with binary mbhs , since they pass the center with high speed .",
    "mbhs which gather towards the galactic center by the dynamical friction more effectively contribute to the merger of a binary mbh .",
    "we have ignored the recoil by gravitational wave . unless black hole spins are aligned",
    ", the recoil velocity can reach up to @xmath101 km / s @xcite .",
    "such a large recoil velocity can eject the merger remnant from the galaxy . however ,",
    "if their spins are aligned before their merger due to relativistic spin precession @xcite , then the recoil velocity decreases to a few @xmath102 km / s .",
    "if the recoil velocity is a few @xmath102km / s , the merger remnant is possibly confined in a host galaxy with the velocity dispersion of @xmath31 km / s .",
    "then , the recoil may not the results dramatically .",
    "nonetheless , it seems worth exploring carefully the effects of recoil , which will be considered in the future analysis .",
    "we have assumed that a binary mbh immediately merges at the moment when their separation become smaller than ten times the sum of their schwarzschild radii . in practice ,",
    "a binary mbhs take a bit more time to merge .",
    "but , the timescale is too short , the merger to be disturbed by the intrusion of another mbh .",
    "the merging timescale of a binary mbh is @xmath103 in @xmath0-body units , while it interacts with a mbh once a dynamical time of the galaxy , @xmath104 in @xmath0-body units .",
    "actually , as seen in figure [ fig:3body - gw ] , any mbh does not approach to the binary mbhs after the semi - major axis becomes about @xmath105 length unit .",
    "we have performed highly - accurate @xmath0-body simulations to explore the evolution of multiple mbhs in one galaxy . here , ten mbhs with equal mass of @xmath20 are set in a galaxy with @xmath21 . as a result",
    ", it is found that @xmath3 - @xmath4 mbhs successively merge , resulting in a single heavier mbh within 1 gyr .",
    "the growth timescale is shorter than a hubble time at redshift @xmath106 .",
    "after @xmath3 - @xmath4 mbhs merge , the other mbhs in the galaxy have the same masses as those at the initial time .",
    "the key physics for the successive merger is the dynamical friction that allows the formation of binary mbhs and frequent interactions of single mbhs with the binary mbhs at the galactic center .",
    "hence , the key parameter for the mbh merger is the density of field stars in the regions where mbhs are distributed .",
    "the distance of a mbh binary at the pericenter shrinks through the sling - shot mechanism of another mbh .",
    "it followed by the shrink of the semi - major axis due to the energy loss by gravitational wave radiation , and eventually the binary merges .",
    "we have found that the secular angular momentum loss by the kozai mechanism does not work for a binary to merge if the relativistic periastron shift is properly included .",
    "the present simulations imply that a large mbh can be formed from the system of multiple mbhs with smaller mass purely through @xmath0-body process .",
    "the present results are applicable for the different mass scales of a host galaxy and mbhs , if the density of the host galaxy satisfies the scaling in the @xmath0-body units",
    ". this merger path can be important for the growth of mbhs in a primordial galaxy .",
    "also , the mbh merger may be a potential source of gravitational waves for the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) and pulsar timing .",
    "we thank toshiyuki fukushige for helpful advice on parallel @xmath0-body code , takashi okamoto for fruitful discussion on initial conditions , masaki iwasawa for useful comments about our simulation method , and anonymous referee for meaningful advice on post - newtonian approximation .",
