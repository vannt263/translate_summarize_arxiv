    "ngc  3311 in the hydra cluster ( nicmos program 7820 , d. geisler et al . ) was added to the intermediate - distance set , although it does not have an @xmath1-band sbf distance measurement .",
    "the main focus of this study is to measure distances to the set of 16 galaxies ( including the six intermediate - distance galaxies ) that extend out to redshifts of 10,000 kms@xmath0 .",
    "the most distant galaxies are uniformly distributed on the sky to provide a robust determination of @xmath2  and minimize sensitivity to bulk streaming motions in the local universe . the sample and observational data are presented in table [ sampletable ] ; the positions of the galaxies on the sky are shown in figure  [ supergal ] in galactic coordinates .",
    "the results presented in this paper are derived from data taken as part of six separate nicmos programs . in some cases",
    "the observers in these other programs were careful to ensure that their data would be useful for sbf measurements .",
    "this program demonstrates the value of the hst archive .",
    "all the data were acquired using the background - minimizing f160w filter ( 1.6 , similar to the standard @xmath11 filter ) and the nic2 camera read out in the multiaccum mode .",
    "nic2 has a plate scale of 0.075 arcsec per pixel which gives a field of view 19.2 arcsec across .",
    "data were reduced using modified versions of idl routines developed by the nicmos team . during each exposure , the nic2 array was read non - destructively several times , and intermediate images from the multiaccum sequence were created by subtracting the initial read from the intermediate reads . a dark current image from the nicmos team s library",
    "was then subtracted and pixels exhibiting non - linear response were identified . the differences between intermediate reads were used to identify pixels affected by cosmic rays , which were recognizable as a change in the rate of accumulation of flux in a pixel and could be corrected using the unaffected sub - images .",
    "remaining cosmic rays were fixed when the individual multiaccum images were combined . the next step was to construct the full exposure by multiplying the fitted slope of flux accumulation in each pixel by the total exposure time , divide by the flat field , and mask bad pixels .",
    "the combined multiaccum images were then registered to the nearest pixel and added together ; integer - pixel registration does not introduce correlations in the noise between pixels that change the spatial power spectrum of the noise .",
    "the sbf analysis assumes that the noise is uncorrelated between pixels .",
    "raw nicmos images frequently have slightly different bias levels in each quadrant . in the final coadded images ,",
    "the background level mismatches between quadrants produce horizontal and vertical discontinuities that affect the measurement of the sbf spatial power spectrum . to remove the offsets , we first processed each individual image and subtracted a smooth fit to the galaxy .",
    "the differences between residual background levels in narrow regions on either side of the boundaries were measured .",
    "overall offsets were then computed to effectively add zero flux to the overall image background while minimizing the differences across boundaries .",
    "offsets were applied to the images prior to dividing by the flat field .",
    "the final coadded images are much smoother and do not suffer from discontinuities in the background .    once the relative bias levels between quadrants was removed , the overall bias level remained uncertain .",
    "any such background not removed prior to dividing by the flat field image carries the power spectrum of the flat field into the final spatial power spectrum .",
    "the nic2 flat field has significant structure , making it necessary to address the possibility that residual bias adds power to the measured sbf power spectrum . to measure the influence of residual bias levels on the sbf measurement",
    ", we constructed an image composed of scaled copies of that flat field added with the offsets of the dither pattern .",
    "the resulting image was then scaled to form a `` residual bias image '' and added to or subtracted from the final galaxy image prior to sbf analysis .",
    "the sbf analysis was repeated for different scale factors , corresponding to the likely range of residual bias values .",
    "the most likely residual bias level was determined by trial and error : if a residual bias correction was similar to the level of the inter - quadrant bias adjustment , resulted in lower fluctuation amplitudes , and made the fit to the power spectrum better over a larger range of wavenumber , then it was adopted .",
    "if adding a scaled residual bias image led to a worse fit to the spatial power spectrum , or increased the fluctuation amplitude , then no correction was adopted . in many cases applying a residual bias correction",
    "did not make the power spectrum fit better or worse , and no correction was adopted .",
    "the influence of residual bias on the final sbf measurement was included in the uncertainty by noting the change in the fluctuation magnitude resulting from a range of applied residual bias levels .",
    "some raw nic2 images were also affected by interference from the operation of the other cameras . because nic1 and nic3 were not operated in precisely the same mode as nic2 , the cameras were not being reset and read at the same time .",
    "interference between cameras resulted in dark and light horizontal lines in the raw images that adversely affect the sbf power spectrum . to remove the lines , we first identified the affected rows in each individual image with a smooth galaxy profile removed .",
    "these rows were masked before the final image was constructed .",
    "a few cosmic rays were energetic enough to leave a residual ghost that persisted for several minutes in the subsequent multiaccum sequences .",
    "we identified these occasional residual cosmic rays and masked them as well .",
    "these , along with any cosmic rays that escaped detection in the multiaccum sequence , were fixed using valid data for the same location on the sky from the other images in the dither sequence .",
    "each individual exposure ( a complete multiaccum sequence ) was dithered by 1.5 arcsec , or 20 pixels .",
    "when the final summed images were created , we also used the spatial information in the dither sequence to fix the lines caused by read out interference .",
    "the final images are smooth and clean , free from almost all the defects inherent in the raw images .    even when great care was taken to remove cosmic rays and detector artifacts , one type of persistent problem proved to be difficult to remove from our data .",
    "when the hst passed through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the nicmos arrays were completely saturated with cosmic rays .",
    "the arrays were turned off during these passages .",
    "however , some of the time the arrays were restarted too soon after passage through the saa , and the number of hard cosmic ray hits was very high .",
    "the persistent images from these cosmic rays are obvious in the first multiaccum sequences taken after passing through the saa , and slowly decay through several subsequent exposures .",
    "the background of residual cosmic rays is best described as a `` wormy '' pattern , with small , sometimes elongated patches of several pixels having significantly higher signal than surrounding regions .",
    "an example of this wormy background is shown for one quadrant in subsequent multiaccum images in figure [ worms ] , in which the galaxy profile has been subtracted to show the background .",
    "the `` worms '' make up the splotchy background ( left panel ) and are distributed fairly uniformly over the array because they correspond to the locations of cosmic ray hits .",
    "worms are a serious concern for sbf measurements , as they are not confined to a small number of pixels . their spatial power spectrum ,",
    "while not exactly matching the psf power spectrum , has significant power on the spatial scales used to fit the sbf power spectrum .",
    "if not removed , the power in worms can dominate the stellar fluctuations .",
    "the low level persistence of the wormy background pattern can bias the sbf measurement because worms add power to the fluctuation power spectrum , even when they are no longer obvious in the images .    to deal with the worms , we started by examining the galaxy - subtracted residual images from individual multiaccum sequences ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ worms ] ) and we excluded the badly affected images . the remaining question , then , is to what extent the rest of the images were affected .",
    "the power spectra from sequential exposures showed the total power decaying to an asymptotic value , although it was difficult to know if the contribution from worms at the asymptotic power level was zero or not .",
    "because the worms were not convolved with the psf , it was sometimes possible to identify wormy images from power spectra that deviated systematically from the psf power spectrum .",
    "a wormy image has more power at high wavenumbers ( small scales ) and less power at low wavenumbers than the psf . to estimate the maximum contribution from residual worminess",
    ", we examined the behavior of the sbf signal as a function of the distance from the center of the galaxy .",
    "the stellar sbf signal scales with the galaxy surface brightness , while any background fluctuation power from cosmic ray image persistence is uniform .",
    "the result of background worminess was a fluctuation power that increased with the area of the region being analyzed .",
    "we measured the sbf power in three or four apertures centered on the galaxy nucleus , and , assuming the stellar population of the galaxy is reasonably uniform ( ie . , the intrinsic stellar fluctuation magnitude does not change drastically with radius ) , we applied a correction proportional to area to make the fluctuation measurements in the different annuli equal , if possible .",
    "the details of these corrections are discussed further in the appendix .",
    "we followed the same basic procedures for measuring sbf amplitudes outlined in detail in jensen et al .",
    "we first fitted and subtracted a smooth fit to the galaxy profile .",
    "fluctuations can be seen in the three examples shown in figure  [ images ] .",
    "objects in the galaxy - subtracted image were identified , their brightnesses and number densities measured , and a luminosity function generated for globular clusters ( gcs ) and background galaxies ( see jensen et al .",
    "1998 for details of the luminosity function fits ) .",
    "objects down to the completeness limit were masked , and the luminosity function integrated beyond the completeness limit to determine the contribution to the sbfs from undetected globular clusters and galaxies .",
    "the sbf analysis is insensitive to the exact values assumed for the globular cluster luminosity function width and peak magnitude or the galaxy luminosity function slope when the brightest of these populations are well - measured and masked .",
    "residual large - scale variations in the background resulting from incomplete galaxy subtraction were fitted and removed as well ; low wavenumbers ( @xmath12 ) were ignored in fitting the power spectrum because the spectrum at low wavenumbers was modified by the background subtraction .",
    "the fitting parameters for the galaxy profile and large - scale background were tuned to produce the cleanest power spectrum possible .",
    "the uncertainties resulting from the galaxy and background fits were determined and added in quadrature with the other sources of uncertainty .",
    "dusty regions near the centers of a few of the galaxies were masked .",
    "the sbf spatial power spectrum normalized by the mean galaxy surface brightness was fitted with the sum of a white - noise component @xmath13 and the expectation power spectrum @xmath14 scaled by the fluctuation power @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath14 is a combination of the normalized psf power spectrum and the mask used to excise point sources and select the radial region of the galaxy being analyzed .",
    "the data were fitted with the function @xmath16    the fluctuation power @xmath15 must be corrected for undetected point sources and residual wormy background .",
    "these are represented by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the power in stellar sbfs is therefore @xmath19 @xmath20 is simply a flux , and has units of electrons per pixel per integration time .",

    "is it possible that @xmath2@xmath239 kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0 , and that we have overestimated it by 15% ( or more ) ?",
    "roughly one third of this difference disappears if the zehavi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) hubble bubble model is correct .",
    "if galaxies nearer than @xmath231 kms@xmath0   must be disregarded because of their enhanced velocities away from a locally under - dense region , then our measurement of @xmath2  can be as low as 72 kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0 .",
    "our results do not demand that this be the case , however , and are still consistent with observations that refute the hubble bubble hypothesis ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1999 , lahav 2000 ) .",
    "the fits including all the data , assuming a smooth hubble flow , are equally good because the nearer meausurements tend to be most reliable .",
    "extinction from clumpy dust in the individual galaxies could add to the fluctuation power and bias the sbf measurements to shorter distances .",
    "no sign of dust was seen in the images of the galaxies used to determine the calibration of @xmath47  ( aside from ngc  1387 and ngc  4536 , which were excluded ) .",
    "six of the distant galaxies do have obvious dust lanes ( table  [ powertable ] ) .",

    "there is no evidence for extended patches of dust with sizes comparable to the psf and smooth on larger scales .",
    "the distances for these are not systematically smaller than the others at the same redshifts , nor are their colors redder on average .",
    "the hubble constant measured with the six dusty galaxies excluded was not significantly smaller , and it seems unlikely that all the distant galaxies would have uniformly distributed clumpy dust that would be unrecognizable in our images .    besides the potential 6% reduction in @xmath2  beyond @xmath240 mpc suggested by the six most distant measurements , are there systematic problems with the f160w sbf measurements that could explain another @xmath24110% ( or more ) difference between our results and the conclusions of the supernovae measurements ? there are potentially three sources of extra power in the power spectrum that are not convolved with the diffraction pattern of the telescope , but do have power on the spatial scales over which we fit the sbf power spectrum .",
    "the first of these is the residual bias scaled by the flat field image .",
    "we addressed this possibility by explicitly subtracting a dithered bias@xmath242flat image as described in section  [ reduxsection ] .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath2  resulting from errors in bias subtraction was measured and found to be less than 1% ( table  [ errorbudget ] ) .",
    "the second potential contributor to the power spectrum is the residual wormy background .",
    "we carefully excluded wormy images and subtracted an estimate of the residual power as described in section  [ reduxsection ] .",
    "if the correction for worms were systematically underestimated , then our measurement of @xmath2  would be too large .",
    "in the previous section we showed that excluding the galaxies contaminated by worms had no significant effect on the measurement of @xmath2 . excluding the lowest s / n measurements also had no significant effect .",
    "the range of @xmath2  values seen during these tests was less than 1 kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the corrections were applied uniformly .",
    "the third potential contributor to the power spectrum is the residual structure in the background from subtraction of the model galaxy profile . to avoid any bias because of the somewhat arbitrary fit of the left - over large - scale structure in the galaxy , we excluded wavenumbers smaller than 20 from our analysis .",
    "the mean uncertainty in the distance modulus from galaxy and smooth background subtraction was 0.02 mag .",
    "residual galactic structure could explain a 1% bias in our @xmath2  measurement , but not a large systematic error .",
    "if the fluctuation powers we measure are reliable , is it possible that other sources of systematic error could cause us to overestimate @xmath2   by 10 to 15% ?",
    "perhaps the most obvious candidate for this kind of systematic error would be the calibration of the f160w absolute fluctuation magnitude .",
    "we used both cepheid and @xmath1-band sbf distances to determine the calibration .",
    "although not completely independent , the two calibrations are remarkably consistent ( 0.01 mag ) .",
    "the agreement between the @xmath1-band sbf and direct cepheid calibration supports the conclusion that there is no significant difference in the fluctuation amplitudes between early and late - type galaxies .",
    "the applicability of the calibration to the more distant galaxies is demonstrated by the overlap with the intermediate - distance sample . to explain a 15% difference in @xmath2",
    ", @xmath47  would have to be brighter by 0.3 mag , or @xmath47@xmath243 .",
    "examination of figure  [ calibration ] shows that a calibration as bright as @xmath95.16 is inconsistent with the data .",
    "significant systematic errors in the cepheid distance scale are relevant to the measurement of the true value of the hubble constant , but can not explain the difference between our measurement and that determined using type - ia supernovae because we adopted the same cepheid calibration as the other groups listed at the beginning of this section .",
    "a systematic error in the distance to the lmc ( for example ) will affect our measurement of @xmath2  in exactly the same way as the other measurements .",
    "is it possible that the mundane choice of galactic extinction corrections could result in a systematic calibration error at the 15% level ? by observing in the near - ir , our sensitivity to errors in the extinction are significantly reduced .",
    "the largest correction in our sample is 0.08 mag ( table  [ sampletable ] ) .",
    "most of the calibrator galaxies have ir extinction corrections of order 0.01 mag .",
    "if extinction has been underestimated , the true fluctuation magnitudes will be brighter than we have estimated and the distances smaller .",
    "increasing extinction corrections makes @xmath2  larger . on the other hand",
    ", extinction can not have been overestimated by very much because the corrections are already very close to zero .",
    "the only other way to get distance measurements that are systematically underestimated by 15% would be for extinction corrections to all three cepheid calibrators used in this paper and all the cepheid calibrators used by tonry et al .",
    "( sbf - ii ) to be overestimated by 0.3 mag , but not those used to calibrate the supernova distance scale .",
    "it seems unlikely that galactic extinction could be the cause of so large a systematic error .",
    "one reason that previous measurements of @xmath2  have disagreed with each other has been the choice of velocities used ( ferrarese et al .",
    "2000a , mould et al .",
    "when @xmath2  is measured on scales where the peculiar motions of individual galaxies are a significant fraction of the hubble velocity , the value of @xmath2  will depend quite sensitively on the velocity adjustments made for infall into local mass concentrations .",
    "our measurement of @xmath2  reaches well into the hubble flow and is distributed uniformly on the sky , and is therefore very insensitive to the choice of velocity model and the peculiar velocities of individual galaxies and clusters ( as described in section  [ flowsection ] ) .",
    "finally , we can not rule out the possibility that modest systematic errors affect both f160w sbf and type - ia supernovae distance measurement techniques in such a way to create the difference between the measurements .",
    "we measured accurate ir sbf distances to a collection of 16 uniformly - distributed distant galaxies for the purpose of measuring the hubble constant well beyond the influence of local peculiar velocities .",
    "these nicmos measurements mark the first time sbfs have been measured in galaxies out to redshifts of 10,000 kms@xmath0 , clearly demonstrating the advantages of measuring sbfs in the near - ir with excellent spatial resolution and low background .",
    "the calibration of the f160w sbf distance scale presented here was based on sbf measurements of galaxies in which cepheid variable stars were detected in the same galaxy . using a maximum - likelihood technique to account both for the influence of local mass concentrations on the velocity field and the non - gaussian uncertainties on our sbf distance measurements yields a hubble contsant of @xmath2@xmath244 kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0  ( 1-@xmath4 statistical uncertainty ) with an additional systematic uncertainty of 6 kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0 , primarily the result of uncertainty in the distance to the lmc .",
    "the small statistical uncertainty in @xmath2  is a result of the fact that our measurement is very insensitive to peculiar velocities , stellar population variations , extinction corrections , and photometric errors . arbitrarily excluding all but the six most distant galaxies from the fit results in a 6% decrease in @xmath2 , consistent with the hypothesis that the local group is located in an under - dense region of the universe .",

    "<S> we measured infrared surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) distances to an isotropically - distributed sample of 16 distant galaxies with redshifts reaching 10,000 kms@xmath0  using the near - ir camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) . </S>",
    "<S> the excellent spatial resolution , very low background , and brightness of the ir fluctuations yielded the most distant sbf measurements to date . </S>",
    "<S> twelve nearby galaxies were also observed and used to calibrate the f160w ( 1.6 ) sbf distance scale . of these </S>",
    "<S> , three have cepheid variable star distances measured with hst and eleven have optical @xmath1-band sbf distance measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a distance modulus of 18.5 mag to the large magellanic cloud was adopted for this calibration . </S>",
    "<S> we present the f160w sbf hubble diagram and find a hubble constant @xmath2@xmath3 ( 1-@xmath4 statistical ) @xmath5 ( systematic ) kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is insensitive to the velocity model used to correct for local bulk motions . restricting the fit to the six most distant galaxies yields the smallest value of @xmath2@xmath6 kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0  consistent with the data . </S>",
    "<S> this 6% decrease in the hubble constant is consistent with the hypothesis that the local group inhabits an under - dense region of the universe , but is also consistent with the best - fit value of @xmath2@xmath7 kms@xmath0mpc@xmath0  at the 1.5-sigma level . </S>"
