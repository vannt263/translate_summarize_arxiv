    "the nature and dynamics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies determines how the energy and matter released by stars are redistributed through the universe .",
    "it is thus critical to understand the ism , and in particular that of the milky way , which can be observed with greater sensitivity and resolution than other galaxies .",
    "the ism in the disk of our galaxy consists of several phases , from dense and cold molecular gas to hot and fully ionized .",
    "stars heat and disperse the dense clouds in which they form , and that hot gas cools and recombines eventually to complete the cycle and form more stars .",
    "it is particularly interesting to consider the interface between this multiphase medium and intergalactic space , where hot gas is released from supernovae to several kiloparsecs in altitude , forming a hot diffuse medium first proposed by @xcite as the galactic corona .",
    "the galactic corona or halo is almost certainly a dynamic object .",
    "it is difficult to construct static halo models , because models supported by thermal pressure are thermally unstable .",
    "if conduction is sufficiently important to stabilize small - scale instabilities , then the entire ( nearly isothermal ) halo is unstable to collapse or expulsion as a wind ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for stability arguments ) .",
    "cosmic - ray supported static halos have been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , but there are considerable uncertainties as to how cosmic rays are confined by the galaxy ( the galactic magnetic field topology in particular ) , and these models do not explain the high and intermediate velocity clouds . considering these things , @xcite first proposed a `` galactic fountain '' of supernova - heated gas rising buoyantly above the disk until it cools and falls back to the disk .",
    "smooth galactic fountain models have been constructed by several authors . in particular , @xcite discussed the issues of radial flow in the galactic gravitational field for a supersonic hot flow which reaches several kiloparsecs height .",
    "more recent models @xcite consist of transsonic flows , which require cooler initial temperatures and only rise to 12  kpc .",
    "these models can help to explain the population of intermediate velocity halo clouds , believed to exist at those lower heights and velocities compared to the more distant high velocity clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cooling layer certainly fragments into small clouds by rayleigh - taylor instability even if no other inhomogeneities exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "superbubbles , worms , and shell - like structures have been observed in ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the upper disk / low halo ( few hundred parsecs altitude ) , but it is difficult to ascertain whether the hot gas is being expelled into the halo .",
    "a related issue is the filling factor of hot gas in the disk , which determines the rate at which hot gas can escape into the halo .",
    "estimates for that filling factor and for the rate of reheating by halo supernovae are based on the evolution of supernova remnants in smooth media , but our current understanding of the ism is increasingly inhomogeneous and dynamic , so those arguments are probably of limited value @xcite .",
    "recently , the combination of good observations , sophisticated numerical models , and sufficient comprehension of the galactic fountain may be beginning to allow identification of fountain - like rising structures @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of interstellar gas in general and specifically in the galactic halo may be best understood by studying the hot phase of the ism ( coronal gas at millions of degrees ) , and gas at temperatures @xmath0105  k intermediate to the hot phase and cooler phases ( 104  k ) . of the different interstellar gas phases ,",
    "the coronal gas is most directly linked to the main sources of energy in the ism , supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "slightly cooler gas is most closely linked to transient and dynamical processes .",
    "this gas is typically short - lived because the cooling time is short at at 105  k. the lithium - like ions of common metals , in particular o6 , n5 , and c4 , are sensitive tracers of interstellar gas at several times 105  k. the resonance absorption lines of these ions are observable with ultraviolet spectrographs on the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",

    "the ions o6 , n5 , and c4 are predicted in models of transient phenomena such as shocks or interfaces between different temperature gas , with conductive heating , turbulent mixing , or rapid radiative cooling ( see * ? ? ? * for a summary ) .",
    "notable , especially for o6 , is the importance of collisional ionization ; by contrast , is produced in such transient phonomena , but is also commonly produced by photoionization in the galaxy . the column densities and column density ratios of these high ions",
    "can be used to determine which physical scenario is predominant in the ism .",
    "the distributions of  and  in the galaxy are ( 0.63)@xmath11013  cm-2  kpc-1 and ( 0.51)@xmath11013  cm-2  kpc-1 respectively @xcite .",
    "the distribution of   is 12 regions per kpc , each with a column density of ( 25)@xmath11013  cm-2 .",
    "these statistics from @xcite came from reanalysis of the _ copernicus _ dataset presented by @xcite , who found a higher frequency of lower column - density features .",
    "the range in the column density ratio log[n()/n( ) ] has been previously measured at -1.5 to -0.5 in the disk and -0.5 to + 0.5 in the halo @xcite .",
    "the values of log[n()/n( ) ] reported by @xcite are -0.4 to -0.9 in the halo , but these represent a small heterogeneous sample of the different lines of sight analyzed by different authors .",
    "the simplest model of gas containing li - like ions is moderately hot gas in collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) ; , , and   peak in ionization fraction at temperatures of @xmath01 , 2 , and 3@xmath1105  k , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio between any two species implies a cie temperature .",
    "if derived from two different ion ratios , this cie temperature does not agree for most real observations of the galactic halo , indicating that the halo is probably not in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "this is seen in figure 1 , in which the cie line ratios lie far to the lower left of more realistic , nonequilibrium models .",
    "although there is some disagreement as to how well atomic abundances are known @xcite , recent changes in the solar abundances of carbon and oxygen are insufficient to bring these two derived temperatures into agreement , and in fact the latest c / o @xcite is very close to older values .    it is important to understand what the predicted ion column density ratios are in more dynamic physical models , beginning with conductive interfaces . @xcite modeled the evaporation of evaporating spherical clouds with nonequilibrium ionization .",
    "they presented results for a small ( @xmath2 = 5  pc ) isolated cloud in a @xcite type model of cool cloudlets in a hot medium of large filling factor .",
    "relative to calculations of evaporation with collisional ionization equilibrium , the total column densities of the li - like ions is increased , as is the distance from the cloud at which those species reach their maximum abundance .",
    "both effects result from delayed ionization ( up to the li - like ionization stage but especially up to the he - like stage ) as the gas is conductively heated .",

    "these authors also included a magnetic field , which can suppress thermal conduction if oriented parallel to the interface .",
    "the total column densities of all species are lower in this case , but the n()/n( )  and n()/n( )  ratios also decrease , because the evaporated gas is hotter , and the overall ionization state of the front is increased .",

    " , , and  are produced both in the cooling , overionized hot gas , and in the heating , underionized cool gas .",
    "these models are physically interesting because the topology of the interstellar medium includes many interfaces between hot and cold gas moving at substantial relative velocities",
    ". the models can produce a large range of ion column density ratios and generally produce smaller total column densities per interface than the other models .",
    "however , a number of the model parameters are unconstrained by the current state of the observations .",
    "although  and can be produced by photoionization near hot stars and somewhat in the ism by ambient stellar ionizing radiation and the soft x - ray background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and  are almost definitely collisionally ionized in the galactic disk and halo . nevertheless , there are some models that produce these ions by photoionization near a sufficiently hot source .",
    "@xcite found that hydrogen - rich white dwarfs can produce some   in their strmgren spheres and in diffuse regions if the circumstellar medium is patchy .",
    "the li - like ion column densities depend on impact parameter of a line of sight with the strmgren sphere , and also increase rapidly with increasing average ism density ( values in table [ modeltable ] are for @xmath4 = 0.11.0  cm-3 ) .",
    "line ratios for model production mechanisms for li - like ions are plotted in figure [ diagnostic ] .",
    "clearly , measurements of these line ratios can help to distinguish between different models .",
    "additional detail may even be possible  for example , in the conductive interface models of @xcite and @xcite ( `` x ' 's in figure [ diagnostic ] ) , models with increasing magnetic field suppressing the conduction are located farther to the lower left of the diagram .",
    "it should be noted that the interstellar abundances of the atoms whose ions are being studied here are not well determined .",
    "the models presented above are for solar abundances , reported in @xcite , mostly from the work of @xcite , measured in meteorites and in the solar atmosphere .",
    "this technique is particularly difficult for c , n , and o. the models given later in this paper build on the models above , and so the implicit metallicities are those of @xcite .",
    "there is the additional uncertainty of whether solar abundances are appropriate for the general interstellar medium : it has been proposed that the sun may have uncharacteristically high elemental abundances ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the lower mean abundances in b stars may be more appropriate @xcite .",
    "the recent downward revision of the solar c , n , and o abundances may bring the interstellar standard back closer to solar @xcite .",
    "gas in the galactic halo in particular has less than solar abundances , although if the hot gas being observed is recently ejected from the disk , it is less clear what adjustment needs to be made .",
    "if elements are depleted onto dust grains , this will most significantly affect n ( ) .",
    "it will also somewhat decrease n ( ) , and n()/n( )  ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * in the specific context of conductive interface models ) .",
    "the li - like ions , , and   are produced in nonequilibrium physical situations , such as shocks , conductive interfaces , and rapidly cooling gas (   [ hotmodels ] ) .",
    "the different ions are generally produced at different flow velocities in the structure , so a viewer looking through such a structure will see trends in the ion column density ratios as a function of line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the ratio - velocity signature in relevant physical situations must be considered to properly interpret trends in the data .",
    "such models are presented in the following pages . for conductive interfaces",
    ", we took existing models and calculated the velocity signature that would be observed along a sightline passing through the interface . for radiative shocks , we ran the shock code of j. raymond and calculated the velocity signature . for supernova remnants",
    ", we consider the velocity - resolved results previously presented by @xcite . finally , for a galactic fountain , we integrated the steady - state equations published by @xcite , coupled with the recombination code of @xcite , to determine the ionization structure as a function of line - of - sight velocity .",
    "one of the oldest interface models containing the li - like ions is that of a conductive interface .",
    "figure [ bohringer - vel ] shows the log of column density ratios as extracted from the models of @xcite .",
    "we created this figure by extracting the li - like ion fraction , temperature , outflow velocity , and pressure as a function of radius from their plots and calculating the column density of the li - like ions at each radius .",
    "then , we integrated the column density over radius , with a parcel of gas at a certain radius modeled in the absorption spectrum as a gaussian velocity component centered at the outflow velocity at that radius and having the thermal width of the gas at that radius .",
    "@xcite present more sophisticated conductive interface models , with time evolution and a magnetic field . although the authors do not provide spatially resolved ionization information , they note that the thickness of an ionized layer increases with ionization stage , with  occupying @xmath00.3  pc ,  13  pc , and @xmath08  pc . during the initial evaporative phase ,",
    "the velocity structure shown in their figure 4 appears similar to the models of @xcite , and would thus also show a decrease of ionization stage with increasing outward velocity .",
    "it is unfortunately not possible to verify this from the limited information presented in @xcite . during the steady - state and condensing phases",
    ", there is flow back from the hot medium , and thus for the longest - lasting phase of the model , increasing ionization towards more negative velocities would apparently still be observed . from the point of view of an observer in the cool cloud , n()/n( )  and n()/n( )  would increase towards more positive velocities as in the @xcite models , but the absorption would be seen at overall negative velocities . naturally the situation is reversed for an observer in the hot medium .",
    "an interesting note is that the models of @xcite predict increasing linewidths with ionization potential .",
    "linewidths are primarily thermal , and the mean temperature at which a certain ion is found increases with ionization potential .",
    "the effect is much more pronouced ( @xmath025% increase in linewidth ) from  to  than from  to   ( @xmath04% increase )",
    ". the observations of @xcite and @xcite note an increase in line width between  and along sightlines that pass through the disk and halo of the galaxy .",
    "new observations ( paper ii ) also show a hint of downturn in the n()/n( )  ratios in the line wings , consistent with the trend seem by other investigators for narrower  linewidths than other li - like ions .",
    "no such trend is seen in the n()/n( )  ratio , but in conductive interfaces similar to the models of @xcite and in gas in collisional ionization equilibrium , the expected linewidth difference is much smaller between  and   than between  and  .",
    "shock waves are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium",
    ". of particular interest here are the possible shock at the edge of the local bubble and shocks in a galactic fountain flow .",
    "the latter could arise on the way up , either in the tops of supershells that are bursting out of the disk , oblique shocks in more complicated structures which are breaking out , or on the way down , with condensed clouds reshocking against the diffuse halo as they return to the disk .",
    "there is evidence of   in high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , which could result from shocking as they fall through the halo .",
    "however , if the halo is close to the virial temperature , then the mach number of the hvcs is only @xmath51.21.5 , marginally high enough to shock ionize up to  .",
    "figure [ shock ] shows the structure of a 200  km  s-1 radiative shock , which we calculated using the raymond shock code ( j. raymond , private communication 1998 , * ? ? ?",
    "gas immediately behind the shock is highly underionized compared to its high temperature .",
    "cooling is slow above a few million degrees and the gas ionizes up .",
    "further behind the shock rapid cooling takes place and the gas recombines back through the various stages . there is thus a secondary rise in li - like ions in the cooling zone , the degree of which depends on how much of the he - like ions were produced , which depends on the shock velocity and the metallicity of the gas .",
    "the details of the ionization - velocity structure seen by an observer looking through a shock may change depending on these parameters , but the general trend is the same , because the bulk of the observed li - like ions are are seen as the gas is ionizing up , and , , and   are ionized sequentially as the flow velocity slows down .",
    "figure [ shock_no ] illustrates the ion column density ratio as a function of rest - frame flow velocity , i.e. the line - of - sight velocity seen looking through a shock moving towards the observer . as before",
    ", the thickness of the line scales with the density of  and   present along the line of sight , so although there are parts of the shock in the cooling zone in which the column density ratio n()/n( ) increases with velocity , in the part of the shock with the largest column of those ions , the ratio is decreasing with velocity . a negative slope of n()/n( ) with increasingly positive velocity would be observed in a sightline dominated by a a shock moving towards towards the observer , for example on the front faces of galactic fountain or high velocity clouds falling back to the disk and being shocked against the diffuse halo gas .",
    "another structure which may be particularly relevant to observations of li - like ions in the galactic halo is a supernova remnant shell .",
    "the tops of superbubble shells may be launched into the halo as partially coherent clouds , and if we are living inside a superbubble , there may be remnants of the top of our shell above us , through which many of the sightlines in this study would pass .",
    "@xcite modeled evolving supernova remnant ( snr ) bubbles expanding in ambient conditions typical of the lower halo .",
    "in particular , she presented the velocity - resolved column densities of li - like ions ( her figure 11 ) . those values and the column density ratios",
    "are shown in figure [ shelton ] . clearly , the ion - ratio profile depends on the stage of evolution of the snr . at very early stages ,",
    "the interior of the remnant has not yet ionized past the li - like stages , so these species are found both behind the shock and in the interior , leading to the double - peaked profile in column density .",
    "later , the ions are found in the cooling but overionized gas at the periphery of the remnant . finally ,",
    "as the aged remnant cools ,   and  are found mostly in the interior , and  near the outskirts .",
    "the profiles of aged remnants are most relevant to the possibility of our looking out through our own superbubble shell , and these profiles show a decrease in n()/n( ) with increasing velocity . additionally , if there is a rising shell above our superbubble , it is probably fragmented owing to rayleigh - taylor instabilities as the superbubble blowout expands through the density gradient out of the galactic disk .",
    "fragmentation and further disturbance by kelvin - helmholtz instability , as the shell passes through more stationary diffuse gas , would confuse any velocity - ionization signature .",
    "the nature of our local bubble would be better tested with spectroscopy towards stars just outside the local bubble , in which the gas at the bubble interface could be observed independently from other gas which may be involved in different physical processes .",
    "the theoretical ion - ratio profiles of remnants at different ages could be very useful for such local bubble observations , or other observations in the disk of the galaxy which pass through known remnants .",
    "if the geometry is well - enough understood , observations of the column density ratio could determine the age of the remnant .",
    "the nature of a galactic fountain flow is determined by how the quickly gas cools and recombines as it flows upwards out of the disk .",
    "quantitatively , the comparison is between the cooling time @xmath6 and the sound crossing time @xmath7 , which is roughly the time to establish hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the adiabatic exponent , @xmath10 is the atomic weight , and @xmath11 is the cooling function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* who discuss the nature of the fountain flow for the different values of @xmath12 ) .",
    "if @xmath13 then a static system can be established , but it will be unstable to convective overturn and thermal instability ( as noted by * ? ? ?",
    "* the cooling rate of the static structure is highest at the top of the halo , so clouds will condense out from the top down and be formed with small negative velocities ) . if @xmath14 then a supersonic flow will occur .",
    "as the gas cools rapidly it is thermally unstable and will condense into clouds which fall out of the flow .",
    "the scale height of the gas is then set by the cooling time @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the sound speed at the base of the fountain , and clouds can be formed with positive ( upward ) velocities . for @xmath17 ,",
    "transsonic fountain flows exist with clouds forming near the adiabatic density scale height .",
    "modeling of the velocity - ionization structure of a galactic fountain will focus here on the transsonic solution ( @xmath18 ) of @xcite .",
    "( as discussed below , flow solutions in which the cooling and equilibrium times are very different are not as well - suited to analytic treatment . ) figure [ hb ] shows the structure of the @xcite fountain flow , an integration of the one - dimensional steady - state fluid equations , which pass through a sonic point .",
    "the equations have the same topology as a standard solar / stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the solution stagnates at the top , forming an unphysical dense layer , but in this zone of rapid cooling clouds will condense out with near - zero or small positive vertical velocities and fall back to the disk .",
    "figure [ dielectric ] shows the oxygen ionization fractions in a nonequilibrium cooling fountain flow , which we calculated using the nonequilibrium recombination code of @xcite .",
    "we integrated the recombination rate through the temperature and electron density given as a function of time and vertical velocity by the @xcite transsonic fountain .",
    "it would be slightly more consistent to integrate the fluid equations with @xcite nonequilibrium cooling instead of the @xcite nonequilibrium cooling used by @xcite , but the differences in the cooling curves are small enough for the combination to be accurate ( r. benjamin , private communication 2001 ) .",
    "o7 can not recombine fast enough as the flow cools rapidly through its collisional ionization equilibrium temperature,@xmath0(510)@xmath1105  k. significant o7 remains to low temperatures ( @xmath19105  k if the density is low enough ) , until dielectronic recombination allows a recombination cascade .",
    "the result is that not only does   persist to low temperatures because it is `` frozen in '' ( it can not recombine fast enough to keep up with cooling ) , but there can be a _ rise _ in the   fraction as the he - like o7 recombines .",
    "this happens for the other li - like ions  and  for the same reasons .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is dependent on dielectronic recombination rates which have undergone continual revision with time @xcite , and makes the modeling of li - like ions in cooled ( t@xmath0104  k ) clouds uncertain ( see discussion and a crude model below ) .",
    "figure [ hbratio ] shows the ion column density ratio calculated by coupling the @xcite reionization with the @xcite transsonic fountain .",
    "the parameters for this particular model are set by choosing the fountain base temperature to be 6@xmath1105  k. the two branches in the first plot are a result of the velocity of the fountain accelerating , then decelerating again after passing through the sonic point . the horizontal upper branch is from the rapidly cooled gas at a few 104  k , which will condense into clouds and fall out of the flow .",
    "the column density of li - like ions at this point in the flow is highly uncertain , and the column plotted here is probably an overestimate .",
    "( r. benjamin , private communication 2001 ) .",
    "the width of the line in the plot scales with the column density of  and   at that point in the flow .",
    "thus , an observation through the fountain is dominated by the rising , cooling gas .",
    "the second plot shows the ion column density ratio which would be observed using absorption spectroscopy .",
    "each parcel of gas in the flow was convolved with the thermal width at that point in the flow to create an observed absorption profile , and the ion ratio is calculated from that observed profile .",
    "since the transsonic fountain accelerates , n()/n( ) increases with increasingly positive velocity .",
    "however , the trend is very weak due to the small velocity gradient in this fountain model , and it is not clear that the transsonic smooth fountain is a realistic description of the patchy galactic halo .    it has been noted @xcite that there have been two types of galactic fountain models in the literature , those with somewhat smoothly distributed rising gas over the disk , as used here , and models that focus on the evolution of superbubbles as the fountain drivers , irregularly spaced in time and galactic location ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although the latter model is driven differently and rises to larger galactic altitude than that of @xcite , the cooling and equilibrium times are still close , the expected spread of velocity in the rising gas is modest , and so the observed ion column density ratio as a function of velocity is probably not qualitatively different from the model considered here .",
    "what is needed is an improvement over either type of simple model , i.e. full multidimensional time - dependent models of the fountain with nonequilibrium cooling and nonequilibrium reionization .",
    "galactic fountain flows in which the cooling and equilibrium times are very different are less well - suited to an analytic treatment because , as discussed above , it is difficult to accurately follow the recombination state of gas which is highly overionized but which has cooled to @xmath0104  k and thermally condensed . in a supersonic fountain ( @xmath20 ) clouds condense quickly and observations are dominated by this uncertain cool phase . in a highly subsonic fountain ( @xmath13 ) there is no velocity signature because the gas rises and establishes a quasistatic configuration before cooling through the li - like ions .",
    "any difference in ionization as a function of velocity again occurs in the cold clouds .",
    "nevertheless , to estimate the behavior of recombination in cool clouds , figure  [ recomb ] shows the ion column density ratio as a function of time for a crude model .",
    "we consider a cloud formed by thermal instability in a smooth fountain flow at 104  k with , n6 ,  , and o7 ionization fractions of 0.06 , 0.01 , 0.02 , and 0.005 respectively .",
    "these values are fairly uncertain , and were taken from @xcite with consideration of @xcite and @xcite and the known limitations of these models ( r. benjamin , private communication 2001 ) .",
    "the cloud cools slowly at a few @xmath1104  k , remaining in pressure equilibrium with the rising smooth hot halo , and thus the density increases , but not by a huge factor . at the same time ,",
    "hydrogen recombines , so the electron density must decrease . considering the other large uncertainties of this model ,",
    "the simple approximation is adequate to allow hydrogen to recombine down to the hydrogen ionization fractions @xmath21 observed in diffuse halo clouds @xcite and modeled in photoionization equilibrium with ionizing radiation escaping from the galactic disk @xcite or old supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "total ( radiative and dielectronic ) recombination rates were mostly taken from @xcite , which shows significant differences from previous work .",
    "the ion ratio n()/n( ) first decreases with time , as the  total recombination rate is larger than that for  .",
    "this fact was not true for the older rates of @xcite .",
    "the column density ratio then rises as additional  and   recombine down from n6 and o7 ( the recombination rate for the latter is larger ) . as elsewhere",
    ", the thickness of the line in figure [ recomb ] scales with the local density of  and  .",
    "the behavior of the ion ratio with time ( how much it rises at late times , etc . ) varies with the choice of initial ionization fractions , but the recombination time in the cool cloud is always short compared to the return time for the ballistically traveling cloud : the cloud velocity in the galactic gravitational field ( @xmath2210 - 8  cm  s-2 ) only changes by 3 km  s-1 in the 106  year recombination time .",
    "thus any change in the ionization ratio as a function of velocity determined by the distribution of vertical velocities of clouds at their formation time , not by a slow change in ionization state as the clouds decelerate .",
    "the height and vertical velocity of cloud formation depends on the initial temperature of the fountain as discussed above , and simulations show a fairly large spread for a given fountain flow @xcite .",
    "although the general assertion can be made that clouds recombine as they travel the fountain flow , no conclusions can be drawn about an observable velocity - ionization signature from this type of simple considerations of single clouds .",
    "what is needed are full nonequilibrium 3-d simulations of fountain dynamics .",
    "although the most consistent model of the halo is of a dynamic flow of gas heated and ionized by ( thermal ) collisions , it is worth considering some of the other physics that could be important and how that might relate to observed li - like ion column density ratios .",
    "magnetic fields play a large , but usually neglected , role in interstellar dynamics .",
    "for example , the magnetic pressure in the galactic disk is about the same as the thermal pressure .",
    "synchrotron emission from our galactic halo and the halos of other galaxies show that the scale height of the magnetic field is large @xcite .",
    "dissipation of magnetic energy is a viable mechanism for heating gas to millions of degrees in the disk @xcite , moderately ionizing and heating diffuse gas in halo @xcite , and even in producing the x - ray emission of boundary regions of high velocity clouds passing through the halo @xcite .",
    "@xcite presents a quasistatic halo model in which the gas is heated by magnetic reconnection .",
    "the model can produce reasonable column densities of high and moderately ionized species , and reasonable intensities for emission lines of those species .",
    "it may have some difficulty fitting both the highly ionized species and the less ionized species , because the lower energy reconnection mechanism which is invoked requires possibly more magnetic power than is available in the galaxy .",
    "in addition , this model would have no kinematic signature , being quasistatic , and the stability of such a model is not discussed in @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays are another sometimes neglected but important part of the interstellar medium .",
    "again , the cosmic ray pressure in the plane is comparable to the thermal and magnetic pressures .",
    "@xcite presented a simple static halo supported by cosmic rays ( cr ) , and argued that the stability times are of the order of 107  years .",
    "more recent work calls into question the stability of cr supported haloes , especially in the presence of cr diffusion which makes cr supported structures more rayleigh - taylor unstable @xcite . a static cr supported halo",
    "would also not have variation of ion column density ratios with line - of - sight velocity .",
    "perhaps more likely is a cr - driven wind , which may operate in parallel with a galactic fountain , driving material out in regions of open magnetic field topology , while lofted material in regions of closed magnetic field falls can fall back to the disk @xcite .",
    "these authors concentrate on the cr - driven outflow at hundreds of kiloparsecs from the disk , but their model does have monotonically increasing velocity as gas rises and cools , entrained in the cr wind .",
    "the gradient of @xmath04 km  s-1  kpc-1 is almost identical to that in the lower part of the @xcite transsonic fountain , and thus would have a very similar trend of ion column density ratio with velocity .",
    "there is the possibility that damping of hydromagnetic waves in the outflow can transfer energy to the gas ; the recombination of the gas could be thus delayed to higher altitudes , where the velocity gradient is smaller , and perhaps a steeper change in ion column density ratio as a function of velocity could be produced . to fully understand the li - like ions in this cr wind , more specific discussion of ionization is required than is provided in @xcite .",
    "finally , one can consider that the halo gas is partially photoionized .",
    "it has been argued that photoionization is not negligible in the halo @xcite , but it is difficult to explain species with large ionization potentials by photoionization , namely  and  .",
    "this can be easily shown by calculating the path lengths required to produce the observed n()/n( ) column density ratio and simultaneously the total column , or the n()/n( ) ratio .",
    "the conclusion is similar for the entire data set : ion column density ratios require high ionization parameters and low space densities , but substantial column densities then require path lengths of tens or even hundreds of kiloparsecs , which is unreasonable to fit in the galactic halo .",
    "in addition , the two ion ratios n()/n( ) and n()/n( ) can not simultaneously fit a photoionization model in most cases .",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the number density of hydrogen - ionizing photons ) derived from n()/n( ) is about 0.2 dex lower than that derived from n()/n( ) , indicative of a different ( collisional ) ionization source .",
    "we have considered the diagnostic power of velocity - resolved column density ratios in understanding the galactic halo .",
    "column density ratios of li - like ions in the galaxy are useful to diagnose the physical formation mechanism of the gas and to study the interstellar gas cycle , and a survey of these ions can reveal general trends . in paper ii , we present a survey of sightlines observed with fuse and hst , in which the distribution of n ( ) and n( ) in the halo does not appear to favor a dominant physical production mechanism .    here , we have presented models of interfaces and cooling nonequilibrium gas , focusing on the velocity - resolved n()/n( ) signatures . in particular",
    ", we consider conductive interfaces , radiative shocks and supernova remnants , and cooling gas in a galactic fountain .",
    "typical ion column density ratios are summarized in table  [ summary ] , along with a typical observed slope observed in fuse and hst data .",
    "one important type of hot / cool gas interface for which the ionization - velocity signature has not been discussed is the turbulent mixing layer @xcite .",
    "the structure of these li - like ion producing structures is uncertain .",
    "it is likely that there is a turbulent cascade of eddies which would wash out any velocity - ionization signature , but there may possibly be large kelvin - helmholtz rolls with some coherent velocity signature .",
    "the observable velocity - ionization trends are weak , because even very strong trends are washed out by the large thermal width of the gas at different parts of the flow .",
    "these trends could be further complicated by thermal instabilities , which likely occur in cooling gas such as in a fountain flow , and can also affect shocks and supernova shells .",
    "fragementation of the gas into parcels with complex density and velocity structure , as seen in the time - dependent shock model of @xcite could complicate the signatures described here .",
    "additional confusion can result when long sightlines pass through multiple structures . as we show in paper ii , the dispersion of n()/n( ) ,",
    "both integrated and velocity - resolved , indicates that no single production scenario known to date can completely explain the galactic halo . to truly understand the physical production of li - like ions in the halo",
    ", one needs to analyze gas in localized areas of physical space , rather than velocity space .",
    "absorption spectroscopy towards many halo stars with close angular separation and different distances could help to isolate gas at a specific altitude .",
    "similarly , the gas above known superbubble shells or chimneys could be isolated .",
    "these observations have a greater chance of distinguishing between models of hot gas production than observations along long lines of sight .",
