    "millimeter continuum observations reveal a massive core @xmath6m@xmath2 with h@xmath7o and ch@xmath1oh maser emission , and a weak 1mjy source is detected at 3.6 cm @xcite . as part of a single - dish co outflow study , wing emission indicative of molecular outflows was detected but the co map was too confused to define a bipolar outflow @xcite . during these observations , @xcite also observed sio(21 ) at 3 mm , and bipolar structure was detected in the north - south direction .",

    "iras18089 - 1732 was observed with the sma between may and july 2003 in two different configurations with 3 to 5 antennas in the array .",
    "the phase reference center of the observations was r.a.[j2000 ] 18:11:51.4 and dec.[j2000 ] @xmath8:31:28.5 .",
    "the frequency was centered on the sio(54 ) line at 217.105ghz , the hcooch@xmath1(2019 ) line at 216.967ghz could be observed simultaneously in the same band .",
    "the hcooch@xmath1 line consists of 8 distinct components but is dominated by 4 of them which are separated by 2.5mhz ( corresponding to 3.5 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the correlator bandwidth at that time was 1ghz with a frequency resolution of 0.825mhz .",
    "we smoothed the sio(54 ) data to a spectral resolution of 3kms@xmath9 and the hcooch@xmath1(2019 ) data to 2kms@xmath9 to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "figure [ continuum ] compares the ( sub-)mm continuum observations and shows additional cm continuum and h@xmath7o and ch@xmath1oh maser data @xcite . even in the highest - spatial - resolution data at 850@xmath0 m ,",
    "the dust emission remains singly peaked , i.e. , it does not split up into multiple sources as observed in other massive star - forming regions , e.g. , iras19410 + 2336 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in our 1 mm data we resolve elongated emission in the south and north - west , which demonstrates that iras18089 - 1732 has a compact mm core with extended halo emission ( fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ) .",
    "the halo emission is not seen in the 850@xmath0 m observations because of the reduced sensitivity and uv - coverage .",
    "while the weak 3.6 cm peak and the h@xmath7o maser position coincide exactly with the ( sub-)mm continuum peak , the ch@xmath1oh maser position is about @xmath14 to the south .",
    "the latter could indicate that there might be a second source at the position of the ch@xmath1oh maser which we can not distinguish .",
    "table [ para ] shows the derived peak and integrated fluxes ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) at 1 mm and 850@xmath0 m . comparing the sma 1 mm data with single - dish observations of the region @xcite",
    ", we find that about @xmath17 of the flux is filtered out in the interferometric data .",
    "it is difficult to derive a spectral index from the continuum images because the different uv - coverages filter out different amounts of flux .",
    "however , we can measure fluxes @xmath18 in the uv - plane .",
    "ideally , one would select the same regions in the uv - plane , but as this would reduce the amount of available data even more , it is reasonable to compare the values for matching baseline ranges ( in units of @xmath19 ) .",
    "we selected one range of short baselines ( @xmath20 , corresponding to spatial scales between @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) and one range of longer baselines ( @xmath23 , corresponding to spatial scales between @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) where there were sufficient data in both frequency bands : the flux values are shown in table [ para ] .",
    "the 3.6 cm flux is only 0.9mjy @xcite , and assuming free - free emission its contribution to the sub-(mm ) observations is negligible . assuming a power - law relation @xmath26 in the rayleigh - jeans limit with the dust opacity index @xmath27 , we find @xmath28 for short baselines corresponding to large spatial scales and @xmath29 for large baselines corresponding to small spatial scales .",
    "these values are lower than the canonical value of 2 @xcite and decrease to small spatial scales .",
    "the exact values should be taken with caution due to the large calibration uncertainty ( estimated to be within @xmath13 ) , but the trend of a low @xmath27 decreasing with decreasing spatial scales appears real . without mapping the selected sets of uv - data in the image - plane , we can not determine whether the smaller spatial scales correspond to the central core or to another unresolved structure .",
    "however , the 850@xmath0 m continuum image , which is based on larger baselines , is more compact than the 1.3 mm emission ( fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ) indicating that the largest baselines do trace the emission from the core center",
    ". a low value of @xmath27 has also recently been found in another high - mass star - forming region @xcite , and @xcite report that @xmath27 decreases in l1489 from 1.5 - 2 in the envelope down to @xmath30 at the inner peak .",
    "this trend may be due to grain growth within the central core / disk or high optical depth .",
    "assuming optically thin dust emission at mm wavelength , we calculate the mass and peak column density using the 1.3 mm data following the procedure outlined for the single - dish dust continuum data by @xcite .",
    "we use a grain emissivity index @xmath31 and a temperature typical for hot - core - like sources of 100k .",
    "the central core mass then is @xmath32m@xmath2 and the peak column density @xmath33 @xmath34 , corresponding to a visual extinction @xmath35 } = n_{\\rm{h_2}}/(10^{21}\\rm{cm}^{-2 } ) \\sim 800 $ ] . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the errors are dominated by systematics , e.g. , exact knowledge of @xmath27 or the temperature .",
    "we estimate the masses and column densities to be correct within a factor of 5 .",
    "figure [ channel ] presents a channel map of sio(54 ) , and we find blue and red emission ( systemic velocity 34.9kms@xmath9 ,  [ hcooch3 ] ) north of the continuum core .",
    "the sio emission by itself allows an interpretation of a bipolar outflow centered @xmath36 north of the core .",
    "however , we do not detect any sub - mm continuum source there ( @xmath37 m @xmath38 mass sensitivity @xmath39m@xmath2 ) , and a massive outflow without a sub - mm continuum source at the driving center is very unlikely .",
    "therefore , we favor the interpretation of an outflow emanating from the core toward the north with a position - angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath40 .",
    "the fact that we see blue and red sio emission toward the northern lobe indicates that the outflow axis is near the plane of the sky . for the red lobe",
    ", we find an increase in velocity with distance from the center of the core resembling the hubble - law within molecular outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous unpublished single - dish sio(21 ) observations with @xmath41 resolution also show a bipolar outflow in the north - south direction .",
    "the main difference is that the southern part of the sio(21 ) outflow is not observed at the higher frequency and higher spatial resolution with the sma .",
    "we can attribute this difference to several possible reasons .",
    "first , interferometers filter out the large scale emission , and without additional short spacing information , only the more compact jet - like emission is detected with the sma .",
    "second , the excitation of the 54 transition is higher with respect to the 21 transition .",
    "while the sio(21 ) line traces the lower temperature gas , the sio(54 ) line is sensitive to the more excited gas being associated with the more collimated component of the outflow .",
    "furthermore , an asymmetry in the small - scale distribution of the dense gas can also contribute to the differences of the large - scale sio(21 ) and small - scale sio(54 ) observations .",
    "the high - density - gas tracing molecular hcooch@xmath1(2019 ) emission is confined to the central core traced by the ( sub-)mm continuum ( fig . [ channel ] ) .",
    "a gaussian fit to the central spectrum results in a systemic velocity of @xmath42kms@xmath9 , and we observe a velocity gradient across the core .",
    "it is possible to fit the peak position of each spectral channel shown in figure [ channel ] to a higher accuracy than the nominal spatial resolution , down to 0.5hpbw/(s / n ) , with s / n the signal - to - noise ratio @xcite .",
    "we performed these fits in the uv - plane to avoid artifacts due to inverting and cleaning the data , the resulting positions are shown in figure [ pos_velo ] .",
    "the derived velocity gradient follows a p.a .",
    "of @xmath43 from blue to red velocities .",
    "the separation of the most blue and most red positions is @xmath44 , corresponding to @xmath45au .",
    "figure [ pos_velo ] also presents a position - velocity diagram for the fitted channels at the p.a .",
    "of @xmath46 confirming the space - velocity shift .",
    "this velocity gradient is neither in the direction of the sio outflow nor directly perpendicular to it .",
    "a velocity gradient solely due to a rotating disk would be perpendicular to the outflow .",
    "the sio outflow is near the plane of the sky complicating an accurate determination of its p.a . , and the outflow might also be affected by precession ( e.g. , iras20126 + 4104 , @xcite ) . regarding the hcooch@xmath1 emission , it is unlikely that this high - density tracer depicts a different outflow which would remain undetected by the sio .",
    "therefore , we regard neither the partially uncertain outflow p.a . nor a second outflow sufficient to explain the difference in p.a . between the sio and the hcooch@xmath1 emission . however , as shown in the accompanying paper ( beuther et al . ,",
    "this volume ) , most molecular line data are influenced by the molecular outflow , and it is likely that hcooch@xmath1 is also affected by the outflow .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown that infall can influence the dense - gas velocity signature as well .",
    "assuming that the inner core contains a rotating disk , which has an orientation perpendicular to the outflow , and that the hcooch@xmath1 velocity signature is influenced by the disk , the outflow and infall , it is plausible that the observed axis of the hcooch@xmath1 velocity gradient is offset from the expected disk orientation .",
    "we do not observe the inner region of the disk where the outflow / jet is accelerated , but we may have detected the outer parts of the accretion - disk .",
    "assuming equilibrium between centrifugal and gravitational forces at the outer radius of the disk , we calculate the dynamical mass enclosed within the central @xmath47 to be @xmath48m@xmath2 ( with @xmath49 the unknown inclination angle between the disk plane and the line of sight , and an hcooch@xmath1 velocity shift . taking into account the 4 dominant hcooch@xmath1 line components spanning 3.5kms@xmath9 (  [ obs ] ) ,",
    "the hcooch@xmath1 velocity shift is @xmath50 . ] of 4.25kms@xmath9 ) , of the order of the core mass derived from the dust emission ( table [ para ] ) .",
    "thus , in contrast to t tauri systems where the disk mass is negligible compared with the protostellar mass , in iras18089 - 1732 a considerable fraction of the enclosed mass seems to be part of a large accretion disk and/or rotating envelope .",
    "this result fits the picture that iras18089 - 1732 is in a very young evolutionary state , with the central ( proto)star still accreting material from the surrounding core / disk .",
    "the combined sio(54 ) and hcooch@xmath1(2019 ) observations toward iras18089 - 1732 support a massive star formation scenario where high - mass stars form in a similar fashion as their low - mass counterparts , i.e. , via disk accretion accompanied by collimated jets / outflows .",
    "the hcooch@xmath1 observations still barely resolve the disk / envelope structure and the interpretation is not entirely unambiguous , but the data indicate rotation which might stem at least partly from an accretion disk . higher resolution observations in different disk tracers are needed to investigate the disk / envelope conditions in more detail . furthermore , the continuum data indicate a lower @xmath27 than the standard value of 2 , and we observe a decreasing @xmath27 with decreasing spatial scales . as nearly all the gas observed in dust emission takes part in the assumed dynamical rotation observed in hcooch@xmath1 this low @xmath27 might be due to grain growth or high opacity within a disk - like structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) ."
