    "as the most concrete realization of holographic principle , the gauge / gravity duality @xcite has been fruitful in revealing universal features of strongly coupled field theories by gravitational description and also has the  potential ability of encoding the quantum gravity using field theory language .",
    "the duality has gone beyond the equilibrium and near - equilibrium processes , relating the thermalization of far - from - equilibrium boundary gauge theories to the gravitational collapse and the formation of black holes in the bulk .",
    "the non - equilibrium holography is well motivated by the demand of describing the fast thermalization of the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider @xcite , in which the onset of a hydrodynamic regime is found to be earlier than weak coupling estimates @xcite , and of describing the quantum quench that indicates the unitary evolution of a quantum system with a sudden change of coupling constants and can be realized experimentally in cold atom systems @xcite .    in order to explore the dynamics and",
    "the scale dependence of thermalization processes , the local observables , such as the expectation values of energy - momentum tensor , can not provide sufficient information as in the situation of viscous hydrodynamics .",
    "one important non - local observable is the entanglement entropy ( ee ) between some spatial region and its complement @xcite .",
    "usually ee is taken as a valuable probe to assess the amount of entanglement and acts as an order parameter to witness various quantum phases @xcite .",
    "moreover , ee does not depend on the details of theories and exists even in non - equilibrium quantum systems in which there is no well - defined thermal entropy and temperature .",
    "a precise holographic description of ee has been proposed via ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "it is calculated as the area of the minimum surface in the bulk with its uv boundary coincident with the entangling surface in the dual field theory .",
    "the prescription of holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) has passed many nontrivial tests @xcite , but there is no formal derivation until very recently @xcite . respecting the clear geometric image of hee and the important role of quantum entanglement in many - body quantum systems , the comparison between hee and ee may be very useful to provide new insights into the quantum structure of spacetime raamsdonk09,swingle09,vilaplana11,bala1108,takayanagi12,takayanagi1302,maldacena13,myers1102,hubeny1204,hubeny1302 , particularly in the framework of the entanglement renormalization mera .",
    "although hee is previously defined only for static systems , a covariant generalization is applicable to dynamical cases @xcite , where one should calculate hee as the area of extremal surface and select the minimum one if there are several extremal surfaces .",
    "there is another interesting non - local observable , namely the mutual information ( mi ) @xcite , which measures the total ( both classical and quantum ) correlations between two spatial subregions and acts as an upper bound of the connected correlation functions in those regions wolf07 .",
    "mi is related to ee closely .",
    "considering two subsystems @xmath0 and @xmath1 , one can define mi as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the ee on the subregion @xmath0 .",
    "mi shares many features of ee in nontrivial ways .",
    "for instance , ee has a ubiquitous area law , that is divergent due to the presence of high energy singularities in unregulated quantum field theories .",
    "the divergent contributions cancel in mi between separate regions , leaving it as a scheme - independent quantity .",
    "but when @xmath0 and @xmath1 approach each other , the same short - distance divergence of ee appears again @xcite .",
    "it has been found in cfts that mi has power to extract more refined information than ee @xcite .",
    "mi has also been studied in strongly coupling field theories with gravity duals both in static @xcite and dynamic background @xcite . in particular ,  for @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the size of @xmath0 and @xmath6 is the inverse temperature , it was found @xcite that the static hee ( both for @xmath7-dim relativistic cfts and non - relativistic scale - invariant theories ) can be schematically decomposed as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the divergent boundary law , @xmath10 is thermal entropy , @xmath11 follows an area law and @xmath12 is the correction suppressed by exponentials of @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the size of the separation between two same subregions @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , the holographic mutual information ( hmi ) can be decomposed as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 appears in the limit of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are correction terms suppressed by exponentials of @xmath5 and powers of @xmath15 @xcite . obviously , the decomposition reveals that hmi can capture some important information of hee .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the entanglement entropy in the thermalization process of the strongly coupled field theory following a global quench .",
    "the holographic thermalization related to the global quench have been discussed in bhattacharyya0904,quench , arrastia10,aparicio11,johnson11,bala11,keranen11,galante1205,hubeny1302,liuwenbiao .",
    "we will adapt the simple vaidya model arrastia10,aparicio11,johnson11,bala11,keranen11,galante1205,hubeny1302,liuwenbiao , which describes a homogeneous falling thin shell of null dust and is a good quantitative approximation of the background generated by the perturbation of a time - dependent scalar field @xcite and of the model of ref . @xcite . among many interesting properties of holographic thermalization that have been found in term of the vaidya model",
    ", it was observed that the evolution of hee includes an intermediate stage during which it is a simple linear function of time .",
    "the linear regime is not obvious when @xmath5 is small , but it will be when @xmath5 increases .",
    "this result matches well with the behavior seen in d=2 cfts @xcite .",
    "also it is consistent with the evolution of coarse - grained entropy in nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "there , it has been known that the linear growth rate of coarse - grained entropy is generally described by the kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate @xcite . in classical 4-dim su(2 ) lattice gauge theory , the kolmogorov - sinai entropy rate is shown to be an extensive quantity @xcite .",
    "for strongly coupled field theory with gravity dual , it has been found @xcite that the growth rate of hee density in d=2 cfts is also nearly volume - independent for small boundary volumes . for large volumes",
    ", however , the growth rate of hee approaches a constant limit .",
    "one of the main motivations of this paper is to ask : whether the linear time growth of hee with a volume - independent rate is the dynamical correspondence of the sub - leading area law of hee captured by hmi in the static background ?",
    "more simply , can the dynamical hmi capture the constant growth rate ? to answer this question , we address the following work .    at first , we analytically prove that it is true for d=2 cfts",
    ". then we check it using semi - analytic methods . furthermore , by implementing a time - consumed numerical computation , we can obtain the hee with the large enough volume to demonstrate the constant growth rate of dynamical hee in the d=3 relativistic cft , the d=3 non - relativistic scale - invariant theory and the dual theory of 5-dimensional ( -dim ) gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity .",
    "also , the linear growth with a constant slope is shown in the time evolution of hmi .",
    "it deserves to note that we need to find a vaidya metric in asymptotically lifshitz spacetime for studying the non - relativistic theory and the formula of hee of gb gravity has the nontrivial correction ( not same as the wald entropy ) to the one of einstein gravity fursaev06,gb1,myers1101,sinha1305 .    on the other hand , it is well known that the interior of black holes is difficult to probe .",
    "so it is impressed that the holographic calculation of dynamical non - local observables involves the information behind the apparent horizon generated in the process of gravitational collapse arrastia10,aparicio11,johnson11,bala11,asplund11,basu12,buchel13,balami , tonni11 .",
    "recently , hartman and maldacena further isolated the origin of the linear growth of hee as arising from the growth of black hole interior measured along a special critical spatial slice @xcite .",
    "their result was obtained by studying the cfts with the initial states of thermofield double for thermal states and a particular pure state , which are dual to eternal black holes and the eternal black holes with an end of the world brane that cuts them in half , respectively .    motivated by the insight that relating the horizon interior to the linear growth of hee , the second aim of this paper is to study whether the interior of the apparent horizon along the extremal surface is also responsible for the linear growth of hee in  vaidya models .",
    "we demonstrate that the answer is affirmative at large @xmath5 in various holographic theories .",
    "thus we can present a very general result that in the process of holographic thermalization , the linear growth with a constant rate of ee can be captured by mi in the boundary and the horizon interior in the bulk .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we demonstrate that the hee has a linear growth regime when @xmath5 is large and the growth rate approaches a constant limit when @xmath5 increases . in sec .",
    "iii , the evolution of hmi is shown to contain the regime of the linear growth with the constant rate . in sec .",
    "iv , it is revealed that the extremal surfaces probing the interior of apparent horizons account for the linear growth of hee at large @xmath5 . in each section , we study the d=2 , d=3 relativistic cfts , the d=3 non - relativistic scale - invariant theory and the dual theory of 5-dim gb gravity , respectively . for d=2 , we will use analytic and semi - analytic methods . for other cases , only the numerical method is applicable .",
    "the conclusion and discussion are given in sec .",
    "v. we also add three appendix .",
    "one is to look for a vaidya metric in asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes .",
    "the second is to extend the decomposition of static hee and hmi in refs .",
    "@xcite to the case of gb gravity by numerical fitting . at last appendix",
    ", we study the extremal surface in the interior of event horizon .",
    "at the beginning , let us set a general frame that can accommodate all our interested holographic theories as special cases .",
    "we will study the thermalization processes of @xmath7-dim strongly coupled field theories modeled by a homogeneous falling thin shell of null dust in @xmath20-dim spacetime .",

    "the dynamical exponent @xmath28 reflects the scale invariance and the effective curvature radius of space can be given by @xmath29 .",
    "for three kinds of holographic theories that we are interested in - dim cfts , lifshitz gravity and gbgravity , respectively .",
    "] , the unspecified quantities in the metric are different but they are all restricted to be a vaidya spacetime with a massless shell .",

    ". we will be interested in the zero thickness limit , which means to set the energy deposition on the boundary as instantaneous .",

    "we also have interested in studying the holographic thermalization of a 3-dim non - relativistic field theory dual to a simple lifshitz gravity @xcite , for which the static hmi has been studied in @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the holographic entanglement entropy in a homogeneous falling shell background , which is dual to the strongly coupled field theory following a global quench . for d=2 conformal field theories </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that the entropy has a linear growth regime if the scale of the entangling region is large . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the growth rate approaches a constant when the scale increases . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate analytically that this behavior is directly related to the part of minimal area surface probing the interior of apparent horizons in the bulk , as well as the mutual information between two disjoint rectangular subsystems in the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show numerically that all the results are universal for the d=3 conformal field theory , the non - relativistic scale - invariant theory and the dual theory of gauss - bonnet gravity . </S>"
