    "the energy loss of ion beams and the related processes in magnetized plasmas are important in many areas of physics such as transport , heating and magnetic confinement of thermonuclear plasmas .",
    "the range of the related topics includes ultracold plasmas @xcite , cold electron setups used for ion beam cooling @xcite , as well as many very dense systems involved in magnetized target fusions @xcite , or inertial confinement fusion .",
    "this latter thermonuclear scheme presently advocates a highly regarded fast ignition scenario @xcite , based on femtolaser produced proton or heavier ion beams impinging a precompressed capsule containing a thermonuclear fuel @xcite in it .",
    "then , the magnetic field @xmath0 values up to @xmath1  g may be reached in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "such a topic is also of intense astrophysical concern @xcite .",
    "these interaction geometries highlight low ion velocity slowing down ( livsd ) as playing a fundamental role in asserting the confining capabilities and thermonuclear burn efficiency in dense and strongly magnetized media .    for a theoretical description of the energy loss of ions in a plasma ,",
    "there exist two standard approaches .",
    "the dielectric linear response ( lr ) treatment considers the ion as a perturbation of the target plasma and the stopping is caused by the polarization of the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "it is generally valid if the ion couples weakly to the target .",
    "alternatively , the stopping is calculated as the result of the energy transfers in successive binary collisions ( bcs ) between the ion and the electrons @xcite . here",
    "it is essential to consider appropriate approximations for the screening of the coulomb potential by the plasma @xcite . however",
    ", significant gaps between these approaches involve the crucial ion stopping along magnetic field @xmath2 and perpendicular to it .",
    "in particular , at high @xmath0 values , the bc predicts a vanishingly parallel energy loss , which remains at variance with the nonzero lr one . also challenging bc - lr discrepancies persist in the transverse direction , especially for vanishingly small ion projectile velocity @xmath3 when the friction coefficient contains an anomalous term diverging logarithmically at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in general when @xmath3 is smaller than target electron thermal velocity @xmath5 , the ratio @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the stopping power ( sp ) , usually monitors a linear stopping profile for highly ionized plasma with @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , particularly in the absence of any relevant experimental data , is to test various theoretical methods against comprehensive numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the latter exhibit high a level of numerical noise at large magnetic fields , and in the @xmath4 limit , while keeping a plasma coupling below unity , which is precisely the domain of many important applications of current interest .    with this background we report on a theoretical study of energy loss of a slow - velocity ion in a magnetized classical plasma through a linear response approach which is constructed such that it conserves particle number .",
    "broadly speaking , there are two objectives of this paper .",
    "the first objective is to use the bhatnagar - krook - gross ( bgk ) approach based on the boltzmann - poisson equations for a collisional and magnetized classical plasma which is treated as a one - component plasma ( ocp ) .",
    "we use this approach to derive the dielectric function in a number - conserving manner and use this dielectric function to calculate various aspects of energy loss of an ion moving in the plasma .",
    "this is done in sec .",
    "[ sec : s2 ] .",
    "we would like to see how number - conservation and damping ( due to collisions ) affect the stopping power of an ion in a low velocity range , i.e. , for a slow ion .",
    "we should mention that for a colliisonal quantum plasma , e.g. , a degenerate electron gas ( deg ) without magnetic field , mermin @xcite and das @xcite considered the equation of motion for a single - particle density matrix and derived the dielectric function in a number - conserving approach and in random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the main part of our first objective is to see to what extent the bgk approach can address the sp of a slow ion in a magnetized one - component classical plasma .",
    "we will show that number conservation and collisions in such ocp have interesting and experimentally observable effects on low - velocity sp .",
    "now , one may expect various collision mechanisms in a magnetized plasma .",
    "because of their importance we have separately dealt with them in sec .  [",

    "[ sec : s4 ] we present detailed calculations of low - velocity sp in the bgk approach .",
    "although the lr is normally used to calculate the sp of a fast ion , we show that for the bgk model one can obtain useful and insightful results for low - velocity within the lr theory .",
    "a second objective of our paper is to compare and contrast our theoretical results with those obtained through a different method .",
    "the latter is specifically aimed at a low - velocity sp which is expressed in terms of velocity - velocity correlation and hence to a diffusion coefficient .",
    "we refer to dufty and berkovsky ( db ) @xcite for an exposition of this method . the later part of sec .",
