    "when the positions of galaxies are mapped in redshift space , the nature of the large - scale structure seen in the maps is `` frothy '' or `` bubbly '' .",
    "voids  regions in which there are few or no galaxies  fill much of the map .",
    "the galaxies exist mainly in thin filaments or sheets that lie between the voids .",
    "comparison of the observed pattern of voids with that predicted by a given model of structure formation is potentially a very powerful test for acceptance or rejection of that model .",
    "unfortunately , the differences between models are often subtle",
    ". many models for structure formation predict a bubbly galaxy distribution . in the gravitational instability scenario , regions that are originally underdense expand faster than the hubble flow @xcite . as underdense regions expand , they become more nearly spherical @xcite . whether voids in the actual universe are viewed as isolated spherical structures or as a space - filling foam depends on the density level at which voids are defined @xcite .",
    "van de weygaert & van kampen ( 1993 ) did extensive studies of voids in constrained gaussian fields , finding that voids become nearly spherical in their very underdense inner regions , while their boundary regions remain more irregular .",
    "if structure grows via gravitational instability , then the size and shape of voids depends on the initial power spectrum @xmath3 for the density fluctuations and on the density parameter @xmath4 . in an open universe ,",
    "void evolution stops when @xmath5 ; thereafter , the void network simply expands along with the hubble flow @xcite . at a given epoch ,",
    "the mean void radius is proportional to the nonlinearity scale @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the full distribution of void sizes , however , depends on the shape of the spectrum @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if we know with absolute accuracy the position of galaxies in real space , we could use the spectrum of void sizes to place constraints on the initial power spectrum @xmath3 .",
    "however , measuring the distances to galaxies is difficult ; it is much easier to measure their redshifts .",
    "consequently , practical studies of the properties of voids must take place in redshift space rather than real space .",
    "if all galaxies smoothly followed the hubble flow , with no peculiar velocities , and if the hubble constant @xmath7 were truly constant with time , then the mapping between real space and redshift space would be linear .",
    "generally , though , the hubble constant changes with time , and structure that is isotropic in real space becomes distorted along the line of sight in redshift space , with the amount of distortion increasing with redshift @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "potentially , distortions in the shapes of voids in redshift space can provide an estimate of the deceleration parameter @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the distortions that result from cosmological effects become large only when @xmath10 . in the nearby universe , where @xmath11 , the dominant contribution to distortions from redshift space comes from the peculiar velocity of galaxies .",
    "@xcite demonstrated , for instance , that in two - dimensional simulations with @xmath12 , the characteristic void size is larger in redshift space than in real space .",
    "redshift space distortions can also , in principle , be harnessed to measure @xmath13 , the density in nonrelativistic matter @xcite .",
    "one goal of this paper is to extend the analysis of @xcite to three - dimensional simulations with more realistic cdm power spectra .",
    "analyzing the properties of voids first requires a definition of what a void is .",
    "some of the statistics used to describe voids define a void as a region totally devoid of galaxies .",
    "the void probability function ( vpf ) is one such statistic ; the vpf @xmath14 is the probability that a randomly positioned sphere of volume @xmath15 contains no galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the random dilution of a point process ( selecting only a fraction of all the galaxies in the universe , for instance ) , although it leaves the correlation function unchanged , strongly affects vpf @xcite .",
    "thus , from a practical viewpoint , it makes more sense to define a void which is underdense with respect to the average number density of galaxies .",
    "@xcite , for instance , use the underdense probability function ( upf ) .",
    "the upf @xmath16 can be defined as the probability that a randomly positioned sphere of volume @xmath15 contains a number density of galaxies less than or equal to @xmath17 times the average number density of galaxies in the entire survey .",
    "we will follow @xcite in setting a void threshold of @xmath18 , matching the density contrast of the largest voids in the cfa redshift survey @xcite .",
    "one advantage of the upf over the vpf is that it is relatively insensitive to the sparseness with which the galaxies are sampled . in this paper",
    ", we will explicitly compare the upf and vpf for different galaxy sampling densities .",
    "in addition to statistical measurements such as the vpf and upf , algorithms exist that identify individual voids within a sample @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing a spectrum of void sizes , these void - detection algorithms also enable us to specify the location and shape of individual voids . in this paper",
    ", we first use an algorithm ( an extension of the two - dimensional algorithm of ryden [ 1995 ] ) which defines voids as non - overlapping underdense spheres .",
    "although this algorithm is conceptually simple , it has the disadvantage of forcing voids to be spherical .",
    "thus , we also employ a more sophisticated algorithm , based on that of aikio & mhnen ( 1998 ; am ) , which does not constrain voids to be any particular shape .",
    "the original am algorithm defines voids as empty regions ; our modification of the original defines voids as underdense regions . for the voids found by the modified am algorithm , we introduce an elongation statistic @xmath1 which measures whether the voids are stretched or squashed along the line of sight from the origin .",
    "just as with the upf and vpf , we also apply the void - detection algorithms to different sampling densities of the same survey .",
    "our studies of void properties in numerical simulations will permit a more effective interpretation and understanding of voids in future three - dimensional redshift surveys .    in section 2 , we describe the n - body simulation analyzed in this paper . in section 3 ,",
    "we examine the statistical properties of voids , as given by the vpf and upf . in section 4",
    ", we apply void - detection algorithms to the simulations . finally ,",
    "in section 5 , we analyze the effects of peculiar velocities and galaxy sampling density on void properties , and discuss implications for future work .",
    "the simulation used for testing in this paper was done using a particle - mesh ( pm ) n - body simulation .",
    "the pm method is quite fast , and with a mean particle density of one per simulation cell , represents the maximum resolution that can be achieved without introducing two - body scattering that decouples the result from its initial conditions on small scales @xcite .",
    "the simulation used here had 256@xmath19 particles on a 256@xmath19 mesh .",
    "initial conditions were generated by fast fourier transform with random phase perturbations . since behavior at high density peaks is not of interest to us in our study of voids , the simulations were begun with an rms density of 0.25 at the resolution limit .",
    "the simulations were evolved until the rms overdensity inside a randomly located sphere of radius @xmath20 was @xmath21 .",
    "a matter - dominated friedman - robertson - walker background density was assumed , with the cosmological constant @xmath22 set equal to zero . since",
    "nonlinear modes are filtered out , and the dynamical effect of nonzero @xmath23 is well - understood in perturbation theory @xcite , we did not use nonzero values of @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath13 , the dimensionless matter density , was taken to be @xmath24 .",
    "the box size was take to be 1536 mpc and the hubble constant @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the box size in redshift space corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "formally , in the simulation @xmath27 only sets an overall timescale ; since both the expansion rate and the particle velocities scale with @xmath27 , the redshift space appearance does not change with @xmath27 , only its overall scale .",
    "the initial power spectrum we assume is a cold dark matter ( cdm ) spectrum , in which the parameter @xmath28 determines the shape of the spectrum .",
    "smaller values of @xmath28 are favored today , because they push the turnover in the slope of the power spectrum to large scales , in better agreement with observations .",
    "to test our void - finding algorithms , we use @xmath29 .",
    "normally , @xmath28 is taken to be @xmath30 , as the turnover scale is set by the horizon at the end of the radiation - dominated era . however , we break this assumed coupling and take @xmath28 as a free parameter descriptive of the spectral shape . thus",
    ", our model corresponds to what is sometimes called @xmath0cdm .",
    "the number density of mass points in the simulation , @xmath31 , corresponds to the number density of galaxies with @xmath32 , assuming that the luminosity function of galaxies is a schechter function with slope @xmath33 and normalization @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to investigate the dependence of void properties on the sampling density of a galaxy survey .",
    "thus , from the initial numerical simulation , we have created three different samples , corresponding to volume - limited surveys with different luminosity cutoffs . to create our densest sample , we randomly selected a fraction @xmath35 of the initial mass points , in order to match the number density of galaxies with @xmath36 .",
    "for the next densest sample , we selected a fraction @xmath37 of the mass points , to match the number density of galaxies with @xmath2 . finally , for our least dense sample , we selected a fraction @xmath38 of the mass points , to match the density of galaxies with @xmath39 .",
    "note that by randomly selecting galaxies in this way , we are assuming that galaxies are unbiased with respect to the mass distribution , and that luminosity segregation does not exist .",
    "we wish to study only the effects of different sampling densities , and not the more subtle effects of bias .    for each sampling density , we create two mock galaxy surveys , one without peculiar velocities ( which we will call the `` real space '' survey ) and one with peculiar velocities ( the `` redshift space '' survey ) .",
    "the mock surveys are spheres with a radius of 480 mpc , or @xmath40 in redshift units .",
    "note that in a flat @xmath24 universe , a galaxy with @xmath41 located at @xmath42 will have an apparent magnitude of @xmath43 , assuming @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "for a typical galaxy color of @xmath45 , this roughly corresponds to the flux limit @xmath46 expected for the galaxy redshift sample of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "a slice through the @xmath2 `` real space '' survey is shown in figure 1a ; a slice through the @xmath2 `` redshift space '' survey is shown in figure 1b .",
    "the void probability function , or vpf @xcite has been a widely used statistic for measuring the characteristic size of voids .",
    "the vpf @xmath14 is defined as the probability that a randomly located sphere of volume @xmath15 contains no galaxies .",
    "the vpf has been applied to numerical simulations @xcite and to redshift surveys @xcite .",
    "the vpf for the simulation studied in this paper is given in the left - hand panels of figure 2 .",
    "the volumes plotted are in redshift units ; to convert to physical units , multiply by @xmath47 . in each panel ,",
    "the solid line shows the vpf in real space , and the dotted line shows the vpf in redshift space .",
    "the effect of peculiar velocity distortions is to increase the void probability at a given volume @xmath15 .",
    "a comparison of the vpf for the different sampling densities , however , vividly illustrates the very strong dependence of the vpf on the mean interparticle spacing . to illustrate ,",
    "let s define a characteristic void volume @xmath48 as the volume for which @xmath49 .",
    "for a poisson distribution of points , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mean number density , and thus @xmath52 . for our @xmath36 sample , @xmath53 ; for our @xmath2 sample , @xmath54 ; and for our sparse @xmath39 sample , @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the voids in the simulation are larger than those in a poisson distribution of equal @xmath51 , but it is still approximately true that the characteristic void size ( defining voids as totally empty volumes ) is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "the dependence of characteristic void size on the sample density @xmath51 is reduced if we use the underdense probability function ( upf ) to measure the statistics of voids .",
    "the upf @xmath57 is defined as the probability that a randomly located sphere of volume @xmath15 contains a number density of galaxies that is less than @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , and @xmath51 is the mean number density of galaxies in the sample .",
    "( in a flux - limited survey , we can generalize the upf so that @xmath57 is the probability that a sphere of volume @xmath15 located at a distance @xmath60 from the origin contains a number density of galaxies that is less than @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mean number density of detected galaxies at @xmath60 . ) following previous work @xcite , we will set our density threshold at @xmath63 .",
    "the upf for the simulation studied in this paper is given in the right - hand column of figure 2 ; in each panel , the solid line shows the upf in real space and the dotted line shows the upf in redshift space .",
    "again , the effect of peculiar velocity distortions is to increase the probability of finding a void of volume @xmath15 . for volumes @xmath64 ,",
    "the upf and the vpf are identical , since such a small volume can only fall below the density threshold if it contains no galaxies . in general , a sphere of volume @xmath15 will be underdense if it contains at most @xmath65 galaxies , where @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath65 is small , the upf shows discreteness effects , visible as the sawtooth pattern in figure 2 ; the upf jumps upward whenever @xmath15 is an integral multiple of @xmath67 .    the characteristic void size @xmath68 is defined as the volume for which @xmath69 .",
    "( the choice of @xmath70 as the defining probability is somewhat arbitrary ; however , because of the rapid decline of @xmath71 at large volumes , the exact value of @xmath71 is not crucial . ) for our dense @xmath36 sample , @xmath72 ; for the @xmath2 sample , @xmath73 ; for the sparse @xmath39 sample , @xmath74 .",
    "the inclusion of peculiar velocity distortions increases @xmath68 by a factor which ranges from @xmath75 for the densest sample to @xmath76 for the sparsest sample .",
    "although the dependence of the underdense void size @xmath68 on @xmath51 is less strong than that of @xmath48 , it is not true that @xmath68 is independent of @xmath51 for plausible sampling densities .",
    "thus , in a flux - limited survey , where the measured @xmath51 decreases with distance from the origin , the characteristic void size @xmath68 will increase with distance .",
    "the upf gives a statistical measure of the number and size of voids in a given galaxy distribution . frequently , however , it is useful to identify individual voids instead of simply giving a statistical description .",
    "many different algorithms have been used to detect and identify individual voids @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate two void - detection algorithms that are distinguished by their ease of use and clarity of conception .",
    "the first algorithm , based on that of @xcite , identifies voids as nonoverlapping spheres ; we will call this the `` sphere algorithm '' . the second algorithm , based on that of aikio and mhonen ( 1998 ; am ) permits voids to be nonspherical ; we will call this the `` am algorithm '' .",
    "both void - detection algorithms start by defining a continuous scalar field @xmath77 within the galaxy survey . at any location @xmath78",
    ", @xmath79 is defined as the radius of the largest sphere centered on @xmath78 within which the average galaxy density is equal to @xmath80 . to implement the `` sphere algorithm '' , first locate the global maximum of @xmath79 within the survey ; call the location of this maximum @xmath81 .",
    "this is the center of the largest spherical void in the sample , which has a radius @xmath82 . to find the second largest void ,",
    "find the point @xmath83 for which @xmath79 is maximized , subject to the constraint that @xmath84 the point @xmath83 is then the center of the second - largest spherical void , which has radius @xmath85 .",
    "in other words , the second - largest void is the largest underdense sphere that does nt overlap the largest void .",
    "additional voids are found by an iterative process .",
    "the @xmath86 largest void is located at the position @xmath87 for which @xmath88 is maximized , subject to the constraint that @xmath89 for @xmath90 .    in practice , we compute the values of @xmath79 on a cartesian grid superimposed on the galaxy distribution . for the simulation used in this paper , the grid spacing we used was @xmath91 in redshift units ( @xmath92 in physical units ) .",
    "this is 0.8 times the resolution of the original numerical simulation .",
    "using a grid very much finer than that of the original simulation is pointless , since there is no information on such small scales .",
    "the computed value of @xmath79 for each grid point was forbidden to be larger than the distance from the grid point to the sample boundary at z=0.12 .",
    "we then located the spherical voids , using the algorithm outlined above , subject to the additional constraint that the void centers lie on grid points .",
    "since the discreteness of the superimposed grid creates errors of order @xmath93 in the location of void centers , we halt the void - detection algorithm when @xmath94 .    to emphasize the difference between the properties of totally empty voids and underdense voids , we implemented the sphere algorithm twice , once with @xmath95 , and once with @xmath63 . to illustrate the voids found with the sphere algorithm , figure 3 shows a slice through the underdense spheres found in the @xmath96 sample , setting @xmath18 .",
    "figure 3a shows the spherical voids found in real space ( without peculiar velocity distortions ) and figure 3b shows the spherical voids found in redshift space ( with peculiar velocity distortions ) .    to show the spectrum of void sizes found with the sphere algorithm , figure 4 plots @xmath97 , the fraction of the total volume of the sample found in spherical voids with volume @xmath98 .",
    "the right column of figure 4 displays @xmath99 , the fraction of the total volume found in voids with underdensity @xmath18 .",
    "for comparison , the left column of figure 4 gives @xmath100 , the fraction of the total volume found in totally empty voids .",
    "the solid line in each panel gives the distribution in real space , and the dotted line gives the distribution in redshift space .",
    "the left column of figure 4 demonstrates , as in the case of the vpf , that the characteristic size of empty voids depends strongly on the density @xmath51 of the sample .",
    "because of this undesired feature , we will only examine in detail the properties of underdense voids .",
    "a characteristic void size can be found , following the practice of @xcite , by computing the volume - weighted mean void size , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the volume of the @xmath103 largest void , and the total number of voids is @xmath104 .",
    "alternatively , we can define a characteristic void size @xmath105 which is the void volume such that @xmath106 percent of the total volume in the sample is contained in voids of size @xmath105 or bigger .",
    "the characteristic void sizes @xmath107 and @xmath108 are given in table 1 for underdense voids in samples of different number density , with and without peculiar velocities .",
    "the characteristic size of spherical voids ( whether defined as @xmath107 or @xmath108 ) increases in going from real space to redshift space .",
    "the more densely sampled the survey , the greater the increase in void size . for the @xmath39 sample ,",
    "@xmath107 increases by 43% in going from real space to redshift space , and @xmath108 increases by 40% . for the @xmath36 sample ,",
    "@xmath107 increases by 88% in going from real space to redshift space , and @xmath108 by 155% .",
    "although the sphere algorithm gives a rough estimate of the spectrum of void sizes , the volumes of the voids found by this algorithm will generally be underestimates of the `` true '' void size .",
    "that is , if a sample contains an empty region surrounded by a continuous , well - defined , extremely overdense wall , the void found by the sphere algorithm will be the largest sphere that can be inscribed within the wall .",
    "the remaining empty space within the void wall will then be iteratively filled with smaller and smaller spheres . a more flexible algorithm  one which does nt impose the artificial constraint that voids are spherical",
    " should give a more accurate measure of void size .",
    "in addition to underestimating the size of voids , the sphere algorithm gives no hint of the true void shape . in two dimensions ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated the shapes of voids by fitting ellipses to the underdense region .",
    "each void was then characterized by an axis ratio @xmath109 and a position angle @xmath110 in addition to its area @xmath111 and position @xmath112 .",
    "extending this algorithm to three dimensions by fitting ellipsoids to the underdense regions becomes a computationally daunting task .",
    "each ellipsoidal void must be characterized by two axis ratios and three euler angles in addition to its volume @xmath15 and position @xmath113 .",
    "the introduction of additional parameters makes the search through parameter space far more time - consuming .",
    "thus , instead of approximating the shape of voids by fitting ellipsoids to them , we adopted the more flexible scheme of aikio & mahnn ( 1998 ; am ) .    to implement the am algorithm , we start with the field @xmath79 as defined on the cartesian grid that we have superimposed on the galaxy survey . if the grid spacing is @xmath93 , then each grid point can be thought of as being at the center of a cubical `` elementary cell '' of volume @xmath114 .",
    "we identify the local maxima of @xmath79 on the grid as being those points which have values of @xmath79 greater than that of their 26 closest neighbors ( the 6 points at a distance @xmath93 , the 12 points at a distance @xmath115 , and the 8 points at a distance @xmath116 ) .",
    "we label the local maxima we find as @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the total number of maxima located .",
    "the am algorithm assigns every elementary cell to a `` subvoid '' associated with some maximum @xmath122 . to discover",
    "which subvoid a particular elementary cell belongs to , a `` climbing algorithm '' is used . for a elementary cell @xmath106",
    ", we compute the gradient in @xmath79 to each of the neighboring cells .",
    "we then `` climb '' to elementary cell @xmath123 for which the gradient has the largest ( positive ) value .",
    "the climbing continues from cell to cell until a local maximum @xmath122 is reached .",
    "the cell @xmath106 ( and every other cell along the climbing route ) is then assigned to the subvoid of maximum @xmath122 . in this way , every elementary cell is assigned to a subvoid , and each maximum @xmath122 has an associated subvoid which consists of at least one elementary cell . once every elementary cell is assigned to a subvoid , the subvoids are joined together into larger voids .",
    "the subvoids associated with maxima @xmath122 and @xmath124 are members of the same void if the distance between @xmath122 and @xmath124 is less than both @xmath125 and @xmath126 . using this criterion ,",
    "all the subvoids are grouped into voids ; some voids contain a single subvoid , while others contain many subvoids linked together in a friends - of - friends percolation .",
    "the am algorithm and its implementation is described in more detail in the original paper by @xcite ; our modification is to use the underdensity field @xmath79 , where am restricted themselves to the case @xmath127 .",
    "figure 5a shows a slice through the underdense voids in the @xmath2 sample , without the inclusion of peculiar velocity distortions .",
    "the am algorithm was used with a density threshold @xmath18 . in each panel of figure 5",
    ", an elementary cell is colored white if it belongs to the same void as its 26 nearest neighboring cells ; it is colored black if one or more of its neighbors belongs to a different void .",
    "figure 5b shows a slice through the underdense voids in the @xmath2 sample , this time with the effects of peculiar velocities included .",
    "the volume @xmath15 of an individual void found by the am algorithm can be found by simply adding together the volume @xmath114 of the elementary cells which it contains .",
    "the full spectrum of void sizes in a particular galaxy sample is given by @xmath97 , the fraction of the total volume of the sample found in voids with volume @xmath98 .",
    "the left column of figure 6 shows @xmath100 , the distribution of void volumes using the original algorithm of am , in which @xmath95 . the right column of figure 6 displays @xmath99 ,",
    "using our usual underdense criterion , @xmath18 .",
    "some properties of the am voids are the similar to those of the spherical voids found earlier .",
    "for instance , the left column of figure 6 shows that the characteristic size of empty am voids ( just like those of spherical voids ) is strongly dependent on the density @xmath51 of the sample . also , peculiar velocities increase the characteristic size of am voids as well as of spherical voids . using the am algorithm with @xmath63 , the volume - weighted mean void size @xmath107 and the characteristic size @xmath108",
    "are given in table 1 .",
    "for the sparsely sampled survey ( @xmath128 ) , @xmath107 increases by 58% in going from real space to redshift space , and @xmath108 increases by 66% .",
    "for the densely sampled survey ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath107 increases by 79% in going from real space to redshift space , and @xmath108 increases by 82% .",
    "in addition , am voids as well as spherical voids are larger at lower sampling densities .",
    "given a density threshold of @xmath18 , the characteristic void size ( either @xmath107 or @xmath108 ) for the sparsely sampled survey ( @xmath128 ) is 2.5 times that of the densely sampled survey ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "one important difference between the voids found by the am algorithm and those found by the sphere algorithm is that the am voids are larger . at all sampling densities",
    ", it is found that @xmath129 .",
    "the ratio @xmath130 ranges from @xmath131 for the @xmath132 survey through @xmath133 for the @xmath2 survey to @xmath134 for the @xmath135 .",
    "thus , the answer to the seemingly innocuous question , `` how large is a typical void ? '' depends not only on the sampling density of the galaxy survey and on whether the survey is done in real space or in redshift space , but also on the void - finding algorithm used and on the definition adopted for the typical void size .",
    "another important difference between the voids found by the am algorithm and those found by the sphere algorithm is that the am voids are not compelled to be spherical .",
    "hence the shapes of the am voids can be used as a measure of the shape of voids in the galaxy distribution .",
    "it is of particular interest to discover whether voids are distorted along the line of sight from the observer at the origin . at relatively small redshifts ( @xmath136 ) ,",
    "the dominant source of distortion in redshift maps is the peculiar velocities of galaxies .",
    "in examining two - dimensional simulations with power spectra @xmath137 , @xcite found only a mild tendency for voids to be distorted or compressed along the line of sight . with an @xmath138 power spectrum ,",
    "the largest voids were slightly elongated along the line of sight ; with an @xmath139 spectrum , voids were slightly compressed along the line of sight .    to find whether the am voids are preferentially elongated or compressed along the line of sight , we begin by computing the moments of the voids . if a void contains @xmath121 elementary cells , with the center of the @xmath103 cell at @xmath140 , the moments of the void can be computed as @xmath141 the `` center of mass '' of the void , weighting all elementary cells equally , is at @xmath142 . for a given void",
    ", we can create a new coordinate system , with its origin at @xmath142 , with its @xmath143 axis passing through the location of the observer , and with its @xmath144 and @xmath145 axis perpendicular to the @xmath143 axis .",
    "if we know the coordinates @xmath140 of a mass element in the old coordinate system ( centered on the observer ) , we can compute the coordinates @xmath146 in the new coordinate system ( centered on the void center ) .",
    "a dimensionless measure of a void s elongation or compression along the line of sight is @xmath147 the quantity @xmath1 has some useful properties .",
    "its denominator is independent of the orientation of the coordinate system ; it s simply the mean square distance of all the elementary cells from the void center . for a void of arbitrary shape ,",
    "the mean value of @xmath1 , averaged over all viewing angles , is @xmath148 .",
    "thus , for a population of voids oriented randomly with respect to the observer , we expect the average value of @xmath1 to be 1 .",
    "a value @xmath149 indicates that a void is elongated along the line of sight ; a value @xmath150 indicates that a void is compressed along the line of sight . for any void , in any orientation , @xmath151 . as an example , consider a triaxial ellipsoid with principal axes of length @xmath152 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath1 for this ellipsoid occurs when the long axis is aligned with the line of sight from the observer to the ellipsoid s center . in this case , @xmath153 the minimum value of @xmath1 occurs when the short axis is aligned with the line of sight . in this case , @xmath154    for the voids found by the am algorithm , the denominator of @xmath1 can be written as @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 the numerator can be written as @xmath158 \\ .\\ ] ] to compute the distribution of @xmath1 as a function of void volume @xmath15 , we first identify voids using the am algorithm with a density threshold @xmath18 ; to eliminate distortions caused by the artificial boundary conditions at @xmath159 , we consider only those voids at redshifts @xmath160 . the mean , @xmath161 , and the standard deviation , @xmath162 , of @xmath1 for the voids found in this way are plotted in figure 7 , as a function of void volume @xmath15 .",
    "the values of @xmath161 and @xmath162 are computed in bins containing 400 voids apiece .",
    "thus , the expected error in the mean value of @xmath1 for each bin is @xmath163 .",
    "the value of @xmath161 indicates whether voids are preferentially oriented with respect to the line of sight ; the value of @xmath162 is a measure of the intrinsic asphericity of the voids .    in the left column of figure 7",
    ", the shape of voids is measured in real space , where there should be no preferential distortions along the line of sight .",
    "indeed , @xmath161 is not significantly different from unity for voids of all sizes and at all sampling densities : in all cases , @xmath164",
    ". there is , however , a significant trend in the standard deviation of @xmath1 .",
    "as voids get larger , @xmath162 gets smaller , decreasing from @xmath165 at @xmath166 to @xmath167 at @xmath168 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that large voids are more nearly spherical than small voids .    in the right column of figure 7",
    ", the shape of voids is measured in redshift space , where the distortions due to peculiar velocities may cause systematic distortions along the line of sight . at sufficiently high sampling density ( the @xmath2 and @xmath36 samples ) ,",
    "large voids are significantly elongated along the line of sight ( @xmath169 ) . in the @xmath2 sample , @xmath169 for volumes @xmath170 . in the @xmath36 sample ,",
    "@xmath169 for volumes @xmath171 ; the greatest deviation of @xmath161 from unity is at @xmath172 , where @xmath173 .",
    "we conclude that the distortions along the line of sight caused by peculiar velocities are measurable by the am algorithm only when the sampling density is sufficiently high ( corresponding to a limiting galaxy luminosity of @xmath174 or fainter ) . for our initial cdm power spectrum ,",
    "voids with @xmath175 show a significant tendency to be elongated along the line of sight by peculiar velocities .",
    "in examining the large scale structure of the universe , studies of overdense regions ( clusters and superclusters ) are usefully complemented by studies of underdense regions , or voids .",
    "the properties of voids , such as their volumes and shapes , depend on how voids are defined . since the literature contains many different void definitions and void - finding algorithms ,",
    "direct comparison of void properties found in different studies is a risky business .",
    "the vpf , @xmath14 , depends strongly on the number density @xmath51 of galaxies in the survey .",
    "although the upf , @xmath176 , depends less strongly on sampling density than the vpf , it is still true that the characteristic void size @xmath177 depends on the sampling density @xmath51 , with a higher density yielding a smaller characteristic void size .",
    "thus , in a flux - limited survey , where the mean density of detected galaxies , @xmath178 , decreases with redshift , using a threshold density @xmath179 will produce a characteristic void size that increases with increasing redshift .",
    "this will be an artifact of the decreasing sampling density at large redshift , and does not reflect a change in the underlying large scale structure . in determining how the properties of voids depend on redshift , it is more prudent to extract a volume - limited sample from the data before applying a void statistic like the upf or a void - finding algorithm .    of the void - finding algorithms outlined in this paper , the `` sphere '' algorithm has the virtue of ( relative ) simplicity .",
    "however , its restriction that all voids must be spherical leads to an underestimate of void size and does not permit us to measure the distortions of voids caused by peculiar velocities .",
    "adapting the algorithm of @xcite , we were able to determine more accurately the sizes of underdense voids .",
    "as in two - dimensional simulations @xcite , the effect of peculiar velocities is to increase the characteristic void size .",
    "the am algorithm also permits us to measure the elongation of voids along the line of sight . in real space",
    ", it is found that large voids are intrinsically more nearly spherical than smaller voids .",
    "this can be regarded as a manifestation of the tendency for large voids within a bubbly structure to expand and become more nearly spherical at the expense of their smaller neighbors @xcite . in redshift space ,",
    "large voids are seen , for the cdm spectrum used in our simulations , to have a slight but statistically significant tendency to be elongated along the line of sight .",
    "note , however , that the void distortions can only be detected at a sufficiently high sampling density .",
    "future redshift surveys such as that provided by the sloan digital sky survey will provide sufficiently high galaxy densities and a large enough number of voids to accurately measure the peculiar velocity distortion of voids in the real universe . when deeper redshift surveys are available , the ( relatively small ) peculiar velocity distortions can be subtracted out to reveal the cosmological distortions resulting from the deceleration of the hubble expansion .",
