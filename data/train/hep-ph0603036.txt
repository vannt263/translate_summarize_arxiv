    "neutrino  electron scattering offers a clean probe into the standard model of particle physics as well as many of its extensions . `",
    "clean ' refers to the fact that this process is very well understood theoretically .",
    "there are no hadronic complications , so that the underlying electroweak physics ( including potential deviations from standard model expectations ) is directly accessible .",
    "it is therefore `` easy '' to use such reactions to test the consistency of the standard model ( sm ) , determine precision electroweak parameters , and look for signatures of new physics .",
    "when this is considered along with the large variety of natural and artificial sources that yield high - flux neutrino samples of multiple flavors over a vast energy range , it seems that neutrino ",
    "electron scattering provides an ideal laboratory for electroweak studies .",
    "this line of reasoning appears misleading when realistic considerations are made . while theoretically ideal , the study of neutrino  electron scattering is experimentally challenging due to its tiny cross - section , which forces one to pursue very intense sources and large targets .",
    "more serious is the fact that the neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering cross - section is generally three orders of magnitude larger and serves as a large potential source of background .",
    "naively , one may consider simply subtracting off such background statistically . in this case",
    ", the uncertainty induced by the subtraction is approximately @xmath1 times larger than the intrinsic statistical uncertainty of the signal ; clearly unacceptable for precision measurements .",
    "of course , this is a worst case scenario : experimental set - ups usually allow one to isolate the signal events by performing various `` cuts '' on the data .",
    "exactly how this is done depends on the energy and flavor of the incident neutrino beam , as well as on the details of the detector .",
    "the signal we concentrate on is a single forward electron with no other detector activity , and all detectors considered can distinguish , with varying degrees of success , electrons from various potential background sources .",
    "cuts on event timing , rate of energy loss in the detector , and threshold energy , to name a few , aid in this endeavor ( details are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxes ] ) .",
    "even with optimistic particle identification abilities , experiments must still account for irreducible backgrounds .",
    "this is particularly relevant in @xmath2 and @xmath3 sources , where the charged current neutrino  nucleon reaction @xmath4 can yield a final state that is often consistent with a single recoil electron .",
    "such backgrounds , however , can still be reduced by exploiting additional constraints .",
    "for example , electrons produced by neutrino ",
    "electron scattering are constrained by kinematics to have small transverse momenta @xmath5 , whereas the electron @xmath6 distribution in most background events is much broader , @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , an experiment with good @xmath6 resolution can significantly constrain this class of background events .",
    "after all available data analyzing resources are spent , one is ( hopefully ) left with a signal - dominated event sample .",
    "this being the case , the remaining beam - related background can be modeled and subtracted , inducing a ( much smaller ) statistical uncertainty on the final data sample .",
    "backgrounds related to other neutrino / radiation sources originating from extra - terrestrial , terrestrial , and artificial origins are typically controlled by introducing shielding and imposing clever @xmath6 , timing , and energy cuts .",
    "the resulting backgrounds and uncertainties will typically be small , and are therefore not considered here .",
    "finally , one must also account for other experimental systematic uncertainties in the final analysis , which may or may not dominate the sensitivity budget .",
    "these considerations imply that measurements of neutrino  electron elastic scattering can be limited mainly by statistics and uncertainties related to the neutrino source . in order to accumulate enough statistics ,",
    "one is required to commit to long running experiments with large detectors close to the neutrino source ; a practice that has proven fruitful in the recent past , but not sufficient to yield results competitive with other tests of electroweak physics .",
    "significant progress is expected to be made with the advent of improvements to the neutrino sources themselves , both in statistics and flux - normalization .",
    "currently existing sources that could be used for neutrino ",
    "elastic scattering purposes can be broadly classified as either reactors or conventional neutrino beams , and are both discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxes ] .",
    "these are still subject to some of the limitations described above , which , in some cases , prevent competitive electroweak `` precision '' measurements .",
    "recent progress in the development of two new classes of neutrino beams inspires the possibility of sidestepping these limitations and thereby testing the sm to unparalleled accuracy .",
    "neutrino factories and @xmath8-beams offer high luminosity neutrino beams with well - known energy spectra @xcite . here",
    ", we explore the potential of neutrino  electron scattering experiments in light of our enhanced knowledge of these sources .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "section [ sec : formalism ] reviews the relevant tree - level sm cross - sections , making brief mention of first order electroweak corrections .",
    "we then describe the various neutrino sources  reactors , conventional beams , @xmath8-beams and @xmath9-factories  used in our analysis . in each case",
    "we describe the energy spectrum , as well as uncertainties and backgrounds relevant to their associated neutrino ",
    "electron scattering experiments .",
    "section [ sec : results ] begins with a short description of our analysis , after which we review and motivate various observables and present our results on projected sensitivities to each within the context of future scattering experiments .",
    "specifically , we discuss measurements of the weak mixing angle @xmath10 , neutrino electromagnetic moments @xmath11 , neutrino neutral current left - handed couplings @xmath12 , and potential leptonic @xmath0 couplings .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : end ] with a summary of our results and an outlook for the future .",
    "we are interested in `` elastic '' neutrino  electron and antineutrino  electron scattering , characterized by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath9 stands for either a neutrino or an antineutrino state .",
    "note that , given our inability to identify the neutrino flavor after it has scattered off the target electron , there is no way of recognizing whether the scattered neutrino has the same lepton - flavor number or lepton number as the incoming one .",
    "the basis of this analysis is the differential event spectrum @xmath15 .",
    "this is the number of neutrino  electron elastic scattering events within the interval @xmath16 to @xmath17 of electron recoil kinetic energy .",
    "it involves the convolution of the differential cross - section @xmath18 and the incoming neutrino energy spectrum , @xmath19 .",
    "more than one neutrino flavor / helicity may be produced at each of the sources listed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxes ] and , since the final state electrons scattered from the various neutrino types are experimentally indistinguishable , their contributions must be incoherently added , leading to :    @xmath20    where ( # targets ) is the total number of target - electrons in the detector and ( time ) is the time duration of the experiment . in order to use eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rate_spectrum ] ) , we must know the flux and the cross - sections , along with their associated uncertainties .",
    "these are reviewed in the following subsections .",
    "for the remainder of this work , unless stated otherwise , we assume a @xmath21  ton detector of similar capabilities as miner@xmath9a @xcite , located @xmath21  m from the neutrino source , running for one year .. ]      in the standard model ( sm ) , all tree - level differential cross - sections for neutrino  electron scattering can be expressed as @xmath22 ,   \\label{eqn : dsig_dt_sm}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the fermi constant , @xmath24 is the energy of the incident neutrino and @xmath16 is the kinetic energy of the recoil electron .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are process - dependent constants that , within the sm , depend on the weak mixing angle @xmath10 , as tabulated in table  [ table : couplings ] .",
    "the cross term proportional to @xmath27 , the mass of the electron , is relevant for low energy applications , but is negligible in processes where @xmath28 .",
