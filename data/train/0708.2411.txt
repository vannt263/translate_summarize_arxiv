    "in the past several years , ultracold fermi gases have become a major focus of research on the interplay between cooper pairing , strong interactions , and reduced dimensionality .",
    "the appeal of this system stems from the fact that both the interaction strength and the geometry of the confinement potential can be controlled very precisely .",
    "feshbach resonances can be applied to tune the s - wave scattering length over a wide range of positive and negative values , which allows to investigate the crossover between a regime of bose - einstein condensed ( bec ) molecules@xcite and a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid@xcite .",
    "optical lattices are used to reduce the dimensionality of the system to 1d or 2d or to create a 3d optical lattice@xcite . moreover , since the amount of atoms of each species in a fermi mixture can also be controlled accurately , it has become possible to investigate the effect , on pair formation , of a population imbalance between the pairing partners@xcite .    in this contribution , we investigate the case of an imbalanced fermi superfluid in a one - dimensional optical potential . in previous work , it was shown that the gap and number equations can be solved exactly for an imbalanced two - dimensional fermi gas@xcite  this corresponds to a single layer in the optical potential . here",
    ", we will take into account the coupling between the different layers in the 1d lattice , and derive expressions for the tunneling amplitude and the critical velocity of the imbalanced fermi superfluid through the optical lattice .",
    "tunneling of a balanced fermi superfluid through a 1d optical lattice has been studied experimentally@xcite , as has the imbalanced 3d fermi superfluid@xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , tunneling of a imbalanced superfluid has not yet been investigated .",
    "the system that we study in this contribution consists of a fermi mixture with unequal amounts of two components , referred to as `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' .",
    "this is loaded into a one - dimensional optical lattice ( in the @xmath0-direction ) .",
    "the optical lattice is created by two counterpropagating laser beams with wave length @xmath1 and is modelled by a potential energy @xmath2 . under the influence of this lattice ,",
    "the gas forms a stack of typically a few hundred quasi-2d layers containing several thousands of atoms each .",
    "the confinement influences the way that interactions are taken into account .",
    "the interaction between atoms within one quasi-2d layer can be modelled by a 2d - pseudopotential @xmath3 where the strength @xmath4 depends on the energy of the scattering atoms through@xmath5   -\\int\\frac{d^{2}\\mathbf{k}}{(2\\pi)^{3}}\\frac{1}{(\\hbar k)^{2}/m - e+i\\varepsilon}.\\ ] ] here @xmath6 is the mass of the atoms , and @xmath7 is the energy of the bound state that always exists in two dimensions@xcite , given by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the ( 3d ) s - wave scattering length of the fermionic atoms , @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the goal of this contribution is to take into account the coupling between adjacent valleys of the optical potential .",
    "this coupling is due to tunneling of individual atoms from layer to layer and is characterised by the tunneling amplitude@xcite",
    "@xmath13   e^{-\\left (   \\lambda/4\\ell_{l}\\right )   ^{2}}.\\ ] ]",
    "we follow the path - integral approach , as applied by iskin and sa de melo @xcite for an imbalanced gas , and as applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the optical lattice .",
    "the action functional @xmath14 for the fermionic mixture in the optical lattice can be written as a path integral over the exponential of an action functional , consisting of the contributions @xmath15 of the _ individual layers _ and the contributions @xmath16 of _ tunneling _ between adjacent layers .",
    "that is , we write for the action @xmath17 , with the single - layer action@xmath18 and the tunneling action@xmath19 here , we use @xmath20 for the the 2d wave number * k * and the matsubara frequency @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the spin , so that @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the grassmann variables for the fermionic fields in layer @xmath25 .",
    "the system parameters are the interaction strength @xmath4 , the tunneling amplitude @xmath26 , and the chemical potentials @xmath27 that fix the amounts of spin - up and spin - down particles .",

    "we write this result as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath40 is the bcs free energy for layer @xmath25 . if , on the other hand , we keep @xmath41 but set @xmath42 we obtain the results for the balanced fermi gas in an optical potential , derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we keep @xmath41 and investigate @xmath43 .",
    "we now treat the additional tunneling terms as a perturbation , and expand up to order @xmath44 .",
    "diagrammatically , the process we include in the self - energy of layer @xmath25 consists of a particle tunneling back and forth over layer @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",

    "we will investigate the specific case where both the 2d density @xmath59 and the imbalance do not change significantly over the layers . in that case @xmath60 ,",
    "expression ( [ tunnelresult ] ) , is also not changing significantly from layer to layer , and we can drop the index @xmath25 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the superfluid motion over the layers",
    "is then due to the phase differences over the layers . using the results from @xcite , we can re - express @xmath60 as a function of the imbalance @xmath63 , and of the binding energy per particle @xmath64 , in units of the fermi energy @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "three regimes can be identified .",
    "the first regime occurs for large imbalance , @xmath67",
    ". then no superfluidity occurs ",
    "the fermi mixture is too imbalanced to support pairing .",
    "the second regime is the weak pairing regime , characterised by @xmath68 . in the three - dimensional case",

    "@xcite ) , we find that that the imbalance also reduces the critical velocity for flow through the lattice . in fig . 1",
    ", we show this reduction @xmath75 as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that for @xmath77 superfluidity is not present .",
    "the two regimes of weak pairing and strong pairing can be distinguished by a kink in the contour lines .",
    "the theory of flow through the lattice set up ref .",
    "@xcite is largely unmodified by the presence of imbalance .",
    "the main effect is the reduction of the tunneling coefficient @xmath78 expression ( [ tunnelresult ] ) . in this work",
    ", we kept @xmath79 constant and assume that @xmath80 vary slowly from one lattice site to another . under these assumptions , we have derived closed analytical formulae for the tunneling contributions ( and thus the critical velocity ) for flow of an imbalanced superfluid through an optical lattice .",
    "the assumption that @xmath80 vary slowly is good unless we have interleaving of normal gas and superfluid gas layers .",
    "if this is the case tunneling is suppressed because we take the optical potential to be deep enough such that the normal gas is pinned and flow is only due to phase coherence of the pair condensate .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath79 is related ; it also relies on the fact that there is no phase separation .",
    "this will be much more difficult to satisfy in practice , as coexistence may only be achievable at finite temperatures . in practice , at low temperature , there will be phase separation in the layer and the tunneling will only take place in the region of superfluid phase , and will be suppressed in the normal layer around it .",
    "this dynamical interplay between pinned normal state , and a phase separated superfluid are outside the scope of this paper , which relies on the possibility to create ( albeit dynamically ) an imbalanced superfluid .",
