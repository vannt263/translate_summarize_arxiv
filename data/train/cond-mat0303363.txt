    "a key insight of the landau fermi liquid theory is that interactions in a fermi system lead to the renormalization of the single particle fermion mass giving rise to `` quasiparticles '' with renormalized effective mass whose low energy behavior is qualitatively similar to the corresponding noninteracting free particles  @xcite .",
    "then , various single particles properties , e.g. specific heat , density of states , etc . , in the interacting fermi system are simply given , at least in the leading - order theory , by replacing the bare ( i.e. `` free particle '' ) mass @xmath0 by the corresponding renormalized effective mass @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we present the very _ first _ microscopic calculation of the _ temperature dependent _ effective mass renormalization in an interacting 2d electron system ( 2des ) , finding in the process an unexpected nonanalytic and nonmonotonic behavior of the effective mass @xmath2 as a function of temperature in the 2des .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 first increases linearly with temperature in a 2des reaching a density dependent maximum around @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the noninteracting fermi temperature , after which it decreases with increasing temperature .",
    "this nonmonotonic behavior , in particular the temperature induced enhancement of the 2des quasiparticle effective mass at low temperatures , is entirely unexpected because the naive expectation is that quantum many - body electron - electron interaction effects ( underlying the effective mass renormalization phenomenon ) should decrease with increasing temperature since the high temperature system is necessarily a classical system .",
    "the nonanalytic linear-@xmath5 dependence of @xmath2 is also quite unexpected since the usual fermionic sommerfeld thermal expansion always results in a quadratic temperature correction .",
    "our work is partially motivated by the great deal of recent activity in semiconductor - based 2des , e.g. si inversion layers , gaas heterostructures and quantum wells , etc . where the 2d carrier density can be varied ( by tuning an external gate voltage ) , modifying the strength of the electron - electron interaction usually measured  @xcite by the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the 2d carrier density and @xmath0 the bare ( i.e. band ) mass .",
    "the @xmath8-parameter  @xcite in 3d metals ( defined with respect to 3d densities ) is typically @xmath9 whereas in semiconductor 2des @xmath8 could vary from @xmath10 ( or less ) to @xmath11 ( or higher ) , depending on the specific semiconductor system and carrier density being studied . since the effective mass renormalization scales with @xmath8 ( small and large @xmath8 respectively corresponding to weakly and strongly interacting electron systems ) , one expects interesting and important many - body quasiparticle renormalization in 2des , particularly at large @xmath8 .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the issue of the effective mass renormalization in 2des has been extensively studied , both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite over the last thirty years .",
    "all these theoretical studies of quasiparticle mass renormalization have , however , been restricted to @xmath12 both in the 2d  @xcite and 3d  @xcite system .",
    "while this zero - temperature restriction makes perfect sense in 3d systems where the relevant fermi temperature @xmath13 ( defining the temperature scale for the electron system ) is extremely high ( @xmath14 in metals ) , it makes little sense for extremely low density 2des of current interest  @xcite where @xmath15 , making @xmath16 in the experimental temperature range .",
    "the temperature ( and density ) dependent effective mass renormalization calculation presented in this paper therefore takes on additional significance because a number of recent experiments have reported large 2d effective mass renormalization  @xcite at low densities and low temperatures .",
    "we note in this context that the 2d effective mass renormalization @xmath17 in our finite temperature many - body theory is a function of two dimensionless parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , since @xmath21 in 2des ) , which are however _ not _ completely independent of each other ( since they both depend on the electron density)in particular , @xmath22 for a fixed temperature and changing density .",
    "the structure of this paper goes as following : in section  [ sec : theory ] we present the theory for our effective mass calculation . in section  [ sec : num ] we provide our numerical results of our calculated effective mass as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath5 . in section  [ sec : ana ] we present the analytical results for effective mass in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 limit .",

    "it is well established that at zero temperature one can do an @xmath8 expansion for the quasiparticle self - energy in the @xmath23 limit since the leading order contribution in @xmath8 comes only from the ring diagrams , which are exactly what we calculated in our theory ( fig .",

    "we mention here that this nonmonotonic zero temperature @xmath8 dependence of the effective mass has already been found by previous works  @xcite .    the second term in eq .",

    "[ fig : mtrlrs ] and discussed in section  [ sec : num ] .    the subleading temperature correction , shown as the third term in eq .",

    "this result transcends our specific gw approximation scheme since it persists for @xmath23 where our approximation is exact .",
    "since all quantum many - body renormalization must vanish in the classical high temperature limit , it follows rigorously that @xmath2 must be nonmonotonic with a peak somewhere at an intermediate temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mtr ] .",
    "we point out , however , that this nonmonotonicity would not be easy to observe experimentally since the quasiparticle is unlikely to be well - defined at finite values of @xmath19 ( @xmath105 ) where the peak of @xmath2 lies .",
    "on the other hand , it should be possible to experimentally verify our predicted non - analytic linear in @xmath5 enhancement of the quasiparticle effective mass at low @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we comment on the approximations used in our calculation .",
    "first , our theory leaves out quasi-2d form factor ( and related solid state physics ) effects which are straightforward to include  @xcite by appropriately modifying the bare interaction @xmath106 in the theory , and would not lead to any qualitative changes in the results ( but would reduce the magnitude of the mass renormalization by a factor of @xmath107 to @xmath108 depending on the electron density ) .",
    "second ( and more importantly ) , our use of the leading - order gw - rpa approximation , which is exact only in the high density ( @xmath99 ) limit , is open to question .",
    "although we believe that at finite temperatures the gw - rpa approximation becomes more accurate ( and our quasiparticle energy calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) approximately incorporates some vertex corrections going beyond the leading order expansion in the dynamically screened interaction  @xcite ) , our principal rationale for carrying out the gw - rpa many - body calculation is that ( a ) it is the _ only systematic _ many - body perturbative calculation that is feasible for interacting quantum coulomb systems ; and ( b ) rpa , while being exact only in the weakly interacting @xmath23 limit , is known to produce qualitatively reasonable results even in the strongly interacting ( @xmath48 ) regime , as demonstrated by the agreement between rpa and experiments in 3d metals ( @xmath109 ) and in 2d semiconductor systems ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the fact that our predicted nonanalytic low temperature many - body enhancement of effective mass systematically persists to the @xmath23 regime shows the generic validity of our results . in additiion ,",
    "rpa self - energy calculation should become more accurate as @xmath8 increases ( i.e. decreasing density ) for a fixed non - zero @xmath5 because rpa is exact at any density for @xmath111 .",
    "in this context we emphasize that the rpa self - energy calculation ( i.e. our effective mass calculation based on the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : fynman ] ) is an expansion in the dynamically screened coulomb interaction which becomes equivalent to an expansion in @xmath8 only in the @xmath88 limit .",
    "the rpa self - energy at arbitrary @xmath8 may _ not _ be an expansion in @xmath8 at all , but in some other effective parameters .",
    "even in the high - density @xmath88 limit , the effective expansion parameter turn out to be @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a number of order 15(5 ) in 3(2 ) dimensional systems ."
