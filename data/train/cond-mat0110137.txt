    "dyakonov and shur@xmath1have described a new mechanism of plasma wave generation in an ultrashort - channel ( ballistic ) field effect transistor .",
    "it was shown that 2d - electrons in a bfet can be described by equations analogous to the hydrodynamic equations for shallow water , the plasma waves being similar to shallow water waves .",
    "therefore , various hydrodynamic phenomena observed in shallow water may occur in the 2d - electron fluid . in ref.@xmath2",
    ", it was demonstrated that the non - symmetric boundary conditions with fixed source potential and drain current lead to instability of the stationary state with dc current .",
    "the fet channel is a resonator cavity , with plasma wave generation mechanism similar to that known for self - excitation of jets and organ pipes .",
    "both the eigenfrequencies and the instability increment were found for dissipationless electrons .",
    "the plasma wave generation in short channel fets is very important for using these devices as high - power sources in the terahertz frequency range .",
    "the experimental results@xmath3 found for the response of gaas hemt in the detector mode agrees with theoretical predictions.@xmath4 then , the recent experiments@xmath5 concerning ghz plasma waves in 2deg make an observation of  shallow water instability  to be more feasible .    in ref.@xmath6 , nonlinear evolution of the instability",
    "was considered with account of both the electron fluid viscosity related to electron - electron scattering and the friction due to electron scattering by phonons and(or ) impurities .",
    "the instability has a threshold found for the case of small viscosity and friction.@xmath7 as expected , the instability leads , instead of chaotic motion , to the establishment of low - amplitude stationary oscillations , provided that the threshold current is exceeded by a small enough margin . in accordance with the theory of weak turbulence in conventional hydrodynamics@xmath8 ,",
    "the amplitude is proportional to the square root of the current near the instability threshold .",
    "as predicted in ref.@xmath6 , at high enough increments the instability may result in the formation of step - like electron concentrations and velocity distributions@xmath9 similar to shock waves in the conventional hydrodynamics .",
    "in ref.@xcite the shock wave formation for non - viscous flow in the fet channel for the case of symmetric boundary conditions was investigated both analytically and numerically .    in ref.@xmath10 ,",
    "the instability increment and threshold were calculated in the special case of strong friction and zero viscosity .",
    "the electron scattering results in the narrowing of an instability region , with the instability increment decreasing .",
    "the instability vanishes at a certain critical value of friction .",
    "the analytical results are in excellent agreement with computer simulations .    neglecting the friction of the electron fluid , we study the strongly nonlinear instability mode both analytically and using computer simulations .",
    "first , we check the reliability of our numerical method in the analytically solvable case of a linear instability mode .",
    "then , we demonstrate that the instability leads to high - amplitude stationary oscillations caused by shock wave formation in the fet channel . the shape and speed of the numerically found shock waves",
    "are well described in terms of the conventional hydrodynamics . finally , the amplitude of stationary oscillations is determined .",
    "in ref.@xcite , it was shown that 2d electrons in a bfet can be described by the equations analogous to the hydrodynamic equations for shallow water :    @xmath11    here , the voltage swing , @xmath12 , corresponds to shallow water level , @xmath13 is the local gate - to - channel voltage , and @xmath14 is the threshold voltage .",
    "then , @xmath15 is the local electron flux velocity , @xmath16 is the electron effective mass , @xmath17 *  * is the viscosity related to electron - electron scattering .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) is similar to the continuity equation in hydrodynamics , taking into account the gradual channel approximation relationship@xmath18    @xmath19    here , @xmath20 is the surface electron concentration , @xmath21 is the capacitance per unit area .",
    "then , eq.([navier - stocks ] ) is analogous to the euler s equation in which we neglect the pressure gradient term.@xmath22 note , eqs.([continuity]-[shockley ] ) represent , in fact , the simplified set of equations . in general",
    ", one have to solve the exact poisson s and navier - stocks hydrodynamic equations .",
    "actually , within gradual channel approximation the higher order terms in the plasmon dispertion law@xmath23 as well as the edge - effects contribition to the electric field are neglected .    in ref.@xcite , it was demonstrated that the steady electron flow is unstable under the following boundary conditions :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the fixed source potential(@xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 is the current per unit gate width , fixed at the drain ( @xmath28 ) . in the steady state ,",
    "@xmath29 are constants : @xmath30 neglecting the viscosity , we can easily solve eqs.([continuity]-[boundary conditions ] ) linearized with respect to small perturbations of the steady state flow ( see appendix ) .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the instability results in plasma wave generation , with the fet channel playing the role of a resonator cavity .",
    "both the eigenfrequencies and the instability increment ( see eq.[frequency ] ) depend on @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the analog of the mach number in hydrodynamics and , @xmath33 is the plasma wave velocity .",
    "the instability exists at @xmath34 .",
    "we now investigate the strongly nonlinear instability mode , when shock waves are formed in the fet channel . as well known in the conventional hydrodynamics ,",
    "the mass and momentum conservation laws determine the shape and variables on both sides of the shock wave .",
    "with dimensionless coordinate @xmath35 , time @xmath36 , and variables @xmath37 introduced , eqs.([continuity],[navier - stocks ] ) yield    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the dimensionless viscosity .",
    "we can easily find a self - consistent solution of eqs.([mass conservation],[momentum ] ) which corresponds to a shock wave propagating in an infinite medium at fixed velocity , @xmath40 , of the wave front .",
    "simple integration of eqs.([mass conservation],[momentum ] ) over the interval containing the shock wave discontinuity yields *  * @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the current and momentum fluxes which are continuous in the shock wave . with eq.([sw equations ] ) , the shape of the shock wave can be easily derived as follows:@xmath43    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , @xmath46  is the relative velocity of the electron flow with respect to the shock wave front , @xmath47 .",
    "it is noteworthy that for a shock wave propagating in the infinite medium the dimensionless coordinate , @xmath48 , does not contain the sample length scale @xmath49 .",
    "then , according to eq.([sw shape ] ) the spatial distribution of the shock wave velocity and potential , @xmath50 , are universal functions of @xmath51 . for a low - amplitude shock wave , solving eq.([sw shape ] ) yields",
    "@xmath52 here , the indices @xmath53 and @xmath54 label , respectively , the values of the hydrodynamic variables in front of , and behind the shock wave ( see fig.[fig.4]a , b ) , in accordance to ref.@xmath55 .",
    "then , @xmath56 is the front width of the low - amplitude shock wave .",
    "the smaller the amplitude , the wider the front .",
    "we emphasize that eq.([sw equations ] ) provides that the energy conservation law is @xmath57 satisfied .",
    "the energy dissipated within the discontinuity is equal to the difference of energy flux densities @xmath58  on both sides of the shock wave .",
    "moreover , eq.([sw equations ] ) determines the direction in which the variables in the shock wave change as @xmath59 , then gives the jump conditions known in the conventional hydrodynamics.@xmath8  indeed , for a shock wave in the infinite medium @xmath60 , and , therefore the components @xmath61  and @xmath62are related by    @xmath63    where @xmath64  is the relative velocity of the electron flow in front of , and behind the shock wave , respectively .",
    "we now seek the velocities and the potential on both sides of the shock wave and the speed of the shock wave front , taking into account eq.([relationship ] ) and the dimensionless boundary conditions @xmath65 specified by eq.([boundary conditions ] ) . in this case , however , the number of algebraic equations is less than the total number of variables .",
    "consequently , we set the relative shock wave amplitude , @xmath66 @xmath67 , as a free variable . finally , the speed of the shock wave front , @xmath68 , and the electron flow velocity at the source , @xmath69 , are given by @xmath70 here , the signs correspond to shock wave propagating in the channel upstream ( + ) and downstream ( - ) , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath71 is the shock wave front speed for a stagnant electron fluid ( i.e. that with @xmath72 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the speed of the low - amplitude ( @xmath73 ) shock wave front coincides with the plasma wave propagation velocities @xmath74 , in agreement with the conventional hydrodynamics.@xmath75 it will be recalled that eqs.([source velocity],[sw speed ] ) are valid when @xmath76 .",
    "let us first estimate the order of magnitude of the dimensionless viscosity @xmath77 . in a highly non - ideal 2deg , with the thermal , bohr , and fermi energies of the same order of magnitude",
    ", the viscosity of the electron fluid is given@xmath1 by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the fermi velocity , @xmath80 is the mean free path for electron - electron collisions . for @xmath81v , @xmath82@xmath83 , and submicrometer ( @xmath84 @xmath85 m ) algaas / ingaas based fet at @xmath86k we obtain @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly , we further assume that @xmath88    we now compare our analytical results with computer simulation data .",
    "the numerical method used is the well - known broilovskaya algorithm@xmath89  adapted for a system with two boundaries . in ref.@xmath90 , a detailed description of the numerical procedure based on eqs.([mass conservation],[momentum ] ) was given . as was underlined in ref.@xcite",
    ", a finite - difference approximation methods always involve a numerical error which could be associated with a diffusion - like term similar to that in eq.([momentum ] ) .",
    "consequently , we further assume that within our numerical method there exists a nonzero parasitic  numerical viscosity",
    " @xmath91 .",
    "we will demonstrate that @xmath92 .    in the present paper we use two different numerical approaches .",
    "initially ( case ( i ) ) , we omit viscosity term ( @xmath93 ) in eqs.([mass conservation],[momentum ] ) , and then solve them under the boundary conditions specified by eq.([boundary conditions ] ) .",
    "we use the first mode of plasma wave oscillations ( eqs.([helix ] ) at @xmath94 ) as the initial condition . in fig.[fig.1 ] , the computer simulation data are presented as the time dependence of the velocity at the source , @xmath95 , in relation to the drain potential @xmath96 for different mach numbers . in the same figure",
    ", we plot the solution given by eq.([helix ] ) , found within the linear approximation .",
    "the computer simulation data are well described by the analytical theory in the linear regime of the instability evolution for @xmath34 .",
    "*  *    we now consider the strongly nonlinear instability regime . instead of a chaotic motion ,",
    "as expected , the instability leads to stationary oscillations irrespective of the initial conditions .",
    "the oscillation amplitude depends on the mach number . as an example , in fig.[fig.2 ] we plot four different phases clearly defined in stationary oscillations . in the first step ( fig.[fig.2],a )",
    ", the shock wave appears at the drain and moves therefrom toward the source .",
    "after subsequent reflection from the source the jump propagates upstream the channel and then disperses ( fig.[fig.2],b ) .",
    "the dispersion of the shock wave front is a generic phenomenon known in the conventional hydrodynamics.@xmath75 in other phases , there are relatively smooth distributions moving downstream and upstream the channel . *",
    "* it is noteworthy that the shallow rapid oscillations near the discontinuity ( see fig.[fig.2],a ) are numerical artifacts that always appear in finite - difference approximation methods for a non - viscous flow.@xmath97    let us now examine in more detail the shock wave clearly defined ( bold line ) in fig.[fig.2],a .",
    "it can be seen that a discontinuity approaching the source can be described analytically in terms of a shock wave in the infinite medium . to confirm this , we plot in fig.[fig.1 ] the analytical dependences",
    "@xmath98 given by eq.([source velocity ] ) .",
    "we ascertained that the upstream shock wave at the source is well described by the theory at @xmath99 .",
    "it should be noted that the above description fails to account for the dependence of the amplitude of stationary oscillations on the mach number .",
    "nevertheless , we use the computer simulation data and find the amplitude of stationary oscillations , @xmath100 , associated with the downstream shock wave ( fig.[fig.1 ] , point a ) . this dependence",
    "( see fig.[fig.3],a ) correlates with that furnished by eq.([frequency ] ) for the instability increment .",
    "the higher the increment , the stronger the amplitude of stationary oscillations . using the dependence",
    "@xmath101  and eq.([sw speed ] ) , we can readily calculate the speed of the upstream and downstream shock waves ( see fig.[fig.3 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that at @xmath102 the speed of the low - amplitude shock waves coincides with the plasma wave propagation velocities @xmath74 .",
    "up to now , we have used the approach @xmath93 , with the parasitic  numerical viscosity  assumed to be small @xmath92 .",
    "let us examine the opposite situation ( case(ii ) ) @xmath103  @xmath104  with viscous term included in eq.([momentum ] ) . if this case , eqs.([mass conservation],[momentum ] ) has higher order and ,",
    "consequently , requires an additional boundary condition other than those given by eq.([boundary conditions ] ) .",
    "fortunately , the extra condition can be readily found with the help of the continuity equation .",
    "indeed , for a fixed voltage at the source eq.([mass conservation ] ) yields @xmath105 .",
    "previously , this condition was derived in ref.@xmath6  on the basis of a more complicated reasoning .",
    "*  * with the above set of boundary conditions , we examined numerically the instability evolution of a viscous flow at @xmath106 and @xmath107 . as expected , in the linear regime of instability ,",
    "the numerical data coincide with those found above for the non - viscous case ( i ) .",
    "then , in the nonlinear regime , the viscosity enhancement results in a minor damping of stationary oscillations .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations remains nearly constant in the actual range of @xmath77 , and , hence , we can use the simple non - viscous approach ( i ) instead of ( ii ) in this case .    to conclude",
    ", we estimate the parasitic  numerical viscosity .  in fig.[fig.4 ] , we plot the spatial distributions for upstream shock waves(see fig.[fig.1],a , point a ) at fixed mach number @xmath108  and different viscosities .",
    "it will be recalled that , for a shock wave in the infinite medium , the spatial distribution @xmath109  scales with @xmath110 .",
    "consequently , we can represent the same data re - plotted , e.g. the case @xmath111 .",
    "the plots are collapsed(see fig.[fig.4],b ) .",
    "in addition , we plot in the same figure the distribution of the potential in the shock wave , found from eq.[sw shape ] .",
    "it can be seen that the shape of the numerically found shock wave is well described by the theory . using the collapse formalism we can easily estimate the parasitic  numerical viscosity  to be @xmath112 .",
    "this value is consistent with estimations done in ref.@xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the exact value of the  numerical viscosity  within",
    "the broilovskaya algorithm is unknown .    in summary , in the nonlinear regime the current instability leads to high - amplitude stationary oscillations caused by shock waves formation in the fet channel .",
    "the amplitude of stationary oscillations is determined using computer simulation data . the numerically found shape and speed of the shock waves",
    "are well described in terms of the conventional hydrodynamics . the parasitic  numerical viscosity  is estimated .",
