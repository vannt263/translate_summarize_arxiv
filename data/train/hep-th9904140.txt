    "it has been known for some time that the renormalization of light - front field theories is an extremely challenging task , although systematic procedures have been developed over the years to handle these problems consistently @xcite , including boost - invariant regularization schemes @xcite .",
    "relatively recently , it was observed that a different boost - invariant regularization scheme may be employed in a treatment of light - front matrix field theories with @xmath1 interactions @xcite , following earlier work on the small-@xmath2 behavior of light - cone wave functions @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we follow the approach suggested in @xcite to determine the effective two - loop mass renormalization of the @xmath0 light - front hamiltonian . in section [ themodel ] , we begin by presenting the light - front formulation of scalar @xmath0 field theory in @xmath3 dimensions , and its subsequent quantization via commutation relations . in section [ boundstate ] ,",
    "we employ a manifestly boost - invariant procedure to extract the effective two - loop mass renormalization of the light - front hamiltonian .",
    "this result will be compared to a feynman diagram calculation that can be performed straightforwardly in two dimensions .",
    "a brief discussion of our results will appear in section [ the - end ] .",
    "consider the @xmath4-dimensional field theory described by the action @xmath5 , \\label{phi4model}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a scalar field defined on the @xmath4-dimensional minkowski space @xmath7",
    ".    working in the light - cone coordinate frame @xmath8 one may derive from the light - cone energy - momentum tensor expressions for the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath9 and conserved total momenta @xmath10 : @xmath11 , \\hspace{1 mm } \\mbox{``light - cone hamiltonian '' }    \\label{pminus } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we adopt the notation @xmath12 .",
    "light - cone quantization of the @xmath0 theory is performed in the usual way  namely , we impose commutation relations at some fixed light - cone time ( @xmath13 , say ) : @xmath14 = \\frac{{\\rm i}}{2 } \\delta ( x^- - y^- )   \\delta ( { \\bf x}^{\\perp } -   { \\bf y}^{\\perp } ) .",

    "together with the quantization condition ( [ commphi3 ] ) , imply the relation @xmath17 =    \\delta ( k^+ - { \\tilde k}^+ )   \\delta ( { \\bf k}^{\\perp } -   { \\tilde { \\bf k}}^{\\perp } ) .\\ ] ] it is now a matter of substituting the fourier representation ( [ phi ] ) for the quantized matrix field @xmath18 into definitions ( [ pminus ] ) , ( [ ptrans ] ) and ( [ pplus ] ) , to obtain the following quantized expressions for the light - cone hamiltonian and conserved total momenta : @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "we are now interested in calculating the effective two - loop contribution to the mass term in the light - cone hamiltonian , which is represented diagrammatically in fig [ twoloop ] .",
    "one advantage of working in light - cone coordinates is the absence of tadpole diagrams .",
    "i.e. the only two - loop contribution to the mass is given by the ` setting sun ' diagram below .",
    "a convenient strategy is to compute this diagram for vanishing ( external ) longitudinal momentum @xmath21 .",
    "the details of this method appear in an earlier article @xcite , so we will mention only the key ideas here .    first , note that the two - loop process can be obtained by two applications of the light - cone hamiltonian ; one application corresponds to the creation of three partons from a single parton via the interaction @xmath22 , while the subsequent interaction @xmath23 will absorb these same three partons to leave one parton left over . during the intermediate step , where there are three partons in flight , the sum of the light - cone momenta must be equal to the initial parton momentum , which we write as @xmath24 .",
    "we now consider what happens in fig [ twoloop ] .",
    "when the incoming longitudinal momentum @xmath25 is made vanishingly small by taking the limit @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to stress that in this limit , we never set @xmath25 identically to zero ; we simply investigate the limiting contribution of the diagram as @xmath25  which is always positive  is made arbitrarily small .    a detailed calculation paralleling the one carried out in @xcite  in which one studies the bound state integral equations governing the light - cone wave functions in the limit of vanishing @xmath25  may be used to calculate the limiting contribution of this diagram to the mass renormalization .",
    "the result is @xmath26 this quantity depends on @xmath27 only , since any dependence on @xmath25 was eliminated after taking the limit @xmath21 . in order to find the renormalized mass , we set @xmath28 .",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "firstly , note that a remnant of the longitudinal integration survives through the variables @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "these quantities represent the _ fractions _ of the external longitudinal momentum @xmath25 , and are thus integrated over the interval @xmath31 .",
    "they are not eliminated in the limit @xmath21 . to further illuminate the significance of these variables",
    ", we consider the special case of @xmath32 dimensions ( i.e. @xmath33 ) . in this case , the mass renormalization is @xmath34 now consider the feynman integral for the ` setting sun ' diagram of scalar @xmath0 theory in @xmath32 dimensions , with zero external momenta @xcite . in this case",
    ", the mass renormalization turns out to be @xmath35}. \\label{feynman}\\ ] ] if we use feynman parameters to rewrite this last integral @xcite , and perform the momentum integration , we end up with expression ( [ mass2d ] )",
    ". i.e. the integrals ( [ gamma ] ) and ( [ feynman ] ) are equal in @xmath32 dimensions",
    ". it would be interesting to test for equality in @xmath36 dimensions , and we leave this for future work .    interestingly , the parameters @xmath37 above  which correspond to fractions of longitudinal light - cone momentum in the light - cone approach  represent the familiar feynman parameters in the usual covariant feynman diagram approach . we have therefore discovered a physical basis for the feynman parameters .",
    "the actual value of the integral may be computed @xcite , and is given by @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is euler s psi function .",
    "the terms in the parenthesis has the numerical value @xmath40 .",
    "we leave an analysis of the self - energy contribution @xmath41 in @xmath42 dimensions for future work .",
    "we have calculated the two - loop mass renormalization for the effective light - cone hamiltonian of scalar @xmath0 field theory .",
    "an explicit evaluation of the corresponding integral in two dimensions was given , and shown to be precisely equal to the corresponding two - loop ` setting sun ' feynman diagram .",
    "moreover , we were able to attribute physical significance to the familiar feynman parameters ; namely , as fractions of vanishingly small external light - cone momenta .",
    "evidently , it would be interesting to study the integral ( [ gamma ] ) in more detail for higher space - time dimensions .",
    "in particular , ultraviolet divergences are expected in dimensions @xmath43 , and so we may invoke dimensional regularization to regulate the integration over transverse momentum space .",
    "this would facilitate a straightforward comparison with existing feynman diagram calculations in @xmath0 theory @xcite .",
