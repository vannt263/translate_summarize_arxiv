    "the first thermal characterizations of highly irradiated extrasolar planetary atmospheres were made by measuring the flux decrement that occurs during secondary eclipse , when an extrasolar planet passes behind its host star @xcite .",
    "this decrement gives an estimate of the ( hemisphere - averaged ) temperature of a planet s star - facing side at the time of eclipse and provides insight into the energy budgets of these hot worlds .",
    "secondary eclipse ( or , occultation ) observations have been widely interpreted as indicating two types of planetary atmospheres , namely planets with and without high - altitude temperature inversions @xcite . however , the number of free parameters in current models is such that in many cases it is still difficult to place strong constraints on a planet s atmospheric structure with the few data points available for most systems @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that sufficiently high levels of irradiation prevent strong optically absorbing species from condensing and `` raining out '' of the upper atmosphere of hot jupiters , thus directly linking high levels of incident stellar flux to the presence of a temperature inversion .",
    "however , subsequent secondary eclipse measurements with spitzer / irac have complicated the picture and a straightforward connection between irradiation and inversions now seems untenable . for example , tres-3b receives substantially more flux that does hd  209458b , yet the latter has an atmospheric inversion @xcite while the former does not @xcite .",
    "thus , planetary classification will require more subtlety than a simple critical - flux level model can provide .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested a correlation between stellar activity and the absence of a temperature inversion : in this hypothesis high - altitude absorbing species are photodissociated by the ultraviolet flux from an active star .",
    "it remains to be seen how this theory addresses the issue of temporally variable stellar activity @xcite .",
    "phase curves provide complementary insights into planetary atmospheres .",
    "if a system s total ( star plus planet ) infrared flux varies periodically and in phase with the planet s orbit , the variation can be attributed to spatially nonuniform radiation emitted by the planet .",
    "such measurements have the potential to constrain the planet s circulation and heat redistribution patterns .",
    "if incident stellar flux were instantaneously re - radiated by the planet , the hottest region on the planet would be at the substellar point ; such a phase curve is said to have zero phase offset .",
    "nonzero phase offsets thus imply heat transport around the planet ; for example , by advection of absorbed stellar energy by global winds @xcite , or by heating induced by atmospheric gravity waves @xcite . interpreting phase curves",
    "can be challenging because the brightest atmospheric region will also depend on the opacity structure of the atmosphere and the wavelength at which one observes the system .    the extrasolar planet @xmath0  andromedae  b  ( @xmath0  and  b ) is the first exoplanet for which a phase curve was reported .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ; hereafter h06 ) used spitzer / mips to measure the 24  system flux at five epochs over one orbit and reported a finite amplitude phase curve consistent with zero phase offset , though here we report a new analysis and interpretation of our h06 data based on a better understanding of mips systematics .",
    "the 8  observations of @xcite also found variations with zero phase offset for hd  179949b .",
    "observations of the less intensely irradiated planet hd  189733b  at 8  and 24@xcite revealed a relatively small temperature contrast between the planet s day and night sides and a @xmath6@xmath7  phase offset , indicating a moderate level of eastward heat redistribution from the warm dayside to the cool night side .",
    "it is important to note a possible observational bias : the first two phase curves were sparsely sampled and are for non - transiting systems with unknown orbital inclinations . though simulations suggest inclination should not substantially affect a planet s observed phase offset , the flux amplitude will be directly affected by inclination @xcite ; furthermore , phase curve interpretations are more ambiguous without the absolute calibration provided by a secondary eclipse @xcite .",
    "several groups have hypothesized a connection between temperature inversions and the magnitude of a system s phase offset ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the favored ( though unproven ) cause of inversions is a species residing at high altitude that absorbs optically but is transparent to infrared radiation . in this scenario",
    "an inverted atmosphere absorbs stellar energy at lower pressures where it should quickly reradiate to space ; in a non - inverted atmosphere the energy is absorbed much deeper , where it may circulate farther around the planet and cause a measurable phase offset .",
    "@xcite do a fair job of reproducing the hd  189733bphase curves , but they predict secondary eclipse depths for the more highly irradiated hd  209458b  that do not match the observations of @xcite ; @xcite also model hd  209458b  and they , too , do not match the observed eclipse depths especially well .",
    "thus , our current understanding of the atmospheric structure and dynamics of even the best - characterized planets still appears to be incomplete .",
    "this is the context in which we obtained the high - cadence 24phase curve of @xmath0  and  b  described below .",

    "* ) the mips detector response is spatially nonuniform and so we treat the observations as consisting of fourteen separate time series , modeling their systematics separately in the final fit . in each frame",

    "we shift and scale the model psf to determine the best - fitting combination of background , stellar flux , and psf position .",
    "using position - dependent model psfs does not significantly change our results , so in all our photometry we use a single model psf generated at the center of the mips field of view .",
    "we exclude hot pixels from the psf fit by setting to zero the weight of any frame s pixel that is more than 5@xmath17 discrepant from the median value of that pixel for all frames taken at that particular dither position , and also exclude bad pixels flagged by the mips reduction pipeline .    in each set of @xmath1140 frames ,",
    "the first frame has @xmath113% higher stellar flux , and the first several frames have a lower background , than the rest of the frames in the set .",
    "these effects may be related to the mips `` first - frame '' chip reset effect , though the effect we see is qualitatively different from the one described in the mips instrument handbook @xcite .",

    "we further exclude the first three contiguous aors ( 700 frames , @xmath18 minutes ) , which are markedly discrepant from the final time series .",
    "these first data were taken soon after a thermal anneal of the mips detector , and during these observations we see anomalous readings in the 24  detector anneal current , the scan mirror temperature , and the mips b side temperature sensor .",
    "the initial extracted photometry reveals a clear sinusoidal flux variation , but with additional variability correlated with the subpixel motion of the star on the detector , as shown in figures  [ fig : fluxcorrection ] and  [ fig : rawflux ] .",
    "this effect is likely from imperfect flat fielding rather than an intrapixel sensitivity variation as seen in the infrared array camera s 3.6 and 4.5  channels @xcite , because several time series with similar intrapixel locations exhibit anticorrelated flux variations .",
    "we tried creating a flat field by median - stacking all the bcd frames after masking the region containing the target star , but applying this flat field to the data before computing photometry did not reduce the amplitude of the position - correlated photometric variability .",
    "as we describe below , we suspect intermittent , low levels of scattered light interfere with our ability to construct a sufficiently accurate flat field    instead , we treat this variability by removing a linear function of position from the computed photometry at each of the fourteen dither positions .",
    "fitting functions with a higher - order dependence on position , or including cross terms , does not change our final results and increases the bayesian information criterion ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of free parameters and @xmath21 is the number of points ) .",

    ", we also apply our analysis to the observations of h06 . due to the limited temporal coverage of this dataset including the @xmath32 does not improve the fit ; therefore we use only 17 parameters when reanalyzing this earlier dataset .",

    "the background flux varies at the level of 0.1% , comparable in amplitude to the expected planetary signal .",
    "we also see these discontinuities in background flux during mips observations of hd  189733b  @xcite and hd  209458b(unpublished ; spitzer program i d 40280 ) .    because the measured background level varies with the spitzer aors it",
    "is extremely unlikely that this variability is of astrophysical origin .",
    "it is also unlikely that the background variability results from the calibration process because we see the same effect in both the raw and calibrated data products .",
    "we observe no correlation between the background variability and the various reported instrumental parameters , though we can not rule out either intermittent scatter from other sources or slight changes in the detector bias .",
    "a global sensitivity drift does not seem to be the culprit because the changes in background flux are uncorrelated with stellar photometry .",
    "although we were unable to determine the cause of the background variations , we suspect that they are due to small changes in the amount of scattered light reaching the mips detector .",
    "variable scattered light could also explain our inability to remove the motion - correlated photometric jitter with an empirical flat field .",
    "stellar photometry was substantially more stable on short timescales than was the background in all of the extended mips 24  observations we examined , so we use this photometry in our subsequent analysis .",
    "our observations include a flux calibrator star to check mips s long - term photometric stability .",
    "mips 24  photometry is known to be stable at the 0.4% level over several years @xcite ; if it were this variable on short timescales we would be unable to discern the expected planetary emission .",
    "we observed the k1  iii star hd  9712 , taken from a catalog of bright interferometric calibrator stars @xcite , during six aors . in our reduction of these data we do not apply a correction for pixel motions and we achieve a repeatability of @xmath36 .",
    "these observations , shown as the red triangles in figure  [ fig : phasecurve ] , imply that the mips 24  detector was stable over the course of our observations , and so we rule out detector sensitivity drifts as the source of the observed flux variations .    the level of mips photometric stability was not well known early in the spitzer mission , so h06 used the background , attributed to smoothly - varying zodiacal emission , as a calibrator to adjust the photometry ( see h06 figure 1b ) .",
    "as we now suspect the mips background variations to result from scattered light in the instrument , there is no longer any need , nor possibility , to use the zodiacal light as a calibrator .",
    "the h06 data were part of a preliminary spitzer program to assess variability of several systems for subsequent study in programs such as ours .",
    "its five @xmath0  and  aors were taken at separate epochs and there was no calibrator star , so it was impossible to make the assessment described above .",
    "we have reanalyzed the h06 data using our new procedure and find values consistent with those plotted in h06 figure 1a ( see our figure  [ fig : phasecurve ] ) and also with our new data .",
    "thus , h06 did still present the first orbital phase variation for an exoplanet .",

    "@xcite also show clear shifted hot regions at higher pressure ; the deep vortices produced by their simulations are several hundreds of degrees hotter than the surroundings .    setting aside the phase offset for a moment",
    ", the phase curve amplitude we measure could be directly interpreted in the context of the models of @xcite as a typical phase curve for a planet with orbital inclination of 50@xmath7 - 60@xmath7 .",
    "however , simulations with greater phase offsets tend to show lower phase curve amplitudes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; thus it is difficult to simultaneously explain both amplitude and offset and it is difficult to reconcile current theory with our observations .    alternatively , the large phase offset we see could represent reradiation of thermal energy deposited in shock fronts in the planet s atmosphere .",
    "many simulations predict supersonic equatorial jets on hot jupiters that carry substantial kinetic energy ; shocks could manifest themselves where the jet transitions to subsonic speeds .",
    "@xcite note that their simulations , as well as those of @xcite , exhibit structures which could be interpreted as shocks  however , these models do not explicitly treat shock physics . @xcite",
    "observe similar features in their models using an additional artificial viscosity factor to simulate shock behavior , and note that in high - altitude , high - velocity regions the energy carried by kinetic energy becomes comparable to the enthalpic energy .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that gravity waves in the atmosphere of a hot jupiter can also heat the planet s upper atmosphere .",
    "it is unclear whether either shocks or gravity waves can deposit sufficient energy in the 24photosphere to cause the large phase offset we see .",
    "we look forward to further research into these topics to determine whether these or other phenomena can explain our observations .",
    "we must also consider the possibility that the periodic flux modulation we see is intrinsic to the star rather than emanating from the planet .",
    "@xcite report evidence for intermittently periodic stellar activity in this system correlated with @xmath0  and  b s orbital period .",
    "they interpret this periodicity as a possible magnetospheric star - planet interaction , but they detect this periodicity at only some of their observational epochs .",
    "the consistency between our analysis of the 2006  and  2009 mips data suggests we are not seeing such a transient phenomenon , although analysis of additional activity measurements ( e.g. , from the keck observatory archive ) spanning the time of our spitzer observations would help solidify this claim . @xcite",
    "also report variations consistent with zero phase offset , which disagree with our observed phase offset .",
    "in addition , 24  stellar variability at the level we observe would imply much greater variability at optical wavelengths : this is not observed @xcite . finally , as discussed by h06 , energy considerations indicate that such an intense star - planet interaction would cause the planet to spiral into the star in @xmath85  yr .",
    "thus , the 24  flux variations are likely to be of planetary origin .",
    "although a general framework exists within which to interpret observations of exoplanetary atmospheres , our understanding is still extremely limited .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that some planets with claimed inversions can also be fit by non - inverted atmospheric models due to much greater number of free model parameters versus the limited number of observational constraints .",
    "in addition , there may be reason to question the reliability of some of the circulation models currently in use .",
    "@xcite , in their extensive exploration of initial condition parameter space , have recently shown the extreme susceptibility of at least one circulation model to minute variations in initial conditions , resulting in substantial variability in final `` steady - state '' temperature contrasts and phase offsets .",
    "this chaotic behavior calls into question the ability of at least some models to make accurate , qualitative predictions about any of the quantities we are interested in . other models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exclude planets polar regions from their simulations , where large vortices are often seen to form @xcite . while the polar regions present a small cross - sectional area in transiting systems , for non - transiting systems such as @xmath0  and  b  polar emission will constitute a larger component of the observed system flux .",
    "a fully consistent three - dimensional circulation geometry is essential for comparison to our observations .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to remember that general circulation models have trouble predicting global weather patterns even for relatively well - studied solar system planets ; thus , a comprehensive , quantitative understanding of extrasolar planetary atmospheric dynamics will likely remain elusive for some time to come .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we have described a new 24  phase curve , which we interpret as being due to emission from the planet @xmath0  andromedae  bmodulated by the planet s orbit . using a simple two - hemisphere model we determine the peak - to - trough phase curve amplitude to be @xmath86 .",
    "this result suggests an average `` hot side '' temperature of @xmath111800  k ; for an average - sized hot jupiter ( 1.3@xmath1 ) this implies a hemisphere - averaged planetary temperature contrast of @xmath11900  k and an orbital inclination @xmath87 .",
    "we find a phase offset of @xmath88 , where we break the uncertainty into the error relative to our ephemeris and the error in our ephemeris , respectively .",
    "such a large phase offset is difficult to reconcile with most current models .",
    "the phase curve is hotter hemisphere is offset to the east , as previously observed for hd  189733b  @xcite .",
    "we reanalyze our earlier ( h06 ) observations of this system and find a phase curve amplitude of @xmath69 and a phase offset of @xmath89 .",
    "there is no evidence for inter - epoch variability in the planetary phase curve .",
    "this is primarily due to the large uncertainties from the 2006 dataset and demonstrates the difficulty in measuring such variability with sparsely - sampled phase curves .",
    "there are substantial challenges in interpreting a phase curve observed at only a single wavelength due to the degeneracies between planetary radius , orbital inclination , and atmospheric composition and structure @xcite .",
    "some of these difficulties could be mitigated with phase curve measurements at additional wavelengths  ideally from space ( i.e. , warm spitzer ) but also potentially from ground - based near - infrared observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , commensurate phase curve amplitudes at both 3.6and 4.5  would suggest that @xmath0  and  b  does indeed lack a temperature inversion . on the other hand , differing phase curve amplitudes at these wavelengths",
    "could suggest an inversion and be more difficult to reconcile with the large phase offset at 24 .",
    "phase offsets in these or other scenarios would also depend on the particular atmospheric temperature structure of the planet .",
    "phase curves at 24  currently exist for only two planets , @xmath0  and  b  and hd  189733b  ( though unpublished data exist for hd  209458b ) .",
    "cool , inversionless hd  189733b  is probably the best - characterized extrasolar planet , and additional phase curves are already being observed for this object at 3.6  and 4.5 .",
    "phase curves of additional planets at multiple wavelengths are essential to ensure that our evolving views of the atmospheres of hot jupiters are not biased by unbalanced datasets .",
    "whatever the cause of the substantial energy transport implied by the large phase offset we measure , if this phenomenon occurs in other ( transiting ) systems there are important implications for transmission spectroscopy .",
    "line - of - sight effects cause optical transmission spectra to probe pressures comparable to those probed by mid - infrared emission ; temperatures near the planetary terminator of @xmath111800  k ( as we observe ) should easily be detectable with ground- or space - based spectra . @xcite and @xcite infer a terminator temperature on hd  209458b  of @xmath90  k at @xmath91  mbar ",
    "roughly at the expected 24  photosphere  which is not dissimilar from the hot terminator - centered hemisphere we observe on @xmath0  and  b. further phase curve and transmision spectra of additional systems are needed to determine whether this hot , high - altitude terminator measurement results from a mechanism similar to what we observe on @xmath0  and  b.    we note that @xmath0  and  b  is too bright to be observed photometrically at shorter wavelengths with the planned james webb space telescope ( though spectroscopy may be feasible ) .",
    "given jwst s magnitude limits and the expected high demand for its observing time , the community should consider a dedicated space - based mid - infrared photometry and spectroscopy mission @xcite .",
    "such a mission would allow uninterrupted long - term monitoring of nearby hot jupiter systems .",
    "this would provide high - precision measurements of these systems thermal emission and energy distributions , and possibly provide the first definitive evidence of dynamical meteorological processes  weather  on extrasolar planets .",
