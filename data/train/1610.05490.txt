    "in addition , he would also think that the states he receives are predetermined by @xmath15 during each round of the experiment , and not actually influenced by alice s measurement choice . thus all alice has to do",
    "is use her knowledge of the probability distribution @xmath16 and @xmath17 to construct her measurement results .",
    "what bob receives is the statistical average of the state of eq .",

    "@xcite , piani and watrous introduced a quantifier of steering  steering robustness , the minimum noise needed to destroy the steerability of the assemblage . here , we show that there also exists a temporal analog of steering robustness  temporal steering robustness ( tsr ) , that can serve as a quantifier of temporal steering .",

    "the radical - pair model has received considerable attention due to its ability to predict many of the behavioral features seen in experiments and its uniquely quantum features  @xcite .",
    "in addition , radical - pair reactions are known to occur within the biological photoreceptor cryptochrome  @xcite , perhaps leading to a biologically detectable signal . in the traditional  toy - model \" of this process",
