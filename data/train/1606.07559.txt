    "the study of the medium effect through the nuclear structure and reaction gives the understanding of the property of the neutron star .",
    "many nuclear structure and reaction models are based on the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) interaction to study the medium effect .",
    "it is useful to investigate the colliding two nuclei on the earth in order to obtain the information of the medium effect in the high density region exceeding the normal density .",
    "the elastic scattering has been investigated with the double - folding ( df ) model based on the frozen density approximation ( fda ) to understand the nuclear saturation property  @xcite .",
    "the df model has been successful to describe the nucleus - nucleus reactions from the microscopic view point  @xcite .",
    "the m3y interaction which has no density dependence is used in the df model at the first stage .",
    "the m3y folding model well reproduces a lot of reaction data in the most surface regions . the effective @xmath3 interaction is developed so as to include the medium effect expressed by the density dependence  @xcite .",
    "the density dependence is first introduced by the phenomenological way to reproduce the nucleus - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "after that , the density - dependence is improved by reproducing not only the nucleus - nucleus elastic scattering but also nuclear saturation property  @xcite . however , such density dependent and independent effective @xmath3 interactions , which are based on the m3y interaction , have only the real part .",
    "therefore , the imaginary part of the reaction potential should be constructed by the phenomenological way in the nuclear reaction analysis .    in order to solve the problem ,",
    "the complex @xmath0-matrix interaction is applied to the df model  @xcite .",
    "the complex nucleus - nucleus potential is obtained not only by folding the real part of the complex @xmath0-matrix interaction , but also by folding the imaginary part of the complex @xmath0-matrix interaction .",
    "therefore , the ambiguity of the imaginary part is reduced .",
    "in addition , the important role of the three - body - force ( tbf ) effect is made clear to reproduce the heavy - ion elastic scattering .",
    "the tbf effect , especially for the repulsive effect , is introduced to stiff the neutron - star eos .",
    "the repulsive effect is taken into account by changing the vector meson mass in refs .",
    "@xcite , and upgraded by introducing the multi - pomeron exchange potential ( mpp ) in refs .",
    "the mpp model includes triple and quartic pomeron exchanges , and can lead to the neutron - star eos stiff enough to reproduce a maximum star mass over @xmath6 .",
    "recently , such a conclusion has been obtained even in hyperon - mixed neutron - star matter @xcite . here",
    ", we note that the tbf contribution is investigated with not only our model , but also several models in the nuclear reaction and nuclear matter @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a new approach to investigate the property of the high - density nuclear matter in detail . in refs .",

    "especially , it is important to investigate the nuclear matter property over the normal density through the experimental data on earth .",
    "the present methods to investigate the medium effect over the normal density are first introduced in ref .",
    "but , the application is shown only for the @xmath1o + @xmath1o elastic scattering at @xmath8 mev system .",
    "therefore , we apply the present methods to several systems to confirm the reliability of the present methods to probe the medium effect over the normal density in this paper . in addition",

    "consequently , we confirm that the present methods are a powerful tool to probe the medium effect in the high - density region .",

    "@xcite , it is confirmed that fda is the best prescription in the case with complex @xmath0-matrix interaction to construct the proper nucleus - nucleus interaction that reproduces the observed scattering data .    here , we introduce two types of the present methods to investigate the medium effect over the normal density .",

    "there have been proposed three versions of the mpp model ( mpa / b / c )  @xcite , which reproduce the @xmath1o  +  @xmath1o angular distribution equally well but give rise to different stiffness of eos .",
    "we first use the mpa version giving the stiffest eos .",
    "the results with the other interactions will be shown later . with the replacement method",

    "we first investigate the medium effects in the high - density region above the saturation density , in the case of @xmath1o  +  @xmath1o scattering system in detail . because the @xmath1o nucleus is one of the ideal nucleus for the elastic scattering .",
    "the @xmath1o nucleus is the double magic number which means to have no strong channel coupling effect from the excited state on the elastic cross section .",

    "figure  [ fig:11 ] shows the result for the @xmath41c  +  @xmath41c system at @xmath2 300 and 400 mev . by the replacement method ,",
    "the tbf effect in the high - density region is clearly seen on the high - energy scatterings . at @xmath69 mev ,",
    "the effect of the shift of the k@xmath70 value is not smooth because the folded real potential around @xmath71 fm shows the transition from repulsion to attraction .",
    "the effect of the cutting method described by the bold ( blue ) curves is not shown on the elastic cross section . because the real part of the potential at 300 mev is too weak to affect on the elastic cross section as well as the imaginary strength is large enough even without the cutting method . at @xmath72 mev ,",
    "the folded real potential is sufficiently repulsive .",
    "then , the effect of the inner part of the real potential well appears in the elastic cross section . by the cutting method , the calculated elastic cross sections at 400 mev show the change as the reverse of the effect by the replacement method .",
    "this change is caused by the transition from repulsion to attraction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] . finally , the cutting and replace methods are the reliable tool to investigate the medium effect over the normal density even for the high - energy heavy - ion elastic scattering",
    ". however , we need the careful treatment because the transition from repulsion to attraction of the real part of the optical potential is shown in the high - energy elastic scattering .",
    "in summary , we have constructed the df potential with the complex @xmath0-matrix interaction including the tbf effect based on the mpp model . the medium effect in the high - density region",
    "have been investigated with two methods which are called as `` cutting method '' and `` replacement method '' . with both methods ,",
    "the @xmath1o  +  @xmath1o elastic scattering at @xmath2 70 mev is investigated . the medium effect including the tbf effect in the region over the normal density is clearly seen in the potential and the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "in addition , we made clear that the tbf effect up to @xmath4 1.6 @xmath5 has a critical role to determine the heavy - ion elastic angular distribution .    in order to confirm our result ,",
    "the interaction dependence is also investigated .",
    "the similar results are obtained with other complex @xmath0-matrix interactions , mpb / c and ceg07b . in this paper , we test not only the complex @xmath0-matrix interaction but also the phenomenological density - dependent interaction , cdm3y6 .",
    "the cdm3y6 interaction also gives the similar result , and it shows the important role of the medium effect in the high - density region .",
    "again , we made clear that the tbf effect up to @xmath4 1.6 @xmath5 has a critical role to determine the elastic angular distribution .",
    "in addition , the target mass and the incident energy dependences are investigated .",
    "the target mass dependence is investigated for the incident @xmath1o particle by the @xmath41c , @xmath42si , @xmath43ca , @xmath44zr , and @xmath45pb targets at @xmath2 93.9 mev .",
    "when the target mass number becomes larger and larger , the medium effect obtained by both of the @xmath0-matrix calculation and the tbf effect becomes invisible . because the imaginary and coulomb potentials also become large . on the other hand , the medium effect in the high - density region",
    "is clearly seen for the @xmath41c  +  @xmath41c elastic scattering at various incident energies .",
    "however , it becomes difficult to see the medium effect at @xmath73 mev on the elastic cross section . in this case ,",
    "not only the increase of the imaginary strength but also the decrease of the real strength is contributed .",
    "however , the cutting and replacement methods again becomes powerful tool to investigate the medium effect over the normal density when we increase the incident energy over 200 mev .",
    "our results imply that the medium effect including the tbf effect in the high - density region can be probed by the observed nucleus - nucleus elastic scattering .",
    "finally , we made clear the crucial role of the tbf effect in the high - density region on the nucleus - nucleus elastic scattering .",
