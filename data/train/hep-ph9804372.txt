    "the @xmath6 option of the future @xmath7 tev linear collider is a very interesting area for investigating new physics @xcite .",
    "processes like @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) could be studied indicating that lepton number ( flavour or total ) is not a global symmetry of the electroweak interactions . in this paper",
    "we would like to examine the @xmath10 process .",
    "this reaction violates the total lepton number by two units , @xmath11 .",
    "its potential importance and hopes connected with it are based on two facts .",
    "first , the sm background is very small and under control @xcite so with the planed luminosity 10 @xmath12 @xcite the cross section as small as 0.1 fb could give visible effect .",
    "second , its occurrence would indicate that there exist massive neutrinos of majorana type .",
    "these neutrinos must be heavy ( with masses @xmath13 ) as known neutrinos can not give any substantial signal @xcite .",
    "many papers have been devoted to this process during the last decade @xcite .",
    "for the first time this reaction was proposed and examined in 1982 by rizzo @xcite .",
    "additional interest has come with the paper @xcite where it was shown that the process is enhanced for heavy neutrino masses in the vicinity of the collider s c.m .",
    "energy . then the optimism was revised in @xcite where constraints on heavy neutrinos coming from neutrinoless double-@xmath14 decay have been taken into account .",
    "it has been shown that an observable signal requires fine - tuning among different heavy neutrino couplings . however , as it has been shown in @xcite , these cancelations can be in a natural manner connected with cp parities of heavy neutrinos .",
    "all other papers cited in @xcite give many interesting details connected with the process .",
    "this paper brings another such a detail which can however appear to be crucial for the magnitude of the cross section . in the last paper concerning the @xmath2 where all relevant constraints on the heavy neutrinos have been taken into account @xcite we have assumed that the neutrino mass submatrix @xmath0 generated by left - handed neutrinos    @xmath15    is exactly zero ( @xmath16 is the submatrix of dirac type masses",
    ", @xmath17 is the submatrix of right - handed majorana masses ) .",
    "this means that we have considered the class of models beyond the standard where only right - handed neutrinos were introduced .",
    "then , to get an observable magnitude of the cross section , at least 3 heavy neutrinos with appropriate cp signatures and masses were necessary . however , there are models where @xmath0 does not vanish .",
    "such nonzero @xmath0 changes the relations which restrict the space of parameters of possible ( i.e. allowed by experimental data ) heavy neutrinos couplings and masses .",
    "the full phenomenological discussion of non - zero @xmath0 has been given lately @xcite in the context of heavy neutrino production in @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) reactions .",
    "here we will restrict ourselves to two nonstandard models with possible nonzero @xmath0 . the standard model with both additional right handed neutrinos ( rhs ) and higgs triplets and the left - right symmetric model ( lr ) . details of these models",
    "can be found in literature ( e.g. in @xcite ) . as we are going to find the largest possible values of the cross section we consider models where cp is conserved in the lepton sector .",
    "the leading helicity amplitudes for the @xmath2 process can be written in the following , simplified , way @xmath22+\\left ( k_r \\right)_{ae}^2 m_a f_s^r \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    the matrices @xmath23 are part of the unitary matrix @xmath24 which diagonalizes the @xmath25 neutrino mass matrix m in eq.(1 ) , the index l(r ) is connected with the left ( right ) doubly charged higgs particle which is exchanged in the s channel .",
    "for details see e.g. @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the sum in eq.(2 ) runs over all light @xmath26 and heavy ( n ) neutrinos .",
    "let s note that the kinematical factors in t and u channels @xmath27 depend on @xmath28 , but the @xmath29 ones in s channel do not .",
    "first we will examine the t and u channels assuming only that the influence of the s channel is negligible ( heavy @xmath30 ) . at the end",
    "we will comment on the effect of non - zero @xmath0 on the s - channel contribution .",
    "the experimental bounds on the elements of the matrix , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , describing the mixing of electrons with light and heavy neutrinos can be summarized as follows    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    the first relation ( eq.(3 ) ) comes from low energy experiments @xcite , the other ones can be derived from the fact that neutrinoless double-@xmath14 decay @xmath36 has not been detected yet . for arguments on",
    "lower ( upper ) limits , see @xcite ( @xcite ) . ] .",
    "diagonalization of the matrix ( 1 ) together with ( 4 ) yields to the following relation ( @xmath37 )    @xmath38    however , @xmath39 is very small and can be neglected , then from ( 6 ) we get @xmath40    similar to the analysis given in @xcite let us discuss the influence of @xmath41 on the magnitude of the cross section for different cp parities of heavy neutrinos .    if we have only one heavy neutrino state ( or more but with the same cp parities )",
    "then from ( 3),(5 ) and ( 7 ) we get restrictions on @xmath41 @xcite    @xmath42    where m is the mass of the lightest of heavy neutrinos .",
    "it gives for instance @xmath43 gev for m=100 gev ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "for the above values of @xmath41 the mixing angle @xmath32 is limited to @xcite @xmath45    fig.1 shows the maximum value of the cross section @xmath46 where the parameters are restricted by relation ( 9 ) for three different values of @xmath3 and @xmath47 tev .",
    "we can see that for various @xmath3 there are different masses @xmath48 for which the cross section reaches maximum value , e.g. @xmath49 tev for @xmath50 . for @xmath51",
    "the maximum value of the cross section increases with increasing m ( @xmath52 in eq.(9 ) increases ) , for masses larger than @xmath48 the cross section decreases with m ( @xmath53const ) .",
    "we can see that only for @xmath54 and @xmath55 tev there is a small region of masses where @xmath56 fb .",
    "if there is only one heavy neutrino or more but with the same cp parities then the value of @xmath3 crucially determines @xmath57 .",
    "much effort is devoted to find the bound on @xmath3 parameters @xcite .    for the case of two heavy neutrinos with opposite cp parities we get the following inequalities ( @xmath58 )    @xmath59    when @xmath60 , to remove the bound given by @xmath3 ( eq.(11 ) ) , we have to assume that two neutrinos are almost degenerate : @xmath61 .",
    "but then we have practically one dirac neutrino ( two majorana neutrinos with opposite cp values ) and the cross section approaches zero .",
    "this was actually shown in @xcite where the @xmath60 case was examined",
    ".    however , for @xmath62 situation is different .",
    "the inequalities ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) can be satisfied only for the confined region of @xmath41 @xcite    @xmath63    positive values of @xmath41 are strongly restricted but the space of negative @xmath41 values is wider and depends on the values of m and a. in fig.2 we plot the results for @xmath64 gev and a=5 as a function of neutrino mass . as we can see lines start from different masses .",
    "this is because eq.(12 ) must holds .",
    "similar results can be obtained for larger spectrum of a @xmath65 . for positive @xmath41",
    "the situation is similar to the case with @xmath66 ( compare eqs.(8),(12 ) ) .",
    "results given in fig.2 describe also the case of three heavy neutrinos with the following cp signatures @xmath67 . then",
    "two heavy neutrinos @xmath68 contribute in the same way to the amplitude ( eq.(2 ) ) and can be effectively treated as one .",
    "the last quantitatively distinguishable possibility which is left for three heavy neutrinos is the case @xmath69",
    ". then initial inequalities ( 3,5 ) and ( 7 ) are satisfied if @xmath41 is confined to the following region ( @xmath70 ) @xcite    @xmath71    by fixing b=10 and m=100 gev for different values of a we have found mixing angles @xmath72 such that the cross section is maximal .",
    "the result is given in fig.3 for @xmath73 tev .",
    "for larger masses ( @xmath74 gev ) @xmath57 decreases , e.g. for m=200 gev , @xmath75",
    "fb . let us note that the largest results are possible for large a and then we can always find a space of allowed mixings for which @xmath76 fb independently of @xmath41 .",
    "similar plots can be made for other energies @xmath77 tev with a result @xmath78 fb and @xmath79 tev , respectively ( see @xcite for the @xmath60 case ) .",
    "finally , in fig.4 we describe the s - channel contribution to the @xmath1 process .",
    "we present the contribution of two doubly charged higgs particles @xmath80 and @xmath81 which exist for example in the lr model collider can be found in @xcite ] .",
    "masses of the @xmath30 particles depend on @xmath82 @xcite and for @xmath83=1 tev we have ( without fine tuning between parameters in the higgs potential ) @xmath84 gev and @xmath85 gev . as @xmath86",
    "the effect of @xmath81 is negligible . in such circumstances our considerations are also valid for the sm enlarged by additional higgs triplet and right handed neutrinos .",
    "let us note that the contribution of the @xmath80 resonance to the helicity amplitudes ( eq.(2 ) ) is directly proportional to @xmath41 ( @xmath87 , see e.g. @xcite ) and is invisible if only light neutrinos exist .",
    "if we take @xmath60 then the resonance disappears ( solid line in fig.4 ) .",
    "if however @xmath62 then its effect can be large .",
    "this is shown in fig.4 where we take doubly charged higgs widths to be @xmath88 .",
    "lines on this figure present the cross sections for the case when all heavy neutrinos have the same cp eigenvalues .",
    "as it has already been discussed , @xmath57 depends strongly on @xmath3 in this case .",
    "we take @xmath44 , so t and u channels contributions to the cross section are very small ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this means that the large cross sections in fig.4 , even for energies far away from resonance region , are due to the @xmath80 resonance .",
    "for example for @xmath89 gev and @xmath73 tev the @xmath90 fb and the effect is caused almost exclusively by @xmath91 higgs resonance . as the contribution of @xmath81 to the cross section is not proportional to @xmath41 its effect can be large even for @xmath60 especially if its mass is around the c.m . energy .",
    "this case has been considered in [ 16 ] .",
    "this is shown explicitly in fig.5 where s - channel contribution to the @xmath2 process as function of energy is presented . to extract the effect of the @xmath80 resonance we compare the cross section @xmath57 for t and u channels only ( short - dashed line ) with the total cross section where",
    "t , u and s channels are added altogether ( long - dashed lines ) for @xmath92 gev and @xmath93 .",
    "we can see the huge influence of @xmath80 resonance on the total cross section .",
    "even for very high mass of @xmath80 ( @xmath94 gev , @xmath73 tev ) @xmath57 is above the `` discovery limit '' .",
    "solid lines in fig.5 describe another case with @xmath95 .",
    "the upper one corresponds to the full cross section ( s , t , u channels ) , the lower one is for a cross section without the s channel . as we can see for @xmath96 gev , contributions of the s and t+u channels are now comparable .",
    "the influence of @xmath97 on the cross section depends on the @xmath97 mass and width , and the value of the @xmath98 parameter . for the same mass and the same width of @xmath97 its contribution to @xmath99 can be very small , comparable or much bigger than the t+u channels part depending on the value of @xmath41",
    "we have analyzed the predictions for maximum possible value of the @xmath2 cross section in models with nonzero @xmath41 .",
    "if we have only one heavy neutrino or more but with the same cp parities then the value of @xmath3 is crucial for the maximum of the cross section and @xmath41 does not have any visible influence . for the smallest value of @xmath3 ( @xmath100 ) predicted by some existing estimations ( e.g. @xcite ) the cross section @xmath57 is too small to be measured in the future @xmath6 linear colliders unless @xmath30 exist in the model .",
    "however , for all other cases , the @xmath62 changes substantially the @xmath2 cross section .",
    "negative @xmath41 values move the limits on experimentally allowed neutrino mixings and masses . if there are two heavy neutrinos with opposite cp parities ( or any number of them but with the lightest one having opposite cp parity with respect to all other ones ) the value of @xmath57 can be substantial , much above the background level ( e.g. for m=150 gev , a=5 , @xmath101 fb ) .    in another configuration of cp parities of heavy neutrinos ( @xmath69 )",
    "the largest @xmath102 is obtained for @xmath60 .",
    "the most dramatic influence of the non - zero @xmath41 on @xmath103 is connected with the @xmath80 resonance .",
    "for @xmath60 the contribution of this resonance to the process disappears .",
    "the @xmath62 values cause the @xmath80 to give large contribution even far away from on - peak energies . the contribution of the @xmath81 to the cross section does not depend on the @xmath41 value .",
