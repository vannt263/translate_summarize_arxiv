    "soc behavior has been observed in many cellular automata models of sandpiles @xcite , invasion percolation @xcite , biological evolution @xcite , depinning in random media @xcite , and also in some natural systems , such as earthquakes @xcite . even though the first cellular automaton displaying soc was conceived to represent the dynamics of a sandpile @xcite",

    "@xcite analyzed the transport properties of individual grains inside a stationary ricepile .",
    "they measured the _ transit time _ of individually colored grains of rice ( tracers ) , defined as the time necessary for a grain to escape from the pile .",
    "_ found that the distribution of transit times follows a truncated power law form , and that the average transport velocity of the grains diminishes as the system size increases .",
    "a cellular automaton model of a ricepile was proposed ( the so - called oslo model ) @xcite , reproducing the phenomenological behavior of the actual experiments .",
    "bogu and corral  @xcite have also suggested a theoretical scenario for the oslo ricepile , based on a continuous time random walk model .",
    "the main results of the oslo experiments and simulations can be expressed through a single function , the probability distribution of transit times @xmath3 , which is defined as the probability of a given tracer spending a time between @xmath4 and @xmath5 inside a pile of linear size @xmath0 .",

    "performing the same measurement for @xmath1 different grains , consecutively thrown in the pile , we can construct the sequence @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the time , measured in units of added grains ( the slow time scale  @xcite ) , spent inside the pile by the @xmath23-th grain , in the sequence of @xmath1 _ consecutive _ throws .",
    "the set @xmath20 can be interpreted as a discrete time sequence , assigning to the instant @xmath24 the value @xmath22 . in the fig .  1 we have represented such a sequence , for the transit times recorded in the cellular automaton model of ricepile described in ref .",

    "the method we have employed is that of _ multifractal analysis _ ( which , on the other hand , is not new in the field of soc @xcite ) . to this end , we have developed an algorithm particularly well suited to deal with one dimensional measures , like the ones under consideration . when computing the multifractal spectrum of the sequence @xmath20 , we observe that it shows considerable size effects : the spectrum of generalized dimensions @xmath26 ( to be defined later on ) depends on the system size @xmath0 and , even worse , on the sequence length @xmath1",

    "it is conceivable that the landing of a tracer may provoke an avalanche which would eventually evacuate out of the pile the very tracer that caused it .",

    "however , for @xmath78 we obtain stable spectra depending on _ both _ @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",

    "the previous formula suggests again the possibility of constructing a renormalized spectrum , universal for all values of @xmath28 , and independent of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this is done by plotting the finite - size relationship @xmath213 the validity of this scaling is checked up in fig .",
    "the plotted spectra correspond to the smaller values of @xmath0 and larger values of @xmath1 for which the relation ( [ new - scaling ] ) holds .",
    "the best collapse is obtained for effective exponents @xmath214 and @xmath215 , very close to the ones predicted in the limit @xmath27 . the rescaled spectra collapse onto a unique function , which is interpreted again as a renormalized spectrum , in the sense that it is a property of the intrinsic dynamics of the ricepile where the data came from , and independent of particular samples considered when computing it .",
    "this scaling behavior can be accounted for by the effect of the correlations inside the soc sequence .",
    "no dependence whatsoever on the system size ( the cut - off ) was observed in the synthetic power - law distributed signal in sec .",
    "[ synthetic - power - law ] .",
    "the only difference between that signal and the soc one resides in the _ correlations_. while the different points in the synthetic sequence are completely uncorrelated by construction , the soc transit times suffer obviously from long - range correlations .",
    "this fact is easy to realize when one considers that grains introduced into the pile at widely scattered initial times can emerge at the same instant in a single gigantic avalanche .    as a numerical experiment",
    ", we have estimated the correlation length in our soc sequences as the minimum length @xmath216 above which an @xmath217 analysis @xcite provides a hurst exponent close to @xmath218 .",
    "our estimates show that for @xmath219 the sequences become roughly uncorrelated for lengths larger that @xmath220 , whereas no serious estimate can be done for @xmath221 .",

    "( [ new - scaling ] ) , the @xmath217 analysis predicts a complete decorrelation and , hence , an independence on the system size .",
    "we interpret our results as a hint towards the existence of more deep intrinsic correlations that those revealed by a simple @xmath217 analysis .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the multifractal properties of sequences of transit times of individual grains inside an oslo ricepile . to this purpose , we have developed a fixed - mass multifractal algorithm , yielding the so - called _ dual spectrum _ , particularly well - suited to deal with highly inhomogeneous one dimensional measures ( in our case , time series ) .",
    "this is particularly for the transit time sequences , which are power - law distributed and are hence constituted at any length scale by a more or less average flat background , interspersed by relatively infrequent huge peaks .",
    "the main result of our analysis is the finite - size scaling relation  ( [ f - s - multiscaling ] ) .",
    "this scaling shows a particular behavior : the dual spectrum tends to decrease when increasing the sequence length @xmath1 , whereas it tends to increase with the systems size @xmath0 .",
    "while the first statement is in complete agreement with numerical experiments on synthetic uncorrelated power - law sequences , the second constitutes a completely unexpected result : as we show in sec .",
    "[ synthetic - power - law ] , the spectra of an uncorrelated random power law signal do not depend on the distribution s cut - off . since the cut - off is related to the system size of the ricepile , we should expect in the soc case to obtain results independent of @xmath0 .",
    "that is not the case , however , in our computations .    the renormalized spectrum defined in ( [ f - s - multiscaling ] )",
    "allows one to get rid of those finite - size effects , and constitutes a magnitude that can be associated to the very ricepile dynamics , not influenced by the hazards of the samples used in its estimation .",
    "we interpret the initial @xmath0 dependence as an effect of the extremely long correlations in the transit time sequence . as the authors point out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fact that the average speed of the tracers decreases with the system size proves that there are correlations all along the system .",
    "these correlations show up even more spectacularly when analyzing the multifractal properties of the sequences .",
    "a simple @xmath217 analysis seems to show an absence of correlations for @xmath219 and @xmath222 .",
    "hence , it could seem reasonable that , for these values of the parameters , the spectra should become independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this is not the case , however .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the transit time sequences indeed posess correlations of a range far larger than that possibly revealed by the @xmath217 analysis , correlations which are made evident only in our more sophisticated multifractal analysis .",
