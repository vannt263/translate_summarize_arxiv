    "the hexagonal manganites @xmath7mno@xmath0 ( @xmath7 = y , ho , er , tm , yb , and lu ) have been extensively studied because of their multiferroicity.@xcite in these materials , the ferroelectric order is formed at temperatures as high as 800 k , which results from the ionic displacements breaking the inversion symmetry of the lattice .",
    "the mn@xmath5 moments develop the antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering below @xmath8 = 7090 k. the magnetoelectric coupling has been found to be strong between the @xmath9-axis polarization and the @xmath10-plane staggered af magnetization at low temperatures , as the strong dielectric anomalies at the magnetic phase transitions have demonstrated.@xcite naturally , the magnetic structures and their transitions driven by changing temperature or magnetic field@xcite are the central issues of the magnetoelectric coupling in these compounds , which are still not fully understood due to the complexity of mn@xmath5 and @xmath11 magnetism .",
    "the mn@xmath5 ions form triangular planar sublattices and the af exchange coupling among mn@xmath5 moments is therefore geometrically frustrated . as a result , below @xmath8 ,",
    "the mn@xmath5 moments are ordered in a configuration that the neighboring moments are 120@xmath12 rotated , with the space group @xmath13.@xcite however , the homometric configurations of the mn@xmath5 moments in the triangular lattice are possible to change from each other when lowering temperature or applying magnetic field.@xcite the situation would be more complicated for those @xmath7mno@xmath0 with their rare - earth ions having magnetic moments .",
    "ermno@xmath0 , ybmno@xmath0 , and homno@xmath0 were found to have a second af transition at 2.54.6 k , below which the long - range af order of @xmath11 ions are formed.@xcite this low-@xmath1 af state can be easily destroyed by a weak magnetic field for ermno@xmath0 and ybmno@xmath0 , while it is much more stable in magnetic field for homno@xmath0.@xcite in contrast , tmmno@xmath0 does not display the long - range order of tm@xmath5 ions although they have pretty large moments.@xcite furthermore , the @xmath11 moments were believed to orientate along the @xmath9 axis with an ising - like anisotropy but their spin structures are not simple because the @xmath11 ions present in two different crystallographic sites , 2@xmath14 and 4@xmath15.@xcite because of the magnetic interaction between the rare - earth ions and the mn@xmath5 ions , the field - induced transitions of mn@xmath5 magnetic structure and the resulted @xmath16 phase diagrams are strongly dependent on the magnetisms of rare - earth ions.@xcite    heat transport has recently been proved to be very useful to probe the spin - phonon coupling and the magnetic transitions in multiferroic materials , including the hexagonal @xmath7mno@xmath0.@xcite in particular , homno@xmath0 was found to have extremely strong magnetic - field dependence of thermal conductivity ( @xmath2 ) , which is mainly caused by the magnetic scattering on phonons .",
    "an interesting finding was that both the @xmath10-plane and the @xmath9-axis magnetic field can induce strong minimum ( or  dips \" ) in @xmath3 isotherms , which are directly related to the transitions of magnetic structures.@xcite in this paper , we study the low-@xmath1 heat transport of tmmno@xmath0 , which is a special one in @xmath7mno@xmath0 family because the magnetic ions tm@xmath5 do not form a long - range order.@xcite it is expected that the magnetic correlation of tm@xmath5 ions might play an important role in the heat transport . to confirm this , the temperature and field dependencies of @xmath2 in tmmno@xmath0 are compared with those in two isostructural variants ymno@xmath0 and homno@xmath0 . besides rather strong magnetic - field dependencies of @xmath2 ,",
    "an important result is a sharp dip at 3.54 t in @xmath3 isotherms due to the transition of mn@xmath5 magnetic structure driven by the @xmath9-axis field .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field up to 14 t along the @xmath10 plane does not induce any magnetic transition .",
    "these heat transport behaviors have good correspondence with the magnetization data of tmmno@xmath0 .",
    "high - quality tmmno@xmath0 single crystals were grown by using a floating - zone technique in flowing mixture of ar and o@xmath17 with the ratio 4:1 .",

    "the magnetic susceptibilities and the inverse susceptibilities along the @xmath14 and the @xmath9 axes are essentially the same as those in some earlier literatures.@xcite the data show two main results .",
    "first , the temperature dependencies of the susceptibilities show some slight changes at @xmath22 84 k , which indicates the af transition of mn@xmath5 moments .",
    "these changes can be more easily detected from the temperature dependencies of the inverse susceptibilities .",
    "second , the tm@xmath5 moments do not show long - range order at temperatures down to 2 k. however , the low-@xmath1 susceptibilities show deviations from the paramagnetic behavior , which include a kink of @xmath24 and a weak increase of @xmath25 below 10 k ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) and the inset to fig .",
    "these suggest that the magnetic correlations among tm@xmath5 moments are not negligible .",
    "the low-@xmath1 magnetization curves of tmmno@xmath0 , which are not available from the literature , are useful for indicating the field - induced transitions of magnetic structure . as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , the magnetic field along the @xmath10 plane causes a simple paramagnetic effect . actually ,",
    "the @xmath23 curves are nearly linear up to 7 t except for a small curvature at low fields .",
    "although there was no report on whether there is transition of the magnetic structure for the field along the @xmath10 plane , the magnetization curves shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) strongly negate this possibility .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath23 in the @xmath9-axis field behaves very differently .",
    "first of all , the magnetization is much larger in the @xmath9-axis field , which is consistent with the @xmath26 data and indicates that the spin - easy axis of tm@xmath5 ions is along the @xmath9 direction.@xcite in addition , there is a clear transition at 3.54 t for temperatures from 2 to 10 k. it is coincided with a field - induced transition of mn@xmath5 magnetic structure from @xmath13 to @xmath27 , proposed from the earlier dielectric measurements.@xcite the feature of @xmath23 across this transition is the most similar to that in ermno@xmath0 among all hexagonal manganites.@xcite it needs to be pointed out that , however , there is by now no clear explanation for the sharp change of the @xmath23 slope at this transition , although it should be a direct response of the tm@xmath5 moments since the mn@xmath5 moments are known to have no component along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the earlier mssbauer spectra indicated that the tm@xmath5 ions on the 4@xmath15 site have af interactions and those on the 2@xmath14 site are simply paramagnetic.@xcite it is likely that the slope changes of magnetization curves for @xmath4 is a spin flip transition of the 4@xmath15 moments , considering their strong spin anisotropy .",
    "the slower increase of magnetization above this field is the paramagnetic contribution from the 2@xmath14 moments . in addition",
    ", the magnetization for @xmath6 is mainly the paramagnetic response of the 2@xmath14 moments .",
    "single crystals for magnetic fields along the @xmath14 and the @xmath9 axes , respectively .",
    "the hump at @xmath22 416 k is very robust under the in - plane field but gradually smeared out by the @xmath9-axis field .",
    "inset to panel ( a ) : the zero - field data and a fitting result , indicated by the solid line , by using formula ( [ c]).,width=245 ]    figure 2 shows the specific - heat data of tmmno@xmath0 single crystals at low temperatures and in magnetic fields along the @xmath14 and the @xmath9 axes , respectively .",
    "the zero - field data indicates no phase transition down to 0.4 k. however , there is a hump - like feature in temperature range from 4 to about 16 k , which makes the temperature dependence not to be described by the standard phonon behavior .",
    "apparently , this feature is caused by some magnetic contributions .",
    "the magnetic fields suppress the specific heat below @xmath22 16 k but enhance the specific heat above @xmath22 16 k , signifying a schottky anomaly from the paramagnetic ions .",
    "it is useful to try a fitting to the zero - field data by considering both the phononic formula and that of a simple schottky formula for a two - level system , that is , @xmath28 the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 describe the phononic specific heat using the low - frequency expansion of the debye function @xmath32.@xcite @xmath33 is the splitting of the ground - state doublet of magnetic ions and the concentration of free spins is @xmath34 , with @xmath7 the universal gas constant.@xcite the fitting can be pretty good , as shown in the inset to fig .",

    ". the fitting parameters for the phononic specific heat are comparable with those in other @xmath7mno@xmath0 compounds.@xcite the value of fitting parameter @xmath33 is also comparable to that from the analysis on mssbauer spectra.@xcite this indicates that the magnetic specific heat is mainly from a schottky anomaly of tm@xmath5 ions , which do not form a long - range ordered state at low temperatures .",
    "however , it is notable that the effect of magnetic field on the magnetic specific heat is much larger with @xmath4 than with @xmath6 , showing a phenomenon different from a pure schottky anomaly .",
    "actually , the field up to 6 t along the @xmath14 axis seems to produce very weak zeeman splitting of the ground - state doublet .",
    "this indicates that the short - range magnetic correlations of tm@xmath5 ions on the 4@xmath15 sites should be involved . in this regard , both the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility",

    "3 show that although the very - low-@xmath1 thermal conductivities of tmmno@xmath0 are comparable or even larger than those of ymno@xmath0 , the magnitudes of phonon peaks ( also locating at @xmath22 15 k ) are much smaller in tmmno@xmath0 . in addition , the @xmath45 curves of tmmno@xmath0 show some slight curvatures at 410 k , which indicates a resonant - scattering on phonons , probably by paramagnetic ions .     and",

    "it is clear that the field dependence of @xmath2 is not strong in ymno@xmath0 and is probably related to some scattering effect by the magnetic impurities or defects.@xcite in passing , this magnetic scattering is likely the reason that the very - low-@xmath1 @xmath2 of ymno@xmath0 show a weaker temperature dependence than @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , the field dependencies of @xmath2 are generally rather smooth and there is no any drastic change , which means that neither the @xmath9-axis nor the @xmath10-plane fields induce any transitions of the ground state and the magnetic structure .",
    "this is in good consistency with the earlier works.@xcite    the magnetic field is found to strongly affect the heat transport of tmmno@xmath0 . as shown in fig . 5",
    ", the effect of magnetic field on the low-@xmath1 thermal conductivities depends on the direction of field and are nearly the same for different directions of heat current . in magnetic field along the @xmath14 axis , both the @xmath47 and the @xmath21 show an increase at subkelvin temperatures and a decrease at higher temperatures .",
    "it is notable that the slight curvatures of the zero - field @xmath45 curves at 410 k are clearly enlarged in the 5 t and 14 t curves and a shoulder - like feature is visualized .",
    "this confirms the phonon resonant scattering behavior.@xcite when applying magnetic field along the @xmath9 axis , the heat transport changes in a different way .",
    "the low fields of 3.5 t and 4 t can suppress the thermal conductivities in the whole temperature range , while a high field of 14 t ( @xmath48 ) can significantly enhance the thermal conductivities , particularly at temperatures around 10 k. a common feature for the @xmath45 in either @xmath6 or @xmath4 is that 14 t field always increases the conductivity at subkelvin temperatures .",
    "single crystals for @xmath47 ( a - b ) and @xmath21 ( c - d ) in both the zero field and several different magnetic fields up to 14 t. the dashed lines in panels ( a ) and ( c ) indicate the temperature dependencies of the zero - field @xmath2 at subkelvin temperatures.,width=321 ]    from the @xmath49 dependencies of the zero - field conductivities at subkelvin temperatures , which are much weaker than the standard @xmath46 law of phonon conductivity at the boundary scattering limit , it is easy to know that the microscopic phonon scatterings are still effective at such low temperatures.@xcite since the crystal defects scattering on phonons usually fades away with decreasing temperature below 1 k,@xcite the phonons are mainly scattered by magnetic excitations or spin fluctuations.@xcite therefore , the high - field - induced increase of @xmath2 at low temperatures indicates that the magnetic scattering can be removed by high magnetic field.@xcite it can be known that the magnetic scattering is mainly related to the tm@xmath5 sublattice . on the one hand , although the mn@xmath5 moments are antiferromagnetically ordered at low temperatures , the strong spin anisotropy of mn@xmath5 ions and the resulted anisotropy gap in the magnon spectrum@xcite make the low - energy mn@xmath5 magnon excitations impossible at very low temperatures . on the other hand , the tm@xmath5 moments do not form a long - range ordered state but are antiferromagnetically correlated .",
    "it is also notable that the phonon peaks of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in 14 t field are comparable or even larger than those of ymno@xmath0 .",

    "the magnetic field is along either the @xmath14 or the @xmath9 axis.,width=321 ]    the detailed magnetic - field dependencies of the low-@xmath1 thermal conductivities of tmmno@xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "6 , which are apparently much stronger than those of ymno@xmath0 but weaker than those of homno@xmath0.@xcite first of all , as the @xmath45 data already indicated , the field - dependencies of @xmath2 are mainly dependent on the direction of magnetic field rather than that of heat current . and there are some important features of these @xmath3 isotherms that the @xmath45 data can not reveal .",
    "the most remarkable behavior is the sharp  dips \" in @xmath3 curves for @xmath4 and the positions of these minimums of @xmath2 are temperature independent from 0.36 to 7.5 k , which are very similar to the phenomenon observed in homno@xmath0.@xcite it has been known that tmmno@xmath0 has a field - induced spin re - orientation for @xmath4 .",
    "the transition field is decreased with lowering temperature from @xmath22 60 k and becomes weakly temperature dependent ( about 4.2 t ) below 10 k.@xcite therefore , it is clear that the dips in @xmath3 curves correspond to this field - induced transition of magnetic structure .",
    "one may note that the dip fields are a bit different in @xmath52 and @xmath53 curves , which are at 3.5 and 4 t , respectively .",
    "it is understandable if the demagnetization effect is taken into account .",
    "the samples for @xmath2 measurement are shaped into long - bar - like , with the longest dimensional along the heat current .",
    "therefore , for @xmath47 and @xmath21 samples , the @xmath9-axis fields are applied to the dimensions along the thickness and length , respectively , which yields rather different demagnetization factors for these two measurements .",
    "according to the sample sizes , the demagnetization factors are calculated to be 0.748 and 0.048 for @xmath47 and @xmath21 samples , respectively .",
    "using the susceptibility data from fig .",
    "1 , the difference in the ( external ) transition fields for these two samples can be calculated and is about 15%,@xcite which is in good consistent with the experimental observation .",
    "the @xmath3 behaves rather differently in the case of @xmath54 ; in particular , there is no similar sharp dip - like feature .",
    "it is consistent with the magnetization data of fig .",
    "1(c ) in the regard that there is no transition of magnetic structure for field along the @xmath10 plane .",
    "the overall field dependencies of @xmath2 , apart from the strong dips at 3.54 t , are also somewhat different for @xmath6 and @xmath4 . at the lowest temperature of 0.36 k ,",
    "the @xmath3 isotherms are very similar in different field directions ; that is , the @xmath2 show a quick increase at low fields and become nearly field independent above 2 t ( except for the strong dip for @xmath4 ) . with increasing temperature up to @xmath22 1 k , the @xmath3 isotherms in different field directions are still rather similar , including the appearance of a small dip at low fields .",
    "actually the features of a low - field dip and a high - field plateau in @xmath3 curves are qualitatively the same as that caused by the paramagnetic scattering on phonons.@xcite a significant difference between @xmath6 and @xmath4 appears at high temperatures .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath3 at 5 and 7.5 k show continuous suppressions for @xmath55 and strong high - field increases for @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "it seems that this difference has some correspondence with the field dependencies of specific heat shown in fig .",
    "2 . therefore",
    ", it is possible to understand this result using the paramagnetic scattering scenario,@xcite in which the magnetic scattering can be strong in the former case but would be removed in the latter case .    at last , it would be useful to compare the heat transport of tmmno@xmath0 with that of homno@xmath0 . in an earlier work",
    ", some dip - like anomalies have also been observed in the low-@xmath1 @xmath3 isotherms of homno@xmath0 at the field - induced transitions of magnetic structure.@xcite those results suggested that ho@xmath5 moments form two af sublattices and undergo two transitions upon increasing field along the @xmath9 axis , accompanied with two spin re - orientations of the mn@xmath5 sublattice .",
    "in addition , the @xmath3 data for @xmath56 revealed that a spin re - orientation of mn@xmath5 sublattice could also occur even when the ho@xmath5 sublattice may not be affected .",
    "in contrast , the magnetic transitions evidenced by the heat transport as well as the magnetization are simpler in tmmno@xmath0 .",
    "another difference between tmmno@xmath0 and homno@xmath0 is that the magnetic - field dependencies of @xmath2 are at least several times larger in homno@xmath0 .",
    "in fact , homno@xmath0 has very small zero - field @xmath2 and the significant increase of conductivity at high magnetic field.@xcite apparently , the mechanism for the magnetothermal conductivity can be shared for these two compounds , while the difference of @xmath3 is due to the stronger @xmath11-mn@xmath5 magnetic interactions in homno@xmath0 . in this",
    "regard , thermal conductivity results provide a transparent demonstration that the spin - phonon coupling in @xmath7mno@xmath0 is mainly determined by the magnetism of @xmath11 and is the strongest in homno@xmath0 .    although the mechanism of the field - induced re - orientation of mn@xmath5 moments is still not very clear , the magnetic interaction between rare - earth ions and mn@xmath5 ions is obviously very important . in hexagonal @xmath7mno@xmath0 ,",
    "the exchange coupling between @xmath11 and mn@xmath5 ions is weak because their moments are perpendicular to each other . in such case ,",
    "the dipolar interaction is more important and larger magnetic moment of ho@xmath5 results in stronger interaction.@xcite nevertheless , the magnetic interactions can be described by the effective fields acting on @xmath11 and mn@xmath5 moments . for magnetic field along the @xmath9 axis , there is no doubt that the transitions of @xmath11 sublattices cause the re - orientations of mn@xmath5 moments , because the mn@xmath5 moments are so strongly confined in the @xmath10 plane that they can not be in - plane rotated by the magnetic field .",
    "it is likely that when the @xmath11 moments are re - aligned in the magnetic field , the effective field from the mn@xmath5 lattice may cause an increase of the @xmath11 energy .",
    "the choice of a different configuration of the mn@xmath5 spin lattice would be an effective way to lower the magnetic energy and stabilize the magnetic structure .",
    "the case for magnetic field along the @xmath10 plane could be more complicated .",
    "the re - orientations of the mn@xmath5 moments would be irrelevant to the @xmath11 ions if they have extremely strong ising anisotropy .",
    "however , the different magnetic transitions between tmmno@xmath0 amd homno@xmath0 clearly indicate that the rare - earth ions are playing an important role also for @xmath57 .",
    "one possibility is that the @xmath11 moments can be canted or titled to the @xmath10 direction by the magnetic field , which results in a change of the effective field on the mn@xmath5 moments and the instability of their orientation .",
    "further quantitative theoretical investigations on the @xmath11-mn@xmath5 magnetic interactions are needed .",
    "the low - temperature heat transport of the hexagonal tmmno@xmath0 shows strong magnetic - field dependencies , which points to a rather strong spin - phonon coupling in this material . a sharp dip - like feature in @xmath3 isotherms for @xmath4",
    "is found to be due to the transition of magnetic structure , as the magnetization shows .",
