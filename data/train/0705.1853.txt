    "rank rigidity was first proved in the higher euclidean rank setting by ballman @xcite and , using different methods , by burns and spatzier @xcite .",
    "a manifold is said to have higher euclidean rank if a parallel , normal jacobi field can be found along every geodesic .",
    "ballman and burns - spatzier proved that if an irreducible , compact , nonpositively curved manifold has higher euclidean rank , then it is locally symmetric .",
    "ballman s proof works for finite volume as well and the most general version of this theorem is due to eberlein and heber , who prove it under only a dynamical condition on the isometry group of @xmath0 s universal cover @xcite .",
    "hamenstdt showed that a compact manifold with curvature bounded above by -1 is locally symmetric if along every geodesic there is a jacobi field making curvature -1 with the geodesic direction @xcite .",
    "she called this situation higher hyperbolic rank .",
    "shankar , spatzier and wilking extended rank rigidity into positive curvature by defining spherical rank .",
    "a manifold with curvature bounded above by 1 is said to have higher spherical rank if every geodesic has a conjugate point at @xmath5 , or equivalently , a parallel vector field making curvature 1 with the geodesic direction .",
    "they proved that a complete manifold with higher spherical rank is a compact , rank one locally symmetric space @xcite .",
    "these results settle many rank rigidity questions , but leave questions about other curvature settings open ( see @xcite for an excellent overview ) . in this paper",
    "we prove the following theorem , which can be applied to various settings in nonpositive curvature .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact , ( euclidean ) rank 1 , nonpositively curved manifold .",
    "suppose that along every geodesic in @xmath0 there exists a parallel vector field making sectional curvature @xmath1 with the geodesic direction . if @xmath0 is odd dimensional , or if @xmath0 is even dimensional and satisfies the sectional curvature pinching condition @xmath2 with @xmath3 then @xmath0 has constant negative curvature equal to @xmath1 .    in strict negative curvature ,",
    "the proof of this theorem is considerably simpler .",
    "in fact , for negative curvature the full frame flow is ergodic under the conditions of theorem 1 in all dimensions but 7 and 8 ( @xcite for odd dimensions , @xcite for even dimensions ) .",
    "then the proof of theorem 1 is immediate by considering a frame with dense orbit . for dimensions 7 and 8",
    "ergodicity of the @xmath6-frame flow holds under very strong curvature pinching ( see @xcite ) but under the curvature restrictions of theorem 1 one only has ergodicity of the 2-frame flow .",
    "note that ergodicity of this flow alone does not establish theorem 1 since the set of 2-frames giving the distinguished sectional curvature @xmath1 may , a priori , have zero measure .",
    "however , the ergodic theory of these types of flows , developed by brin , proceeds via explicit geometric descriptions of the ergodic components , and this allows theorem 1 to be obtained from the 2-frame flow dynamics alone .",
    "the proof proceeding via 2-frame flow gives the result in the exceptional dimensions 7 and 8 in negative curvature .",
    "in addition , it suggests an adaptation to the rank 1 nonpositive curvature setting , where the ergodic theory of frame flows has not been developed .",
    "the simplifications possible in the strictly negative curvature setting will be noted throughout the paper , but here we observe that although obtaining this paper s result for nonpositively curved rank 1 spaces necessitates a more technical proof , the resulting theorem forms a better complement to the rank rigidity theorem of ballmann and burns - spatzier .",
    "note that , unlike previous rank rigidity results , theorem 1 allows for situations where the distinguished curvature @xmath1 is not extremal .",
    "however , in the cases where @xmath1 is extremal the hypotheses of our theorem can be weakened , as demonstrated in section [ sec : parallel ] of this paper .",
    "the following two results are then easy corollaries of theorem 1 :    let @xmath0 be a compact , rank 1 manifold with sectional curvature @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that along every geodesic in @xmath0 there exists a jacobi field making sectional curvature @xmath8 with the geodesic direction . if @xmath0 is odd dimensional , or if @xmath0 is even dimensional and satisfies the sectional curvature pinching condition @xmath9 then @xmath0 is hyperbolic .    _",
    "( compare with hamenstdt @xcite ) _ let @xmath0 be a compact manifold with sectional curvature bounded above by @xmath8 .",
    "suppose that along every geodesic in @xmath0 there exists a jacobi field making sectional curvature @xmath8 with the geodesic direction .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd dimensional , or if @xmath0 is even dimensional and satisfies the sectional curvature pinching condition @xmath10 then @xmath0 is hyperbolic .    in corollary 1",
    "we obtain a new rank rigidity result analogous to those described above .",
    "this is the first positive result for lower rank , i.e. when the distinguished curvature value is the lower curvature bound ; @xcite provides a discussion of counterexamples to lower spherical and euclidean rank rigidity . in corollary 2",
    "we obtain a shorter proof of hamenstdt s result , under an added pinching constraint in even dimension .    in @xcite",
    ", connell showed that rank rigidity results can be obtained using only a dynamical assumption on the geodesic flow , namely an assumption on the lyapunov exponents at a full measure set of unit tangent vectors .",
    "his paper deals with the upper rank situations treated by ballman , burns - spatzier and hamenstdt .",
    "he proves that having the minimal lyapunov exponent allowed by the curvature restrictions attained at a full measure set of unit tangent vectors is sufficient to apply the results of ballman and burns - spatzier or hamenstdt . in the lower rank",
    "setting of this paper , this viewpoint translates into    let @xmath0 be a compact , rank 1 manifold with sectional curvature @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "endow @xmath13 with a fully supported ergodic measure ; one can take the measure of maximal entropy or , if the curvature is known to be negative , the liouville measure .",
    "suppose that for a full measure set of unit tangent vectors @xmath14 on @xmath0 the maximal lyapunov exponent at @xmath14 is @xmath15 , the maximum allowed by the curvature restriction . if @xmath0 is odd dimensional , or if @xmath0 is even dimensional and satisfies the sectional curvature pinching condition @xmath16 with @xmath17 then @xmath0 is of constant curvature @xmath1 .",
    "the adaptation of connell s arguments for this setting is discussed in section [ sec : lyap ] .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 relies on dynamical properties of the geodesic and frame flows on nonpositively curved manifolds .",
    "the work of brin and others is the starting point for the proof ; the results needed are summarized in section [ sec : background ] ( see also @xcite for a survey of the area ) .",
    "although none of his work is undertaken for rank 1 nonpositively curved manifolds , the ideas used in this paper to deal with that situation are clearly inspired by brin s work .",
    "the proof will proceed as follows .",
    "we utilize the transitivity group @xmath18 , defined for any vector @xmath14 in the unit tangent bundle of @xmath0 , which acts on @xmath19 . essentially",
    ", elements of @xmath18 correspond to parallel translations around ideal polygons in @xmath0 s universal cover . in negative curvature",
    ", brin shows that this group is the structure group for the ergodic components of the frame flow ( see e.g @xcite or @xcite ) . for the rank 1 nonpositive curvature case the definition of this group",
    "must be adjusted and we use only that it is the structure group for a subbundle of the frame bundle . the considerations for the rank 1 case are discussed in section [ sec : rank1 ] . in section [ sec : trans ] we show that @xmath18 preserves the parallel fields that make curvature @xmath1 with the geodesic defined by @xmath14 . finally , we apply results of brin - gromov ( adapted to the rank 1 case ) and brin - karcher on the 2-frame flow which imply that @xmath18 acts transitively on @xmath20 and conclude that the curvature of @xmath0 is constant .",
    "i would like to thank chris connell for discussions helpful with the arguments in section [ sec : parallel ] of this paper , jeffrey rauch for the proof of lemma [ rauchlemma ] , and ben schmidt for helpful comments on this paper .",
    "in particular , special thanks are due to my advisor , ralf spatzier , for suggesting this problem , for help with several pieces of the argument and for helpful comments on this paper .",
    "let us begin by fixing the following notation :    * @xmath0 : a compact , rank 1 riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature , @xmath21 its universal cover , @xmath22 the boundary at infinity .",
    "* @xmath13 and @xmath23 : the unit tangent bundles to @xmath0 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "* @xmath24 : the @xmath25-frame bundle of ordered , orthonormal @xmath25-frames on @xmath0 .",
    "* @xmath26 : the geodesic flow on @xmath13 or @xmath23 . * @xmath27 : the frame flow on @xmath24 ; when clear , @xmath25 will not be referenced . * @xmath28 and @xmath29 : the foliations of @xmath23 given by inward and outward pointing normal vectors to horospheres .",
    "* @xmath30 : the bowen - margulis measure of maximal entropy on @xmath13 .",
    "* @xmath31 : the geodesic in @xmath0 or @xmath21 with velocity @xmath14 at time 0 .",
    "* @xmath32 : a parallel normal vector field along @xmath31 making the distinguished curvature @xmath1 with @xmath33 . * @xmath34 : the sectional curvature operator .",
    "note that @xmath35 mapping a frame to its first vector is a fiber bundle with structure group @xmath36 acting on the right ; @xmath37 is a principal bundle .",
    "the measure @xmath30 is used in place of the standard liouville measure as it has better known dynamical properties for rank 1 , nonpositively curved spaces ( see section [ sec : rank1 ] ) . in the negative curvature setting liouville measure can be used .",
    "unless otherwise specified , @xmath30 and its product with the standard measure on the fibers of @xmath24 inherited from the haar measure on @xmath38 will be the measures used in all that follows . in negative curvature , @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "are the stable and unstable foliations for the geodesic flow .      in negative curvature",
    ", brin develops the ergodic theory of frame flows as summarized below . in section [ sec : rank1 ] we will discuss how suitable portions of this setup can be generalized to the rank 1 setting .",
    "first , the frame flow also gives rise to stable and unstable foliations @xmath39 and @xmath40 of @xmath24 as shown by brin ( see @xcite prop .",
    "brin notes that the existence of these foliations can be established in two ways , either by applying the work of brin and pesin on partially hyperbolic systems or by utilizing the exponential approach of asymptotic geodesics . in the second approach the leaves of the foliation are constructed explicitly - they sit above the stable / unstable leaves for the geodesic flow , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in the same leaf if the distance between @xmath43 and @xmath44 goes to zero as @xmath45 for the stable leaves , or @xmath46 for the unstable leaves . here",
    "we present a proposition that makes possible this definition of @xmath47 by establishing that frames asymptotic to @xmath41 exist and are unique .",
    "the proof follows the sketch given by brin in @xcite .",
    "[ prop : leaf ] let @xmath14 be a unit tangent vector and let @xmath41 be a @xmath25-frame with first vector @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath48 ( respectively @xmath49 ) so that the distance between @xmath50 and @xmath51 goes to zero exponentially fast as @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) . then there exists a unique @xmath25-frame @xmath42 with first vector @xmath52 such that the distance between @xmath43 and @xmath44 goes to zero as @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) .",
    "note that in a compact , negatively curved any two asymptotic vectors approach each other exponentially fast so this proposition allows us to define all leaves of the foliation . in rank 1",
    "spaces this may no longer be the case ; thus we have added exponential approach as a hypothesis to the proposition as it will be used for the rank 1 case later in the paper .",
    "assume @xmath48 ; the unstable case is analogous .",
    "uniqueness of the limit is simple since it is clear that two different frames can not both approach @xmath41 .",
    "we thus have only to show existence .",
    "for @xmath53 large enough , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are very close to each other , and then for every frame @xmath54 with first vector @xmath50 there exists a unique frame , call it @xmath55 , which minimizes the distance from @xmath54 among frames with first vector @xmath51 .",
    "thus to approximate the unique frame @xmath42 we are looking for , consider the frames @xmath56 .",
    "we want to show that the @xmath57 have a limit as @xmath45 ; this limit will clearly be our @xmath42 .",
    "consider the sequence @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "since the frame flow is smooth , by choosing large enough @xmath60 the difference between the frame flow along the segments @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] can be made arbitrarily small , and thus if the @xmath58 have a limit , it must be a limit for the @xmath57 . again",
    ", since the frame flow is smooth and since the distance between the geodesics decreases exponentially fast , the distance @xmath63 goes to zero exponentially fast as well .",
    "note then that @xmath64 .",
    "as the summands go to zero exponentially fast the last sum shown converges and given @xmath65 one can pick @xmath66 so large that this tail sum is less than @xmath67 . then we see that the @xmath58 form a cauchy sequence so they have a limit as desired .",
    "let @xmath68 be the map from the fiber of @xmath24 over @xmath14 to the fiber over @xmath52 that takes each @xmath41 to @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath68 corresponds to a unique isometry between @xmath70 and @xmath71 and commutes with the right action of @xmath36 . for most of this paper",
    "we will consider the maps @xmath68 acting on 2-frames .",
    "one can think of @xmath72 as the result of parallel transporting @xmath41 along @xmath31 out to the boundary at infinity of @xmath21 and then back to @xmath52 along @xmath73 . if @xmath52 and @xmath14 belong to the same leaf of @xmath29 there is similarly an isometry corresponding to parallel translation to the boundary at infinity along @xmath74 and back along @xmath75 .",
    "we will also denote this isometry by @xmath68 . in the spirit of brin ( see @xcite defn .",
    "4.4 ) we define the transitivity group at @xmath14 as follows :    given any sequence @xmath76 with @xmath77 such that each pair @xmath78 lies on the same leaf of @xmath28 or @xmath29 we have an isomorphism of @xmath70 given by @xmath79 the closure of the group generated by all such isometries is denoted by @xmath18 and is called the transitivity group .",
    "the idea of the transitivity group is that it is generated by isometries coming from parallel translation around ideal polygons in @xmath21 with an even number of sides , such as the one shown in figure [ fig : rectangle ] .    ]",
    "note that this definition differs slightly from that in brin s work .",
    "brin requires that @xmath80 and thus there is no @xmath81 term in his formula for @xmath82 brin proves that his group describes the ergodic components of the frame flow .",
    "he shows in @xcite that the ergodic components are subbundles of @xmath24 with structure group a closed subgroup of @xmath38 , now acting from the left ( see also @xcite section 5 for an overview ) .",
    "in addition , his proof demonstrates that the structure group for the ergodic component is the transitivity group ( see @xcite remark 2 or @xcite proposition 2 ) .",
    "note that the action of @xmath18 can be taken to be a left action as it commutes with the @xmath36 action of the structure group .",
    "this can be seen from noting that @xmath83 for any @xmath84 in the structure group , and that these maps define the transitivity group .",
    "the proof that this group gives the ergodic components follows the hopf argument for ergodicity , showing that the ergodic component is preserved under motion along stable and unstable leaves , and using the birkhoff ergodic theorem to show that switching from stable to unstable also preserves the component .",
    "the transitivity group as defined here is certainly at least as large as that defined by brin . on the other hand , the addition of the @xmath81 term here certainly preserves the ergodic components so this group still describes ergodic components and therefore is , in the end , the same as brin s .",
    "the advantage to this formulation of the definition is that it allows all ideal polygons , not just those that are ` equilateral ' in the sense that they can be traversed only by following leaves of the foliations .",
    "the explicit geometric description of the ergodic components given here is the central inspiration for our proof .",
    "we use two results on the ergodicity of the 2-frame flow in our proof .",

    "theorem [ thm : bk ] is not directly stated as above in @xcite , rather it follows from remarks made in section 2 of that paper together with proposition 2.9 and the extensive estimates carried out in the later sections .",
    "the following dynamical lemma is one of the main tools in our proof .",
    "it will be used in the proof of lemma [ lemma : existence ] and in the arguments of section [ sec : trans ] .",

    "since @xmath86 is recurrent we can take an increasing sequence @xmath91 tending to infinity such that @xmath92 approaches @xmath93 .",

    "@xmath38 is compact , so the @xmath112 have convergent subsequences .",
    "in addition , since the terms of this sequence are all iterates of a single element , we can , by adjusting terms of such a subsequence by suitable negative powers of @xmath84 , have the subsequence converge to the identity .",

    "in this section we discuss some details of the extension to rank 1 , nonpositively curved spaces , and note how the necessary results on the dynamics of the frame flow can be appropriated to this situation .",
    "first we discuss the measure of maximal entropy @xmath30 .",
    "this measure was developed for rank 1 spaces by knieper @xcite and is constructed there as follows .",
    "let @xmath118 be the patterson - sullivan measures on @xmath119 .",
    "fix any @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the set of pairs @xmath122 in @xmath119 that can be connected by a geodesic .",
    "then @xmath123 defines a measure on @xmath121 ; @xmath124 is a positive function which can be chosen to make the measure invariant under @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath126 be the projection @xmath127 .",

    "we need three key facts about this measure .",
    "first , @xmath30 is ergodic for the geodesic flow ( see @xcite theorem 4.4 ) .",
    "second , @xmath30 has full support .",
    "this follows from the facts that @xmath30 is supported on the rank 1 vectors ( see @xcite again ) and that the rank 1 vectors are dense in @xmath13 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "third , @xmath30 is absolutely continuous for the foliations @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "absolute continuity of a measure for a foliation is a way of asking that a fubini - like property hold for the foliation when integrating with respect to the measure . in our situation",
    ", we can justify fubini s theorem for this measure and the foliations @xmath28 and @xmath29 directly .",
    "up to multiplication by the positive function @xmath124 , @xmath30 is locally a product measure .",
    "variation of the set @xmath130 in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions is measured by the @xmath135 measures as well as the part of @xmath133 that measures variation normal to the geodesic flow direction when @xmath134 is a flat of dimension greater than one .",
    "the rest of the measure @xmath133 measures variation of the set @xmath130 in the geodesic flow direction . combining these measures together as a product measure with the scaling by @xmath124 yields @xmath30 , demonstrating that fubini - style arguments for this measure hold .",
    "next , we want to extend the definition of the transitivity group to rank 1 , nonpositively curved spaces spaces .",
    "the central difficulty here is that the distance between asymptotic geodesics may approach a nonzero constant .",
    "thus it is no longer clear whether foliations like @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be defined .",
    "we deal with this difficulty by avoiding defining foliations for the frame flow , but still defining maps @xmath68 used to produce a transitivity group . in section [ sec : trans ] we will show that the transitivity group preserves the distinguished parallel fields .",
    "the technical points involved in the definitions of the @xmath136 maps and the transitivity group are necessary to make that proof work .",
    "first , let @xmath137 be the set of endpoints @xmath138 of recurrent , rank 1 geodesics such that almost all geodesics ending at @xmath138 are recurrent .",
    "since recurrence and rank 1 are full measure conditions for the ergodic measure @xmath30 and @xmath30 is absolutely continuous for @xmath26 this is a full measure set of @xmath21 for any patterson - sullivan measure on @xmath21 . in particular , it is dense as the patterson - sullivan measures have full support .",

    "suppose @xmath142 and @xmath143 are not strictly asymptotic .",

    "a parallel field scaled by a solution to the real variable version of the jacobi equation ( where the standard derivative replaces the covariant derivative ) produces a jacobi field .",
    "thus , a proof under the less stringent hypothesis of weak rank implies a proof for strong rank .",
    "hamenstdt s is the sole result prior to this paper for weak rank .",
    "she states her main theorem for parallel fields only , but she shows in lemma 2.1 that in negative curvature a jacobi field making maximal curvature is a parallel field scaled by a function @xcite .",
    "essentially , she shows that jacobi fields making maximal curvature grow at precisely the rate one finds for the constant curvature case .",
    "connell accomplishes the same in @xcite lemma 2.3 .",
    "this , together with some of the arguments below , shows that these jacobi fields are in fact parallel fields scaled by an appropriate function .",
    "therefore , corollary 2 is a weak rank result , needing only the jacobi field hypothesis .    in this section",
    "we show that jacobi fields making _ minimal _ curvature with the geodesic direction are also scaled parallel fields .",
    "this will justify the phrasing of corollary 1 as a weak rank result . in this section",
    ", @xmath377 will denote the riemannian inner product and @xmath378 the curvature tensor .",
    "first , note that we need only consider non - vanishing jacobi fields ; hence it will be enough to prove that stable and unstable jacobi fields are scaled parallel fields .",
    "stable jacobi fields are those which have norm approaching zero as @xmath45 ; unstable jacobi fields have the same property in the negative time direction .",
    "suppose @xmath379 is a stable jacobi field along the geodesic @xmath86 making curvature @xmath1 with the geodesic ( take @xmath12 now ) , where @xmath1 is the curvature minimum for the manifold ( the modifications of what follows for unstable jacobi fields are straightforward ) .",
    "the rauch comparison theorem ( see @xcite chapt 10 , theorem 2.3 ) can be used to show that    @xmath380 ) . write @xmath381 where @xmath382 and @xmath383 is a unit vector field .",
    "then the jacobi equation for @xmath161 reads :    @xmath384    where @xmath385 denotes the standard derivative and @xmath386 denotes covariant derivative . taking the inner product of ( [ eq : jacobi ] ) with @xmath190 and noting that @xmath387 we obtain    @xmath388    we now know the following about the magnitude of @xmath161 : @xmath389 by definition , @xmath390 since @xmath161 is a stable jacobi field , and @xmath391 by ( [ eq : simpjacobi ] ) .",
    "these allow the following conclusion ; its proof was shown to the author by jeffrey rauch :    [ rauchlemma ] let @xmath392 be a non - negative , real valued function satifsying @xmath391 and @xmath390",
    ". then @xmath393 .",
    "we have that @xmath394 on the interval @xmath395 for @xmath396 define @xmath397 by @xmath398 , @xmath399 and @xmath400 .",
    "note that as @xmath401 , @xmath402 .",
    "we claim that @xmath403 ; the lemma follows in the limit .",
    "this claim is essentially the maximum principle .",
    "first , @xmath403 holds at @xmath404 and @xmath242 .",
    "now suppose @xmath405 has a positive maximum at @xmath406 .",
    "then @xmath407 . however , we know @xmath408 , so a positive value of @xmath405 at @xmath159 together with a negative value of @xmath409 yields a contradiction .",
    "therefore @xmath403 holds on all of @xmath410 $ ] as desired .",
    "this lemma , together with equation ( [ eq : geq ] ) , tells us that @xmath411 . examining equation ( [ eq : simpjacobi ] ) we see that having the growth rate @xmath412 , as in the constant curvature @xmath1 case , implies that @xmath413 ,",
    "that is , @xmath161 is a scaled parallel field , as desired .",
    "in this section we discuss how the results of connell in @xcite can be adapted to prove theorem 2 as a simple consequence of corollary 1 .",
    "the necessary changes are for the most part cosmetic ; the discussion here is included for completeness , but the author does not claim to have added anything of substance to connell s work .",
    "the notation below that has not already been assigned follows connell s for ease of reference .",
    "recall that lyapunov exponents are a tool for measuring long - term asympotic growth rates in dynamical systems ( see katok and mendoza s supplement to @xcite section s.2 for an exposition ) . in the setting of the geodesic flow",
    "they can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath229 and @xmath414 .",
    "let @xmath415 be the unstable jacobi field along @xmath146 with initial condition @xmath416 .",
    "then , the _ positive lyapunov exponent at @xmath14 in the @xmath417-direction _ is @xmath418 define @xmath419 this is the maximal lyapunov exponent at @xmath14 ; the curvature bound @xmath420 ( again , take @xmath421 ) implies that @xmath422 .",
    "let @xmath423 we can now rephrase theorem 2 more succinctly .    let @xmath0 be a compact manifold with sectional curvature @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that @xmath203 has full measure with respect to a geodesic flow - invariant measure @xmath30 with full support . if @xmath0 is odd dimensional , or if @xmath0 is even dimensional and satisfies the sectional curvature pinching condition @xmath16 with @xmath17 then @xmath0 is of constant curvature @xmath1 .",
    "connell shows in the upper rank case that the dynamical assumption implies the geometric one , that is , that the manifold in fact has higher rank , allowing the application of an appropriate rank rigidity theorem .",
    "he first shows ( @xcite proposition 2.4 ) that along a closed geodesic @xmath424 implies the existence of an unstable jacobi field making curvature @xmath1 with the geodesic direction .",
    "essentially , if the jacobi field giving rise to the lyapunov exponent does not have this curvature , it will continually see non - extremal curvature a positive fraction of the time as it moves around the closed geodesic .",
    "this contradicts the supposed value of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "the lower curvature bound version of the argument is exactly the same as that presented by connell , with the proper inequalities reversed ; also note that the work in section [ sec : parallel ] of this paper gives the results analogous to connell s lemma 2.3 necessary for the argument .",
    "it is clear that if a dense set of geodesics have the distinguished jacobi fields , then all geodesics will .",
    "since the velocity vectors for closed geodesics are dense in @xmath13 , connell finishes his proof in section 3 of @xcite by showing that these vectors are all in @xmath203 and using the argument of the previous paragraph . adapted to the setting of theorem 2 the argument runs as follows .",
    "if @xmath425 is tangent to a closed geodesic and @xmath426 the previous paragraph implies that any unstable jacobi field along @xmath281 must make curvature strictly greater than @xmath1 a positive fraction of the time . by continuity , this will also be true of any unstable jacobi field along a geodesic @xmath146 in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath281 ( in the sasaki metric on @xmath13 ) .",
    "the ergodic theorem implies that for a full measure set of @xmath229 , @xmath146 will spend a positive fraction of its life in this small neighborhood of the periodic geodesic @xmath281 ; the positivity follows from the fact that @xmath30 has full support .",
    "the intersection of this full measure set with the full measure set @xmath203 thus contains vectors @xmath14 which have @xmath424 but spend a positive fraction of their life so close to @xmath281 that no jacobi fields along them can make the minimal curvature @xmath1 with the geodesic direction during this fraction of the time .",
    "in fact , since @xmath281 is compact , so is the closure of this small neighborhood and therefore the curvature between these jacobi fields and the geodesics , when in this neighborhood , can be bounded away from @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath427 for a fixed @xmath159 . having this curvature bound a positive fraction of the time contradicts @xmath424 ; therefore all closed geodesics must lie in @xmath203 and the argument is complete .",
    "again , this version of the argument , relevant for the lower curvature bound situation , is the same as that presented by connell with the proper inequalities reversed .",
    "thus , the dynamical assumption implies the geometric assumption of corollary 1 and theorem 2 follows .",
    "note that for these arguments the extremality of the distinguished curvature is essential and we do not obtain a result that parallels theorem 1 in allowing non - extremal distinguished curvature .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks on possible extension of this work .",
    "note that in even dimension a result directly parallel to our odd dimensional result can not be hoped for .",
    "since parallel translation preserves the complex structure on a khler manifold the 2-frame flow will not be ergodic ( see @xcite for some results on unitary frame bundles ) .",
    "these known counterexamples to ergodic frame flow are excluded by requiring @xmath428 , leading brin to conjecture that strict 1/4-pinching implies that the frame flow is ergodic ( @xcite conjecture 2.6 ) . a positive answer to this conjecture , or any",
    "extended results for ergodicity of the 2-frame flow in negative curvature would extend the results on rank rigidity presented here correspondingly , using the same proof as presented above .",
    "one still hopes that lower hyperbolic rank rigidity ( in the sense that higher rank implies the space is locally symmetric ) could be true without any curvature pinching in even dimensions , and the result here as well as the extensive analogous results for the other rank rigidity theorems seem to make such a theorem more likely .",
    "however , such a result would call for a significantly different method of proof from that presented here ."
