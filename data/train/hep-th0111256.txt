    "it is still a challenging and unsolved problem to prove quark confinement in the framework of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "a very beginning question in deriving quark confinement is in what sense quark is confined ?",
    "a simple criterion of quark confinement which has been widely used so far is the area law decay of the wilson loop ( defined by the vacuum expectation value of the wilson loop operator ) .",
    "the area law implies the presence of a linear piece @xmath10 proportional to the interquark distance @xmath11 in the static interquark potential @xmath12 .",
    "the dual superconductivity of qcd vacuum @xcite is one of the most promising mechanisms of quark confinement in compatible with this picture .",
    "however , it is well known that this criterion is not so useful in the presence of dynamical matter , since the interquark force is screened by a pair of quark and anti - quark created from the vacuum and the linear piece no longer appears in the potential .    in the previous paper @xcite , one of the authors ( k",
    "k. ) has proposed a non - vanishing vacuum condensate @xmath13 of mass dimension 2 as the origin of mass gap and quark confinement in yang - mills theory .",
    "the proposed composite operator of mass dimension 2 is given by @xmath14 , \\label{combi}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the gauge field , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the ghost ( anti - ghost ) field and @xmath18 denotes the volume of the @xmath19-dimensional spacetime .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the composite operator @xmath20 is invariant under the becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) @xcite and anti - brst @xcite transformations in the manifestly lorentz covariant gauge , especially in the most general .",
    "the resulting gauge fixing term has two parameters .",
    "the conventional lorentz gauge is obtained as a special choice of the parameters . ]",
    "lorentz gauge @xcite and the maximal abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite . in ( [ combi ] ) , the trace is taken over the broken generators of the lie algebra @xmath21 of the original group @xmath22 when the original gauge group @xmath22 is broken to @xmath23 by a local gauge fixing condition chosen , i.e , @xmath22 itself in the lorentz gauge and @xmath24 in the ma gauge corresponding to the maximal torus group @xmath23 of @xmath22 .",
    "especially , in the limit @xmath25 ( which we call the landau gauge ) , the composite operator reduces to @xmath26 $ ] and hence it becomes gauge invariant , since the contribution from the ghost and anti - ghost disappears .",
    "the vacuum condensate includes the ghost condensation proposed in the ma gauge @xcite and reduces to the gluon condensation proposed recently by several authors @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the physical implication of the existence of such a condensate @xmath13 has been argued based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) of the gluon and ghost propagators ( 2-point functions ) and the vertex function ( 3-point function ) @xcite .",
    "however , the actual calculation has been performed within the tree level .    in order for such a proposal to be meaningful",
    ", it is very indispensable to show that the whole strategy to derive quark confinement based on the novel vacuum condensate survives the renormalization . in view of this , we focus on the renormalization of the composite operator ( [ combi ] ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to examine whether or not the composite operator in the integrand of @xmath20 is renormalizable .",
    "in addition , we must clarify the meaning of the brst and anti - brst symmetry in the renormalized theory .",
    "we examine whether or not the renormalized composite operator @xmath27 is invariant under the renormalized brst and anti - brst transformation . if this is the case , the proposed composite operator of mass dimension 2 and the corresponding vacuum condensate can have a definite physical meaning .",
    "the analysis of this paper is restricted to the most general lorentz gauge fixing , since the analysis of the ma gauge is more involved and hence the result is to be reported in a separate paper @xcite .    in the most general lorentz gauge , the multiplicative renormalizability of the yang - mills theory has been worked out by baulieu and thierry - mieg @xcite by making use of the slavnov - taylor identities characterizing the brst and anti - brst invariance of the theory ( see textbooks and reviews , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the course of renormalizing the composite operator , however , there is a subtle problem of the operator mixing . in order to discuss the renormalization of a composite operator",
    ", we must take into account all the contributions coming from all the other composite operators of the same mass dimension and the same symmetry property . in the ope",
    ", the wilson coefficient corresponding to arbitrary vacuum condensate can be calculated by the perturbation theory . in the usual lorentz gauge , the wilson coefficient associated with the ghost condensate @xmath28 in the ope of the propagator vanishes identically due to a special property of the 3-point gluon - ghost - anti  ghost vertex as pointed out in @xcite . in the most general lorentz gauge @xcite ,",
    "however , we show in this paper that the operator mixing between two composite operators , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , of mass dimension 2 does exist in general due to the presence of four - ghost interaction ( except for the case which is reduced to the conventional lorentz gauge ) .",
    "we explicitly calculate the matrix of renormalization factors of the composite operator in the one - loop level .    for the landau gauge ,",
    "the vacuum condensate of mass dimension 2 in yang - mills theory is nothing but the gluon pair condensation .",
    "a possibility of gluon pair condensation was already suggested from the existence of the tachyon pole in the two gluon channel by solving approximately the bethe - salpeter equation , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a gluon pair can be identified as a cooper pair , that is a bound state caused by the attractive force .",
    "hence the gluon condensation is regarded as the bose condensation of the gluon with spin 1 .",
    "a remarkable point of our treatment different from the previous one is to retain the manifest lorentz covariance and gauge ( or brst and anti - brst ) invariance .",
    "hence the introduction of ghost field is indispensable in this approach .",
    "it is important to clarify how the inclusion of the ghost influences the dynamics of gluon to recover the gauge invariance .",
    "this paper is a preliminary work toward the complete understanding of this problem .",
    "another purpose of this paper is to point out that the composite operator discussed above has the analog in the abelian gauge theory , especially , quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "this suggests that a confinement phase can exist even in qed probably in the strong coupling region @xcite . in qed",
    ", the vacuum condensate in question is reduced in the landau gauge to the photon pairing .",
    "the photon pairing has also been suggested long ago by solving the cooper equation , see @xcite . from quite a different viewpoint ,",
    "one of the authors @xcite discussed the existence of a confinement phase in qed based on the total qed lagrangian with the brst and anti - brst invariant gauge fixing term which is identical to the usual lagrangian in the lorentz gauge up to a total derivative term .",
    "an advantage of rewriting the the gauge fixing part of the lagrangian into the brst and anti - brst exact form is that the hidden supersymmetry becomes manifest and that the gauge - fixing part in four spacetime dimensions is reduced to the @xmath31 non - linear sigma model in two spacetime dimensions owing to the parisi - sourlas dimensional reduction . in view of this , the ghost is indispensable in this approach even for the abelian gauge theory where the ghost decouples and is usually considered to be unnecessary . in the analysis of quark confinement ,",
    "it is most important to understand the origin of the scale or the mechanism of mass generation which was not so clear in the previous treatments .",
    "the detailed analysis of this issue will be reported in a subsequent paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we summarize the brst and anti - brst transformations and their properties which are necessary in the following analyses .    in section 3 ,",
    "we examine how the renormalization in qed is performed so as to preserve the brst and anti - brst symmetry .",
    "this section is a preliminary step for dealing with the non - abelian gauge theory in the subsequent sections .    in section 4",
    ", we consider the most general lagrangian of the yang - mills theory which has manifest lorentz covariance , global gauge invariance and brst and anti - brst symmetry .",
    "the gauge fixing term contains two gauge fixing parameters .",
    "we give feynman rules of this theory and calculate the renormalization constants in the one - loop level .",
    "although some materials in this section are a reconfirmation of the results obtained by baulieu and thierry - mieg @xcite , it is necessary to make this paper self - contained and to give basic ingredients in the subsequent sections .    in section 5",
    ", we obtain the renormalization group flow in the parameter space of the theory .",

    "the nilpotency of the on - shell brst and anti - brst transformation is realized only when the equation of motion for the ghost and anti - ghost field is used , since    @xmath59    and    @xmath60    moreover , we obtain the similar result for the anti - commutability :    @xmath61    now we define the composite operator @xmath20 of mass dimension 2 by @xmath62 this composite operator is brst and anti - brst invariant , since @xmath63    we consider the renormalization of the composite operator @xmath64 .",
