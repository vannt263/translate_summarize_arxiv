    "recently , for the first time in over twenty years , several narrow hadronic resonances have been discovered .",
    "examples are an @xmath0 @xmath1-wave , the @xmath2 , the @xmath3 , the @xmath4 and also new charmed baryons .",
    "some findings were particularly embarrassing for theorists , such as the @xmath5 , the @xmath6 and the @xmath7 , whose masses and properties were not anticipated . of course , in retrospect everyone can explain anything .",
    "the power of post diction is symptomatic for our lack of understanding of strong interaction dynamics .",
    "this is further illustrated by the now fading pentaquark - hype .",
    "what are the relevant degrees of freedom for the classification of hadronic excitations ?",
    "are angular and radial excitations of quark model states sufficient to obtain a qualitative picture or do we have to include hybrid- and molecules ( i.e. meson - meson and/or tetraquark states ) as well ? ( how ) can we make quantitative predictions of masses and strong decay rates ?",
    "charmonia offer an exciting arena for improving theoretical tools and experimental techniques . in some aspects charm quarks can be classed as `` heavy '' . nonetheless , with relative valence quark velocities @xmath8 and binding energies @xmath9 , it is clear that corrections to an effective heavy quark field theory description can be large : ultimately there is no short - cut to the inclusion of non - perturbative low energy qcd effects .",
    "what we learn from charmonia will to a large extent also apply to light hadron spectroscopy . however , ( potential ) non - relativistic qcd ( ( p)nrqcd ) expectations can still serve as a starting point .",
    "also potential models with phenomenologically fitted parameters appear to describe many features reasonably well and it needs to be clarified to what extent these are connected to qcd as the fundamental theory .",
    "quark model states ( standard ) while others do not appear to fit into the expected pattern ( ? ? ? ? ? ) .,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    -.5 cm    due to the spatial compactness of charmonium wavefunctions we encounter the luxury of finding many narrow resonances below strong decay thresholds . also above such thresholds",
    "the situation is still much cleaner than it is in the light quark sector . while this applies even more so to bottomonia , in the @xmath0 case , production in @xmath10 machines is limited to vector states and their decay products .",
    "not even the @xmath11 meson has been detected thus far !",
    "furthermore , the @xmath12 threshold region is elusive .",
    "some information could be gained by scans above @xmath13 and runs at @xmath14 in a future super-@xmath15 factory . nonetheless , the prospects in @xmath0 spectroscopy are quite bleak due to the small hadronic production cross sections and the unavailability of a top - meson that could produce @xmath0 states in its decay . in the charm - sector",
    "however many new states have been discovered recently , some in @xmath16 collisions at fnal , others in @xmath17 production and decays at cleo and many by the @xmath15 factories , mostly in @xmath15 decays .",
    "a summary of these recent findings is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "10 resonances have been discovered 1974  1977 , none in 1978  2001 and eight ( ! ) since 2002 . for recent reviews of the properties of these new states , see e.g.ref.@xcite",
    "most hadronic resonances undergo strong decays . this situation is hard to study on the lattice and requires repeating the simulation on different ( and large ) physical volumes . fortunately , most charmonia are very narrow .",
    "the states above 3900 mev however have widths ranging from @xmath20  mev to @xmath21  mev .",
    "a model with strong decays switched off can serve as a starting point for investigations of the more involved realistic situation .",
    "this can be achieved by switching sea quark effects off completely .",
    "studies in this so - called quenched approximation have been performed by a variety of collaborations , with an anisotropy parameter@xcite @xmath22 and keeping spatial and temporal lattice resolution the same,@xcite @xmath23 .    for charmonia , @xmath24 , where the mass @xmath25 is calculated in units of @xmath26 and the wavefunction extent @xmath27 in units of @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , introducing an anisotropy appears to allows for a smaller number of lattice points and hence a reduction in the computational effort .",
    "however , quantum corrections considerably reduce the naive gain factor .",
    "also there is some overhead from the nonperturbative matching of fermionic and gluonic anisotropies , which is particularly delicate when sea quarks are included .",
    "nevertheless , a pilot study with @xmath29 and @xmath30 already exists.@xcite    we summarize the quenched situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : chquench ] .",
    "the columbia@xcite and cp - pacs@xcite results are extrapolated to the continuum limit .",
    "similar results for a smaller number of states have been obtained by the guangzhou group@xcite and qcd - taro.@xcite it is reassuring that the latter study on isotropic lattices confirms the anisotropic results .",
    "the scale @xmath31  mev is set from potential models .",
    "a systematic scale error of about 10 % should be assumed , for stable states that do not mix !",
    "one often thinks of the charm quark as heavy in the sense that its mass is bigger than typical qcd binding energies .",
    "however , the spectrum of states entirely made out of glue covers a similar energy range . to illustrate this",
    "we have superimposed these glueballs@xcite onto the figure .",
    "note that for the lattice results displayed , effects of diagrams with disconnected quark lines have been neglected .",
    "one might expect ozi violating contributions from these , for instance for states that lie close to glueballs with the same quantum numbers or close to decay thresholds .",
    "also ( tiny ) effects from the axial anomaly or from @xmath32 mixing can not be excluded .",
    "the impact of such diagrams on the vector and pseudoscalar channels has been studied by mcneile and michael@xcite and by cp - pacs@xcite and found to be insignificant within errors of about 20  mev .",
    "the figure also contains the lightest two spin - exotic @xmath33-gluon hybrids.@xcite again , the results agree with other studies.@xcite it is also possible to employ hybrid sources with non - exotic quantum numbers .",
    "states prepared in this way are found to decay rapidly in euclidean time into the respective non - hybrid ground states@xcite which is hardly surprising , given the fact that one expects an energy gap of about 1.4  gev when solving the schrdinger equation with ground state and hybrid lattice potentials as input",
    ". however , the extent of spectroscopic hybrid components in charmonium wavefunctions deserves further study.@xcite similarly , it is difficult to disentangle @xmath34 and @xmath1 waves in lattice simulations of the @xmath35 sector.@xcite    when sea quarks are switched on , would - be glueballs , standard charmonia and @xmath36 molecules will mix ( as will exotic hybrid charmonia and molecules ) .",
    "this has not yet been studied on the lattice .",
    "in addition , one would expect the fine structure to be particularly sensitive to the sea quark content .",
    "for instance , the @xmath34 wave singlet - triplet splitting in nrqcd reads , @xmath37 where @xmath38 to leading order in perturbative qcd .",
    "due to the short - distance nature of this term one would expect significant finite @xmath39 effects .",
    "moreover , with sea quarks included , the running of @xmath40 will slow down such that at high momenta / short distances @xmath41 will maintain a relatively larger value . in ref.@xcite",
    "this effect is estimated to amount to 3040  % .    indeed , setting the scale from @xmath42 , a splitting of only @xmath43 mev is found.@xcite when adjusting the lattice spacing to the @xmath44 splitting instead",
    ", the central value increases to @xmath45  mev , still short of the experimental @xmath46  mev .",
    "this result is consistent with refs.@xcite while in small volume studies at one lattice spacing@xcite and at a too small charm quark mass@xcite higher results have been obtained .",
    "the fnal and milc@xcite collaborations indeed find the @xmath47 splitting to increase to @xmath48 and @xmath49 mev at lattice spacings @xmath50 and 2.3  gev , respectively , in studies with@xcite @xmath51 sea quark flavours .",
    "note however that there are theoretical doubts about the validity of milc s fermion approach .",
    "also , disconnected quark line diagrams have not yet been included .",
    "while their impact is likely to be small effects of up to 20  mev can not be excluded.@xcite",
    "in order to match experimental resonances to theoretical predictions ultimately one has to go beyond the mass spectrum .",
    "for instance one would expect hybrids and molecules to couple differently to decay and production channels than states with quark model dominance .",
    "gaining information on strong decay rates from lattice simulations , without additional assumptions , is complicated .",
    "however , calculating electromagnetic ( em ) decay and transition rates is in principle straight - forward . for narrow states such predictions",
    "can directly be confronted with experiment . for broad states above threshold , where data on em transitions is lacking",
    ", a knowledge of the wavefunction will reveal qualitative information on possible production mechanisms .",
    "matrix element @xmath52 , together with @xmath53 , extracted from experiment.@xcite , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    qcd - taro@xcite calculated electric quarkonium wavefunctions . in the non - relativistic approximation , the em decay constant is to leading order proportional to the wavefunction at the origin .",
    "dudek and edwards directly calculated two - photon decay rates@xcite as well as the decay constants@xcite @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these studies have been performed at one lattice spacing on small volumes in the quenched approximation and with a charm quark mass about 5  % smaller than the physical one .",
    "in particular the calculations of this pilot study of em transition rates are extremely promising .",
    "for instance the m1 transition rate @xmath56 contains the term @xmath52 at @xmath57 .",
    "this decomposes into a kinematical factor , multiplied by the three point function , @xmath58 , that can be calculated on the lattice . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dudek ] we display the lattice prediction@xcite of @xmath59 , obtained for different momentum transfers @xmath60 , together with the @xmath57 value derived from the experimentally measured transition rate .",
    "this expectation was phenomenologically corrected for the mis - adjusted lattice charm quark mass ( lat .",
    "mass ) to facilitate the comparison : the lattice @xmath61-extrapolation appears very reasonable .",
    "the transition @xmath62 was studied too as were @xmath63 and @xmath64  kev .",
    "the latter rate is a prediction since cleo only detected the cascade @xmath65 where both individual rates are unknown .",
    "it is evident that states close to decay thresholds like the @xmath7 or the @xmath66 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spec ] ) will couple to molecular @xmath36 or @xmath67 components , respectively . at present there exist no meaningful direct lattice studies of such @xmath68 mixing phenomena . ideally one would create and destroy states using an extended basis of operators , including molecules and hybrids , to study their mixing .",
    "energy levels and mixing angle for @xmath29.@xcite , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    energy levels and mixing angle for @xmath29.@xcite , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the absence of such an investigation , one might benefit from the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "at least qualitatively charmonia can be described by potential models .",
    "the @xmath69 sector can be extended to include @xmath70 potentials .",
    "@xmath71 denotes a static ( heavy ) quark and @xmath72 .",
    "this situation has recently been studied on the lattice,@xcite albeit only at one lattice spacing @xmath73  fm and with @xmath29 mass - degenerate sea quark flavours , slightly lighter than the strange quark .",
    "we denote the physical eigenstates by @xmath74 .",
    "these can be decomposed , @xmath75 the resulting energy levels and mixing angle @xmath76 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mixing ] as a function of the @xmath69-separation @xmath27 .    at @xmath77",
    "fm the @xmath69 string breaks and the ground state is dominated by the @xmath70 configuration .",
    "interestingly , also at @xmath78 there is a significant four - quark admixture in the ground state .",
    "this 4  % probability is consistent with the large four - quark components found in phenomenological models of charmonia and bottomonia.@xcite in ref.@xcite the action and energy density distributions around the static sources have been investigated : string breaking appears to be an instantaneous process with no spatial localization of the light @xmath79 pair that is created .",
    "this suggests an @xmath80 hamiltonian with a transition term @xmath81 that only depends on the distance @xmath27",
    ".    one can include @xmath70 effects as quantum mechanical perturbations,@xcite starting from an unperturbed @xmath69 wave function @xmath82 . by summing over all possible intermediate states @xmath83 where @xmath84 can be in both sectors",
    ", @xmath70 and @xmath69 , one ends up with complex hamiltonian for each state .",
    "the solution of the corresponding schrdinger problem yields both : the respective energy levels and decay widths .",
    "a study of the sea quark mass dependence of the static energy levels is as yet lacking .",
    "the bands in the left plot of fig .  [ fig : mixing ] represent an @xmath85 speculation . in this case string breaking will occur at a somewhat smaller distance , @xmath86  fm , the gap @xmath87 will be larger and moreover there will be a second string breaking threshold @xmath88",
    ". it would be interesting to see , once the sea quark mass dependence has been established , if properties of @xmath7 and @xmath66 can be reproduced or if the present overpopulation of the @xmath35 sector can be explained by coupled channel models , based on such lattice potentials .",
    "we have arrived at a good understanding of the spectrum of states in the mass region , 2.5  5 gev , in the quenched approximation to qcd , including glueballs and @xmath33-glue hybrid states , besides standard charmonia .",
    "however , information on four - quark states is still lacking and there is some uncertainty regarding the size of contributions due to diagrams with disconnected quark lines .",
    "electromagnetic decay and transition rates have been calculated successfully in a pilot study .",
    "studies of @xmath18 qcd set the stage for more realistic @xmath19 simulations .",
    "promising @xmath51 results have been obtained , indicating a convergence of low lying states towards experiment , once sea quarks are included . over the next few years",
    "such simulations will be extended to include more realistic sea quarks and a broader basis of operators to create states , including four - quark and hybrid operators . in the meantime",
    "one has to resort to coupled channel models to understand threshold effects .",
    "these can be refined by using input from lattice simulations .",
    "ultimately , one would wish to arrive at qcd predictions of strong decay rates .",
    "this is very hard to achieve by a direct lattice computation but again , the predictive power of models can benefit from dedicated lattice tests and comparisons .",
    "last but not least i hope that these exciting times will continue with further experimental discoveries .",
