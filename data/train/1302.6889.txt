    "low - lying baryons are classified into the spin 1/2 octet and spin 3/2 decuplet by quark models and quantum chromodynamincs ( qcd ) .",
    "the electromagnetic structure of the octet ( @xmath3 ) and decuplet ( @xmath4 ) baryons , or the @xmath5 transition , can be characterized by their electromagnetic form factors .",
    "these form factors encode the microscopic quark and gluon qcd substructure of the baryons , but can also be represented in terms of the effective degrees of freedom , such as the baryon cores dressed by meson clouds .    although there is abundant experimental information on the nucleon electromagnetic structure and the @xmath1 transition form factors  @xcite , in particular , the studies of the other possible octet to decuplet electromagnetic transition form factors involving the strange baryons ( baryons with one or more strange quarks ) , are nearly nonexistent . (",
    "the scarce of the data can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . ) in the past , several theoretical studies of the octet to decuplet electromagnetic transitions were performed in nonrelativistic and relativistic quark models  @xcite , skyrme and soliton models  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite , chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , large @xmath6 limit  @xcite , algebraic models of hadron structure  @xcite , and lattice qcd  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "lattice qcd studies for the @xmath7 reaction can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of the @xmath5 transition is very important to understand the role of the meson cloud . for the @xmath7 reaction ,",
    "the meson cloud contributions are shown to be crucial  @xcite .",
    "then , it is natural to investigate the role of the meson cloud also for the other octet to decuplet electromagnetic transitions . in order to understand the role of the meson cloud quantitatively , where the pion cloud is expected to be dominant ,",
    "the prerequisite is to understand the valence quark contributions quantitatively .    for this purpose , we rely on the covariant spectator quark model  @xcite , since it was successful in the studies of the electromagnetic structure of nucleon  @xcite , octet and decuplet baryons  @xcite , transition form factors of the reactions @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10  @xcite , and others  @xcite .",
    "we follow the formalism developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the octet baryons , and that in ref .",
    "@xcite for the decuplet baryons . in these works",
    ", the covariant spectator quark model was extended from the @xmath11 to the @xmath0 scheme for the lattice qcd regime , and then extrapolated back to the physical regime .",
    "we also follow closely the study made for the @xmath7 transition based on an s - state approach to describe the nucleon and @xmath12 systems  @xcite utilizing the @xmath0 meson - baryon coupling scheme . however , as is well known , the contributions solely from the valence quarks are insufficient to describe the observed cross sections and the extracted form factors for the @xmath7 reaction ( especially @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , explicit pion cloud effects for the other @xmath5 reactions involving the strange baryons should also be considered by extending the @xmath7 treatment based on an @xmath0 symmetry scheme , and this is done in the present study .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ secsqm ] we present the covariant spectator quark model , including the parametrizations for the octet and decuplet baryon wave functions , and the quark electromagnetic current .",
    "results of the form factors , both for the valence quark and pion cloud contributions , are presented in sec .",
    "[ secff ] .",
    "[ secresults ] is devoted for the final results and discussions .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ secconclusions ] .",
    "the covariant spectator quark model was derived from the covariant spectator theory  @xcite . in the model a baryon is described as a 3-constituent quark system , where one quark is free to interact with the electromagnetic fields and a pair of non - interacting quarks is treated as a single on - mass - shell spectator particle ( diquark ) with an effective mass @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the quark current is parameterized based on a vector meson dominance mechanism as explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the baryon wave function depends on the baryon momentum @xmath15 , the diquark momentum @xmath16 , the flavor indices and the spin projections , as will be shown later .",
    "the wave function is constructed conveniently by the symmetrized states of the diquark pair ( 12 ) , and the off - mass - shell quark 3 .",
    "the transition current can be calculated in terms of the quark-3 states . to obtain the final , total contribution , we may multiply by a factor 3 , the current associated with the quark 3 .",
    "the covariant spectator quark model was also generalized to the lattice qcd regime with heavy pions , where the meson cloud effects are expected to be very small  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the same parametrization in the model holds for both the physical and the lattice qcd regimes , gives us some confidence that the valence quark contributions calculated in the model are well under control .",
    "next , we will present the wave functions of the octet and decuplet baryons in the covariant spectator quark model .",
    "we will use @xmath17 and @xmath18 for the octet and decuplet baryon masses , respectively , and @xmath19 for the nucleon mass .",
    "in general the octet baryon wave function ( spin 1/2 ) in an s - state for the quark - diquark system , can be written as  @xcite , _",
    "b(p , k ) = \\ { _ s^0 |m_a + _ s^1 |m_s } _",
    "b(p , k ) , [ eqpsib ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the flavor antisymmetric and symmetric wave functions , @xmath22 are the spin ( 0 and 1 ) wave functions , and @xmath23 is the octet baryon @xmath3 radial wave function to be defined shortly .",
    "spin projection indices are suppressed for simplicity .",
    "the explicit expressions for the all octet baryon members are presented in table  [ tableoctet ] .",
    "the spin wave functions are given by : & & _ s^0 ( + ) = ( - ) , + & & _ s^1 ( + ) = - , and & & _ s^0 ( -)= ( - ) , + & & _ s^1 ( -)= . this nonrelativistic structure is generalized to a relativistic form in the covariant spectator quark model @xcite : _ s^0&= & u(p ) , + _ s^1&= & -_^ ( p ) u^(p ) , [ eqphis ] where u^(p)= _ 5 ( ^- ) u(p ) . in the above",
    "@xmath24 represents the dirac spinor of the octet baryon @xmath3 with momentum @xmath15 and spin projection @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) the diquark polarization vector in the fixed - axis representation  @xcite .",
    "again , the spin projection is suppressed in the dirac spinors .    the radial wave function @xmath28 is defined in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath29 : _ _ b= , [ eqchi ] where @xmath14 is the diquark mass . using the formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite we write @xmath28 for @xmath30 : & & _ _ n(p , k)= , [ eqpsin ] + & & _ _ ( p , k)= , + & & _ _ ( p , k)= , + & & _ _ ( p , k)= , [ eqpsix ] where @xmath31 are the normalization constants and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are the momentum range parameters in units of @xmath14 .",
    "we use the parameters determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in which we obtain natural order for the size of the baryon cores  @xcite .",
    "the octet baryon masses can be described considering the pion - baryon @xmath0 couplings .",
    "we use the experimental baryon mass values : @xmath38 gev , @xmath39 gev , @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 gev .",
    "the mass of the baryon @xmath3 in the octet can be represented as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a constant , and @xmath44 the self - energy at the pole position , that differs for the octet isomultiplet ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 )  @xcite .",
    "the self - energy is evaluated neglecting the diagrams with heavy mesons in the first approximation , and can be expressed as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a factor depending on the coupling of pion with the baryon @xmath3 , and @xmath49 is the value of the feynman integral ( with the coupling constants removed ) with the mass @xmath17 .",
    "the octet baryon masses can be reproduced with an accuracy better than 7% for the @xmath50 value @xmath51 with @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 gev  @xcite .",
    "the details of the @xmath0 couplings and coefficients @xmath48 , are presented in ref .",
