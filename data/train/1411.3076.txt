    "for one - dimensional stationary systems , the probability density function ( pdf ) can be obtained in a closed form for many cases . however , in the presence of a driving force , its time - dependent solution is rarely available even for one - dimensional systems .",
    "recent advancements in nonequilibrium theory @xcite strongly demand reliable methods for time - dependent solutions of langevin equations for systems driven by time - dependent external forces .",
    "the moment method ( mm ) is widely used to study dynamics @xcite ; it considers the time evolution of moments of pdfs [ in most cases , up to the second - order moments ( mean and variance ) are considered ] .",
    "if we truncate at the second moment ( i.e. , @xmath0th - order terms where @xmath1 are ignored ) , the number of differential equations is @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dimensionality of the model ; thus , with current computer capabilities , the mm is tractable up to relatively large @xmath3 .",
    "although the mm can provide satisfactory results for linear ( or weakly nonlinear ) systems , its applicability collapses even for simple bistable models . here ,",
    "for time - dependent solutions of langevin equations , we propose an approximation technique in which pdfs are represented by superposed multiple gaussian distributions , obtaining time - evolution equations for parameters of each of the gaussian distributions with the variational principle .",
    "we call the proposed method the variational superposed gaussian approximation ( vsga ) .",
    "dynamical gaussian approximations have a long history in quantum mechanics .",
    "heller introduced the gaussian wavepacket method @xcite , which approximates time - dependent solutions of schrdinger equations with a gaussian packet by obtaining equations for the mean and variance through the mclachlan variational principle @xcite ( other equivalent variational principles are also known @xcite and this is a special case of the weighted residual method ) . several researchers extended heller s approach to incorporate multiple gaussian distributions @xcite , and these methods can provide reliable solutions for time - dependent wave functions by virtue of their multiplicity .",
    "although the effectiveness of the multiple gaussian method with the variational principle has been shown to approximate time - dependent wave functions @xcite , its capability has not been shown in the context of time - dependent fokker - planck equations ( fpes ) .    after the gaussian wavepacket approximations in quantum mechanics , several studies employed a superposition of gaussian distributions for langevin equations @xcite .",

    "@xcite developed an approximation scheme based on superposed gaussian distributions , which calculated the mean and variance with a fixed weight .",

    "more - direct numerical schemes , such as a finite - element method @xcite and a finite - difference method @xcite , have also been studied . these approaches ,",

    "to investigate the effectiveness of vsga , we applied it to a quartic bistable system subject to white or colored noise .",
    "although a bistable system can describe switching dynamics and has many and varied applications to realistic problems @xcite , its nonlinearity makes the application of the simple mm difficult .",
    "we consider a system driven by a chaotic signal ( the rssler oscillator ) .",
    "when the signal is aperiodic , we can not use a fourier series expansion , as is often employed for periodic cases @xcite , and hence many studies have resorted to using direct monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",

    "the vsga introduced in section  [ sec : methods ] can be used to obtain several time - dependent solutions of fpes .",
    "we have shown that our approach can provide very accurate approximations by the superposition of multiple gaussian distributions for one- and two - dimensional driven systems .",
    "we have modeled the mean , variance , and weight as time - dependent parameters . however , as inclusion of the covariance terms [ @xmath169 in eq .   significantly increases the number of parameters ,",
    "it is one possible approach to approximate the covariance as a constant in order to reduce the computational cost .",
    "this approach has been considered in the gaussian wavepacket approximation in quantum mechanics @xcite and is referred to as a _ frozen _",
    "method ( the time - dependent covariance model is called a _ thawed _",
    "method ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : equantity_each_gaussian ] , the temporal variation of the standard deviation is around @xmath146 which is smaller than that of the mean .",
    "therefore , if we can first specify the standard deviation of each gaussian basis , we may ignore the time evolution of the variance .",
    "this frozen approximation could dramatically reduce the number of parameters in the vsga where the parameter size @xmath42 is @xmath182 being linear with respect to the dimension @xmath3 and its order of @xmath3 is smaller than that given by eq .  .",
    "although the effectiveness of the vsga was demonstrated by our numerical results , it has some disadvantages . because multiple gaussian distributions are not orthogonal",
    ", the vsga can not calculate solutions when more than two gaussian distributions coalesce . in theory",
    ", the accuracy of the vsga increases when more basis functions are used ( cf .",
    "[ fig : distance_as_nb ] ) .",
    "however , due to their nonorthogonality , an excessively large number of bases prevents the calculation of the time evolution of the parameters .",
    "also it becomes more difficult to find valid initial values of daes for the large @xmath66 cases .",
    "indeed , for the one - dimensional case , the vsga could not calculate the time evolution with @xmath116 for @xmath158 . for such cases",
    ", we should reduce @xmath66 in order to enable the calculations .",
    "similarly , for the two - dimensional case , colored noise with a larger time correlation tends to yield steeper peaks , which makes the application of the vsga difficult with large @xmath66 .",
    "because peaks of pdfs are represented by a few gaussian bases in vsga , the required number of bases @xmath66 can be estimated by the number of stable points of the system . when there is no input signal",
    ", we can know the number of stable points from a deterministic equation by solving @xmath183 [ a time - independent drift in eq .   and evaluating eigenvalues of the jacobian matrix around the solutions .",
    "if the input signal is weak , it is expected that a driven case has the same number of stable points as the no input case .",
    "still the vsga can provide a computationally efficient way to calculate the time - dependent dynamics of fpes .",
    "chaotically driven stochastic systems have often been solved by mc simulations . as shown in section  [ sec : results ] , the vsga successfully and very accurately calculated many of the quantities for the system without relying on stochastic approaches .",
    "we applied the vsga to a quartic bistable potential , where the moments of the gaussian can be calculated in closed form .",
    "the integral in eq .   can be computed analytically if the potentials are represented by polynomials . however , for general nonlinear models , the moment can not necessarily be represented in closed form . in such situations , we may approximate the drift term @xmath184 by the taylor expansion : @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the center of the gaussian distribution in the integrand . when using the linear approximation , obtained results become unreliable",
    "when the nonlinearity of a system is strong and/or the variance of basis is large . as for the quartic bistable case , the linear approximation can yield accurate solutions when the noise intensity is sufficiently weak ( i.e. the variance of basis is small ) .",
    "to summarize , we have proposed the vsga for the time - dependent solution for langevin equations by using the variational principle for superposition of multiple gaussian distributions . because we have shown the effectiveness of the vsga in strongly nonlinear systems ,",
    "the vsga is expected to be used for many real - world problems .",
    "applications of the vsga to other problems , such as to stochastic models of gene expression @xcite , are left to our future study .",
    "the @xmath3-dimensional multivariate gaussian distribution is generally given by the following representation : @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the mean vector ( column vector ) and @xmath189 is the covariance matrix ( positive definite ) . in eq .",
    ", @xmath190 denotes the determinant of @xmath189 .",
    "the mixture of multivariate gaussian distributions is given by @xmath191 where @xmath139 is the weight ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "this conventional representation and eq .   are related in the following way : @xmath193 according to eq .",
    ", @xmath169 is positive definite since it is the inverse of a positive definite matrix ( @xmath194 is positive definite ) .",
    "the inverse transform of eqs .  ",
    "is @xmath195 in eqs .  ",
    ", we used the fact that @xmath169 is symmetric .",
    "one of the difficulties in our approach is to find valid initial values for the daes . unlike conventional ( explicit ) ordinary differential equations",
    ", daes must satisfy an equality condition , and some parameters should be determined numerically by that equality ( in our implementation , this was done automatically by _ mathematica _ 10 ) .",
    "we found that calculating the equality is difficult in some cases . for larger noise intensities @xmath83 ( for both the white- and colored - noise cases ) and for smaller correlation times @xmath162 ( for the colored - noise case )",
    ", it is relatively easy to find valid initial values for the dae .",
    "therefore , when finding initial values when @xmath83 is smaller , we first find valid initial values with @xmath104 ( large @xmath83 value ) and then iterate the calculations , adopting the converged stationary values of the preceding @xmath83 values as the initial values used to find the next @xmath83 value .",
    "it is also possible to adjust the system by making @xmath83 ( or @xmath162 ) a time - dependent parameter and assuming that @xmath83 ( @xmath162 ) decreases ( increases ) over time starting from large @xmath83 ( small @xmath162 ) value .",
