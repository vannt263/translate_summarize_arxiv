    "the exploration of the nature and the extent of correlations generated by the many - body dynamics has both fundamental and practical applications .",
    "one of the fundamental issues in the investigation of many - body dynamics is finding an optimal set of coordinates @xcite .",
    "this problem is solved in classical mechanics by introducing partition of a complex system into smaller subsystems , i.e. , introducing of degrees of freedom .",
    "description of the composite system is furnished by local descriptions of the subsystems .",
    "the adequacy of a particular partition depends heavily on the nature and the extent of the correlations between the local degrees of freedom .",
    "the role played by correlations in classical and quantum mechanics is substantially different .",
    "this is due to the presence of the quantum correlations , or entanglement , in a composite quantum state , having no analog in the classical world @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical correlations @xcite , extensive entanglement makes the partition of a quantum system meaningless , since local measurements do not provide information on the state of an entangled system @xcite .    the problem of the optimal partition is deeply connected to the foundation of many - body dynamical simulations . the complete description of system composed of fully correlated subsystems should grow exponentially with the number of subsystems involved .",
    "a possibility of representing a state of a complex system as a mixture of independently evolving uncorrelated states ( trajectories ) solves in principle the problem of many - body simulations , permitting to sample single trajectories for simulation and averaging the result subsequently @xcite .",
    "this possibility is inherent in classical mechanics but is nongeneric in quantum case , due to the fact that typical interaction of quantum system generates entanglement .",
    "if the growth of total ( i.e. quantum and classical ) correlations becomes restricted , the quantum dynamics can be efficiently simulated @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is still an open question whether restrictions on quantum correlations alone are sufficient to provide for efficient simulations @xcite .    addressing the problem of dynamical generation of correlations it is necessary to distinguish between the unitary evolution of an isolated system and the open evolution of a system coupled to an environment .",
    "while a given unitary evolution can generate extensive entanglement , coupling the system to an environment is generally expected to restrict entanglement generation .",
    "this expectation originates in the general philosophy , seeing in environmental - induced decoherence @xcite the universal route of quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "it is consistent with some established results on open - systems entanglement dynamics .",
    "evolution of quantum correlations under the influence of environment was investigated both in the context of quantum to classical transition @xcite and in the context of quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "most studies have been concerned with dynamics of entanglement between _ noninteracting _ systems coupled to a bath .",
    "it was found that coupling to common environment is able to entangle noninteracting systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "coupling to certain local environments leads to total disentanglement of the systems in finite time @xcite .",
    "the rates of disentanglement were calculated in bi- and multipartite systems of noninteracting qubits @xcite and quidits @xcite , locally coupled to various environments . a number of studies addressed dynamical generation of correlations between _ interacting _ subsystems in the presence of the environment .",
    "production of entanglement between qubits , modeling a system of ions , coupled to environment through their center of mass motion in ion - traps , was investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was found that the coupling to environment diminishes the maximally achievable entanglement , with the corresponding entanglement loss increasing with the number of ions .",
    "@xcite explored dynamics of entanglement in quantum heisenberg xy chain , immersed in a global purely dephasing bath .",
    "the robustness of entanglement against the dephasing was related to the number of spin in the chain .",
    "coupling of interacting subsystems to local environments was considered in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the generation and transfer of entanglement in harmonic chains .",
    "the creation of entanglement by suddenly switching on the interaction in the chain was found robust against the decoherence induced by coupling of the oscillators to local harmonic baths .",
    "the model of two harmonically coupled quantum brownian particles was treated in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was found that in the physically interesting range of parameters the interaction between the particles can not prevent their eventual disentanglement , induced by coupling to local baths .",
    "while the observed disentanglement of the noninteracting systems by coupling to local environments meets the common intuition about the quantum - to - classical transition , the picture of dynamics of entanglement in the presence of interaction is not so clear . searching for an efficient and a universal environment - induced mechanism of restricting the extent of the generated entanglement",
    ", it seems necessary to focus on the following aspects of the dynamics of correlations .",
    "first , the scaling of the generated correlations with the effective hilbert space dimension of the interacting subsystems must be considered .",
    "this is in contrast to the context of the quantum information processing where the object of interest is usually the scaling of entanglement with the number of degrees of freedom ( qubits ) .",
    "the expectation is that the environment - induced restriction on the generation of entanglement becomes most significant in the range of the large quantum numbers of the system , which is commonly associated with the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "in fact , extensive entanglement in the large hilbert space dimension seems impossible without creating the `` cat - state '' superpositions , which are expected to be destroyed by the decoherence .",
    "second , the dynamics of correlations must be followed on the short , interaction time scales .",
    "it is possible that the long - time dynamics of an open composite system , approaching equilibrium , is disentangled , but the entanglement generated on the interaction time scales is so large that the partition of the system has no meaning .",
    "moreover , since a _",
    "common _ environment will generically entangle noninteracting systems , coupling to _ local _",
    "environments seems necessary to provide for a generic route to a disentangled dynamics .",
    "the present study focuses on the investigation of environment - induced constraints on the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations in the open bipartite composite system .",
    "the system consists of two nonlinearly interacting harmonic oscillators , coupled to local purely dephasing baths .",
    "the distinction between the dephasing and pure dephasing has first appeared in the context of nmr @xcite .",
    "pure dephasing corresponds to loss of coherence in the energy representation .",
    "the two prototypes of underlying stochastic processes leading to dephasing are the gaussian and the poissonian processes @xcite .",
    "r. kubo based his line - shape theory @xcite on the gaussian model .",
    "the kubo s model is the cornerstone of the condensed - matter spectroscopy .",
    "recently exceptions to the gaussian paradigm have been found experimentally @xcite in ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy .",
    "the poissonian model was shown to describe the dynamics adequately .",
    "quantum poissonian stochastic models have first appeared in the gas collision theory .",
    "they are also employed in the condense phase physics .",
    "for example , the poissonian noise has been considered as a source of decoherence in quantum dots @xcite . due to the fundamental and the experimental relevance of the gaussian and the poissonian stochastic processes they were chosen as the source of the dephasing in the present study .",
    "the models aim to explore dynamics of correlations in a composite system of coupled multilevel subsystems at large effective hilbert space dimension .",
    "examples of such systems include multimode molecular vibrations @xcite , linear and nonlinear quantum optics @xcite and cold trapped atomic ions @xcite.the primary goal is to locate a generic mechanism by which the decoherence keeps an interacting composite system `` approximately disentangled '' all along the evolution .",

    "the number of non vanishing coefficients @xmath7 in the schmidt decomposition of a vector in a abstract tensor - product hilbert space is called the _ schmidt rank _ of the vector . to avoid confusion in the following presentation the term _ hs - schmidt rank _ ( or just _ hs rank _ for brevity )",
    "is adopted for the schmidt decomposition in the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) space of operators , while retaining the term schmidt rank for the schmidt decomposition in the corresponding hilbert ( pure ) state space .",

    "separable states are mixtures of uncorrelated states , which can be completely characterized by local measurements .",
    "therefore , partition of a composite system into parts has a strong physical meaning .",
    "such a partition is always possible for classical probability density distribution of a bipartite system @xcite .",

    "estimating the measure of mixed - state entanglement is a difficult conceptual and computational problem @xcite .",
    "one can look for decomposition of @xmath14 into a mixture of pure states that are least entangled on average .",
    "the average entanglement corresponding to such decomposition is a possible measure of the mixed state entanglements .",

    "the negativity of the state equals the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed state . by the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite the negativity vanishes in a separable state . on the other hand , vanishing of the negativity",
    "does not imply separability of the state in general @xcite .",
    "finite negativity is necessary and sufficient condition for the presence of entanglement in particular type of mixed states , the so called schmidt - correlated states @xcite . in this case",

    "it has been proved @xcite that for schmidt - correlated states @xmath29 i.e. , the negativity equals half the sum of absolute values of the off - diagonal elements of the density operator , written in a @xmath30 local tensor product basis .",
    "it follows that the negativity of entangled schmidt - correlated states is finite @xcite .",
    "the negativity can be related to the structure of the density operator .",

    "the sum of the absolute values of the off - diagonal elements can be estimated as follows : @xmath33 where the first inequality follows from the positivity of the density operator and the second is the inequality of geometric and arithmetic means .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 in the state ( [ eq : almsep2 ] ) .",
    "since the negativity of maximally entangled state ( corresponding to @xmath35 in eq.([eq : almsep1 ] ) ) equals @xmath36 , as follows from eq.([eq : bellman ] ) , the negativity of quasi diagonal density matrices is negligible compared to the maximally entangled state . it should be noted that the form ( [ eq : almsep2 ] ) with @xmath32 of the density matrix does not constrain the magnitude of the classical correlations present in the state .",
    "for example , a strictly diagonal matrix @xmath37 corresponds to a maximally ( classically ) correlated separable state .",
    "schmidt correlated states appear naturally in a composite bipartite dynamics admitting particular conservations laws @xcite .",
    "the models of open - system dynamics considered in the following sections belong to that class . as a consequence",
    ", the presence and extent of entanglement in evolving composite systems can be related to the structure of the density matrix , which can be inferred on the basis of relatively general scaling considerations .",

    "the open evolution of noninteracting subsystems ( @xmath47 ) is considered first . in this case",
    "a local dephasing evolution of each separate system takes place : @xmath48    in many models of open evolution @xcite it is found that the evolving state undergoes decoherence , characterized by the decay of the off - diagonal elements of the density operator in particular basis of the _ robust states_. ideal robust states retain their purity notwithstanding the interaction with environment .",
    "examples of such models include interaction with a purely dephasing environment , singling out energy states as the robust basis , quantum brownian motion and damped harmonic oscillator at zero temperature @xmath49 , which select the robust basis of coherent states . while the robust states basis is determined by the type of the bath and the system hamiltonian , the time scales of the decoherence generally depend on the initial state as well .",
    "let us assume that the local superoperators @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eq.([generallocal ] ) single out local robust states bases @xmath27 and @xmath28 . a composite noninteracting system evolving according to eq.([generallocal ] ) from an arbitrary initial state is expected to decohere in the tensor product basis : @xmath30 .",
    "that means that an arbitrary initial state density matrix will eventually diagonalize in this basis .",
    "switching on the interaction between subsystems causes a competition between entanglement generation and decoherence induced by the local baths . for sufficiently weak interaction viewing the evolving density operator in the unperturbed tensor product basis @xmath30 of local robust states",
    "is a good starting point .",
    "if the interaction perturbs only slightly the evolution of an off - diagonal matrix element , it will decay on an almost unperturbed decoherence time scale .    to proceed with a more quantitative argument",
    "the concept of the effective hilbert space @xmath52 is helpful . since the energy of the evolving system is finite , the evolution can be effectively restricted to a hilbert space with finite dimension .",

    "when @xmath58 , the interaction timescale is slow compared to the shortest decoherence time scale . as a consequence , the evolution of certain matrix elements is only slightly perturbed by the interaction . in that case",
    "the perturbed dynamics of the matrix element will follow essentially the course of the decoherence .",
    "therefore , a rough distinction can be made between the region of the density matrix dominated by the decoherence and the region dominated by the interaction .",
    "the border between the two regions is defined by the condition @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the unperturbed decoherence time scale of a matrix element @xmath61 , @xmath62 .    in case that the decoherence - dominated regions of the density matrix are not populated initially , they will stay unpopulated in the course of the perturbed evolution .",

    "this possibility appeals to one who believes in the environmental - induced decoherence as a universal instrument of quantum to classical transition .",
    "an interesting question is the fate of the classical correlations in this scenario .",
    "while decoherence - dominated dynamics can turn extensively entangled initial state into extensively classically correlated state , it is not clear that decoherence - dominated dynamics can generate extensive classical correlations when quantum entanglement is negligible all along the evolution .",
    "negligible total correlations seem nongeneric and do not correspond to the intuitive picture of a `` really interacting '' system .",

    "estimation of bounds on negativity in the evolving state was based on analysis of the structure of the density matrix in particular local robust states bases . relating the negativity to the structure of the density operator was facilitated by the observation that the evolving states are schmidt - correlated due to particular conservation laws observed by the interactions .",

    "these findings can be informally interpreted as a trade - off between the classical and quantum correlations : since the total correlations are ( relatively ) unaffected by the environment , restriction on the entanglement generation must be `` compensated '' by the growth of the classical correlations .    considering the restriction on the generation of entanglement",
    ", a natural question arises : is the observed restriction substantial , i.e. is the given partition of the composite system meaningful ? when can a composite systems be regarded as _ approximately disentangled _ ?",
    "the answer depends on the definition of the relevant scale of a measure of entanglement in the evolving system .",
    "is the scale unity or some power of the effective hilbert space dimension or neither ?",
    "one possibility is to compare the entanglement , generated in the open evolution to the entanglement , generated in the corresponding unitary evolution .",
    "numerical evidence obtained in the present study shows that entanglement is always relatively restricted in the open system dynamics . in some cases , such as the gaussian pure dephasing",
    ", it can even be negligible in asymptotically large hilbert space dimensions .",
    "this comparison elucidates the role of the decoherence in constraining the generation of the quantum correlations .",

    "the results of the present study show that in some models , such as the gaussian pure dephasing and weakly nonlinear or band - limited interactions , coupling to local environments does the job , i.e. it restricts the generated entanglement to bounds , negligible compared to the maximal compatible entanglement .",
    "still , in all cases apart from a band - limited type of the interaction , entanglement , generated on the interaction time scale in the open system evolution , grows without bounds with the effective hilbert space dimension . as a consequence ,",
