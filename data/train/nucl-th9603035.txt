    "nuclear structure has been discussed mostly in the context of the liquid drop and shell models .",
    "these models have been extremely useful in explaining many observed nuclear properties .",
    "however , they are based on macroscopic concepts , and do not address the simplest nuclei , hydrogen and helium .",
    "furthermore , recent @xmath22 experiments  @xcite have indicated that in heavier near - closed - shell nuclei , less than @xmath23 of the nucleons are in the single - particle orbitals that would be fully occupied in the simple shell model .    to obtain a more microscopic description of nuclear structure",
    ", we may regard the nucleus as a collection of interacting nucleons described by the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath24 the interactions @xmath25 and @xmath26 are not exactly known , but @xmath25 is well constrained by the available scattering data , and binding energies and theoretical considerations place important constraints on @xmath26 .",
    "the structure of the ground - state wave function @xmath27 at small interparticle distances is influenced by the repulsive core and tensor parts of @xmath25 .",
    "most realistic models of @xmath25 contain these components and , for example , the reid  @xcite , paris  @xcite , urbana  @xcite and new argonne @xmath28  @xcite models seem to predict similar structures .",
    "the three - nucleon interaction @xmath26 is much weaker than the @xmath25 . due to a large cancellation between kinetic and two - body interaction energies",
    ", it has a significant effect on nuclear binding energies  @xcite but its effect on the structure of @xmath27 is much less than that of the better known @xmath25 .    due to the strong spin - isospin dependence of @xmath25 and @xmath26 it is difficult to solve the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) .",
    "only recently it has been possible to obtain accurate solutions for @xmath29 nuclei  @xcite with the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method .",
    "accurate variational wave functions @xmath30 , which contain less than @xmath31 admixture of excited states are known for @xmath32 = 3 and 4 nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the available @xmath30 for @xmath6li  @xcite and @xmath7o  @xcite are certainly not as accurate as those for @xmath32 = 3 and 4 , nevertheless they presumably contain most of the important structure of the @xmath27 .    in this paper",
    "we examine the short - range structure of @xmath4h , @xmath5he , @xmath6li and @xmath7o by calculating the two - nucleon density distributions in states with isospin @xmath33 , spin @xmath1 , and spin projection @xmath2 . since the deuteron has only two nucleons , its one- and two - body density distributions are trivially related .",
    "variational wave functions @xmath30 and monte carlo methods are used for @xmath34 .",
    "the two - nucleon distributions in the @xmath20 states have a strong dependence on the spin projection @xmath2 .",
    "the equidensity surfaces , spanning the top three quarters of the density range in @xmath2=0 states , have toroidal shape .",
    "these tori are produced by the joint action of the repulsive core and tensor interactions .",
    "in contrast the equidensity shapes in the @xmath2=@xmath31 have dumbbell shapes , which have been studied earlier in the deuteron  @xcite .",
    "a brief description of the two - nucleon interaction in @xmath20 states is given in section ii , and the density distribution of the deuteron is discussed in detail in section iii , where we show that the dumbbell - shaped distributions in @xmath2=@xmath31 states are produced by rotating tori .",
    "commonly used models of @xmath25 predict that the maximum density torus has a diameter of @xmath171 fm , and the half - maximum density torus has a thickness of @xmath170.9 fm . in section iii",
    "we relate these dimensions of the toroidal distribution to the observed electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron .",
    "the structures are rather dense ; current models predict the maximum one - body density of the torus inside the deuteron to be @xmath35 @xmath36 , i.e. , approximately twice nuclear matter density .",
    "the two - nucleon @xmath20 , @xmath37 density distributions in @xmath5he , @xmath6li and @xmath7o are compared with those of the deuteron in section iv .",
    "the distributions for @xmath8 fm differ only by a single scale factor .",
    "they indicate that in the @xmath0 state , the tensor correlations have near maximal strength for @xmath8 fm in all these nuclei .",
    "the scale factor is identified as the levinger - bethe quasi - deuteron number , and its value is compared to the ratios of total photon ( @xmath38 = 80 to 120 mev ) and pion ( @xmath39115 mev ) absorption cross sections .    in order to study the nature of many - body structures induced by these compact two - body structures we study",
    "the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 overlaps with the @xmath30 of @xmath14he , @xmath15he and @xmath16li in section v. these depend strongly on the spin projection @xmath40 of the deuteron and indicate the presence of anisotropic structures in all these nuclei .",
    "experiments to probe these structures are suggested .",
    "pair distribution functions in other @xmath41 states are discussed in section vi .",
    "those in @xmath42 , @xmath43 states are anisotropic as expected from the pion - exchange tensor force .",
    "we also find that the number of @xmath44 pairs in a nucleus is reduced due to many - body effects involving the strong @xmath45 tensor correlations .",
    "this reduction gives a significant contribution to the saturation of nuclear binding energies .",
    "the skyrme field theory  @xcite , related to qcd in the limit of large number of colors @xmath46 , has predicted toroidal shapes for the deuteron  @xcite in the classical limit .",
    "density distributions of the ground states with 3 to 6 baryons have also been calculated  @xcite in this limit . in the last section , vii ,",
    "we summarize our results , obtained with conventional nuclear many - body theory , and indicate their relation to those of the skyrme field theory in the classical limit , and of the constituent quark model .",
    "nuclear forces are not yet quantitatively understood from qcd . however",
    ", many realistic models have been constructed by fitting the available two - nucleon scattering data .",
    "the shape of the short - range structures in the @xmath20 state appears to be relatively model - independent .",
    "the interaction @xmath47 in the @xmath20 state in reid , urbana and argonne models can be expressed as @xmath48 while a @xmath49 operator is used instead of @xmath50 in the paris potential .",
    "the structures are formed mostly by the static part of the interaction : @xmath51 it is instructive to study the expectation values of @xmath52 in eigenstates of the position operator @xmath53 with spin projections @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=@xmath31 .",
    "these depend upon @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the polar angle of @xmath53 with respect to the spin - quantization axis @xmath56 , and are given by @xmath57 the @xmath2=0 expectation value of @xmath52 has the largest variation with @xmath55 as illustrated in fig .",

    "is dominated by the one - pion - exchange potential , while at smaller @xmath54 it has a significant model dependence .",
    "much of this model dependence is cancelled by the differences in the momentum - dependent terms in the models .",
    "in particular , the deuteron wave functions calculated from these potentials have much smaller model dependence .",
    "these are commonly written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the @xmath1- and @xmath13-state radial wave functions and @xmath66 are the spin - angle functions .",

    "we will not consider the possibility of such an additional structure in this work .",
