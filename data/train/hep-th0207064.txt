    "recently , the moduli space of bps domain walls has been discussed by tong @xcite and , following manton s method , the low energy dynamics of solitons has been studied by townsend and portugues @xcite in variations of the wess - zumino model .    in this paper",
    "we shall study the low energy dynamics of bps kinks living in a topological sector of a super - symmetric ( 1 + 1)-dimensional system proposed by bazeia and co - workers in @xcite . in @xcite shifman and voloshin",
    "have shown that the ( 1 + 1)d system comes from the dimensional reduction of a generalized wess - zumino model with two chiral super - fields ; in this latter case , the kink solutions appear as bps domain walls .    from a one - dimensional perspective",
    ", the system encompasses several topological sectors and shifman and voloshin in @xcite discovered that there exists a degenerate family of bps domain walls in a distinguished sector . in @xcite",
    ", three of us found that for some critical values of the coupling parameter there exist more degenerate kink families in other topological sectors , although the new walls are generically non - bps .",
    "each bps domain wall , however , seems to be made from two basic walls , which belong to other topological sectors .",
    "this interesting structure has been explored by sakai and sugisaka , who found in @xcite an intriguing bound - state of wall / anti - wall pairs .",
    "the aim of this work is to describe how the basic kinks move in the space of bps topological kinks . to achieve this goal",
    "we shall apply manton s method and we shall thus extend the applicability of the adiabatic principle to one - dimensional topological defects .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ",
    "2 we briefly summarize the general framework of ( 1 + 1)d super - symmetric field theory . section  3 is devoted to describing the moduli space of bps super - kink solutions . in section",
    " 4 we unveil the metric inherited from the adiabatic kink motion in the space of kink solutions , determine the geodesic orbits , and describe the low speed motion of bps kinks . finally , in section ",
    "5 we interpret these results from the point of view of moving walls .",

    "note that there is no anomaly in the central charge if the super - potential is harmonic , the condition for the existence of @xmath28 super - symmetry .",
    "the usual definition of bps states in this system , @xcite , is derived from ( [ eq : algs ] ) : @xmath29 as the requirement of minimal energy in each super - selection sector . to find these states a variational method , using the coherent states @xmath30 as trial states ,",

    "thus , the bps states are the coherent states for which the scalar field configurations correspond to the flow lines of @xmath34 , whereas the corresponding @xmath35 eigen - spinor @xmath36 configurations are zero . moreover , super - symmetry forces the surviving ( non - null ) spinor configurations to satisfy the equation : @xmath37",

    "in our framework , the adiabatic principle is equivalent to restricting time - evolution to the sub - space of bps kink states .",

    "@xmath139 , however , is also real for @xmath140 because the denominator becomes purely imaginary in this regime , see figure 6 .",
    "there is an important difference with the low energy dynamics of other topological defects . in this case",
    "the moduli space @xmath141 is an orbifold : the orbit of every point in the tk1 line @xmath142 by the action of the @xmath132-group is a single point whereas any other point in @xmath46 is not invariant under the @xmath133 reflection .",
    "therefore , geodesic motion in @xmath78 would lead to non - smooth dynamics at the tk1 line . fortunately",
    ", the generic orbit is a two - element set and one can safely pursue the analysis of geodesic motion in @xmath46 .",
    "the geodesics of a metric in the kink space @xmath46 of the form : @xmath143 are easily found ( at least implicitly ) .",
    "writing the metric in terms of a new variable , @xmath144 , we have : @xmath145 and the geodesic curves are straight lines in the @xmath146 plane . if @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , are integration constants , the geodesics are : @xmath151 in terms of the new integration constants , @xmath152 , we can also represent the geodesic paths by writing @xmath153 as a function of @xmath51 : @xmath154 we immediately identify a simple kind of geodesic motion : taking @xmath155 in ( [ eq : orbits ] ) , orbits with @xmath156 are found .",
    "this motion corresponds to free displacement of the kink center of mass , for all types of solitary wave , without changing the shape of the kink profile , see figure 7 .    in a search for the more general geodesic motion ,",
    "the problem is to find the explicit form of @xmath157 . because performing this integration explicitly is out of reach by analytical means , we propose two alternative ways for describing the geodesic motion of bps kinks .      in figure 8(a ) a mathematica numerical plot of several geodesic orbits ( [ eq : orbits ] ) is shown .",
    "@xmath158 has been set to 3 , 2 and 1 , whereas the freedom in @xmath159 has been fixed by setting the value of @xmath160 -near the tk1 point in the space @xmath46- at the instant @xmath161 .",
    "the features common to these generic geodesics are as follows : the starting point at @xmath162 is the point in @xmath163 that corresponds to the @xmath164 limit of ( [ eq : mei ] ) .",
    "coming from very far apart , the two basic lumps begin to approach each other when @xmath117 decreases .",
    "this approach occurs simultaneously to a global displacement from @xmath165 of the center of mass : @xmath51 increases .",
    "the two kinks merge in a single tk2e@xmath166 lump at the point @xmath167 in the space @xmath46 , and then move together , becoming higher and thinner until they become the tk1 kink when @xmath52 . from this point the composite lump moves towards the @xmath168 kinks , becoming shorter and thicker until the critical value @xmath169 is reached , where a meiosis of a tk2e@xmath170 kink takes place , giving back rise to two separate lumps .",
    "the geodesic evolution is completed through the increasing separation of the two lumps , @xmath117 increasing , and the center of mass motion , @xmath51 increasing , asymptotically running towards the @xmath171 limit of the ( [ eq : mei ] ) configuration",
    ".    a closer look at the geodesic orbits near the tk1 point depicted in figure 8(b ) shows us that the bigger @xmath158 the shorter the time that the two lumps remain aggregated . at the @xmath172 limit",
    ", the geodesic curve becomes a vertical straight line in the space @xmath46 and there is no motion of the center of mass at all .",
    "different values of @xmath159 give different geodesic orbits by setting the kink point crossed at the instant @xmath161 .",
    "in summ , a generic orbit describes the following low energy dynamics : the motion starts from two infinitely separated @xmath173 $ ] kinks ( [ eq : tkab ] ) living in the topological sectors in which any configuration asymptotically connects the vacuum @xmath174 with the vacuum @xmath175 , and , @xmath176 with @xmath177 .",

    "the whole picture is synthesized in figure 9 .",

    ", time runs from left to right and the spatial coordinate @xmath95 grows from bottom to top .",
    "it is possible and indeed appropriate to find analytically the geodesics near the special points @xmath52 , @xmath107 and @xmath185 in @xmath46 .",
    "close to the tk1 point in @xmath46 , the metric can be obtained approximately from the series expansion of @xmath139 around @xmath52 : @xmath187 the geodesic orbits are given in this region by : @xmath188 therefore , equation ( [ eq : tk1v ] ) analytically describes how the tk1 kink is reached from kink configurations in its neighbourhood and vice - versa .",
    "note that this statement is tantamount to saying that ( [ eq : tk1v ] ) determines how the two basic kinks become completely aggregated on the tk1 kink , @xmath189 , and how they start to split , @xmath190 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath139 around the @xmath107 points ; @xmath192 leads to the geodesic asymptotic behaviour @xmath193 which shows how the two @xmath194 $ ] kinks ( [ eq : tkab ] ) are reached exponentially fast in @xmath51 , or , how fast the two @xmath195 $ ] lumps start to approach each other .",
    "there is a subtlety : @xmath196 and the metric ceases to be a rank - two tensor at these limits .",
    "dynamically this breakdown of the geometrical meaning is due to the fact that by taking the @xmath119 limit we go out of @xmath46 because the separation between the two basic kinks is infinite .",
    "there are still two other special points corresponding to the two - component topological tk2e@xmath126 kinks where the melting into a single lump -@xmath167- or the splitting into two lumps -@xmath169- take place . despite appearances ,",
    "the metric at @xmath198 is regular and the series expansion of @xmath139 in the vicinity of these points reads : @xmath199 therefore , the geodesic equations @xmath200 analytically rule the low energy process of two - lump fusion into tk2e@xmath166 / tk2e@xmath170 fission into two lumps in the vicinity of the tk2e@xmath126 kink points of the @xmath46 space .",
