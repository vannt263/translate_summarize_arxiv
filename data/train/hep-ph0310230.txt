    "as it is well known , regge theory and dglap evolution both provide very good descriptions of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) . one may therefore try to see if these two approaches are consistent@xcite . however , this question is far from evident due to the essential singularity generated by dglap evolution .",
    "moreover , we have shown in @xcite that , as required by regge theory , it is possible to describe all processes using the same singularity structure in complex @xmath1-plane .",
    "we shall show that this universal behaviour can be extended to parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , i.e. that we can choose an initial condition for dglap evolution with a common singularity structure . in this picture ,",
    "@xmath2 is describes by regge theory for @xmath3 and by dglap equation for larger scales .",
    "finally , one has seen that , using a triple - pole pomeron , one can extend regge theory to high values of @xmath0 , where we expect perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) to apply . in other words ,",
    "the high-@xmath0 behaviour of the regge couplings must be predicted by dglap evolution .",
    "we shall see in section [ sec : resid ] that it is the case for the triple - pole pomeron model .",
    "structure function with @xmath4 gev@xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath0 values ( in gev@xmath5 ) are indicated for each curves . ]",
    "if we only want to reproduce @xmath7 , we only need two quark distributions ( @xmath8 ) : @xmath9 evolving alone and @xmath10 coupled with the gluon distribution @xmath11 . using these definitions , the proton structure function becomes @xmath12 .",
    "if we introduce a scale @xmath13 where dglap evolution breaks down , parton distributions will be described by a triple pole term and an @xmath14-reggeon term for @xmath15 while an essential singularity arising from dglap evolution will be present at larger scales .",
    "since regge theory does not extend up to @xmath16 , we shall use grv parton distribution functions for @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the pomeron contribution to @xmath18 must vanish because the pomeron is insentive to quark flavours and we shall assume that the reggeon , being mainly constituted of quarks , is not coupled to gluons .",
    "this leads to the following initial condition for dglap evolution ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 in these expressions , the parameters in @xmath21 are constrained by the regge fit of @xcite and , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed by continuity with grv at @xmath24 .",
    "we are thus left with two parameters : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we can adjust these parameters by fitting @xmath2 data from hera , bcdms , e665 and nmc within the domain @xmath27    one can show that for @xmath28 gev@xmath5 and @xmath29 , the fit gives a @xmath30 smaller than 1.01 .",
    "we have presented in fig.[fig : init5 ] the result for @xmath4 gev@xmath5 and @xmath6 , producing a @xmath30 of 0.985 .",
    "finally , one can show that the resulting gluon distribution is of the same order of magnitude as in the standard pdf sets .",
    "structure function using the form factors extracted from our model and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath0 values ( in gev@xmath5 ) are indicated for each curve . ]",
    "we know that the triple - pole pomeron model can be extended to high @xmath0 . in this case , the dglap evolution equation must be able to predict the residues at high @xmath0 .",
    "in such a case , due to the essential singularity generated by dglap evolution , we may only consider the dglap equation as a numerical approximation . in order to find the residues we may therefore adopt the following strategy :    1 .",
    "[ s21 ] choose an initial scale @xmath13 , 2 .",
    "[ s22 ] choose a value for the parameters in the initial distribution , 3 .",
    "[ s23 ] compute the parton distributions for @xmath32 using forward dglap evolution and for @xmath33 using backward dglap evolution , 4 .",
    "[ s24 ] repeat [ s22 ] and [ s23 ] until the value of the parameters reproducing the @xmath2 data for @xmath34 and @xmath35 is found .",
    "this gives the residues at the scale @xmath13 and steps [ s21 ] to [ s24 ] are repeated in order to obtain the residues at all @xmath0 values .    .",
    "@xmath2 is described by a triple pole if @xmath36 and by an essential singularity otherwise . ]        as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : form5 ] , the form factors found by this method reproduce @xmath2 successfully ( for @xmath37 gev@xmath5 and @xmath31 , @xmath38 for 560 points ) .    finally , we can look at the pdf obtained from this model . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf ] , the singlet quark distribution nearly does not depend on @xmath13 , which proves that the dglap equation constitutes a good numerical approximation to the triple - pole pomeron . for the gluon distribution , we see from fig . [ fig : pdfg ] that things are different . however , all these gluon distributions give acceptable @xmath2 predictions and differences in the gluon distribution between different @xmath13 must therefore be considered as uncertainties .",
    "firstly , we have seen that the regge fit in @xcite can be successfully extended to high values of @xmath0 using dglap evolution . in this method ,",
    "quarks and gluons have a common singularity structure , as requested by regge theory .",
    "we have then shown that , assuming that regge theory extends to high values of @xmath0 , one can consider dglap evolution as a numerical approximation and use it to extract the residues of the triple - pole pomeron at high @xmath0 .",
    "this method gives large uncertainties on the gluon distribution at low @xmath39 and low @xmath0 , which should be of prime importance for lhc physics .    in the future",
    ", we plan to see if we can extend this method to @xmath16 and to other regge models .",
    "one should also try to find some modifications of the dglap equation stabilizing a triple - pole in @xmath40 ."
