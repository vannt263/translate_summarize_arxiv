    "spectra ( fig .",

    "the background was estimated by stacking the bcd frames in a time series , masking sources , and fitting each pixel time series with a robust , low - order polynomial .",

    "however , these uncertainties appear to significantly underestimate the noise at observed wavelengths @xmath39 @xmath3 m ( rest frame 10.4 @xmath3 m ) . we attribute this to systematically deviant pixels that we were unable to identify and remove in this noisier wavelength range .",
    "feature fluxes measured in this wavelength range , such as those of [ s iv ] and the 11.3 @xmath3 m pah , should be interpreted with caution .",

    "such a small aperture is utilized to minimize contamination from nearby sources .",
    "a wavelength - independent flux calibration factor equal to the pixel solid angle ( @xmath41 sr / pixel ) was derived from the ratio of spice over cubism extractions of the spiderweb , in bcds where it was centered on the slit .",
    "we applied a correction for detector fringeing to the spiderweb spectrum , reducing @xmath42 oscillations in the observed 21 - 25 @xmath3 m region down to the 1% level .",
    "we used pahfit @xcite to obtain a least - squares fit to the continuum , emission lines , and pah features .",
    "the continuum was fit with the sum of blackbody spectra covering a range of dust temperatures .",
    "no extinction was included in the fits since it did not improve them .",
    "the emission lines were fit with unresolved gaussian line profiles . in the case of emission line blends ,",
    "the fluxes were summed to give the total flux of the blend , rather than report individual line fluxes .",
    "the pah features are fit by drude profiles , with rest wavelengths and widths fixed to values appropriate for star - forming low - redshift galaxies , but with relative intensities allowed to vary .",
    "while it is not clear a priori that the mean pah composition and feature shapes should be the same at high redshift , this provides a good fit for most features , except for the 8.6 @xmath3 m pah which appears to be shifted to shorter wavelength (  3 ) .",

    "however , the majority of the reported 11.23 @xmath3 m flux ( table 1 ) is likely contributed by the blue wing of the 11.33 @xmath3 m pah feature .",
    "we detect a number unresolved emission lines ( table 2 ) in the spectrum of the spiderweb , including [ ne vi ] , [ ar iii ] , [ s iv ] , and h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(3 ) .",
    "the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(4 ) line may be detected , but could be confused with substructure near the peak of the 7.7 @xmath3 m pah feature .",

    "the [ ne vi ] and h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(4 ) lines may be detected in hae 131 , however it is difficult to clearly distinguish these lines from possible substructure in the 7.7 @xmath3 m pah feature . while the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(3 )",
    "line is formally detected in hae 131 ( @xmath48 erg s@xmath2 @xmath49 ) , the peak of the line is not at the expected wavelength and may be contaminated by a noise spike , so we treat this as an upper limit .",
    "this line is clearly not detected in the continuum - subtracted h@xmath5 s(3 ) map ( fig .",
    "1 ) . hot dust continuum underlies the pah spectrum in hae 229 and weaker continuum emission is also visible at the short wavelength end of the hae 131 spectrum .    shifting the wavelength of the 8.6 @xmath3 m pah feature from the standard wavelength of 8.61 @xmath3 m to 8.57 @xmath3 m ( corresponding to a doppler shift of -1400 km s@xmath2 ) gave a better fit to the spectra of all three sources .",
    "we believe this indicates a shift in the intrinsic wavelength rather than a doppler shift because the emission lines and 7.7 and 11.3 @xmath3 m pah features have wavelengths consistent with the optical - nir emission line redshifts .",
    "the 8.6/7.7 micron pah ratios ( 0.21 - 0.38 ) seen in the three galaxies are somewhat greater than the range of pah ratios ( 0.11 - 0.21 ) seen in low - redshift star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "these differences in 8.6 @xmath3 m pah wavelength and pah ratios may indicate a difference in chemical composition or excitation of the pah molecules compared to low - redshift galaxies .",

    ", it is clear that most of the observed 24 @xmath3 m emission comes from the agn . the strong [ ne vi ] and [ s iv ] emission lines are additional indicators of a dominant agn contribution to the spectrum .",

    "the spiderweb is the brightest and most massive galaxy in the pks 1138 - 26 cluster , with a stellar mass of @xmath69 estimated from the sed of the central radio galaxy @xcite . adding the masses of the satellite galaxies estimated by @xcite increases the total stellar mass to @xmath70 within our @xmath71 ( 60 kpc ) radius spectral extraction aperture .",
    "the stellar mass doubling time scale at the pah - inferred star formation rate is therefore @xmath72 gyr .",
    "it appears that the spiderweb is in the process of building the bulk of its stellar mass at the observed epoch .",
    "the spiderweb may gain additional stellar mass ( a factor of 1.1 - 2.2 ) by accreting known satellite galaxies within a 150 kpc radius @xcite .",

    "we note that the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(2 ) , s(1 ) and s(0 ) lines may be similarly luminous , but are redshifted beyond the longest wavelength detectable with the irs .",
    "taken at face value , the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(3 ) and s(5 ) line fluxes fit by pahfit would indicate a temperature of @xmath73 k and an h@xmath5 mass of @xmath74 , assuming a single - temperature gas in equilibrium",
    ". however , the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(5 ) line is blended with [ ar ii ] .",

    "star formation rates estimated from the 7.7 @xmath3 m pah feature are a factor of 14 - 40 greater than estimates based on h@xmath0 , for hae 229 and hae 131 .",
    "this indicates that star formation is heavily obscured ( by @xmath133 mag ) at h@xmath0 and shorter wavelengths .",
    "this is in contrast to the spiderweb , where the pah - based and h@xmath0-based star formation rate estimates are comparable .",
    "this may suggest a different mode of more - extended , less obscured star formation in the spiderweb .",
    "this in turn may be consistent with the observed extended uv continuum emission @xcite if the uv extinction is more complicated than a simple obscuring screen .",
    "the extended mode of star - formation in the spiderweb could possibly be a result of negative feedback quenching star - formation in the nucleus , coupled with accretion of many satellite galaxies enhancing star formation in the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "high luminosity h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(3 ) emission from the spiderweb indicates a large mass of warm ( @xmath134 k ) molecular hydrogen , most likely heated by radio jet feedback from the agn , which may have already quenched nuclear star formation and may eventually quench quasar activity . in other words ,",
    "the high - star formation rates observed in high - redshift radio galaxies may be attributed to the accretion of gas and gas - rich satellite galaxies rather than nuclear star formation . at low redshift",
    ", the gas has been virialized and heated to @xmath135 k and the satellites have been incorporated into the central radio galaxy , such that there is no longer a steady gas supply for star formation .",
    "the remaining gas that is able to cool and make its way into the central kpc - scale disk is unable to form stars efficiently because it is either continuously or episodically heated by the radio jet .",
    "herschel fir - sub - mm photometry will determine the total ir luminosities of the galaxies in the pks 1138 - 26 protocluster , yielding more accurate star formation rates and dust mass estimates .",
    "herschel pacs spectroscopy may be sensitive enough to detect the h@xmath5 s(0 ) line and thereby measure the total mass of warm molecular gas in the spiderweb .",
    "the extreme luminosity of h@xmath5 rotational line emission in the spiderweb provides a strong incentive for launching a cooled , large aperture fir space telescope to detect these lines and use them to measure the impact of kinetic energy dissipation on molecular gas and star formation in even higher - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
