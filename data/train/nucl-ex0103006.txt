    "the pion - nucleon ( @xmath6n ) system at energies up to the first ( @xmath7 ) resonance continues to be an area of keen theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "this is due in large part to the intimate connection of low energy @xmath6n scattering to su(2 ) quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at low energies . by studying the low energy interactions of pions and nucleons ,",
    "one is able to probe the confinement scale structure of qcd ( via an effective theory , chiral perturbation theory , or chpt @xcite ) .",
    "two key areas of interest in low energy @xmath6n qcd centre on determinations of the precise values of the @xmath6n sigma term @xmath8 @xcite and the @xmath6nn coupling constant @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6n sigma term is fundamental to low energy qcd since it quantifies the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry due to the non - zero up and down quark masses .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath10 is _ the _ fundamental free parameter in chpt involving nucleons @xcite .",
    "it also appears in the well - known goldberger ",
    "treiman relation @xcite , which relates @xmath11 to the accurately known pion decay constant f@xmath12 , nucleon mass m , and axial - vector coupling constant , g@xmath13 .",
    "the analogous dashen - weinstein sum rule @xcite relates @xmath10 to coupling constants involving kaons , sigma and lambda baryons , and is closely connected to the quark condensate @xmath14 @xcite .    despite many years of investigation",
    ", there is still no broad consensus regarding the precise values of these important quantities . the  sigma term puzzle \" @xcite refers to the historical discrepancy between the phenomenologically determined value @xcite and the theoretical prediction @xcite , a discrepancy which could imply a large strange quark content of the proton .",
    "the puzzle has yet to be resolved @xcite .",
    "the value of the coupling constant @xmath10 has been controversial as well @xcite , with recent results split roughly into two groups : @xmath15 @xcite and 0.0755 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55% difference has significant implications for the aforementioned goldberger - treiman and dashen - weinstein relations , as well as for any model employing the @xmath6nn vertex ( e.g.  the bonn nn potential @xcite ) .",
    "a major reason for the difficulty in determining @xmath8 and @xmath10 arises from historical incompatibilities in the @xmath6n scattering database @xcite . as the determination of these parameters requires extrapolations of the scattering amplitudes to nonphysical kinematic points , an internally consistent database of precision data is crucial for reliable results .",
    "the most trustworthy analyses employ @xmath6n dispersion relations @xcite . since the @xmath16 @xmath6n partial wave amplitude in the delta resonance ( @xmath7 ) region dominates the dispersion relations used to obtain @xmath8 and @xmath10@xcite , it is crucial that the data in this energy region be reliable , mutually consistent , and of high quality .",
    "differential cross section data are of particular importance , yet to date only one comprehensive data set exists spanning the @xmath7 resonance , the work of bussey et al . @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the bussey data , and that of the companion total cross section work of carter et al .",
    "@xcite , are generally at variance with partial - wave analyses @xcite based on recent differential cross section data below 140 mev kinetic energy @xcite and above 267 mev @xcite , as well as with the other total cross section data of pedroni et al .",

    "the experiment was conducted on the m11 pion channel at triumf .",
    "data were obtained for both and elastic scattering at incident pion lab kinetic energies of @xmath0 = 141.15@xmath180.6 , 168.8@xmath180.7 , 193.2@xmath180.7 , 218.1@xmath180.8 , 240.9@xmath180.9 , and 267.3@xmath180.9 mev , and for @xmath3p , at 154.6@xmath180.6 mev as well .",
    "these energies were chosen to span the @xmath7 resonance , to overlap the highest energy used by brack et al . @xcite and the lowest of sadler et al .",
    "@xcite , and to coincide with those of the   analyzing power measurements of sevior et al .",
    "@xcite since the availability of both differential cross sections and analyzing powers at the same energies facilitates single - energy partial wave analyses .",
    "for all energies , two  arm coincidence data were obtained at middle and near - backward angles , while single - arm results ( with only the scattered @xmath3 detected ) were obtained at near ",
    "forward angles at 141.15 , 168.8 , and 218.1 mev .",
    "although the main goal of the experiment was to obtain statistically precise results , a study of the various sources of systematic uncertainty was also an important feature of this work .",
    "as pointed out by bugg @xcite , the six elements essential to a measurement of absolute differential cross sections are accurate knowledge of the : 1 ) beam intensity , 2 ) beam composition , 3 ) beam momentum , 4 ) target thickness , 5 ) solid angles , and 6 ) backgrounds . to ensure confidence in the results , the uncertainties claimed for the measurements should be based on the extent to which the values at each fixed kinematical point are independent of measured variations in the experimental conditions . in this way systematic uncertainties can be more accurately and reliably determined .    the general layout of the experiment is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : geantfig1 ] .",
    "a complete description of the detector elements is presented in the following sections .      for our experiment ,",
    "the pion beam originated at a beryllium target in the 140 @xmath19a primary proton line , bl1a , which yields a proton beam consisting of pulses @xmath53 - 4 ns wide occurring with a repetition rate of 23.06 mhz .",
    "after momentum selection in the m11 pion channel , the pions were brought to a doubly - achromatic double - focus at the target location .",
    "the incoming pion beam was detected by three beam - defining scintillators ( s1 , s2a , s2b ) operating in three - fold coincidence and placed upstream of the target .",
    "all consisted of 1.59 mm thick ne110 , wrapped by a single layer of 0.025 mm aluminum foil and 0.263 mm electrical tape .",
    "these counters were connected by short straight lucite light guides to photomultiplier tubes mounted on high - rate transistorized bases @xcite .",
    "alignment of the counters was carried out using an optical transit .",
    "the 25.4 mm wide by 102 mm high s1 counter was placed 903 mm upstream of the target centre , and 187 mm from the exit of the 200 mm diameter m11 beam pipe .",
    "the 12.7 mm wide by 44.5 mm high s2a and s2b counters were placed 410 and 405 mm , respectively , upstream of the target location .",
    "they were mounted so that the s2a phototube was above the scintillator and the s2b phototube below .",
    "this ensures that muons from pion decay downstream of s1 would not cause erroneous coincidences by producing @xmath20erenkov light in a s2 light guide that could be detected by the phototube , since such muons could hit only one of the two s2 light guides , and so such events were eliminated by the coincidence requirement .",
    "although the exact spot sizes depended on the settings of the rate - defining aperture ( jaws ) at the front end of the channel , the beam distributions at the target were typically 10 x 8 mm@xmath21 and 1@xmath2 x 4@xmath2 at half - maximum .",
    "two counter telescopes , each with two scintillators in coincidence , were used to monitor beam intensity relative to the beam counters .",
    "one set above the m11 beam pipe exit was used to detect muons from pion decay in the channel .",
    "the other set was mounted at beam height in the experimental area and oriented to view particles back - scattered from the s2a , b counters .    to determine the fraction of beam bursts containing only one pion ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : multpion ] ) , it was necessary to know the full beam rate on target , which was somewhat larger than the rate measured by the beam counters . for this purpose , a 201 x 201 x 6.35 mm@xmath22 veto paddle",
    "was placed 1230 mm downstream of the target position .",
    "this counter intercepted @xmath2395% of the incoming pion beam .",
    "each beam counter signal was electronically fanned  out and fed to a constant  fraction  discriminator ( cfd ) .",
    "the counter voltages and cfd thresholds were set so that all minimum ionizing particles were detected but the thermionic tube noise was not .",
    "a second signal from the s2b counter was fed to a leading - edge discriminator in which the threshold was set to detect only very large pulse height signals ( s2bh ) , corresponding to the proton contamination in the incident beam during @xmath3 running .",
    "inversion of the s2bh output ( @xmath24 ) thus indicated a `` no  proton '' event .",
    "use of this signal together with a differential absorber at the channel mid - plane reduced proton contamination in the beam definition to @xmath250.1% .    an incident particle was identified electronically by the four  fold coincidence @xmath26 .",
    "the logic signal s2b defined the timing for the entire system .",
    "the tight angular definition of this telescope of beam counters ensured that all beam coincidences corresponded to a particle at the target ( except for those pions which decayed or suffered hadronic interaction prior to reaching the target , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : beamloss ] ) . particle identification ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : beamcomp ] ) was realized by measuring the relative times - of - flight ( tof ) of the particles down the pion channel , values obtained from the time differences between the beam coincidence and the tcap signal , the latter a signal produced by a capacitive pickup in the primary proton beam line .    in order to monitor the incident beam , a special `` beam samples '' trigger ( sample )",
    "was constructed which utilized only beam coincidences selected randomly by an adjustable clock pulse .",
    "since the vast majority of beam triggers did not cause events , this trigger provided an unbiased sample of events striking the beam counters .    in order to assess the fraction of beam coincidences consisting of more than one pion , pions detected in the two buckets following the one that triggered the spectrometer were also monitored .",
    "circuits were constructed to detect beam hits in 2 and 3 consecutive beam buckets after an initial beam event . according to poisson statistics ,",
    "the probability of at least one hit occurring in each of ` m ' consecutive beam buckets is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the probability of a pion occurring in a single beam bucket .",
    "this relationship was found to be well reproduced throughout the experiment . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : multpion ] , such information was required to correct the beam rate for those events characterized by more than one pion in a beam bucket .",
    "for all of our @xmath29 measurements , the channel slit width was set at 18 mm , corresponding to a 1% fwhm @xmath30p / p momentum spread @xcite . for the @xmath31 runs where the fluxes were lower , the momentum spread was set at 2% , except for 267 mev , where it was 2.5% .",
    "the channel jaws were adjusted at each energy to provide typically 1.5mhz and 2mhz target rates for @xmath29 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "a comprehensive beam tuning and calibration program @xcite was undertaken immediately prior to the experiment in order to gain a detailed understanding of the pion beam characteristics .",
    "two issues which arose from those studies deserve particular mention .",
    "the spot size and divergence of the beam at our target location were found to vary slightly with the aperture of the front ",
    "end rate restricting jaws in the channel .",
    "consequently , the values of the jaw apertures were recorded for all data - taking runs , since knowledge of the beam size and divergence was required for accurate modelling by the monte carlo simulation programs ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : data_anal ] and and appendix  [ appdx : simuldetails ] ) .",
    "it was also found that although the pion beam trajectory and size were rather insensitive to the horizontal position of the primary proton beam on the beryllium pion production target , they were somewhat sensitive to the vertical position . to monitor beam movement , a square",
    ", four - paddle hodoscope centred on the beam was placed 2480 mm downstream of the target location . the rate on each hodoscope paddle was continuously monitored and written to the data acquisition stream throughout the experiment .",
    "as the central pion momentum transmitted by the channel is linearly related to the magnetic field strength of the first channel dipole ( b1 ) measured by an nmr probe set at the magnet mid - plane , momentum calibrations were carried out during the tuning phase of the experiment and again near its completion , using the traditional technique ( ssbd ) @xcite of stopping light ions produced at the production target in a silicon counter in vacuum at the beam pipe exit .",
    "however , after the experiment , we were made aware @xcite of a pulse - height defect issue @xcite which rendered these results unreliable .",
    "consequently , another detailed calibration was performed subsequent to the experiment by measuring pion  electron tof differences between scintillators contained within an evacuated beam pipe in the experimental area , and also between the tcap signal from the protons in the primary beam line and a scintillator in the experimental area .",
    "the technique exploits the fact that the electrons travel at essentially the speed of light and so provide an absolute velocity scale .",
    "details are provided in ref .",
    "data from these measurements ( fig .  [",
    "fig : m11-calib ] ) yielded the m11 channel momentum calibration : @xmath32 = 326.7\\cdot(\\mbox{b1}-0.00171)\\pm 0.2\\%\\ ] ] where b1 is the magnetic field strength in tesla , and the @xmath180.2% uncertainty in @xmath33 corresponds to the spread in the calibration points from the best fit line shown in fig .

    "[ fig : m11-calib ] as well .",
    "the @xmath340.25% discrepancy in momentum between this calibration and the new one is consistent with the size of the pulse - height defect effects discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite0.5 mev was quoted by brack _",

    "( for the lh@xmath4  target ) , and half the target material at the appropriate angle were determined using the full bethe ",
    "bloch equation @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty in this energy loss was estimated as 10% of the total loss ( @xmath7t@xmath12 typically 2 mev ) , and was added in quadrature to the @xmath180.20% momentum uncertainty calibration to give the total uncertainty . although the pion beam energy was fine - tuned for each different target configuration to give the desired energy at the target centre , the energies were _ not _ similarly adjusted for the corresponding background runs , since the backgrounds were small as was the energy - dependence of the background itself .",
    "the variations in the cross sections associated with the resulting momentum uncertainty are less than about 1.7% for both our @xmath29p and @xmath31p data .",
    "the tof spectrometer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geantfig1 ] consisted of the beam monitoring scintillators , six arms consisting of pairs of thin scintillation counters to detect the scattered pions , and six conjugate arms of thin scintillation counters to detect the recoil protons during coincidence running . use of thin transmission scintillators ensured virtually 100% detection efficiency with negligible edge effects for both @xmath29 and @xmath31 as well as protons .",
    "a pion arm consisted of a two  counter telescope viewing the target , with each telescope comprised of two 3.2 mm thick ne102 scintillators wrapped by a single layer of 0.025 mm aluminum foil and 0.26 mm polyvinylchloride electrical tape .",
    "the scintillators were attached to the phototubes via lucite light guides .",
    "the telescopes were bolted onto a machined table , with both scintillators of each arm positioned using a transit located at the target centre , enabling the angular positions to be known to better than @xmath180.2@xmath2 .",
    "the solid angle defining ` @xmath62 ' counters were on average 40.03@xmath180.06 mm wide by 99.90@xmath180.09 mm high @xcite and were mounted 1231@xmath183 mm from the target centre .",
    "the ` @xmath61 ' counters were 49 mm by 165 mm , and situated 792 mm from the target centre .",
    "these dimensions and separations were chosen in order to define a projected spot size of @xmath3460 mm horizontal , @xmath34200 mm vertical at the target , large enough to cover the whole interaction region while not severely restricting the acceptance to muons arising from decay of scattered pions .",
    "for those runs involving coincidence detection ( )  of both pions and protons , a set of six 90 mm by 400 mm by 3.2 mm thick ( ` p1 ' ) scintillators were used as the recoil ",
    "proton detection arms .",
    "these scintillators were viewed from both the top and bottom by phototubes coupled to lucite light guides bent at 90@xmath2 so that the phototubes pointed radially .",
    "the scintillators were situated 926@xmath183 mm from the target .",
    "the base plates for these counters were positioned also on a machined table using a transit , with slight adjustments provided in order for the proton counters to be moved after every energy change to the angles conjugate to the scattered pions .",
    "an accuracy of about @xmath180.1@xmath2 was achieved in the angular positions .",
    "pions scattered into the pion arms were identified by a @xmath61@xmath352 coincidence between counters in the same arm , in any one of the six telescopes ( i.e. @xmath36 ) .",
    "phototube voltages and discriminator thresholds were set just above the noise signals and at about 35% of the smallest pion pulses to ensure that no good pion events would be lost .",
    "particles were identified by their tof to the @xmath62 counters relative to the beam signal .",
    "although neither the timing nor pulse height information from @xmath62 could distinguish pions from those muons arising from pion decay between the target and @xmath62 , this small muon contribution could be accurately accounted for by monte carlo .",
    "the @xmath61 counters were positioned such that pions passing through them would not strike the @xmath62 light guide near the phototube junction , which would enable forward  going @xmath20erenkov radiation to be detected , but nevertheless a check was made with the @xmath61 counters out of the event coincidence . in this case the false events produced by the @xmath20erenkov radiation were easily discriminated against with a timing cut , since the the light arising from true events hitting the @xmath62 scintillator counters had a longer path length to traverse before reaching the phototube .",
    "proton arm events were signalled by a coincidence between the up and down tubes of each of the p1 counters .",
    "logic signals obtained by discriminating with cfds were then fed to a meantimer to establish the timing gate .",
    "prior to performing the actual experiment , each counter was placed in the beam , and the phototube voltages and discriminator thresholds were adjusted to cut half  way into the ( minimum ionizing ) electron signal , thus ensuring that all protons were detected .",
    "candidate scattering events ( arm ) were identified by the coincidence of beam with the coincidence output of signals from a pion arm and its conjugate proton arm ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the timing was set such that only relatively fast particles in the pion arm and relatively slow particles in the proton arm would satisfy the @xmath38p coincidence .",
    "the scattering yield was obtained from the spectra of tof differences of particles to the pion counters relative to those to the proton counters .",
    "the tight geometry of the counter pairs greatly suppressed the dominant 3body quasi ",
    "elastic @xmath39 background , and , combined with the timing requirement , also suppressed the quasi ",
    "free absorption @xmath40 background .",
    "these backgrounds for the two  arm coincidence measurements _ never _ exceeded 7% of the foreground at any angle or energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : fgbgnet ] shows the yield spectrum for the _ worst case_.    with the system set up as described , data were obtained for both @xmath3 and @xmath41 for the pion lab angles 60 , 75 , 95 , 115 , 135 , 155 ( `` set a '' ) at all energies with @xmath42 , and an additional set at 55 , 65 , 85 , 105 , 125 , 145 ( `` set b '' ) for a few @xmath3p energies with @xmath43 .",
    "the proton angles were adjusted at each beam energy to the appropriate values conjugate to those of the pion arms .",
    "the possibility of an arm@xmath44 coincidence being generated by the detection of a proton in the pion arm and a pion in the proton arm was completely eliminated in all but a single case by the tight kinematical constraints imposed by the pion ",
    "proton counter pairs .",
    "the one case where such events could occur was in the `` set b '' configuration where both the pion and proton angles were @xmath3455@xmath2 .",
    "these events were easily separated from the true events by the tof timing difference , and therefore did not present a problem in the analysis .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geantfig1 ] , the targets were arranged such that the pion arms faced the upstream surface of the target ( with respect to the incident beam ) , whereas the proton arms faced the downstream surface to minimize proton energy loss and multiple scattering .",
    "the target angles were chosen to minimize the target thickness for the lowest energy protons . the requirement that these protons not suffer excessive energy loss and multiple scattering on the way to the p1 counter limited the proton angle to a maximum of about 55@xmath2 at the lowest energy ( 141 mev ) , corresponding to a minimum pion angle of @xmath3455@xmath2 . for most runs ( `` set a '' ) , the forward ",

    "determination of the pion fraction f@xmath12 proceeded in two steps : removal of the proton contribution in the beam , and determination of the beam contamination due to muons and electrons originating near the pion production target .",
    "protons were effectively removed from the beam by means of differential energy loss within the channel provided by a midplane absorber before the second bending magnet , and a @xmath90 upper level discriminator used to reject the residual ( large pulse height ) protons . however , at the highest two beam energies involved in the experiment , some protons managed to leak into the beam definition .",
    "these protons were easily identified by the tcap sample spectrum and large pulse heights in all the in  beam counters .",
    "as the corrections due to these protons were never large ( @xmath250.5% ) , their presence only introduced a small additional uncertainty to f@xmath12 ( @xmath250.1% ) .",
    "the muon and electron contamination of the pion beam arising from pion decay near the pion production target was readily determined using particle tof to the s2b counter . at low beam energies ( @xmath91 110 mev ) , the length of the channel allowed all three components to be easily resolved during normal operation @xcite .",
    "however at higher energies , the poor time resolution imposed by the normal 3 ns width of the proton beam buckets limited the clean separation of particles , and , for most of the energies involved in the experiment , this limitation meant that the muon ( and at the highest energies even the electron ) components were obscured by the dominant pion peak .",

    "in addition , some runs were obtained with the momentum slit widths varied between 0.5% and 2.5% . since only beam counter information was required for these tests , all pion and proton arms were removed from the event definition .",
    "the @xmath6:@xmath19:e ratios were determined from gaussian fits to the tcap timing spectra .",
    "all three peaks were cleanly separated except at the highest two energies , where the muon peak was obscured by the tail of the pion distribution . however , by fixing the muon peak position using the expected @xmath6@xmath19 and @xmath19e tof differences at those momenta , robust fits were found .",

    "such results are not unexpected .",
    "as the muons originate from a more distributed source at the production target , and so are not focussed as well as the pions at the midplane , the @xmath6/(@xmath93 ) fraction should depend on midplane slit setting . consequently , narrow slit settings favour the pions over the muons .",
    "this effect was expected to be even larger for the electrons , since their source was even more spatially distributed , and they were a much larger fraction of the @xmath31 beam than were the muons .",

    "as there were many fewer muons and positrons in the @xmath29 beam , such effects were much less significant there .",
    "the revmoc @xcite simulations also showed that the fractions depended on the geometry of the beam counters , since larger ( smaller ) counters would intercept a larger ( smaller ) fraction of the muons and electrons which tend to form a halo around the pion beam .",

    "although the muon contribution in the tcap spectra was obscured by the pion peak during normal running , the electron peaks could be easily identified for incident pion energies up to 218 mev . because the time structure during normal operation resulted in 2 ( sometimes 3 ) well - defined timing peaks , multiple gaussian line shapes were fit to the pion peaks , with the phase - restricted beam results used to constrain the muon and electron peak amplitudes and centroids .",

    "[ fig : tcap_normalfit ] . during normal beam operation ,",
    "the timing spectra possessed small `` right hand '' tails .",
    "the fact that these tails were due to pions and beam contamination was inferred from the fact that they were apparent for single @xmath6p events , of the form @xmath97p@xmath98 event , since only pions could yield a ( pion arm)(proton arm ) coincidence . by fitting the electron peak together with the pion tail",

    "the results for f@xmath12 extracted in the above manner were used in the cross section calculations , whereas at the higher energies , the phase - restricted beam results were used .",
    "since the @xmath31 results were always between the results for the two phase - restricted beam series , the estimates at the higher energies were not expected to vary by more than @xmath340.5% from those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prt_fractions ] .    the precise nature of the quantity , f@xmath12 , should be emphasized here . since muons from those pions which decay _",
    "after _ the channel exit could not be distinguished from pions by tof ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rev_m11-inchannel ] ) , the `` pion fraction '' defined above contains a contribution from these decay muons .",
    "the fraction f@xmath12 thus represents the fraction of the beam at the last channel element that consists of those pions , muons , and electrons that would _ subsequently _ cause a beam coincidence .",
    "however , to obtain the fraction of beam coincidences due to _ pions _ in the _ target _ , f@xmath12 had to be corrected for pion decay in the channel and downstream of the channel exit ( f@xmath87 ) and for hadronic interaction losses ( f@xmath88 ) .",
    "pion decay downstream of the last channel element , f@xmath87 , was calculated in a straightforward fashion by monte carlo simulation using the geant @xcite program .",
    "neglecting hadronic interaction losses , the factor f@xmath87 represented the fraction of the pions at the exit ( quadrupole ) magnet midplane which would subsequently produce a beam coincidence and hit the target . since this factor was dependent on the beam counter geometry and beam phase space , the simulations",
    "were carried out for each run using the beam phase - space parameters measured during the channel tuning phase of the experiment .",
    "the results for f@xmath87 varied between 0.961 at 141 mev and 0.973 at 267 mev , and were rather insensitive to the beam size . considering the decay correction only up to the s2b counter , the pion survival fraction was 0.992 , virtually independent of energy and beam size .",
    "as the energy increases , fewer pions decay , but since the muon cone angle is smaller , more of the decay muons are detected .",
    "these geant results for the pion decay to the s2b counter and to the target were checked using the revmoc @xcite beam transport program , with the two simulations agreeing to better than 0.1% at all energies .",
    "one source of muons not yet discussed was that originating from pion decay within the channel . as the muons appearing in the muon peak possessed the largest tof difference with respect to the pions , they originated near the production target . since the @xmath99 tof difference for muons originating",
    "after the last channel magnet was smaller than the instrumental timing resolution , they would consequently appear under the pion peak .",
    "muons originating between the production target and the last magnet would have a timing distribution spread between these two extremes .",
    "the results from the lower energy phase - restricted beam fits show that the size of this contribution was significantly smaller than that from the muons originating from the production target , since a clear gap existed between the pion and muon peaks .",
    "the contribution was expected to be small since most decay muons emerge at an angle to the direction of the incident pion ( the `` jacobi angle '' , varying from @xmath349@xmath2 at 140 mev to @xmath346@xmath2 at 270 ) with a momentum different from the pion , so these muons would either strike the beam pipe walls or be bent away from the rest of the beam by the magnets .",
    "nevertheless , a monte carlo simulation of the pions and their decay muons from the production target through the beam line to the in  beam counters and scattering target was undertaken using the revmoc @xcite beam transport program @xcite .",
    "[ fig : rev - vs - beam ] shows the pion beam phase space parameters for two settings of the rate restricting jaws , demonstrating that the channel was well understood .",
    "this simulation confirmed that the contamination from muons originating between the production target and the channel exit was small , amounting to only about 0.2@xmath180.1% .",
    "this is seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : rev_m11-inchannel ] , which shows the time distribution of pions and muons originating from various points in the channel .",
    "therefore the correction f@xmath100f@xmath12 was utilized in the beam normalization factor for all data  taking runs .",
    "although the simulations discussed above neglected pion loss through hadronic interaction since neither the revmoc nor geant simulations of these interactions were sufficiently reliable for this application , the factor f@xmath12 _ already included _",
    "hadronic loss effects to the s2b counter , since it was measured experimentally in the phase - restricted beam runs .",
    "therefore , the only hadronic losses of pions that remained to be accounted for in the beam normalization factor were those in the ch@xmath48 or lh@xmath48 targets ( and shields , windows , etc .  in the case of the lh@xmath4 target ) , in the air , and in the s2b counter ( _ after _ a hit had been registered by the electronics ) .",
    "all the pions which interacted in the air and in the various shields and windows surrounding the lh@xmath4 target were assumed lost , since it was very unlikely that such pions would continue forward to the target .",
    "for the s2b counter , pion losses in the tape on the downstream face of the counter and in the final third of the scintillator were included .",
    "the maximum total hadronic loss correction calculated in this way was @xmath342.0% for the case of 168.8 mev @xmath29 in the lh@xmath4 target oriented at 60@xmath2 , with the largest contribution being that of pion loss to inelastic channels in the target .",
    "the uncertainty in this value due to the various assumptions and hadronic cross section estimates was estimated to be about 10% arising from the uncertainties in the pion ",
    "nucleus cross section estimates with an additional 10% due to the assumptions concerning the interaction losses , implying a loss correction for the above case of @xmath52@xmath180.3% .      for a @xmath51 mhz pion rate ,",
    "implying delivery of a pion to the target area in only one out of every 25 beam buckets , the problem of signal pile - up characteristic of high intensity , low duty factor accelerators was negligible , since at these rates , using poisson statistics , the probability of multiple pions in a single beam bucket was only about 3% .",
    "a beam coincidence would indicate only that _ at least one _ particle had passed through all the beam counters , regardless of how many pions were delivered in a single beam bucket .",
    "therefore , when calculating cross sections , either the total beam counts , b , had to be increased appropriately to correct for events with more than one incident pion , or these events had to be rejected outright from the analysis . as a consistency check , both approaches were employed when determining the single ",
    "pion beam correction factor , f@xmath89 .",
    "the first of these methods , involving correcting the beam counts , b , was called the `` poisson '' correction scheme since the number of pions occurring in a single beam bucket was described by poisson statistics . in beam counter geometries where",
    "all the pions which could have reached the target must have passed through the counters , the correction to b would have been straightforward : if the probability of a pion occurring within a beam bucket is @xmath103 ( typically several percent ) , and @xmath104 is the frequency of the beam buckets ( 23.058 mhz ) , then the actual rate of pions traversing the beam - defining counters would be @xmath105 , whereas the rate indicated by the counter scalers would be the rate of one or more pions per bucket , or @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , the correction factor for the beam - defining counters would have been @xmath107    in our case , however , a small portion of the pion beam _ missed _ the beam - defining counters , yet still traversed the target . consequently ,",
    "if one or more pions traversed the target _ in addition _ to the one which travelled through the beam counters , the chance of a @xmath108 interaction would have increased correspondingly . if the probability per beam bucket of finding a pion able to traverse the target was @xmath109 , ( thus a true pion rate on target of @xmath110 ) , then the probability that the pion _ also _ passed through the beam - defining counters was @xmath111 and the probability that it missed was @xmath112 . in this case , the actual pion rate traversing the target _ and _ associated with a count in the beam counters is @xmath113=@xmath114 , which replaces the @xmath105 used previously .",
    "thus the multiple pion beam correction @xmath115 for the case where the beam counters do not intercept all the incident beam is : @xmath116    to use eq .",
    "[ eqn : poissoncorr ] , @xmath117 was obtained in a straightforward fashion from the observed rate of pions hitting _ both _ the beam counters _ and _ the target ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "determination of the rate of pions traversing the target ( @xmath118 ) had to be inferred from the observed veto counter rate ( @xmath119 ) ) , with @xmath120 given as above .",
    "the veto counter was designed to intercept the entire pion beam in the idealized case of no decay and interaction losses .",
    "these losses were accounted for using our revmoc @xcite beam simulation to obtain the correct target pion rate and fraction from the observed veto rate .",
    "these simulations showed that for @xmath29 beams , where the electron contamination was very low , the pion rate at the target was 97@xmath121% of the veto rate for all energies involved in the experiment .",
    "the simulation results were confirmed by test runs using a 15 cm diameter scintillator target ( the same size as the lh@xmath4 target ) with two different beam intensities , 1 and 2 mhz . for @xmath31 beams , the pion rate on target varied from about 85% of the veto rate at 140 mev to about 95% at 267 mev . the multiple pion correction factor , @xmath122 , was quite insensitive to the approximations involved in the revmoc modelling for the beam intensities involved ( @xmath341 mhz through the in  beam counters and @xmath341.5 - 2 mhz on target ) . at these intensities ,",
    "a @xmath185% variation in the target rate corresponded to @xmath1230.4% .",
    "the second of the multiple pion correction methods , outright rejection of such events , also was realized using the veto counter .",
    "since the chance of two pions in a single beam burst _ both _ interacting in the target was exceedingly small , then if one pion interacted causing a event , the other would pass through the target and be detected by the veto counter .",
    "such events were readily eliminated from the yields and the accumulated beam hits , b , were corrected appropriately . using similar notation to that of the previous section , the appropriate multiple pion `` veto '' correction factor was f@xmath124 = ( beam events hitting target with only 1 pion in bucket)/(measured beam ) . that is : @xmath125 since @xmath117 was known , and @xmath126 and @xmath49 obtained as described above , eq .  [",
    "eqn : vetocorr ] was easily evaluated .      to test our two prescriptions for the multiple pion correction factor ,",
    "two - arm data at 168.8 mev were obtained for five pion beam rates on the lh@xmath4 target : 0.34 , 0.87 , 1.4 , 3.1 , and 6.7 mhz .",
    "one empty target run with a 1.5 mhz rate was used for background subtraction in all cases . since the beam rate was adjusted using the front end jaws of the pion channel , the pion beam size on target also changed .",
    "however , geant simulations showed that the effect of the jaw changes on the experimental solid angle was less than 0.2% .",
    "consequently , the solid angles corresponding to the normal beam size were used in all cases .",
    "the cross section results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratetest ] .",
    "the beam correction factors varied from 1% at 0.34 mhz , 4% at 1.4 mhz , to 26% at 6.7 mhz .",
    "the maximum difference between the cross sections corrected by the veto and poisson schemes was 0.3% at 6.7 mhz , and smaller at the lower rates . as is evident from this figure , no monotonic systematic variation within the statistical uncertainties ( @xmath341.3% )",
    "was observed in the cross sections over this range .",
    "for all two  arm production  runs , the cross sections corrected by the poisson and veto schemes never differed by more than 0.3% , the former being usually slightly larger than the latter , consistent with expectation based on those events which should have been vetoed but were not , as discussed in sec .  [ sec : yields_mult ] .",
    "the average of the poisson and veto corrected cross sections were used for the two  arm results .",
    "however , for the single  arm  runs at 141.2 , 168.8 , and 218.1 mev , a much larger variation in the cross sections calculated with the two correction schemes was observed .",
    "the poisson correction factors for these runs were the same as those for the two - arm runs ( at the same beam rate and energy ) , whereas the veto correction factors were considerably larger , especially for the target empty runs .",
    "although the average discrepancy between the poisson and veto corrected cross sections averaged only about 0.7% , a systematic dependence with angle was observed , with the veto  corrected cross sections 1 - 2% smaller than the poisson corrected results at 20@xmath1 , increasing to be similarly larger than the poisson at 70@xmath1 .",
    "since the poisson scheme relied solely on the measured beam rates , the resulting correction should have been independent of pion angle as indeed was observed .",
    "the most likely explanation is that pion reactions on the background nuclei ( mostly carbon ) resulted in more than one charged particle in the final state , with one of them a pion detected by the tof spectrometer , and one of the others a particle detected by the veto counter .",
    "the fact that the most forward angles were associated with the largest background is consistent with the most forward angle yielding the largest discrepancy .",
    "this is also consistent with the abnormally large correction required for the empty target runs where the yield is almost solely from reactions on a@xmath234 nuclei .",
    "since the veto correction technique was less reliable for these single - arm runs , only the poisson correction scheme was used in that case .",
    "such effects were _ not _ a concern for the two - arm runs , since in that case the backgrounds were very much lower , and the coincidence requirement between the pion and proton arms severely restricted the phase space available for background reactions yielding another charged particle with a trajectory intercepting the veto counter .",
    "the scattering yield at the pion scattering angle specific to a particular tof spectrometer arm , y(t@xmath127 ) , for a given number of incident pions onto the target , n@xmath12 , was obtained by accumulating @xmath62p1 tof difference events in the two - arm coincidence case , or by the @xmath62 tof events in the single - arm case . the desired scattering",
    "yield y(t@xmath12,@xmath128 ) in eq .",
    "[ eqn : dsig ] was obtained by subtracting an appropriately normalized background yield from the foreground , as the foreground yield contained contributions from both @xmath6p scattering on the hydrogen nuclei as well as other pion scattering reactions on the surrounding material which managed to satisfy the kinematical and geometrical constraints of the tof spectrometer .",
    "noting that the incident pion kinetic energies in the foreground and background runs were within 0.5 mev in all cases , the @xmath6p scattering yield was determined from : @xmath129 where @xmath130 are the yields , @xmath131 the efficiencies , @xmath132 the number of incident pions , @xmath133 the areal target densities , @xmath134 the solid angles , and @xmath135 the target angles of the foreground and background targets .",
    "apart from the obvious dependence on target and beam , the foreground / background normalization factor , @xmath136(@xmath137 , also depended on the pion angle .",
    "this dependence , due to the fact that the effective solid angle ( @xmath76 ) differed ( @xmath251% ) between the foreground and background targets , arose mostly because of different proton multiple scattering and/or pion and proton hadronic interaction losses in the two targets .",
    "the differences in the foreground and background solid angles for the two - arm coincidence setups could be reliably determined by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "also , the particular value of @xmath136 used in the cross section calculations also depended on which multiple pion correction scheme ( poisson or veto ) was used , since they used different beam corrections .",
    "for the two - arm coincidence technique , the foreground tof difference peaks were narrow gaussians with @xmath138ps .",
    "most of the observed background under the foreground peak stemmed from pion quasi - elastic scattering from protons bound in heavier nuclei ( mostly carbon ) in the target region .",
    "this background was almost negligible for the smaller angles at 141 mev , and reached a maximum level of about 7% for 218 mev reactions in the ch@xmath48 target at backward angles , as illustrated in fig .",

    "slightly wider / narrower gates were used to check the sensitivity to the cut placement , and any differences were included in the overall statistical uncertainty .      when dealing with the multiple pion events , due care had to be directed to the yield definition as well as to the beam normalization .",

    "although these events were rejected using the veto cut , the incident beam count was also corrected for such events , so the effect cancels , the net result being simply a loss of statistics .    in the second case , where two ( or more ) pions were incident on the target in a beam burst , with one causing a @xmath97p event , and the other continuing on to the veto paddle",

    "@xcite data were included in the kh80 database with _ no _ normalization uncertainties , but were assigned 5% normalization uncertainties in the sm95 database ( compared to the 0% quoted @xcite and the 1% provided subsequently @xcite ) in order to resolve an inconsistency between the single - energy and global fits in the sm95 solution . the increased uncertainty , hence reduced weight , of the bussey et al . , data resulted in a solution more consistent with the global database .",
    "the generally good agreement between our results and the sm95 predictions demonstrate that our results are more compatible with the global database in the vicinity of the delta resonance than were the previous measurements .",
    "in addition , we have provided data with superior statistical precision .",
    "the precision is such that shape differences due to the difference in the small d - waves between the sm95 and kh80 solutions are clearly seen in the data at the highest energies .",
    "although the full impact of our data can only be appreciated after a new global pwa fit , the consistency between our data and the sm95 pwa solution permit some preliminary observations .",
    "the sm95 solution provides a good fit to the total cross section results of pedroni et al .",
    "@xcite , but much less so to those of carter et al .",
    "@xcite ( which are larger than pedroni on the left - wing of the resonance ) , so our data support the former data set .",
    "our data also support the value of the @xmath6nn coupling constant derived from the sm95 solution , @xmath1490.076 , over that of kh80 ( 0.079 ) , a result which can be traced to the smaller mass and narrower width of the delta resonance in the sm95 solution compared to kh80 .",
    "the lower value of the coupling constant is known to resolve long standing inconsistencies in the goldberger - treiman discrepancy @xcite and dashen - weinstein sum rule @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6n sigma term from sm95 and subsequent preliminary solutions which include our data @xcite seem to indicate a sigma term _ larger _ than the canonical result @xcite , thereby _ increasing _ the discrepancy with the theoretical result @xcite .",
    "however , since the sigma term is a very difficult quantity to extract from the @xmath6n data , definitive conclusions can not be reached at this time .",
    "the primary goal of our experiment was to provide absolute differential cross section data with small and _ reliable _ uncertainties at energies spanning the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "in addition , the results of many test measurements proved invaluable in elucidating the nature of systematic errors which were subsequently corrected or accounted for in the uncertainties .",
    "the satisfying internal consistency of our results demonstrates that our goal of obtaining reliable estimates of systematic uncertainties was successfully attained .",
    "it also demonstrates that the techniques employed in this experiment and shared by the previous work of brack et al .",
    "@xcite , such as the use of solid targets , were reliable , despite criticisms to the contrary ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    these data",
    "resolve a long standing controversy regarding the inconsistency of cross section values around the delta resonance with those at lower energies .",
    "consequently , inclusion of the results of this work will result in a more consistent database than was previously available . as a result of the improved consistency in the database and the increased precision of these data over previous results , more accurate and reliable determinations of the @xmath6nn coupling constant and @xmath6n sigma term",

    "hadronic elastic and quasi - elastic interactions were included to simulate pion hadronic rescattering into the pion arms from the cryostat vessel and target ring .",
    "however , as the hadronic rescattering corrections were never large , but only up to 1% in the forward angle single arm runs , even a large uncertainty there would not increase the overall solid angle uncertainty appreciably . in practice ,",
    "an additional uncertainty of 33% of the additional correction was applied in those cases .",
    "a specific test was carried out to check these rescattering corrections . in this test",
    ", the proton arms were removed from the event coincidence .",
    "though now in single  arm detection mode , the proton arm information was still recorded , so both single - arm and two - arm yields were obtained _ simultaneously_. comparison of the single - arm and two - arm cross - sections _ without _ including pion hadronic rescattering in the vacuum vessel and target ring showed that the single  arm results were systematically larger than the two  arm results by about 1 to 4% ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lastfigure ] ) .",

    "quasi_-elastic rescattering in the vacuum vessel appear in the background software box , and this increase closely mimics the increase of the _ elastic _ rescattering in the true yield box .",
    "uncertainties arise from the counting statistics in the software boxes , and from the fact that the quasi - elastic rescattering contribution does not necessarily match exactly the elastic contribution .",
    "the additional uncertainties are not expected to be bigger than about a third of the total rescattering correction .",
    "the results from this method also are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lastfigure ] , and are seen to agree with the simulated hadronic rescattering corrections .    unlike the pion ( quasi-)elastic rescattering corrections , the hadronic inelastic interaction _ losses _ of the pions and protons through the target , air ( and for pions ,",
    "the @xmath61 counter ) on their way to their respective counters were relatively large ( up to 7% ) .",
    "a program was developed to calculate these losses , since it was found that the geant simulations were unreliable .",
    "consequently , the hadronic losses were determined using the program and then applied _ post priori _ to the geant solid angle results calculated with hadronic inelastic interaction disabled .",
