    "the link with @xcite s available potential energy framework comes from the fact that lorenz s reference state , i.e. , the state whose potential energy is minimised by an adiabatic re - arrangement of the fluid parcels , coincides with the above - mentioned pdf , which was exploited by @xcite to provide a new way to rigourously quantify irreversible mixing simply from diagnosing the temporal evolution of the reference state . in a boussinesq fluid with a linear equation of state , the role of entropy",

    "it was pointed out by @xcite that this equality is a serendipitous artifact of the l - boussinesq model , which does not hold for more accurate forms of the equations of motion .",

    "historically , the buoyancy flux @xmath128 is the one that was initially regarded as the natural quantity to use for that purpose in an overwhelming majority of past studies of turbulent mixing . as a result , most existing studies of turbulent mixing define the turbulent diapycnal diffusivity , mixing efficiency , and flux richardson number in terms of the buoyancy flux as follows : @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 it is easily verified that the above equations are consistent with those considered by @xcite for instance .",
    "physically , however , there are fundamental problems in using the buoyancy flux to quantify irreversible diffusive mixing , because as pointed out by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xmath108 represents a reversible energy conversion , which usually takes on both large positive and negative values before settling on its long term average @xmath129 .",

    "the fact that the two terms are never exactly equal in a real fluid clearly refutes @xcite s widespread interpretation that @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath2 physically represents the same energy conversion whereby the diffusively dissipated @xmath1 is irreversibly converted into @xmath3 . in reality ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath2 represent two distinct types of energy conversions that happen to be both controlled by stirring and molecular diffusion in related ways , which explains why they appear to be always strongly correlated , and even exactly equal in the idealised limit of the l - boussinesq model . if one accepts the above point , then it should be clear that what is now required to make progress is the understanding of what controls the behaviour of the parameter @xmath8 , since the knowledge of the latter is obviously crucial to make inferences about turbulent diapycnal mixing from measuring the net changes of @xmath3 for instance .",
    "the purpose of the numerical simulations described next is to help gaining insights into what controls @xmath8 .",

    "the imposition of a fixed buoyancy profile @xmath9 , salinity @xmath170 , pressure range , and minimum temperature @xmath171 was found to yield widely different top - bottom temperature differences @xmath172 , ranging from a few tenths of degrees to about @xmath173 degrees c depending on the case considered , as seen in fig .",

    "specific details for the temperature , pressure , and salinity in each of the 27 experiments can be found in table 1 along with other key quantities discussed below .    numerically , the two - dimensional domain used to quantify @xmath0 and @xmath2 was discretised into @xmath174 points in the horizontal and vertical , with @xmath175 .",
    "mass conserving coordinates were chosen in the vertical , and regular spatial cartesian coordinate in the horizontal . for practical purposes ,",
    "the vertical mass conserving coordinate can be regarded as standard height @xmath22 , as the differences between the two types of coordinates were found to be insignificant in the present context , and thus chose @xmath176 . in order to compute @xmath0 and @xmath2 for turbulent conditions , we modelled the stirring process by randomly shuffling the fluid parcels adiabatically from resting initial conditions .",
    "shuffling the parcels in such a way requires a certain amount of stirring energy , which is equal to the available potential energy @xmath1 of the randomly shuffled state .",
    "for each of the 27 particular reference stratifications considered , synthetic turbulent states were constructed by generating hundreds of random permutations of the fluid parcels , thus simulating the effect of adiabatic shuffling by the stirring process , in each case yielding a particular value of @xmath0 , @xmath109 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "one way to illustrate that @xmath2 depends more sensitively on the equation of state than @xmath0 is by plotting each quantity as a function of @xmath1 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "interestingly , the figure shows that all values of @xmath0 appear to be close to a linear straight line , with no obvious sensitivity to the particular value of @xmath97 .",

    "it is easy to convince oneself , however , that stratifications can be constructed which have the same value of @xmath1 , but widely different values of @xmath0 .    in order to understand how the equation of state affects @xmath2",

    "this is obviously the case when the vertical variations of @xmath182 can be neglected , as in this case @xmath183 , assuming the pressure to be hydrostatic .",

    ", we also computed the average ratio @xmath193 for each particular reference stratification .",
    "interestingly , we find that the classical case @xmath194 coincide with @xmath195 , as expected in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "we find , however , that the decrease in @xmath8 coincides with @xmath45 being an increasingly bad approximation of @xmath1 .",
    "as the latter implies that @xmath196 becomes increasingly important , it also implies that compressible effects become increasingly important .",
    "this suggests , therefore , that the effects of a nonlinear equation of state are apparently strongly connected to non - boussinesq effects , a topic for future exploration .    the key point of the present results is that while there exist stratifications such that @xmath187 to a good approximation , and hence that conform to classical ideas about turbulent mixing in a boussinesq fluid with a linear equation of state , there also exist stratification for which @xmath2 and @xmath0 differ radically from each other . the main reason why this is not more widely appreciated",
    "is suggested by the results summarised in table 1 , which shows that @xmath197 appears to hold well under normal temperature and pressure conditions , which are usually those encountered in most laboratory experiments of turbulent mixing . in that case , the classical results of boussinesq theory are applicable , and there is no problems in measuring the mixing efficiency of turbulent mixing events from measuring the net change in @xmath3 , as often done , e.g. , @xcite , in accordance with the definition of mixing efficiency proposed by @xcite and @xcite , since @xmath194 to a good approximation .",
    "temperature , salinity , and pressure conditions in the real oceans can be very different than in the laboratory , however , especially in the abyss . in the latter case ,",
    "the present results suggest not only that @xmath8 can potentially become very large and negative , but that the discrepancy between @xmath45 and @xmath1 can become significant to the point of making the boussinesq approximation and the neglect of compressible effects very inaccurate .",
    "this point seems important in view of the current intense research effort devoted to understanding tidal mixing in the abyssal oceans that was prompted a decade ago by the influential study by @xcite .",
    "the point is also important because values of mixing efficiency published in the literature have been traditionally been reported without mentioning the associated value of @xmath8 , which may explain part of the spread in the published values , and adds to the uncertainty surrounding this crucial parameter .",
    "the present results suggest that an important project would be to seek to reconstruct the missing values of @xmath8 , which is in principle possible if sufficient information about the ambient conditions are available .",
    "the nonlinearities of the equation of state for water or seawater make it possible for a stratification with given mean vertical buoyancy profile @xmath9 to have widely different vertical profiles of the parameter @xmath198 , depending on particular oceanic circumstances .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the sign and magnitude of @xmath15 greatly affect @xmath2  the turbulent rate of change of @xmath3  while they correspondingly little affect @xmath0 , the dissipation rate of @xmath1 . as a result ,",
    "the ratio @xmath141 is in general lower than unity , and sometimes even negative , for water or seawater .",
    "for this reason , the fact that @xmath0 and @xmath2 happen to be identical for a boussinesq fluid with a linear equation of state appears to be a very special case , which is rather misleading in that it fails to correctly address the wide range of values assumed by the parameter @xmath8 in the actual oceans , while also leading to the widespread erroneous idea that the diffusively dissipated @xmath1 is irreversibly converted into @xmath3 , and hence that turbulent mixing always increase @xmath25 . as far as we understand the problem , based on the analysis of @xcite , @xmath0 and @xmath2 represent two physically distinct kinds of energy conversion , the former associated with the dissipation of @xmath1 into ` dead ' internal energy , and the latter associated with the conversion between @xmath3 and the exergy part of internal energy .",
    "the former is always positive , while the latter can take on both signs , depending on the particular stratification .    from the viewpoint of turbulence theory ,",
    "the present results indicate that the equality @xmath111 obtained in the context of the l - boussinesq model by @xcite should only be construed as implying a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 , not as an indication that the diffusively dissipated @xmath1 is converted into @xmath3 .",
    "as the present results show , the correlation between the two rates strongly depends on the nonlinearities of the equation of state .",
    "fundamentally , @xmath0 and @xmath2 appear to be correlated because they both depend on molecular diffusion , and on the gradient of the adiabatic displacement @xmath199 of the isothermal surfaces from their reference positions .",
    "based on the present results , the ratio @xmath5 appears to be determined at leading order mostly by the sign and magnitude of @xmath200 .",
    "further work is required , however , to clarify the precise link between @xmath8 and @xmath15 under the most general circumstances , which will be reported in a subsequent paper .",
    "the present results are important , because they show that the two following ways of defining a flux richardson number @xmath140 and mixing efficiency @xmath51 , viz .",
    ", @xmath201 @xmath202 called the dissipation mixing efficiency and flux richardson number by @xcite , and @xmath203 @xmath204 as proposed by @xcite and @xcite , which are equivalent in the context of the l - boussinesq model , happen to be different in the context of a real compressible fluid , as the conversion rules @xmath205 @xmath206 now involve the parameter @xmath8 .",
    "note that historically the flux richardson number was defined by @xcite as `` the fraction of the kinetic energy which appears as the potential energy of the stratification . ''",
    "physically , the kinetic energy that appears as the potential energy of the stratification is the fraction of kinetic energy being converted into @xmath1 and ultimately dissipated by molecular diffusion .",
    "this fraction is therefore measured by @xmath0 , not by @xmath2 , since the latter technically represents the `` mechanically - controlled '' fraction of internal energy converted into @xmath3 , if one accepts @xcite s conclusions . from this viewpoint , it is @xmath144 rather than @xmath138 that appears to be consistent with @xcite s definition of the flux richardson number , and hence @xmath207 rather than @xmath208 that is consistent with @xcite s definition of mixing efficiency .    from a practical viewpoint , however , the above conceptual objections against @xmath208 and @xmath138 do not mean that it is equally physically objectionable to seek estimating the efficiency of mixing from measuring the net changes in @xmath3 taking place during a turbulent mixing event , as is commonly done , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "such a method is perfectly valid , owing to the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the present results show , however , that such an approach requires the knowledge of the parameter @xmath8 , which is usually not supplied . for most laboratory experiments performed at atmospheric pressure ,",
    "the issue is probably unimportant , as @xmath8 appears to be generally close to unity in that case .",
    "the issue becomes more problematic , however , for measurements carried out in the ocean interior , as there is less reason to assume that @xmath194 will be necessarily verified .",
    "a critical review of published values of @xmath51 would be of interest , in order to identify the cases potentially affected by a value of @xmath8 significantly different from unity .",
    "so far , we have only considered the case of an equation of state depending on temperature and pressure only , by holding salinity constant . in practice , however , many studies of turbulent mixing are based on the use of compositionally stratified fluids .",

    "<S> there exist two central measures of turbulent mixing in turbulent stratified fluids that are both caused by molecular diffusion : 1 ) the dissipation rate @xmath0 of available potential energy @xmath1 ; 2 ) the turbulent rate of change @xmath2 of background gravitational potential energy @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> so far , these two quantities have often been regarded as the same energy conversion , namely the irreversible conversion of @xmath1 into @xmath3 , owing to the well known exact equality @xmath4 for a boussinesq fluid with a linear equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , tailleux ( 2009 ) pointed out that the above equality no longer holds for a thermally - stratified compressible , with the ratio @xmath5 being generally lower than unity and sometimes even negative for water or seawater , and argued that @xmath0 and @xmath2 actually represent two distinct types of energy conversion , respectively the dissipation of @xmath1 into one particular subcomponent of internal energy called the ` dead ' internal energy @xmath6 , and the conversion between @xmath3 and a different subcomponent of internal energy called exergy @xmath7 . in this paper , the behaviour of the ratio @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> is examined for different stratifications having all the same buoyancy frequency @xmath9 vertical profile , but different vertical profiles of the parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath12 the hydrostatic pressure , @xmath13 the density , and @xmath14 the specific heat capacity at constant pressure , the equation of state being that for seawater for different particular constant values of salinity . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that @xmath8 and @xmath2 depend critically on the sign and magnitude of @xmath15 , in contrast with @xmath0 , which appears largely unaffected by the latter . </S>",
    "<S> these results have important consequences for how the mixing efficiency should be defined and measured in practice , which are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , turbulent diffusive mixing is a physical process that it is crucially important to parameterise well in numerical ocean models in order to achieve realistic simulations of the water mass properties and of the so - called meridional overturning circulation @xcite , which are two essential components of the large - scale ocean circulation that may interact with earth climate . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , much effort has been devoted over the past decades toward understanding the physics of turbulent mixing in stratified fluids , one important goal being the design of physically - based parameterisations of irreversible mixing processes for use in numerical ocean climate models .    at a fundamental level , </S>",
    "<S> turbulent molecular diffusion in stratified fluids is important for at least two distinct  although inter - related  reasons : 1 ) for transporting heat diffusively across isopycnal surfaces  a process often referred to as ` diapycnal mixing ' ; 2 ) for dissipating available potential energy , which contributes for a significant fraction  often called the mixing efficiency  of the total dissipation of available mechanical energy @xmath16 , i.e. , the sum of total kinetic energy @xmath17 and available potential energy @xmath1 , which are defined by : @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath13 is the density , @xmath20 is the three - dimensional velocity vector , @xmath21 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath22 is the vertical coordinate increasing upward , and @xmath23 the specific internal energy . </S>",
    "<S> the ape is defined as in @xcite as the difference between the potential energy @xmath24 of the fluid ( i.e. , the sum of the gravitational potential energy @xmath25 plus internal energy @xmath26 ) minus the potential energy @xmath27 of a reference state that is the state of minimum potential energy achievable in an adiabatic re - arrangement of the fluid parcels . </S>",
    "<S> as shown by @xcite , the @xmath1 and @xmath27 play a fundamental in the modern theory of turbulent mixing owing to the fact that by construction @xmath27 is only affected by irreversible processes ; as a result , measuring the time evolution of the reference state provides a direct and objective way to quantify the amount of irreversible mixing taking place during turbulent mixing events , which is now commonly exploited to diagnose mixing in numerical experiments , e.g. , @xcite .    in the oceans , </S>",
    "<S> turbulent diapycnal mixing is required to transfer heat downward from the surface at a sufficiently rapid rate to balance the cooling of the deep ocean by high - latitudes deep water formation . in the oceanographic literature , </S>",
    "<S> the most widely used approach to parameterise the vertical ( diapycnal ) eddy diffusivity @xmath28 is based on the osborn - cox model ( @xcite ) : @xmath29 which expresses @xmath28 in terms of either the turbulent viscous kinetic energy dissipation @xmath30 or turbulent diffusive dissipation of available potential energy @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the squared buoyancy frequency , and @xmath33 is the ratio of the ape to ke dissipation , which is often called the ` mixing efficiency ' , e.g. @xcite . expressing @xmath28 in terms of @xmath30 appears to have been first proposed by @xcite and @xcite in the context of stratospheric turbulent mixing , and adapted to the oceanographic case by @xcite . the definition of mixing efficiency as a dissipations ratio adopted in this paper appears to have been first proposed by @xcite .    since both @xmath34 and @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> are linked to the dissipation of mechanical energy of which @xmath17 and @xmath1 represent the two main dynamically important forms , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ krho_osborn ] ) makes it clear that turbulent diapycnal mixing is directly related to the mechanical energy input in the oceans , but this link has been so far very rarely exploited in numerical ocean models . </S>",
    "<S> rather , @xmath28 is often regarded as a tunable parameter whose value is adjusted to reproduce the main observed features of the oceanic stratification . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach was used by @xcite , who assumed the stratification to obey the vertical advective / diffusive balance : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the potential temperature , and @xmath37 the vertical velocity . </S>",
    "<S> physically , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ advection_diffusion ] ) states that the upward advection of cold water is balanced by the downward turbulent diffusion of heat , the rate of upwelling being set up by the rate of deep water formation . by using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ advection_diffusion ] ) as a model for stratification profiles in the pacific , @xcite concluded that the canonical value @xmath38 was apparently needed to explain the observed structure of the oceanic thermocline . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , however , the validity of @xcite s approach was questioned , as several observational studies found @xmath28 in the ocean interior to be typically smaller by an order of magnitude than munk s value , e.g. , see @xcite and the review by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it seems widely recognised today that @xmath28 is highly variable spatially , prompting @xcite to re - interpret the value @xmath39 as resulting from the overall effect of weak interior values combined with intense turbulent mixing in coastal areas or over rough topography .    while the above approach is useful , it does not exploit the link between @xmath28 and the mechanical sources of stirring suggested by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ krho_osborn ] ) . clarifying this link </S>",
    "<S> was pioneered by @xcite , who translated the advection / diffusion balance into one for the gravitational potential energy budget , which they argue must be a balance between the rate of @xmath25 loss due to cooling and the rate of @xmath25 increase due to turbulent diffusive mixing , i.e. , @xmath40 this result being obtained by multiplying eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ advection_diffusion ] ) by @xmath41 , after some manipulation involving integration by parts and the neglect of surface heating , where @xmath42 is the thermal expansion , @xmath21 the acceleration of gravity , @xmath43 a reference density , and @xmath22 the vertical coordinate pointing upward . </S>",
    "<S> the subscript @xmath44 is added here because it can be shown that @xcite must actually pertain to the background @xmath3 budget , rather than the @xmath45 budget , as shown by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from the fact that cooling and turbulent molecular diffusion act as a @xmath25 sink and source only for the background @xmath3 , as it is the opposite that holds for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes that density is primarily controlled by temperature for simplicity , the effect of mixing on @xmath3 is thus given by : @xmath46 @xmath47 by using the result that @xmath48 in absence of salinity effects , and by assuming @xmath49 at the ocean surface , and no flux through the ocean bottom . in their paper </S>",
    "<S> , @xcite neglected the nonlinearities of the equation of state , which amounts to regard @xmath42 as constant , in which case the above expression becomes : @xmath50 by using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ krho_osborn ] ) , assuming @xmath51 constant , this formula can be rewritten as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath0 and @xmath53 are the total volume - integrated diffusive dissipation of available potential energy and viscous dissipation of kinetic energy respectively . to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> @xcite linked the dissipation to production terms by assuming the balance @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the work rate done by the mechanical forcing due to the winds and tides . as a result , the above formula yields : @xmath56 by estimating the rate of @xmath25 loss due to cooling to be @xmath57 , and by using the canonical value @xmath58 , @xcite concluded that @xmath59 of mechanical energy input was required to sustain turbulent diapycnal mixing in the oceans . since the work of the wind stress against the surface geostrophic velocity is widely agreed to be @xmath60 </S>",
    "<S> , @xcite suggested that the shortfall should be explained by the work rate done by the tides . </S>",
    "<S> the issue remains controversial , however , because the role of the surface buoyancy forcing is not sufficiently well understood , as discussed in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another important issue in assessing the uncertainties associated with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gke_constraint ] ) concerns the importance of the nonlinearities of the equation of state , neglected by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , the nonlinearities of the equation of state are mostly responsible for the fluid `` contracting upon mixing '' . </S>",
    "<S> this contraction is responsible for the actual increase in @xmath3 due to mixing to be less than for a linear equation of state . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gpe_formula ] ) , this can be seen from the fact that @xmath61 is usually positive for a stably stratified fluid . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath22 is negative by assumption , it follows that a correction factor is required that modifies eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ closure ] ) as follows : @xmath62 @xmath63 where @xmath64 , which in turn modifies @xcite s constraint ( eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gke_constraint ] ) ) as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 . based on the above arguments , @xcite </S>",
    "<S> s results are expected to underestimate the constraint on @xmath55 , to the extent that @xmath51 and the rate of @xmath3 loss due to cooling can be kept fixed . </S>",
    "<S> this point was first pointed out by @xcite who emphasised the importance of cabelling . discussing the value of @xmath67 or @xmath8 to be used in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gke_constraint ] ) is beyond the scope of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that it is possible to construct stratifications with @xmath8 not only smaller than one but also possibly even negative , as discussed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter cases are interesting , because they are such that @xmath3 _ decreases _ upon mixing , not _ increases _ , in contrast to what is usually assumed .    </S>",
    "<S> the main reason that @xmath3 is often assumed to increase as a result of turbulent mixing stems from that for an incompressible fluid with a linear equation of state , eq . ( [ closure ] ) states that : @xmath68 i.e. , that @xmath3 increases at the same rate that @xmath1 decreases , which is classically interpreted as implying that the diffusively dissipated @xmath1 must be irreversibly converted into @xmath3 , e.g. , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pointed out , however , that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gper_dape ] ) is at best only a good approximation , not a true equality , since in reality the rates of @xmath3 increase and @xmath1 decrease are never exactly equal , and sometimes even widely different , because of the nonlinear character of the equation of state .    in order to better understand how the net change in @xmath3 correlates with the total amount of @xmath1 diffusively dissipated during an irreversible turbulent mixing event , </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to examine the process of turbulent mixing in the light of classical thermodynamic transformations . to make progress , the conditions under which the diffusive exchange of heat between fluid parcels takes place need to be known , but in practice this is problematic , for it would require solving the full compressible non - hydrostatic navier - stokes equations down to the diffusive scales </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , it is often the case that stratified fluids at low mach numbers are close to hydrostatic equilibrium , suggesting that the diffusive heat exchange between parcels may reasonably be assumed to occur at approximately constant pressure . </S>",
    "<S> if so , irreversible diffusive mixing must then be close to be a process conserving the total potential energy @xmath69 of the system , which implies that any amount @xmath70 of diffusively dissipated @xmath1 must be irreversibly converted into background @xmath27 , viz . , @xmath71 the implications for the net change in @xmath3 can be determined from the definitions @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , which imply : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the net change in background internal energy taking place during the irreversible mixing event . as a result , the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath67 previously defined become : @xmath77 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath78 eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xi_formula ] ) and ( [ cm_formula ] ) are important , because they establish that the nonlinearities of the equation of state  which are responsible for the temperature and pressure dependence of @xmath11  can give rise to internal energy changes @xmath76 comparable in magnitude with @xmath79 and @xmath80 during a turbulent mixing event . </S>",
    "<S> such large @xmath81 changes must in turn be associated with potentially large compressibility effects whose work against the pressure field may also expected to be large , as first demonstrated by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the above formula suggest that the nonlinearities of the equation of state may give rise to significant non - boussinesq effects . </S>",
    "<S> so far , however , most numerical ocean models still make the incompressible and boussinesq approximations , while at the same time using some version of the nonlinear equation of state for seawater . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach yields values of @xmath8 and @xmath67 that are predicted by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gpe_formula ] ) , but since those values ultimately derive from initially making the boussinesq approximation , it is unclear whether they can take into account the nonlinear character of the equation of state in a fully consistent manner .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , even when the net change @xmath76 appears to be small or negligible , seemingly justifying the incompressible assumption , @xcite argues that compressible effects may still be large , because one may show that @xmath76 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath82 where @xmath6 and @xmath83 are two subcomponents of @xmath81 called the ` dead ' and ` exergy ' components . </S>",
    "<S> physically , @xmath6 represents the internal energy of a notional thermodynamic equilibrium state of uniform temperature @xmath84 , whereas @xmath7 represents the internal energy associated with the vertical stratification of the reference state . </S>",
    "<S> an important result of @xcite is that the net changes in @xmath7 and @xmath6 are related at leading order to @xmath80 and @xmath79 as follows : @xmath85 @xmath86 to a very good approximation in a nearly incompressible fluid such as water or seawater . </S>",
    "<S> these relations state that turbulent molecular diffusion primarily dissipates @xmath1 into ` dead ' internal energy @xmath6 , while simultaneously causing a transfer between @xmath3 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the former effect results in an increase of the equivalent thermodynamic temperature @xmath84 , whereas the latter effect results in the smoothing out of @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with the standard interpretation that turbulent molecular diffusion irreversibly converts @xmath1 into @xmath3 , as proposed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the two interpretations are schematically illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . the main reason why compressibility effects may be important even if @xmath88 is because volume changes are primarily determined by @xmath89 , not by @xmath90 or @xmath76 .    as regards to the empirical determination of the mixing efficiency @xmath91 , the above remarks are important because @xmath80 and @xmath92 are currently widely thought to physically represent the same quantity , prompting many studies to actually estimate @xmath31 from measuring the net changes in @xmath3 , e.g. , @xcite . for the reasons discussed above </S>",
    "<S> , however , this makes sense only if @xmath8 can be ascertained to be close to unity , as if not , the relevant value of @xmath8 is then required . </S>",
    "<S> one of the main objective of this paper is to establish that the behaviour of @xmath8 is closely connected to the sign and amplitude of the following parameter : @xmath93 where @xmath11 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 is the density , and @xmath14 is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure , while salinity is assumed to be uniform throughout the domain . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the parameter @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the adiabatic lapse rate , represents the fraction of the amount of heat @xmath96 received by a parcel in an isobaric process that can be converted into work . as a result , @xmath97 is expected to be the main parameter controlling the net change in @xmath3 due to the turbulent diffusive heat exchange between fluid parcels .    from the viewpoint of turbulent mixing , </S>",
    "<S> the main difficulty posed by a nonlinear equation of state is to make it possible for different vertical stratification to share the same profile @xmath98 without necessarily having the same @xmath99 vertical profile . </S>",
    "<S> from a dynamical viewpoint , this is not expected to be a problem as long as the dynamical evolution of @xmath17 and @xmath1 , as well as @xmath53 and @xmath0 , remain mostly controlled by @xmath98 at leading order , as is usually assumed . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the dissipations ratio @xmath100 , and hence the bulk mixing efficiency @xmath51 , can then be assumed to be unaffected by the nonlinearities of the equation of state at leading order . </S>",
    "<S> the main objective of this paper is to verify that @xmath0 appears indeed to be largely insensitive to the @xmath99 vertical profile , and hence mostly controlled by @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> if so , we can safely conclude that it must also be the case for @xmath53 , since there is even less reasons to believe that the latter could be affected by @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this could be directly verified through direct numerical simulations of turbulent stratified mixing using a fully compressible navier - stokes equations solver , which we hope to report on in the future . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the net change in @xmath3 is expected to be extremely sensitive to @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the paper is devoted to verify that this is indeed the case , and to find ways to relate the net change in @xmath3 to the sign and magnitude of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> section 2 provides a theoretical formulation of the issue discussed . </S>",
    "<S> section 3 discusses the methodology , while the results are presented in section 4 . </S>",
