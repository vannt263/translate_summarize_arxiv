    "the functionality of natural multichromophoric complexes depends fully on the strength and structure of interactions between electronic states and vibrational degrees of freedom associated either to intramolecular vibrations or to intermolecular interactions with the protein and the surrounding solvent environment @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the phonon environment influencing electronic excitation dynamics can be broadly divided into two distinct components @xcite .",
    "firstly , a continuous distribution of modes with a characteristic cutoff frequency below or comparable to the thermal energy scale , @xmath0 . these modes , arising from the solvent and low - energy protein vibrations , induce thermal fluctuations of onsite energies which in turn drive transitions between energetically close excitonic states .",
    "secondly , spectroscopy studies @xcite also reveal the active participation of specific vibrational modes during excitation dynamics , often described as peaks in the spectral density characterising exciton - phonon interactions .",
    "vibrations with lower frequencies may arise from inter - molecular coupling between pigments and the local protein environment @xcite while peaks at high energies originate mostly from intramolecular vibrations that give rise to vibronic transitions @xcite .",
    "we denote these high - energy vibrational modes as _ quantized vibrations _ to indicate that their quantum mechanical features can be significant even at ambient temperatures @xcite .",
    "in contrast , vibrations with frequencies below @xmath0 will be thermally activated .",
    "indeed , the influence of quantized vibrations in energy transport in a variety of natural molecular systems is currently of central interest @xcite .    in this work",
    "we discuss the important role of quantized vibrations and their non - equilibrium dynamics for electronic excitations in the cryptophyte antennae protein phycoerythrin 545 ( pe545 ) @xcite , where exciton coherence beating has been observed @xcite .",
    "chromophores in cryptophyte light - harvesting antenna proteins have large energy gaps and are separated by an average distance of @xmath1 @xcite , which is double the average pigment distance in proteins of plants @xcite , hence the majority of electronic couplings in pe545 are small ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "how can this antenna protein function efficiently with such structure ? we show that a fundamental mechanism for the biological function of this complex and for supporting coherence oscillations at long - times is the coupling between excitons and vibrations quasi - resonant with excitonic energy differences .",
    "the importance of these interactions in similar light - harvesting systems has recently been highlighted by ultrafast spectroscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "vibrations reported in spectroscopy of pe545 have high - frequencies @xcite with the largest couplings for modes between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . given that these frequencies match closely energy gaps between exciton states , transport in pe545 is fundamentally activated by these vibrations giving rise to the transfer pathways and transfer times observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "this result can be anticipated using frster theory @xcite but is derived here using a non - markovian polaron - representation master equation for multichromophoric systems @xcite .",
    "this more general framework allows us to investigate the evolution of excitonic coherences and to show that non - equilibrium dynamics associated to such vibrations can contribute to the long - time oscillations of the coherences probed in recent ultrafast experiments @xcite .",
    "based on this analysis , we are able to elucidate two key features of excitation transfer assisted by vibrations in cryptophytes .",
    "first , excitation dynamics follows a non - sequential order bridging large energy gaps and distances and therefore generating faster and wider spatial distribution of excitation energy .",
    "second , vibrations that modulate the evolution of excitonic coherences also promote energy transfer to preferential sites in the complex .",
    "both of these process support biological function of the antennae by assuring that energy transfer to other photosynthetic complexes happens in the relevant biological time scale . on the basis of these results",
    "we argue that in complexes with highly localized excitons a fundamental role for quantum coherent contributions to dynamics is precisely to ensure that resonances with selected vibrations are tuned to guarantee faster and effective distribution of excitation energy .",
    "the interactions between excitons and quantized vibrations in close resonane with exciton gaps are therefore an important design principle for optimal light - harvesting antennae@xcite .",
    "cryptophyte photosynthesis relies on phycobiliproteins such as pe545 and phycocyanin 645 ( pc645 ) to ensure photon absorption in the visible part of the spectrum , with an optimal performance in the blue ( @xmath6 nm ) and green ( @xmath7 nm ) regions @xcite .",
    "excitation energy absorbed by cryptophyte antennae proteins is transferred towards photosystems ii and ii ( psi and psii ) @xcite .",
    "crystallography @xcite reveals that pe545 contains eight light - absorbing bilin molecules covalently bound to a four subunit protein scaffold labelled a , b , c and d ( see figure [ fig : subunits ] ) .",
    "the lowest - energy chromophores are 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin chromophores and are linked to separate protein subunits a and b ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the remaining six chromophores are phycoerythrobilin ( peb ) bilins , two of which are doubly covalently bound to the protein environment while the remaining four are singly bound .",
    "the peb bilins are arranged such that pigments @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 occupy the subunit c , while chromophores @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are attached to subunit d. one particular feature of this complex is that it contains a deep , water - filled slot exposing the pigments to a large contact with water .",
    "the combined pigment - protein structure is shown in figure [ fig : subunits ] , while the relative positions of the isolated pigments is illustrated in figure [ fig : chromophores ] .",
    "quantum chemical calculations @xcite as well as spectroscopy @xcite have allowed the refinement of a parametrized hamiltonian for the electronic structure of pe545 given by ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the operator that creates an excitation on site @xmath19 i.e. @xmath20 . a salient characteristic of this system is that site energy differences @xmath21 are very large in comparison to inter - site electronic interaction @xmath22 , for instance , the largest coupling is @xmath23 between the central pigments @xmath24 and @xmath25 while their energy difference is about @xmath26 ( remaining values of @xmath22 can be found in the supplemental information ) . as a result , each excitonic eigenstate , which we denote @xmath27 , is highly localized to a particular site @xmath19 .",
    "the table in figure [ fig : table1 ] presents the site energies of the eight chromophores in ascending order as well as the subunits to which each of them is bound .",
    "notice the interesting relationship between the spatial arrangement of the pigments and their energies : the three highest energy chromophores are located in subunit d , the next three highest energy chromophores lie in subunit c and finally the two lowest chromophores reside in subunits b and a. therefore , the hierarchy of pigment energies imposes also a hierarchy of energies among protein subunits . in section [ sec : role ] we illustrate how one of the functions of quantized vibrations is precisely to support efficient energy transfer between protein subunits .",
    "optimal energy transfer in light harvesting systems depends crucially on the transitions and correlations that can arise from interaction between the electronic system and their environment .",
    "the later is usually described as a bath of harmonic modes of frequencies @xmath28 , with boson creation operators @xmath29 and hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "the linear interaction of this harmonic bath and the electronic system is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the coupling of site @xmath19 to mode @xmath33 .",

    "we include the effect of these modes via a spectral density exhibiting sharp components . when combined with the non - markovian polaron treatment ( see [ sec : polaron ] ) , this provides a starting point to investigate the effects of non - equilibrium dynamics associated to these vibrations . in practice",
    ", these modes could be broadened by interactions with the surrounding environment .",
    "therefore , in this work we assume broadened vibrational modes , each with a lorentzian line shape of broadening @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the contribution of each of these modes to the spectral density is given by : @xmath52 a first insight into the relevance of the different components of @xmath53 in excitation dynamics can be gained by understanding the relative position of excitonic transitions to the spectral density .",
    "figure [ fig : spectraldensities ] shows the forms of @xmath54 and @xmath36 as well as superimposed bars indicating the excitonic energy differences of the the electronic hamiltonian ( eq . [ eq : hel ] ) ) .",
    "one striking feature in this figure is that the energies of the vibrations closely match a large number of the excitonic transitions .",
    "for example , the localized mode at @xmath55 lies close to resonance with the transition between eigenstates @xmath56 and @xmath57 and also to the transition between eigenstates @xmath58 and @xmath59 . to understand the physical significance of these resonances ,",
    "consider a scenario where a single localized mode is exactly on resonance with an excitonic transition . in this case , the electronic system is able to emit a phonon into the mode , preserving energy during the transition .",

    "so far however none of these hypothesis has been experimentally probed .",

    "an example is hydrated dna where hole transport is affected by correlated fluctuations that arise from the nearby solvent @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the structure of pe545 is such that a deep pocket of bound water occupies space between the monomers , thus allowing close contact of the pigments with the water molecules .",
    "atomistic calculations to understand whether interaction with near - by solvent can induce correlated fluctuations in pe545 are under development @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we compute linear spectra and dynamics in pe545 with and without solvent - induced correlated fluctuations .",

    "generally , this behaviour is limited to wavelengths on which the environment appears homogeneous , restricting the modes to the low energy sector .",

    "+    [ fig : sitesmode ] [ fig : sitesnomode ]    in this section we highlight the effects of quantized vibrations by systematically comparing dynamics with and without such vibrations as well as comparisons when correlated fluctuations are included .",
    "we shall illustrate how the presence of quantized vibrations is evidenced in transfer times and pathways of energy transport in pe545 and in the beating profile of populations and coherences . before proceeding to the dynamics , however ,",
    "let us first briefly discuss two important aspects regarding the initial state and the basis chosen to describe excitation dynamics .",
    "_ initial state.- _ we consider excitation by an ultrafast laser pulse in a time scale much smaller than the timescale of the solvation dynamics . under these conditions ,",
    "the excitonic system will undergo a vertical franck - condon transition where the vibrational degrees of freedom remains in thermal equilibrium during the fast excitation process .",
    "therefore we may assume that the excitation pulse can excite an excitonic state @xmath27 of the bare hamiltonian ( see eq.([eq : hel ] ) ) .",
    "in this work we assume that the laser pulse is shifted well into the blue end of the spectrum , such that it only excites the highest excitonic eigenstate of the @xmath122 corresponding to a highly localized excitation on @xmath25 .",
    "this initial state is chosen in order to investigate the transfer pathways within the pe545 complex and to allow comparisons with previous works @xcite .",
    "furthermore this situation will let us evaluate whether coherent superpositions of excitonic states are evolved during the dynamics even if they were not present in the initial state .",
    "_ basis of relaxation.- _ it is worth taking a moment to consider the correct basis in which to describe the relaxation dynamics . assuming the single - excitation system relaxes towards a quasi - equilibrium state , a natural basis of relaxation",
    "will be that in which the density matrix becomes diagonal as the steady state is approached . for arbitrary system - bath coupling , such a basis may be constructed in terms of the eigenstates of an effective hamiltonian describing equilibration@xcite . in practice , however , the evaluation of this effective hamiltonian is not a straight forward task and therefore we must choose an approximate basis .",
    "our calculations indicate that the long - time density matrix in the polaron frame is diagonal in the basis of the renormalized hamiltonian eq.([eq : heldressed ] ) .",
    "we therefore choose such a basis to describe relaxation but now in the untransformed frame . in general , these renormalized states depend on the characteristics of system - bath interaction such that it will be different in the absence or presence of correlations . in the absence of solvent - induced correlations",
    ", we find that fluctuations induced by @xmath119 lead to all bath - induced renormalisations @xmath123 evaluating to zero . as a result ,",
    "the master equation eq.[eq : tcl ] becomes a set of non - markovian rate equations describing incoherent excitation transfer between sites . in the presence of spatial correlations corresponding to a speed of sound of @xmath124 , renormalisations are no longer zero and quantum coherent contributions to dynamics can be observed .",
    "the basis of relaxation in this case is a renormalized excitonic basis .",
    "quantized vibrations drastically change the transfer times and pathways for excitation transfer in pe545 . to illustrate this we begin by presenting in figure [ fig : snapshots ] snapshots of the distribution of the excitation in real space at different times in the presence of these vibrations ( figure [ fig : snapmodes ] ) and in their absence ( figure [ fig : snapnomodes ] ) .",
    "the main feature that can be appreciated from these snapshots is that in both situations excitation energy initially localized on @xmath25 is finally distributed to the three lowest lying chromophores @xmath11 , @xmath8 and @xmath125 .",
    "however , the timescale of this process is 5 ps when assisted by quantized vibrations and becomes 10 ps if they are neglected .",
    "importantly , the timescale observed in experiments @xcite is about 5 ps agreeing with our predictions",
    ".    comparison of the snapshots at 0.1 ps indicates that quantized vibrations _",
    "activate transfer _ to its nearest neighbour chromophore @xmath24 ( also the most strongly interacting site ) .",
    "this can also be appreciated in figure [ fig : sitepopulations]a depicting site population dynamics as a function of time .",
    "in contrast , when no quantized vibrations are included , excitation is distributed to the chromophore nearest in energy @xmath14 as can be seen in figure [ fig : sitepopulations]b ) .",
    "one striking feature of the distribution profile at 0.7  ps in figure [ fig : snapmodes ] is that excitation energy has been widely distributed over all the complex , while in the absence of fast vibrations energy is concentrated mainly on protein subunit d. again , results at these intermediate timescales are in good agreement with experimental observations in @xcite .",
    "the features observed in the presence of fast vibrations allow pe545 to perform its biological function : distribution of excitation across the antenna implies that energy can be efficiently transferred to other nearby antennae , and fast transfer to units a and b , which are those probably in contact with psi or psii @xcite , will aid energy conversion .",
    "this is further discussed in section [ sec : role ] .",
    "finally , it is worth nothing that the participation of quantized vibrations in excitation dynamics guarantees that the general timescales of transfer and overall distribution of excitation energy remains practically unchanged as correlated fluctuations are considered ( figure [ fig : sitepopulations]a ) .",
    "this is no longer the case when fast modes are excluded .",
    "in this situation , since transport is mostly driven by thermal fluctuations , a small degree of correlations slows transfer ( figure [ fig : sitepopulations]b ) .",
    "the interplay between correlated fluctuations and quantized vibrations does exhibit interesting features when contributions of each individual mode to site populations are analyzed as shown in the next section .",
    "high - energy vibrations quasi - resonant with excitonic transitions manifest themselves not only in the activation of transport between widely energetically separate states but also in the oscillatory pattern of the dynamics .",
    "this arises primarily from the non - equilibrium dynamics of the vibrational components . to illustrate these features",
    ", we focus now on the population evolution of of the renormalized state @xmath126 , which is mostly localized on the central pigment @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig : distributor](left ) presents the population of @xmath24 when the 14 vibrational modes are included and also when only the modes with frequencies @xmath55 or @xmath127 are present . while @xmath55 is in close resonance with the energy detuning between the initially excited site and the central site , the mode with @xmath127 has the largest coupling to each site .",
    "we find that both modes are able to activate transport in comparison to the situation when no mode is included ( curve labeled ( i ) ) , with a larger rate enhancement achieved with the quasi - resonant mode as expected .",
    "the fourier spectrum of the population dynamics with the full set of 14 modes is somewhat complicated ( not shown ) .",
    "hence we investigate the oscillatory behaviour when only one mode is present ( see ( i ) to ( iii ) in figure [ fig : distributor](left ) ) .",
    "these figures show that the subtle oscillations of these populations are due to the corresponding vibrational modes .",
    "it is important to point out that off - resonance modes such as @xmath127 are able to activate transport to @xmath24 due to the interplay with thermal - induced fluctuations induced by @xmath119 : fluctuations in excitonic energy splittings cause excitonic transitions to be close to an otherwise off - resonance vibration .",
    "equally , fluctuations bring out of resonance transitions which are otherwise quasi - resonant with a fast mode .",
    "the interplay between thermal fluctuations and quantized vibrations bring us to the discussion of the interesting behaviour observed when a small degree of correlated fluctuations is included ( see figure [ fig : distributor](right ) ) . in this case ,",
    "excitonic transitions remain quasi - resonant with a particular mode that fully enhances transport as shown in figure [ fig : distributor](right ) ( curve labeled ( ii ) ) . furthermore , the population dynamics exhibits frequency components of both excitonic and vibrational origin . this can be seen in figures [ fig : distributor](right)(i)-(iii ) which show the fourier spectrum of populations when there is a small degree of solvent - induced correlations . when only the mode with @xmath127 is included the spectrum exhibits three peaks .",
    "one peak at @xmath128 due to the localized vibration assisting transport and a low - amplitude peak at @xmath129 which compares very well with the energy difference between eigensates @xmath130 and @xmath126 .",
    "hence we may attribute this frequency component to a quantum - coherent excitonic oscilation and indicates that , in the basis chosen to describe the dynamics , populations can witness coherences .",
    "the feature at @xmath131 in figures [ fig : distributor](iii)(right ) does not correspond exactly to any transition frequency , therefore we believe that this peak arises from a beating between a frequency of excitonic coherence ( @xmath132 ) and the vibration - induced oscillation of frequency @xmath127 . for comparison , we present the fourier spectrum when no mode is present ( see figures [ fig : distributor](right)(i ) ) and when only the mode @xmath55 is included ( figures [ fig : distributor](ii)(right ) ) .",
    "the small scaling factor of the spectra in figure [ fig : distributor](right)(i ) is consistent with the very small amplitude of the population oscillations observed when vibrational modes are not present .",
    "+   +    as discussed in the previous section , quantum - coherent contributions to dynamics appear when solvent - induced correlated fluctuations are included .",
    "in this situation , bath - induced renormalizations do not vanish and they range between @xmath133 and @xmath134 such that quantum coherent dynamics associated to @xmath77 is at play .",
    "we therefore now investigate how non - equilibrium vibrations manifest themselves in the oscillatory profile of excitonic coherences . for simplicity",

    "these off - diagonal matrix elements correspond to coherences investigated in room - temperature two - dimensional spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "large - amplitude oscillations are observed in the dynamics of both @xmath137 and @xmath138 but they last only for about 50 - 100 fs . on longer timescales ,",
    "there is also a small - amplitude oscillatory component -a hundred times smaller than the oscillations in the short time scale .",
    "to investigate the origin of the two different oscillatory features , we once again calculate their fourier transforms .",
    "the frequency spectrums over the 1  ps timescale are presented in figure [ fig : coherencesft ] .",
    "two features should be noticed .",
    "first , there is a very broad component due to the fast decaying oscillations seen at short times . for the matrix element @xmath139",
    "this broad feature occurs at @xmath140 , which corresponds to the energy difference between eigenstates @xmath130 and @xmath141 .",
    "similarly for @xmath142 this broad features is observed around @xmath143 , which corresponds to the energy difference between eigenstates @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , we may attribute these frequencies to quantum coherent evolution associated to @xmath77 . in contrast , the second feature within the fourier spectra is much subtler and occurs in both cases at roughly @xmath146 .    to investigate the fine structure of the spectrum of long - lived oscillations",
    "we perform the fourier transform only over the time interval @xmath147 to @xmath148 ( figure [ fig : coherencesft2 ] ) .",
    "both off - diagonal elements exhibit a peak at @xmath146 , which can be attributed to vibration - induced oscillations due to the localized mode with @xmath55 .",
    "interestingly , however , the matrix element @xmath138 exhibits an additional peak at @xmath149 , an energy scale comparable to the transition frequency between eigenstates @xmath150 and @xmath126 .",
    "this is an indication of coherence - coherence coupling during the evolution and shows that excitonic coherences are generated during the dynamics even if they were not initially created .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that in the presence of a small degree of correlations supporting coherent evolution of electronic excitations , the beating pattern of excitonic coherences in the presence of vibrations out of equilibrium has a dual origin : short - time oscillations lasting for about 50 - 100 fs reflecting the time scale associated to the electronic hamiltonian and a superimposed vibration - induced modulation that survives close to the picosecond timescale .",
    "importantly , the two timescales identified here compare very well with recent experimental results on a similar complex @xcite .",
    "+     +    the results of the preceding section allow us to clearly point out three key roles of the strong - coupling between highly localized electronic excitations and quantized vibrations in the biological function of pe545 .      in the absence of quantized vibrations",
    "exciton - phonon interactions are dominated by the continuous distribution of modes that induce transitions between states near in energy . given the local nature of excitonic states , transfer dynamics follows the hierarchy of energies of the chromophores . in light of the intimate connection between the hierarchy of energies and the physical arrangement of the pigments in the protein subunits ( figure [ fig : table1 ] ) , we conclude that when quantized vibrations are neglected , electronic excitation moves through pe545 in a sequential manner , from d onto subunit c and finally to subunits b and a as shown in figure [ fig : cascaded ] .",
    "clearly this would be a very unfavourable dynamics for the biological function of transferring energy to other antennae .",
    "in contrast , quantized vibrations take advantage of electronic interactions to promote non - sequential transfer by bridging the energy gap between subunits d and c and spreading out energy from each of them to a and b as shown in figure [ fig : noncascaded ] . in short , _ quantized vibrations in close resonance with excitonic transitions provide a built - in mechanism to control energy transfer pathways_. in general , explotation of environment and system resonances is an important design principle for directing energy transfer @xcite .",
    "high - energy vibrations in pe545 guarantee an effective distribution of energy throughout the complex towards the acceptor states .",
    "the activation of energy transport between @xmath25 and @xmath24 generates both wider spatial spread of excitation to allow transfer between antennae and also faster transfer to the final acceptor states ( localized on @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath11 ) to guarantee energy conversion if an pe545 antennae is in close proximity to complexes like the psii or psi .",
    "quantitative support of the above statement is shown in figure [ fig : temporalspatialdistribution ] which summarizes the dual role of the quantized vibrations in promoting _ faster transfer and wider spatial distribution of excitation energy_. the total population of all the acceptor states is depicted in figure [ fig : temporaldistribution ] and clearly shows a significant enhancement of the transfer rate in the presence of promoting vibrations . to quantify the spatial spreading of excitation energy in pe545 complex we compute the variance @xmath153 in the spatial position of the excitation defined as follows : @xmath154 where @xmath155 denotes the population on chromophore @xmath19 at a given time @xmath156",
    ", @xmath62 is the position vector of chromophore @xmath19 and @xmath157 is the mean position of the excitation .",
    "the dynamics of this measure of spreading is shown figure [ fig : spatialdistribution ] . using generalized frster theory ( details of which",
    "are not presented here ) we have estimated that transfer times between adjacent pe545 complexes is of the order of 0.7 to 1 ps . in this biological timescale ,",
    "quantized vibrations guarantee efficient inter - complex transfer by promoting a wider distribution of excitation energy ( dotted vertical line in figure [ fig : spatialdistribution ] ) and faster transfer to acceptor states ( see dotted vertical line figure [ fig : temporaldistribution ] ) .",
    "these conclusions also hold when a small degree of correlated fluctuations is included as shown in insets of figures [ fig : temporaldistribution ] and [ fig : spatialdistribution ] .",
    "we have discussed how a small degree of correlated fluctuations supports quantum - coherent dynamics of excitonic states and ensures tuning of a resonance with a preferred vibrational mode that enhances energy transport to a targeted site in the complex . for clarity",
    "this is summarized in figure[fig : activation ] showing the enhancement of the population of the central pigment @xmath24 when coherent dynamics ( correlations ) is turned on and only the mode @xmath158 is considered .",
    "these results lead us to argue , that _ in the presence of quantized vibrations , any mechanism supporting coherent evolution of excitonic states , will also ensure that resonances enhancing transport are activated_. the rationale behind this idea is simple : coherent evolution effectively implies that excitonic gaps during dynamics do not fluctuate much and hence frequencies associated to coherent evolution can be synchronized with quasi - resonant vibrations for longer times , which in turn enhances population transport .    to illustrate this idea further , we consider now the situation where quantum - coherent mixing of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom is allowed , which generates _ room - temperature _ coherent evolution of excitonic states .",
    "to show this we consider the full hamiltonian evolution of an enlarged system that inlcudes both electronic states and quantized vibrations .",
    "for simplicity we consider a simplified model consisting of the central dimer formed by @xmath159 and @xmath160 with each pigment coupled to only one mode of frequency @xmath158 . as mentioned before , this mode is in close resonance with the energy difference between the two excitonic states of the dimer which we denote x and y. to capture the effects of the external thermal background we consider each site to be subject to a small amount of pure dephasing .",
    "details of this simplified model are presented in appendix [ sec : a2 ] .",
    "the initial state of the dimer - plus - modes system is separable , with the electronic part in the highest energy exciton state x ( and hence no initial exciton coherence ) and the high - frequency modes in thermal equilibrium . in this way , if no modes are present , there is no transport .",
    "in this situation we see that coherent exciton - mode interactions : ( i ) activate population transport to the low - lying excitonic state y and ( ii ) create and modulate long - lived ( picosecond ) excitonic coherences ( figure [ fig : toymodel ] ) .",
    "creation of excitonic coherences is , of course , expected as the initial state is not an eigenstate of the full dimer - plus - modes system .",
    "notice that our calculations are at _ room - temperature _ where the thermal population of the mode is mostly limited to the lowest number states , hence the importance of its quantum behavior .",
    "the full advantages of quantum features of high - energy modes in transport processes will be soon presented in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "a recent work @xcite has also considered modulation of excitonic coherences in the fenna - matthews - olson complex due a vibration whose energy is comparable to the thermal energy scale ( @xmath161 )",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the differences that can arise in exciton coherence dynamics and non - equilibrium transport properties depending of the energy scale of the vibration involved .",
    "the role of vibrations for adjusting and enhancing transport in wide variety of biological and chemical systems is currently of central interest @xcite . in this article",
    "we have illustrated the importance of quantized vibrations for efficient energy transport in photosynthetic systems where excitonic states are highly localized such as the pe545 antennae protein present in cryptophyte algae .",
    "the main feature allowing these systems to take full advantage of fast vibrations is the near - resonance between vibrational frequencies and the energy gaps between excitonic states .",
    "an important implication of this close energy match is that quantum - coherent evolutions can then tune the resonances and direct excitation energy in a preferential manner .",
    "therefore , we argue that _ in photosynthetic complexes where transport is vibration - activated , a fundamental biological function for quantum coherent contributions to dynamics is to support resonances that promote fast and effective energy distribution_.    the non - markovian master equation in the polaron framework captures some important effects of the non - equilibrium dynamics associated to the vibrations of interest such as long - time modulation of the excitonic coherences at room temperature , predicting time scales in good agreement with those reported in experiments . however , a full quantum treatment of the interactions between excitons and these quasi - resonant vibrations is needed both to assert the accuracy of the results here presented and to have a more complete picture of the rage of non - equilibrium effects in different chryptophyte antennae .",
    "we are currently pursuing such study and our preliminary results confirm the features presented in this article and indicate that rich nonclassical and non - equilibrium behavior arise in these systems @xcite .",
    "atomistic calculations identifying the structural origin of such vibrations are therefore crucial . from the experimental view point",
    "it is important to develop more direct measurements of the influence of such vibrations in channelling and/or enhancing excitation energy transfer @xcite as well as conclusive signatures of their quantum properties in conditions of biological relevance .",
    "the integration of physical descriptions as the ones presented in this article , together with atomistic calculations and experimental characterization will provide useful insights for the design of antennae prototypes that exploit electronic interactions and promoting vibrations for controlled and enhanced performance .    we thank benedetta mennucci , rienk van grondelle , elisabet romero , ulrich kleinekathoefer and carles curuchet for discussions .",

    "s. thanks the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , and darpa ( qube ) for support .",
    "in this appendix , we derive an expression for the dipole correlation function within the polaron formalism used in section [ sec : polaron ] the dipole - dipole correlation function is defined as    @xmath99    where @xmath162 and the system dipole operator @xmath101 is defined as the sum of the dipole operators for the individual chromophores as follows :    @xmath163",
    "let us now transform into the polaron frame defined by the transformation @xmath164 , where @xmath72 , with @xmath73 . within the polaron frame ,",
    "the dipole - dipole correlation function becomes :    @xmath165    while the dipole operator in the polaron frame is given by :    @xmath166    where @xmath167 is the bath displacement operator of mode @xmath33 due to interaction with site @xmath168 .",
    "let us now proceed to calculate the dipole - dipole correlation function in steps .",
    "firstly consider :    @xmath169    then the dipole - dipole correlation function is :    @xmath170    at this point , we make a number of approximations to simplify the expression for the dipole - dipole correlation function .",
    "firstly , we shall assume that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath171 does not perturb the bath .",
    "this amounts to assuming that the bath is in the stationary , thermal state within the polaron frame ( @xmath172 ) at all times . under this assumption",
    "we may write    @xmath173    the second assumption we shall make is that all system coherence terms decouple . this amounts to making the secular approximation for the system dynamics .",
    "therefore , we may write :    @xmath174    under these assumptions , the dipole - dipole correlation function has the following very simple form :    @xmath175    where we have defined the dressed bath correlation function @xmath109 as    @xmath176    to complete the calculation of the linear spectra we need to know how each of the off - diagonal element @xmath177 evolves with time .",
    "to do so , let us consider the markovian secular polaron master equation in the interaction picture :      details of this master equation can be found in kolli _",
    "the equation of motion for the off - diagonal element @xmath177 is then given by :    @xmath179    the general solution for the evolution of the coherence terms , in the schrdinger picture , is then simply given by @xmath180 , where have defined the total dephasing rate as @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the final expression for the dipole - dipole correlation function becomes :    @xmath182",
    "this model considers the central dimer in pe545 formed by pigments @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "the excitonic hamiltonian is given by @xmath183 where the strength of the electronic interaction is @xmath184 and the exciton eigenstates are labeled x and y. each pigment is coupled to a localized mode with frequency @xmath185 .",
    "the free hamiltonian for the modes is @xmath186 while their linear interaction with the dipole - coupled dimer is given by @xmath187 . here",
    "the strength of the site - mode coupling is @xmath188 .",
    "the initial state of the full dimer plus modes system @xmath189 is propagated under the total hamiltonian @xmath190 .",
    "the initial state of the dimer is chosen to be the highest energy eigenstate x such that in the absence of the harmonic modes no transport occurs .",
    "the modes are assumed to be initially in thermal equilibrium at room temperature ( 300k ) .",
    "for the purposes of calculations , the fock space of the modes is truncated to a maximum occupation @xmath191 which fully captures the dynamics of the high - energy modes for the parameters considered . we also introduce pure dephasing of onsite energies which results in a dissipator of the form @xmath192 with @xmath193 .",
