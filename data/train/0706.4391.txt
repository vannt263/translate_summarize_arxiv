    "the appearance of finite connectivity trees ( _ eg _ cayley trees , bethe lattices ) in the study of spin glasses has a long history that goes back to the first papers on the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite .",
    "thouless , anderson and palmer@xcite showed by means of a diagrammatic expansion of the partition function that in the spin - glass phase the mean - field theory is defined by the diagrams which describe an infinite tree with connectivity @xmath2 .",
    "they then wrote the mean field equationsfor such a tree and simplified the results in the small coupling , large connectivity regime ( since in the sk model @xmath3 and the couplings @xmath4 ) .",
    "those mean field equations are known as the tap equations and the peculiar characteristics of their solutions , in particular their large number @xcite , were an important indicator of the complexity of the spin glass phase that arose in parallel with the remarkable developments in the study of the replicated free energy @xcite .",
    "many authors have since studied the problem of a spin glass on the bethe lattice @xcite with two distinct motivations .",
    "the first of these has been to attempt to find a model of a short ranged spin glass where one can rigorously assess parisi s picture for the organization of the gibbs states in short - range systems @xcite .",
    "the second has come from computer science whereby a set of optimization problems can be recast as frustrated problems on random graphs with the local connectivity of a tree @xcite .    despite much work ,",
    "the bethe lattice has not yielded a decisive verdict for or against the parisi picture of a multitude of gibbs states in the ordered phase of a spin glass although the case for it is perhaps stronger here than on regular lattices with short ranged interactions .",
    "this is tied up with the question of defining the infinite bethe lattice limit starting from finite graphs .",
    "it is possible to do so either via a sequence of cayley trees with random , frustrating , boundary conditions or via a sequence of random graphs with fixed connectivity .",
    "the latter sequence has frustrating loops of typical size diverging @xmath5 for a graph with @xmath6 points and connectivity @xmath7 and thus locally looks like a tree @xcite .",
    "the cayley tree sequence can always be analyzed in terms of a recursion relation that we review below and does not appear to lead to the parisi structure @xcite .",
    "however , it has been argued that the random graph problem is fundamentally different and _ does _ lead to replica symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "happily , the perspective provided by spin glass theory on optimization problems has been quite fruitful regardless .",
    "starting in the early 80 s @xcite , it became clear that much was gained by the recognition that various optimization problems in computer science were equivalent to finding ground states of certain statistical mechanics problems .",
    "a typical example of this connection is given by the k - sat problem , which asks `` given a boolean expression @xmath8 on @xmath6 bits @xmath9 composed of the conjunction of @xmath10 clauses , each of which involves exactly @xmath11 of the bits , is it satisfiable by some bit assignment ? ''",
    "this can be recast in hamiltonian form by writing a cost function @xmath12 $ ] that evaluates the number of violated clauses .",
    "in this language , the bits naturally become ising spins , the expression @xmath8 becomes a particular instance of some spin glass and the original question requires determining the ground state energy .",
    "the large @xmath6 limit is a problem in statistical mechanics and typical - case analysis for k - sat becomes the disorder averaged analysis of spin glass theory . in this limit , @xmath11-sat develops several phase transitions as a function of @xmath13 , the number of clauses per bit@xcite . with increasing @xmath14 ,",
    "the most salient features are that the problem goes from being easily solved and satisfiable , to an intermediate glassy phase with many local ground states , to a typically unsatisfiable phase where the ground state energy density is positive .",
    "a key role in these developments has been played by the so called _ cavity method_a complex of analytical and numerical techniques refined recently @xcite  for studying classical spin glasses on tree - like graphs .",
    "applied to the k - sat problem , the cavity method suggests the above phase diagram and provides numerical values for its critical points .",
    "moreover , the technique can be applied to a particular instance of k - sat and the information so obtained about the free energy landscape now guides the search procedure in state - of - the - art k - sat algorithms @xcite .",
    "in this paper we turn to _ quantum _ spin glasses on bethe lattices , specifically to the problem of extending the cavity method to their analysis . as in the classical case , there are two distinct reasons to be interested in these systems . there is the intrinsic interest of the interplay between quantum mechanics and spin glass behavior , about which the difficulties of the classical case serve as both caution and enticement .",
    "a second motivation now arises from the rapid recent developments in quantum computing .",
    "in particular , the discovery of the ground state of a classical spin system @xmath15 derived from a computational problem is ideally suited to solution by the _ adiabatic algorithm _",
    "@xcite , which allows a quantum computer to solve such a problem by means of an adiabatic change of the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "the adiabatic algorithm would trace a path in operator space starting from a simpler hamiltonian @xmath16 and ending at @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , @xmath16 could be the hamiltonian for @xmath6 independent spins in a large transverse magnetic field @xmath17 and the path could be to slowly lower the field and raise the ising couplings @xmath8 .",
    "starting from the easily found ground state of @xmath16 a sufficiently slow evolution will carry the system to the ground state of @xmath15 .",
    "the power of this algorithm is therefore measured in the scaling of the evolution time with the number of variables @xmath6 .",
    "this discussion certainly suggests that a careful study of the phase transitions encountered on the path between @xmath16 and @xmath15 is in order .",
    "however , the necessity of understanding the `` deep '' quantum spin glass phase far from the phase transition is also clear .",
    "the structure of this phase , especially its nontrivial energy landscape , is probably as important as the nature of the phase transition . in this paper",
    "we take a first step toward understanding the quantum spin glass phase by generalizing the cavity method used to study the classical problem .",
    "compared to the replica method or direct study of the quantum tap equations , we believe the cavity method outlined in this paper provides much more physically transparent information about the sg phase .",
    "it also may be applied to many other quantum phase transitions on the bethe lattice , whether induced by disorder or more typical symmetry breaking .",
    "we note that the topic of quantum spin glasses on trees has been tackled before in the literature from the point of view of statistical mechanics @xcite and computation theory @xcite .",
    "however , in order to proceed analytically and due to the complexity of the problem , these works have employed several uncontrolled approximations .",
    "we will compare with them briefly in the core of the paper . while we have used approximations in our ( numerical ) analysis as well , we believe they are better controlled , since we show how to systematically improve them and how the results are robust with respect to the improvements .",
    "more evolved computational methods for tackling very similar problems have appeared in the literature on dynamical mean field theory @xcite and could possibly be applied to the quantum cavity method on glasses .",
    "these methods may allow a study of the zero temperature case , which our approximations could not capture .",
    "let us turn now to a very brief overview of the results in this paper .",
    "we first formulate the cavity method for the transverse ising spin glass on a bethe lattice .",
    "this is a markov process for the on - site effective action whose stationary probability distribution can be found numerically using a population dynamics algorithm .",
    "this will be the main result of the paper . in this way we obtain the phase boundary in the @xmath18 plane , the values of the usual thermodynamic quantities ( free energy , energy , entropy and @xmath19 , the edward - anderson order parameter @xcite ) and more typical ` quantum ' quantities like the single spin von neumann entropy .",
    "indeed , from the fixed point probability distributions for the effective actions we can calculate distributions for all of the statistical properties of the system .",
    "this leaves much room for further work .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : we introduce the classical cavity method for uniform ferromagnetic systems and spin glasses in section [ sec : classcav ] ; we propose its generalization to the quantum spin glass problem in [ sec : quancav ] ; we apply it to the numerical study of a bethe lattice with connectivity three in [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "discussion and directions for further work will be presented in the last sections .",
    "the cavity method is a way of finding the spin glass free energy by means of self - consistency equations for the probability distributions of quantities characterizing the statistics of the spins ( the _ cavity fields _ ) .",
    "it has several virtues compared with the replica method , in particular if applied to spin glasses with finite connectivity .",
    "we will return to them after we have explained how the cavity method works .      for conceptual clarity we will first recall the `` cavity method '' in its simplest form as applied to a ferromagnetic ising model living on a bethe lattice with connectivity @xmath7 . as mentioned above",
    ", there is considerable subtlety in defining a sensible infinite tree model , but for this simple case , a sequence of cayley trees with uniform small boundary fields to break the ising symmetry will suffice . in any event , we shall focus here on the local structure of the model .",
    "the classical hamiltonian is @xmath20 where @xmath21 are ising spins , @xmath22 is a uniform ferromagnetic coupling and the sum is over bonds in the bethe lattice . to create a _ cavity _ , we pick a spin @xmath23 in the bethe lattice and imagine removing it : @xmath24 each of @xmath23 s neighbors is a cavity spin , connected to @xmath25 spins and sitting at the root of a branch of the original tree . notice that in the absence of @xmath23 these @xmath7 branches are entirely independent .",
    "similarly , a cavity spin @xmath26 mediates the only interaction between the @xmath25 branches sitting above it .",
    "we can define three important operations we can perform on graphs with cavity spins : _ iteration _",
    ", _ merging _ , and _",
    "link addition _",
    "[ fig : cavity - ops ] . ) for our immediate purposes , the most important of these is iteration , which takes @xmath25 rooted branches of depth @xmath27 and links them into a single new branch of depth @xmath28 with a new cavity spin at the root .",
    "thus we can construct an arbitrarily large cayley tree by iterating inward from its boundary spins many times followed by a final merge operation to form the center .    , @xmath29 , etc ... ]",
    "consider the iteration operation : the added spin @xmath23 receives thermodynamic information regarding each of the @xmath25 branches only through the thermal distribution of the cavity spins @xmath30 . in the absence of @xmath23 , each of these ising variables has independent statistics characterized fully by its thermal probability distribution : @xmath31 which defines the _ cavity field _ @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath33 , there are only two possible configurations of the spin and only @xmath34 real numbers are needed to characterize the probability distribution . in this sense , the cavity field @xmath32 is merely a good parameterization of the distribution @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasize this viewpoint because it will naturally generalize to the quantum case .",
    "we introduce a simple graphical convention for cavity spins : @xmath36 the open circle indicates a spin variable and the wiggly line indicates the effective field attached to it . with this notation ,",
    "an iteration operation can be represented : @xmath37 where the filled circle indicates summing out a spin variable .",
    "more formally , the state of the spin @xmath23 depends on the state of the @xmath25 spins as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a normalization factor so @xmath40 . in terms of cavity fields this equation implies @xmath41    finally , to solve the ferromagnet",
    ", we note that all the @xmath42 and apply uniform boundary fields ( say slightly positive ) to the cayley tree `` leaves '' . from this uniform starting point",
    ", we expect to find fixed points for the cavity fields under iteration given by @xmath43 this is precisely the bethe - peierls self - consistency equation for a mean field ferromagnetic in a lattice of coordination number @xmath7 .",
    "the careful reader will have noticed that until eq .",
    "( [ eq : bethepeierls ] ) , we did not anywhere exploit the uniformity of @xmath44 or @xmath32 in the foregoing discussion .",
    "with this foundation laid , we can make short work of the classical bethe lattice ising spin glass .",
    "again , we consider a bethe lattice defined as a limit of cayley trees with fixed boundary conditions rather than as a limit of random graphs .",
    "the hamiltonian is now @xmath45 where the @xmath44 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables drawn from some distribution @xmath46 . for simplicity and because of its connection to computational problems",
    ", we will restrict our attention to the @xmath1 model @xmath47 although much of the discussion has broader validity .",
    "the iteration equation ( [ eq : consistencypsi ] ) is still valid for particular realizations of the @xmath8 , but since these are random variables , it now defines a markov process for the cavity fields . throughout the graph",
    ", these fields will be site dependent random variables , but _",
    "deep inside the tree _ , they ought to be distributed according to a probability distribution @xmath48 that represents a fixed point of the markov process .",
    "this fixed point distribution will satisfy @xmath49 in terms of the spin distribution , this becomes the functional equation @xmath50 = \\int \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{q-1 } d\\psi_i p[\\psi_i ] \\right )   { \\left",
    "<   \\delta [ \\psi(\\sigma ) - \\psi_0(\\sigma ; \\set{\\psi_i},\\set{j_{0i } } ) ] \\right>}_j\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : consistencypsi ] ) .",
    "this distribution is the order parameter for the spin glass .",
    "it is a @xmath52 function at @xmath53 in the high temperature phase .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , @xmath48 broadens to have finite support below some mean field - like phase transition . defining @xmath54 ,",
    "this phase transition is located at @xmath55 .",
    "it is possible to write the free energy per site in terms of @xmath48 as @xmath56 this rather complicated looking expression is actually simply the average change in free energy due to a merge operation minus @xmath57 times the average change in free energy due to a link addition .",
    "graphically , @xmath58 where @xmath59 of a diagram is the free energy of a system with spin variables given by the unfilled circles .",
    "it is possible to see that if @xmath60 satisfies ( [ eq : consp ] ) then @xmath61 .",
    "other expressions for the free energy @xmath62 have appeared in the literature but it has been shown that they are all equivalent to each other , if the consistency equation ( [ eq : consp ] ) is verified . the role of the free energy in the cavity method is secondary as one does not solve the variational problem , as in the replica method , by working on the free energy directly .",
    "rather , one finds the probability distribution @xmath60 by analytical or numerical methods and then derives all of the statistical observables from @xmath60 .",
    "is necessary @xcite . ]",
    "the equivalence of the two formulations has been put forward in ref . and in many other works .",
    "we have up to this point assumed that the underlying lattice is in fact a tree and that the removal of a spin to create a cavity completely decouples the neighboring branches . on such models , the cavity method we have described is exact .",
    "an important generalization of the cavity method arises in its heuristic application to locally tree-_like _ random graphs where the typical loop size diverges logarithmically and any finite neighborhood is a simple tree . in this case",
    "however , the decoupling of cavity spins is not exact and it is necessary to introduce the so - called `` replica symmetry breaking '' ansatz on the structure of thermodynamic states in order to correctly describe the frozen ( glassy ) phase .",
    "although this is a vital component of the modern understanding of such glasses , we have not included it in our quantum treatment below because we believe their is still much to be understood about the quantum model on the much simpler trees .",
    "we refer the interested reader to ref .   for a more detailed description of replica symmetry breaking in the classical cavity method .",
    "now , having introduced the cavity method in classical statistical mechanics we go on to generalize it to quantum mechanics .",
    "we consider the modification of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : classham ] ) due to the introduction of a transverse magnetic field @xmath63 this is called the _ transverse field ising spin glass _ in the literature .",
    "the ising variables of the previous section have been replaced by pauli matrices @xmath64 and the magnetic field couples to the matrices @xmath65 .",
    "the fact that @xmath64 and @xmath65 do not commute gives rise to a host of interesting new features due to the interplay of quantum mechanics and disorder @xcite .",
    "the usual suzuki - trotter decomposition allows us to rewrite the problem in terms of @xmath66 ising spins per quantum spin , where the number @xmath66 needs to be sent to infinity eventually .",
    "the additional dimension which is introduced in this way is the usual imaginary time .",
    "the @xmath67 interactions are time - translation invariant ( the disorder is correlated in the time direction ) while the @xmath65 terms give a ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interaction in the time direction . before writing the hamiltonian",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "for any finite @xmath66 we will refer to the ising spin configuration at a given site @xmath68 as a `` rod '' of spins .",
    "the rod at site @xmath68 is described by @xmath66 spins @xmath69 where @xmath70 takes values from @xmath71 to @xmath72 in steps of @xmath73 , with periodic boundary conditions @xmath74 .",
    "this notation is convenient if the limit @xmath75 is eventually performed , since the rod is represented by a function @xmath76\\to\\{-1,1\\}$ ] with @xmath77 .",
    "the rod statistics are described by a probability distribution @xmath78 $ ] , a functional of @xmath79 , that gives a positive real number for every configuration @xmath79 .",
    "the normalization condition reads @xmath80=1 $ ] .",
    "the partition function is written as @xmath81}\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian is : @xmath82 we can also write this as a sum over links of the energy of a link : @xmath83 where a fraction @xmath84 of the imaginary - time interaction is associated to each link ( there are @xmath7 links per spin ) . here",
    "@xmath85 .",
    "notice that @xmath86 so the system is ferromagnetic , and moreover when @xmath87 then @xmath88 and the coupling along the time direction is strongly ferromagnetic .",
    "in particular , for @xmath89 the spins in any given rod are locked together as @xmath66 useless copies of a single ising spin .",
    "thus , the results reduce to the classical case smoothly .    the spatial tree - like structure of the original problem is reflected in the tree - like structure of the interaction between rods .",
    "we can therefore imagine an iteration process with rods replacing the spins , in which we have @xmath25 _ cavity rods _",
    "$ ] which are merged and determine the state of the rod @xmath91 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tree - iteration ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to a recursion relation for the calculation of the partition function of the branches , analogous to the classical equation ( [ eq : consistencypsi ] ) : @xmath92=\\frac{1}{z}\\sum_{\\{\\sigma_{i\\geq 1}(t)\\ } } e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^{q-1}\\beta h_{0i}}\\prod_{i=1}^{q-1}\\psi_i[\\sigma_i(t)].\\ ] ]        just as in the classical case , this iteration equation is already enough to solve an interesting ferromagnetic problem .",
    "consider the case @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "for @xmath93 our bethe lattice is a simple chain of spins , moreover all @xmath8 s being equal we can take @xmath95 without loss of generality .",
    "we then recover the well known ferromagnetic ising _ chain _ with a transverse field , an exactly solvable system .",
    "one way to solve it is to use onsager s transfer matrix method .",
    "in fact , the iteration equation ( [ eq : recrod ] ) can be rewritten as just such a transfer matrix equation where @xmath96 is the @xmath97 dimensional vector and @xmath98 the transfer matrix @xmath99 : @xmath100 the fixed point of this iteration gives the eigenvector @xmath96 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue @xmath39 . in the limit @xmath75 , this is an exact solution which contains all the information about classical and quantum phase transitions .    returning to the case of the spin glass , we can write down the quantum cavity fixed point equation analogous to the classical equation ( [ eq : consp ] ) immediately : @xmath101 \\right ] & = & { \\left < \\delta\\left [ \\psi[\\sigma(t ) ] - \\psi_0[\\sigma(t ) ; \\{j_{0i } , \\psi_i \\}_{i=1}^{q-1 } ] \\right ]   \\right>}_{j_{0i } , \\psi_i } \\vspace{1em } \\\\   & = & \\int \\left ( \\prod_{i=1}^{q-1 } d\\psi_i p_{fp}\\left [ \\psi_i \\right ] dj_{0i } p(j_{0i } ) \\right )           \\delta\\left [ \\psi[\\sigma(t ) ] - \\psi_0[\\sigma(t ) ; \\{j_{0i } , \\psi_i \\}_{i=1}^{q-1 } ] \\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the iterated rod action @xmath102 $ ] is given by eq .",

    "it is exact but difficult to solve in closed form .",
    "it is certainly possible that analytic progress can be made , but we have not succeeded thus far .",
    "however , it is amenable to numerical study at finite @xmath66 under certain approximations and also perhaps by continuous time monte carlo for @xmath75 . in the remainder of this section",
    "we will explore the finite @xmath66 approach .",
    "we must first parameterize our generic vector @xmath96 in the @xmath105-dimensional space of the configurations of the rods . in principle",

    "the statistics generated by this markov process and in particular its fixed point distribution @xmath119 are the solution of the problem .        by parameterizing the quantum dynamics through the action expansion ( [ eq : expans ] ) we do not make any _ a priori _ assumptions about the nature of the spin - spin correlations in the time direction ",
    "that is , if we could keep all of the terms in the expansion , it would be an exact treatment .",
    "we avoid in this way the spherical approximation which has been used in ref .  , since the results thus obtained do not reduce to the well - known classical results for @xmath89 .    in practice , however , we truncate the cavity actions to second order .",
    "most usefully , this corresponds to the leading order term in a large connectivity expansion of the effective action .",
    "indeed , in a large @xmath7 treatment , in which the couplings @xmath44 must be scaled as @xmath120 for the disordered model , one finds that the one- and two - body terms in the effective action for the rod at the root of a tree are @xmath121 , the three- and four - body terms are @xmath122 and so on@xcite .",
    "the truncation to second order is thus both exact and necessary in the @xmath123 limit .",
    "we note that the oft - used _ _",
    "static approximation__@xcite is thus incorrect even at infinite connectivity for disordered models .",
    "the truncation to second order is also exact at high temperature , regardless of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "numerical investigations of small systems suggest that the higher order interactions are quantitatively small more generally , even at @xmath0 .",
    "this is especially true at small @xmath17 , where the strong ferromagnetism in the time - like nearest neighbor bonds dominates .",
    "we note that there is also some error in the numerical fitting of an iterated cavity distribution to a truncated action .",
    "this problem is reminiscent of a _ maximum entropy _ model for the statistics of signals and the _ inverse ising problem _ of computer science @xcite . however , even in the disordered system , the interaction of the spins along imaginary time is always ferromagnetic and the problem does not present the difficulties that usually accompany the inverse problems in general statistical mechanics . in other words , although the original problem is fundamentally frustrated , none of this frustration appears in the single spin dynamics .",
    "the frustration is taken care of in the treatment of the relevant parameters @xmath124 as random numbers .    for comparison",
    ", we note that our approach is closely related to self - consistent dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) methods , which also truncate to non - local two point interactions in the single - spin effective action ( these are the so - called weiss functions or bare green s functions of dmft treatments ) .",
    "however , dmft techniques can not be used straightforwardly for disordered systems .",
    "one can not assume that the imaginary - time propagator ( or action ) for a spin is equal to that of the spins which surround it but rather that they come from the same probability distribution .",
    "if this observation is taken into account then we expect to recover functional equations for the distribution of single site green s functions analogous to those we have proposed for the single site action .      finally , we comment on where in the @xmath125 phase diagram the fixed @xmath66 approach will give reliable results . as mentioned above , on the classical line @xmath126 , all spins in a rod",
    "are locked together by divergent nearest neighbor interactions and the trotter decomposed system ( for _ any _ @xmath66 ) reduces to the classical system exactly . in the opposite limit of large @xmath17 at fixed @xmath66 ,",
    "the planes of the trotter system decouple as @xmath127 .",
    "each of these planes is an exact copy of the original @xmath126 spin glass model except with couplings @xmath128",
    ". these will therefore undergo independent thermal phase transitions at @xmath129 and no @xmath130 critical field will be detected .",
    "this explains the phenomenon of `` asymptotic critical lines '' that we note in our finite @xmath66 phase diagrams .    more generally , for the finite @xmath66 approximation to be valid , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the typical number of kinks in a rod .",
    "for a single spin in a transverse field , a straightforward calculation shows @xmath133 , which for large @xmath134 reduces to @xmath135 . within the paramagnetic phase this calculation remains nearly exact ,",
    "although in the spin glass phase @xmath136 will be suppressed by the presence of longitudinal cavity fields . however , this inequality @xmath137 remains a good indicator of the quality of the approximation and agrees with the regions where it clearly breaks down .",
    "thus , this expansion is particularly useful close to line @xmath89 , and we will see that it gives reasonable results and insights into the structure of the problem also deep in the quantum spin glass phase . on the other hand , the other region of interest @xmath138 should not be addressed with this expansion , unless the description of the spins in terms of continuous time functions @xmath79 turns out to be treatable in the future . in this paper",
    ", we will not be able to make definitive statements about the nature of the quantum phase transition which occurs at this point but we are definitely able to make statements about the nature of the _ spin glass phase _ when quantum effects are not negligible .    in the next section",
    "we show how a simple minded trotter discretization with @xmath66 relatively small ( @xmath139 to @xmath140 ) delivers a great deal of information about the quantum spin glass phase .",
    "we solve the fixed point equation ( [ eq : rsfixedpoint ] ) numerically using a population dynamics algorithm analogous to that of mezard and parisi@xcite .",
