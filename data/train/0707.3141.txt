    "one potential caveat regarding the lower lying ( e.g. j=1 - 0 ) transitions is that the low density molecular gas in 6 quasars may be in a diffuse intracloud medium as is thought to be the case for local ulirgs , rather than bound in gmcs ( downes & solomon 1998 ) . in our subgrid modeling of gmcs , we assume implicitly that the diffuse molecular gas is bound in the outer envelopes of gmcs which are characterized as singular isothermal spheres .",

    ", walter & scoville ( 2005b ) found the co sed to peak at j=6 in the nuclear region of starburst galaxy m82 .    as energy input from the quasar begins to quench the starburst and dispel gas from the central regions , the star formation rate drops to @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the peak excitation in the molecular gas rapidly drops to values more similar to local starbursts . during most of the quasar phase , the co flux density in the simulated galaxy peaks at j=6",

    "the peak of the co flux density remains roughly constant through the height of the quasar phase .",

    "the bulk of the molecular gas in this late stage of the galaxy s evolution is only moderately excited , and the peak in the co sed declines to j@xmath633 - 4 .",
    "the trends discussed above are similar in models q2 and q3 ( table  [ table : ics ] ) , though the overall normalization is slightly different .",
    "the co sed of both the intermediate mass and low mass models ( q2 and q3 ) peaks at j=6 at the beginning of the quasar phase , and settles at j=4 as the starburst subsides .",
    "the lower excitation values in the lowest mass model owe to overall lower densities and star formation rates .",
    "for example , during the quasar phase , the sfr from model q3 is @xmath64 .",
    "another way to view the excitation characteristics of the molecular gas is through the velocity - integrated co luminosity ( in units of k- , where the k is the rayleigh - jeans temperature ) . in figure  [",

    "this is especially true of the high - j states which are typically excited by collisions in the starburst - heated gas .",
    "all co transitions peak in integrated intensity early on , when the starburst has not consumed most of the available star - forming gas , and collisions help to sustain molecular excitation . as the starburst fades owing to a diminishing fuel supply , the intensity from the high lying co transitions ( e.g. 6 - 5 , 9 - 8 ) falls off rapidly while the lower - j transitions experience a more moderate decline . in part",
    ", this owes to the fact that the lowering of gas temperatures and densities does not heavily affect the molecular excitation at j=1 .",
    "de - excitation of warm , dense star forming gas additionally contributes to populating the lower j states .",

    "owing to the violent nature of the quasar s formation process , the spatial extent of the co emission has a large dynamic range , and varies from @xmath66 kpc to @xmath67 pc ( half - light radius ) throughout the evolution of the host galaxy .",

    "[ figure : snap8specrandom ] , we show a sample 3 random co ( j=6 - 5 ) emission lines from the simulated quasars q1 , q2 and q3 at the peak of their respective quasar phases .",
    "the first noteworthy point regarding the co emission lines from the 6 quasar models is that they are characteristically featured , with a significant amount of substructure . along many lines of sight , several smaller emission spikes ( with @xmath69 ) originating in dense co clumps in the central 2 kpc sit superposed on the broader emission line .",
    "these emitting clumps are centrally concentrated in the quasar , and similar emission features are seen in higher spatial resolution spectra .    another clear feature of figure  [ figure : snap8specrandom ] is the apparent trend of narrowing line width with decreasing halo circular velocity .",

    "we additionally show the range of sightline - dependent observed line width values .",
    "the multiple mergers involved in the formation of the simulated 6 quasars give rise to large velocity dispersions along a number of sightlines during the buildup of the quasar host galaxies . during this time , much of the molecular gas is not virialized , and thus the typical line widths exhibited represent about twice the expected circular velocity at the spatial extents of the molecular gas . in the quasar phase ,",
    "as the gas virializes into a molecular disk , the co line widths drop to values more consistent with the virial velocity of the host . in the most massive ( @xmath5 , model q1 ; table  [ table : ics ] ) halo ,",
    "this is manifested in broad ( @xmath70 ) predicted co emission line widths , whereas in the halos with lower circular velocity ( quasars q2 , q3 ) , the mean co line width is @xmath71 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that in all cases , while the aforementioned trends hold , a large range of line widths is permitted at all points as they are strongly sightline - dependent .",

    "it is possible that not all quasars at 6 form via numerous violent merging events , but rather through a more ordered merger .",
    "it is thus worth quantifying the potential dependence of line width on merger history , and in particular , how a more ordered merger remnant may affect the observed line widths . to provide a limiting example ,",
    "we have conducted a test simulation of a coplanar binary merger in a halo of @xmath5 ( model q4 ; table  [ table : ics ] ) .",

    "the percentage of sightlines compatible with observations in the binary merger q4 arises from a limited range of angles a disk can be from face on to keep line widths within a particular limit .",

    "this probability then represents the upper limit of fraction of sightlines that will be compatible with the observed co line width in for disks with circular velocity @xmath65 .",
    "this clarifies why the percentage of sightlines compatible with observations in the massive multiple - merger models ( q1-q3 ) is relatively small . the cold gas in the three quasars which formed out of multiple non - idealized mergers ( q1-q3 ) settles into rotating nuclear disks .",
    "as an aside , it is interesting to note that the amount of rotationally supported gas is seen to be dependent on the mass of the galaxy .",
    "namely , the lower mass halos show a larger percentage of gas in stable rotation .",
    "to illustrate this , in figure  [ figure : rotsupport ] we show the fraction of rotationally supported gas for quasars q1-q3 as a function of redshift , noting in particular the points of peak quasar activity . when the most massive galaxy ( q1 ) is seen as a quasar ,",
    "roughly 50% of the  gas is rotationally supported .",
    "conversely , in the lowest mass model ( q3 ) , @xmath93 of the gas is rotationally supported .",
    "this may be a direct result of the amount of energy input from the central quasar during these times .",
    "cox et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrated that the amount of rotationally supported gas in galaxy mergers decreases with increasingly efficient winds . during the peak of the quasar phase ,",
    "the black hole luminosity is over an order of magnitude brighter in model q1 than in q3 .    in either case ,",
    "though , large percentages of the gas in all of the quasars ( q1-q3 ) are seen to be rotationally supported during the quasar phase . because of this , the number of sightlines compatible with observations is roughly characterized by equation  ( [ eq : probability ] ) .",
    "thus , the most massive model ( q1 ) shows line widths compatible with observations @xmath94 of the time , consistent with a predicted upper limit of @xmath95 for @xmath5 halos .",
    "similarly , in the lowest mass model ( q3 ) , where @xmath93 of the gas is rotationally supported , the 10% of sightlines seen to be compatible with observed line widths is compatible with the predicted upper limit of @xmath96 . the fact that the modeled fraction of sightlines is always slightly smaller than the toy model in equation  ( [ eq : probability ] ) owes to the fact that some of the gas in the galaxy is still highly dynamical and not virialized .",
    "given the dispersion of co ( j=6 - 5 ) line widths along different lines of sight , an interesting relation to explore is one between the optical quasar luminosity and co emission line width in search of potential observational selection effects which may tend observations of 6 quasars toward smaller line widths . in figure",

    "there is a general trend for sightlines which show the brightest rest - frame @xmath17-band luminosity to have smaller co line widths .",
    "this can be understood via decomposition of the quasar luminosity into its stellar and agn components . specifically , while the stellar luminosity does not vary much with viewing angle ,",
    "the contribution of the central black hole to the total luminosity is strongly dependent on the viewing angle with respect to the rotating molecular gas .",
    "directions which view the molecular disk in an edge - on configuration result in a heavily obscured central agn . along these sightlines ,",
    "the emergent co emission line is typically broad ( e.g. bottom right panel , figure  [ figure : z6a6mapspec ] ) .",
    "conversely , when the molecular disk is seen in a more face - on viewing angle ( and thus has narrower co emission lines ) , the central agn can be viewed relatively unobscured , and the attenuated rest - frame @xmath17-band luminosity is consequently higher .",
    "this effect is typical during the quasar phase , and only rarely is the black hole relatively unattenuated through an edge - on sightline , which causes broad co lines to be visible when the rest - frame @xmath17-band luminosity peaks .",
    "the results of this relationship between bolometric luminosity and line width suggest a potential selection effect which may cause quasars selected for optical luminosity to have systematically lower co line widths , owing to the preferred face - on viewing angle for the molecular disk . in figure",

    "this selection effect is robust across both the lower mass halo models as well . in models q2 and q3 , the fraction of sightlines compatible with observations increases to @xmath98 and 25% respectively , for the highest luminosity cuts .",
    "finally , we note that the viewing angles corresponding to the smallest ( @xmath99 ) line widths in our simulations typically fall within a @xmath100 range in polar and azimuthal angle from face - on .",

    "our simulations show that 6 quasars which form in massive halos will characteristically have broad mean line widths , consistent with simple virial arguments . the mean simulated line widths are in apparent contradiction to observed narrow ( @xmath102 ) line widths of the sole co detection at 6 ( walter et al .",

    "this owes to the competing effects of smaller quasar lifetimes in the lower mass halos , but more lower mass halos in the simulated cosmological volume .",

    "one result of this work is to motivate observational tests of these models .",
    "a direct prediction of these simulations is that a co survey from a large sample of quasars at 6 which probes lower on the optical luminosity function may directly constrain the range of potential line widths which originate from high redshift quasars . at the median rest - frame @xmath17-band luminosity",

    "for example , if a dusty molecular torus exists on scales smaller than @xmath108 pc and provides high levels of obscuration along sightlines other than face - on , then the variation of optical luminosity with inclination angle will be steeper than suggested by figure  [ figure : fwhm - qsolum ] .",
    "it is thus not a straightforward assumption that optical surveys will need to probe only an order of magnitude lower in rest - frame @xmath17-band luminosity to test these models as figure  [ figure : fwhm - qsolum ] suggests , but rather it is in the limit that quasars with relatively inclined disks at 6 can be detected that these models predict a broad range of co line widths at lower optical luminosities .",
    "a more clear test may come from observations of the progenitors of 6 quasars themselves .",
    "for example , a direct prediction from these models is that co observations of either the most massive progenitor galaxies prior to the merger ( e.g. at 8 ; see table 1 of li et al .",
    "2007 ) , or the ongoing mergers themselves may exhibit a large dispersion in co line widths , with median velocity dispersion reflective of the halo virial velocity ( figure  [ figure : meanfwhm ] ) .",
    "the identification of potential progenitors at 7 is predicted to be feasible through @xmath109-band dropouts ( robertson et al .",

    "the model halos presented here reflect the range of halo masses in our cosmological simulation which were feasibly able to create a 6 quasar .",
    "as such , based on the line widths seen in our lowest mass host galaxy ( q3 ) , samples of co detections at 6 which probe quasars with a range of disk inclination angles should find a median line width at least @xmath59 twice the value of the sole detection .",
    "surveys which observe quasars with inclined molecular disks and still find consistently narrow line widths may reflect an inability of our radiative transfer simulations to fully capture the appropriate physics necessary to predict accurate co line widths form these early universe galaxies . if , for example , our assumptions regarding molecular gas content or co abundances are incorrect , it could be that co emission is preferentially seen in lower velocity gas in the host galaxy .",
    "alternative possibilities may include super - eddington accretion for the central black hole which may allow for luminous quasars at 6 in less massive halos than those adopted here ( e.g. volonteri & rees 2005 ) .",

    ", we emphasize that the simulations presented here _ do not _ predict large ( @xmath135 ) line widths for quasars which form at lower ( e.g. 2 ) redshift , even if they form in halos of comparable mass to luminous sources at 6 . to illustrate this , we examine the predicted co line widths of the binary merger simulation of narayanan et al .",

    "these models then suggest a self - consistent picture which naturally explains the evolution of co line widths as function of redshift in terms of the circular velocity of the quasar host galaxy halo .",

    "the large spatial extent of co emission in smgs combined with an apparent lack of strong quasar activity has been interpreted as being the consequence of extremely massive and gas rich galaxy mergers early in the evolution of the galaxy , and prior to the quasar phase ( e.g. tacconi et al .",
    "indeed , if smgs form through hierarchical mergers , then the models presented here suggest that the spatially extended and disturbed co morphologies seen in smgs further indicate that these galaxies may be mergers prior to an optical quasar phase ( e.g. figure  [ figure : mapevolution ] ) .",
    "the co line widths of smgs are more enigmatic .",
    "the average co emission line from an smg is typically about double the width of that from a quasar of similar redshifts ( e.g. carilli & wang 2006 ; greve et al .",
    "2005 ; tacconi et al .",
    "the average line width in smgs is @xmath140 ( @xmath141 ) , compared to a mean @xmath91 of 130 seen in 2 quasars ( greve et al . 2005 ) . within the context of the models presented in this work , a number of physical motivations for these differing line widths may be at play .",
    "first , in our models the mean line widths from galaxies with virialized cold gas are seen to roughly correspond with the circular velocity of a host halo . when comparing galaxies of similar redshifts , if smgs are dynamically relaxed , this would imply that smgs may originate in more massive halos than quasars . indeed , clustering measurements made by blain et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have suggested that smgs are hosted by halos slightly larger than quasars at comparable redshifts .",
    "if smgs reside in halos @xmath564 times more massive than typical quasar host galaxies , the difference in co line widths may be accounted for .",
    "an alternative explanation for the line widths may arise from an evolutionary standpoint . specifically , as figure  [ figure : meanfwhm ] shows , there is a typical drop in co line width by a factor of @xmath66 close to the quasar phase of a merging galaxy system .",
    "this owes to gas in the violent environs of a galaxy merger becoming rotationally supported late in the evolution of the merger .",
    "if smgs are a class of objects hosted by halos of similar mass to their quasar counterparts , then it may be that smgs are simply massive mergers at 2 prior to their active quasar phase . certainly co line profiles and morphologies from smgs are consistent with merging activity ( greve et al .",
    "2005 ; tacconi et al .",
    "2006 ; narayanan et al . 2006 ; d. narayanan et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations of merging galaxies coupled with self - consistent radiative transfer solutions have pointed to a picture in which smgs may be mergers caught in a phase of massive black hole growth , though prior to an optical quasar phase ( chakrabarti et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "other authors have suggested that smgs may be similar to quasars in their place in galaxy evolution , but simply viewed more edge - on .",
    "carilli & wang ( 2004 ) suggested that if these 2 galaxy populations are truly of the same class , then one can infer a mean viewing angle of @xmath142 for quasars , whereas smgs are more likely randomly oriented .",
    "finally , it may be that the co emission properties of smgs are not explained by physical models such at those presented in this work .",
    "if , for example , the massive star formation rates are fueled at least in part by accretion of gas from the host halo ( which is seen to occur for at least some galaxies in cosmological simulations ; see e.g. finlator et al .",
    "2006 ) , the co line widths may not reflect the circular velocity of the system , at least during phases of elevated star formation , as they do in merging galaxies .",
    "in summary , correspondence between some observed trends of molecular line emission in the models of hierarchical 6 quasar formation and smgs which form at later times suggest that it is plausible that smgs fall naturally into a merger - driven evolutionary sequence , though , at least from molecular line diagnostics alone , its location on this sequence is not completely clear . of course , alternative scenarios can not be ruled out here .",
    "further models of hierarchical galaxy mergers appropriate for 2 will have to be examined in order to further quantify the relation of co emission properties to the evolution of smgs .",
    "we have applied non - lte radiative transfer simulations to cosmological and hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations to predict the co emission from representative 6 quasars that are modeled to form hierarchically in massive @xmath143 halos .",
    "we made predictions concerning the co excitation patterns , morphologies , and line widths in this extreme class of objects .",
    "we further made broad comparisons to the only current co detection at 6 , at = 6.42 .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .   owing to very warm and dense conditions in the molecular ism",
    ", the co flux density is predicted to peak at the j=8 level during the early , hierarchical formation process of the quasar host galaxy ( 8) , when the sfr can be as high as @xmath115 . during the peak quasar phase",
    ", the central agn reduces the nuclear starburst , and the sfr drops to @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the co flux density peaks at the j=5 - 6 level .",
    "these excitation conditions are indicative of an ongoing starburst , and are consistent with observations of .",
    "as the gas becomes more diffuse and the starburst dies down in the post - quasar phase ( 6 ) , the peak in the co flux is predicted to drop to j@xmath144 .",
    "the co morphologies of 6 quasars may exhibit multiple emission peaks during the active quasar phase , owing to separated peaks of high density emission that have not yet coalesced .",
    "the multiple emission peaks in the morphology of the co ( j=3 - 2 ) gas during the quasar phase of our simulations are very similar to observations of , and are robust along many viewing angles .",
    "these results imply that a merger - driven formation scenario for 6 quasars produces co morphologies consistent with that of .",

    ", the co line widths from quasars at 6 are reflective of the virial velocity of the host halo , though there exists a large sightline - dependent dispersion in line widths . during the hierarchical buildup of the host galaxy ,",
    "the median line widths are roughly twice the virial velocity , and settle to the virial velocity during the quasar phase . during the quasar phase ,",
    "the sightline - averaged line width for the @xmath5 halo is @xmath145 . in the lowest mass halo ( @xmath3 ) the sightline averaged line width",

    "a fraction of sightlines in each model is compatible with observations , and is a strong function of halo mass .",
    "specifically , the number of sightlines with narrow line widths compatible with observations increases with decreasing halo mass . the most massive @xmath5 halo shows @xmath94 of sightlines compatible with observations .",
    "the @xmath3 halo has line widths similar to observations of @xmath79 of the time .",
    "the percentage of sightlines compatible with observations increase owing to selection effects ( next point ) .",
    "quasars at 6 selected for optical luminosity may preferentially be in a face - on configuration as this provides the least obscuration of the central black hole . in these configurations ,",
    "the co line widths are narrower , thus causing quasars selected for optical luminosity to preferentially have narrower line widths than their sightline averaged values .",
    "the fraction of sightlines with line widths compatible with observations increases to 10 - 25% when considering quasars selected for optical luminosity .",
    "this suggests that these models may be in agreement with observations if is being observed in a face - on configuration .",
    "a direct consequence of these selection effects is that in order to observe the full dispersion in co line widths in 6 quasars , observations must probe quasars with edge - on molecular disks ( which are typically lower on the optical luminosity function ) .",
    "because of the evolution of @xmath132 with redshift of halos of similar mass , quasars which form in @xmath18 halos ( as they are thought to ; see e.g. croom et al . 2005 ; shen et al .",
    "2007 ) at lower redshift will naturally have smaller line widths , compatible with observations .",
    "we explicitly show this by examining the line widths of a binary merger simulation appropriate for present epochs . in this light",
    ", the simulations presented here _ do not _ predict large ( @xmath146 ) co line widths for quasars which form at lower redshifts , but rather a suggestive self - consistent model for the potential origin of co line widths in quasars at both low and high redshift .",
    "our merger - driven model for quasar formation predicts a host galaxy that lies on the relation during the active quasar phase ( li et al .",

    "dynamical masses derived from the median line widths are a better representation of the true mass .",
    "there is a large range in derived dynamical masses coincident with the large sightline - dependent range of line widths seen at a given time .",

    "<S> we investigate the nature of molecular gas emission from 6 quasars via the commonly observed tracer of , carbon monoxide ( co ) . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve these means by combining non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) radiative transfer calculations with merger - driven models of 6 quasar formation that arise naturally in @xmath0-cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) structure formation simulations . motivated by observational constraints , we consider four representative 6 quasars formed in the halo mass range @xmath1 from different merging histories . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , owing to massive starbursts and funneling of dense gas into the nuclear regions of merging galaxies , the co is highly excited during both the hierarchical buildup of the host galaxy and the quasar phase and the co flux density peaks between j=5 - 8 . </S>",
    "<S> the co morphology of 6 quasars often exhibits multiple co emission peaks which arise from molecular gas concentrations which have not yet fully coalesced . </S>",
    "<S> both of these results are found to be consistent with the sole co detection at 6 , in quasar . </S>",
    "<S> quasars which form at 6 display a large range of sightline - dependent line widths . </S>",
    "<S> the sightline dependencies are such that the narrowest line widths are when the rotating molecular gas associated with the quasar is viewed face - on ( when the @xmath2 is largest ) , and broadest when the quasar is seen edge on ( and the @xmath2 is lowest ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we find that for all models selection effects exist such that quasars selected for optical luminosity are preferentially seen to be face - on which may result in co detections of optically luminous quasars at 6 having line widths narrower than the median . the mean sightline - averaged line width is found to be reflective of the circular velocity of the host halo , and thus scales with halo mass . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the mean line width for the @xmath3 halo is @xmath4 , while the median for the @xmath5 quasar host is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the host halo mass , approximately 2 - 10% of sightlines in our modeled quasars are found to have narrow line widths compatible with observations of . </S>",
    "<S> when considering the aforementioned selection effects , these percentages increase to 10 - 25% for quasars selected for optical luminosity . when accounting for both temporal evolution of co line widths in galaxies , as well as the redshift evolution of halo circular velocities , these models can self - consistently account for the observed line widths of both submillimeter galaxies and quasars at 2 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find that the dynamical mass derived from the _ mean _ sightline - averaged line widths provide a good estimate of the total mass , and allows for a massive molecular reservoir , supermassive black hole , and stellar bulge , consistent with the local relation . </S>"
