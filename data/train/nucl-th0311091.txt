    "<S> we calculate the binding energy and deformation parameter for light nuclei _ with _ and _ without _ pairing using a deformed relativistic mean field model . </S>",
    "<S> the role of bcs - type pairing effect is analyzed for ne and f isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated odd - even staggering and the deformation parameters argue strongly against the role of pairing in the light nuclei .    the odd - even staggering ( oes ) of nuclear masses has been recognized since the early days of nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> it manifests itself in the fact that the binding energy of a system with an odd particle number is lower than the arithmetic mean of the energies of the two neighboring even - particle - number systems . </S>",
    "<S> hkkinen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , using the density - functional theory , argued that light alkali - metal clusters and light @xmath0 nuclei have a similar pattern of oes , irrespective of differences in the interactions between the fermions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they concluded that the oes in small nuclei appears to be a mere deformation effect rather than a consequence of pairing .    on the other hand , satula _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , claimed that the oes in light atomic nuclei is strongly affected by both nucleonic pairing and the deformed mean field . according to them , the oes without taking pairing into account </S>",
    "<S> is simply due to jahn - teller effect @xcite and it is substantially smaller than the experimental observation . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to note that , following ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the pairing energy is about @xmath1 mev for a nuclear system of mass number @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the rather small value of the correlation energy reflects the fact that only a few single particle levels lie within the interval of strong pair correlations . </S>",
    "<S> thus the condition for the treatment in terms of a static pair field is only marginally satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> this makes clear that the concept of pairing may have some meaning for heavy mass nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> but the basis for pairing correlations in light nuclei is very questionable .    </S>",
    "<S> the bohr - mottelson - pines idea of applying bcs type pairing theory to nuclei and the mottelson - valatin model of pairing disappearance @xcite are attractive ideas from the theoretical point of view , one should still approach this problem with caution , since in a nucleus one is dealing with a small number of particles . the number of particles and the number of states available near the fermi surface are too limited in a nucleus , whereas in a solid ( where the bcs theory originated ) one has an enormously large number of particles and number of states .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into consideration the above contradictory predictions , in the present letter we calculate the oes with and without pairing for ne - isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the binding energies and other quantities of interest by performing axially deformed relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inclusion of bcs - type pairing does not improve the oes for light nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the calculated result of deformation parameter argues strongly against pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the relativistic lagrangian of interacting nucleons and mesons ( protons , neutrons , scalar and vector mesons along with electromagnetic field interacting with charged protons ) . </S>",
    "<S> the euler - lagrange field equations for mesons , nucleons and electromagnetic potentials are obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleons satisfy the dirac equations in the potential field of the bosons . </S>",
    "<S> the mesons and the photons are assumed to be classical fields whose sources are the densities and currents of nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinors and the boson field wave functions in axially symmetric deformed harmonic oscillator basis with some initial deformation . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of oscillator shells ( @xmath3 ) are used as the basis for expansion of the fermion and boson fields . </S>",
    "<S> the set of coupled equations are solved numerically by self - consistent iteration method with the nl3 parameter set @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be noted that the rmf parameter sets are determined by fitting the nuclear matter properties , neutron - proton asymmetry energy , root mean square radii and binding energy of some spherical nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> there are no further adjustments of parameters to be made . </S>",
    "<S> hence any discrepancy with pairing model for the nuclei is a genuine result . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath4 is evaluated from the resulting quadrupole moment .    </S>",
    "<S> we do rmf calculations with and without pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the pairing calculations are done in the constant gap approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the constant gaps for protons and neutrons are evaluated from the equations @xcite : @xmath5 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the experimental ( or extrapolated from data ) binding energy @xcite with neutron number @xmath8 and proton number @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> when the experimental ( or extrapolated ) data is not know ( e.g. , for nuclei away from stability valley ) , the gap is evaluated from the general expression of bohr and mottelson @xcite : @xmath10 the calculations for the odd - even and odd - odd nuclei in an axially symmetric deformed basis is a tough task in the rmf model . to take care of the lone odd nucleon , one has to violate the time - reversal symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the present calculation we have not carefully taken into consideration such effects . at the level of bulk properties for nuclei , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the time reversal symmetry is not very significant , while its effect is significant in the determination of other ( time - odd ) properties like the magnetic moment , etc . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is expected that the results for binding energy and quadrupole moment may not change much when one performs the exact calculation by including the effects of the time - reversal asymmetry for the odd nucleons in an odd - even or odd - odd system . in the present rmf study , </S>",
    "<S> apart from the @xmath11 meson field , only the time components @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 of the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and photon fields are retained , since these are important for the ground state bulk properties . </S>",
    "<S> a measurable time - asymmetric field would find many nucleons in time - reversal - asymmetric configurations and hence constitutes an excited state . </S>",
    "<S> hence the space components of these fields ( which are odd under time - reversal and parity ) , as also the time - reversal breaking effect of odd nucleon , are not considered for the bulk properties ( binding energy and matter distribution ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the odd nucleon is considered for its contribution to binding energy and matter distribution in the approximation of a time - reversal symmetric mean - field ( average of the @xmath17 lone nucleons are taken for the mean - field potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> observables like binding energy , charge or matter density and quadrupole moment correspond to even operators as far as time - reversal symmetry is concerned and hence are fairly well explained in the approximation scheme adopted by us .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now come to the results of our rmf calculations . </S>",
    "<S> first of all we calculate the binding energy ( @xmath18 ) and quadrupole deformation parameter ( @xmath4 ) for ne and f isotopes , setting @xmath19 . from the calculated binding energies we evaluate the one - neutron ( @xmath20 ) and one - proton separation @xmath21 energies using the relations @xcite : @xmath22 and @xmath23 again we repeat the calculations taking @xmath24 and @xmath25 into account as defined in equations ( 1 - 3 ) and evaluated the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 using equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , respectively .    the binding energy with and without pairing for ne and f isotopes are compared with experimental data @xcite in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . from the figure , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the inclusion of pairing does not improve the binding to any significant extent . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the results without pairing are favored for the majority of the isotopes . in case of f - isotopes , the inclusion of pairing </S>",
    "<S> gives severe over binding . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we have compared the quadrupole deformation parameter ( @xmath4 ) with the experimental measurements @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 values are calculated _ with _ and _ without _ taking pairing into consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 values without pairing ( square ) gives better fit with experimental measurements for known cases , whereas the rmf calculation predicts very small quadrupole deformation parameter in the presence of pairing . in an earlier paper @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the binding energy ( @xmath18 ) and root mean square radii are not very sensitive to the pairing correlation , but the shapes of the nuclei , particularly near the stability line , depend very much on the pairing gap . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with experimental data shows that a zero pairing strength is preferred in the light and light - medium nuclei region .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that even - even nuclei have consistently more binding than neighboring even - odd ( or odd - even ) nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the binding energies of odd - odd nuclei are systematically less than these . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to binding energy gain arising from interaction @xmath28 or @xmath29 for nucleons occupying time - reversal symmetric orbits ( @xmath17 degenerate orbits in axially symmetric nuclei ) in even particle configurations . </S>",
    "<S> usually bcs or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) methods are used to study pairing in nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a closer study shows that odd - even staggering is present in the binding energies of deformed nuclei in a mean field description .    </S>",
    "<S> the one - neutron ( @xmath26 ) and one - proton ( @xmath27 ) separation energies for ne - isotopes are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) , respectively . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) it is clearly evident that the @xmath26 values fit well with pairing for @xmath30 and 20 , whereas for all other isotopes the one - neutron separation energy is closer to the experiment in the absence of pairing ( square in the figure ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the @xmath27 values argue against pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results are closer to the experimental data for @xmath31 and @xmath32 with pairing , whereas it very much deviates ( remains same with the _ without _ pairing case for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) from the experimental data for rest of the isotopes ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole deformation for @xmath36f are almost identical in both _ with _ and _ without _ pairing cases . </S>",
    "<S> thus the oes is also found to be almost same . </S>",
    "<S> the value of oes , as also the magnitude of @xmath4 , assumes different values in cases _ with _ and _ without _ pairing .    </S>",
    "<S> the oes is caused by interaction of nucleons occupying _ paired _ orbitals in even nuclei and absence of such _ paired _ partner for the lone nucleon in odd nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> thus interactions @xmath28 and @xmath29 and configuration mixing present in deformed mean field is the major factor governing oes in deformed nuclei @xcite . no bcs or hfb pairing ( with the attendant number fluctuations ) </S>",
    "<S> is needed for deformed nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be noted here that the quadrupole deformation parameter becomes worse , when we include the bcs - type pairing correlation ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . also the oes gets affected . on the other hand , in the absence of pairing , the @xmath4 values as well as the oes are reproduced quite well . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the odd - even staggering in binding energy is mainly due to the effect of the mean field ( not due to pairing ) .    in summary , we calculated the binding energy and quadrupole deformation parameter in the frame - work of rmf formalism for ne - isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed the effects of bcs - type pairing correlation on odd - even staggering and @xmath4 . from the present rmf results ( figs . 1 - 3 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we draw the following conclusions :    the inclusion of pairing does not change the binding energy drastically for light nuclei region . from a further inspection of the binding energy , it is observed that the calculated binding energies are closer to the experimental data in the absence of bcs - type pairing correlation .    the trend of quadrupole deformation parameter rules out the presence of bcs - type pairing in light nuclei region .    </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of @xmath26 and @xmath27 with the experimental values clearly shows that the odd - even staggering in light nuclei is a mean field phenomenon .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that bcs ( or hfb ) type pairing correlation is not the cause for the odd - even staggering in light nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to the jahn - teller mean field effects . </S>"
