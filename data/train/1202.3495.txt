    "bacterial colonies  @xcite , insect swarms  @xcite , bird flocks  @xcite , and fish schools  @xcite are all examples of biological systems that display distinct collective motion .",
    "while they differ in many specific aspects , they also share an important characteristic : each one is made up of individual organisms that are self - propelling and move guided by interactions with their surrounding neighbors .",
    "when we strip down collectively moving systems in this way , we obviously leave out important biological details , but in return we obtain a good starting point for a theoretical understanding of collective motion .",
    "our central concern in this paper is to introduce and study a very simple model ( a _ minimal _ model ) where individuals move with variable speed , and to show through theory and simulations that it displays new properties not found in models with constant speed .    in recent years ,",
    "research on self - propelled ( or _ active _ ) systems has grown steadily . starting with the seminal work by vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite , we now find a range of theoretical , numerical and experimental studies @xcite concerning a number of aspects of their dynamics . in vicsek s original work   @xcite , a minimal model of self - propelled collective motion ",
    "now known as the _ vicsek model_was introduced , similar in flavor to the equilibrium xy - model @xcite , but exhibiting new physical properties due to its non - equilibrium nature . in the standard vicsek model ,",
    "each individual is described as a point particle with a given position and heading direction .",
    "all particles advance with the same constant speed and decide their next heading direction based on the headings of all particles in their local neighborhood .",
    "particles are also subject to noise , which alters their chosen direction . under these simple conditions",
    ", the vicsek model exhibits a dynamical phase transition from a disordered state ( with no polarization order ) to an ordered state ( where particles align and advance together ) as the noise level is decreased , or the density of particles increased .",
    "following its initial formulation , many variations of the original vicsek model @xcite have been introduced to carry out analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite studies of collective motion .",
    "however , almost all of these models consider particles that advance with equal constant speed .",
    "but in biological systems the speed of each individual could vary in response to its neighbors dynamics , and it is reasonable to expect this variation to be important for the resulting collective motion .",
    "furthermore , in recent experiments on fish schooling , it has been observed that fish swimming in disordered regions typically move slower than those in ordered ones @xcite .",
    "this observation supports the idea that variable speed may play an important role in the collective dynamics of real groups of self - propelled individuals .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an experimentally motivated minimal model describing the collective motion in groups of self - propelled particles with variable speed , and study it analytically and numerically .",
    "the model is almost identical to the standard vicsek model , but here _ both _ the speed and orientation of each particle depends on the state of its local neighborhood . while the choice of speed dynamics is motivated by our experimental results on schooling fish , we emphasize that the model is not intended to function as a detailed replicate of this biological system . note",
    "that models similar to the one presented here were used in two recent numerical studies focusing on how variable speed can enhance convergence to an ordered state @xcite .",
    "these studies , however , did not address the analytical results or novel spatial dynamics discussed here .",
    "starting from our model , we derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations of motion for the density of particles and for the order parameter field , which undergoes a symmetry breaking transition at the critical point , like in the original vicsek model . using these equations",
    ", we find an analytical relation between the coarse - grained particle speed and the local density of particles , which we verify numerically .",
    "we then study our variable speed model numerically , characterizing its ordered and disordered phases as a function of the noise , mean particle density , and variable speed rule . in particular , we discover in the disordered regime a novel state where static cluster are formed , containing particles moving at speeds close to zero . within these clusters ,",
    "each particle receives conflicting heading information from its neighbors and thus advances at low speeds , which in turn limits its ability to spread its own heading information throughout the group .",
    "we hypothesize that this mechanism could also be present in more realistic systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce our variable speed model using new experimental results to motivate the particle speed dynamics . in section",
    "iii we derive the corresponding coarse - grained hydrodynamic equations of motion and compare them to the constant speed case .",
    "section iv presents numerical results that confirm the validity of the analytical approximations and explore regimes beyond these , where the hydrodynamic description is no longer valid .",
    "we study here the static clusters described above . finally , sections v and vi contain our discussion and conclusions .",
    "fish schools are a clear example of systems exhibiting collective motion . to motivate the choice of speed dynamics in our variable speed model we examined experimentally the relationship between individual speed and local polarization order in a school of 300 golden shiners ( _ notemigonus crysoleucas _ ) swimming freely in a shallow tank . a snapshot from the experiment is shown in fig .  [ fig01](a ) .",

    "it is apparent that there is typically a strong ( superlinear ) relationship between the speed of an individual fish and the alignment of its local neighborhood .",
    "note that this result does not reveal anything about the causality , since we only show here correlations within the data .",

    "the corresponding curves are strongly correlated , with the average global dynamics following the local variable speed rule .",
    "the disordered branch of the bistable solution therefore acts similar to an absorbing state ; once it is reached the particle dynamics slow down so much that it is very hard to escape .",
    "we turn our attention to the spatial dynamics observed in the variable speed model .",
    "this is where the strongest differences with the constant speed case emerge .",
    "we find that , in the disordered state close to the transition , a phase separation occurs where some particles condense into almost immobile high - density clusters while the rest form a low - density ballistic gas between them .",
    "figure [ fig07 ] presents simulation snapshots of the variable speed model with @xmath95 , @xmath116 , @xmath128 and three different levels of noise .",
    "the length of each line is proportional to the speed of the corresponding particle .",
    "the four panels display : an ordered state ( a ) , a disordered state ( b ) , and the two branches of the bistable state discussed in the previous section ( c and d ) .",
    "snapshot ( a ) corresponds to a simulation with low noise @xmath132 .",
    "the system is ordered ( @xmath27 is much lower than its critical value @xmath133 ) , with particles moving in the same approximate direction .",

    "( [ speed ] ) and particles advance at speeds close to @xmath34 .",
    "by contrast , snapshot ( b ) corresponds to a high noise , @xmath134 , disordered case . here , particles are almost immobile .",
    "due to the high mean density , even if the noise spreads out particles almost homogeneously , each one has several neighbors within its interaction range . given the low local order , @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ speed ] ) and particle speeds are close to zero",
    ".    snapshots ( c ) and ( d ) are particularly interesting as they display previously unobserved dynamics , not possible in a constant speed model , that occur when the noise is close to its critical value . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig05 ] and [ fig06 ] , we have in this case bistable global dynamics .",
    "the two metastable solution branches correspond to an ordered state with high @xmath73 and to a disordered state with low @xmath73 .",
    "both states organize into a high - density cluster surrounded by a low - density particle gas . in panel",
    "( c ) , the cluster moves as indicated by the red arrow , while in panel ( d ) it remains almost static .",
    "larger simulations can display several clusters with similar behavior .",
    "particles surrounding the clusters move rapidly .    while the presence of moving clusters is common in vicsek - like models @xcite , static clusters such as the one on fig .",
    "[ fig07](d ) have not been previously observed .",
    "the mechanism that leads to their nucleation therefore deserves more a detailed analysis .",
    "as the system fluctuates between an ordered and a disordered state ( being close to the transition point ) , it reaches situations where particles are typically not locally aligned .",
    "this leads to the formation of groups of slow moving particles that grow as other particles reach them , because incoming particles suddenly confront high density disordered regions , thereby losing orientation and slowing down drastically .",
    "once clusters are formed , they can only lose particles at their frontier . there",
    ", some particles will spontaneously align due to noise fluctuations and manage to escape if they head away from the cluster , since they will feel less and less the influence from the disordered region .",
    "eventually a single particle , or a small group , will be far enough removed to feel only its own influence , forming a low density ballistic gas between clusters .",
    "particles in this gas are isolated and their @xmath14 is therefore close to @xmath97 .",
    "they move at speeds close to @xmath34 until they reach another cluster and condense again .",
    "these clusters will thus grow until their absorption rate is balanced by their evaporation rate . in the bulk of the clusters particles advance very slowly , which hinders their ability to reorder .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that , when noise is present , vicsek - like models can only reach an ordered state if particles are able to move with respect to each other , which allows them to switch neighbors and establish effective long - range interactions over time @xcite .",
    "if particles always interact with the same neighbors , the system becomes equivalent to an xy - model , for which the mermin - wagner theorem shows that no long - range order can exist in two dimensions at nonzero noise levels @xcite .",
    "hence , the lack of relative particle motion in the bulk of a static cluster helps stabilize it in a disordered , immobile state .    , with @xmath128 and different levels of noise intensity . as the noise level is increased , the typical particle speed decreases until static clusters start nucleating for @xmath136 .",
    "these clusters absorb most particles , while a few isolated particles continue to move between them at maximal speed , as shown by the peaks at @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "( b ) distribution of individual particle speeds for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] , with @xmath134 ( disordered state ) and different values of the mean density @xmath41 . here , static clusters are always present , their size increasing with @xmath41 .",
    "particles are again either frozen within these clusters or moving alone between them at maximal speed.,title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]    , with noise intensity just below ( @xmath139 ) or above ( @xmath140 ) the critical noise value , and different values of the variable speed exponent @xmath18 .",
    "when in the ordered state ( a ) , the typical particle speed gradually decreases as @xmath18 is increased , from a fixed @xmath138 value for @xmath38 , to @xmath141 for @xmath95 . in the disordered state ( b ) , by contrast , the typical particle speed is reduced much more abruptly for any @xmath142 , where the static clusters described in the main text are nucleated.,title=\"fig:\",width=325 ]    in order to study how the particles distribute between those that are part of a static cluster and those that are not , we plot on fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] the individual particle speed distribution for various values of noise and density .",
    "panel ( a ) shows that , as the noise level is incresased , first the typical particle speed is smoothly reduced and then a zero - speed peak emerges , corresponding to static clusters . while in the ordered phase , groups of particles therefore move slower and slower until the critical noise level is reached and static clusters start nucleating . in panel",
    "( b ) the noise level is fixed at a high value ( @xmath134 ) , so the system is always in the disordered state . as we vary the density @xmath41 , the particle speed distribution remains bimodal .",
    "particles can either be within a static cluster and stop advancing or be part of the inter - cluster gas and move at maximum speed @xmath34 while remaining isolated .",
    "as the mean density is increased , more particles are trapped in static clusters and thus have zero speed .",
    "finallly , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] the individual particle - speed distribution as a function of the variable speed exponent @xmath18 .",
    "we consider two parameter regimes , one with noise intensity just below the critical noise value [ fig .",
    "[ fig09](a ) , @xmath143 and one just above it [ fig .",
    "[ fig09](b ) , @xmath134 ] . in the first situation ,",
    "the typical particle speed gradually decreases as @xmath18 is increased , from @xmath145 when @xmath38 , to @xmath141 for @xmath95 . in the disordered state , by contrast , the typical particle speed is reduced much more abruptly for any @xmath142 , quickly giving rise to the nucleation of static clusters .",
    "the analysis above demonstrates the similarities and differences between standard , minimal constant speed models of collective motion @xcite and our variable speed version .",
    "we show that the variable speed case displays an order - disorder transition analogous to that observed for constant speed . in both cases , as the noise level is decreased or the mean density increased , the system goes from a disordered state to an ordered one where they align to a common heading .",
    "the dynamics associated to the transition , however , are very different .",
    "an interesting finding is that our variable speed rule induces an inverse power - law relationship between the speed of a particle , or the level of order in its surroundings , and the local density .",
    "note that this is opposite to the typical correlation between _ global _ order and _ mean _ density in minimal models @xcite .",
    "indeed , high mean density makes particles interact in average with more neighbors , which increases the level of order , as it has been shown numerically and analytically ( in the mean field approximation ) @xcite .    while the model presented in this paper",
    "is far from realistic , the inverse relationship between local quantities specified above appears to be robust enough to persist in less idealized systems . in the golden shiner data we find not only the correlation between individual speed and local polarization order that inspired our variable speed rule",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) , but also an inverse relationship between local order , or particle speed , and local density analogous to that deduced from our model ( data not shown ) .",
    "we emphasize that we can not deduce a causal relation between these effects from the experimental data . by establishing connections between them in a specific model , however",
    ", we have provided a mechanism through which they could be robustly related in generic situations .",
    "another observation from our study is the nucleation of static clusters . in simulation videos the dynamical process leading to these clusters looks similar to jamming in granular materials @xcite . despite the differences between these processes",
    ", we can draw some analogies that go beyond their visual appearance . in physical systems ,",
    "the opposing forces on jammed particles add to zero , stopping their flow .",
    "likewise , here opposing headings ( i.e. conflicting information ) add up to zero , producing no local order and therefore a vanishing particle speed .",
    "we also note that both jammed and static regions will grow by recruiting moving particles that reach them and are stopped by opposing interactions .",
    "finally , an additional similarity is given by the dynamics in the bulk and edges of the clusters .",
    "in both cases edge particles can escape if the sum of all surrounding interactions points away from the cluster , while bulk particles can only move if there is a pathway of particles with a non - zero sum of interactions along it that percolates through the group @xcite .    despite the similarities outlined above",
    ", the mechanisms behind both processes are very different .",
    "jamming is produced by contact forces or repulsive potentials , while interactions in the variable speed model are based on heading directions .",
    "another important difference is that in our model static clusters can not form below a certain noise level , while jamming is always increased at lower noise levels .",
    "we end this section by pointing out that our variable speed model considers only one possible way of relating the speed of an individual particle to its local environment .",
    "while the model was inspired by experimental data , we do not claim any specific causal origin to this correlation .",
    "it could result from the interplay of a number of biological interactions that are not considered in this minimal model .",
    "it could also be for example , that alignment is enhanced in faster moving particles or that the speeding rule depends in fact directly on the local density .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of a minimal model of collective motion where the particles move with variable speed .",
    "we found that , despite the simplicity of the algorithm and its similarity with standard constant speed models , our system displays not only the usual ordering transition but also new generic dynamical phenomena that could be present in more realistic models or in experimental systems .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) an inverse correlation between individual particle speed or local polarization order and local density , produced by the imposed relationship between particle speed and local order , and ( 2 ) the nucleation in certain regimes of static clusters where individuals remain immobile , only turning in place without achieving order .",
    "we conclude that including variable speed dynamics in standard self - propelled particle models produces a range of new phenomena that can be relevant for experimental systems .",
    "given the amount of work dedicated up to now to models with constant speed , we hope that our work will serve as a motivation to explore the generic and specific consequences of considering variable speed rules in this class of systems .",
