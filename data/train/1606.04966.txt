    "in the standard model of the galactic diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) , a balance of the heating and cooling processes leads to a thermal steady state ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , in a multiphase medium , different phases coexist at different temperature but in an approximate thermal pressure equilibrium .",
    "broadly , the diffuse multiphase medium consists of the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) , the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , the warm ionized medium ( wim ) and the hot ionized medium ( him ) .",
    "the local physical conditions of the ism are determined by a host of factors , including the local radiation field and cosmic ray energy density , the dust grain abundance , composition and size distribution , material and mechanical energy transfer from both impulsive disturbances such as the ejection of the outer mantle in the late stages of stellar evolution and supernova explosions , as well as more steady sources such as stellar winds .    here",
    "we focus on understanding the [ c  ii ] 158 @xmath0 m fine structure cooling in the diffuse ism .",
    "based on the assumption of thermal steady state , observation of c  ii@xmath3 absorption can be used to estimate the cooling / heating rate and , in turn , to infer the star formation rate ( sfr ) . in detail however , for a given estimated cooling rate , the inferred ultraviolet ( uv ) and cosmic ray flux ( and thus , the sfr ) change significantly depending on the assumed physical conditions of the gas . whether the gas is in the cold or warm phase , for example ,",
    "is one of the important factors in this regard .",
    "thus , to estimate the sfr from c  ii@xmath3 absorption , direct measurement of the temperature of the diffuse ism for the same lines of sight is also necessary .    in this work we present temperature measurements from galactic h",
    "i 21 cm observations toward a sample of high latitude extra - galactic radio sources . for these lines of sight ,",
    "both h  i 21 cm single dish emission spectra and uv spectroscopic data covering c  ii@xmath3 absorption are available .",

    "the details of observation and analysis techniques used here are described in  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the results and relevant discussions are presented in ",
    "[ sec : res ] and  [ sec : dis ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we summarize the conclusions in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "major sources of heating in the diffuse ism are ( i ) photoelectric heating due to ejection of electrons from the dust grains by the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation field , ( ii ) heating due to ionization by cosmic rays and soft x - rays , ( iii ) photoionization of species like c  i , si  i , fe  i etc .",
    "( for which the ionization potential is less than 13.6 ev ) by the fuv radiation field and ( iv ) collisional ionization of h and he by impact with h and @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . since both photoelectric heating and heating due to ionization by cosmic rays and x - rays",
    "are related to the interstellar radiation field , the total heating rate is a function of the sfr ( @xmath5 .",
    "dominant cooling mechanisms in the ism , on the other hand , are ( i ) cooling by the fine structure lines of c  i , c  ii , o  i , si  i , si  ii , s  i , fe  i and fe  ii , ( ii ) metastable transitions of c  ii , o  i , si  ii , s  ii etc .",
    "( iii ) collisional excitation of lyman-@xmath2 and ( iv ) radiative recombination of @xmath4 onto dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "various cooling mechanisms become important at different temperature and thus the total cooling rate depends on the physical conditions like temperature and density of the gas . in thermal steady state , the total cooling rate is equal to the total heating rate , and the physical conditions in different phases can be deduced by considering the thermal and ionization equilibrium .",
    "the [ cii ] 158 @xmath0 m transition is a dominant contributor to the cooling in the ism because of ( 1 ) the high abundance of carbon ( second most abundant metal in gas phase ) , ( 2 ) high abundance of its singly ionized stage , ( 3 ) relatively low optical depth of the transition , and ( 4 ) the easy excitation of the @xmath6 fine structure state ( @xmath7 k ) by collisions under typical conditions in the diffuse ism",
    ". please see @xcite and references therein for an extensive review .",
    "the c  ii radiative cooling rate can be determined directly from the [ c  ii ] line intensity of the @xmath6 to @xmath8 157.7 @xmath0 m transition in the far - infrared ( fir ) .",
    "alternately , the measured column density of c  ii@xmath3 per h  i atom is also believed to be a direct measure of the cooling rate of the gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "c  ii@xmath3 column density can be measured from the c  ii@xmath3 absorption lines at 1037.018    and 1335.708    in the fuv originating in the same @xmath6 state .      for thermal steady state condition",
    ", one can infer the heating rate from the measured cii cooling rate .",
    "the heating rate , in turn , depends on the fluxes of uv photons and cosmic rays , and thus on the sfr . based on this reasoning , observation of c  ii or c  ii@xmath3 is often considered as a tracer of star formation in the local as well as in the high redshift universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a similar argument has been used for high redshift damped lyman-@xmath2 systems ( dlas ) to deduce @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main sources of uncertainty , while estimating the sfr for dlas , is the physical condition , more importantly the temperature , of the gas .",
    "for example , in absence of any direct measurement of temperature , the sfr calculations for the dlas by @xcite were based on the assumption that most of the gas giving rise to the c  ii@xmath3 absorption is in the cnm phase . otherwise , if it is assumed that all the gas is in the wnm phase , then the inferred sfr per unit area in dlas is significantly higher than that of the milky way . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite studied the c  ii@xmath3 absorption along high galactic latitude extra - galactic sources , and , in conjunction with observations of the diffuse h@xmath2 emission along these same line of sight , concluded that most of the c  ii@xmath3 absorption occurs in the wnm or the wim .",
    "this conclusion , that most of the c  ii@xmath3 along high galactic latitudes comes from the wnm / wim , rests in large part on the assumption that there is negligible amount of gas in the cnm phase along these sight lines .",
    "however , there exist several high latitude lines of sight with a high cnm fraction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one way to critically re - examine this uncertainty regarding the inferred sfr , would be to directly measure the temperature of the diffuse h  i in our galaxy for lines of sight with c  ii@xmath3 absorption .",
    "this will constrain the cold gas fraction for lines of sight with h  i column density similar to that of dlas . with this , and the known c  ii@xmath3 column density , it will also be possible , following the same reasoning used for the dlas , to estimate the sfr , and compare it with the galactic sfr derived using other methods .",

    "the three panels in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] show the total c  ii@xmath3 column density along the lines of sight of this sample with respect to the cold , warm and the total h  i column density ( left , middle and right panel , respectively ) .",
    "we do not see any obvious strong correlation in these plots .",
    "this is expected when a significant fraction of c  ii@xmath3 is in the wim phase , as suggested by , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a careful and quantitative statistical analysis , however , shows that the correlation is relatively stronger between n(c  ii@xmath3 ) and the total n(h  i ) compared to the other two .",
    "the kendall @xmath22 coefficient is @xmath53 for the correlation with the total n(h  i ) with a two - sided p - value of @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath22 coefficients for n(h  i)@xmath51 and n(h  i)@xmath52 are @xmath55 ( p @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 ( p @xmath58 ) , respectively .",
    "we also computed the spearman s rank correlation coefficients .",
    "the correlation coefficient in this case is @xmath59 for the total n(h  i ) , but @xmath60 and @xmath61 for the cold and warm gas column density , respectively .",
    "clearly , the correlation is relatively tighter for the total n(h  i ) .",
    "the above values of @xmath22 , p and @xmath62 are computed using lines of sight excluding the non - detections . including the non - detections ( i.e. treating the @xmath28 limits as `` measured values '' ) , and/or excluding ngc  5236 ( for which c  ii@xmath3 column density measurement was problematic ) in the analysis , do not change the results significantly .",
    "even then , n(c  ii@xmath3 ) shows a relatively tighter correlation with the total n(h  i ) .",
    "this correlation , though not visually obvious , indicates that the c  ii@xmath3 abundance is not significantly different in the cold and warm phases .    as a simple consistency check , we considered the correlation between n(c  ii@xmath3 ) and n(h  i ) for individual velocity components .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] . here",
    "also the data are consistent with a significant correlation between the c  ii@xmath3 column density and the total h  i column density ( kendall @xmath63 with p @xmath64 using generalized kendall s @xmath22 test to include the non - detections ) , and with no obvious separation of cnm / wnm components .",
    "this again suggests a similar abundance of c  ii@xmath3 in the cold and warm phases . the thin blue line in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] shows a constant value of n(c  ii@xmath3)/n(h  i ) = @xmath65 corresponding to the median abundance of the sample , and the thick magenta line is the best fit akritas - thiel - sen regression line calculated in nada by consistently including the non - detections also . for the range of column densities of our interest , as shown in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] , these two do not differ much .    as an extension to this",
    ", we have also tried a multivariate linear regression analysis to separate out cnm , wnm and wim contribution to the total observed c  ii@xmath3 column density .",
    "we have used the measured cnm and wnm column densities from this study , and the h@xmath2 intensities from the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) survey @xcite as a proxy for wim column densities .",
    "this analysis suggests a relation @xmath66 indicating a very weak dependence on n(wim)in contrast to the @xcite assertion that most of the c  ii@xmath3 is in the wim phase .",
    "the coefficient for n(cnm ) also has a large uncertainty ( effectively consistent with zero at @xmath67 level ) , indicating strongest ( @xmath68 ) dependence of n(c  ii@xmath3 ) on n(wnm ) .",
    "however , if we drop the dependence on i(h@xmath2 ) , the regression analysis results in @xmath69 implying most of the c  ii@xmath3 to be existing in the cnm . in this case",
    ", the coefficient for n(wnm ) has a large uncertainty and a low statistical significance .",
    "the inconsistent and contradictory result of this analysis may be due to the small number of lines of sight in our study , and it should be carried out for a larger sample to properly separate out c  ii@xmath3 column densities in different ism phases . as the multivariate regression analysis remains inconclusive in this case , based on the observed correlations mentioned earlier ,",
    "the abundance of c  ii@xmath3 is assumed to be same in the cold and warm neutral medium for all further analysis .",
    "we have also derived , by a method similar to that used for the dlas , the sfr per unit area from the observed quantities for our lines of sight .",
    "an accurate estimation of the interstellar radiation field , and therefore the sfr from the observed c  ii@xmath3 and h  i column density , involves computation of thermal and ionization equilibrium conditions in the presence of all of the relevant heating and cooling mechanisms .",
    "this is possible only via detailed numerical simulations , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "rather we used some simplifying assumptions , and results from existing simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the assumption , that all the c  ii@xmath3 absorption arises in the wnm or cnm , respectively overpredicts or underpredicts @xmath9 by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "there are studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , based mostly on nearby galaxy samples , to calibrate c  ii surface brightness and/or luminosity against other independent measurements of sfr . for a comparison ,",
    "we have also used such correlation to derive sfr for our sample . this is done by first converting c  ii@xmath3 column density to a cooling rate ( using equation  3 ) , and then converting it to @xmath9 using equation  2 from @xcite .",
    "the estimated range of @xmath9 , shown in figure  [ fig : fig8 ] , is @xmath94 m@xmath81 yr@xmath21 kpc@xmath82 , with a median ( mean ) value of @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) @xmath97 m@xmath81 yr@xmath21 kpc@xmath82 .",
    "similar to that of the `` cnm model '' , this underpredicts @xmath9 by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising because the high galactic latitude lines of sight of our sample may have different physical conditions ( including cold / warm phase fraction ) than the ones used to derive the relation .",
    "similarly , without considering these properties in detail , such relations will not be readily useful in estimating the sfr for the high redshift dlas as well .",
    "it has been earlier established by @xcite that the wim is one of the major ism components along high galactic latitude lines of sight with c  ii@xmath3 absorption .",
    "the current study establishes from direct h  i observations that the lines of sight certainly pass through a non - negligible fraction of cnm , coexisting in the same velocity range as that of the c  ii@xmath3 absorption . computing the sfr , assuming the ism to be in the warm phase ( without taking the cnm fraction into consideration ) , results in a higher value of @xmath9 .",
    "however , even after including the cnm fraction in the calculation , the median value of @xmath9 is more than a factor of three higher than the average sfr of the milky way .",
    "this mismatch is not surprising because , in our simplified order of magnitude calculation of the sfr , we have neglected the wim component which is likely to contain a significant fraction of the observed c  ii@xmath3 column density @xcite . also , the derived values of @xmath9 vary by a factor of about @xmath98 for different lines of sight .",
    "earlier studies have suggested a correlation between [ c  ii ] luminosity and the sfr both at galaxy scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as at smaller scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but , it is also well - known that the scatter in this relation is fairly large ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a sample of galaxies , @xcite found that the data are consistent with c  ii primarily being associated with cold ism ; @xcite found only @xmath99 of the c  ii to be from ionized gas in the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , concluded that multiple ism components significantly contribute to the [ c  ii ] luminosity of the milky way disk ( but also see @xcite who concluded that , in the galactic plane , c  ii has the same filling factor as that of the cnm ) . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the [ c  ii ] luminosity  sfr scaling relation is different for different ism phases .",
    "this may be due to varying energetics , or different timescale of sfr that c  ii is sensitive to in these various phases ( see * ? ? ?",
    "when averaged over galaxy scale , this gives rise to the observed extra - galactic scaling .",
    "considering all these aspects , the large scatter in the derived @xmath9 for our sample is not surprising . also , instead of averaging over galactic scale , or restricting to the cnm dominated disk of the galaxy , here we are rather considering high galactic latitude lines of sight with larger wnm and wim fraction .",
    "so , in principle , a different n(c  ii ) - sfr relation for this sample is quite possible .",
    "there are two more possible reasons for the large scatter in estimated values of @xmath9 for this sample .",
    "the galactic value of @xmath100 m@xmath81 yr@xmath21 kpc@xmath82 @xcite is only an average value over the entire extent of the disk . in reality , there is spatial variation of the sfr @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is related to the basic assumption of the thermal steady state itself .",
    "recently , theoretical as well as observational studies have raised doubts on the validity of the steady state model itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are evidences that much of the `` warm gas '' is in the so - called unstable phase with temperature lower than the wnm temperature of the classical model .",
    "more detailed studies are necessary to understand how this may affect the [ c  ii ] luminosity  sfr scaling relation .",
    "_ what are the possible connections of these results with the sfr for the dlas _ ?",
    "it is indeed true that , for the dlas , the cii cooling rate is not entirely balanced by the background radiation only , and requires contribution from a local radiation field which , in turn , is related to the star formation in these systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly , the c  ii cooling rate itself shows a bimodal distribution .",
    "this is proposed to be related to the mode of heating - _ in situ _ star formation for the ` low cool ' population ( cooling rate @xmath101 ergs  s@xmath21  h@xmath21 ) , and the star formation in the central lyman break galaxy for the ` high cool ' population @xcite . however , to estimate the sfr , the cold fraction of the gas along the line of sight still remains an important parameter ( particularly for the low cool systems ) . as shown here , for the sample of these dla - like lines of sight ,",
    "the inferred sfr is not a good estimator of the galactic average value of the true @xmath9 without a proper characterization of the phases of the ism in consideration .",
    "hence , a more detailed analysis of the energetics of the individual systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as direct and unambiguous measurements of the temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is necessary to get a handle on the issue ( please also see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion ) .",
    "as the [ c  ii ] fine structure transition is one of the main cooling mechanisms in the ism , the observed c  ii column density is often used , for local and high redshift systems ( including dlas ) , to infer the sfr . here",
    ", we have used radio and uv data to study the galactic ism along a sample of high galactic latitude `` dla - like '' sightlines with c  ii@xmath3 absorption .",
    "the h  i 21 cm absorption and emission spectra were used to directly constrain the temperature of the gas along these lines of sight . a good fraction ( @xmath102 ) of the neutral gas , even for these high latitude lines of sight",
    ", is in the cold phase .",
    "the correlation of the c  ii@xmath3 column density is tighter with the total h  i column density ( compared to that with only the cold or the warm gas column density ) .",
    "this suggests that c  ii is coexisting with both the cnm and the wnm .",
    "the derived sfr values , with the assumption that the [ c  ii ] fine structure cooling is important only in either the cold _ or _ the warm phase , do not match with the known value of the galactic sfr .",
    "we conclude that c  ii may not be a reliable tracer of star formation without adequate constraints on the temperature of the gas where the cooling is happening .",

    "<S> the far - infrared [ c  ii ] 158 @xmath0 m fine structure transition is considered to be a dominant coolant in the interstellar medium . for this reason , under the assumption of a thermal steady state </S>",
    "<S> , it may be used to infer the heating rate and , in turn , the star formation rate in local , as well as in high redshift systems . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> radio and ultraviolet observations of the galactic interstellar medium are used to understand whether c  ii is indeed a good tracer of the star formation rate . for a sample of high galactic latitude sightlines , direct measurements of the temperature </S>",
    "<S> indicate the presence of c  ii in both the cold and the warm phases of the diffuse interstellar gas . </S>",
    "<S> the cold gas fraction ( @xmath1 of the total neutral gas column density ) is not negligible even at high galactic latitude . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , to correctly estimate the star formation rate , c  ii cooling in both the phases should hence be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the simple assumption , that the [ c  ii ] line originates only from either the cold _ or _ the warm phase , significantly underpredicts or overpredicts the star formation rate , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these results are particularly important in the context of the damped lyman-@xmath2 systems for which a similar method is often used to estimate the star formation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the derived star formation rates in such cases may not be reliable if the temperature of the gas under consideration is not constrained independently . </S>"
