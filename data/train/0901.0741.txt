    "the existence of glueballs is an archetypal prediction of qcd as a confining theory . despite a great deal of experimental and theoretical efforts in the last 3 decades",
    ", there is still no any compelling evidence for their existence .",
    "surely , there are good glueball candidates , such as @xmath0 and @xmath11 which are seen copioursly in @xmath6 radiative decays and yet not observed in @xmath12 reactions  @xcite .",
    "however , definitive identification has been plagued by the complication that the branching ratios of these candidates in the radiative decay of @xmath6 , once thought to be the defining channel to probe the glue - rich content of the mesons , are not orders of magnitude large than the other known @xmath14 mesons , that the glueball can mix with ordinary mesons , and the fact that the statistics in experiments are neither high enough to confidently detect all the major decay channels nor precise enough to disentangle from the near - by states such as @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this case , the supplemental information on the quark content ( or rather the lack of ) via the @xmath12 coupling and leptonic decays prove to be important to reveal the nature of the glueball candidates .",
    "it is generally believed that the scalar glueball is hidden itself somewhere in the isosinglet scalar mesons with masses above 1 gev .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "many scalar mesons with masses lower than 2 gev have been observed and they can be classified into two nonets : one nonet with mass below or close to 1 gev , such as @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 that are generally believed to be composed of four quarks and the other nonet with mass above 1 gev such as @xmath20 , @xmath3 and two isosinglet scalar mesons .",
    "this means that not all three isosinglet scalars @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 can be accommodated in the @xmath21 nonet picture .",
    "one of them should be primarily a scalar glueball .    among the isosinglet scalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it has been quite controversial as to which of these is the dominant scalar glueball .",
    "it has been suggested that @xmath1 is primarily a scalar glueball @xcite , due partly to the fact that @xmath1 , discovered in @xmath22 annihilation at lear , has decays to @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are relatively large compared to that of @xmath25  @xcite and that the earlier quenched lattice calculations  @xcite predict the scalar glueball mass to be around @xmath26 mev .",
    "furthermore , because of the small production of @xmath25 in @xmath0 decay compared to that of @xmath27 , it has been thought that @xmath0 is primarily @xmath28 dominated .",
    "in contrast , the smaller production rate of @xmath27 relative to @xmath25 in @xmath2 decay leads to the conjecture that @xmath2 is governed by the non - strange light quark content .    based on the above observations ,",
    "a flavor - mixing scheme is proposed @xcite to consider the glueball and @xmath21 mixing in the neutral scalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "best @xmath29 fits to the measured scalar meson masses and their branching ratios of strong decays have been performed in several references by amsler , close and kirk  @xcite , close and zhao  @xcite , and he _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "a typical mixing matrix in this scheme is @xcite @xmath30 a common feature of these analyses is that , before mixing , the @xmath31 mass @xmath32 is larger than the glueball mass @xmath33 which , in turn , is larger than the @xmath34 mass @xmath35 , with @xmath33 close to 1500 mev and @xmath36 of the order of @xmath37 mev .",
    "other scenarios also have been proposed .",
    "for example , based on their lattice calculations of the quenched scalar glueball mass , lee and weingarten  @xcite considered a mixing scheme where @xmath1 is an almost pure @xmath31 meson and @xmath0 and @xmath2 are primarily the glueball and @xmath38 meson respectively , but with substantial mixing between the two ( @xmath39 for the small component ) . with the effective chiral lagrangian approach , giacosa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a fit to the experimental masses and decay widths of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and found four possible solutions , depending on whether the direct decay of the glueball component is considered .",
    "in spit of different opinions in the community on the identification of the scalar glueball , particle data group @xcite tried to conclude the status as ",
    "experimental evidence is mounting that @xmath1 has considerable affinity for glue and that the @xmath2 and @xmath0 have large @xmath40 and @xmath28 components , respectively \" .",
    "however , there are at least four serious problems with the above scenario : ( i ) the isovector scalar meson @xmath3 is now confirmed to be the @xmath14 meson in the lattice calculation  @xcite . as such , the degeneracy of @xmath3 and @xmath20 , which has a strange quark , can not be explained if @xmath32 is larger than @xmath35 by @xmath41 mev .",
    "( ii ) the most recent quenched lattice calculation with improved action and lattice spacings extrapolated to the continuum favors a larger scalar glueball mass close to 1700 mev  @xcite .",
    "( iii ) if @xmath0 is dominated by the @xmath28 content , the decay @xmath42 is expected to have a rate larger than that of @xmath43 .",
    "experimentally , it is other way around : the rate for @xmath4 production is about 6 times that of @xmath42 .",
    "( iv ) it is well known that the radiative decay @xmath44 is an ideal place to test the glueball content of @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath1 has the largest scalar glueball component , one expects the @xmath46 decay rate to be substantially larger than that of @xmath47 .",
    "again , experimentally , the opposite is true . simply based on the above experimental observations",
    ", one will naively expect that @xmath48 in the wave function of @xmath49 .",
    "in our recent work @xcite , we have employed two simple and robust results as the input for the mass matrix which is essentially the starting point for the mixing model between scalar mesons and the glueball .",
    "first of all , we know empirically that flavor su(3 ) is an approximate symmetry in the scalar meson sector above 1 gev .",
    "the near degeneracy of @xmath20 , @xmath50 , and @xmath1 has been observed . in the scalar",
    "charmed meson sector , @xmath51 and @xmath52 have similar masses even though the former contains a strange quark .",
    "it is most likely that the same phenomenon also holds in the scalar bottom meson sector .",
    "this feature is also confirmed by the quenched lattice calculation of the masses for the isovector scalar meson @xmath53 and the axial - vector meson @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "it is found that , when the quark mass is smaller than that of the strange , @xmath53 mass is almost independent of the quark mass , in contrast to those of @xmath54 and other hadrons that have been calculated on the lattice ( see fig .",
    "this explains the fact that @xmath55 is basically degenerate with @xmath3 despite having one strange quark .",
    "this unusual behavior is not understood as far as we know and it serves as a challenge to the existing hadronic models . in any case , these lattice results hint at an su(3 ) symmetry in the scalar meson sector .",
    "second , an improved quenched lattice calculation of the glueball spectrum at the infinite volume and continuum limits based on much larger and finer lattices have been carried out  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the scalar glueball is calculated to be @xmath56 mev .",
    "this suggests that @xmath33 should be close to 1700 mev rather than 1500 mev from the earlier lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "we shall use @xmath57 to denote the quarkonium states @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and @xmath60 to denote the pure scalar glueball state . in this basis",
    ", the mass matrix reads @xmath61 where the parameter @xmath62 denotes the mixing between different @xmath14 states through quark - antiquark annihilation and @xmath63 stands for the glueball - quarkonia mixing strength .",
    "possible su(3 ) breaking effects are characterized by the subscripts  @xmath64 \" and  @xmath65 \" .",
    "as noticed in passing , lattice calculations  @xcite of the @xmath3 and @xmath20 masses indicate a good su(3 ) symmetry for the scalar meson sector above 1 gev .",
    "this means that @xmath32 should be close to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "also the glueball mass @xmath33 should be close to the scalar glueball mass @xmath68 mev from the lattice qcd calculation in the pure gauge sector @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering exact su(3 ) symmetry as a first approximation , namely , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this case ,",
    "two of the mass eigenstates are identified with @xmath3 and @xmath1 which are degenerate with the mass @xmath72 .",
    "taking @xmath72 to be the experimental mass of @xmath73 mev @xcite , it is a good approximation for the mass of @xmath1 at @xmath74 mev @xcite .",
    "thus , in the limit of exact su(3 ) symmetry , @xmath1 is the su(3 ) isosinglet octet state @xmath75 and is degenerate with @xmath3 . in the absence of glueball - quarkonium mixing , i.e. @xmath76 , @xmath2 becomes a pure su(3 ) singlet @xmath77 and @xmath0 the pure glueball @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath2 mass is given by @xmath78 .",
    "taking the experimental @xmath2 mass to be @xmath79 mev , @xmath62 is found to be @xmath80 mev . when the glueball - quarkonium mixing @xmath63 is turned on",
    ", there will be some mixing between the glueball and the su(3)-singlet @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath63 has the same magnitude as @xmath62 , the mass shift of @xmath2 and @xmath0 due to mixing is only of order 10 mev , a feature confirmed by the lattice calculation @xcite .    as discussed before ,",
    "su(3 ) symmetry leads naturally to the near degeneracy of @xmath3 , @xmath20 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , in order to accommodate the observed branching ratios of strong decays , su(3 ) symmetry must be broken to certain degree in the mass matrix and/or in the decay amplitudes .",
    "one also needs @xmath81 in order to lift the degeneracy of @xmath3 and @xmath1 . since the su(3 ) breaking effect",
    "is expected to be weak , they will be treated perturbatively .    if @xmath0 is primarily a pseudoscalar glueball , it is naively expected that @xmath82 after phase space correction due to the flavor independent coupling of @xmath7 to @xmath83 .",
    "however , experimentally there is a relatively large suppression of @xmath25 production relative to @xmath27 in @xmath0 decay .",
    "to explain the large disparity between @xmath25 and @xmath27 production in scalar glueball decays , chanowitz @xcite advocated that a pure scalar glueball can not decay into quark - antiquark in the chiral limit , i.e. @xmath84 . since the current strange quark mass is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath85 and @xmath86 , decay to @xmath27 is largely favored over @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that chiral suppression will manifest itself at the hadron level  @xcite . to this end , it has been suggested @xcite that @xmath87 should be interpreted as the scale of chiral symmetry breaking since chiral symmetry is broken not only by finite quark masses but is also broken spontaneously .",
    "consequently , chiral suppression for the ratio @xmath88 is not so strong as the current quark mass ratio @xmath89 .",
    "guided by the lattice calculations for chiral suppression in @xmath90 @xcite , we have performed a best @xmath29 fit to the measured masses and branching ratios .",
    "the mixing matrix obtained in our model has the form : @xmath91 it is evident that @xmath0 is composed primarily of the scalar glueball , @xmath1 is close to an su(3 ) octet , and @xmath2 consists of an approximate su(3 ) singlet with some glueball component ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "unlike @xmath2 , the glueball content of @xmath1 is very tiny because an su(3 ) octet does not mix with the scalar glueball .",
    "because the @xmath93 content is more copious than @xmath28 in @xmath0 , it is natural that @xmath94 has a rate larger than @xmath42 .",
    "our prediction of @xmath95 is consistent with the observed value of @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath0 is composed mainly of the scalar glueball , it should be the most prominent scalar produced in the radiative @xmath6 decay .",
    "hence , it is expected that @xmath97 , a relation borne out by experiment .",
    "finally , we remark that in our mixing model , the relative @xmath98 coupling strength is @xmath99 .",
    "hence @xmath1 has the smallest @xmath98 coupling of the three states even though it has the least glue content in our model .",
    "therefore , the fact that @xmath1 has not been seen in @xmath12 reactions does nt necessarily imply its glueball content .",
    "in 1980 , mark ii observed a resonance with a mass around 1440 mev in the radiative @xmath6 decay @xcite and identified it with the @xmath100 meson first discovered at cern in 1963 through @xmath101 interactions @xcite .",
    "it was then realized that the new state observed by mark ii was not @xmath100 and was subsequently named @xmath102 by mark ii and crystal ball collaborations @xcite .",
    "shortly after the mark ii experiment , @xmath102 now known as @xmath11 was proposed to be a leading candidate for the pseudoscalar glueball .",
    "( for an excellent review of the @xmath103 and @xmath104 mesons , see @xcite . )",
    "indeed @xmath11 behaves like a glueball in its productions and decays because it has a large production rate in the radiative @xmath6 decay and is not seen in @xmath12 reactions . besides @xmath11 , other states with masses below 2 gev",
    "have also been proposed as the candidates , such as @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "however , the pseudoscalar glueball interpretation for @xmath11 is not favored by most of the theoretical calculations .",
    "for example , quenched lattice gauge calculations predict the mass of the @xmath107 state to be above 2 gev in @xcite and around 2.6 gev in @xcite .",
    "it is not favored by the sum - rule analysis with predictions higher than 1.8 gev @xcite either .",
    "hence , we are encountering an embarrassing situation that although experimentally @xmath11 is a favored candidate for the pseudoscalar glueball , theorists seem to prefer to have a @xmath107 state heavier than the scalar glueball .",
    "the motivation of our recent work @xcite is to see if we can learn something about the glueball mass by studying the @xmath108 mixing .",
    "the @xmath109 mixing has been well studied by feldmann , kroll and stech @xcite .",
    "we extend the fks formalism to include the pseudoscalar glueball @xmath7 . in the fks scheme , the conventional singlet - octet basis and the quark - flavor basis",
    "have been proposed . for the latter ,",
    "the @xmath110 and @xmath28 flavor states , labeled by the @xmath111 and @xmath112 mesons , respectively , are defined .",
    "the physical states @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 are related to the octet , singlet , and unmixed glueball states @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively , through the combination of rotations @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the @xmath109 mixing angle in the octet - singlet basis , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the mixing angle between @xmath7 and @xmath114 ; that is , we have assumed that @xmath113 does not mix with the glueball .",
    "we proceed to define decay constants for the physical and flavor states @xmath121 the decay constants associated with the @xmath8 meson , @xmath9 meson , and the physical glueball are related to those associated with the @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath115 states via the same mixing matrix @xmath122    sandwiching the equations of motion for the anomalous ward identity @xmath123 between vacuum and @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath60 , we derive @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 with the abbreviation @xmath129",
    "now we have six equations for many unknowns .",
    "hence we have to reply on the large @xmath130 counting rules @xcite @xmath131 to solve the equations step by step .    to the leading order of @xmath132 expansion",
    ", we shall keep the decay constants @xmath133 and @xmath134 and neglect @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 as they are suppressed by @xmath138 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "likewise , we can just retain the diagonal mass terms @xmath139 , @xmath140 and neglect other off - diagonal mass terms .",
    "it turns out that the ratio of the last two equations in the third low of eq .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) yields @xmath141 where @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) is the shorthand notation for @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) and similarly for others .",
    "_ this simple equation tells us that the pseudoscalar glueball mass @xmath146 can be determined provided that the mixing angle @xmath120 and the ratio @xmath147 are known . _ note that the @xmath120 dependence appears at order of @xmath148 for small @xmath120 .",
    "so the solution for @xmath146 is stable against the most uncertain input @xmath120 .    the mixing angles @xmath149 and @xmath120 have been measured recently from the @xmath150 decays by kloe @xcite .",
    "using the decay constants @xmath151 and @xmath152 as inputs @xcite , kloe obtained the angles @xmath153 and @xmath154 inferred from the relevant data . in @xcite the data of @xmath155 and @xmath156 were first considered and the fit gave the outcomes @xmath157 and @xmath158 . without precise inputs of @xmath133 and @xmath134",
    "it is not unexpected to get a wide range for @xmath120 .",
    "since @xmath120 has a wide range , the results @xmath159 and @xmath160 also have larger errors . using the central values of @xmath147 and @xmath120 from @xcite as inputs ,",
    "we derive the pseudoscalar glueball mass from eq .",
    "( [ rg ] ) to be @xmath161 the proximity of the predicted @xmath146 to the mass of @xmath11 and other properties of @xmath11 make it a very strong candidate for the pseudoscalar glueball .",
    "our next task is to check the stability and robustness of our prediction when higher order effects in @xmath132 are included .",
    "we first turn on the decay constants @xmath135 and",
    "@xmath136 , @xmath137 . assuming flavor - independent couplings between the glueball @xmath115 and the pseudoscalar @xmath162 and @xmath31 states , we then have the relations @xmath163 it turns out that the above simple formula eq .",
    "( [ rg ] ) still holds even after keeping the ozi - correcting decay constants , as long as they obey eq .",
    "( [ fg ] ) .",
    "[ tab:2 ]    finally we turn on the mass term @xmath164 and neglect @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "it is justified to do so because @xmath165 is proportional to the light @xmath168 quark mass , while the last two mass terms are @xmath138 suppressed relative to @xmath164 . to explore the impact of @xmath164 on our solutions , we add @xmath134 as an input so that @xmath164 can be introduced as an unknown .",
    "the results for the various inputs of @xmath169-@xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and @xmath173 gev@xmath174 are listed in table  [ tab:2 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath164 and @xmath146 do depend on @xmath134 sensitively . in some cases",
    ", we have @xmath146 as large as 1.84 gev and 2.15 gev , for which @xmath164 are negative and large .",
    "we can not discard these solutions of @xmath164 _ a priori _ , but they are not favored due to their negative values .",
    "this issue can be sorted out , when lattice calculations of @xmath164 with dynamical fermions are available .",
    "therefore , if excluding the solutions with large and negative @xmath164 , the range @xmath175 gev of the pseudoscalar glueball mass obtained in eq .",
    "( [ mg ] ) will be more or less respected",
    ".    one may feel rather uncomfortable with our solution for @xmath146 as both lattice qcd and qcd sum rules indicate a pseudoscalar glueball heavier than the scalar one .",
    "the point is that lattice calculations so far were performed under the quenched approximation without the fermion determinants .",
    "it is believed that dynamical fermions will have a significant effect in the pseudoscalar channel , because they raise the singlet would - be - goldstone boson mass from that of the pion to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , it has been argued that the pseudoscalar glueball mass in full qcd is substantially lower than that in the quenched approximation @xcite . in view of the fact that the topological susceptibility is large ( of order @xmath176 ) in the quenched approximation , and",
    "yet is of order @xmath177 in full qcd and zero in the chiral limit , it is conceivable that full qcd has a large effect on the pseudoscalar glueball as it does on @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    according to our analysis , the @xmath178 decay width is 0.6 - 3 kev , and the leptonic decays @xmath179 are very small @xcite .",
    "both predictions can be confronted with future experiments .",
    "there may not exist a unique feature which tells a glueball apart from a quark - antiquark state .",
    "we need to combine information from @xmath6 radiative decays , hadronic decays , as well as @xmath12 and leptonic decays as advocated in @xcite .",
