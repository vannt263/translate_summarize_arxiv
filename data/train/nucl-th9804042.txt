    "we will show how to construct a solution for a light cone potential of the form @xmath163 we will then show how to convert this solution into that for the singular gauge and how this problem in singular gauge translates into a boundary condition on the dirac wavefunction at @xmath114 . in the text , we will use this to construct solutions across the boundaries at @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that for @xmath67 , we are given a plane wave solution of the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 is a polarization label on the electron spinor . at @xmath66 ,",
    "the solution must be a linear combination of plane wave solutions to the dirac equation modulo a gauge rotation @xmath166 where @xmath167 the integral above is two dimensional since @xmath168 labels the solution on both sides of the boundary as the potential is @xmath84 independant , and because the value of plus component of light cone momenta is determined by the mass shell condition .",
    "what are the boundary conditions at @xmath114 ?",
    "recall that the form of the dirac equation is @xmath169 where @xmath170 are the projection operators described in the last appendix . here",
    "@xmath171 is the covariant momentum operator .",
    "we see there for the @xmath117 can be chosen to be continuous across the boundary . on the other hand , the plus component of the wavefunction must be discontinuous since by the dirac equation @xmath172 and the covariant momentum operator contains the vector potential which is discontinuous .",
    "this tells us what the proper boundary condition is in singular gauge .",
    "recall that to transform between the two gauges @xmath173 we therefore have that the boundary condition in singular gauge is the the component @xmath174 with the plus components determined by the dirac equation .",
    "all components of the wavefunction in singular gauge are therefore discontinuous .",
    "it is now straightforward to determine the solution for @xmath66 .",
    "consider @xmath175 where @xmath176 again @xmath177 it is easy to see that this function solves the dirac equation . at @xmath114 ,",
    "the term involving @xmath106 disappears so that the integrals over @xmath178 and @xmath179 can be done with the result @xmath180 using the definition of the projection operators @xmath170 , and the relationship between @xmath181 , this is just @xmath182 . to derive this",
    ", we must use the definition of the vector potential in terms of @xmath183 .",
    "this solution therefore solves the boundary conditions .",
