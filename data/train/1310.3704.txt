    "a general molecular scale theory of crystallization that describes elastic and plastic deformations , including phonons , translation / rotation of the crystallites , and crack propagation is yet unavailable .",
    "practical problems , like dendrite fragmentation or a realistic model of defect dynamics in crystals would require such a tool . despite recent steps made in this direction ,",
    "further work is needed .",
    "the advanced models developed in the past years are based on various formulations of the classical density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , such as the perturbative approach by ramakrishnan and yussouff @xcite , the non - perturbative theories like the weighted and modified weighted density approximations @xcite , and ultimately the fundamental measure theory @xcite , followed by the recently proposed simple phase - field crystal ( pfc ) model @xcite .",
    "the dft models characterize the local state of the matter by the time averaged one - particle density of which the free energy is a unique functional .",
    "the dynamic extensions of the dft , termed dynamic density functional theories ( ddfts ) , address a great variety of crystallization related time dependent problems @xcite , including grain boundary dynamics , homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation , dendritic and eutectic growth , density- or solute trapping , freezing of competing crystalline phases , etc . @xcite .",
    "the dynamic extension of the dft even for simple atomic liquids is a rather demanding problem of non - equilibrium statistical physics , posing a number of difficulties @xcite .",
    "first the ddft was worked out for strongly non - equilibrium brownian liquids and colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "later the dynamics was extended for dense atomic liquids @xcite .",
    "the unified dynamics derived for both molecular and colloidal fluids @xcite is a recent development , but it is valid only for small velocities ( i.e. for dense liquids and/or close to equilibrium ) . the first time derivative in the dynamical equation originates from the presence of a medium , which is responsible for the damping . in the case of simple molecular liquids no medium is present , thus the velocity field can not be neglected anymore .",
    "some of the dynamic extensions to crystals rely on a purely diffusive dynamics ( overdamped , conservative kinetic equation yielding diffusive dynamics , more appropriate for colloidal suspensions than anything else , e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas other models incorporate a second order time derivative in the kinetic equation @xcite , which may lead to the appearance of a second time scale resembling relaxation .",
    "a third category is the linearized hydrodynamic model that would capture phonons in the crystal @xcite .",
    "however , only a few limited studies of the latter kind have been performed @xcite , in which the form of the associated phonon dispersion has not been tested .",
    "a few other attempts have recently been made to couple fluid flow and the pfc model .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple advected pfc model to describe particle motion in a carrier fluid . a navier - stokes - cahn - hilliard model has been coupled with the pfc model to model jamming of phase separation by colloidal particles at the liquid - liquid interface @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , also lacks the fluid flow for the density field .",
    "the most essential problem of combining a molecular scale theory with hydrodynamics is that in the latter approach inertia and dissipation are formulated on the macroscopic level , which can not be easily reconciled with molecular scale modeling ( e.g. , the large density gradients in the microscopic picture should not create spurious mass flow inside the crystal ) . in this paper , we raise the idea that a straightforward resolution of this problem could be obtained via scale separation ; i.e. , by employing appropriately coarse - grained quantities in the navier - stokes equation .",
    "herein , we present a nonlinear hydrodynamic theory of crystallization in simple molecular liquids that naturally incorporates elasticity and plasticity including phonon dispersion , capillary waves , together with translation and rotation of the crystal embedded into the liquid .",
    "this is achieved by coupling the navier - stokes equation with classical density functional theories of crystallization via the coarse - grained density and velocity fields .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section 2 , we present the dynamical equations and the coupling between microscopic and macroscopic quantities on the basis of scale separation . to be able to address fluctuation phenomena ( such as capillary waves at the crystal - liquid interface ) , we start from fluctuating nonlinear hydrodynamics ( fnh ) , a field - theoretic approach that couples hydrodynamic fluctuations with the free energy @xcite .",
    "we then demonstrate the translational and rotational invariance of our model . in section 3",
    ", we apply our approach to a simple classical dft , the pfc model , and specify the respective model parameters for pure iron .",
    "section 4 deals with the dynamic response to elastic deformations , including compression , torsion and phonon spectrum , followed by results for front propagation for growth and melting , and the capillary wave spectrum .",
    "finally , a few technical remarks are made regarding coarse - graining applied in this work . in section 5 ,",
    "we offer a few concluding remarks .",
    "we present a time - dependent density functional theory of crystallization based on fluctuating nonlinear hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "our starting point is a recent work of shang _",

    "+ note that substituting the time derivative of equation ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) into the divergence of equation ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) , and using equation ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) yields the following kinetic equation : @xmath16 \\enskip , \\ ] ] which consistently recovers the _ undamped _ limit of the dynamics proposed by archer @xcite for small velocities ( @xmath17 ) in the case of @xmath18 .",
    "since in equation ( [ eq : arch ] ) @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the local time - averaged microscopic one - particle and momentum densities , respectively , the same applies for equations ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) .",
    "the main difficulties associated with applying the free energy functional of a classical dft of freezing _ directly _ in the dynamical equations ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) are as follows : ( i ) the validity limit of the navier - stokes equation coincides with that of the linear dissipation assumption . according to molecular dynamics simulations , the smallest length scale , where the navier - stokes equation is considered to be valid in liquids is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the effective molecular diameter @xcite . on smaller length scales ,",
    "the definition of the continuum velocity field breaks down , and the system shows an essentially different behavior ( in other words , the molecular resolution must be taken into account in both space and time ) .",
    "( ii ) in the classical dft of freezing , the crystal is represented by a lattice periodic density distribution , which shows peaks at the lattice sites . due to the high gradients of the density field ,",
    "expressing @xmath3 by @xmath2 and @xmath1 may lead to singularities in the velocity , yielding spurious convections in the interatomic space . to prevent such singularities while retaining the validity of the navier - stokes equation , we assume that the convection is related to the coarse - grained momentum and density fields as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 stand for the space- and time - averaged microscopic one - particle density and momentum fields , respectively , where the spatial averaging results in the fields _ without their lattice periodic components_. consequently , this phenomenological `` derivation '' relies on a two - step coarse - graining process .",
    "note that the shortest possible wavelength in @xmath24 , on which the navier - stokes equation is valid , corresponds to the thickness of the solid - liquid interface that should be several times the intermolecular distance , a condition not necessarily satisfied for faceted crystal - liquid interfaces .",
    "in addition , we apply the constant mobility approximation @xcite in equation ( [ eq : eq5 ] ) : @xmath25}{\\delta \\rho } \\enskip , \\ ] ] which corresponds to the trivial reversible stress tensor @xmath26/\\delta\\rho)\\mathbb{i}$ ] ( where @xmath27 is the identity matrix ) . the coarse - grained velocity can be generated by using different lowpass filters .",
    "the properties and the effect different filters will be discussed in section 4.5 .",
    "note that applying our approach to a simple ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type free energy functional ( where the preferred density field distributions are homogeneous ) , the coarse - graining process simply results in @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 [ if the characteristic length of the gl model ( i.e. the interface width ) is large compared to the interatomic distance ] . in this case , the model reduces to the description of shang et al .",
    "@xcite , but with constant mobility in the reversible stress .",
    "( since the gl models do not contain the elastic properties of the crystalline phase , the reduced model can be used only for liquid - liquid or liquid - vapor transitions . ) finally , we also mention that the present description is limited exclusively by the ratio of the interatomic distance and the interface thickness : the characteristic length scale on which the viscous dissipation acts must be large enough to retain the validity of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "molecular dynamics investigations along the line described in ref .",
    "@xcite are needed to clarify this limitation further .",
    "first we test our description against translational and rotational invariance .",
    "pure translation and/or rotation can be expressed by the velocity field @xmath31 , while the corresponding momentum distribution reads as @xmath32 . using equation ( [ eq : defvel ] )",
    "the coarse - grained velocity field is : @xmath33 where we utilized that the spectrum of @xmath34 contains only a zero - frequency component .",

    "using this together with @xmath32 and @xmath38 in equations ( [ eq : eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq : eq4 ] ) yields : @xmath39   & = & 0 \\\\ \\label{eq : simp2}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{p(\\mathbf{r},t)}}{\\partial t } + \\nabla \\cdot \\left [ \\mathbf{p}(\\mathbf{r},t ) \\otimes \\mathbf{v}_0(\\mathbf{r } ) \\right ] & = & 0 \\enskip , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used that @xmath40 and @xmath41\\}\\equiv 0 $ ] .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq : simp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : simp2 ] ) simply translate and rotate the initial density [ @xmath35 ] and momentum [ @xmath43 distributions .",
    "the novel scale separation method poposed here leads to the proper momentum equation in the long wavelength regime , while realizing wave dynamics for small wavelengths ( the latter is responsible for the kinetics of the periodic field , i.e. , freezing and melting ) .",
    "the frequency regimes are coupled via the nonlinear terms of the navier - stokes equation .",
    "the main advantages of the proposed dynamics to former descriptions are as follows : ( i ) as a direct consequence of the scale separation , the present formalism is independent from the particular choice of the free energy functional , and ( ii ) the elastic properties of the crystal are inherently incorporated into the classical dft free energy functional , while the macroscopic liquid viscosity is coupled only to the coarse - grained velocity field .",
    "in contrast , in case of hydrodynamics - coupled ginzburg - landau type or phenomenological phase - field models the elastic crystal behavior is simply replaced by rigid body motion , which is usually achieved by applying a phase state dependent viscosity in the dissipative term .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation violates both the linear dissipation approximation and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem at the interface .",
    "we have chosen the free energy functional of a simple classical dft , the phase - field crystal theory ( pfc ) @xcite to demonstrate the capabilities of our approach .",
    "variants of this pfc model have been successfully used to describe elastic interactions in the crystal @xcite , planar crystal front growth @xcite , faceting and branching during crystallization in colloidal systems @xcite , homogeneous @xcite and heterogeneous nucleation @xcite , multiple time scales during glass formation @xcite , or even solute trapping @xcite .",

    "( c ) coarse - grained density field corresponding to panel a.,title=\"fig : \" ]    finally , we explore how the results depend on the choice of the coarse - graining filter .",
    "evidently , the coarse - grained density ( and momentum ) must be flat in the bulk phases .",
    "the coarse - grained fields are generated by using the following convolution @xcite :    @xmath165    where @xmath166 can be either the density or the momentum fields , and @xmath167 is the kernel of the filter . in our calculations we used various lowpass filters .",
    "the spectral kernel of a generalized quasi - ideal lowpass filter reads as @xmath168\\}/2 \\enskip , \\ ] ] where @xmath169 is a small parameter .",
    "note that for @xmath170 this filter recovers the ideal lowpass filter : @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the heaviside function .",
    "another possible choice can be the gaussian filter , for which @xmath173 \\enskip , \\ ] ] where the real - space filtering length , @xmath174 ( i.e. the standard deviation ) , emerges from symmetry considerations as follows : the density can be approximated as @xmath175 \\enskip , \\ ] ] where we have a lattice periodic function ( plus a density gap @xmath176 ) modulated by the slowly varying envelope function @xmath177 [ as illustrated in figure 6(a ) ] , while the corresponding coarse - grained density reads as @xmath178 [ see figure 6(c ) ] .",
    "the slow variation of @xmath177 means that its spectrum decays relatively fast around @xmath179 . because of the discrete sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoapprox ] ) in the spectrum of the full density [ @xmath180 the spectrum of the envelope function [ @xmath181 is simply repeated around every reciprocal lattice vector [ see figure 6(b ) ] : @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the delta function .",
    "choosing one of the first reciprocal lattice vectors ( @xmath184 ) and taking the cross section of the spectrum at @xmath185 one can define the functions @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "if @xmath188 is a fast decaying function , then @xmath189 decays around @xmath190 and @xmath191 as @xmath192 and @xmath193 , respectively [ as indicated by the vectors in figure 6(b ) ] .",
    "therefore , the expected optimum spectral cutoff distance for the filters is at @xmath194 . in our case",
    "the density gap is @xmath195 , while the amplitude is @xmath196 , therefore , @xmath197 .",
    "although the approximation described above might seem to be too simple and rough , it has been verified numerically for the gaussian filter .",
    "we have investigated both @xmath189 and the coarse - grained density in the crystal as a function of the real space filtering length @xmath174 ( standard deviation ) for an equilibrium crystalline cluster .",
    "figure 7.a shows h(t ) for various filtering lengths @xmath198 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the spectrum is practically independent from @xmath174 . the best choice for @xmath174",
    "is then determined by the flatness of the coarse - grained density in the bulk crystal and the behavior of the solid - liquid interface [ see figure 7(b ) ] : if the filtering length is too large , the interface broadens ( e.g. , for @xmath199 and @xmath200 ) , since the filter smoothes the density .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath174 is too small ( e.g. , for @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) , significant periodic components appear in the bulk crystal . as indicated by figure 7(b ) , an optimum choice for the real - space filtering length can be @xmath203 , for which the spectral kernel of the gaussian filter cuts off for @xmath204 [ see figure 7(c ) ] .     and",

    "the problem with that filter has already been illustrated in figure 7(a ) : the spectrum decays exponentially around @xmath190 and @xmath191 , and there is no `` empty '' frequency range of finite size between them .",
    "unfortunately , the quasi ideal lowpass filters are not smoothing filters , rather they are developed to separate two distinct ( non - overlapping ) frequency regimes .",
    "therefore , the expected quality of the coarse - grained density is much worse in case of these filters , which also has been verified numerically [ see figure 7(d ) ] .",
    "consequently , in our simulations we used a gaussian filter with a filtering length @xmath203 , as indicated above .",
    "we have presented a nonlinear hydrodynamic density functional theory of crystallization .",
    "our work couples the classical density functional theory to the navier - stokes equation directly via a phenomenological coarse - graining technique that prevents velocity singularities in the interatomic space .",
    "the dynamical equations are fundamental and supplemented with momentum fluctuations emerging from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "the main virtue of the present model is that the elastic of the crystal and the liquid is incorporated consistently .",
    "this is demonstrated by illustrative simulations including dynamic response to elastic deformations , phonon spectrum and steady crystal growth / melting .",
    "in addition , the capillary wave spectrum and the anisotropy of the interfacial free energy are also in a good qualitative agreement with the results of atomistic simulations .",
