    "since its discovery in 1996,@xcite the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) exhibited by the pyrochlore compound tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 posed many interesting questions .",
    "first among them , whether a common fundamental mechanism could be responsible for the origin of cmr both in this compound and in the larger family of perovskite manganese oxides,@xcite which have different crystal structure and electronic properties . the recent appearance of cmr in other compounds with the pyrochlore crystal structure @xcite exhibiting long range ferromagnetic ordering , and the larger experimental background now existent , allow a better standpoint to approach the theoretical description of this compound .",
    "tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 undergoes a ferromagnetic transition with critical temperature@xcite @xmath4 125k ( also reported@xcite as 140k ) , below which temperature the compound exhibits long range ferromagnetic ordering and is metallic . a sharp decrease in resistivity with the development of spontaneous magnetization below @xmath5 , and the magnetoresistance maximum around @xmath5 with field induced magnetization , which are similar to those of cmr mn - perovskites , indicate that a strong coupling between transport and magnetism also exists in tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3.@xcite but important differences have been established with respect to the cmr perovskites , starting from its a@xmath2b@xmath2o@xmath3 `` pyrochlore '' crystal structure.@xcite no mn@xmath6 has been detected,@xcite so that the associated jahn - teller structural distortions@xcite as well as a possible double exchange ( de ) mechanism@xcite inducing ferromagnetism between mn@xmath6-mn@xmath7 pairs , studied in connection with cmr in perovskite manganites,@xcite are absent .",
    "the crystal structure is almost temperature independent around @xmath5 , no structural anomalies appear which could be associated with the change in magnetotransport properties , thus evidencing negligible spin - lattice correlations.@xcite structural analysis indicate negligible o deficiencies present@xcite in stoichiometric tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 , and recently specially synthesized tl@xmath8mn@xmath2o@xmath9 defect compounds show the development of spin - glass behavior subjacent to ferromagnetism.@xcite magnetization measurements for the stoichiometric compound have shown saturation values of e.g. @xmath10 2.59,@xcite 2.7,@xcite 2.8,@xcite 3 @xmath11,@xcite which are in general slightly lower than the 3@xmath12 expected for mn@xmath7 ions with a @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) configuration .",
    "hall experiments have indicated a very small number of high mobility electron - like carriers : @xmath150.001 - 0.005 conduction electrons per formula unit,@xcite differing notably with the hole - doped mn - perovskites where cmr appears around 30@xmath16 doping .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath17 has been reported to show a negative pressure dependence,@xcite again in contrast to cmr perovskites , though above 10 kbar a change of tendency and positive pressure shifts of @xmath17 in tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 have been reported.@xcite recently , also striking differences with the perovskites were reported for the evolution of the charge dynamics probed in optical conductivity measurements.@xcite experimental research of magnetotransport has also been actively pursued in other pyrochlore compounds where the ordered phase remains insulating,@xcite as well as in many obtained by substitutional doping of the diverse components of tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3.@xcite    the experimental results have received various interpretations and prompted different proposals and suggestions for the mechanism potentially involved in cmr in tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 since 1996 . already in refs .",
    "3 and 13 it was suggested that magnetism and transport seemed related primarily to two different subsystems , unlike de invoked for cmr perovskites : magnetism ( suggested to be possibly driven by superexchange@xcite ) involving mostly mn-@xmath18 and o orbitals , while transport would be mainly determined by carriers involving highly itinerant tl-@xmath19 orbitals mixed with oxygen.@xcite unusually large scattering from spin fluctuations accompanying the fm ordering in the presence of low carrier densities was suggested as explanation for cmr.@xcite electronic structure calculations@xcite for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 indicated that the bands immediately below the fermi level correspond mainly to mn-@xmath20 states , above the fermi level appear tl-@xmath19 bands , while o states are mixed with these around the fermi level .",
    "the band structure calculation by singh @xcite obtained a strong spin differentiation in the electronic structure around the fermi level in the ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "the majority spin mn-@xmath21o-@xmath22 bands below the fermi level are separated by a gap from the mn-@xmath23 derived bands , though there is also a mixing with tl and o states above and below the fermi level .",
    "thus a small near band edge fermi surface is obtained . for the minority channel instead , a highly dispersive band with a strong admixture of mn , tl and o",
    "was found around the fermi level , leading to a metallic minority spin channel.@xcite in ref .",
    "3 it was also mentioned that the hall data could result from a small number of carriers in the tl-@xmath19 band : assuming tl@xmath24tl@xmath25mn@xmath26mn@xmath27o@xmath1 with x@xmath15 0.005 the data could be accounted for , indicating a very small doping into the mn@xmath7 state.@xcite in 1997 , this proposal was explored in terms of an intermediate valence model ( ivm ) for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 by alascio and one of us ( c.i.v.).@xcite hall experiments @xcite and cmr results @xcite could be accounted for in the context of the strongly differentiated electronic structure obtained,@xcite with temperature and magnetic field changes which allowed explanations for the drastic carrier density changes which had been observed at @xmath5 in hall data,@xcite proposing the presence of a ( spin - dependent ) hybridization gap or pseudogap near the fermi level .",
    "it may be mentioned that while mn@xmath28 is a rarely found oxidation state for mn , in tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 it could effectively appear as a result of the strong hybridization of orbitals near the fermi level .",
    "furthermore , recently the presence of mn@xmath28 ions has been reported in cd - substituted samples ( tl@xmath8cd@xmath29mn@xmath0o@xmath1 ) together with mn@xmath7 ions,@xcite while in a different context mn@xmath28 in a tetrahedral environment has been found to exist in ba@xmath30mn@xmath0o@xmath31.@xcite    in 1998 , majumdar and littlewood @xcite explored the scenario of spin fluctuations around @xmath5 in presence of very low carrier densities proposed in refs .  3 and 13 , starting from the proposal of a microscopic model involving hund and superexchange coupling,@xcite and showing that spin polarons might form and provide an explanation for cmr . an electronic structure calculation by mishra and sathpathy@xcite in 1998 shows some common features with the ivm band structure : in the fm phase they mention the presence of a free - electron - like minority spin @xmath32 band crossing the fermi energy with highly mobile carriers .",
    "they relate this band to mn-@xmath20 and tl-@xmath19 orbitals hybridized with o , the mn-@xmath23 orbitals being higher in energy .",
    "the occupied majority - spin bands consist of a mn@xmath33/o band , and a small pocket of very heavy holes , unimportant for transport.@xcite they propose a ferromagnetic double exchange hamiltonian for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 with a very small number of @xmath32 zener carriers which align anti - parallel to the localized mn@xmath33 spins , including a weak af - superexchange interaction between the localized spins .",
    "recent optical conductivity measurements @xcite are consistent with the main features of the electronic structure calculations mentioned.@xcite recently , an explanation of the origin and pressure dependence of ferromagnetism has been put forward in terms of a conventional fm superexchange model,@xcite provided that the intra - atomic hund interactions in oxygen are also taken into account and the empty mn@xmath34 orbitals hybridize with the o and tl levels .    in this paper",
    "we aim to contribute to the understanding of cmr in tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 by presenting our investigation of the magnetic phase diagram and electronic structure of a generic model for the compound , which is based on the suggestions presented by many researchers proposing the presence of superexchange interactions ( of either sign ) between nearest neighbor mn@xmath7 ions,@xcite and the indications of previous band structure calculations.@xcite in section [ sec : model ] we introduce this generic model for tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3 , and make a brief presentation of the mean - field treatment that we have employed in our study .",

    "the generic model takes into account the now widely accepted fact that in this material transport and magnetism seem to be primarily related to different electronic orbitals , @xcite which we describe by two bands of different character which are hybridized .",
    "one band is mainly itinerant , and the other includes strong correlations , as we now describe .",
    "the correlated electrons appear forming a lattice of local magnetic moments , and also occupying a narrow band , which are coupled via a strong hund exchange interaction .",
    "this would correspond to the assumption that the local magnetic moments present in the material are due to mn@xmath7 ions , with occupied mn-@xmath20 orbitals which , however , due to their mixing with o orbitals below the fermi level , are not completely localized , giving rise to the narrow band .",
    "a hybridization exists between the correlated band and the mostly itinerant one , which is connected with the low lying conduction states involving tl@xmath35 orbitals and o levels ( eventually hybridized with the mostly empty mn-@xmath23 orbitals@xcite ) in accordance with most experimental suggestions mentioned above , band structure calculations,@xcite and the recent description of the pressure dependence of @xmath5 for various cmr pyrochlores.@xcite the possibility of a superexchange coupling between the localized spins being present is also considered.@xcite    concretely , the generic model that we have studied is described by the hamiltonian @xmath36 where : @xmath37    in this hamiltonian @xmath38 describes the band associated to the weakly ( here simplified as un- ) correlated carriers in tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , characterized by a hopping parameter @xmath39 between nearest neighbors , and a creation operator @xmath40 for an electron with spin @xmath41 in the respective wannier orbital centered on site @xmath42 .",

    "a fact worth noticing is a symmetry manifest in the mean - field hamiltonians ( eqs .",

    "we present phase - diagrams obtained for a range of electron fillings around @xmath102 , near the region of interest for the description of tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 as will be discussed shortly in connection with the electronic structure and occupation of the bands .",
    "first , we will discuss the phase - diagrams obtained including an antiferromagnetic superexchange ( se ) coupling between nearest neighbor spins , as some authors@xcite have suggested : @xmath103 .",
    "we can make a few general statements :    \\i ) for small enough hybridization ( e.g. @xmath104v ) no ferromagnetism is obtained for any finite value of af - superexchange in the large region of variation of the bandwidth ratio @xmath105 investigated ( @xmath106 ) for fillings around @xmath107 ;    \\ii ) at larger hybridization values ( e.g. , @xmath108v ) an interesting competition between af and f is obtained as a function of the parameters , including reentrant behavior as a function of @xmath105 . though antiferromagnetism widely dominates for @xmath109 , we also found that for weak af - superexchange , @xmath110 , pockets of ferromagnetism appear at small to intermediate values of @xmath105 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdn1](a ) we show how these fm pockets shift to larger @xmath105 values if the hybridization is increased .    larger electron fillings",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdn1](b ) ] increase the size of the ferromagnetic regions , which are now obtained also at smaller @xmath105 values ( narrower bare @xmath51 band ) . to exemplify the dependence of the phase diagram with electron filling at fixed hybridization we include fig .",
    "[ fig : pdv03 ] corresponding to hybridization @xmath111v , where the cases @xmath112 are shown .",
    "the effect of filling on the phase diagram is amplified for larger hybridization values .",
    "thus , varying the filling , in the presence of a hybridization large enough , and for a @xmath51 band relatively narrower than the @xmath47 band , we have demonstrated that ferromagnetism can be obtained from the hs model even in the presence of a ( weak ) af - superexchange(@xmath113 ) , as has been suggested before,@xcite the stability region growing with increasing hybridization .",
    "if the phase diagram in the presence of a weak fm superexchange interaction ( @xmath114 ) is now investigated , as proposed early on for this compound by many researchers,@xcite and later claimed to be effectively the case if a careful consideration of the effect of o - orbitals was undertaken,@xcite of course the ferromagnetic phase is favored .",
    "now much larger ranges of the bandwidth ratio @xmath105 correspond to ferromagnetic ground states , as can be appreciated in figs .",
    "[ fig : pdn1 ] and [ fig : pdv03 ] .",
    "the subtle interplay of the different parameters which has been shown to determine the magnetic ordering in the hs model , in particular needed to obtain a ferromagnetic ground state for example , can be quite easily understood if one analyzes the corresponding electronic band structure . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmbands ] , where we plot the density of states decomposed in terms of the original bands , we find that for the parameter ranges in which ferromagnetism is clearly stable for the hs model , strong spin differentiation exists in the electronic structure .",
    "a band gap connected to the majority - spin orbitals is present at the fermi level ( @xmath115 ) , while a finite density of states at @xmath115 is obtained mainly for the minority - spin conduction band @xmath116 . for the fillings which have been discussed above",
    ", the chemical potential of the system is located near a hybridization band gap edge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fmbands ] ) , providing occupation of the different orbitals in qualitative agreement with previous electronic structure calculations.@xcite these results are also interesting as they place us in an analogous scenario to that proposed in 1997 for this compound,@xcite when the ivm for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 was introduced and shown to provide an explanation for the results obtained in hall experiments and the colossal nature of the mr of the compound .",
    "the presence of the fermi level near band edges , e.g. of a hybridization gap or pseudogap , in a strongly spin differentiated electronic band structure , and especially the spin - dependent conduction band changes predicted as a function of temperature and magnetic field , were shown@xcite to originate drastic changes in the carrier concentration around @xmath5 which , in the absence of anomalous hall contributions , could be directly related to the measurements in hall experiments @xcite and explain them .",
    "the validity of the hall data analysis performed in ref .  23 has recently been confirmed by new experimental reports on hall and thermopower data over wider temperature and magnetic field ranges.@xcite in ref .",
    "14 the new hall data are successfully explained using the same approach of ref . 23 , and support the prediction of drastic carrier density changes near @xmath5 , related to conduction band changes due to the development of magnetization , as being the main sources for the observed magnetotransport properties.@xcite    due to the simple mean - field approximation adopted , only at low temperatures , when the system is fully polarized , are our phase diagram results trustful , and the electronic structure results suitable for comparison with those obtained before using the ivm.@xcite the effect of spin - polarization by the hund interaction is not correctly estimated here at higher temperatures , being included only through the mean field magnetization order parameters .",
    "in fact , an investigation of the critical temperatures obtained here also evidenced problems related to the inability of the mfa employed to treat adequately the strong hund correlations : the curie temperatures obtained are found to decrease as hybridization is increased ( which one would tend to connect with negative pressure coefficients for @xmath5 as experimentally observed @xcite ) even in cases for which the phase diagrams show a stabilization of ferromagnetic ordering with increase of the hybridization ( as we obtain for fillings @xmath117 ) .",
    "this seems caused by a spurious tendency to stabilize a local magnetization due to the mutual interaction between the localized spins and the @xmath51 electrons through their hund coupling , irrespective of the intersite interactions , due to the mean field approximation employed .",
    "thus , the shortcomings of the present treatment for all but the lowest temperatures prevent us from addressing here the interesting issue of the ability of the hs model to describe the effect of pressure on @xmath5 for different values of its parameters .",
    "the increase of spin disorder with temperature , and in particular the paramagnetic phase , should be much better described using the coherent potential approximation as in ref .",
    "23 for the ivm .",
    "we expect that such a treatment for the paramagnetic phase of the hund - superexchange model would allow us to exhibit similarities with the ivm electronic structure results above @xmath5 , like those shown to exist for the ferromagnetic phase in the present work , and to address other issues of interest outside the scope of the simple treatment presented in this work .",
    "increasing experimental evidence on magnetotransport in tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 points towards drastic changes in the carrier concentration around @xmath5 as being mainly responsible for its colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "the absence of anomalous contributions to the hall resistance has also recently been confirmed.@xcite since the nature of the carriers involved in magnetotransport has been established as free electron - like , there are now strong indications in favor of a direct relationship between drastic changes in the conduction band structure around @xmath5 and the observed magnetotransport properties",
    ".    a strongly spin - differentiated electronic band structure , with drastic changes in the conduction bands around the critical temperature , seems a natural way to explain such abrupt carrier concentration changes .",
    "the presence of hybridization gaps or pseudogaps which , depending on the spin orientation of the carriers , might change drastically at @xmath5 would allow for such a scenario .",
    "the present paper is a first approach to show how such a scenario , first proposed for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 in 1997 in connection with an intermediate valence model ( ivm ) introduced to describe cmr and hall data of the compound,@xcite can effectively also be realized starting from different microscopic models suggested for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 , involving hund and superexchange magnetic couplings , as well as hybridization effects.@xcite we have performed a detailed study of the stability of magnetically ordered phases obtained at low temperatures for various sets of parameters of a generic hund - superexchange model ( hs ) .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that the mn orbitals , besides providing localized magnetic moments , also show some degree of delocalization through hybridization with the other orbitals , thus yielding a narrow band strongly coupled to the localized moments via a hund coupling .",
    "this narrow band also shows strong hybridization with a broader conduction band , related to the carriers in the compound .",
    "the possibility of a superexchange interaction between the localized spins is also allowed for in the generic model , thereby including many of the proposals presented before for this compound .",
    "the electronic structure of the hs model was also investigated , obtaining for the ferromagnetic case a strong spin differentiation and the presence of a minority - spin metallic channel , thus exhibiting many similarities with the electronic structure derived from the ivm for this ordered phase .",
    "the simple mean - field approach adopted here is unsuitable to describe adequately the effects of the hund interaction as temperature is increased .",
    "this limits the validity of our results to temperatures well below the critical one",
    ". it also prevents us from discussing the ability of the hund - superexchange model to describe the pressure dependence@xcite of @xmath118 in its various parameter regimes .    nowadays the mechanism responsible for the long - range ferromagnetism experimentally observed in tl@xmath2mn@xmath2o@xmath3",
    "has not yet been conclusively identified .",
    "the results presented here , those obtained before with the ivm,@xcite as well as the conclusions of much recent experimental work mentioned here , seem to indicate that in fact , provided the transport remains metallic , the detailed model for the magnetism matters much less than the trend with carrier density , as has been pointed out before for tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite in fact , our magnetic phase diagram results show that , although a ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the mn localized moments might be necessary to explain ferromagnetism in the related insulating pyrochlores ( for example , where y or lu appear substituting tl ) , the enhanced stability of fm ordering in tl@xmath0mn@xmath0o@xmath1 can be connected to the presence of spin - polarized charge carriers and hybridization effects , in accordance with previous suggestions.@xcite careful analysis of spectroscopic experiments is needed to elucidate conclusively whether the drastic changes observed in carrier concentration are mainly related to magnetization - related changes of the conduction bands themselves and/or shifts of the conduction band edges.@xcite    we especially thank blas alascio for enlightening discussions , and acknowledge financial support from the argentina - brazil cooperation program secyt - capes br / a99-eiii18/00 .",
