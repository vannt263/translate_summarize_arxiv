    "since the egret detection of about 60 blazars ( bl lac objects and flat spectrum radio quasars , fsrq ) in @xmath5-rays ( mukherjee et al .",
    "1997 ) , the study of this class of objects has received renewed interest .",
    "a large fraction of the total power is in fact emitted in the @xmath5-ray band , which is therefore crucial to test different radiation models .",
    "the bright @xmath5-ray emission requires relativistic boosting ( e.g. dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) , confirming that the emission of blazars originates in relativistic jets .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of all observed blazars from radio to @xmath5-rays shows two broad peaks , believed to be produced by relativistic electrons in the jet via the synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) processes respectively .",
    "it has been suggested that the location of the synchrotron and ic peaks and the `` @xmath5-ray dominance '' ( i.e the luminosity ratio of the second to the first peak ) are related to the power of the source so that all blazars lie along a spectral sequence ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ; ghisellini et al 1998 ) .",
    "fsrqs have synchrotron and ic peaks located at lower energies and are more @xmath5-ray dominated than the less powerful bl lac objects .",
    "it is widely believed that the ic emission from fsrq is dominated by the scattering between high energy electrons and soft photons external to the jet ( ec ) .",
    "the latter ones may be produced by the accretion disk itself and be scattered / reprocessed in the broad line region ( blr ) ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) .",
    "however other sources of seed photons ( e.g. the synchrotron photons themselves , ssc ) could contribute in the soft - medium x - ray band .",
    "contributions due to other components , like direct synchrotron emission or the high energy tail of the blue bump , are also possible in the soft x - ray band . in the simplest case of a single ec component",
    ", the flat x - ray spectrum of fsrq represents the low energy side of the ic peak and therefore is due to _ low energy electrons _ scattering the externally produced photons .",
    "this spectral band gives then information on a part of the electron spectrum which , due to selfabsorption , is not accessible in the low frequency synchrotron component .",
    "the unprecedentedly wide band of _ beppo_sax ( from 0.1 up to 100 kev ) is optimal to study the connection between the x - ray and the @xmath5-ray continuum and constrain and disentangle different emission components . for these reasons we started a program to observe the brightest @xmath5-ray blazars .",
    "here we report results for three of them , namely 0836 + 710 , 1510 - 089 and 2230 + 114 . after a summary of previous observations for each source ( section 2 ) , we present the analysis of the",

    "vlbi observations show a compact core and ejections of components with superluminal motion , possibly connected to @xmath0-ray flares ( otterbein et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in the x - ray band 0836 + 710 has been observed by rosat and asca ( cappi et al .",
    "1997 ) . in both cases",
    "it showed a flat spectrum that , together with the steep @xmath0-ray emission seems to indicate ( as data are not simultaneous ) that the ic peak lies in the soft @xmath0-ray band .",
    "a deficit of soft photons ( @xmath6 kev ) was interpreted as evidence of absorption higher than the galactic one .",
    "moreover from a comparison of rosat and asca data ( cappi et al .",
    "1997 ) this absorption appeared to change by @xmath7 @xmath8 on a timescale of less than 2.6 years ( 0.8 yr in the quasar frame ) .",
    "recently malizia et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported the detection of 0836 + 710 by batse in the energy range 20 - 100 kev with a flat spectrum ( @xmath9=0.1 - 0.3 ) .",

    "it is a nearby highly polarized quasar ( hpq ) , which presents strong similarities with 3c273 . in particular",

    "1995 ) and asca ( singh , shrader & george 1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is very flat in the 2 - 10 kev band , while in the rosat band it is steeper , suggesting the possible presence of a spectral break around 1 - 2 kev .",
    "the exosat observation ( singh et al . 1990 ) showed the presence of a relatively strong iron line ( ew@xmath13800 ev ) , not detected in more recent observations with ginga and asca . + * 2230 + 114 * : this quasar has been observed several times with ginga ( lawson & turner 1997 ) , rosat ( brinkmann et al . 1994 ) and asca ( kubo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it shows a flat spectrum which extends smoothly into the soft @xmath0-ray band , as indicated by the osse data ( mcnaron - brown et al .",
    "1995 ) .",

    "kellermann et al .",
    "( 1962 ) classify 2230 + 114 as a classical gigahertz peaked source ( e.g. odea 1998 ) .",

    "the scientific payload of the italian - dutch x - ray satellite @xmath14sax ( see boella et al .",
    "1997 ) consists of four coaligned narrow field instruments ( nfis ) and two wide field cameras .",
    "two of the nfis use concentrators to focalize x - rays : the low energy concentrator spectrometer ( lecs ) has a detector sensitive to soft - medium x - ray photons ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) , while the medium concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) reveals photons in the energy range 1.3 - 10 kev .",
    "the phoswich detector system ( pds ) , sensitive from 12 up to 200 kev , consisting of four identical units , uses rocking collimators so as to monitor source and background simultaneously with interchangeable units .",
    "we will not consider here the fourth nfi , a high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( hpgspc ) .",
    "the _ beppo_sax journal of observations is reported in table 2 , with exposure times and observed count rates .",
    "the observation of 2230 + 114 consisted of 5 short pointings , separated by 1 - 2 days , while the others were continuous apart from gaps due to satellite constraints .",
    "none of the sources showed significant flux variations within the observations .",
    "we therefore obtained a cumulative spectrum for each source .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "beppo_sax spectral data using the standard software packages xselect ( v1.4 ) and xspec ( v10.0 ) and the september 97 version of the calibration files released by the @xmath14sax scientific data center ( sdc ) . from the event files we extracted the lecs and mecs spectra in circular regions centered around the source with radii of 8@xmath15 and 4@xmath15 respectively",
    "( see the sax analysis cookbook ) .",
    "the pds spectra extracted with the standard pipeline with the rise - time correction were directly provided by the @xmath14sax sdc .",
    "we used pds data rebinned with s / n@xmath16 .",
    "for the spectral analysis we considered the lecs data in the restricted energy range 0.1 - 4 kev , because of unsolved calibration problems at higher energies .",
    "background spectra extracted from blank field observations at the same position as the source were used .",
    "we fitted rebinned lecs , mecs and pds spectra jointly , allowing for two variable different normalization factors to take into account uncertainties in the intercalibration of different instruments ( see sax cookbook ) .    in the following subsections we report the analysis procedure for each object .",
    "the results of the spectral fits are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the total lecs+mecs+pds spectrum of 0836 + 710 is well described by a single absorbed power - law model , with a column density higher than the galactic value at the 99% confidence level ( see figs [ 0836_plnhfree ] and [ 0836_multi ] ) . assuming a model with fixed galactic absorption plus a free absorption at the redshift of the source ( the zwabs model of xspec ) we found that the required intrinsic column density is @xmath17 @xmath8 to the quasar rest frame .",
    "an alternative possibility is to model the spectrum with a broken power law .",
    "this gives an extremely flat low energy slope , with an acceptance probability equivalent to the single power law plus free absorption model .",
    "these results agree well with the findings of cappi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from asca data even at different flux levels ( see the discussion in sect .",
    "3.1.1 ) .",
    "the residuals of the fits ( see fig .",
    "[ [ 0836_plnhfree ] ] ) show an excess around 2 kev in the lecs data .",
    "this is just the expected energy of the redshifted fluorescence fe line at 6.4 kev .",
    "fixing the continuum parameters to the value given by the fit of lecs , mecs and pds data for a single power - law we tried to model the excess with an unresolved gaussian line with the energy as a free parameter .",
    "the fit converges to the right energy ( @xmath18 kev , ew@xmath19 ev ) , but the improvement in the @xmath20 is only marginal ( the @xmath21test gives a probability @xmath22 ) .",
    "no excess is present in the mecs spectra at the same energy , which however is near the low energy end of the mecs sensitivity band , fixed at 1.8 kev ( as indicated in the sax cookbook ) .",
    "we checked whether the feature could be due to extraction problems or contamination : indeed when extracting the lecs spectrum in a smaller region of 4 the residuals are less evident .",
    "we conclude that the emission feature is probably not real .      in fig .",
    "( [ 0836_multi ] ) we report the @xmath23photon index confidence contours of rosat , asca and @xmath14sax observations , while in fig .",
    "( [ 0836_nh ] ) we show the absorption column obtained from different observations as a function of the 0.1 - 2 kev flux . as noted above , the sax and asca confidence contours in fig .",
    "( [ 0836_multi ] ) are clearly consistent , implying an @xmath23 higher than galactic and a very flat continuum ( @xmath24 ) although the flux during the sax observation was larger than that measured by asca by a factor of 2 . on the contrary ,",
    "the rosat data indicate a steeper spectrum ( @xmath25 ) and do not require extra - absorption .",
    "in fact comparing the rosat and asca results cappi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) concluded that the intrinsic absorption had varied between the two observations .",
    "given the consistency of the asca and @xmath14sax results at different flux levels we believe that the discrepancies with the rosat results may be more plausibly explained by calibration problems of rosat ( see e.g. iwasawa , fabian & nandra 1999 ) .",
    "a fit over the whole range ( lecs+mecs+pds ) with a single absorbed power - law model , although statistically acceptable , produces evident excess residuals at low energies and in the pds band ( see fig .",
    "[ [ 1510 ] ] , upper panel ) . using a broken power law model , with the low energy photon index steeper than the high energy one ,",
    "we obtain a better fit and the low energy residuals disappear ( fig.[[1510 ] ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the significant improvement is confirmed by the @xmath21-test ( probability @xmath26 ) .",
    "moreover this model is consistent with both rosat and asca observations described in sect.1 , which show a large difference in the hard and soft spectral indices .",
    "the data are also consistent with a fit with a power law+black body model , the latter having a temperature @xmath27 kev ( @xmath28 , 56 d.o.f . ) .",
    "it is interesting to note here that a similar soft excess has been detected in 3c273 by exosat , rosat and @xmath14sax ( turner et al . 1990 ,",
    "leach , mchardy & papadakis 1995 , laor et al .",
    "1994 and grandi et al .",
    "1997 , but see haardt et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the fit of the three datasets ( lecs+mecs+pds ) with a broken power law and free intercalibration factors still gives an unacceptable value of the pds / mecs normalization : the best fit value is 1.84 , with a 90% level confidence range of 1.3 - 2.5 , while the usual value for the pds / mecs relative normalization is 0.85 ( 90% level confidence range of 0.770.93 , see sax cookbook ) .",
    "if we fix the normalization to 0.85 the pds data fall well above the mecs extrapolation ( see fig . [ [ 1510 ] ] ) . the reason for this discrepancy is possibly the contamination by another source which lies in the pds field of view ( we remind that the pds fov is quite large , @xmath29 deg ) . the rosat image centered on 1510 - 089 shows a very crowded field and in a radius of 40@xmath15 we found 6 - 7 sources with a rosat flux of 1/10 of the flux of 1510 - 089 .",
    "in fact it is possible that 1510 - 089 lies in a poor cluster ( see e.g. yee & ellingson 1993 ) .",
    "the integrated flux from these sources in the rosat band is @xmath302/3 of the flux from our target .",
    "since pks 1510 - 089 is intrinsically quite hard ( @xmath31 in the mecs range ) and taking into account that the pds effective area off axis is on average 1/2 of the on - axis area , this source complex can not contribute significantly in the hard band if it has an average spectral slope @xmath32 .",
    "however it is possible that one of these or other sources may be strongly obscured in the soft - medium x - ray band , giving rise to a significant contribution in the pds band despite its weakness in the rosat field .",
    "therefore we can not exclude that the pds excess is due to contamination from another object , although we are not able to identify it .",
    "using exosat data singh et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found the presence of a relatively strong fluorescence fe k@xmath33 line ( ew=800@xmath34400 ev ) , confirmed by sambruna et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . the residuals in fig.([1510 ] ) do not show evidence of this line : fixing the parameters of the continuum , the energy of the line and using a gaussian profile we found an upper limit to the intrinsic ew of @xmath35 ev , well below the value given by the exosat data , which refer to a similar intensity state .",
    "interestingly this upper limit is consistent with that found in 3c273 by grandi et al .",
    "1997 ( but see haardt et al 1998 ) .      for 2230 + 114",
    "we obtain a good fit of the lecs+mecs+pds spectra with a flat absorbed power - law model .",
    "there is no evidence for spectral breaks or steepening and the absorption column is consistent ( within 1@xmath36 ) with the galactic value ( see the fig .",
    "[ [ 2230_cont ] ] ) .",
    "the residuals do not show evidence of spectral features .",
    "using sax x - ray , quasi - simultaneous optical and historical data taken from the literature we have assembled the sed shown in figs [ [ 0836_sed ] ] , [ [ 1510_sed ] ] and [ [ 2230_sed ] ] ( see the figure captions for the references to the data ) . in each case",
    "the @xmath0-ray points are averages over the available observations as given in the 3rd egret catalog ( hartman et al .",
    "for the case of 2230 + 114 the available osse and comptel data are not shown since they partly overlap with the more accurate and simultaneous data from the pds .",
    "the simultaneous optical data were taken at the torino observatory with the 1.05 m reosc telescope .",
    "magnitude calibration was performed according to the photometric sequences in villata et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and raiteri et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray data clearly trace the low energy branch of the high energy component , whose peak frequency falls above 1 mev , as estimated using the egret data ( although not simultaneous ) .",
    "note that the position of the synchrotron peak is very uncertain , because of the poor coverage in the ir band .",
    "currently the broad band properties of quasar - like blazars are understood in the framework of the ec models . as suggested by the strong thermal features present in the optical - uv spectra ( e.g. the blue - bump , bright emission lines ) the quasar environment is rich in soft photons , produced by the accretion disk and/or by the blr . in these conditions , in the frame of the emitting source , the energy density of the external soft radiation @xmath37 can be much higher than the energy density of the synchrotron radiation , and therefore the ec emission can dominate over the ssc emission .",
    "+ the simplest scenario to account for the emission assumes a spherical homogeneous source filled by relativistic electrons and is fully specified by 9 parameters : the size of the emitting region , the doppler factor , the magnetic field , the energy density and the frequency @xmath38 of the external radiation field and the parameters of the electron distribution . as indicated by the spectral shape of the ic component , flat in x - rays and steep in @xmath5-rays , the latter can be approximated by a broken power - law , specified by two spectral indices , the break energy and the normalization .",
    "the observed sed in principle can yield 6 quantities , namely the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity , the ic peak frequency and luminosity and the spectral indices of the ic component ( directly connected to the indices of the electron distribution ) .",
    "it is worth anticipating that for these blazars the observed peak corresponds to the synchrotron selfabsorption frequency of the synchrotron component which is higher than the peak frequency corresponding to the unabsorbed spectrum .",
    "in addition to these 6 quantities the typical variability timescale can give an indication of the size of the source .",
    "also in specific sources ( e.g. 0836 + 710 ) it is possible to have information on the luminosity and the typical frequency of the external radiation field .",
    "if the size of the region where this radiation is diluted can be estimated ( e.g. with the @xmath39 relation for radio - quiet quasars , e.g. kaspi et al . 2000 ) , the total number of observational constraints ( 6 + 3 ) is equal to the number of parameters of the model which can therefore _ in principle _ be _ strongly constrained_.      in order to reproduce the observed seds we adopted the model described in ghisellini et al . ( 1998 ) : relativistic electrons with a power - law distribution above a minimum energy are continuously injected in a spherical emitting region with radius r , with a magnetic field intensity b and moving with bulk lorentz factor @xmath40 ( in the following we assume that the observing angle is @xmath41 and therefore @xmath42 ) .",
    "the injected electron distribution is characterized by the spectral index @xmath43 , the minimum lorentz factor of particles , @xmath44 , and the injected luminosity @xmath45 .",
    "electrons cool rapidly through synchrotron and ic losses reaching an equilibrium distribution , which is essentially a broken power - law with indices @xmath46 above the break at @xmath47 and @xmath48 below the break ( in the absence of escape , pair production and klein - nishina effects ) down to a minimum lorentz factor @xmath49 .",
    "the spectrum of the soft external photons is described by a black body with @xmath50 hz and luminosity @xmath51 diluted in a spherical region with radius @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 can be related to the luminosity observed from the disk by @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the fraction of disk luminosity reprocessed in the blr .",
    "we do not consider radiation coming directly from the accretion disk , which at distances involved here ( @xmath56 cm ) and for @xmath57 is strongly redshifted .",
    "the parameters required to reproduce the observed seds ( figs . [ [ 0836_sed ] ] , [ [ 1510_sed ] ] and [ [ 2230_sed ] ] ) are given in table 4 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the luminosity and size of the blr are consistent with the observed disk luminosity for @xmath58 and a size @xmath59 of a fraction of a pc .",
    "the size of the emitting region and the lorentz factor have been chosen so as to allow variability with a day timescale as often observed in @xmath60-rays .    in the sed model shown in figs .",
    "( [ 0836_sed ] ) , ( [ 1510_sed ] ) and ( [ 2230_sed ] ) the peak of the synchrotron component is determined by self - absorption .",
    "consequently at low frequencies the model has the standard self - absorbed spectrum with slope 5/2 .",
    "additional emission components from regions further out in the jet are necessary to account for the spectra at lower frequencies , as indeed expected if the flat radio spectra of blazars are due to the superposition of different selfabsorbed components from different locations in the jet ( e.g. begelman , blandford & rees 1984 ) .",
    "the seds calculated here refer to the innermost emitting region .",
    "an interesting feature of the ec model is the presence of a spectral break in the soft x - ray continuum , which reflects very sensitively the minimum energy of the scattering electrons : @xmath61 ( e.g. sikora et al . 1993 ) .",
    "for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 hz . for frequencies below @xmath65 only seed photons with @xmath66 are available so that the compton spectrum will be depleted ( flatter ) with respect to the spectrum above @xmath65 , where the bulk of the seed photons is scattered ( sikora et al .",
    "1997 , ghisellini 1996 ) .",
    "the lack of soft x - ray photons observed in 0836 + 710 , previously interpreted as due to the presence of intrinsic absorption ( e.g. cappi et al . 1997 ) , could be due to a curved spectrum produced by this effect ( see fig .",
    "[ [ 0836_sed ] ] ) .",
    "note that the position of this spectral break strongly constrains @xmath67 to be @xmath68 a few .",
    "this is relevant for the study of the global energy and matter content in jets ( e.g. celotti & fabian 1993 , celotti et al .",
    "1997 , sikora & madejski 2000 ) .",
    "in general the ic spectrum will be the sum of the ssc and ec emission . for 1510 - 089",
    "the ssc peak lies at energies between the uv and the soft x - ray band and its presence could account for the observed soft x - ray excess in the soft x - ray band in this source .",
    "alternatively this excess could be the hard tail of the observed strong uv bump as proposed for 3c273 . while both the above explanations appear plausible , it is also possible that the excess could be produced by ic scattering of external photons by a population of cold electrons as discussed by begelman et al .",
    "( 1987 ) ( se also sikora et al . [ 1997 ] ) . for the other two sources",
    "the ssc contribution lies well below the ec spectrum .",
    "the adopted model predicts a slope close to 0.5 on the low energy portion of the ic bump , due to radiatively cooled electrons below the minimum injection energy . in particular for 0836 + 710 the data require a flatter power law .",
    "this might be attributed to the fact that electrons escape before cooling and/or that a reacceleration process energises the cooled particles .",
    "the estimate of the physical parameters in the emitting region of @xmath0-loud quasars allows us to calculate the relevant energy densities and corresponding flux along the jet .",
    "this was done initially by celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) and for a larger sample by celotti et al .",
    "the total transported energy flux can be expressed as :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the rest frame energy densities of relativistic electrons , protons and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "@xmath70 can be expressed as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the numerical electron density and @xmath75 is the average lorentz factor .",
    "radiation is excluded from @xmath76 since the jet is optically thin .    in a jet composed by an electron / positron plasma @xmath77 , while for a proton / electron plasma with no cold electrons @xmath78 and if protons are assumed to be cold , @xmath79 . in tab .",
    "5 we report the energy densities and the energy fluxes estimated from the spectral model .",
    "we report in line 3 of tab .",
    "5 the total emitted power , i.e. the observed power integrated over the whole solid angle ( e.g. sikora et al . 1997 ) .",
    "it appears from table 5 that the magnetic energy density dominates over the energy density of relativistic electrons but not by a large factor , i.e. it is reasonably close to equipartition .",
    "the radiated power is much larger than that carried by relativistic electrons and by the poynting flux associated with the field in the emission region .",
    "it seems then necessary to postulate that the proton component dominates the energy transport or that the jet is structured so that a large poynting flux is carried outside the emitting region .",
    "if the number density of protons was the same as that of electrons , the proton kinetic power would reach values of the order of @xmath80 erg / s .",
    "we recall that this estimate is based on the fact that from the observed x - ray emission we can actually constrain the number of low energy electrons .",
    "the proton contribution would however be overestimated if the jet was partly composed of _ relativistic _ pair plasma .",
    "a large component of _ cold _ pairs is excluded by our data ( except possibly for 1510 - 089 ) , since it would give rise to an excess around 1 kev which is not observed ( e.g. sikora & madejski 2000 ) .",
    "the powers transported by these jets are quite large even when the proton component is not included .",
    "it is interesting to compare them with those released by the accretion process which can be estimated directly from the strength of the blue bump which is measured in all three objects .",
    "the derived accretion disk luminosities are listed in the last column of table 5 . for 0836 + 710 we used the luminosity of the blackbody spectrum fit to the data by lawrence et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , while for 1510 - 089 and 2230 + 114 we estimated @xmath81 from the uv ( pian & treves 1993 ) and the optical spectrum ( falomo et al . 1994 ) , respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that in each case the disk luminosity is of the same order of that radiated by the associated jet .",
    "note that in the hypothesis @xmath78 the power transported in the jets would exceed the luminosity emitted by the accretion disks by a large factor .",
    "let us briefly discuss the above numbers in the context of the blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) scenario of powering the jet from the black hole spin . in this model",
    "the jet power depends on the black hole mass and angular momentum and on the intensity of the magnetic field threading the horizon .",
    "recently the relation between the magnetic field at the innermost stable orbit of the disk and that at the black hole horizon has been discussed in depth by ( ghosh & abramowitz ( 1997 ) ( ga ) livio , ogilvie & pringle ( 1999 ) ( lop ) . using the standard shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) model for the accretion disk ga arrived at the following expression for the extractable power valid for high accretion rates , when the disk is dominated by radiation pressure : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the black hole mass ( in units of @xmath84 @xmath85 ) and",
    "@xmath86 is the spin parameter ( @xmath87 for a maximally rotating black hole ) .    comparing this expression with the values found above ,",
    "we conclude that even for maximal values of the accretion rate , spin parameter and mass ( @xmath88 ) , the estimated powers are insufficient for at least two objects .",
    "if protons are included the discrepancy becomes extremely large .",
    "we are therefore led to suggest that the analysis of ga and lop probably represents a lower limit to the jet powers produced .",
    "in fact krolik ( 1999 ) points out the difficulties of a realistic approach to the determination of the magnetic field near the black hole horizon , while meyer ( 1999 ) considers the possibility of a magnetic field amplification due to the frame dragging in the ergosphere of a kerr hole , leading to jet power estimates larger by a factor 100 than those given by ga . allowing for this uncertainty",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath89 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "2 .    using now the observed disk luminosity we can write :    @xmath90    ( where @xmath91 is the accretion rate in eddington units , @xmath92 ) which , combined with eq.([garad ] ) yields @xmath93 2400 , 180 , 15 and @xmath94 @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the three objects respectively .",
    "thus for @xmath89 = 100 we get masses in the range @xmath98 @xmath85 and critical accretion rates while for @xmath89=10 the masses are higher and the accretion rates lower by a factor 10 .",
    "we conclude that a value of @xmath89 between 10 and 100 is needed .",
    "we have analized the x - ray spectra of three @xmath0-ray loud quasars .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that for all sources the x - ray continuum in the 2 - 100 kev energy band is well represented by a very flat ( @xmath99 ) power - law , without evidence for spectral steepening at high energies .",
    "moreover at soft energies 0836 + 710 shows evidence for either intrinsic absorption , or an extremely hard low energy continuum . in 1510 - 089",
    "a soft excess is present at @xmath100 1 kev ; the presence of a fe line in this object is not confirmed .    by modelling the seds of these three sources as synchrotron and",
    "inverse compton emission from a single population of electrons with a broken power law energy distribution and including external seed photons for the ic process we estimated the physical parameters in the emission region and the corresponding energy transport along the jets . while the energy density of relativistic electrons and of the magnetic field are near equipartition , their energy is insufficient to power the observed radiation , implying that either a significant proton component or poynting flux outside the emission region are the carriers of power .",
    "even the minimal jet power required by the observed radiation is very high ( @xmath101 erg s@xmath12 ) and is of the same order of that thermally emitted in the optical - uv bands by the accretion disk .",
    "if the blandford & znajek model for extraction of rotational energy from the black hole is responsible for powering the jets the magnetic field at the black hole horizon must be larger than estimated in recent works on this highly complex and controversial issue .",
