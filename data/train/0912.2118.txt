    "x - ray absorption variability is a common feature in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "an analysis of a sample of nearby x - ray obscured agn with multiple x - ray observations , performed a few years ago ( risaliti et al .",
    "2002 ) revealed that column density ( n@xmath0 ) variations are almost ubiquitous in local seyfert galaxies .",
    "more recent observations performed with _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ and _ suzaku _ further confirmed this finding .",
    "the physical implications of these measurements are that the circumnuclear x - ray absorber ( or , at least , one component of it ) must be clumpy , and located at sub - parsec distances from the central source .",
    "the comparison between different observations , typically performed at time distances of months - years , only provides upper limits to the intrinsic time scales of @xmath3 variations .",
    "an improvement of these estimates can only be obtained through observational campaigns within a few weeks / days , and/or through the search for n@xmath0 variations within single long observations .",
    "such short time - scale studies have been already performed for a handful sources : ngc  1365 ( risaliti et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 , 2009 ) , ngc  4388 ( elvis et al .",
    "2004 ) , ngc  4151 ( puccetti et al .",
    "in particular , in the case of the agn in ngc  1365 we revealed extreme spectral changes , from compton - thin ( n@xmath0 in the range 10@xmath4  @xmath5 ) to reflection - dominated ( n@xmath0@xmath610@xmath7  @xmath5 ) in time scales from a couple of days to @xmath810  hours .",
    "such rapid events imply that the absorption is due to clouds with velocity v@xmath610@xmath1  km  s@xmath2 , at distances of the order of 10@xmath9 gravitational radii ( assuming that they are moving with keplerian velocity around the central black hole ) .",
    "the physical size and density of the clouds are of the order of 10@xmath10  cm and 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12  @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "all these physical parameters are typical for broad line region ( blr ) clouds , strongly suggesting that the x - ray absorber and the clouds responsible for broad emission lines in the optical / uv are one and the same .    here",
    "we present more evidence , based on time resolved x - ray spectroscopy , of variable x - ray absorption due to blr clouds , and we show how in the best cases we can use x - ray observations to directly probe the nature and physical state of blr clouds .",
    "variations on time scales of a few days discovered with campaigns of snapshot observations.,width=510 ]    x - ray absorption due to blr clouds crossing the line of sight to the observer implies variability time scales from hours to weeks , depending of the physical size of the x - ray source . we can obtain a rough estimate of the occultation times assuming a cloud moving with keplerian velocity around the central black hole , and a size of the x - ray source of 10  r@xmath14 : t@xmath83@xmath1510@xmath16  m@xmath17  v@xmath18 , where m@xmath17=m/(10@xmath19  m@xmath20 ) and v@xmath21=v/(10@xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "two observational methods have been used to investigate @xmath3 variations at these time scales : + 1 ) snapshot observations of the same source , repeated every few days .",
    "after the first successful campaign of six short ( 10  ks ) _ chandra _ observations of ngc  1365 , we repeated this approach for other bright compton - thin sources with column densities between 10@xmath4 and 10@xmath7  @xmath5 , using both archival data and dedicated observations . in this way we discovered clear cases of @xmath3 variations in ngc  4151 and ugc",
    "4203 ( one of the few `` changing look '' sources , known for having been observed in the past in both compton - thin and reflection - dominated states ) .",
    "a further case of such variations has been discovered by bianchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in ngc  7582 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "+ 2 ) study of the spectral variations of bright sources during long observations .",
    "this method consists of a two - phase analysis : we first use the hardness - ratio light curve to select the time intervals where strong spectral variations occurred ; we then perform a complete analysis of the spectra obtained from these intervals , in order to measure possible n@xmath0 varations ( and to check if the spectral changes are due to other effects , such as variations of the slope of the continuum emission ) .        this approach is illustrated in fig .  2 for the long _ xmm - newton _ observation of mrk  766 .",
    "a complete analysis of these data is presented in turner et al .",
    "2007 and miller et al .  2007 .",
    "with respect to these works , our analysis is in many aspects less detailed ( though the results are in full agreement ) , but is more effective in isolating the effects of possible n@xmath0 variations .",
    "we note that mrk  766 is a narrow line seyfert  1 , so on average we do not expect to observe complete x - ray absorption of the x - ray source .",
    "however , as we show below , isolated clouds occasionally cross the line of sight , producing measurable absorption in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the upper panel of fig .  2 shows the standard 2 - 10  kev flux light curve for this observation , with the well known strong variability on time scales of thousands of seconds , or even shorter .",
    "the lower panel shows the light curve of the ( 6 - 10  kev)/(2 - 5  kev ) flux ratio .",
    "in general , this light curve shows much smaller variations , indicating that the continuum shape remains the same during most of the luminosity variations .",
    "however , clear exceptions are observed in at least three intervals , highlighted in fig .  2 .",
    "during these intervals it is possible that a cloud with n@xmath0 of the order of 10@xmath4  @xmath5 has covered the central source , strongly decreasing the observed flux in the soft band , without affecting the hard band , and therefore increasing the observed hardness ratio .        following this interpretation , in the first interval we should be observing a cloud uncovering the x - ray source ( with the covering phase occurred before the beginning of the observation ) ; in the second interval another cloud shoud be covering the x - ray source , with",
    "the uncovering phase not observed due to the `` dead time '' between two consecutive _ xmm - newton _ orbits .",
    "finally , in the third interval we should be observing the whole eclipse .    , and covering factor . , width=510 ]    in order to check this scenario , we performed a complete analysis of the spectra obtained from the three highlighted intervals , and of those obtained from the third and fourth orbit , representing the standard spectral state of the source . in this analysis",
    "we allowed all the main spectral parameters of the model to vary among the different intervals .",
    "the results of the this study , illustrated in fig .  3 are the following : 1 ) the 2 - 10  kev spectrum obtained from the third and fourth orbit ( the `` standard '' state ) is well reproduced by a typical model for type  1 agns , consisting of a power law , a reflection component and an iron emission line ; 2 ) the spectral variations observed in the three intervals discussed above are completely reproduced by three absorption components with column densities in the range 1 - 3  10@xmath4  @xmath5 .        the analysis briefly summarized here has been applied to several sources with long archival observations by _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku_. up to now , we obtained unambiguous evidence for @xmath3 variations in ngc  4388 , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , mrk  766 , ngc  1365 .",
    "a further case of similar variations has been found in a _",
    "observation of ngc  3227 ( liu et al .",
    "2010 , subm . ) .",
    "a summary of all the positive detections obtained so far is shown in table  1 . in all cases",
    "the inferred physical parameters for the obscuring clouds clearly indicate that the x - ray absorption is due to blr clouds .",
    "the analysis presented above can be further refined in the few cases where the statistics is high enough to perform a more detailed study , or where multiple occultation event occur .",
    "in particular , we briefly summarize two results from the analysis of the two so - far best studied sources , mrk  766 and ngc  1365 .",
    "+ * 1 ) velocity distribution of blr clouds . *",
    "the analysis of the spectral variations in mrk  766 ( fig .  2 - 4 ) directly provides contraints on the distribution of blr cloud velocities , from the comparison of the durations of the observed occultations .",
    "the actual values of the cloud velocity in each case can not be precisely determined , being dependent on the exact size of the x - ray source .",
    "however , the ratio between the durations of the different eclipses is an estimate of the velocity ratios . in particular , the duration of the two first occultation events ( fig .",
    "2 ) , is about 4 - 5 times longer than that of the third eclipse .",
    "this suggests a similar spread in the velocity of blr clouds .",
    "+ * 2 ) structure of blr clouds .",
    "* the model adopted to reproduce the observed occultation events consists of an absorption component with a constant ( during the eclipse ) n@xmath0 , and a variable covering fraction , @xmath22 .",
    "this is an extreme simplification of the cloud structure , which is assumed to have constant column density , and very sharp edges .",
    "the model can be improved by releasing the assumption of constant n@xmath0 .",
    "doing so , in most of the cases analyzed so far we found that it is impossible to significantly constrain the values of n@xmath0 and @xmath22 during the different phases of an eclipse , due to their strong degeneracy .",
    "in other words , it is only possible to study the evolution of one parameter , freezing the other one .",
    "the only exceptions found so far , i.e. spectra with enough signal - to - noise to analyze the evolution of the two parameters at the same time , are mrk  766 and ngc  1365 .    in fig .",
    "4a we show the results of a recent analysis of a _ suzaku _ observation of ngc  1365 ( maiolino et al .",
    "2010 , subm ) , where the hardness ratio light curve clearly shows at least two possible occultation events .",
    "we performed a complete spectral analysis of several short intervals before , during and after the eclipses , and we obtained the results shown in the two lower panels of fig .  4 , showing the light curves of the covering factor and the column density .",
    "the most interesting results come from the second eclipse : the covering factor @xmath22 increases during the occultation phase , with a constant n@xmath0@xmath83@xmath1510@xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "then , in the subsequent phase , @xmath22 remains compatible with 1 ( i.e. complete covering ) while the column density decreases .",
    "this behaviour can only be explained with a `` cometary shape '' of the obscuring cloud , with a high column density head , and a tail with decreasing n@xmath0 .",
    "an analogous result has been obtained ( though with smaller statistical significance ) for the first two eclipses in mrk  766 ( fig .",
    "the third eclipse of mrk  766 is instead too fast to allow a detailed spectral analysis ( the spectral counts in such short time intervals are not enough to break the degeneracy between @xmath22 and @xmath3 , as shown in fig .  5 ) .",
    "however , a strong indication of a cometary tail comes from the residuals with respect to the best fit model during and after the eclipse , showing strong absorption lines due to fe  xxv in outflow with a velocity of 10 - 15000 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these features completely disappear after @xmath840  ks .",
    "a complete analysis of these spectra , where we demonstrate the high statistical significance of the lines detections , is presented in a dedicated paper ( risaliti et al .",
    "2010 , subm . )",
    "the highly ionized component revealed by the absorption lines strongly suggest the presence of a ionized outflowing tail associated to the obscuring cloud .",
    "we note that this highly ionized component is not present in the first two occultation events in mrk  766 , but only in the third , much faster event .",
    "even if one case is clearly not enough to build a complete model , the data suggest a scenario where the obscuring clouds are distributed in a large range of distances from the center ( if we assume keplerian velocity , the factor @xmath84 - 5 of spread in velocities corresponds to a factor of @xmath820 of spread in distances ) , and where the clouds closer to the center are also the more ionized ones .",

    "the main results of our analysis are : + 1 ) fast ( hours - days ) column density variability is common among agns .",
