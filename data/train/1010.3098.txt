    "even two decades after first analysis of this @xcite , no consensus has been reached on the nature of the qp phase and the type of transition into it , see e.g. ref .   and references therein .",
    "possible qp phases in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model include a columnar dimer vbc @xcite , a plaquette vbc @xcite , but also a sl @xcite .",
    "for the nel to vbc transition deconfined quantum criticality has been proposed as a novel scenario @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model may be realized in several layered materials such as li@xmath6vo(si , ge)o@xmath7 @xcite , vomoo@xmath7 @xcite , and bacdvo(po@xmath7)@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one approach to shed additional light on the qp region of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is to embed its analysis into a larger parameter space . in this context",

    "first indications of non - classical behavior for finite @xmath21 where obtained at @xmath22 .",
    "a spin - peierls state was found in exact diagonalization ( ed ) studies in the vicinity of @xmath23 , between the nel phase and the diagonal spiral @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo and @xmath24 expansion resulted in a succession of a vbc and a @xmath25 spin - liquid in this region @xcite .",

    "this implies broken translation and rotation symmetry .",
    "for @xmath32 , ed shows strong columnar dimer correlations @xcite .",
    "finally , the order of the transitions from the qp into the semiclassical phases , and in particular to the diagonal spiral , remain an open issue .    in this work",
    "we intend to further clarify the _ extent _ of the qp regime , using three complementary techniques , namely , functional renormalization group ( frg ) , coupled cluster methods ( ccm ) , and series expansion ( se ) .",
    "these methods display rather distinct strengths and limitations which we will combine .",
    "ccm and se are methods which operate inherently in the thermodynamic limit , however require extrapolation with respect to cluster size or expansion order .",
    "the frg method is in principle also formulated in the thermodynamic limit , but its numerical implementation requires one to restrict the spin correlation length to a maximal value , which is much larger than system sizes in ed studies . at present neither of these methods alone allows to investigate the full range of semiclassically ordered and qp states , however their combinations provides completive information on the quantum critical lines bounding qp regions : frg can signal magnetic instabilities of a paramagnetic state , the se limits the qp region , and ccm clarifies the stability of part of the ordered states . as a main result of this paper",
    "we will show that the quantum critical lines agree remarkably well between all three methods , establishing part of the quantum paramagnetic region rather firmly .",
    "unfortunately none of our approaches allow to determine the symmetry of the qp state unbiased , which leaves this an open issue .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide for a brief technical account of all three approaches .",
    "section iii is devoted to a discussion of the results .",
    "we conclude in section iv .",
    "in this work we mainly employ three methods to deal with quantum spin systems , namely frg , see section  [ frg ] , which uses a diagrammatic , dynamical renormalization group approach , ccm , see section  [ ccm ] , which is a cluster expansion method employing an exponential ansatz for the correlated ground state , and finally se in the exchange coupling constants , see section  [ se ] , based on continuous unitary transformations . in the following we briefly explain each of these methods .      the first approach to tackle the system",
    "is based on the functional renormalization group ( frg ) in conjunction with a pseudo - fermion representation of the @xmath33 spin operators .",
    "a detailed description of the frg in general is given e.g. in ref .  .",
    "for an implementation of frg with pseudo fermions and an application to the @xmath34-@xmath35-heisenberg - model , we refer the reader to ref .  .",
    "this approach is guided by the idea to treat spin models in the framewok of standard feynman many body techniques . in order to be able to apply the methods of quantum field theory ( wick s theorem )",
    ", we use the pseudo - fermion representation of spin operators , @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the annihilation operators of the pseudo fermions and @xmath39 are the pauli - matrices .",
    "this representation requires a projection of the larger pseudo - fermion hilbert space ( 4 states per lattice site ) onto the physical subspace of singly occupied states ( 2 states ) . at zero temperature",
    "we may perform this projection by putting the chemical potential of the pseudo fermions to zero .",
    "empty or doubly occupied states are acting like a vacancy in the spin lattice and are therefore associated with an excitation energy of order @xmath40 .",
    "quantum spin models are inherently strong coupling models , requiring infinite resummations of perturbation theory .",
    "the simplest such approach is mean - field theory of the spin susceptibility , which is known to provide qualitatively correct results in the case that a single type of order is present . on the other hand ,",
    "frustrated systems are characterized by competing types of order .",
    "this is a situation when frg is a powerful tool , as it allows to resum the contributions in all the different ( mixed ) channels in a controlled and unbiased way .",
    "the first step is the introduction of a sharp infrared frequency cutoff for the matsubara green s functions .",
    "frg then generates a formally exact hierarchy of coupled differential equations for the one - particle - irreducible vertex functions where the frequency cutoff @xmath41 is the flow parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the two first equations of the hierarchy , the first one , fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( a ) for the pseudo - fermion selfenergy , which has a crucial role in particular for highly frustrated interactions ( see ref .  ) , the second one , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) , for the two - particle vertex function . the @xmath42-function of the latter has a contribution given by the three - particle vertex function .",
    "following katanin ( ref .  )",
    "we approximate the three - particle vertex by the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( c ) . in this way",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) is recovered as a diagram subset , ensuring the qualitatively correct behavior on the approach to an ordered phase .",
    "another way of saying this is that the conserving properties of the approximation ( the ward identities ) are satisfied in a better way .",
    "it is worth noting that without the three - particle vertex contribution , rpa can not be recovered . keeping the contribution fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( c ) is formally equivalent to the replacement of the single scale propagator @xmath43 by @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the scale - dependent green s functions ) .",
    "the approximation may be regarded as a natural extension of the usual one - loop truncation , in which all three - particle vertex contributions are discarded . on the other hand",
    "it is also important to keep all the terms consisting of two two - particle vertices on the r.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]  ( b ) , as they control disorder tendencies and therefore the size of the paramagnetic region .     and the two - particle vertex is displayed . ]",
    "the frg equations depicted in fig .  [ fig2 ] ( a)-(c ) are solved on the imaginary frequency axis and in real space , rather than in momentum space .",
    "the numerical solution requires a discretization on the frequency axis by a logarithmic mesh .",
    "we found that it is essential to keep the full frequency dependence of the vertex function ( 3 frequency variables ) .",
    "the spatial dependence is approximated by keeping correlation functions up to a maximal length . as a result , for each set of discrete frequencies and site indices on external legs of a vertex function , one rg equation is obtained . for well converged results",
    "we typically need to keep sets of about @xmath46 coupled ordinary differential equations . in the present formulation long - range order ( lro )",
    "is not taken into account .",
    "therefore we should not find a stable solution of the equations down to @xmath47 in the parameter regimes where lro is present .",
    "the existence of a stable solution therefore indicates the absence of lro .",
    "it is worth to emphasize again that our frg approach has no bias concerning magnetic lro or a paramagnetic state .",
    "our starting point of free , dispersionless auxiliary fermions does not imply any tendency towards a certain state .",
    "the physical quantities of interest here , the spin susceptibility and spin correlation function may be obtained from the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( d ) .",
    "below we discuss results for the static susceptibilities as a function of the wave vector . in the ordered phases the susceptibility at the @xmath48-vector corresponding to the magnetic lro is found to increase as the running cutoff @xmath41 is decreased , until the solution becomes unstable below a certain value of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the @xmath48-vector characterizing the magnetic order at hand may be determined as that corresponding to maximal growth of the susceptibility . if the susceptibilities flow smoothly towards @xmath47 for any @xmath48-vector , we are in a disordered phase .",
    "next we analyze the system from a complementary viewpoint using the ccm , the main features of which we briefly illustrate now . for more details the reader",
    "is referred to refs .   and references therein .",
    "we mention , that the ccm has been applied successfully to determine the stability range of magnetically ordered ground state phases in frustrated quantum magnets @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the ccm is appropriate to investigate frustrated quantum spin systems with incommensurate magnetic structures @xcite .",
    "the starting point for a ccm calculation is the choice of a normalized reference state @xmath49 , together with a set of mutually commuting multispin creation and destruction operators @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are defined over a complete set of many - body configurations @xmath52 .",
    "we choose @xmath53 in such a way that we have @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "note that the ccm formalism corresponds to the thermodynamic limit @xmath56 .",
    "depending on the model parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 we have considered the nel , the collinear , and the diagonal spiral state .",
    "results on the @xmath17-state could not be obtained at sufficient precision .",
    "we work in a locally rotated frame of reference such that all spins of the reference state align along the negative @xmath57 axis . obviously , the choice of the rotated coordinate frame depends on the choice of the reference state @xmath49 . for a spiral reference state the local rotation angle",
    "is related to the pitch @xmath58 . in the rotated coordinate frame",
    "the reference state reads @xmath59 , where the indices @xmath60 denote arbitrary lattice sites .",
    "the ccm is based on ket and a bra ground states , @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , which are parameterized as @xmath63 where the so - called correlation coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 are determined from the ccm equations @xmath66e^s|\\phi\\rangle = 0 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for each @xmath52 . using the schrdinger equation , @xmath67 , whereas the magnetic order parameter is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is expressed in the rotated coordinate frame and @xmath70 is the spin quantum number .",
    "we note , that for the spiral state the pitch vector @xmath58 is used as a free parameter in the ccm calculation , which has to be determined by minimization of the ccm ground state energy with respect to @xmath58 .    in order to proceed",

    "here we use the well elaborated lsub@xmath73 scheme , where only @xmath73 or fewer correlated spins in all configurations , which span a range of no more than @xmath73 adjacent ( contiguous ) lattice sites , are included . the number of fundamental configurations can be reduced exploiting lattice symmetry and conservation laws . in the ccm - lsub10 approximation",
    "we have finally @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) fundamental configurations for the nel ( collinear ) reference state and for the ccm - lsub8 approximation we have finally @xmath76 fundamental configurations for the spiral reference state .    to obtain results at @xmath77 ,",

    "therefore the se can be carried out in spaces of fixed @xmath82 , which greatly reduces the computational complexity as compared to other se methods .",
    "for the latter notions to be of reason , the unperturbed energy spectrum has to be equidistant , which limits the particular types of unperturbed hamiltonians and phases which can be analyzed . here",

    "cut se using plaquette vbcs has been carried out for various systems recently @xcite and we refer the reader to there , for more details .",

    "( [ heff ] ) is _",
    "zero_. in turn , the eigenstates are classified by @xmath82 and their energy is obtained by diagonalizing @xmath95 within an @xmath96 dimensional space only , where @xmath97 is the system size . for the ground state energy @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which implies that it is given by a single matrix element of @xmath95 , namely @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the _ unperturbed _ bare plaquette state . for one - particle excitations @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which however , due to translational invariance also reduces to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 refers to momentum .",

    "first we note that the classical energy , which is not contained in this figure , varies similar with @xmath2 as compared to the other graphs plotted , however it is larger by @xmath110 on the average . secondly , it is obvious that peps is significantly higher than the other results @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is most pronounced in the ordered regimes , where @xmath111 is a best currently available value from quantum monte - carlo @xcite for the nearest neighbor heisenberg model . on the other hand , both , ccm and se are rather close to the ed . each of them has been plotted up to the critical values @xmath112 which define the extend of the ordered and qp phases as determined in the following section . at the endpoints ccm and",
    "se match up acceptably , where the agreement at @xmath113 is best and the convergence of the se may be less reliable for @xmath114 which is the larger .",
    "thirdly , having in mind that the finite - size shift of the ed data for @xmath115 is about @xmath116 , see refs .",
    ", it is remarkable that the ccm , ed and se data almost coincide if @xmath2 is not too large .",
    "the increase of the difference between the ed and ccm data at larger @xmath2 can be attributed to the crossover ( i ) of the characteristic length scale from nearest - neighbor ( @xmath0-bonds ) to 3rd - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath2-bonds ) separation and ( ii ) of the characteristic energy scale from @xmath0 to @xmath2 .",
    "while the first crossover effect leads to an enhanced finite - size effect in the ed energy and to a larger impact of lsub@xmath73 clusters with @xmath73 beyond those considered here , the second crossover effect automatically enhances any discrepancy of energies roughly proportional to @xmath2 .",

    "since frg evaluates the static susceptibility over the complete brillouin zone , it allows to determine the wave vector @xmath137 of the dominant short - range magnetic correlations or the pitch vector of the magnetic order parameter .",
    "these wave vectors are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] together with the quantum phases discussed already in fig .",
    "both , in the ordered as well as in the qp phase we find the wave vectors at maximum of the susceptibility to agree approximately with those obtained for the purely classical model in fig .",

    "this is particularly interesting with respect to the @xmath17-spiral state , which seems to exist only in the form of short range correlations in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .    in order to illustrate how the dominant fluctuations in the disordered phase change with varying couplings , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] results for the static susceptibility as a function of the @xmath48-vector in the brillouin zone with @xmath138 $ ] at fixed @xmath139 for various values of @xmath1 . for @xmath20 we see a broadened peak at a @xmath16-position which has already moved away from the nel - point @xmath140 .",
    "this peak further moves along the brillouin - zone diagonal for increasing @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath141 it is seen that the peak smoothly deforms into an arc and that the weight at the brillouin - zone boundary increases . between @xmath142 and @xmath143 , close to the classical first order transition , the ridge has constant weight and the maximum jumps to a @xmath17-direction to then further evolve towards the collinear points @xmath144 , @xmath145 and to acquire more prominence .",
    "therefore , remnants of the classical correlations survive into the qp regime . very similar behavior is evidenced by ed @xcite .",

    "the black dots mark the positions of the maxima . ]",
    "to summarize , we have studied the quantum phases of the frustrated planar @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath2 spin-1/2 quantum - antiferromagnet , using frg , ccm , and cut se .",
    "this includes evaluations of momentum resolved susceptibilities , the ground state energy , magnetic order parameters , and the elementary excitation gaps .",
    "our results provide clear evidence for a sizeable quantum paramagnetic region which opens up between the nel , collinear , and spiral state of the purely classical model .",
    "a long - range ordered collinear spiral phase , which is also present classically has not been observed in the quantum model in the parameter range we have investigated .",
    "where applicable , the agreement between the critical lines determined from all three methods is remarkably good .",
    "while our computational approaches can not determine potentially broken symmetries in the quantum paramagnetic state , the fact that the critical lines which we have obtained from frg and ccm agree well with those from the cut se which is based on a plaquette vbc , is indicative of vbc ordering with substantial plaquette correlations in the quantum paramagnetic region - in those parameter ranges where cut se applies .",
    "our results are consistent with second order transitions from the nel and the collinear state into the quantum paramagnet .",
    "unexpectedly , our ccm results do not provide a definite signal of a transition from the spiral state into the quantum paramagnet .",
    "this may simply be related to an insufficient order of the lsubn approximation , but could also hint at a first order transition and an intermediate phase between the vbc and the spiral state . finally ,",
    "while our findings do not show a collinear spiral state as in the classical model , frg convincingly demonstrates that the latter is replaced by corresponding short range correlations in the quantum paramagnetic region .",
