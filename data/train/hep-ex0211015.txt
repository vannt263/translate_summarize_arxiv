    "single beta decay or electron capture is expected to occur in nine isobaric doublets or triplets existing in nature @xcite .",
    "it has been actually detected in seven of them @xcite , while no evidence has been found for beta decay of the 9@xmath5 excited state of @xmath6ta @xcite .",
    "more complex is the situation @xcite for the second forbidden unique electron capture ( ec ) of @xmath0te to the ground state of @xmath0sb , with a transition energy of 53.3 @xmath7 0.2 kev ( q@xmath8 ) .",
    "contradictory experimental results have been in fact presented  @xcite .",
    "very low rates have been , on the other hand , predicted theoretically on the basis of a strong suppression of the nuclear matrix elements due to a cancellation between particle - particle and particle - hole correlations .",
    "as suggested by m.  bianchetti et .",
    "@xcite it is expected that these cancellations can lead to a suppression of the rate by up to six orders of magnitude . in a more recent and detailed paper , o.  civitarese and j.  suhonen  @xcite note that a suppression of the nuclear matrix element of the second - forbidden ec transition of this nucleus is a very severe test of the nuclear models used to calculate rare electroweak decays .",
    "one of the claimed experimental evidences of the decay  @xcite is in contradiction with this thoretical model .",
    "a precise measurement of the @xmath0te decay rate can therefore shed light both on the experimental situation and on the mechanisms which are at the basis of the above mentioned cancellation .",
    "ec processes , can be observed through the measurement of the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) photons accompanying a generally small fraction of decays , or through the atomic deexcitation cascade ( x - rays and/or auger electrons ) following the decay .",
    "individual atomic transitions ( single x - rays or auger electrons ) can be observed using a detector in direct contact , but external to the decay source .",
    "a single line corresponding to the binding energy of the captured electron ( sum of all atomic transition energies ) is on the contrary expected for a pure calorimetric approach , in which the source is also the detector ( as is the case for a low temperature thermal detector  @xcite ) .",
    "cryogenic setup used in the new measurement ( a ) .",
    "details of the inner roman lead shield are apparent .",
    "top ( b ) and side ( c ) view of the 20 teo@xmath1 crystal array are also shown . ]    unfortunately , atomic deexcitation cascades can be induced also by the interaction between the environmental radiation and the source ( e.g. photoelectric or compton effect ) . in this case , however , the involved atomic levels are those of the parent atom , while in a genuine ec decay they correspond to those of the daughter one ( table [ tab : dede ] ) .",
    "evidence for the k ec decay of @xmath0te was obtained by watt and glover  @xcite with a lifetime @xmath9 years , using a proportional counter . such a value",
    "is still reported in the nuclear tables  @xcite . only the x - rays escaping from the te source ( anode wires )",
    "could be recorded in such an experiment .",
    "furthermore , due to the insufficient energy resolution of the proportional counter , there was no possibility to discriminate between the sb x - ray line at 26.1 kev , distinctive of te ec decay , and the 27.3 te x - ray line due to the excitation of the tellurium source by cosmic rays and radioactivity .",
    "the inclusion of a non negligible background contribution ( the experiment was carried out at sea level ) could explain therefore why the authors obtained a so large rate for this process .",
    "this result was contradicted by a a previous cryogenic experiment ( run 0 ) carried out underground by our group using a low activity setup consisting of four thermal 340 g teo@xmath1 detectors .",
    "a description of this set - up and the operation of the anticoincidence is reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the almost complete elimination of the external background due to cosmic rays , special care was devoted to the reduction of background from environmenthal radioactivity . since the backround due to internal contamination of the crystals was negligible , the surface of the crystals and the wall of the copper frame facing them was treated to avoid contribution from surface contamination .",
    "external background was strongly reduced with layers of lead of minimum thickness of 20 cm .",
    "thanks to the adopted calorimetric approach and the good energy resolution of the detectors , we could clearly distinguish two peaks in the spectrum recorded at low energy : a peak at 27.3 kev corresponding to the energy of te k@xmath10 x - rays ( produced by the interaction of radiation with nearby te detectors ) , and a peak at 30.5 kev , corresponding to the total energy released by te k ec to sb .",
    "the different origin of the two peaks was moreover demonstrated by the comparison of the spectra collected requiring or not an anticoincidence between the four teo@xmath1 detectors  @xcite : the 27.3 kev line in fact disappeared in the anticoincidence spectra . by attributing the 30.5 kev peak to k ec of @xmath0te we obtained an evidence for this process and quoted a lifetime @xmath11 years , six orders of magnitude higher than in the experiment by watt and glover .",
    "the main drawback of our previous experiment result was the limited statistics .",
    "in addition we were worried that the 30.5 kev signal could be due to the activation of the @xmath12te isotope ( 0.908  % abundance ) by environmental neutrons .",
    "this isotope , despite its low abundance can in fact lead to a substantial production of @xmath2te and @xmath13te with cross sections of 0.3 and 2 b respectively .",
    "these isomers decay by ec with lifetimes of 16.8 and 154 days , respectively , yielding the same signal in the detector as the one expected for the ec decay of @xmath0te .",
    "the expected neutron activation in the underground laboratory is negligible , since thermal neutrons are suppressed by a factor of  10@xmath14 with respect to sea level  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath2te and @xmath13te nuclei could have been produced when the detectors were outside the laboratory .",
    "they could have persisted in the detectors during the measurement , since the run started underground immediately after the crystal installation .",
    "these considerations lead us to perform a new improved underground measurement . a larger cryogenic setup consisting of an array of twenty 340 g crystals of natural teo@xmath1  @xcite was operated ( fig.[fig : setup ] ) .",
    "low energy spectrum obtained in the run carried out two years after the crystals were stored underground where they were shielded against cosmic ray neutrons ( run 1 in the text).the peak in the spectrum , corresponding to the 46.6 line of @xmath15pb has a width of 1 kev fwhm . ]",
    "specifically relevant for the search reported here is the reduced background in the low energy region , mainly due to the addition of a low activity roman lead shield close to the detectors ( 10 cm above and below the detectors and of 1 cm around them ) . due to the absence of @xmath15pb@xcite ,",
    "this material is very effective in reducing the counting rate at low energy .",
    "this new experiment consists in two separate runs .",
    "the former ( run 1 ) started two years after the crystals were stored underground , in order to allow a substantial decay of the @xmath2te and @xmath13te nuclei produced during their preparation .",
    "the spectrum corresponding to 724.88 hours  @xmath16  kg of effective running time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:20old ] .",
    "the excellent resolution achieved ( 1 kev fwhm ) clearly indicates the stability of the experiment . with respect to our previous search",
    "the background is reduced by about an order of magnitude , due to better cleaning of the surfaces and introduction of the internal lead shields .",
    "this explains the disappearance of the 27 kev x - ray peak , due to background excitation of tellurium .",
    "moreover , the peak at 39.9 kev due to @xmath17bi observed in the spectrum of the previous experiment , is no more apparent due to the effective reduction of th contaminations in the new setup .",
    "the peak at 46.5 kev is due to surface activity of @xmath15pb , a common surface contaminant in all these experiments @xcite .",
    "the same contamination is also responsible of the bump at @xmath18  35 kev . as confirmed by monte carlo simulations",
    "this bump is the consequence of the ensemble of processes ( @xmath19 absorbtion and atomic rearrangement ) following the @xmath20 decay of @xmath15pb to the 46.5 kev excited state of @xmath15bi .",
    "unlike what had been indicated in the previous experiment , there is now no clear evidence of the peak at 30.5 kev , where the observed counts are 17 @xmath7 12 . in order to assess the origin of this disagreement we carried out a second run taking advantage of a long measurement stop during which the experimental setup was completely unmounted and rebuilt with the aim to further improve the background level . in particular",
    ", all crystals were brought outside the underground laboratory for a surface treatment aiming at a reduction of their surface radioactive contamination .",
    "they remained therefore exposed to environmental neutrons for a period of about two months .",
    "after this operation they were again installed underground and a second run ( run 2 ) totalling 259.59 hours  @xmath16  kg took place .",
    "the low energy spectrum reported in fig.[fig:20new ] clearly shows a peak at 30.5 kev which could now be attributed to the k ec of @xmath2te isomers produced by cosmic ray neutrons outside the tunnel and not to k ec of @xmath0te .      * the absence of a clear signal in our present data ( run 1 ) ; * the short period during which the teo@xmath1 crystals were stored underground before the start of our previous experiment ( run 0 ) ; * the evidence for a neutron activation contribution to ec signals ( 30.5 kev line ) in crystals exposed to sea level neutron flux and not stored underground for a long enough period ( run 2 ) ;    we conclude that _ there is so far no evidence for k electron capture of @xmath0te_. in particular , by applying a maximum likelihood analysis to the data collected during run 1 we can set a 90  % c.l .",
    "lower limit @xmath21 years on the half lifetime for k ec of @xmath0te .",
    "assuming a branching ratio for k capture @xmath22  @xcite , the inclusive limit for ec of @xmath0te is @xmath4 years ( 90  % c.l . ) .",
    "more theoretical efforts are needed to explain this strong suppression with respect to similar @xmath20 processes occurring in nature .        a continuous spectrum spanning the energy region up to q@xmath8 minus the binding energy of the captured electron ( b@xmath23 ) is expected for a conventional radiation detector .",
    "since however the atomic deexcitation energy is fully detected in the case of a calorimetric approach , the spanned energy region starts at b@xmath23 , up to q@xmath8 .",
    "the probability to observe bremsstrahlung photons of energy between 25 and 45 kev in our `` calorimeter '' is @xmath18 0.14  %  @xcite .",
    "this figure includes both the branching ratio and the detector efficiency .",
    "a total of ( 1067  @xmath7  33 ) counts was recorded in this energy region in our experiment , allowing us to set , conservatively , an inclusive lower limit of @xmath24 years ( 90  % c.l . ) for electron capture of @xmath0te in any decay channel .",
    "though statistically poorer such a result provides a complementary determination of the half lifetime for this process , independent of the decay channel , thus confirming the strong rate suppression observed for the k ec mode .",
    "thanks are due to the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso for generous hospitality .",
    "we gladly acknowledge the help of p.  gorla , s.  parmeggiano and l.  tatananni in various stages of this experiment .",
