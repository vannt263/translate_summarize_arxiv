    "sn 2002ap was a type ic sn discovered on jan 29.4 , 2002 in ngc 628 .",
    "the explosion energy of the sn was larger than usual type ic sne ( 4 - 10@xmath0 ergs ) .",
    "sn 2002ap was of great interest because it was one of the closest extragalactic sn ( d=7.3 mpc ) ; secondly it was a type ic sn and grb association of type ic is found in sn 1998bw ( with grb 980425 ) and sn 2003dh ( with grb 030329 ) .",
    "sn 2002ap has shown sn 1998bw like features like high velocity in early spectroscopy of optical data .",
    "study of type ic sne is interesting because they are devoid of h and he core and hence can probe closer to the central engine .",
    "xmm - newton observed sn 2002ap on feb 2 , 2002 for total 37.4 ksec with epic - pn and epic - mos .",
    "we found that chandra observatory has observed this field on jun 19 and on oct 19 , 2001 .",
    "inspection of pre - explosion chandra image reveals the presence of a source 14.9 `` away from the sn .",
    "( see figure [ fig : images ] ) .",
    "a spectrum of the sn was extracted using circle of radius 40 '' . while deriving the flux of the sn , we subtracted the contribution of nearby chandra source .",
    "table [ tab:5 ] @xcite gives results of different models fitted to the x - ray emission from the sn with a subtracted contribution due to chandra source . both power - law and thermal bremsstrahlung models",
    "however we can not say which one is better due to sparse data .",

    "we suggest that repeated scattering of optical photons can account for the prompt x - ray emission from sn 2002ap .",
    "x - ray sphere ( 7@xmath1 cm ) lies between optical ( 3.5@xmath1)and the radio photosphere ( 4@xmath2 cm ) . both wolf - rayet and interacting binary case",
    "bb are capable of providing the adequate  optical depth and are viable scenarios for the progenitor star .",
    "the properties of different kind of sne differ significantly from each other .",
    "in fact the same type of sne can show the significantly different properties .",
