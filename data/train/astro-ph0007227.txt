    "the dynamics of a collisionless stellar system is fully specified by its distribution function ( df )  the phase density of its constituent stars  and the form of the gravitational potential that binds it together .",
    "the most fundamental goal of galactic dynamics is the recovery of this information from the observable properties of a galaxy .",
    "there is some hope that this objective might soon be achieved : sophisticated data analysis techniques applied to the doppler broadening of galaxy spectra now routinely yield reasonable estimates for the full distribution of the stars line - of - sight velocities , generally referred to as their line - of - sight velocity distribution , or losvd ( see e.g. franx & illingworth 1988 , bender 1990 , rix & white 1992 , van der marel & franx 1993 , winsall & freeman 1993 , kuijken & merrifield 1993 ) . in principle , one can therefore measure a complete three - dimensional function , the density of stars as a function of both their line - of - sight velocities and the two spatial coordinates giving the position on the plane of the sky . since the df of a stellar system in equilibrium depends on at most three isolating integrals of motion ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , it is plausible that one might deproject the observed three - dimensional function into the galaxy s intrinsic df .",
    "although this dimensional argument suggests that the inversion might be carried out , we have no guarantee that the solution will be unique : it is possible that more than one df may produce identical losvds .",
    "further , the dynamics of a galaxy depends on the form of the gravitational potential that confines it .",
    "it is therefore also possible that a given set of kinematic observations will be consistent with different dynamical models depending on the form adopted for the gravitational potential .",
    "thus , we do not yet know whether the dynamics of a galaxy is uniquely specified by its observable properties .    in some special cases",
    ", we can make more definitive statements . for a spherical system with a known gravitational potential , for example",
    ", it has been proved that the dynamics is completely specified by the observable kinematics .",
    "dejonghe & merritt ( 1992 ) considered the moments of the velocity distribution  the velocity dispersion and its higher order analogues . for each order",
    ", they demonstrated that the intrinsic moments of a spherical galaxy s velocity distribution could be inferred from the observable line - of - sight component .",
    "they thus elegantly proved that all the intrinsic dynamical properties of the galaxy are specified by observable quantities .",
    "dejonghe & merritt also showed that the observable kinematics will limit the possible forms of the gravitational potentials that might be confining the system , although not necessarily to the point of specifying it uniquely .",
    "a further significant advance was made by merritt ( 1996 ) , who considered edge - on axisymmetric systems where the df respects two integrals of motion .",
    "he showed that for such systems one can use the information in the projected density of stars and the first two moments of their line - of - sight velocity distributions to estimate both the df and the gravitational potential .",
    "although not constituting a formal proof of uniqueness , the numerical solutions to merritt s equations do seem to indicate that accurate dynamical models can be inferred from the observable kinematic properties .    in theoretical studies of galaxy dynamics , manipulation of the moments of the velocity distribution",
    "is mathematically attractive because these quantities obey the jeans equations and their higher - order analogues ( merrifield & kent 1990 , dejonghe & merritt 1992 ) .",
    "however , the application of such analyses to observations is , in practice , fraught with difficulties .",
    "the higher - order moments on which dejonghe & merritt s ( 1992 ) proof depend are extremely sensitive to noise , so can not be calculated from real data .",
    "even the velocity dispersion , calculated from the second moment of the losvd , is difficult to estimate from noisy data , particularly if the velocity distribution has long tails out to high velocities . in poorer - quality data ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is often estimated by fitting a gaussian to the velocity distribution ; there is in reality little justification for such a procedure , and systematically - biassed estimates for the dispersion are almost certain to be the result .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore adopt a somewhat different approach .",
    "the prevalence of techniques for measuring full losvds suggests that it might be worth moving away from analysis of moments to using the complete shape of the velocity distribution directly in the analysis . to this end , we have been investigating the properties of a thin axisymmetric disk model . in section  2 ,",
    "we discuss how the dynamics of an inclined thin disk galaxy can be inferred directly from its observable kinematics .",
    "such a simplified model is clearly a rather special case , since each line of sight passes through the disk at only a single point .",
    "therefore , in section  3 we consider the extra complexity that is introduced when such a disk is viewed edge - on , so that each line of sight passes through many points in the galaxy .",
    "we have used the analysis of the inclined case to provide the basis for an iterative scheme for recovering the df of such an edge - on disk . in section  4",
    ", we test this algorithm on a realistic disk model , and show how the df can , indeed , be recovered from the observable kinematics .",
    "we further show that even small errors in the assumed gravitational potential lead to inconsistencies in the inferred kinematic properties , and hence that the potential is very tightly constrained by the observable properties of such a galaxy .",
    "section  5 discusses the possible practical application of this analysis to studies of disk galaxies .",
    "the simplest plausible model for a disk galaxy is one in which the system is axisymmetric , with all the motion confined to a single plane .",
    "for such a system , jeans theorem states that , in equilibrium , the df can depend only on two isolating integrals of motion , the energy of stars in the disk plane , and the angular momentum of stars about the centre of the galaxy ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "defining the usual polar coordinates about the centre of the system and writing the gravitational potential in the plane of the galaxy as @xmath0 , these integrals can be written as @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and the df can be expressed as a function @xmath3 .    at any radius in the galaxy",
    ", the tangential velocity distribution can be obtained by integrating the df over the whole range of radial velocity : f_(r , v _ ) = f(e , l ) dv_r = 2 _ w_^ , [ abeleq ] where w_= ( r ) + . if we transform variables and write f_(r , v _ )",
    "f_(w_,l ) , then equation  ( [ abeleq ] ) is an abel integral equation relating @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus , if @xmath5 is known , one can use a standard abel inversion to solve for the full df , f(e , l ) = - _ e^ .",
    "[ abelinv ]    for a thin disk at inclination @xmath6 to the line of sight , a quantity related to @xmath5 that one can observe is the line - of - sight velocity distribution as a function of projected radius along the galaxy s apparent major axis , @xmath7 . via some simple geometry",
    ", one can show that f_maj(r_p , v_los ) f_(r = r_p , v_= v_los / i)/i .",
    "[ fmaj ] thus , as first pointed out by merrifield & kuijken ( 1994 ) , if one observes the losvd along the major axis of such a disk , then one can readily derive @xmath5 and hence solve for the df by inverting equation  ( [ abeleq ] ) .",
    "more recently , a sophisticated investigation of this inversion has been made by pichon & thibaut ( 1998 ) , who showed that it is possible to regularize a non - parametric algorithm to carry out the requisite abel inversion without excessive noise amplification .",
    "there is a degree of redundancy in the inversion , which means that its implementation can be simplified somewhat further .",
    "every pair of @xmath8 values corresponds to two pairs of @xmath9 values , and hence two points in the observable @xmath10 parameter space .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is overspecified by the observed @xmath7 .",
    "if we define the galaxy s circular speed , @xmath12 , by the usual relation , v_c^2(r ) = r dd r , then it is straightforward to show that the df is completely specified by both the part of @xmath7 where @xmath13 and by the part where @xmath14 ( merrifield & kuijken 1994 ) .",
    "using just one part of the losvd allows us to simplify the quadrature in equation  ( [ abelinv ] ) . for the high - velocity side of the losvd in a realistic disk ,",
    "@xmath15 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath16 at a given value of the angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "one can show that any positive distribution function such that < 0 [ dfeneg ] yields a tangential velocity distribution @xmath15 with the above property . in stellar dynamics",
    "one usually considers systems with distribution functions that obey equation  ( [ dfeneg ] ) .",
    "definite criteria for the stability of spherical and axisymmetric stellar systems have been established for distribution functions which are decreasing functions of the energy ( antonov 1962 ) . moreover it is found that most distribution functions used to produce realistic models of galaxies do actually obey that condition . on the other hand ,",
    "very little work , either numerical or theoretical , has been done using distribution functions which do not satisfy such a condition and very little is known about the stability of these systems ( hnon 1973 , perez & aly 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , in our paper , we follow the generally accepted assumption given by equation  ( [ dfeneg ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath16 can be written as a monotonic function of @xmath15 at given @xmath17 .",
    "this property allows us to transform the above relation into f(e , l ) = _ 0^f_(w_= e , l ) .",
    "[ simpleabel ] provided that the function @xmath15 can be numerically inverted to give @xmath18 , this equation means that the df can be calculated with a simple one - dimensional integration , bypassing the computationally - unstable estimation of the derivative of @xmath15 in equation  ( [ abelinv ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , an inclined thin disk is rather simpler than most realistic galaxy models , since any line of sight will only intersect it at a single point .",
    "further , for an inclined system , one can not tell from the photometry whether the assumption that the disk is thin is a valid one  it is only when the system is viewed edge - on that its razor - thinness will be unambiguously apparent . we therefore now turn to consider the case of such a system viewed edge - on . in this case ,",
    "the losvd is not just a rescaled version of @xmath15 as in equation  ( [ fmaj ] ) , but instead is generated by an integration along the line of sight through the entire disk . by choosing the @xmath19-axis as the direction of the line of sight , one can write the losvd at some distance @xmath20 from the centre of the galaxy as f(r_p , v_los ) = dz d f(e , l ) [ projop ] where @xmath21 are the components of the velocity parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the line of sight respectively .",
    "the two components of the velocity @xmath22 can be written in terms of @xmath21 as : @xmath23 with = ; = ; r = . the integrals of motion are then @xmath24    the extra integration along the line of sight clearly complicates the relationship between the observed kinematics and the intrinsic dynamics of the galaxy .",
    "however , the properties that we have derived above for inclined disks suggest a way to proceed . in particular , the fact that the df is completely specified by the high - velocity tail of @xmath25 can be used to our advantage . in general",
    ", the mean - streaming circular motions of the stars in a realistic disk will be significantly greater than their random motions , so one can think of stars at each radius moving with a mean streaming velocity of close to the local circular speed , with a smaller amount of random motion superimposed .",
    "thus , the losvd at a projected radius @xmath20 in an edge - on disk will be peaked at a velocity close to @xmath26 . at lower line - of - sight velocities",
    ", there will be contributions both from stars that have intrinsically low velocities and from stars that lie at large radii in the galaxy , so that their large circular motions are oriented mostly transverse to the line of sight , resulting in a small line - of - sight component .",
    "however , at line - of - sight velocities greater than @xmath26 , the majority of the stars contributing to the losvd will be those where the circular motion is oriented along the line - of - sight , which occurs only for stars at radii @xmath27 .",
    "further , for the stars at radii close to @xmath20 , the line - of - sight component of their random motions measures their velocities in the @xmath28 direction .",
    "thus , to a simple approximation , for @xmath29 , f(r_p , v_los ) f_(r = r_p ,",
    "v_= v_los ) , [ lambdadef ] where @xmath30 is the length of path through the galaxy that lies sufficiently close to @xmath31 for there to be a significant contribution to @xmath32 . in terms used in the study of the milky way",
    ", this path - length covers the region of the tangent point , over which @xmath25 will not change rapidly ( since @xmath33 is not changing significantly ) , so the integral along the line of sight can be replaced by the simple product of equation  ( [ lambdadef ] ) .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ lambdadef ] ) implies that by observing the part of the losvd at high velocities , we obtain an estimate for the shape of the high - velocity part of the tangential velocity distribution , which we need to estimate the df .",
    "the close relation between @xmath32 and @xmath34 provides a good indication that the inversion of equation  ( [ projop ] ) may not be significantly more ill - conditioned than was the case for the simpler case of the inclined disk [ equation  ( [ abeleq ] ) ] .",
    "although equation  ( [ projop ] ) contains an extra integration , which often serves to smooth out some of the information in the integrand , in this case much the same information is contained in the double - integral [ @xmath32 ] as there was in the simpler single - integral [ @xmath36 . this discovery bodes well for the solution of equation  ( [ projop ] ) , since , as pichon & thibaut ( 1998 ) have ably demonstrated , it is quite possible to regularize the single - integral case to a point where it is realistically soluble .    if we are in practice to convert @xmath32 into @xmath37 , we need the value for the normalization factor , @xmath30 in equation  ( [ lambdadef ] ) . on the basis of simple geometric arguments",
    ", one might expect @xmath30 to be proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "however , the exact value @xmath30 can not be determined in any simple way .",
    "indeed , one would expect the value to depend on the df of the disk , the very thing that we are trying to derive .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the similarity between the shapes of @xmath38 and @xmath39 does form the basis for a useful iterative scheme for recovering the df , which is completely insensitive to the form adopted for @xmath30 .    in order to describe this scheme , we define some simplified notation .",
    "let @xmath40 be the abel inversion operator of equation  ( [ abeleq ] ) and @xmath41 the line - of - sight projection operator in equation  ( [ projop ] ) . in this notation , the line - of - sight velocity distribution , the df of the system and the tangential velocity distribution",
    "are related as follows : f(r_p , v_los ) = p f(e , l ) = p(a^-1 f _ ) .",
    "[ opdef ] we can now present an iterative algorithm which computes velocity distributions that converge towards the true tangential velocity distribution . as discussed above ,",
    "the part of the tangential velocity distribution above the rotation curve is sufficient to uniquely specify the df , and so for the remainder of this section we consider only this part of the distribution .",
    "let @xmath42 be the @xmath43 approximation to the tangential velocity distribution .",
    "as discussed in the previous paragraph , @xmath44 would be a good zeroth - order estimate if we knew the value for @xmath30 .",
    "however , even if @xmath30 is known , this estimate is only an approximation , so @xmath45 will differ somewhat from @xmath3 and hence @xmath46 will have systematic residuals from the observed form of @xmath47 that we started with . as a next iteration , we correct for these small residuals by subtracting them from our assumed form for the tangential velocity distribution , so that _",
    "^(n+1 ) = _ ^(n ) - ^-1 , [ iteration ] and iterate until convergence is achieved .",
    "if this scheme converges , we know that @xmath48 .",
    "it therefore follows from equation  ( [ iteration ] ) that ( a^-1 ( _ ^(n ) ) ) f. [ convergence ]    note that , with this formulation , if the iteration converges then the result will be totally independent of the adopted form for @xmath30 , so our ignorance as to the exact value for this parameter is not a problem  @xmath30 acts as a relaxation parameter in the iteration , which may affect the speed of convergence , but not the final answer .",
    "thus , as the iteration converges , from equation  ( [ opdef ] ) , we have @xmath49 .",
    "one can then obtain the distribution function by a simple abel inversion , @xmath50 .    to implement the abel inversion operation , @xmath40",
    ", one can draw on the sophisticated techniques developed by pichon & thibaut ( 1998 ) in their analysis of non - edge - on disks .",
    "however , this paper is primarily concerned with establishing whether the iterative scheme described above converges . for this purpose",
    ", we can consider model data in which the noise level is low , and apply the computationally - simpler approach given by equation  ( [ simpleabel ] ) .",
    "numerically , at each step , interpolations of the estimate of the df , its projected velocity distribution and the approximation of the tangential velocity distribution @xmath42 are computed .",
    "we constrain the tangential velocity distribution and distribution function estimates to be positive .",
    "a satisfactory approximation of the df is found when the difference between the losvd @xmath47 and the projection of the approximate df is small everywhere in a large region of the @xmath51 plane .",
    "the resolution of the interpolation grid ultimately limits the accuracy with which the df can be recovered with this iterative scheme , eventually resulting in noise amplification .",
    "to test the above proposed algorithm , we have constructed the line - of - sight velocity distribution as a function of projected radius for a moderately - realistic edge - on disk model .",
    "the df was taken to be of the form f = g(l ) , [ dfdef ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are two arbitrary functions of the angular momentum and @xmath54 is the energy of the circular orbit of angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "similar forms of dfs were described in previous work by binney ( 1987 ) and kuijken & tremaine ( 1991 ) . for these tests ,",
    "we adopt functional forms of ( l ) = ( ) [ betadef ] and g(l ) = \\ {    ll ( - ) & if   l 0 + 0 & otherwise .    .",
    "[ gdef ] to complete the model , we must also specify the gravitational potential . in order to match the flat rotation curves found in real galaxies , we adopt the softened isothermal sphere potential , ( r ) = ( 1 + ) [ psidef ]    the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ losvd ] show the losvd as a function of projected radius and the tangential velocity distribution as a function of radius for this model .",
    "the model does , indeed , look very similar to the losvds seen in the stellar kinematics of real edge - on disk galaxies ( e.g. kuijken , fisher & merrifield 1996 ) .",
    "the lower panels show the parts of these two functions that lie `` above '' the rotation curve . for the reasons discussed in section  [ edgeonsec ] , these two plots appear similar , allowing us to use the bottom right panel as our initial approximation for the bottom left panel .",
    "we have applied the algorithm described in section  [ edgeonsec ] to a model of the form given by eqs .",
    "( [ dfdef ] ) , ( [ betadef ] ) , ( [ gdef ] ) and ( [ psidef ] ) for a variety of sets of parameters . figure  [ approxlosvd ] illustrates the case for parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "as this figure shows , the iterative algorithm recovers the df very closely .",
    "in fact , convergence occurs in a small number of steps .",
    "the only remaining discrepancies between the `` observed '' losvds and those produced by projecting the recovered df occur at very small values of @xmath20 , due to numerical noise in the integration process .",
    "thus far , we have assumed that we know the gravitational potential in our reconstruction of the df .",
    "such an assumption is reasonable if modelling a disk galaxy containing gas from which an emission - line rotation curve can be obtained .",
    "however , such information would not be available for a purely stellar system such as an s0 galaxy .",
    "further , we are also interested in addressing the more general question of whether the gravitational potential is uniquely specified by the observable stellar kinematics , or whether one can derive equally - plausible distribution functions using different assumptions about the form of the potential .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ losvd ] that there is no obvious way to estimate the rotation curve from the observed losvds : the combination of asymmetric drift in the stellar kinematics and the effects of projection along the line of sight means that the local circular speed does not correspond to any simple property of the stellar kinematics such as the peak of the losvd or the mean line - of - sight velocity of the stars .",
    "we are therefore , in principle , free to choose a different rotation curve and hence gravitational potential",
    ".    figures  [ v2.1 ] and  [ v1.9 ] show what happens in practice if we do so . for these model calculations",
    ", we have adopted a gravitational potential that differs only fairly marginally from the true form .",
    "the iterative process again converges rapidly to a plausible df , which reproduces the losvds exactly for @xmath58 .",
    "however , the losvds that one predicts from the derived df for @xmath59 bear little resemblance to those of the original galaxy model .",
    "thus , it would appear that the exact form of the gravitational potential is tightly constrained by the observations : using just the high - velocity kinematics , one can reconstruct the full df consistent with any given gravitational potential , but the low - velocity tails of the losvds will only be correctly reproduced if the correct potential is adopted .",
    "the ultimate goal of dynamical astronomy is the derivation of all that there is to know about a galaxy s dynamics from its observable kinematics .",
    "we are still clearly a long way from attaining this `` holy grail , '' but the analysis of this paper does provide some cause for optimism . specifically , we have shown how the distribution function of a relatively simple model galaxy can be estimated directly from its observed kinematics , using a straightforward iterative scheme .",
    "further , the redundancy of information in the kinematics means that one can readily rule out models in which the wrong gravitational potential has been adopted .",
    "the success of this iterative scheme seems to derive from the fact that the information available from the losvd of an edge - on disk is very similar to that available for inclined disks , for which the inversion to the df is already well established ( merrifield & kuijken 1994 , pichon & thibaut 1998 ) .",
    "thus , perhaps rather surprisingly , this problem does not appear significantly more ill - conditioned than the simpler case of the inclined disk , even though an extra integral is involved .",
    "the most tempting practical application for this technique is the study of edge - on s0 galaxies , since such objects are fairly pure stellar disks , which are believed to contain little by way of obscuration by dust .",
    "there are , however , still several obstacles to such an analysis . for a start ,",
    "s0 galaxies also contain a central spheroidal bulge component , so any attempt to reproduce their kinematics must include a suitable dynamical bulge model .",
    "in addition , even the disk components of these systems are not infinitely thin , so they probably also obey a third integral of motion .",
    "the simplest models would treat the dependence on this third integral as a separable function , but there is no reason why real galaxies should follow such simple models .",
    "finally , the data that one obtains for real galaxies will be noisy .",
    "the derivation of losvds from the broadening of spectral lines is a fundamentally noise amplifying process , so even good quality data will contain significant noise contribution .",
    "further , in the case of the algorithm presented in this paper , we principally use only the data from the high velocity side of the losvd , which will not span a large range in velocities .",
    "we will therefore have to obtain rather high dispersion spectra to determine this function , resulting in a further cost in terms of noise .",
    "however , the advent of 8-metre class telescopes means that the high quality data required for such analyses should soon be routinely available .",
    "also in its favour , the method works directly with the observed losvd rather than the moments calculated from it .",
    "even the second moment of the velocity distribution is very sensitive to noise , so a method that avoids calculating such moments is likely to be relatively robust .",
    "we can also draw on sophisticated abel inversion techniques , such as those developed by pichon & thibaut ( 1998 ) , to minimize any noise amplification .",
    "clearly , the next step in this project should be to apply these techniques to real data .",
    "preliminary df reconstructions based on losvds obtained from observed spectra of edge - on s0 galaxies indicate that the algorithm presented in this paper can be applied to real data with attainable noise levels to yield an estimate of the underlying df ; we defer discussion of this development to a subsequent paper ( mathieu & merrifield , 2000 ) .",
    "it might therefore reasonably be hoped that the application of this approach to real kinematic data will provide a robust method for studying the detailed dynamics of disk galaxies .",
