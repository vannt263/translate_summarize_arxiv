    "it is these shears that help convert the large - scale solar poloidal field into a strong toroidal component .",
    "however , for young , rapidly - rotating , solar - type stars a fundamentally different dynamo may be in operation .",

    "* ) have shown that their reconstructed magnetic topologies have large regions of near - surface azimuthal field .",
    "these are interpreted as the toroidal component of the large - scale dynamo field in the stars .",
    "the presence of these regions near the stellar surface has led to the belief that the dynamo operating in such stars is in fact distributed throughout the stellar convective zone , rather than being restricted to the interface layer as in the solar case .",
    "differential rotation is still thought to play a role in the generation of magnetic fields in these stars , however how the dynamos in these stars operates is not well understood .",
    "most theoretical models are based on our knowledge of the solar dynamo .",
    "the models of @xcite predict that the level of differential rotation on an early - g star should be greater than that on a mid - k star and that the level of surface differential rotation should decrease for stars with shorter rotational periods . while the models of @xcite also show that the level of differential rotation on a star should be dependent upon its effective temperature ( with hotter stars having higher levels of differential rotation ) but only weakly dependent on its rotation rate .",
    "these are predictions that we can now observationally test .",
    "there are several techniques we can use to observationally measure the level of differential rotation on a star .",

    "combining differential rotation measurements of a number of young solar - type stars , found using the doppler imaging method , @xcite found that the level of differential rotation increases with stellar temperature with early - g stars having higher levels of differential rotation than lower - mass stars , in agreement with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results also showed only a weak ( if any ) correlation with stellar rotation rate , again in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "however , more recent measurements of the young early - g star hd 171488 @xcite have shown this star to have an even higher level of differential rotation than that indicated by @xcite with differential rotation measurements up to 10 times the current solar value .",
    "this supports the findings of @xcite which show high levels of differential rotation on a number of f stars .",
    "work by @xcite has shown that for some early - k stars the level of differential rotation measured from surface brightness features is consistently lower than that measured from the magnetic features ( using the same dataset ) .",
    "this has led them to surmise that this is a result of the magnetic and brightness features being anchored at different depths within the stellar convective zone and that the convective zone has a radially varying differential rotation structure , unlike the sun .",
    "the work also showed that these early - k stars evidence temporal variation in their levels of differential rotation that the authors attribute to a feed - back mechanism in the stellar dynamo periodically converting magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice - versa .",
    "as mentioned there is currently only one early - g star for which there are differential rotation measures from both brightness and magnetic features obtained at multiple epochs , hd 171488 @xcite .",
    "this work has shown very little difference in the level of differential rotation measured from the magnetic and brightness features , although the measurement errors are larger than that found on the early - k stars @xcite . additionally , there appears to be little evidence of temporal evolution in the level of differential rotation on hd 171488 .",
    "this has been speculated to be caused by the thinner convective zone of hd 171488 compared to that of the early - k stars previously studied .    in order to expand the number of young early - g stars studied with spectropolarimetry this paper along with the first paper in the series (",
    "* ? ? ? * paper i ) and @xcite , presents differential rotation measurements , and magnetic maps , of two young early - g pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars .",

    "this paper ( paper ii ) presents the coronal magnetic field reconstructions , h@xmath1 activity and differential rotation measurements of hd 141943 .",
    "the third paper in the series @xcite deals with observations of hd 106506 .    as detailed in paper i",

    "the differential rotation rate found for hd 14143 is one of the largest yet found using the doppler imaging method and is similar to that of the other young early - g star hd 171488 @xcite .",
    "it is also similar in level to that of the more mature planet - hosting late - f star tau boo @xcite and is in agreement with the findings of high levels of differential rotation on inactive f stars by @xcite using the line - profile method to measure differential rotation .",
    "however , the level of differential rotation for hd 141943 and hd 171488 are significantly above that of the other young early - g stars studied using the doppler imaging method ( see table  [ tab_gstars ] )",
    ". there appears to be little differences between the stars to explain the differences in differential rotation with the possible exception of their convective zone depth .",
    "@xcite have shown that generally differential rotation increases with stellar effective temperature , however , their dataset does not have any stars with a differential rotation greater than @xmath6 @xmath0 0.2 rad d@xmath7 . as an extension of the work of @xcite we have plotted the differential rotation measured using the ( zeeman ) doppler imaging technique for these stars plus the additional stars listed in table  [ tab_gstars ] ( hd141943 , hd 106506 and hd 171488 ) . fig .",

    "a value has been used with error bars large enough to encompass the entire range of the observations . ]    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_czddr ] the level of differential rotation does appear to increase slightly with decreasing convection zones depth ( with some scatter ) until the convective zone depth reaches @xmath00.2 r@xmath9 ( early - g stars ) and then a dramatic increase in the level of surface differential rotation occurs .",
    "why this should be is still not understood , but it appears that a change occurs in the rotation of the convective zone at this depth . as suggested by @xcite , for stars with thinner convective zones , such as hd 141943",
    ", we may be seeing closer to the base of the convective zone and this could explain the higher levels of differential rotation seen on these stars .",
    "results from @xcite have shown that for early - k stars the differential rotation measured from magnetic features is higher than that measured from brightness features .",
    "they attribute this to the brightness and magnetic features being anchored at different depths in the stellar convective zone and the convective zone having a radially varying differential rotation ( unlike the sun ) . @xcite and @xcite found that there is virtually no change ( within errors ) in the differential rotation measured from brightness and magnetic features for the early - g star hd 171488 although the errors in the differential rotation measurements are , for the most part , much larger than the errors for the early - k stars . although their stokes v differential rotation measurements are for the most part higher than those measured from stokes i. hd 106506 @xcite also shows only a small increase in the differential rotation from magnetic features over that from brightness features , but again the difference is within the errors of the measurements .",
    "in contrast to this our 2010 results for hd 141943 show a large difference between the differential rotation measured from the brightness features compared to that measured from the magnetic features , with the magnetic differential rotation being significantly higher than that from the brightness features .",
    "one possible reason for this difference could be the different latitude distributions of the brightness and magnetic features on hd 141943 . in 2010",
    "the spot features of hd 141943 are concentrated in a minor polar spot and some lower latitude features , while the magnetic features are more evenly distributed over the entire hemisphere ( see fig .  5 in paper",
    "such a difference in distribution may possibly lead to biases in the determination of the differential rotation , as the differential rotation is determined over a smaller ( or larger ) latitude range .",
    "both hd 106506 and hd 171488 have larger polar spots and less low - latitude spot features than hd 141943 .",
    "thus , the two stars with more dominant polar spots would be expected to more affected by any bias in the latitude distribution between brightness and magnetic features , but neither star shows any significant disparity in differential rotation .",
    "the reason why hd 141943 alone shows a disparity in the differential rotation measurements between brightness and magnetic features remains unknown .",
    "a larger sample size is required to determine if hd 141943 is just a unique case .    unlike the results from early - k stars @xcite the early - g star hd 171488 shows no evidence of temporal evolution in its level of differential rotation @xcite although again the errors are larger than the level of variation seen on early - k stars .",
    "our magnetic results from 2007 and 2010 for hd 141943 show a slight difference ( see section  [ sec_sdr ] ) but with only a @xmath02@xmath10 change this is only rather tentative evidence for temporal evolution in the star s differential rotation . the temporal variability seen on early - k stars is seen as evidence of a dynamo that periodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy , and vise - versa , in the stellar convective zone .",
    "if such a mechanism is occurring in early - g stars ( with thinner convective zones ) it does not appear to have a large impact on the level of their differential rotation , although the errors in our differential rotation measures are too great to rule out a level of variability similar to that seen on early - k stars .    due to the rapid winding of magnetic field lines most likely to occur on stars with high levels of differential rotation , it is possible that such stars could have significantly shorter magnetic cycles than the 22-year solar magnetic cycle .",
    "indeed the late - f star tau boo does in fact appear to have a very short magnetic cycle ( of @xmath02 years , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this star is also the host to a `` hot jupiter '' @xcite which may also be affecting its magnetic cycle length .",
    "both the early - g stars hd 141943 and hd 171488 have similar levels of differential rotation to that of tau boo and do not show any evidence of a magnetic polarity reversal over @xmath03 years of observations @xcite .",
    "so the role of differential rotation in the magnetic cycles ( or if they even have cycles ) of these young stars is still unknown .",
    "[ cor_struct ] shows the structure of the coronal magnetic field and also of the x - ray emission for the 2007 , 2009 and 2010 magnetic maps ( see paper i ) .",
    "open field lines that would be x - ray dark and carrying the stellar wind , are shown blue , while the x - ray bright closed field lines are shown white .",
    "on the largest scales , the dipole component of the field dominates and the field structure for the three years is similar .",
    "the main change on the large scale is in the tilt of the dipole component of the field . between 2007 and 2009 ,",
    "the dipole axis shifted from a latitude of 68 degrees to down to 52 degrees and then back to 72 in 2010 . on smaller scales , the field structure is very different between the three years and this is reflected in the x - ray images .",
    "as noted in paper i the poor quality of the 2009 dataset may play some role in these results .",
    "[ cor_mod ] shows the magnitude and rotational modulation of the emission measure , and also the emission - measure weighted density : @xmath11 these are calculated for a range of values of the base pressure , since without simultaneous x - ray observations we are unable to determine the value of base pressure .",
    "we also show in the left column results for a model with a small corona ( extending to 2.5 r@xmath9 ) and in the right column results for a model with a larger corona ( extending to 4.8 r@xmath9 ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the small changes introduced by uncertainty in the size of the corona are small compared to the changes between years .",
    "we expect the corona to be populated with loops at a range of temperatures , but in the absence of any data that might determine the nature of the differential emission measure , we take the simplest approach .",
    "we therefore show results for a corona at a uniform temperature of 2@xmath1210@xmath13 k and for comparison , one at a uniform temperature of 2@xmath1210@xmath14 k.    as might be expected , at the lower temperatures , the densities and emission measures reach higher values .",
    "the range of values is however similar for all years and is typical for active stars .",
    "the largest difference between the three years is in the arrangement of the smaller scale loops and this results in a significant increase in the x - ray rotational modulation in 2009 .",
    "we have extrapolated the coronal magnetic field of hd 141943 from surface magnetograms acquired at 3 epochs .",
    "these show that the large - scale field structure of the corona is dominated by a dipole component with the axis of the dipole shifting between the 3 epochs .",
    "the small scale structure shows an increase in the modelled rotational x - ray modulation in 2009 , compared to the other epochs ( 2007 & 2010 ) .",
    "the surface differential rotation of hd 141943 has been measured at 2 epochs ( 2007 & 2010 ) from both the surface brightness features ( 2010 ) and the surface magnetic features ( 2007 & 2010 ) .",
    "the differential rotation measured from the magnetic features is one of the highest values of differential rotation measured on a young solar - type star and is similar in level to the other young early - g star hd 171488 , but higher than the more swollen star hd 106506 .",
    "we thus conclude that the depth of the stellar convective zone plays a strong role in the level of surface differential rotation seen on solar - type stars , with a large increase in differential rotation seen for star s with convective zone depths shallower than @xmath00.2 r@xmath9 .",
    "the 2010 dataset for hd 141943 shows a large increase in the level of differential rotation measured from magnetic features to that measured from brightness features .",
    "this is similar to that seen on early - k stars but with a much greater difference and is in contrast to the results from other early - g stars which show little or no difference between the differential rotation measured from brightness and magnetic features .",
    "our results only find tentative evidence for temporal evolution in the differential rotation of hd 141943 .",
    "these results when combined with those from the early - g star hd 171488 ( which shows no evidence of temporal evolution in differential rotation ) imply that early - g stars do not undergo large - scale evolution in their differential rotation .",
    "however , the errors in our measurements are too large to rule out small scale evolution in differential rotation similar to that seen on early - k stars .",
    "hd 141943 and stars of similar spectral type warrant further observations to determine what effect a shallow convective zone has on the differential rotation levels of such stars and indeed if they do show temporal evolution of their differential rotation as seen on early - k stars .",
    "the observations in this paper were obtained with the anglo - australian telescope .",
    "we would like to thank the technical staff of the anglo - australian observatory ( now the australian astronomical observatory ) for their , as usual , excellent assistance during these observations .",
    "we would also like to thank the anonymous referee who helped improve this paper .",
    "this project is supported by the commonwealth of australia under the international science linkages program .",
