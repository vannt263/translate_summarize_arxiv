    "<S> shell model calculations reveal that the ground and low - lying yrast states of the @xmath0 nuclei @xmath1pd and @xmath2cd are mainly built upon isoscalar spin - aligned neutron - proton pairs each carrying the maximum angular momentum @xmath3 allowed by the shell @xmath4 which is dominant in this nuclear region . </S>",
    "<S> this mode of excitation is unique in nuclei and indicates that the spin - aligned pair has to be considered as an essential building block in nuclear structure calculations . in this contribution we will discuss this neutron - proton pair coupling scheme in detail . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will explore the competition between the normal monopole pair coupling and the spin - aligned coupling schemes . </S>",
    "<S> such a coupling may be useful in elucidating the structure properties of @xmath0 and neighboring nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying structures of many nuclei can be understood as the outcome of the competition between the pairing ( or seniority ) coupling scheme and the aligned coupling of individual particles in a non - spherical average potential . </S>",
    "<S> the seniority coupling dominates the low - lying states of semi - magic nuclei , where the driving force behind is the strong pairing interaction between like particles </S>",
    "<S> . meanwhile , many open - shell nuclei have quadrupole moments that are much larger than could be attributed to a single particle , which implies the sharing of angular momentum between many particles . </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable feature of nuclear structure physics is that essential ingredients of the single - particle model could be retained by assuming that the nucleons move in an average nuclear field deviates from spherical symmetry , which removes the spurious degrees of freedom corresponding to the collective spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between there two couplings in open - shell nuclei is expected to be rather fast @xcite .    near the @xmath5 line </S>",
    "<S> , nuclear collectivity may be further enhanced by the interactions arising between neutrons and protons occupying orbitals with the same quantum numbers , which can form @xmath6 pairs with angular momenta @xmath7 to @xmath8 and isospin quantum numbers @xmath9 ( isoscalar ) and @xmath10 ( isovector ) . </S>",
    "<S> the isovector @xmath6 channel manifests itself in a fashion similar to like - nucleon correlations . </S>",
    "<S> there has been longstanding and intensive interest in exploring the signature of isoscalar @xmath6 pairing ( in particular @xmath6 pairs with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) in the structure of self - conjugate nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possible fingerprints may be inferred from the delayed alignments in the ground - state rotational bands of deformed @xmath0 nuclei , but it is still controversial . in this contribution we would like to discuss the so - called spin - aligned neutron - proton pair coupling from a nuclear shell - model perspective . in some spherical @xmath0 nuclei it may overcome the normal pairing as the dominant coupling scheme of the ground state structure . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the aligned @xmath6 pairs can generate striking regular evolution patterns in the energy spectra and transition probabilities along the yrast states of @xmath0 nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> these may be deemed as a new kind of collective mode with isoscalar character that is unique in the atomic nucleus . in a recent work </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying yrast states in @xmath1pd were observed and it was inferred that for the first time a transition from the isovector pair coupling mode to such spin - aligned @xmath6 coupling scheme may have occurred  @xcite . for related earlier works , see refs . </S>",

    "<S> i would like to remind you that , as one would expect , near the closed shell nucleus @xmath13sn , i.e. , in @xmath2pd ( @xmath14cd ) with four ( two ) proton holes outside of @xmath13sn , the positions of the energy levels correspond to a @xmath15 pairing spectrum , as can be seen from fig . 1 of ref . @xcite and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ ru88 ] . </S>",
    "<S> when the number of neutron holes increases , the levels tend to be equally separated , which is a characteristic of vibrational spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this are specially the cases for @xmath16pd and @xmath2cd which show equally - spaced level schemes up to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> already the systematics of experimental data suggests gradual decrements in both the quadrupole deformation @xmath19 and @xmath20 ratio in @xmath0 nuclei when approaching the @xmath13sn shell closure @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , it is suggested that the apparent collectivity in the spectrum of @xmath16pd may have a different origin than that resulting from a vibration or rotational motion usually attached to nuclear collective phenomena @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since there is no evidence for shell interferences in the spectra of pd isotopes , we will analyze other sources which control the structure of those spectra , namely the different coupled pair modes . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done rather easily in this case where the shell @xmath4 is very dominant , by considering separately the various components of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we found that when the @xmath9 @xmath6 interaction is switched off , the corresponding spectrum is of seniority type . </S>",

    "<S> , one may argue that the corresponding energies vary approximately linearly with @xmath70 for small total angular momenta , inducing similar energy spacings between consecutive levels .    to gain deeper physical insight into the structure of @xmath16pd we also calculated the numbers of isovector pairs which are plotted in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ num ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that already in the ground state we have much more pairs with @xmath75 than the normal @xmath7 pair . in particular , the dominating component is the @xmath33 pair which is maximally aligned in the isovector channel . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the large overlap between states generated by the spin - aligned @xmath6 pairs and those generated by the isovector pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is not seen in systems with two @xmath6 pairs where the contributions from the isovector aligned pair is practically zero for low - lying yrast states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that the dominating component in the wave functions of low - lying yrast states in @xmath16pd is still the spin - aligned @xmath6 pair coupling . </S>",

    "<S> it is thus found that , among the various aligned np pair configurations , the dominating components can be well represented by a single configuration @xmath86 . in the @xmath4 shell , this configuration is calculated to occupy around 66% of the ground state wave function of @xmath16pd , i.e. , with amplitude @xmath87 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also it should be mentioned that the @xmath3 term is not the generator for the full aligned np coupling . </S>",
    "<S> it only generates the stretch configuration @xcite shown above . </S>",

    "<S> it is seen that there is indeed a triplet of states in the calculated spectrum which are nearly degenerate and lie at twice the energy of the state @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the vibrational model predicts that the e2 transitions from the two - phonon states to the state @xmath90 should all have the same strength and its value should be twice that of the @xmath91 strength . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction differs very much from the calculated values for the aligned coupling scheme shown in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the strength of the @xmath92 transition is one order of magnitude smaller than the predicted value for a vibrator . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to the fact that the calculated second @xmath24 state contain large contributions from shells ( in particular the @xmath93 shell ) other than the @xmath4 shell . </S>",
    "<S> that is , this state does not correspond to the spin - aligned @xmath6 coupling scheme proposed in this work . </S>",
