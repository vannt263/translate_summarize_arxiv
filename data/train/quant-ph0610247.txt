    "nonlocality without inequalities arguments , like the celebrated greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz )  @xcite and hardy s  @xcite ones , may provide evidence of the genuine nonlocal features of certain quantum states without resorting to the consideration of bell - like inequalities  @xcite .",
    "the experimental verification of the implications of such arguments does not require one to collect data of several correlation functions but it simply demands one to test the occurrence of certain joint measurement outcomes .",
    "more precisely , in the case of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger argument one has to verify the existence of perfect ( anti)correlations between the outcomes of dichotomic measurements performed on to each of a group of three spacelike separated particles  @xcite , while in the case of hardy s proof one has to put into evidence the occurrence of a single joint event  @xcite .",
    "such experiments usually involve groups of polarization - entangled photons and the most reliable source of ( multipartite ) entanglement is represented by parametric down conversion processes  @xcite",
    ". however , in practice , the pure states exhibiting nonlocal effects one wishes to prepare in a laboratory in this way ( the tripartite ghz state and the hardy states , which are bipartite state vectors whose schmidt decomposition involves at least two different weights ) are unavoidably subjected to different kinds of noise .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how it is possible to generalize the original hardy s proof  @xcite by following techniques which are similar to those we used in refs .",
    "@xcite and to apply it to specific one - parameter classes of statistical operators , representing mixtures of hardy states with a completely chaotic noise ( also known as a white noise ) or with a colored noise .",
    "while the first kind of noise the one which is usually considered in the literature for nonlocality experiments , the second kind has been recently pointed out to be the best ( and more realistic ) choice for describing what really happens in type ii spontaneous parametric down conversion processes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will determine the range of values of the parameter which measures the amount of noise affecting the nonoptimal preparation of a definite ( pure ) hardy state , for which it is still possible that the resulting mixed state exhibits genuine and testable nonlocal effects .",
    "equivalently , our work exhibits particular classes of bipartite mixed states whose constituents do not admit any local and deterministic hidden variable model which may consistently be in agreement with the quantum mechanical predictions , and which are , as a consequence , nonseparable ( that is , they can not be expressed as a convex sum of product states ) .",
    "as already remarked on , the techniques we use are similar to those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite but some results are improved because in this paper we exploit the explicit form of the noise corrupting a hardy state , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the form of the mixed states we were considering was left unspecified for the sake of generality .",
    "in ordinary quantum mechanics , given the state vector associated to a physical system , the outcomes of ( single and joint ) measurement processes of arbitrary observables may be only statistically predicted and , apart from particular situations , such outcomes are not certain . however , there still exists the ( logical ) possibility that the quantum states do not represent the maximal possible knowledge one can have about a quantum system .",
    "in such a situation , supplementary variables might very well predetermine the outcomes of any quantum measurement and the stochastic aspects of quantum mechanics would arise since what one can know is only the probabilistic distribution of these additional variables for this reason they are referred to as hidden variables .    accordingly , the hypothetical theory ( called stochastic hidden variable model ) which completes quantum mechanics consists of ( i ) a set @xmath0 , whose elements @xmath1 are the hidden variables ; ( ii ) a normalized probability distribution @xmath2 defined on @xmath0 ; ( iii ) a set of probability distributions @xmath3 for the outcomes of single and joint measurements of any conceivable set of observables @xmath4 , where each index of the set @xmath5 refers to a single particle or to a group of all the particles , such that @xmath6 the quantity at the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq0.1 ] ) is the quantum mechanical ( joint ) probability distribution for the set of outcomes @xmath7 of the considered measurements when the system is in the state @xmath8 .",
    "a deterministic hidden variable model , which is also known as a realistic model , is a particular instance of a hidden variable model where all probabilities @xmath9 take the values @xmath10 or @xmath11 only . in this case , the measurement outcomes of arbitrary observables are predetermined .",
    "a hidden variable model is called local  @xcite if the following factorizability condition holds for any conceivable joint probability distribution @xmath12 and for any value of the hidden variable @xmath13 @xmath14 in all cases in which the measurement processes for the observables @xmath15 occur at spacelike separated locations .",
    "the locality condition imposes that no causal influence can exist between spacelike separated events . since deterministic and stochastic hidden variable models",
    "are totally equivalent when the locality condition is imposed  @xcite , and since in what follows we will focus only on realistic models , all the probabilities @xmath9 will consequently be assumed to take the values @xmath10 and @xmath11 only .",
    "a hardy state @xmath16 belonging to @xmath17 is any entangled state whose schmidt decomposition with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath18 , involves two ( strictly positive ) different weights @xmath19 so that @xmath20 thus , the hardy states of eq .",

    "such a statistical operator represents the state which usually results from an imperfect preparation of the ( pure ) hardy state @xmath36 in the practical realizations of nonlocality experiments .",
    "in fact , it is customary to mimic the noise which affects a nonperfectly controllable preparation of pure entangled states , like those of polarization - entangled photons produced by parametric down - conversion processes , as the output state of eq .",
    "( [ eq1.4 ] )  @xcite .",
    "in order to exhibit a proof of nonlocality without inequalities for the state @xmath8 by following the hardy s argument , we have to consider appropriate quantum mechanical probability distributions and to show that they can not be reproduced by local realistic hidden variable models . to this end",
    "let us briefly review the line of reasoning of ref .",

    "this quantity represents the crucial joint probability which allows one to establish the nonlocal features of any hardy state in the original formulation of the argument of nonlocality  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) .",
    "the usefulness of this result is twofold , both from the theoretical and from the experimental point of view , as can be immediately deduced by reversing the assertion of the previous theorem .",

    "such states are proven to be not separable , that is , they can not be decomposed as a convex sum of product states ( indeed , if they were separable a local realistic model for them would actually exist  @xcite ) .",
    "second , for the same values of @xmath39 , genuine nonlocal effects can be successfully revealed by experiments where joint measurements are performed by spacelike separated observers , despite the presence of a completely chaotic noise corrupting a pure hardy state .",

    "( [ eq1.4 ] ) and  ( [ eq3.1 ] ) , with respect to other existing criteria .",
    "in fact , besides hardy s proof , the usual way to reject local hidden variable models for a given quantum state consists in exhibiting a bell inequality which is violated by an appropriate choice of single - particle observables .",
    "for this purpose , and in the restricted scenario of a @xmath80 hilbert space , a necessary condition has been exhibited in ref .",

    "@xcite is more powerful than our generalized version of hardy s proof to deny the existence of local realistic models for the considered class of mixed states of eq .",
