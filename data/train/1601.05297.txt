    "the loewner transform is a natural way to encode certain two - dimensional paths by a one - dimensional continuous function , via a procedure that involves iterations of conformal maps .",
    "this idea has been introduced by loewner in 1923 @xcite in its radial form ( motivated by the bieberbach conjecture , and it eventually was an important tool in its solution @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also a natural chordal counterpart , when one encodes a simple curve from one boundary point to another instead of a simple curve from a boundary point to some inside point as in the radial case .",
    "let us briefly recall this chordal loewner description of a continuous simple curve @xmath6 from @xmath7 to infinity in the open upper half - plane @xmath8 .",
    "we parameterize the curve in such a way that the conformal map @xmath9 from @xmath10 $ ] onto @xmath8 with @xmath11 as @xmath12 satisfies in fact @xmath13 ( it is easy to see that it is always possible to reparameterize a continuous curve in such a way ) .",
    "it is also easy to check that one can extend @xmath9 by continuity to the boundary point @xmath14 and that the real - valued function @xmath15 is continuous .",
    "loewner s equation then shows that the function @xmath16 ( that is often referred to as the driving function of @xmath6 ) does fully characterize the curve .",
    "the loewner energy ( we will also often just say `` the energy '' ) of this loewner chain is then defined to be the usual dirichlet energy of its driving function ( this quantity has been also introduced and considered in the very recent paper by friz and shekhar @xcite ) : @xmath17 this quantity does not need to be finite , but of course , for a certain class of sufficiently regular curves @xmath6 , @xmath18 is finite .",
    "conversely , as we shall explain , any real - valued function @xmath19 with finite energy does necessarily correspond to a simple curve @xmath6 .",
    "it is immediate to check that if one considers the simple curve @xmath20 instead of @xmath6 for some @xmath21 , then @xmath22 .",
    "this scale - invariance property of the energy makes it possible to define the energy @xmath23 of any simple curve @xmath24 from a boundary point @xmath3 of a simply connected domain @xmath4 to another boundary point @xmath5 to be the energy of the conformal image of @xmath24 via any uniformizing map @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( as it will not depend on the actual choice of @xmath25 ) .",
    "for such a simple curve @xmath24 , one can define its time - reversal @xmath28 that has the same trace as @xmath24 , but which is viewed as going from @xmath5 to @xmath3 .",
    "the first main contribution of the present paper is to prove the following reversibility result :    [ main1 ] the loewner energy of the time - reversal @xmath28 of a simple curve @xmath24 from @xmath3 to @xmath5 in @xmath4 is equal to the loewner energy of @xmath24 : @xmath29 .",
    "note that if @xmath6 is a curve from @xmath7 to infinity in the upper half - plane , then @xmath30 is a curve from @xmath31 to @xmath7 in the upper half - plane , but if we view it after time - reversal , one gets again curve from @xmath7 to infinity .",
    "an equivalent formulation of the theorem is that the dirichlet energy of the driving function of this curve is necessarily equal to that of the driving function of @xmath6 .",
    "a naive guess would indicate that this simple statement must have a straightforward proof , but this seems not to be the case .",
    "indeed , the definition of the curve @xmath6 out of @xmath19 via iterations of conformal maps is very `` directional '' and not well - suited to time - reversal .",
    "as it turns out , the way in which the energy of the driving function @xmath19 of @xmath6 will be redistributed on the driving function of its time - reversal is highly non - local and rather intricate .",
    "this suggest that a more symmetric reinterpretation of the energy of the loewner chain will be handy in order to prove this theorem  and this is indeed the strategy that we will follow .",
    "the reader acquainted to schramm loewner evolutions ( sle ) may have noted features reminiscent of part of the sle theory . recall that chordal sle@xmath0 as defined by schramm in @xcite is the random curve that one obtains when one chooses the driving function to be @xmath32 times a one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "this is of course a function with infinite energy , but brownian motion and dirichlet energy are not unrelated ( and we will comment on this a few lines ) .",
    "recall also from @xcite that ( and this is a non - trivial fact ) chordal sle@xmath0 is indeed a simple curve when @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , given that sle@xmath0 curves should conjecturally arise as scaling limits of lattice based models from statistical physics , it was natural to conjecture that chordal sle is reversible ie .",
    "that the time - reversal of a chordal sle@xmath0 from @xmath3 to @xmath5 in @xmath4 is a chordal sle@xmath0 from @xmath5 to @xmath3 in @xmath4 ( note that here , this means an identity in distribution between two random curves ) .",
    "proving this has turned out to be a challenge that resisted for some years , but has been settled by zhan @xcite in the case of the simple curves @xmath34 $ ] , via rather non - trivial couplings of both ends of the path ( see also dubdat s commutation relations @xcite , miller and sheffield s approach based on the gaussian free field @xcite that also provides a proof of reversibility for the non - simple case where @xmath35 $ ] , or friz and shekhar @xcite for an approach based on rough paths that also use the loewner energy ) . in view of theorem [ main1 ] , one may actually wonder if a possible roadmap towards proving reversibility of sle is to deduce it from the reversibility of the loewner energy for smooth curves @xmath6",
    ". our approach in the present paper will however be precisely the opposite ; we will namely use the reversibility of the sle@xmath0 curves as a tool to deduce the reversibility of the energy of smooth curves .",
    "one way to relate brownian motion to dirichlet energy is to view the latter as the large deviation functional for paths with small brownian component .",
    "recall that the law of one - dimensional brownian motion on @xmath36 $ ] translated by a function @xmath37 with @xmath38 is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of brownian motion if and only if @xmath39 is finite ( the space of such function is called the cameron - martin space ) .",
    "in particular , if we set @xmath40 for all continuous functions in the complement of the cameron - martin space , then @xmath41 is also the rate function for the large deviation principle on brownian paths in the classical schilder theorem @xcite .",
    "this loosely speaking means that @xmath42 measures the exponential decay rate for @xmath43 times a brownian motion to be in a small neighborhood of the path @xmath37 .",
    "our proof of theorem [ main1 ] is based on the fact that the energy of the loewner chain is the large deviation rate function of the sle@xmath0 driving function when @xmath44 .",
    "loosely speaking , for a given @xmath6 with finite energy , we want to relate @xmath45 to the decay as @xmath46 of the probability for an sle@xmath0 to be in a certain neighborhood @xmath47 of @xmath6 via a formula of the type @xmath48\\right).\\ ] ] the main point will be to prove this for a reversible notion of @xmath49 ( so that a path is in the @xmath50-neighborhood of @xmath6 if and only if its time - reversal is in the @xmath50-neighborhood of the time - reversal of @xmath6 ) .",
    "once this will be done , the reversibility of the energy of the loewner chain will follow immediately from this expression and the reversibility of sle@xmath0 for all small @xmath2 .",
    "usual neighborhoods are not so well - suited for our purpose : taking the neighborhood of @xmath51 in the sense of some hausdorff metric in the upper half - plane is not well - adapted to the large deviation framework for the driving function , and the @xmath52 norm on the driving function does not define reversible neighborhoods .",
    "our choice will be to fix a finite number of points on the left side and the right side of @xmath51 , and to consider the collection of driving functions whose loewner transform passes on the same side of these points than @xmath51 does .",
    "this set of driving functions will play the role of @xmath53 and the large deviation principle will apply well ( the @xmath54 limit will be replaced by letting the set of constraint points become dense in the upper half - plane ) . in order to properly apply the convergence , we will use some considerations about compactness of the set of @xmath55-quasiconformal curves , and the relation between finite energy chains and quasiconformal curves .    in this paper",
    ", we will use basic concepts from the theory of quasiconformal maps , the loewner equation , schilder s large deviation theorem , sle curves and some of their properties .",
    "we of course refer to the basic corresponding textbooks for background , but we choose to briefly and heuristically recall some of the basic definitions and results that we use , in order to help the readers in case some part of this background material does not belong to their everyday toolbox .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows : we will first derive in section [ sec_finite_curve ] some facts on deterministic loewner chains with finite energy and their regularity . in section [ sec_minimizing_curve_finite ] , we derive theorem [ main1 ] using the strategy that we have just outlined , and we conclude in section [ commentssection ] establishing some connections with ideas from sle restriction properties and sle commutation relations . in upcoming work , we plan to address generalizations and consequences of the present work to the case of full - plane curves , loops and more general graphs",

    "note that our project was developed independently of @xcite .",
    "let us list a few properties of this energy :    * the map @xmath115 is lower - semicontinuous .",

    "similarly , we define _ the energy _ of @xmath51 driven by @xmath37 as @xmath124 for @xmath125 ( endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on compact intervals ) .",
    "we still have that @xmath126 is lower semicontinuous , and the set of functions such that @xmath127 is compact in @xmath128 .",

    "thus , the energy is invariant under conformal equivalence preserving @xmath134 .",
    "so one can define the loewner energy of a curve from a boundary point @xmath3 to another boundary point @xmath5 in a simply connected domain @xmath4 , by applying any conformal map from @xmath26 to @xmath135 .",
    "we use @xmath136 to indicate the energy in a different domain than @xmath135 . *",
    "it is also straightforward to see that the loewner energy satisfies the simple additivity property @xmath137 using the fact that the driving function of @xmath138 is @xmath139 . *",
    "if one is looking for a functional of a loewner chain that satisfies additivity and conformal invariance , one is therefore looking for additive functionals of the driving functions with the right scaling property .",
    "there are of course several options ( for instance one can add to @xmath41 the integral of the absolute value of the second derivative of @xmath120 to the appropriate power ) .",
    "however , taking the integral of the square of the derivative is the most natural choice  and it does satisfy the reversibility property that we derive in the present paper .",
    "* let us finally remark that a loewner chain with @xmath7 energy is driven by the @xmath7 function , hence is the imaginary axis in @xmath56 which is the conformal geodesic between @xmath7 and @xmath31 . in view of the conformal invariance",

    "it may seem at first that the definition of the dirichlet energy is quite ad hoc and depends on our choice of uniformizing domain for the loewner flow ( the fact that one works in the upper half - plane ) .",
    "let us briefly indicate that this is not the case .",
    "suppose for instance that we are working in the simply connected domain @xmath4 , and that @xmath140 is a smooth analytic arc in the neighborhood of @xmath5 .",

    "then the driving function defined as @xmath153 corresponds exactly to the driving function of the image by @xmath146 of the curve in the half - plane .",
    "so , one can express the energy of the loewner chain directly in terms of the integral of the square of the variation of @xmath154 when parameterized as explained above ie . of quantities that are naturally and directly defined in @xmath4 .",
    "the following result will explain that a loewner chain with finite energy is necessarily a simple curve :    [ prop_finite_curve ] for every @xmath37 with finite energy , there exists @xmath155 , depending only on @xmath156 , such that the trace of loewner transform @xmath51 of @xmath37 is a @xmath55-quasiconformal curve , the image of @xmath157 by a @xmath55-quasiconformal mapping preserving @xmath56 , @xmath7 and @xmath31 .",
