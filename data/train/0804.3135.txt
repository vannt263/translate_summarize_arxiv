    "several observations , such as the type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite , wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite support an accelerating expanding universe .",
    "many cosmological models such as the quintessence @xcite , the braneworld cosmology@xcite , the chaplygin gas @xcite and the holographic dark energy models @xcite are extensively explored to explain the acceleration of the universe .",
    "one of the most common candidates is composed of cold dark matter with the equation of state @xmath4 and a cosmological constant @xmath1 with @xmath5 .",
    "it is usually called the @xmath1cdm cosmology @xcite , which is characterized by @xmath6,\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are proportion of the matter density , the cosmological constant and the curvature term respectively , and @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 is the current value of the hubble parameter .",
    "we can get the relation @xmath12 from eq.([eq1 ] ) by setting @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to an open , flat and closed universe respectively .",
    "one important task is to constrain the cosmological parameters of various cosmological models .",
    "using the luminosity distance measurements to a particular class of objects such as sne ia and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is the most frequently used method @xcite .",
    "x - ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters is also very popular @xcite . a different method based on the lookback time measurements and the age of the universe has been used to test the cosmological models @xcite . in addition , the size of the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak detected in the large - scale correlation function of luminous red galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data obtained from the three - year wmap estimate @xcite and the sne ia data which are newly released as the first - year result of the planned five - year supernova legacy survey ( snls ) are widely used to constrain cosmological models . recently , one method based on the observational @xmath0 data ( ohd for simplicity hereafter ) , which are related to the differential ages of the oldest galaxies , has been used to test cosmological models @xcite .    in this paper , we first examine the non - flat @xmath1cdm cosmology using the observational @xmath0 data , which can be derived from the derivative of redshift @xmath17 with respect to the cosmic time @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "we do the combinational analyses using observations of bao and cmb . we obtain a compatible result with many other independent cosmological probes .",
    "we find that the observational @xmath0 data are effective for cosmological constraints .",
    "we organize this paper as follows : in sec.2 , we briefly overview the observational @xmath0 data , the bao data and the cmb data . in sec.3",
    ", we present the constraints on the @xmath1cdm model . in sec.4 ,",
    "the conclusions and more discussions are given .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath0 depends on the differential ages of the universe in this form @xmath20 which provides a direct measurement for @xmath0 through a determination of @xmath21 . in the work of jimenez et al .",
    "@xcite , they demonstrated the feasibility of the method by applying it to a @xmath22 sample . in particular , sdss was used to determine @xmath23 and it was showed that its value was in good agreement with other independent methods . with the availability of new galaxy surveys , it becomes possible to determine @xmath0 at @xmath24 . by using the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies determined from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ) @xcite and archival data @xcite , simon et al .",
    "( 2005 ) @xcite derived a set of observational @xmath0 data .",
    "the data set was derived from the absolute ages of 32 passively evolving galaxies with high - quality spectroscopy .",
    "synthetic stellar population models were used to constrain the ages of the oldest stars in the galaxy ( after marginalising over the metallicity and star formation history ) , similar to the work of jimenez et al . @xcite .",
    "in order to estimate the differential ages , these galaxies were further divided into three subsamples .",
    "the first subsample was composed of 10 field early - type galaxies , after discarding galaxies for which the spectral fit indicated an extended star formation .",
    "the ages of this sample were derived using the speed models @xcite .",
    "the second subsample was composed of 20 old passive galaxies from gdds .",
    "they calculated the absolute ages using the speed models too , obtaining harmonious results with the gdds collaboration which estimated the ages using different models .",
    "the third subsample consisted of two red radio galaxies 53w091 and 53w069 @xcite .",
    "after grouping together all the galaxies within @xmath25 and excluding unperfect ones , they computed differential ages only for those bins within @xmath26 .",
    "the interval @xmath25 is set small in order to avoid incorporating galaxies that have already evolved in age , but large enough for the sparse sample to have more than one galaxy in most of the bins .",
    "the lower limit is imposed so that the age evolution between the two bins is larger than the error in the age determination .",
    "this provides a robust determination of @xmath27 .",
    "the differential ages are less sensitive to systematics errors than absolute ages @xcite .",
    "then a set of differential ages @xmath27 , equivalently @xmath0 , was obtained . as @xmath17 has a relatively wide range , @xmath28 ,",
    "these data are expected to provide a more full - scale description of the dynamical evolution of our universe .",
    "but what a pity , the data amount is not sufficient enough and the corresponding errors are quite large @xcite .",
    "these observational @xmath0 data have been used to constrain the dark energy potential and its redshift dependence by simon et al .",
    "@xcite . using this data",
    "set , one can constrain various cosmological models too .",
    "yi & zhang @xcite first used them to analyze the holography - inspired dark energy models in which the parameter @xmath29 plays a key role . the cases with @xmath30 and setting @xmath29 free are discussed in detail .",
    "the results are consistent with some other independent cosmological tests .",
    "samushia & ratra @xcite used the data set to constrain the parameters of @xmath1cdm , xcdm and @xmath31cdm models .",
    "wei & zhang @xcite compared a series of other cosmological models with interaction between dark matter and dark energy . and",
    "they find that the best models have an oscillating feature for both the hubble parameter and the equation of state .",
    "the acoustic peaks in the cmb anisotropy power spectrum has been found efficient to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite . as the acoustic oscillations in the relativistic plasma of the early universe will also be imprinted on to the late - time power spectrum of the non - relativistic matter @xcite",
    ", the acoustic signatures in the large - scale clustering of galaxies yield additional tests for cosmology .    using a large spectroscopic sample of 46748 luminous red galaxies covering 3816 square degrees out to @xmath32 from the sdss , eisenstein et al . @xcite",
    "successfully found the peaks , described by the model - independent @xmath33-parameter which is independent on @xmath23 , @xmath34^{1/3},\\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the redshift at which the acoustic scale has been measured , the function @xmath37 is defined as @xmath38 and the function @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 eisenstein et al . @xcite suggested the measured value of the @xmath2-parameter as @xmath41 .",
    "the shift parameter @xmath3 is perhaps the most model - independent parameter which can be derived from cmb data and it does not depend on @xmath23 .",
    "it is defined as @xcite @xmath42,\\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the redshift of recombination .",
    "from the three - year result of wmap @xcite , wang & mukherjee @xcite estimated the cmb shift parameter @xmath3 and showed that its measured value is mostly independent on assumptions about dark energy .",
    "the observational result is suggested as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "bao and cmb have been widely used to do combinational constraints on the cosmological parameters . in the work of guo",
    "@xcite , bao was used to constrain the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld cosmology and a closed universe is strongly favored .",
    "wu & yu @xcite combined bao with cmb to determine parameters of a dark energy model with @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "they suggested that a varying dark energy model and a crossing with @xmath5 are favored and the current value of @xmath46 is very likely less than -1 .",
    "pires et al .",
    "@xcite combined bao and the lookback time data to make a joint statistic analysis for the dgp braneworld cosmology and they suggested a closed universe .",
    "wang & mukherjee @xcite used the @xmath3 parameter , combing several other cosmological probes including bao , to derive model - independent constraints on the dark energy density and the hubble parameter .",
    "in this paper , we combine the observational @xmath0 data with bao and cmb to make a constraint on the @xmath1cdm cosmology .",
    "the best - fit parameters can be determined through the @xmath47 minimization method . for the non - flat @xmath1cdm cosmology , we assume a prior of @xmath48 suggested by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project @xcite .",
    "thus we have only two free parameters , i.e. , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we get the fitting results @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with the @xmath47-value per degree of freedom @xmath51 .",
    "the best - fit results suggest @xmath52 .",
    "we plot the confidence regions in the @xmath53 plane in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it seems that this constraint is quite weak and requires deeper discussions such as combinational analysis with other cosmological probes .    in order to further explore the role of the observational @xmath0 data , we study the combinational constraints from the other cosmological probes . if we combine ohd and bao , we get @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "the best - fit results correspond to a universe with @xmath57 .",
    "we also plot the confidence regions in the @xmath53 plane in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it is clear that the constraint from ohd+bao is much more restrict than using only ohd .",
    "we also find that @xmath7 is constrained more effectively than @xmath8 .    0.1 in    by combing ohd and cmb , we get @xmath58 and @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "the best - fit values correspond to a universe with @xmath61 .",
    "the fitting results are not too far from the result for combining ohd+bao , but they suggest a universe closer to being flat .",
    "we plot the confidence regions in the @xmath62 plane in fig.[fig1 ] too , and the parameters are constrained more strictly than that using ohd and ohd+bao , especially @xmath8 .",
    "and the tendency of the confidence regions keeps along with the dash - dot straight line which corresponds to a flat universe .",
    "note fig.4 in the work of su et al .",
    "@xcite for more comparisons with results from grbs .",
    "if we combine ohd , bao and cmb , we get @xmath63 and @xmath64 , with @xmath65 .",
    "this case corresponds to a universe with @xmath66 , which is a flat universe at a confidence level of 68.3% .",
    "confidence regions in the @xmath53 plane are plotted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constrained more strictly . clearly , all points within the confidence region at 99.7% confidence level are near the dash - dot straight line which stands for a flat universe .",
    "and our confidence regions are very similar to those from bao+cmb+grbs @xcite .",
    "all the fitting results discussed above are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".fitting results for a non - flat universe [ cols=\"<,^,>,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table3 ]    0.1 in",
    "the purpose of this section is to examine the role of ohd and sne ia data in the constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "thus we just consider the @xmath1cdm cosmological model with a curvature term .",
    "the likelihood for the cosmological parameters can be determined from a @xmath67 statistic .",
    "we marginalize the likelihood functions over @xmath68 by integrating the probability density @xmath69 to obtain the fitting results and the confidence regions in the @xmath70-@xmath8 plane .",
    "we further do the joint constraint using several data sets including bao and cmb . in order to avoid double - counting the constraints from cmb observation",
    ", we do not employ the prior of @xmath68 . in fig.[fig3 ] , we show the combination results of ohd+bao+cmb ( solid lines ) and sne ia+bao+cmb ( dotted lines ) respectively . for the combined constraint , we get @xmath71 , @xmath72 for ohd+bao+cmb and @xmath73 , @xmath72 for sne ia+bao+cmb respectively",
    ". the best - fit results for ohd+bao+cmb are almost identical to those for sne ia+bao+cmb combination , and are consistent with that from wmap five year s results @xcite . from fig.[fig3 ] , it is shown that there are slight differences between the confidence regions at 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% levels for ohd+bao+cmb and sne ia+bao+cmb .",
    "the one - dimensional probability distribution functions ( pdf ) @xmath74 for selections of parameters @xmath70 and @xmath8 for the combination data analysis are shown in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "it is also shown that there are only slight discrepancies between ohd+bao+cmb and sne ia+bao+cmb combination data on both pdf of @xmath70 and @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , we find that the ohd play an almost same role as sne ia for the joint constraints . in the recent work by carvalho",
    "et al.@xcite , the very similar conclusions are also drawn in the test of @xmath75 cosmology with the same data as our work .",
    "recent observations have provided many robust tools to analyze the dynamical behavior of the universe . most of them are based on distance measurements , such as sne ia .",
    "it is also important to use other different probes to set bounds on the cosmological parameters . in this paper , we have followed this direction and used the observational @xmath0 data from the differential ages of the passively evolving galaxies to constrain the @xmath1cdm cosmology , combining bao and cmb . for the non - flat case , the value of @xmath76 from ohd+bao+cmb is the smallest while that from ohd is the largest . in other words , ohd fails to provide a more restrict constraint on this model .",
    "it is mainly due to its lackness in quality and big observational errors which can be seen in fig.[fig1 ] of yi and zhang @xcite .",
    "however , most of the combinational results suggest a universe with small absolute values of @xmath9 , i.e. , close to being flat , which can be easily found in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "this is consistent with most observations that support a flat universe @xcite .    for a flat universe with a prior",
    ", the value of @xmath77 from ohd+bao is the smallest while that from ohd+cmb is the largest .",
    "if we set @xmath68 free , the value of @xmath77 from ohd+cmb is the smallest while that from ohd+bao is the largest . from fig.[fig2 ] , we can see clearly that most of the confidence regions are overlapped , in agreement with each other very well .",
    "meanwhile , most of the fitting results suggest an accelerating expanding universe at 99.7% confidence level .    from the above comparison and previous works @xcite",
    ", we find that our results from the observational @xmath0 data are believable and the observational @xmath0 data can be seen as a complementarity to other cosmological probes .",
