    "in the quest for the understanding of the ( now not so ) new evidence about the increase in the expansion rate of the universe dubbed cosmic acceleration , modifications of the structure of einsteinian gravitation have played a major ( and highly debated ) role @xcite . although it is still not clear if this unexpected behavior of the universe should or could be ascribed to new aspects of the gravitational interaction , so far a great number of modified theories of gravitation have been proposed .",
    "the most studied classes of such extensions are the ones that are often called `` extended theories of gravity '' .",
    "these theories are in some sense `` minimal '' modifications of gr and are designed to be fully metric ",
    "affine i.e. such that they are completely determined by a metric and a connection @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will focus on one type of such extensions of general relativity ( gr ) , which takes the name of @xmath0-gravity @xcite and it is characterized by an action which is non - linear in the ricci scalar .",
    "these theories emerged for the first time in quantum field theory in curved spacetime as an effect of the renormalization of the matter stress energy tensor and were successively recovered as low energy limit of fundamental theories like string theory @xcite .",
    "many aspects of the cosmology of @xmath0-gravity have been investigated with a variety of techniques , but most of the studies were focused on the homogeneous and isotropic case . even in this simple case",
    "the differences between the cosmology of relativity and the ones of these models can be quite dramatic .",
    "it is known for example that in the some simple models of this type perturbations can grow even in a state of accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "all of these extended models of relativistic gravitation are usually designed considering matter as a purely classical system , neglecting quantum properties like , for example , the spin .",
    "nonetheless the spin is an important property of the fermions , which are the most common type of fundamental constituents of standard matter .",
    "it is natural then to attempt the introduction of this feature in the mathematical structure of relativistic gravitation . in the context of gr",
    "it has been proven that one way to achieve this goal is to include an additional geometric property of spacetime : torsion @xcite .",
    "geometrically torsion is defined as a property of the spacetime that prevents infinitesimal parallelograms to be closed .",
    "this idea translates directly in the existence of an antisymmetric part of the connection and it is the cornerstone of the einstein - cartan - sciama - kibble ( ecsk ) theory . since the choice to have only a completely symmetric connection was an assumption made in the first years of gr , we can think about ecsk theory as a generalization rather than a modification of einstein gravitation .",
    "the presence of torsion beside curvature , allows both the spin and the energy of matter fields to be coupled with gravitation and opens naturally the way to the construction of an einstein - dirac theory .    the inclusion of torsion is therefore justified by the presence of the spin , which is itself justified since we know about the existence of fermions . within fermionic field equations in general , and for the dirac field in particular , the coupling spin ",
    "torsion gives rise to fermionic self - interactions @xcite . in the framework of ecsk theory , however , since the gravitational lagrangian is the usual hilbert - einstein one ( with torsion ) containing only the gravitational newton constant , the torsionally - induced effects would be manifest only at the planck scale .",
    "one can , of course , consider more general torsional completions of the hilbert - einstein action .",
    "one possibility is to introduce squared torsional contributions in the action so that the torsional terms will have their own coupling constant @xcite . in these theories",
    "torsion is present explicitly as an independent field and it has its own coupling constant which can be much larger than the newton one , giving rise to torsional effects at much larger scales .    in analogy with gr , one can also think to include semi - classical corrections in the ecsk theory so to obtain an action non linear in the scalar curvature .",
    "if we allow such an extension even more dramatic effects will emerge .",
    "in particular , the torsional contributions would acquire a coupling constant that does not only need to be fixed at scales that may be the nuclear one but it may also display a running behavior @xcite .    up to now most of the analysis of these non linear ecsk theories",
    "has been focused on homogeneous and isotropic cosmologies , but the symmetries of these spacetimes greatly limit the effect of the additional torsional contributions . for this reason it is interesting to analyze these theories in more complicated spacetimes .",
    "one could think therefore to investigate the next level of generalization : the bianchi spacetimes .",
    "bianchi spacetimes are characterized by homogeneity , but present different degrees of anisotropies .",
    "they are classified according to the symmetry groups of the spacetime in nine different classes that include , for example , the taub metric @xcite .",
    "since the anisotropies are characterized by a symmetric tensor and the torsion / spin contributions are antisymmetric by definition , it is unlikely that their interaction will be determinant in bianchi cosmologies .",
    "the one exception is constituted by the bianchi i universes in which both the anisotropies and the spin terms can be represented by scalar functions and can therefore influence each other .",
    "hence bianchi i universes offer a relatively simple testing ground for the analysis of the effect of spin in spacetimes with torsion .",
    "in this paper we will analyze the dynamics of bianchi i universes in the framework of @xmath0-gravity with torsion , in which the gravitational lagrangian is a non linear function of the scalar curvature in presence of torsion .",
    "the aim is to estimate the influence that these non linear terms have on the behavior of the cosmology and in particular on the development of the anisotropies .",
    "we will perform this analysis by means of the dynamical systems approach ( dsa ) .",
    "this approach was proposed for the first time in its final form by wainwright and ellis and had a key role in the analysis of the dynamics of bianchi universes @xcite . in the last few years",
    "this technique has been adapted to the investigation of the cosmologies of modified gravity revealing a series of interesting features @xcite . in the present paper",
    "the dsa will be combined with the _ 1 + 3 covarian approach_. this formalism was first proposed in @xcite and it has been used to analyze a wide variety of different problems including the dynamics of linear cosmological perturbations @xcite and the investigation of the features of modifications of the gravitational interaction @xcite .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will review the general @xmath0-gravity theory with torsion coupled to spin fluids . in section",
    "iii we will write the key cosmological equations in the 1 + 3 covariant approach on which the dynamical systems approach will based .",
    "section v will be dedicated to the phase space analysis of the cosmological equations .",
    "finally , section vi will be dedicated to the conclusions .",
    "unless otherwise specified , natural units ( @xmath2 ) will be used throughout this paper , latin indices run from 0 to 3 .",
    "the symbol @xmath3 represents the covariant derivative and @xmath4 corresponds to partial differentiation in the riemann - cartan space - time@xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath5 signature and the riemann tensor is defined by @xmath6 where the @xmath7 are the coefficients of the linear dynamical connection , defined by @xmath8 the ricci tensor is obtained by contracting the _ first _ and the _ third _ indices via the metric @xmath9 @xmath10 the purely metric riemann and ricci tensors will be defined with the same way using the metric connection @xmath11 and will be indicated by @xmath12 . in general all the metric quantities will be indicated with a tilda .",
    "finally , the symmetrization and the antisymmetrization over the indexes of a tensor are defined as @xmath13}= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(t_{a b}-t_{b a}\\right)\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we will rewrite the equations of the previous section using the main tool of this paper : the _ 1 + 3 covariant approach_. let us start with a brief summary of the method .",
    "such summary will not by any means be complete and we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein for more detailed information .    for any given fluid 4-velocity vector field @xmath61 , the projection tensor @xmath62 projects into the instantaneous rest - space of a comoving observer @xcite .",
    "the first covariant derivative can be decomposed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the symmetric shear tensor ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , @xmath70 is the vorticity tensor ( @xmath71}$ ] , @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 is the acceleration vector ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath75 is the volume expansion ( @xmath76 ) which defines a length scale @xmath77 along the flow lines via the standard relation @xmath78 .",
    "a general matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath22 can always be uniquely decomposed with respect to @xmath55 in the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the relativistic energy density , @xmath81 the isotropic pressure , @xmath82 the energy flux ( @xmath83 ) and @xmath84 the trace - free anisotropic pressure ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) , all relative to @xmath55 .    one can therefore derive the general propagation and constraint equations for the variables given above .",
    "these equations are called _ 1 + 3 covariant equations _ and their full set can be found in @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider bianchi i spacetimes .",
    "they are characterized by homogeneous hypersurfaces have isotropic 3-curvature @xmath88 . in addition",
    ", spatial homogeneity implies that the spatial gradients will vanish and that @xmath89 .",
    "for the same reason @xmath90 is identically zero .",
    "thus the characterizing kinematical 1 + 3 equations for this cosmological model are the raychaudhuri equation @xmath91 the shear equation @xmath92 the definition of the 3-ricci tensor @xmath93 and its trace @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    ".    for our purposes it will be useful to write and as an equation for the shear propagation and a constraint between the shear , the expansion and the matter - energy density : @xmath97 the first of the above equations can be used to write a dynamical equation for @xmath98 : @xmath99 and will be employed in place of .",
    "the conservation equations @xmath100 , can be split with respect to @xmath55 and @xmath101 : @xmath102 the set of equations , , , form a closed system and are sufficient to describe completely the evolution of bianchi i universes .",
    "let us now specialize these equations in the case of @xmath0-gravity with torsion and spin .",
    "like in the purely metric case @xcite this is done recasting the gravitational field equations in a form that resembles standard einstein gravity plus matter and an effective fluid encoding the properties of the higher order part of the gravitational interaction . for this effective fluid the effective thermodynamics",

    "because of the constraint these equations can be further simplified , but such simplification can be only obtained choosing a specific form for the function @xmath105 . in the following",
    "we will analyze the case @xmath106 .",
    "we will now consider the simplest of the possible forms of @xmath105 i.e. a general power of @xmath25 .",
    "this model is simple enough to permit simple calculations and , at the same time preserves most of the most interesting features of the more general models .",
    "it will help us to gain an insight in the effect that torsion and spin have on the properties of the cosmic evolution .",
    "if @xmath108 then using the we have @xmath109 and the ( [ eqbfr1]-[eqbfr5 ] ) can be written as @xmath110 at this point we are ready to analyze the properties of the cosmology using the _ dynamical system approach _ ( dsa ) .",
    "we will see that in spite of its original complexity @xmath107- gravity with torsion can be easily analyzed with this method and we will be able to highlight some interesting effect that torsion and spin generate in these cosmologies .",

    "looking at the structure of the above system it is clear that the phase space is symmetrical for reflection and has two invariant submanifolds .",
    "the first is forbidden by the fact that it would correspond to absence of matter and in this case the is meaningless .",
    "the second represents isotropic cosmologies .",
    "note also that for @xmath120 and @xmath121 the equations decouple .    using",
    "the one can reduce this system to a single equation . if we choose the one for @xmath122 we obtain @xmath123 this equation admits an exact solution which shows the behavior of the `` shear parameter '' with the scale factor @xmath77 @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are constant .",
    "the same can be done with the other parameter obtaining @xmath127 which admits the solution in terms of the scale factor @xmath128 it is easy to prove by direct substitution that the above solutions satisfy all of the ( [ dynsys1]-[constraint ] ) .    in spite of these results",
    "the full dynamics of the cosmology still needs to be characterized by a phase space analysis . in the present case",
    "the phase space is one dimensional and there are two fixed points which are illustrated in table [ tablepf ] .",
    "the solutions associated with the fixed point can be found integrating the equations @xmath129 which are also shown in table [ tablepf ] .",
    "we see , then , that @xmath130 represents the shear dominated era and @xmath131 represents an isotropic cosmology .",
    "looking at the stability of these two points , @xmath130 and @xmath131 can be either attractors or repellers , but they never have the same character .",

    "the presence of a static solution and the fact that this solution is unstable is a sign that a bouncing solution is possible in this type of cosmology .",
    "a bounce in general relativity is characterized by the condition @xmath154 holding at the bounce instant @xmath155 . however in non standard gravity , since the scale factor does not evolve monotonically this definition is not so clearcut @xcite .",
    "in fact one can only characterize if the scale factor presents a minimum , but this is not in general sufficient to realize the classical bounce scenario , which also require @xmath156 . in what follows",
    "we will focus only on the conditions i.e. the necessary conditions for a bounce , leaving a more detailed analysis for a dedicated future work .    from our phase space analysis",
    "it is clear that the theory presents a bouncing behaviour realized when the matter variable is chosen with the plus sign i.e. @xmath157 and describes a cosmology that , starting form an isotropic collapsing state bounces approaching an isotropic expansion state .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in a counterintuitive way , the matter density decreases during the collapsing phase , so that in the bounce it is lower than the starting value .",
    "this feature is probably due to the complex interaction between higher order terms and matter . instead , when @xmath158 we have bounce connecting two shear dominated solutions",
    "i.e. a cosmology that , starting form an anisotropic collapsing state approaches to an anisotropic expansion state . in this case",
    "the matter energy density grows with the collapse , and the switch between expansion and contraction happens for a value of energy density higher than the initial one .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the bianchi i cosmology of @xmath0-gravity with torsion using the dynamical systems approach .",
    "compared with the standard @xmath0-gravity , theories with torsion contain the additional constraint that simplifies considerably the phase space analysis . in the case of @xmath159",
    "gives an analytical result . with this choice of @xmath105",
    ", we examined both the cases in which the cosmological fluid does not posses spin and the one in which the spin is present .    in the first case the phase space is unidimensional and contains two fixed points which can be attractors or repellers .",
    "in particular , for @xmath150 and @xmath160 , the anisotropy dominated fixed point is unstable and the matter dominated one is an attractor .",
    "this means that the cosmology tends to isotropize .",
    "this result is similar to the one found in @xcite in which the case of a bianchi i cosmology without torsion was analyzed . in that case , however , the limits on the values of the parameter @xmath114 were different , but the conclusions drawn there are valid also in this case : @xmath0-gravity with torsion can also , provided that other observational constraints ( such as the spectrum of gravitational waves ) are satisfied , constitute an alternative to inflation .",
    "indeed an isotropization effect due to torsion is already a feature of the standard eksc theories of gravity , but it usually requires a contracting phase and a bounce @xcite . in this respect",
    "the higher order corrections permit to eliminate the need for a bouncing behavior .",
    "the dynamical systems equations can be also solved exactly giving a useful relation between the matter and shear densities which could be used to perform , for example , the classical cosmological tests for this class of theories .    in the case of a cosmic fluid with spin",
    "the dimension of phase space grows accordingly .",
    "the spin terms , however , do not enter directly in the raychaudhuri equations and therefore there is no `` spin dominated '' fixed point .",
    "for this reason the introduction of the spin does not modify much the geometry of the orbits and , for example , the conditions on the fixed point stability for the presence of an isotropic attractor do not change .",
    "however in this case the set of initial conditions for which this scenario is realized is smaller .",
    "specifically , the isotropization of cosmic histories can only be realized if the initial conditions are chosen in so that @xmath161 , which in terms of the standard cosmological parameters means @xmath162    the cosmologies we have analyzed also include the necessary conditions for the occurrence of a bounce .",
    "the classical version of the bounce i.e. a phase of isotropic collapse followed by one of isotropic expansion is found to be possible only if @xmath153 and the initial conditions associated with this specific behaviour are given by the inequality @xmath163 which , in terms of the standard cosmological quantities gives @xmath164 the bouncing is also characterized by a decrease of the matter variable @xmath152 . since this variable is a monotonic function of the energy density it turns out that during the contraction phase the matter density actually decreases , which might appear counterintuitive . however one must bear in mind that there is an `` effective fluid '' in the model : the one represented by the higher order corrections .",
    "therefore such behavior is most likely due to the combination of the presence of the spin and these additional terms .",
    "in addition , the phase space analysis also shows a more exotic form of bounce , which links a contracting and an expanding shear dominated solutions .",
    "this behavior is realized for any initial condition provided that @xmath165 and the matter energy density has the expected behavior i.e. grows in the contraction phase .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze in detail this new typology of bounce and , for example , understand if the anisotropy is able to `` transmit '' information between the contraction and expansion phase .",
    "on more general terms , our analysis confirms , consistently with the results obtained in @xcite , that while torsion can influence in a non trivial way the behavior of @xmath0 cosmologies , the spin has a secondary role .",
    "the most likely explanation for this difference lays in the symmetries of the spacetime and the spin tensor , which prevent a direct coupling of the two quantities .",
    "if this line of reasoning is correct one can expect that the spin will have a key role in cosmologies in which the vorticity is non negligible , like godel s universes , or , more interestingly , in the analysis of the gravitational collapse in which it is natural to expect an growing value of the vorticity .",
    "the exploration of these last cases will be an interesting further development of the present work .",

    "<S> while torsion is able to modify the cosmological dynamics with respect to the purely metric case , the spin has little influence on the cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this is due to the different symmetries of the tensor characterizing the anisotropies and the spin tensor . </S>",
