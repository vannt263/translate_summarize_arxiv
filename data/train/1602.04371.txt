    "<S> this study examines the magnetotransport response observed in flakes of the @xmath0d topological insulator bi@xmath1te@xmath2 , including indium superconducting electrodes , and demonstrates two critical transitions in the magnetoresistive response with decreasing temperatures below @xmath3 k. the first transition is attributed to superconductivity in the indium electrodes , and the second transition , with a critical field exceeding the transition field of indium , is attributed to a proximity effect at the 2d planar interface of this hybrid ti / superconductor structure .    </S>",
    "<S> topological insulators ( ti ) are 2- and 3-dimensional electronic materials that behave as a normal insulator in the bulk but conduct electricity in edge or surface states , respectively , that arise from a bulk - boundary correspondence , and are topologically protected by time - reversal symmetry.@xcite ti are characterized by a strong spin - orbit coupling that provides a locking between spin and linear momentum , and the helical spin polarization as gapless surface states exhibit a linear dispersion relation , i.e. , `` dirac cones , '' characteristic of relativistic massless particles . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 quantum well system was the first theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally demonstrated@xcite 2d ti , followed by the prediction@xcite and experimental confirmation@xcite of the technological significant @xmath5 quantum well system as another 2d ti . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 was the first theoretically predicted- and experimentally identified-3d ti.@xcite since then , a large number of other systems with a band - gap @xmath7 at @xmath8 k including @xmath9,@xcite @xmath10,@xcite and @xmath11,@xcite have joined the class of 3d ti . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , among these systems , @xmath9 has exhibited superconductivity with a critical transition temperature of @xmath12 k , when copper is intercalated between the adjacent quintuple layers.@xcite further , the application of pressure in the range of 3 - 6 gpa in @xmath11 has been shown to induce superconductivity with @xmath13 k and @xmath14k@xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> t.@xcite    the proximity effect from an ordinary s - wave superconductor in the ti leads to exotic @xmath16 superconductivity capable of hosting majorana fermions , and this prediction has heightened interest in experimental studies of superconductor - topological insulator hybrid devices.@xcite thus , many have examined ti nanowire - superconductor devices in search of majorana modes at the ends of one dimensional devices.@xcite nevertheless , a two - dimensional experimental setting for the study of majorana modes is desirable . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , superconductivity is induced in the surface state of the ti by the proximity effect produced by an ordinary s - wave superconductor , and the majorana mode is a vortex bound state at the interface of the two materials . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been interest in whether  in systems now called `` topological metals , '' which include 3d ti materials such as @xmath11 and @xmath9 that have bulk states coexisting with surface states at the fermi energy  </S>",
    "<S> it is possible for the proximity effect to extend from the superconductor covered surfaces to uncovered surfaces of the 3d ti@xcite and whether the uncovered surfaces of the 3d ti can thus host majorana modes.@xcite in moving towards exploring such possibilities , we have examined the magnetotransport response in the @xmath0d topological insulator @xmath11 in the presence of ( indium ) topside superconducting electrodes.@xcite remarkably , the experimental results showed two critical transitions in the magnetoresistive response below @xmath17 k. while the first transition is associated with a shunting effect by the contacts , the second anomalous contribution , which indicates @xmath18 k and @xmath19k@xmath20 t , is attributed here to a generalized proximity effect in the ti .    </S>",

    "<S> superconductor / topological insulator junctions were realized by directly pressing indium onto the surface of the @xmath11 flake in a hall bar configuration ; see supplementary material for the images of the samples.@xcite here , indium is a s - wave superconductor with the critical temperature @xmath24 k.@xcite electrical measurements were carried out using the standard four - terminal low - frequency lock - in techniques , and all the reported resistances are four - terminal resistances . </S>",

    "<S> ac _ was applied along the long axis of the hall bar , through electrodes at the two ends , and the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the hall bar surface , as usual . </S>",
    "<S> since the flakes are not so thin , the applied current is carried by both the specimen bulk and the specimen surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> further , since the proximity effect should be restricted to the near surface regions , one expects to observe just resistance corrections due to the proximity effect in the measured four terminal resistances . </S>",
    "<S> that is , one does not expect the four terminal resistance to vanish even with the onset of superrconductivity in the contacts and the proximity effect in the surfaces near the contacts . </S>",
