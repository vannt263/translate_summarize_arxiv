    "the absence of diffusion in disordered media ( the so - called _ anderson localization _",
    "@xcite ) is an important effect that arises in transport phenomena , such as electromagnetic , acoustic and spin waves , in different types of classical or quantum linear systems .",
    "it is more interesting , however , to study what happens to the disordered system if nonlinearity is introduced .",
    "understanding the effect of nonlinearity on the localization properties of wavepackets in disordered systems has attracted the attention of many researchers to date @xcite .",
    "most of these works consider the evolution of an initially localized wavepacket in a chain of particles modeled by a continuous dynamical system and show that it spreads subdiffusively in moderately nonlinear systems , while for strong enough nonlinearities a substantial part of the wavepacket remains self - trapped .",
    "in particular , for single - site excitations , the spreading of the wavepacket leads to an increase of the second moment @xmath6 in time of the form @xmath7 , both in the diffusive and self - trapping regimes @xcite .",
    "currently , a greatly debatable question concerns the long time behavior of wavepacket spreading in disordered nonlinear particle lattices .",
    "recently , it was conjectured @xcite that chaotically spreading wavepackets will asymptotically approach kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) torus - like structures in phase - space , while in all numerical simulations chaotic spreading shows no sign of slowing down @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for particular disordered nonlinear models , some numerical indications of a possible slowing down of spreading have been reported @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , employing ideas from nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite , we studied the same problem and found no such sign of quasi - periodic kam behavior and all our evidence appears to strengthen the conjecture that waves spread subdiffusively and chaotically for arbitrarily long times in nonlinear disordered media .",
    "it would be interesting , therefore , if similar results could also be found in coupled nonlinear maps modeling nonlinear disordered media as they are computationally easier to study than the systems of ordinary differential equations of their hamiltonian counterparts .",
    "hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps , and in general discrete time systems , can be identified through discretization techniques , i.e. poincar sections .",
    "the drawback of this approach however is that the resulting map is in general , not explicitly given and thus one has to resort to the construction of a suitable discrete system that is able to exhibit similar dynamical and statistical properties as the disordered hamiltonian counterpart .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use tools of nonextensive statistical mechanics to investigate the connection between regimes of `` weak '' and `` strong '' chaos and diffusion in a system of @xmath8 coupled symplectic mcmillan maps ( cmm ) @xcite , with the purpose of linking them to analogous results obtained recently for a klein - gordon ( kg ) hamiltonian system in the presence of disorder and nonlinearity @xcite . in this framework , we are interested to explore the question whether coupled symplectic maps can be used to study subdiffusive spreading of wavepackets in disordered media , instead of using continuous flow dynamical models such as the kg hamiltonian .    as is well - known , probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems have been studied by many authors , aiming to understand the transition from deterministic to stochastic dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental questions concerns the existence of an appropriate invariant probability density or ergodic measure , characterizing chaotic motion in phase - space .",
    "if it is possible to demonstrate the existence of such a measure , one can postulate that the system is at thermal equilibrium and can therefore be studied from the point of view of classical statistical mechanics .    since the existence of an invariant measure is not known _ a priori _ , one can still proceed in the context of the central limit theorem @xcite and consider the variables of a chaotic solution at discrete times @xmath9 as realizations of @xmath10 independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables @xmath11 . if the motion is uniformly ergodic in some region of phase - space , one finds that the pdfs of the _ sums _ of these variables converge rapidly to a gaussian distribution , whose mean and variance are those of the @xmath12 s . in such cases",
    "we call the dynamics `` strongly '' chaotic , since at least one lyapunov exponent is positive @xcite and the respective subset of the constant energy manifold is uniformly covered by chaotic orbits , for all but a ( lebesgue ) measure zero set of initial conditions .    now ,",
    "if the system has not yet reached thermal equilibrium , it may happen that its orbits `` stick '' for long times on the boundaries of islands surrounding stable periodic orbits , where lyapunov exponents @xcite become very small and may even vanish @xcite .",
    "in such regimes , the motion may be called `` weakly '' chaotic , as trajectories get trapped within complicated sets of cantori and diffuse through multiply connected domains of phase - space in a highly nonuniform way @xcite .",
    "many such examples have been discovered in physically realistic systems studied recently @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we compare the diffusive dynamics of a system of coupled symplectic mcmillan maps @xcite , with analogous results obtained recently in ref .",
    "@xcite for a kg hamiltonian 1-dimensional lattice in the presence of disorder and nonlinearity .",
    "in particular , we find in both models that weakly chaotic dynamics is associated with subdiffusive motion and is characterized by pdfs of sums of variables that _ do not _ rapidly converge to a gaussian , but are well approximated for long times by the so - called @xmath5-gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath13^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] where the @xmath5 entropic index satisfies @xmath14 , @xmath15 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath16 is a normalization constant .",
    "eventually , of course , it is expected that chaotic orbits will wander within larger chaotic seas , where the dynamics is more strongly ergodic .",
    "when this occurs , the @xmath5 entropic index of eq .",
    "( [ q_gaussian ] ) decreases towards @xmath17 , which represents the limit at which the pdf becomes a gaussian distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ distributions_n100_2_different_etas ] for an illustrative example ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied wavepacket spreading in a hamiltonian system represented by a disordered nonlinear kg chain of @xmath18 particles @xcite and found that even though there are phase - space regions of weak chaos , strongly chaotic dynamics eventually prevails characterized by @xmath5-gaussian pdfs that approach a gaussian pdf for long times .",
    "we have thus concluded that the motion will never approach a kam regime of invariant tori as suggested by some authors @xcite .",
    "in analogy with these findings , the statistics of diffusive motion in chains of @xmath8 cmm maps yield similar results to those for the kg system , although there are substantial differences in the dynamics of the two systems .",
    "in particular , in the kg system the dynamics is such that each particle has an elliptic point at the origin , while in our study for the cmm maps each map has a saddle point at the origin .",
    "moreover , the kg system has a conserved quantity ( see eq . ) , while there is no such known quantity for the studied cmm maps of eqs . .",
    "another difference is that the kg system is characterized by diffusive processes of one epoch @xcite whereas in our study we find diffusion described by two different epochs . finally , in the kg system large nonlinearities result in selftrapping , while smaller nonlinearities are connected to subdiffusion .",
    "in contrast , in the cmm maps large coupling strengths lead to diffusion while smaller values show no spreading . despite these differences",
    ", we do find evidence of subdiffusion accompanied by weak and strong chaos , as in the case of the disordered kg chain , when the maps have a saddle point at their origin and the coupling strength is high enough . in that sense",
    "our results demonstrate that coupled symplectic maps can be used to model diffusive motion .",

    "we wish to explore diffusion in regimes of weak chaos , where lyapunov exponents are positive but very small .",
    "such situations often arise when solutions move slowly through thin chaotic layers , wandering through a complicated network of higher order resonances , often sticking for very long times to the boundaries of islands constituting the so - called `` edge of chaos '' regime @xcite .",

    "( [ tsallis entropy ] ) under appropriate constraints .",
    "systems characterized by the tsallis entropy are said to lie at the `` edge of chaos '' and are significantly different from boltzmann - gibbs systems , in the sense that their entropy is nonadditive and generally nonextensive @xcite .",
    "in fact , a @xmath5-central limit theorem has been proved @xcite for @xmath5-gaussian distributions ( [ q_gaussian ] ) that is of the same form as the classical central limit theorem .    as we demonstrate in the following sections , in regions of weak chaos these distributions are well - fitted by a @xmath5-gaussian pdf for fairly long time intervals , whose @xmath5 value is distinctly greater than 1 .",
    "it may happen , of course , for longer times that the orbits begin to diffuse through domains of strong chaos , in which case @xmath5 tends to 1 and the well - known form of a gaussian pdf is eventually recovered .    to study diffusive processes of chaotic dynamics in multi - dimensional cmms",

    "moreover , integrating the equations of motion for times as long as @xmath68 and computing the corresponding pdfs , we found evidence that the dynamics does _ not _ relax onto a quasi - periodic kam torus , as it has been conjectured @xcite , but continues to spread chaotically along the chain for arbitrarily long times .",
    "typically , hamiltonian systems and in general discrete time dynamical systems can be analyzed with the help of discretization techniques , such as poincar sections .",
    "the disadvantage is that the resulting map is , in general , not explicitly known and thus one has to resort to the construction of a suitable discrete system that exhibits similar statistical properties with its disordered hamiltonian counterpart . moreover , since the numerical integration of hamilton s equations for long particle chains is often too costly , one might wonder whether it is possible to use a system of symplectic maps to model the dynamics and statistics of multi - degree of freedom hamiltonian systems , especially in the physically interesting case where nonlinearity and disorder coexist @xcite .",
    "this would mean that each particle in such a chain corresponds to a 2-degree of freedom oscillator and is modeled by a 2-dimensional symplectic map .",

    "thus , cmms represent a discrete non - linear system of @xmath8 2-dimensional symplectic mcmillan maps with a quadratic nearest neighbor interactions potential of the form @xmath82 under fixed boundary conditions @xmath83 , while @xmath84 is the coupling parameter that renders the system non - integrable .    in the uncoupled case ( i.e. @xmath85 ) , if @xmath86 each map has a saddle point at its origin , while for @xmath87 the origin is elliptic .",
    "choosing @xmath88 larger than 1 , if @xmath89 is small enough , we make sure that the coupling does not alter the stability properties of the origin , while the dimensionality of its stable and unstable manifolds can still be adjusted by only varying the values of the @xmath88 parameters . for these reasons",
    ", we have chosen to use throughout the paper @xmath88 values in @xmath90 $ ] to emulate disorder as we have additionally checked by numerical simulations that any other choice of @xmath91 produces similar results .",
    "finally , a preliminary study for different initial conditions ( i.e. initial excitation strengths ) revealed that as long as they are chosen sufficiently close to the origins of all maps , the obtained results are similar .",
    "this is supported by the fact that for @xmath91 all origins are saddle points with stable and unstable manifolds and thus a typical initial excitation strength of the @xmath81-th map @xmath92 suffices to ensure that the above properties hold .",
    "now , if one starts with all maps having stable origins ( all @xmath93 ) and excites only the central map , just as we did in ref .",
    "@xcite for single - site excitations of the kg system , no chaotic diffusion is observed .",
    "we , therefore , turn to the more challenging scenario where the central map has a saddle point at its origin and use an ensemble of @xmath43 initial conditions near that point , assuming that all other maps have elliptic points at their origin .",
    "finally , we increase the number of maps with saddle point origins and study the dynamics and diffusion of orbits in phase - space by computing the corresponding pdfs of sums of their position coordinates @xmath94 as described in sec .",
    "[ clt_approach ] to understand if there is any connection between chaotic diffusion in the two models .",
    "we first considered @xmath95 coupled mcmillan maps and studied the dynamics around the origin when the central map ( i.e. @xmath96 ) is unstable . in the calculations of the pdfs , we used as an observable variable @xmath97 of the central map and averaged over @xmath98 initial conditions randomly chosen within @xmath99 $ ] about a reference orbit started close to the origin . for @xmath100 as small as 0.001 we observed no diffusion since the corresponding @xmath101 exponent was practically 0 and the pdfs of the sum variable @xmath102 of the central particle were well approximated by @xmath5-gaussians , whose index fluctuates around @xmath103 even after as many as @xmath104 iterations !    on the other hand , increasing the coupling strength to @xmath105 allows for the presence of stronger chaos and yields signs of diffusive behavior . in fig .",
    "[ fig_subsection_results_2013_01_06 ] , we show for the @xmath95 case ( with @xmath64 ) , in each row , from left to right , the two largest lyapunov exponents @xmath106 , @xmath107 ( left panels ) , the msd as a function of the number of iterations @xmath19 ( central panels ) and the @xmath108 entropic index of the central map ( i.e. @xmath109 ) as a function of @xmath19 ( right panels ) .",
    "note that , as the number of unstable maps increases , @xmath108 approaches 1 with increasing @xmath19 and a diffusion process is observed whose exponents @xmath101 for large enough @xmath19 are clearly smaller than 1 .",
    "in particular , when more than two maps are unstable , there is first a transient state of rapid diffusion with msd @xmath110 and @xmath111 , faster than ballistic , over a relatively small number of iterations .",
    "then , as @xmath19 increases , a second epoch occurs with @xmath45 , corresponding to subdiffusive dynamical processes .",
    "the next step is to set @xmath112 and increase the coupling further setting @xmath113 with single site excitations perturbing only the central map , and all @xmath88 values chosen randomly in the interval @xmath90 $ ] to emulate disorder as in the kg system . in this case , we obtain much more interesting statistics . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ distributions_n100_2_different_etas ] , strong chaos is displayed when all maps are taken into account ( panel b ) ) with @xmath114 ( that corresponds to @xmath115 ) , while the 15 central maps of the chain exhibit weak chaos ( panel a ) ) with @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 ) .",
    "these findings are important as they demonstrate a similar situation to the physical problem of disordered kg coupled oscillators studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the central particles perform weakly chaotic motion , while the overall system displays strongly chaotic dynamics depicted by their corresponding entropic indices .    based on these first results ,",
    "our next step was to investigate cmms of increasing @xmath100 to relate complex statistics with diffusive dynamics .",
    "we did that for 30 , 50 and 100 disordered cmms using single site excitations .",
    "in all cases studied , we witnessed the same scenario : in order to observe ( sub)diffusion in the disordered cmm , the coupling strength had to be relatively large ( @xmath118 ) with all maps being locally unstable at the origin with all @xmath88 randomly distributed in @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "we thus concluded that , for small enough coupling , orbits do not diffuse in phase - space but rather remain wandering around the unstable origins of each cmm .",
    "this behavior was clearly depicted by the entropic indices as the central particle performed a weakly chaotic motion with @xmath108 values substantially higher than unity whereas the rest of the chain behaved in an essentially strongly chaotic manner approaching @xmath119 in the long run .",
    "we then turned to bigger values of @xmath100 , focusing on 30 and 50 cmms as the case of 100 cmm performed similarly .",
    "in particular , for 50 cmms and @xmath105 , exciting only the central map and taking all maps to have a saddle point at their origin , we found that after an initial number of about @xmath120 iterations ( during which the orbits diffuse very fast with msd @xmath121 ) , the chain settles down to a clearly subdiffusive regime with msd @xmath122 as evidenced in the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_subsection_results_2013_06_30_n=50_allkin1.2_1.6_0.1 ] .",

    ", the subdiffusive motion is characterized by an exponent @xmath128 and by all entropic indices fluctuating in the interval @xmath129 $ ] , signaling that the dynamics of the chain is close to fully developed chaos .",
    "these findings provide evidence that the cmm system in the long run , for sufficiently high dimensionality and coupling strength , sup does show evidence of strong chaos and subdiffusion , and thus exhibits dynamics quite similar to what was observed in the kg continuous flow model studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigated the connection between regimes of `` weak '' and `` strong '' chaos and diffusive dynamics in a multi - dimensional system of coupled symplectic mcmillan maps , with the aim of comparing our results with analogous studies by s. flach and coworkers on a klein - gordon hamiltonian in the presence of disorder and nonlinearity .",
    "our main idea was to explore whether coupled symplectic maps can be used to study wavepacket subdiffusive spreading in disordered media , thus avoiding the tedious integration of large systems of ordinary differential equations that describe hamiltonian particle chains such as the kg model .",
    "our statistical approach was based on the computation of sums of position coordinates , in the spirit of the central limit theorem and nonextensive statistical mechanics , approximating the probability distribution functions by @xmath5-gaussians , whose index @xmath0 is connected with weak chaos , and @xmath17 with strong chaos .",
    "let us summarize our findings in reference to the questions we raised in sec .",
    "[ clt_approach ] : first , we demonstrated that our cmm analogue of a disordered nonlinear system of hamiltonian oscillators displays chaotic diffusion connected with two main epochs : a relatively short one of super - diffusion followed by a second subdiffusive stage with exponents quite smaller than 1 .",
    "this is in contrast to diffusive motion in a disordered kg chain where only one epoch is observed @xcite .",
    "secondly , we studied cmms with increasingly higher dimensionality to explore the relation between complex statistics and subdiffusion and verified in all cases that to observe subdiffusive motion the coupling strength has to be moderately large and independent of dimensionality . thus , in comparison with our findings for the kg system in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics and statistics of diffusive motion in the cmm model yield analogous results .    finally , we showed that subdiffusion is accompanied by weak and strong chaos ( with @xmath0 and @xmath17-gaussian pdfs respectively ) regardless of the dimensionality of the system , but depending on the coupling strength , in analogy to a disordered kg chain at different energy ranges .",
    "the key point behind this remark is that in the kg system nonlinearity is measured by the amplitude of the initial excitation that determines the total energy and diffusive / statistical properties of the dynamics , whereas in the coupled map model chaotic diffusion is measured by the magnitude of the coupling strength which is proportional to how much the cmms deviate from the integrable @xmath85 limit ( see eq . ) .",
    "finally , in the coupled map model disorder does not seem to play an equally important role as in the kg system .",
    "thus , even though there are substantial differences in the local dynamics of the two systems considered here , our results suggest that coupled symplectic maps may be used to model subdiffusion and weakly chaotic behavior in certain classes of multi - dimensional nonlinear oscillators .",
    "for such systems , employing discrete iterative systems can circumvent costly numerical algorithms needed to integrate the corresponding continuous time equations of motion and identify maps through complicated discretization techniques .",
