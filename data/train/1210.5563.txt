    "metal oxides demonstrate a variety of physical and chemical properties , sometimes in intriguing combinations .",
    "apart from being ubiquitous in nature , metal - oxide surfaces and interfaces find diverse technological applications and are being explored for potential use in future electronic devices . in particular , surfaces of magnetoelectric antiferromagnets such as  possess an equilibrium surface magnetization , @xcite making them suitable for use as active layers in electrically - switchable magnetic nanostructures .",
    "@xcite    the  ( 0001 ) surface has been a subject of many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies , but its surface remains poorly understood .",
    "low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) experiments for a thin  ( 0001 ) film grown on a cr ( 110 ) single crystal revealed an unusual reentrant structural phase transition,@xcite in which the surface structure changes from @xmath5 to @xmath6 and back to @xmath5 under cooling from room temperature to 150 k and then further down to 100 k. the origin of these phase transitions is not understood .",
    "while the high - temperature transition may , as suggested by the leed data , @xcite be a conventional order - disorder transition , the second one is unusual in that a more symmetric phase appears at lower temperatures .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that , as shown by takano _",
    "@xcite , both phase transitions disappear for thicker  films grown in a similar way .",
    "this suggests that the epitaxial strain has an important effect on the surface energetics .",
    "oxidation of the cr @xmath7 surface was investigated by leed and auger spectroscopy , @xcite and it was found that under growth conditions similar to those of ref .",
    "the thin  ( 0001 ) film is subject to a tensile epitaxial strain of about 1.5% .    in this paper",
    "we study the structure of the  ( 0001 ) surface using first - principles electronic structure calculations and monte carlo simulations .",
    "our results suggest that the dynamics of the system is driven by the occupation of two competing surface cr sites .",
    "the system can be mapped to an ising model on a two - dimensional hexagonal lattice in external field .",
    "the first phase transition is clearly identified as a conventional ordering transition , and the theoretical transition temperature is found to be in good agreement with experiment .",
    "our calculations further reveal a strong effect of tensile epitaxial strain , which parametrically drives the system towards configurational frustration , particularly in combination with antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "an explanation of the second phase transition is offered based on these results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ method ]",
    "we describe the computational methods .",
    "section [ surf - struc ] presents the results on the configurational and magnetic energetics of the  ( 0001 ) surface , including the identification of the competing surface cr sites , the construction of the configurational hamiltonian , the analysis of magnetic interactions , and the evaluation of the ground - state phase diagram .",
    "section [ thermo ] deals with configurational thermodynamics of the surface , and section [ sec - exper ] discusses the relation of the results to experiments . the electronic structure of the  ( 0001 ) surface is presented in section [ el - str ] , and its magnetic properties in section [ surf - mag ] .",
    "section [ summary ] draws the conclusions .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed using the projector - augmented wave method @xcite implemented in the vasp code . @xcite for the cr @xmath8 shell we employed the rotationally - invariant lsda@xmath9 method @xcite with @xmath10 ev and @xmath11 ev .",
    "this method was preferred over gga@xmath9 adopted in ref .   due to its better description of the structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of bulk .@xcite different surface superstructures",
    "were modeled using supercells representing symmetric slabs with eight atomic layers of o and 16 atomic layers of cr stacked along the ( 0001 ) direction .",
    "the periodically repeating slab is separated from its image by 1.5 nm of vacuum .",
    "we considered @xmath5 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath6 surface supercells ( where @xmath5 corresponds to the hexagonal unit cell of bulk ) .",
    "the lateral dimensions of the unstrained supercell were fixed to the calculated equilibrium bulk values;@xcite for the strained case these values were used as a reference .",
    "apart from these constraints , the ionic positions were relaxed until the hellmann - feynman forces were converged to less than @xmath14 ev@xmath15 .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff was fixed to @xmath16 ev and the brillouin zone integration was performed using @xmath17-centered monkhorst - pack grids .",
    "@xcite for relaxation we used gaussian smearing of @xmath18 ev and a @xmath19-point mesh equivalent to or denser than @xmath20 for the @xmath5 surface supercell .",
    "we checked the convergence with respect to the number of @xmath19-points , the energy cutoff for the plane wave expansion , the size of the vacuum region , and the thickness of the slab .",
    "these tests indicate that the total energies are generally converged to within 1 mev .",
    "density of states ( dos ) calculations were performed using gaussian smearing of @xmath21 ev and a @xmath19-point mesh equivalent to or denser than @xmath22 for the @xmath5 supercell .",
    "the energy barriers for the thermally - activated jumping of cr ions between the two competing surface sites were calculated using the nudged elastic band method . @xcite",
    "seven images were inserted between the two energy minima , and in each image the ions were relaxed so that forces perpendicular to the reaction path were smaller than 0.05 ev /  .",
    "crystalizes in the corundum structure with the @xmath23 space group .",
    "it can be viewed as a stacking of buckled honeycomb cr double layers along the ( 0001 ) direction with quasi - hexagonal closed - packed o layers in between , see fig.[slab ] .",
    "the ( 0001 ) surface is polar , and simple electrostatic arguments suggest that non - stoichiometric terminations by an o layer or by a cr double layer should lead to divergent electrostatic potential in the bulk . on the other hand",
    ", the surface can terminate in the middle of the buckled cr layer so that only half of the cr ions from this layer remain on the surface .",
    "although still polar , this termination is stoichiometric , and the electrostatic potential in the bulk is not divergent . it can therefore be expected that this termination is energetically favorable . indeed , surface termination by a single cr layer was consistent with leed @xcite and scanning tunneling microscope @xcite measurements of the  ( 0001 ) surface in ultrahigh vacuum .",
    "further , first principles calculations by rohrbach _",
    "@xcite based on the gga@xmath9 method have shown that this termination has the lowest surface energy ( compared to all others considered ) over the entire range of oxygen chemical potential where  is stable .",
    "note that earlier results based on the gga method , which leads to grossly incorrect electronic and magnetic properties,@xcite were quite different.@xcite in this work we only consider the  ( 0001 ) surface terminated by a single layer of cr .",
    "the location of the cr ions within the single cr terminating layer has been debated . within the double cr layer",
    "there are three possible octahedral sites , two of them being occupied in the bulk .",
    "they give rise to three nonequivalent surface sites ( a , c and d , see fig .",
    "[ slab ] ) that surface cr ions can occupy .",
    "occupation of site a corresponds to the continuation of the bulk structure .",
    "further , as pointed out by gloege _ et .",
    "al . _ , @xcite the surface cr ion can jump below the oxygen subsurface layer and occupy the empty octahedral site within the underlying cr double layer . this interstitial site is directly underneath the surface site a , and we denote it by b ( see fig .  [ slab ] ) .",
    "surface terminations .",
    "gray and red spheres represent cr and o atoms , respectively.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to identify the energetically preferable sites , we therefore considered four @xmath5 surface models corresponding to the exclusive occupation of sites a , b , c , or d , respectively . in all cases a significant inward relaxation",
    "was observed , as expected for a nominally polar surface .",
    "the relaxation data for models a and b are included in appendix [ app - a ] .",
    "we define the surface energy as @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the ground state energy of the slab for the given surface model with magnetic structure corresponding to bulk , @xmath26 is the ground state energy per unit cell of bulk , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the numbers of atoms in the slab and in the bulk unit cell , and @xmath29 is the number of surface cr atoms on one side of the slab .",
    "the surface energies for the four @xmath5 surface terminations are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the surface energy is the lowest when site a is occupied .",
    "occupation of sites c and d leads to much higher surface energies , and we therefore do not consider their occupation in the subsequent analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the surface energy of model b is only slightly higher than that of model a. thus , sites a and b can both be partially occupied , which can lead to non - trivial ordered terminations and phase transitions ; these issues are addressed in the following subsections .",

    "however , the relative importance of the three - body term compared to the two - body term is @xmath42 . since for the considered surface models @xmath33 varies between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the relative importance of the three - body term is substantial and reaches 50% . in the diagrammatic cluster - expansion language",

    "the shaded areas in fig .  [ temppd ] denote regions where the ground - state structure was not included in mfa .",
    "typically these structures have complicated orderings and should undergo first - order transitions to simpler orderings like a@xmath1b@xmath0 or ab at fairly low temperatures .",
