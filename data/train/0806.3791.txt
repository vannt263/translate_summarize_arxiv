    "a detailed description and justification of the scan strategy we used can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we summarise the processing of the aztec / goods - n data , which is specifically geared towards finding mm _ point _ sources . the data reduction procedure generally follows the method outlined in @xcite , although we emphasise several new pieces of analysis that were facilitated by the improved depth of this map over the cosmos survey .",
    "we begin with the cleaning and calibration of the time - stream data in   [ ana_cleaning ] , which includes a new investigation into the sample length over which to clean the data . in   [ ana_map_filter ] , we describe the map making process and the optimal filtering for point sources .",
    "we asses the properties and quality of the aztec / goods - n map in   [ ana_map_qual ] .",
    "the depth of this survey has enabled us to ascertain the degree to which our data follow gaussian statistics and detect , directly , a departure from it at long integration times indicating a component of signal variance due to source confusion .",
    "the astrometry of the map is analysed in   [ ana_stacking ] , and we describe the extraction of sources from the optimally filtered map in   [ ana_sources ] .      the aztec data for each raster - scan observation consists of pointing , housekeeping ( internal thermometry , etc . ) , and",
    "bolometer time - stream signals . because the bolometer data are sampled at 64  hz , all other signals are interpolated to that frequency as needed by the analysis .",
    "the raw time - streams of the 107 working bolometers are first despiked and low - pass filtered at 16hz , as described in @xcite .",
    "the despiked and filtered time - streams are next `` cleaned '' using a principal component analysis ( pca ) approach , which primarily removes the strong atmospheric signal from the data .",
    "this `` pca - cleaning '' method was developed by the bolocam group @xcite and later adapted for aztec , as described in @xcite . as explained there , we also generate pca - cleaned time streams corresponding to a simulated point source near the field centre , in order to produce the _ point - source kernel _ , which is used later for beam - smoothing our maps ( see   [ ana_map_filter ] ) .    in this work",
    "we go beyond the analysis in @xcite to verify that we have made good choices with regard to several aspects of the general cleaning procedure that has been adopted for all of the existing aztec data .",
    "we examine two outstanding questions in particular : 1 ) does pca - cleaning work better than a simple common - mode subtraction based only on the average signal measured by all detectors as a function of time ? and 2 ) over what time scale should each eigenvector projection be calculated in order to give the best results ?",
    "the first question addresses whether simple physical models may be used in place of pca - cleaning , where the choice of which modes to remove from the data is not physically motivated . we investigate this by creating a simple sky - signal template as the average of all of the detectors at each time sample .",
    "we then fit for an amplitude coefficient of the template to each detector by minimising the r.m.s . between the scaled template and the actual data .",
    "this scaled template is removed from the bolometer data and we examine the residual signal , which ideally consists only of astronomical signal and white noise . we find that this residual signal contains many smaller detector - detector correlations that are clearly visible in the data and are dominant compared to the signal produced by astronomical sources in the map . the residual time - stream r.m.s .  from the simple sky - template subtraction",
    "is usually about twice the r.m.s .  resulting from pca cleaning .",
    "this test shows that the simple common - mode removal technique is insufficient .    in the `` standard '' pca - cleaning procedure for aztec data , outlined in @xcite ,",
    "the eigenvector decomposition is performed on each scan ( @xmath2215  s of data ) .",
    "we now study which time scales give the best results using a statistical correlation analysis .",
    "we generate a bolometer - bolometer pearson correlation matrix using sample lengths that range from a fraction of a second to tens of minutes ( the length of a complete observation ) . on the shortest time scales ,",
    "the correlation coefficients have large uncertainties due to sample variance ( too few samples from which to make estimates ) . on time scales corresponding to a single raster - scan ( @xmath3515  sec )",
    ", however , the sample variance decreases and a clear pattern emerges : the strength of the correlations drops off uniformly with physical separation between the detectors .",
    "the most obvious trend is the gradient in correlations that we see with detector elevation , which is presumed to be produced by the underlying gradient in sky emission .",
    "as the sample length increases , a different pattern emerges , in which the dominant correlation appears to be related to the order in which the detectors are sampled by the read - out electronics , rather than their physical separation .",
    "these correlations , likely due to electronics - related @xmath23 drifts , are effectively removed when using scan - sized sample lengths ( 515s ) as well , since they appear as dc baseline differences on these short time - scales .",
    "these results verify that scan - sized sample lengths produce the best results as they provide a sufficient number of samples on short enough time scales .",
    "after pca - cleaning the bolometer signals , we apply a calibration factor to convert the bolometers voltage time - streams into units of jy per beam .",
    "details of this procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "the total error on the calibrated signals ( including the error on the absolute flux of uranus ) is 11% .",
    "the map - making process used to generate the final optimally filtered aztec / goods - n map is identical to that used in @xcite , and the reader is directed to that paper for the details of this process , which we briefly summarise below .",
    "we first generate maps for each of the 50 individual raster - scan observations separately by binning the time - stream data onto a 3  @xmath17  3  grid in ra - dec which is tangent to the celestial sphere at ( 12@xmath2437@xmath2500@xmath26 , + 62@xmath211300 ) .",
    "we chose the same tangent point and pixel size as that used for the scuba map of goods - n ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) so that the two maps can easily be compared in a future paper .",
    "we find that this pixel size provides a good compromise between reducing computation time , while sampling with high resolution the 18-arcsec fwhm beams .",
    "individual signal maps and their corresponding weight maps for each observation are created as described in @xcite , along with kernel maps that reflect how a faint point source is affected by pca - cleaning and other steps in the analysis .",
    "next , we form a single `` co - added '' signal map from the weighted average over all 50 individual observations .",
    "an averaged kernel map is also created in a similar way .",
    "the total weight map is calculated by summing the weights from individual observations , pixel by pixel .",
    "as described by @xcite we also generate 100 noise realization maps corresponding to the co - added map .",
    "we then use a spatial filter to beam - smooth our map using the point - source kernel , by optimally weighting each spatial - frequency component of this convolution according to the spatial power spectral density ( psd ) of noise - realization maps . details of this optimal filter",
    "can also be found in @xcite .",

    "we identify this region by imposing a coverage cut .",
    "we find that weights within 70% of the central value occur in a contiguous region of 245arcmin@xmath0 .",
    "the map of fig .",
    "[ fig_source_map ] has been trimmed to only show this region .",

    "the negative ring around the centre and other peripheral features ( not visible here ) are induced by pca - cleaning as well as the optimal filter.,width=220 ]    we also run the co - added kernel map through the same filtering process as the signal map . the resulting filtered kernel map , whose profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_kernel ] , is our best approximation of the shape of a point source in the co - added , filtered signal map . as demonstrated in ",
    "[ ana_stacking ] , our pointing jitter / uncertainty has a sub-2-arcsec characteristic scale ; this will have little impact on the kernel shape and therefore is not included in generating the kernel map .",
    "the negative troughs around the central peak are due to a combination of array common - mode removal in the pca - cleaning and de - weighting of longer spatial wavelength modes by the optimal filter .",
    "the point - source kernel also has radial scan - oriented features , or `` spokes , '' due to pca cleaning that are @xmath280.1% of the kernel amplitude .",
    "the directions of these spokes would vary across the map as the scan angle changes with ra - dec .",
    "therefore , the kernel map accurately reflects these spokes only for point sources near the centre of the field .",
    "however , because it is difficult to analytically model a point source ( through pca cleaning and optimal filtering ) and because the radial features are very faint , we use the kernel map as a point source - template for injection of sources in the simulations described later .    because this goods - n survey is the deepest blank - field survey conducted thus far with aztec on the jcmt",
    ", we demonstrate in fig .",
    "[ fig_quietness_plot ] how the map noise averages down with the successive co - addition of individual observations .",
    "the central 200@xmath17200  region of the signal map and the noise realisation maps are used for this calculation .",
    "the x - axis represents the average weight of a 3-arcsec pixel in this region prior to filtering .",
    "a scale factor converts this raw weight to an effective time , @xmath29 , so that the final effective time equals the final integration time devoted to an _ average _ 3-arcsec pixel in this central patch .",
    "thus , the increment in @xmath29 gained with the addition of an individual observation is the effective integration time contributed by that particular observation to the central region .",
    "the @xmath30th y - axis value is calculated by co - adding ( averaging ) individual signal maps from observations 1 through @xmath30 , then applying the optimal filter , and finally taking the standard deviation of this co - added , filtered map in the central region .",
    "the crosses represent the signal map .",
    "the 100 curves shown in a lighter shade are calculated by carrying out the same process on 100 noise realisations . in the absence of systematics or astronomical signal",
    ", we expect all curves to scale as @xmath31 , in accordance with gaussian statistics , as indicated by the dashed line . at higher @xmath29",
    ", we may expect a slight steepening in all curves because later co - additions better reflect our assumptions of circular symmetry ( in the optimal filtering process ) as we add more scan directions to the mix .",
    "however , this effect appears to be unmeasurably small in our data .",
    "while the noise realisations follow the @xmath31 trend , the signal map initially follows it but flattens near the point where @xmath3230  s of effective time is spent on a 3-arcsec pixel . switching the order in which",
    "signal maps are co - added does not alter this trend or the noisy behaviour of these points at large @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that : 1 ) single individual observations yield maps that are consistent with our noise realisations ; 2 ) map features that do not survive scan - by - scan `` jack - knifing , '' presumably astronomical signal due to source confusion , prevent the signal map s r.m.s . from improving as @xmath31 ; and 3 ) the fact that noise realisations continue to follow this trend indicates that we are far from a systematics floor due to atmospheric or instrumental effects , even at the highest @xmath29 .",
    "the pipeline used to produce this map of goods - n interpolates pointing offsets inferred from regular observations of pointing calibrators interspersed with science targets @xcite . in order to verify the quality of this pointing model for goods - n ,",
    "both in an absolute sense , and in terms of small variations between passes , we compare the aztec map with the extremely deep 1.4ghz vla data in this field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* morrison et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the radio data reduction and source list used here is the same as that of @xcite , with a 1-@xmath27 noise of @xmath35.3@xmath33jy at the phase centre .",
    "the catalogue is constructed with a 4-@xmath27 cut , and has positional uncertainties @xmath34 ( morrison et al . in prep . ) .",
    "we stack the signal in the aztec map at the positions of radio sources to check for gross astrometric shifts in the aztec pointing model , as well as any broadening in the stacked signal which may indicate significant random offsets in the pointing between visits .",
    "a more detailed comparison between the mm and 1.4ghz map is presented in ( chapin et al . in prep . ) to assist with the mir / nir identifications of individual aztec smgs , and the production of radio  nir seds .",
    "the stack was made from the 453 1.4ghz source positions that are within the uniform noise region of the aztec map .",
    "as in @xcite we check for an astrometric shift and broadening by fitting a simple model to the stacked image , which consists of an astrometric shift ( @xmath35ra , @xmath35dec ) to the ideal point source kernel , convolved with a symmetric gaussian with standard deviation @xmath36 .",
    "this gaussian represents our model for the random pointing error in the aztec map .",
    "we determine maximum likelihood estimates @xmath35ra @xmath37 , @xmath35dec @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the expected positional uncertainty ( in each coordinate ) for a point source with a purely gaussian beam is approximately @xmath40fwhm/(s / n ) ( see the appendix in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where the fwhm is 18arcsec in our case .",
    "the s / n of our stack is approximately 10 , so the expected positional uncertainty is @xmath41 .",
    "therefore the total astrometric shift measured by the fitting process , @xmath42 , is consistent with the hypothesis that there is _ no _ significant underlying shift .",
    "we also note that the @xmath43 function for this fit is extremely shallow along the @xmath36 axis , so although the minimum occurs at @xmath44 , it is not significantly more likely than @xmath45 .",
    "we therefore conclude from this analysis that there is no significant offset , nor beam broadening caused by errors in the pointing model .          to investigate the presence of astronomical sources in our map , we plot in fig .",

    "the noise histogram can be modelled well by a gaussian centred on @xmath46mjy with a standard deviation of 1.0mjy .",
    "the obvious excess of large positive pixel values and the small excess of negative values in the signal map are caused by the presence of sources .    to identify individual point sources",

    "our analysis of these source candidates is simplified because no pair of them are close enough to significantly alter each other s recovered flux densities ( @xmath4836arcsec apart in each case ) .",
    "we have evidence that azgn01 is a blend of two sources .",
    "however , since this knowledge is not based on aztec data alone , we defer a detailed discussion of that source for the second paper of this series ( chapin et al . in prep . ) .    the final signal map and these source candidates are shown in fig .  [ fig_source_map ] .",

    "the dust emissivity spectral index may also be estimated by averaging the 1.1 mm to 850  flux density ratio of individual sources or by performing the appropriate stacking analysis . due to the moderate s / n of sources in our surveys , the effects of flux bias and survey completeness",
    "must be accounted for in such analyses .",
    "therefore , performing a combined fit to the differential number counts vs.  de - boosted flux from the two surveys , where those effects are already included , is an appropriate method for estimating the spectral index . from fig .",
    "[ fig_int_counts ] , the hypothesis that scuba and aztec detect the same underlying source population appears plausible .    however , we do not comment on the formal goodness of fit as the @xmath43 obtained for the combined fit is unreasonably small because the full degree of correlation between data points is underestimated in the standard computation of the two covariance matrices @xcite .",
    "in addition , the best - fit parameters of the combined fit may have a large scatter from a global mean value ( if one exists ) , due to sample variance , as the two surveys cover different fields .",
    "although scuba 850  number - counts are available for goods - n @xcite , the survey region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_goodsn_cover ] ) and the method used to estimate number counts in that work are quite different from those used here .",
    "therefore , we chose to fit to the scuba / shades number counts @xcite instead , since they were determined using methods similar to ours .",
    "we have used the aztec instrument on the jcmt to image the goods - n field at 1.1  mm .",
    "the map has nearly uniform noise of 0.961.16@xmath51 across a field of @xmath52 .",
    "a stacking analysis of the map flux at known radio source locations shows that any systematic pointing error for the map is smaller than 1arcsec in both ra and dec .",
    "thus , the dominant astrometric errors for the 36 source - candidates with s / n@xmath533.5 are due to noise in the centroid determination for each source . using a s / n@xmath533.75 threshold for source robustness , we identify a subset of 28 source candidates among which we only expect 12 noise - induced spurious detections .",
    "furthermore , of the 11 aztec sources that fall within the considered region of the scuba/850- , 8 are detected unambiguously .",
    "this aztec map of goods - n represents one of the largest , deepest mm - wavelength surveys taken to date and provides new constraints on the number counts at the faint end ( down to @xmath54 ) of the 1.1  mm galaxy population .",
    "we compare two very different techniques to estimate the number density of sources as a function of their intrinsic flux  a frequentist technique based on the flux histogram of detected sources in the map similar in spirit to that of @xcite , and a bayesian approach similar to that of @xcite .",
    "reassuringly , the two techniques give similar estimates for the number counts .",
    "those results are in good agreement with the number counts estimates of @xcite but differ significantly from those of @xcite .",

    "if we assume that the two instruments are detecting the same population of sources , we obtain a grey body emissivity index of @xmath56 for the dust in the sources .",
    "while there is no evidence based on the number counts that 1.1  mm surveys select a significantly different population than 850  surveys , we caution that the number counts alone can not really test this hypothesis",
