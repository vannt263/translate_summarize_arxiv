    "given the long and distinguished record the carnegie observatories have in the exploration of galaxies and determining their distances from us , it is perhaps fitting that this centennial celebration coincides with the emergence of the new generation of large galaxy redshift surveys that are now mapping the galaxy distribution over statistically representative ( @xmath0mpc@xmath1 ) volumes of the local universe . the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) , carried out on the 3.9 m anglo - australia telescope at siding spring observatory , australia , is one such survey .",
    "unlike the sloan digital sky survey ( nichol 2003 ) , the 2dfgrs has already been completed , with its final observations taken on 11 april 2002 . at that point",
    "it had obtained spectra for 270,000 objects , providing redshifts for 221,496 unique galaxies in the range @xmath2 , with a median of @xmath3 .",
    "the survey provides an almost complete sampling of the galaxy distribution down to an extinction - corrected limit of @xmath4 mag over @xmath5square degrees of sky .",
    "this sky coverage is contained within two declination strips covering @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the ngp and sgp regions , respectively , plus 99 `` random '' 2-degree fields in the sgp .",
    "the contiguous coverage of the sky within the two strips , together with the almost complete ( @xmath8% ) sampling of the galaxy distribution , has produced the highest fidelity three - dimensional ( 3d ) maps ever seen of the galaxy distribution and its large - scale structure .",
    "this is clearly revealed in the cone diagram shown in figure 1.1 , where the full range of structures ( knots , filaments , voids ) are resolved in fine and delicate detail .",
    "one of the most conspicuous features of the galaxy distribution seen in figure 1.1 is the _ clustering _ of galaxies , and the abundance of dense , `` knotty '' structures in which rich clusters are embedded .",
    "it is the quantification of this clustering and the rich wealth of data on clusters ( and their environs ) that the 2dfgrs has provided that is the focus of this paper .",
    "firstly , we briefly review the key findings to come from the precision measurements of galaxy clustering afforded by 2dfgrs , many of which have become the `` flagship '' results of the survey .",
    "we then describe the work that we have been doing on _ known _ rich clusters within the survey , using them as sites to study the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) and galactic star formation in the densest environments , and hence via contrast with these same properties measured in lower - density regions within the survey , to draw conclusions as to their environmental dependence .",
    "finally , we briefly mention work in progress on using the survey itself to generate a new 3d - selected catalog of galaxy groups and clusters using automated and objective group - finding algorithms .          in quantifying and characterizing the clustering seen in the 3d galaxy distribution",
    ", 2dfgrs has realized significant advances , not just in the precision of the measurements , but also in extending them to much larger scales .",
    "the key to the latter is the much larger volumes that are ( sparsely ) probed by the random fields ( cf .",
    "the strips on their own ) , allowing structure to be measured on scales up to @xmath9mpc .    the clustering over these scales has been measured statistically using both two - point correlation function and power spectrum analyses .",
    "being based on redshift information , these functions are , of course , derived in terms of the redshift - space rather than the real - space positions of galaxies . nonetheless ,",
    "when used jointly and in combination with the matter power spectrum provided by cosmic microwave background measurements , they have yielded a number of new fundamental results on the origin of large - scale structure , the matter content and density of the universe , and galaxy biasing ; these can be summarized as follows ( for further details , see the specific references quoted and also colless 2003 ) :    1 .",
    "unambiguous detection of coherent collapse on large scales  manifested by a flattening of the 2d correlation function in the line - of - sight direction at scales of 2040@xmath10mpc  confirming structures grow via gravitational instability ( peacock et al . 2001 ) .",
    "2 .   the detection in the power spectrum of `` acoustic '' oscillations due to baryon - photon coupling in the early universe . derivation from these oscillations of the baryon fraction : @xmath11 ( percival et al . 2001 ) .",
    "3 .   measurement of @xmath12 from both the power spectrum and the redshift - space distortions seen in the 2d correlation function : @xmath13 .",
    "4 .   through comparison of the 2dfgrs power spectrum and the cosmic microwave background power spectrum , the first measurement of the galaxy bias parameter @xmath14 ( lahav et al . 2002 ; see also verde et al .",
    "2002 ) and its variation with galaxy luminosity ( @xmath15 ; norberg et al . 2001 ) and type ( madgwick et al . 2003 ) .",
    "placement of a stronger limit on the neutrino fraction , @xmath16 , implying a limit on the mass of all neutrino species of @xmath17ev ( elgary et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the 2dfgrs includes an abundance of rich clusters , with 947 known clusters from the abell ( abell 1958 ; abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) , apm ( dalton et al . 1997 ) and edcc ( lumsden et al . 1992 ) catalogs identified and further characterized by de  propris et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at a time when the survey was just half complete . of these ,",
    "60 have since been used for a detailed study of the cluster lf ( de  propris et al .",
    "2003 ) . here",
    "the selection was restricted to clusters with @xmath18 in order to sample well below the predicted @xmath19 .",
    "a further criterion was that clusters must contain at least 40 confirmed members within the abell radius ( @xmath20mpc ) .",
    "cluster membership had been determined previously in the de  propris et al .",
    "( 2002 ) study using a `` gapping '' algorithm to isolate cluster galaxies in redshift space .",
    "the clusters were also chosen to ensure a range in velocity dispersion ( and hence mass ) , richness , bautz - morgan ( b - m ) type , and structural morphology .",
    "this sample was used to produce a series of `` composite '' lfs , with clusters and their member galaxies being combined to allow meaningful and statistically robust comparisons based on both global cluster properties and galaxy type . as a starting point ,",
    "a composite lf was derived for the entire cluster sample containing 4186 members ; this is shown in figure 1.2 . as can be seen",
    ", it provides a very high - quality `` overall '' cluster lf covering 7.5magnitudes in luminosity ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is well fit by a schechter ( 1976 ) function with a characteristic magnitude of @xmath22 and a faint - end slope of @xmath23 ( right - hand panel of fig .",
    "1.2 ) .",
    "a series of composite lfs based on global cluster properties were also constructed , with the cluster sample divided into subsamples according to high ( @xmath24kms@xmath25)/low ( @xmath26kms@xmath25 ) velocity dispersion , rich / poor , `` early '' b - m ( types i , i  ii , ii)/``late ''",
    "b - m ( types ii ",
    "iii , iii ) , and with substructure / without substructure ( see de  propris et al .",
    "2003 for further details ) .",
    "surprisingly , no statistically significant lf variation was seen between these different subsamples !",
    "the only conspicuous difference seen was between composite lfs formed for the inner ( core ) and outer regions of clusters , with the former having many more very bright galaxies than the latter .",
    "comparison of these composite cluster lfs , in particular the `` overall '' function shown in figure 1.2 , with their 2dfgrs field counterparts is readily available from the work of madgwick et al .",
    "a schechter function fit to their composite field lf over the same absolute magnitude range yields parameter values of @xmath27 mag and @xmath28 . hence , taken at face value",
    ", it would appear that the cluster lf is 0.3mag _ brighter _ in @xmath29 and has a steeper faint - end slope ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , clusters contain a very different morphological mix of galaxies compared to the low - density field ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) , and before this difference in the lfs between the two can be interpreted as evidence for an environmental dependence , underlying lf - galaxy type effects ( which have already been seen in the field ; folkes et al . 1999 ; madgwick et al .",
    "2002 ) need to be first investigated .",
    "this has been done on the basis of galaxy spectral type , paralleling the approach taken by madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the field . here",
    ", a galaxy s spectrum is typed on the basis of the relative strength of its first two principal components ( from a principal component analysis analysis ; folkes et al .",
    "1999 ) , which represent the emission and absorption components within the spectrum .",
    "this is parameterized in terms of the quantity @xmath31 , which is the linear combination of these two components : @xmath32 .",
    "as might be expected , clusters and the field have quite a different mix of galaxies in terms of @xmath31 , as can be seen in the upper panel of figure 1.3 . in line with the morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) and the relationship between @xmath31 and morphology ( t type ) that is seen in the bottom panel of figure 1.3 , clusters are dominated by galaxies with the lowest @xmath31 values ( absorption - line dominated , no emission ) , whereas the field contains a much larger proportion of galaxies with higher ( @xmath33 ) values , indicative of line emission in what are most likely late - type spirals . for the purposes of deriving lfs for different spectral types , madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) divided the @xmath31 scale into 4 intervals , with type 1 galaxies being those in the range @xmath34 , type 2 galaxies @xmath35 , type 3 galaxies @xmath36 , and type 4 galaxies @xmath37 .",
    "using these same definitions , de  propris et al .",
    "( 2003 ) derived composite lfs for the type 1 , type 2 , and types 3 + 4 galaxies within their clusters ; these are plotted in the left - hand panel of figure 1.4 .",
    "here we see the same general trends that are seen in the field ( madgwick et al .",
    "2002 ) in that earlier spectral types have lfs with brighter characteristic magnitudes and flatter faint - end slopes .",
    "this can be seen quantitatively in the right - hand panel of figure 1.4 . however , careful comparison of these lfs with their field counterparts ( fig .",
    "1.5 ) reveals some subtle , but significant , differences , at a level of detail only a large survey like 2dfgrs can discern .",
    "these differences are encapsulated in figure 1.6 , which shows the location in the @xmath38 plane of the type 1 , type 2 , and type 3 + 4 lfs both for clusters and the field , as well as the `` overall '' lfs based on all types .",
    "clearly the biggest difference between cluster and field is for the early types , with the cluster type 1 lf having a brighter @xmath29 ( by @xmath39mag ) and a steeper faint - end slope ( @xmath40 ) compared to the field .",
    "in contrast , the cluster and field lfs for the latest types ( types 3 and 4 ) are , to within the errors , indistinguishable .",
    "the type - dependent differences in the schechter lf parameters that are seen between clusters and the field in figure 1.6 also put the comparison of the `` overall '' lfs into perspective . although there is a significant difference between the two , it is small in comparison to the differences seen between the early types ( types 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this , together with the quite different mix of spectral types in clusters and in the field , would indicate that the similarity in the overall lfs is more by accident than design , with these mix and spectral type effects conspiring to produce lfs in the two different environments with characteristic magnitudes and faint - end slopes that are quite similar .    in order to understand these type - dependent lf differences between clusters and the field in the context of cluster galaxy and environment - dependent evolution , an initial attempt has been made to model them using a simple `` closed box '' approach ( de  propris et al .",
    "this involves making the following basic assumptions : ( 1)cluster galaxies have evolved from field galaxies contained within the volume that collapses to become the cluster , ( 2)this evolution is characterized by a suppression of star formation activity and an accompanying change in spectral type , and ( 3)the number of galaxies is conserved ( i.e. , mergers are neglected ) . under these assumptions ,",
    "the type - specific field lfs are taken to be the initial lfs within the cluster volume , with the relative normalizations set by the mix of different types that are observed .",
    "this very simple model has some success in that it reproduces the similar shape but different normalization that is observed for the type 3 + 4 lfs in clusters and in the field .",
    "moreover , it does cause the initial field lfs of the type 1 and 2 galaxies to evolve toward the forms they are observed to have in clusters . however , at a more detailed level , it fails in producing too many bright type 2 cluster galaxies , too few very bright type 1 cluster galaxies , and too few faint type 1 cluster galaxies .",
    "obvious refinements to this model ( on which we are currently working ) are to allow for luminosity - dependent fading to steepen the faint - end slopes of the earlier types , and to include mergers to explain the excess of very bright early types at the expense of their fainter counterparts .",
    "the galaxy spectra obtained by the 2dfgrs are of sufficient quality not only to determine redshifts but also to measure spectral - line indices and derive astrophysical information about the galaxies themselves",
    ". moreover , the spectra extend to sufficiently red wavelengths ( @xmath41  ) to include the redshifted h@xmath42 emission ( or absorption ) line , thus providing a reliable means of measuring the overall star formation rate ( sfr ) within galaxies ( kennicutt 1992 ) . in this section",
    "we describe how this has been used to track star formation activity as a function of environment , firstly from a cluster - centric point of view , and secondly in galaxy groups .      to date",
    ", the global sfr among galaxy populations has generally concentrated on the two extremes of galaxy environment : the low - density field and the dense cores of rich clusters .",
    "for the latter , attention has been very much drawn by the discovery of butcher & oemler ( 1978 ) that such systems harbored many more star - forming galaxies in the past .",
    "but galaxies in cluster cores comprise ony a small fraction of the stellar content of the universe and may be subject to environmental effects that are peculiar to these very high - density environments ( e.g. , ram pressure stripping , galaxy `` harassment , '' and tidal interactions ; dressler 2003 ) .",
    "much more pertinent to the evolution of the general galaxy population is the environment _ between _ cluster cores and the field , spanning 3 orders of magnitude in galaxy density and which remains largely unchartered in terms of tracking star formation .        as a first step toward redressing this situation , we have analyzed 17 @xmath43 clusters from the de  propris et al .",
    "( 2002 ) study , using them to trace the global galactic sfr continuously from their centers out to arbitrarily large radii .",
    "these clusters were chosen so that roughly half ( 10 ) had `` high '' velocity dispersions ( @xmath44kms@xmath25 ) and the other half had `` low '' velocity dispersions ( @xmath45kms@xmath25 ) .",
    "all the 2dfgrs galaxies within a projected distance of 20mpc from the centers of these clusters and within the range @xmath46 were selected for analysis .",
    "the restriction in redshift was to limit the effects of aperture bias and poor sky subtraction .",
    "a luminosity cutoff of @xmath47 mag was then applied to the sample , this being the limit to which 2dfgrs is complete over the adopted redshift range .",
    "finally , all galaxies for which there were continuum / line fitting problems at h@xmath42 or whose ew([n  ii ] @xmath486583)/ew(h@xmath42 ) ratios showed evidence of a nonstellar component ( values @xmath490.55 ) were excluded from the analysis .",
    "this resulted in a final sample of 11,006 galaxies .",
    "the equivalent width of the h@xmath42 line ( be it in absorption or emission ) was measured using an automated gaussian profile fitting algorithm , which simultaneously fitted and deblended the h@xmath42 line from the neighboring [ n  ii ] @xmath486548   and [ n  ii ] @xmath486583   lines . since only equivalent width rather than",
    "line flux measurements are possible with the 2dfgrs spectra , we can only infer the sfr , @xmath50 , per unit luminosity : @xmath51ew(h@xmath42 ) , using kennicutt s ( 1992 ) sfr - ew(h@xmath42 ) relation .",
    "we then normalized this to a characteristic luminosity @xmath52 : @xmath53ew(h@xmath42 ) , where @xmath52 is taken to be the knee in the luminosity function in the @xmath54 band ( near rest - frame h@xmath42 ) , as determined by blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    in figure 1.7 ,",
    "the mean and median value of @xmath55 is plotted as a function of the projected cluster - centric radius . here",
    "the latter has been normalized by the cluster virial radius , @xmath56 , which has been calculated for each individual cluster and ranges from 1.4 to 2.4mpc . also plotted in the top panel of figure 1.7 is the fraction of galaxies with @xmath57yr@xmath25 , which represents the tail of the distribution , comprised of galaxies that are currently forming stars at a high rate relative to their luminosities .",
    "the solid horizontal line represents the values derived for the `` field '' galaxies within our sample , that is , galaxies that lie within the 20mpc selection radius , but which , from their redshifts , are identified as non - members .",
    "the bracketing dashed horizontal lines represent the 1 @xmath58 standard deviation from field to field , giving some estimate of the cosmological variance in the field value .",
    "irrespective of which statistic is used , it is very clear that within the clusters @xmath55 falls significantly below the value of the field , the difference being at a maximum at the cluster center and then monotonically decreasing with increasing cluster - centric radius .",
    "_ importantly , convergence does not occur until @xmath59 ! _ hence , compared to the field , cluster galaxies differ in their mean star formation properties as far out as @xmath60mpc from their centers . also of note",
    "is that these radial trends in @xmath55 appear to be insensitive to cluster mass , with there being no discernible difference between the `` high''- and `` low''-velocity dispersion clusters .",
    "such a radial analysis , however , is likely to be sub - optimal , since many of the clusters in our sample are clearly not spherically symmetric and show substructure .",
    "we have therefore analyzed @xmath55 as a function of the local projected galaxy density , @xmath61 , based on the distance to the tenth nearest neighbor ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath55 and @xmath61 is shown in figure 1.8 , using the same three statistics that we used in the radial analysis .",
    "the vertical line shows the mean value of @xmath61 within @xmath56 , and once again the horizontal lines show @xmath55 and its 1 @xmath58 variance for the field .",
    "we see that cluster galaxy star formation is suppressed relative to the field , the difference being greatest at the highest local densities , and decreasing monotonically with decreasing density until the two converge at @xmath62galaxympc@xmath63 , a factor of @xmath64 times lower than the mean projected density of the cluster virialized region .",
    "yet again the trend is no different in the `` high''- and `` low''-velocity dispersion clusters , indicating that sfrs depend only on the local density , regardless of the large - scale structure in which they are embedded .",
    "further evidence that local density is the key variant is also provided by a plot based on just those galaxies with @xmath65 , where the same trend observed for the full sample is seen .",
    "this would suggest that a more general view of star formation suppression be taken : that it will be low relative to the global average in _ any _ region where the local density exceeds a value of @xmath66galmpc@xmath63 ( @xmath67 mag ) .",
    "it is well known that galaxy morphology is very strongly correlated with local galaxy density ( dressler 1980 ) , and hence consideration needs to be given to what underlying contribution this has to the @xmath68 relationship seen in figure 1.8 . using a simple model based on dressler s morphology - density relation , we have calculated the expected variation in @xmath55 ; this is represented by the _ solid curves _ in figure 1.8 .",
    "this appears to be shallower than the observed relation , suggesting that the morphology - density relation is distinct from the sfr - density relation , with additional processes operating at @xmath69 galaxympc@xmath63 that drive @xmath55 significantly below that expected on the basis of the changing morphological mix .",
    "indeed , it may well be the case that the suppression of star formation is the primary transformation that occurs with environment , with the change in morphological mix being a secondary effect ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ; shioya et al .",
    "2002 )            extension of this analysis to the galaxy group environment has just recently become possible through the 2dfgrs being subjected to a 3d `` friends - of - friends '' analysis to identify groups ( and clusters ) in both position and redshift space ( eke et al .",
    "this has produced a catalog containing @xmath70 groups with at least 2 members ; their distribution within the two 2dfgrs strips is shown in figure 1.9 .",
    "the star formation properties of this sample are currently being analyzed , and we show here ( courtesy of dr .",
    "m. balogh ) a couple of very preliminary results that give the first indications of environmental trends in these much poorer , lower - velocity dispersion analogs to rich clusters .",
    "once again the h@xmath42 line has been used as a measure of sfr , with it being identified and its equivalent width measured in the spectra of all group members in identical fashion to that described above for cluster galaxies .",
    "an overall h@xmath42 equivalent width was then derived for each group taking the mean value of all its members . in figure 1.10",
    "this mean value is plotted as a function of group velocity dispersion , being represented by all the individual dots . to assess whether there is any overall trend ,",
    "the data have been divided into equally populated velocity dispersion bins and averaged ; the continuous line has been drawn through these average values . as a comparison , the mean h@xmath42 equivalent width for `` field '' galaxies  those galaxies identified as not belonging to any group within the friends - of - friends analysis",
    " is shown as the horizontal dashed line .",
    "it can be seen in figure 1.10 that there is a noisy but significant trend of h@xmath42 emission ( and hence sfr ) becoming increasingly stronger with lower group velocity dispersion . intriguingly , however , this trend intersects the horizontal `` field '' line at @xmath71kms@xmath25 , indicating that there are not only groups whose mean ew(h@xmath42 ) is below that of the field ( as might be expected from the sfr@xmath61 relation observed in the rich cluster study ) , but also groups whose mean ew(h@xmath42 ) is _ higher _ than the field , hinting that star formation activity is for some reason enhanced ( cf .",
    "the field ) in these lower - velocity dispersion ( @xmath72kms@xmath25 ) groups .    the underlying reason for this may well be contained in figure 1.11 , where we show the mean ew(h@xmath42 ) for just the _ binary _ groups within the @xmath72kms@xmath25 regime , plotted as a function of their separation ( in mpc ) .",
    "yet again , the equal - numbered bin averaging and the benchmark `` field '' value are represented in the same way as in figure 1.10 .",
    "we see that for separations in the range 0.110@xmath10mpc , binary groups have , to within the fluctuations , the same mean ew(h@xmath42 ) as the field .",
    "however , at separations below 0.1@xmath10mpc , the mean ew(h@xmath42 ) for binary groups is seen to be significantly higher than the field .",
    "although this is yet to be fully investigated , it is suggestive that the enhanced sfrs seen in the low - velocity dispersion groups ( relative to the field ) can be attributed to `` close '' binary systems where tidal interactions may well be responsible for this activity .    .",
