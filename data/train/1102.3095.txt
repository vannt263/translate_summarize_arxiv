    "we can show the black holes finally vanish by the analytical method and by the dynamical horizon equations . as we proved paper at 2006 in @xcite ,",
    "the black holes finally vanish , by solving the dynamical horizon equations , and present paper mainly based on the paper .",
    "note that the dynamical horizon equations and the einstein equations are same , and to solve dynamical horizon equations is same as to solve field equation .",
    "however , in the previous paper , we use the approximations that we use the negative energy @xcite near the event horizon not for the dynamical horizons .",
    "so in this paper we do not use the approximations .",
    "our paper explain the result of previous paper and we show black hole evaporation problem without any approximations .",
    "the black hole evaporation problem starts from s.w.hawking @xcite at 1975 . by his study",
    "we could find the black holes emit lights as the thermal radiation .",
    "and we can think that the black holes may be vanished by this effect i.e. hawking effect .",
    "however , the proof of this problem seems to be hard , because we should solve field equations , and the field equations are forth order partial differential equations with non - linear term .",
    "we can not find the mathematical methods to solve such equations .",
    "however , by the study of the dynamical horizons @xcite@xcite , we can solve this problem .",
    "we can explain shortly the previous works of the black hole evaporation .",
    "the orthodox work may be page s result @xcite as @xmath0 , it comes from the dimensional analysis .",
    "the string approach is @xcite@xcite@xcite , or semiclassical theory typically using apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "hiscok studied spherical model of the black hole evaporation using the vaidya metric , which we also use in present work , to solve the black hole evaporation problem .",
    "however , he simply set a model not taking account of the field equation .",
    "work@xcite treated the black hole mass more generally than our present case .",
    "however , he did not use the field equation either .",
    "one of the more recent studies is sorkin and piran s work @xcite on charged black holes . and neutral case has been done by hamade and stewart@xcite .",
    "their conclusion is that black hole mass decreases or increases depending on initial condition .",
    "they used a model of the double null coordinates , and obtained a numerical result .",
    "but they did not consider the hawking effect directly but they used massless scalar field as a matter .",
    "brevik and halnes calculated primordial black hole evaporation@xcite .",
    "very recently hayward studied black hole evaporation and formation using the vaidya metric @xcite .",
    "it seems no analytical equation has been proposed for the black hole mass with the hawking effect taken into account .    in a section [ sec2 ]",
    "we explain our previous result @xcite by short sentences . and in a section [ sec3 ] , we explain the calculations of the dynamical horizons equation without any approximations . finally in a section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we discuss and conclude our results .",
    "we can show our previous result in three subsections . in the subsection [ sec2 - 1 ]",
    ", we explain the dynamical horizons equation . in the subsection [ sec2 - 2 ] ,",
    "we explain the vaidya spacetime . and in the subsection [ sec2 - 3 ]",
    ", we show our previous result by calculating the dynamical horizons equation .",
    "the subsection [ 2 - 2 ] and [ sec2 - 3 ] is the review of the previous paper and mainly same as [ sa ] .",
    "the reason why we use the dynamical horizons equation is it only needs information of the horizon surface , and reason why we use the vaidya spacetime is that the dynamics of the horizon is free by the fluent matter .",
    "the study of the dynamical horizon is mainly depend on ashtekar and krishnan s works @xcite@xcite , and we omit the main calculations to derive the dynamical horizons equation . the definition of the dynamical horizons are as follows .",
    "+   + _ definition_. a smooth , three - dimensional , spacelike submanifold @xmath1 in a space - time is said to be a _ dynamical horizon _ if it is foliated by preferred family of 2-spheres such that , on each leaf s , the expansion @xmath2 of a null normal @xmath3 vanishes and the expansion @xmath4 of the other null normal @xmath5 is strictly negative .",
    "+   + this definition is similar to the apparent horizons . for simplicity ,",
    "the definition of the black hole is that the black hole does not emit even light .",
    "although the above definition was given by ashtekar and krishnan , the definition define only spacelike horizons .",
    "so we can modify the above definition , as follows",
    ". +   + _ definition ( modified version)_. a smooth , three - dimensional , spacelike or * timelike * submanifold @xmath1 in a space - time is said to be a _ dynamical horizon _ if it is foliated by preferred family of 2-spheres such that , on each leaf s , the expansion @xmath2 of a null normal @xmath3 vanishes and the expansion @xmath4 of the other null normal @xmath5 is strictly negative .",
    "+   + the timelike dynamical horizon is also called timelike membranes .",
    "there is the dynamical horizons equation . from the einstein equation on the dynamical horizons",
    ", we can use 3 + 1 decomposition and then 2 + 1 decomposition , and finally using the gauss - bonet theorem , we obtain @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the radios of the dynamical horizons before the energy flows in the horizons and @xmath8 is the radius of the dynamical horizons after the energy flows in the horizons .",
    "and @xmath9 is the gravitational constant , and integration is on the dynamical horizon @xmath10 , and @xmath11 means stress - energy tensor with cosmological constant , and the @xmath12 is the normal timelike vector diagonal to horizons and @xmath13 is the @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the black hole radius . and",
    "the second term of the integrand is the form of the bondi energy .",
    "however , the second term become vanish because we only treat spherically symmetric spacetime i.e. the vaidya spacetime .",
    "then the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes as , @xmath16 in this paper we use this simple equation .",
    "we can easily calculate the timelike dynamical horizon equation only replacing @xmath17 and @xmath12 . and",
    "the way of 3 + 1 and 2 + 1 decomposition is replaced .",
    "the vaidya metric is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath9 are functions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is null vector and @xmath21 is the area radius , and @xmath23 is the mass defined by @xmath24 , a function of @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ". this metric is spherically symmetric . by substituting the vaidya metric ( 2 ) into the einstein equation so that we can identify the energy - momentum tensor @xmath25 as @xmath26 we do not need to check that the solution of the dynamical horizon equation satisfies the einstein equation .",
    "because we would like to consider the schwarzschild like metric , we set @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is tortoise coordinate with dynamics @xmath29 for later convenience , we write , @xmath30 there are two null vectors , @xmath31 corresponding to the null vector @xmath22 , and the other is @xmath32 here we multiply @xmath33 so that @xmath34 .",
    "this choice of the null vector @xmath3 is explained in figure [ fig5 ] .    0.1 in    ( 17.7000 , 12.1000 ) ( 7.9000,-18.5000 )    ( 11.6000,-13.9000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath3(7.9000,-13.8000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath17(9.7000,-19.3000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath35(11.4000,-16.7000)(0,0)[lb]@xmath5    from now on we put , @xmath36 in a similar form to the schwarzschild metric , assuming that @xmath37 is a function of @xmath20 only .",
    "for a constant @xmath23 , the metric coincides with the schwarzschild metric . we calculate the expansions @xmath2 and @xmath38 of the two null vectors @xmath39 , because the definition of the dynamical horizon requires one of the null expansions to be zero and the other to be minus .",
    "the result is , @xmath40 from @xmath41 we get , @xmath42 we can check that the other null expansion @xmath43is strictly negative .",
    "therefore in this case , we can apply the dynamical horizon equation . in the usual schwarzschild metric with dynamics ,",
    "both expansions become zero .",
    "this is the one of the reasons why we choose the vaidya metric . by inserting equation ( 7 ) to equation ( 14 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath44 note that @xmath45 is proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "now we solve @xmath41 , to determine the dynamical horizon radius as @xmath46 from this equation we obtain , @xmath47 here @xmath48 is also the solution of the dynamical horizon .",
    "the dynamical horizon radius @xmath49 is given by solving ( 17 ) as @xmath50 note that this dynamical horizon radius is outside the @xmath51 , that is othor solution .",
    "at first , we should derive the energy - momentum tensor @xmath52 for the integration of the dynamical horizon equation .",
    "for this end we derive it from the given vaidya matter . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the non - vanishing components of the energy - momentum tensor becomes @xmath54 here we have made the coordinate transformation from @xmath21 to @xmath28 .",
    "writing @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 given by ( [ f45])([f46 ] ) with @xmath34 , we see @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the unit vector in the direction of @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61 for the dynamical horizon integration ( [ eq2 ] ) , we get @xmath62 where we have used @xmath63 and the fact @xmath64 changing the integration variable from @xmath49 to @xmath23 . in the above calculation , we treat @xmath65 and @xmath66 with @xmath49 fixed , because these functions are used only in the integration . inserting equation ( [ f52 ] ) to the dynamical horizon equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath67 taking the limit @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 this equation is the dynamical horizon equation in the case that only the vaidya matter is present .",
    "there is no solution of this equation , except the trivial one ( @xmath48 or @xmath51 ) , so @xmath70 here @xmath37 is the arbitrary function only of the @xmath20 , which represent the vaidya black hole spacetime .",
    "+  next , we take into account the hawking radiation . to solve this problem ,",
    "we use two ideas that is to use the dynamical horizon equation , and to use the vaidya metric .",
    "the reason to use the dynamical horizon equation comes from the fact that we need only information of matter near horizon , without solving the full einstein equation with back reaction being the fourth order differential equations , for a massless scalar field . for the matter on the dynamical horizon , we use the result of candelas @xcite , which assumes that spacetime is almost static and",
    "is valid near the horizon , @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 where we have used a well known result , @xmath73 and where @xmath74 .",
    "this matter energy is negative near the event horizon . in the dynamical horizon equation ,",
    "if black hole absorbs negative energy , black hole radius decreases .",
    "this is one of the motivations to use the negative energy tensor .",
    "next we replace length of @xmath75 to unit length , because in the dynamical horizon equation @xmath76 is used , so @xmath77 and therefore , the energy tensor becomes @xmath78 calculating the integration on the right hand side of ( [ eq2 ] ) for this matter , @xmath79 here we insert the expression for @xmath49 ( [ f43])in the first line , and the expression for @xmath80 is used . here",
    "@xmath81 is a constant calculated in @xcite @xmath82 if we also take account of the contribution of the vaidya matter , and inserting this into the integration to the dynamical horizon equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath83 taking the limit @xmath68 , we finally get @xmath84 or @xmath85 this is the main result of the previous work that describes how the mass of black hole decreases .",
    "this equation is the transcendental equation , so usually it can not be solved analytically .",
    "however , with the right hand side depending only on @xmath86 , we can easily treat eq.([f4 ] ) numerically .",
    "figure [ plot ] is a graph of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath20 .     as a function of v from the equation ( [ f4]),width=188 ]    by the previous study we found that black hole finally vanish at @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the limit of the @xmath86 is the solution of the following equation as , @xmath89",
    "the result of subsection2 - 3 use candela s approximation@xcite .",
    "however , we would like to solve the dynamical horizons equation without approximation .",
    "so we use stress - energy tensor of massless scalar field . by the similar approach ,",
    "we can obtain following equation as @xmath90 here , @xmath91 is the massless scalar field .",
    "the calculations of the integrand of the first term becomes as , @xmath92 @xmath93 then the first term becomes as @xmath94 then the dynamical horizons equation [ eq5 ] becomes as , @xmath95 using the equation ( [ eq7 ] ) and by derivative of @xmath23 , we can finally obtain following equation as , @xmath96 here , @xmath97 .",
    "this equation is main result of our works in this paper .",
    "this equation is the second order ordinal differential equation with non - linear term .",
    "this equation can not be solved by analytical method , but it can be solved numerical method . the equation is the simple form of the field equation .",
    "when black hole vanishes , the approximation of the subsection [ sec2 - 3 ] is correct , then the denominator of the equation ( [ eq8 ] ) becomes 0 .",
    "and the equation ( [ eq8 ] ) becomes diverge .",
    "it means the derivative of the field diverges , and it means schwarzschild spacetime becomes euclidean spacetime .    if the @xmath98 become infinity , the equation becomes simple as @xmath99    next we consider when black hole vanish .",
    "using the following relation @xmath100 we can simplify the equation ( [ eq8 ] ) as @xmath101 because of numerical calculation , we solve @xmath102 then we obtained the @xmath103 .",
    "so the equation ( [ eq9 ] ) becomes as , @xmath104 here , @xmath105 . more simplicity we put the right hand side of eq.([eq10 ] ) as constant @xmath106 , then we can solve this equation . and",
    "the solution becomes @xmath107.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the large @xmath106 and small @xmath98 this function behaves like proportional function .",
    "and when black hole banishes , the function @xmath108 becomes @xmath109 .",
    "we can say black hole finally vanishes by the hawking effect by our study as we first prove @xcite .",
    "the reason why we enter freedom of the field is that we would like to check generalized second low of the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the main result of present paper is eq.([eq8 ] ) . by this result , numerical calculation of the field equation can be simplified . by our study",
    "we can show the field closes zero in the limit of the black hole evaporation .",
    "so we can say that the generalized second low of the black hole thermodynamics is collapsed in this semi - classical approach .",
    "the main problem of our work is at the point that our approach is semi - classical one , i.e. the gravity is classical and the field is the quantum one .",
    "so we should quantize gravitation . and",
    "our work may be enlarged to the charged black holes and the carr black hole .",
