    "the vlasov equation models the dynamics of a large number of interacting particles , when the force acting on them is dominated by the mean - field .",
    "it is a fundamental equation of plasma physics and galactic dynamics , but also describes a number of other physical systems , such as wave - particles interactions @xcite , free electron lasers  @xcite , certain regimes of nonlinear optics  @xcite , and wave propagation in bubbly fluids  @xcite .",
    "understanding its qualitative behavior has proved to be a formidable challenge , from the first linear computations of landau  @xcite to the most recent mathematical breakthroughs  @xcite .",
    "we address here a problem of bifurcations in these systems .",
    "the study of bifurcation of _ homogeneous _ stationary solutions to the vlasov equation ( when particles are homogeneously distributed in space , with a certain velocity distribution ) has a long and interesting history , mainly related to plasma physics ; a detailed account can be found in  @xcite .",
    "one of the main question is to determine the asymptotic behavior of the system , when started close to an unstable stationary state .",
    "the basic mechanism , ultimately responsible for the instability saturation , is the _ resonance _ phenomenon : particles with a velocity close to that of the growing mode are strongly affected by the small perturbation .",
    "this was qualitatively recognized in the 1960 s  @xcite , leading these authors to predict the famous `` trapping scaling '' , that is the asymptotic electric field , after nonlinear saturation , would be of order @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the instability rate . however , formal computations relying on standard nonlinear expansions often led to the very different @xmath2 scaling ( see discussion and refs in @xcite ) .",
    "in the 1990 s , crawford s careful unstable manifold computations finally recovered unambiguously the trapping scaling  @xcite . yet , his expansion is plagued by strong divergences in the @xmath3 limit .",
    "soon after , del - castillo - negrete derived an infinite dimensional reduced model for the instability development , using different techniques  @xcite .",
    "this is currently the best understanding we have , and shows a striking degree of universality .",
    "understanding the non homogeneous case is further challenging , and has a practical importance for various physical systems .",
    "a first key example comes from astrophysics .",
    "radial orbit instability destabilizes a spherical self - gravitating system when the number of low angular momentum particles , usually stars , grows .",
    "the fate of the initially unstable system has been qualitatively and numerically studied in @xcite , providing a rare example of such a bifurcation study . in the plasma physics context ,",
    "bernstein - greene - kruskal exhibited a large family of exact solutions of the vlasov - poisson equation @xcite , now commonly called bgk modes .",
    "some of these solutions are stable , others unstable @xcite .",
    "the non linear behavior in case of instability is an open question .    to tackle the bifurcation in the non homogeneous case we will consider in this article as a first step the case of a real unstable eigenvalue , for a one dimensional system .",
    "we will show that the number of particles around zero frequency is negligible in the non homogeneous case compared to the homogeneous case .",
    "this is a crucial remark , since it implies that for non oscillating instabilities , the resonance phenomenon will be absent , or strongly suppressed .",
    "nevertheless , similarly to the homogeneous case , the unstable eigenvalue still bifurcates from a marginally stable continuous spectrum .",
    "thus , one should expect a new type of bifurcation .",
    "our strategy is to attack this problem by revisiting crawford s expansion , in order to describe the dynamics on the unstable manifold .",
    "the basic questions are : does the instability saturate at small amplitude ? what is the analog of the `` trapping scaling '' ?",
    "can we expect the same kind of universality as in the homogeneous context ?",
    "our main results include : i ) a striking asymmetry on the unstable manifold : one branch leads to a small amplitude saturation , the other escapes far away from the original stationary point .",
    "ii ) the @xmath0 `` trappping scaling '' , well known in the homogeneous case , generalizes for the small amplitude saturation ; however , the reason for this scaling is very different .",
    "this result can also be reached by a different theoretical approach , following @xcite .",
    "iii ) since these features depend on some generic physical characteristic of the problem , we expect our results to be generic , at least for 1d systems .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows : section [ sec : gen ] deals with a general one - dimensional vlasov equation .",
    "we first explain formally how to obtain the unstable manifold expansion and emphasize the main physical points ( section [ sec : gen1 ] ) , then present a more detailed computation ( section [ sec : gen2 ] ) . in section [ sec : cosine ] , we restrict to a particular cosine interaction potential .",
    "we are then able to perform more explicit computations , and provide precise predictions , as well as push the computations at higher orders , which is crucial to understand the divergence pattern of the expansion ( section [ sec : higher_orders ] ) .",
    "we also show how some of these predictions can also be obtained via the `` rearrangement formula '' idea , recently introduced  @xcite ; this provides an independent theoretical approach ( section [ sec : rearrangement ] ) . in section [ sec : simulations ] , we compare all previous predictions with direct numerical simulations .",
    "the choice of the cosine potential allows us to perform very precise computations .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to some final comments and open questions .",

    "to summarize , we have elucidated for one - dimensional vlasov equations the generic dynamics of a non oscillating instability of a non homogeneous steady state .",
    "we have shown in particular : i ) due to the absence of resonances , the physical picture is very different from the homogeneous case ; ii ) a striking asymmetry : in one direction on the unstable manifold , the instability quickly saturates , and the system reaches a nearby stationary state , in the other direction the instability does not saturate , and the dynamics leaves the perturbative regime ; iii ) for an instability rate @xmath1 , the nearby stationary state is at distance @xmath326 from the original stationary state .",
    "direct numerical simulations of the vlasov equation with a cosine potential have confirmed these findings , and furthermore suggested that this phenomenology may have relevance for initial conditions that are not on the unstable manifold .",
    "these results are generic for 1d vlasov equations",
    ". it will be of course important to assess if they can be extended to two- and three - dimensional systems .",
    "the structure of the reduced equation on the unstable manifold , which underlies the asymmetric behavior , should be valid in any dimension .",
    "however , the crucial physical ingredient underlying our detailed computations leading to the @xmath326 scaling is the absence ( or the weak effect ) of resonance between the growing mode and the particles dynamics .",
    "this has to be carefully analyzed in higher dimensions , and is left for a future study .",
    "let us note that the findings of @xcite regarding the nonlinear evolution of the radial orbit instability are in agreement with this picture : they start from a weakly unstable spherical state ; close to this reference state , they find an axisymmetric weakly oblate stationary state ; at finite distance from the reference state ( outside the perturbative regime ) , they find a stable prolate stationary state .",
    "this is consistent with the asymmetric behavior we predict on the unstable manifold .",
    "an open question regards the stability of the new weakly oblate stationary state : in our numerical examples , it seems stable , but very close to threshold . in @xcite",
    "they claim it is unstable , but since their numerical simulations are much less precise , this could be a numerical artefact .",
    "finally , the possibility of an infinite dimensional reduced dynamics , as in @xcite , remains open .",
    "we have also restricted ourselves in this article to a real unstable eigenvalue .",
    "it is obviously worthwhile to investigate the bifurcation with a complex pair of eigenvalues .",
