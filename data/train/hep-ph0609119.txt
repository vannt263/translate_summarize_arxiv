    "little higgs models  @xcite have been proposed as a solution to the hierarchy problem , the vast difference between the scales of electroweak symmetry breaking and the scale where quantum effects of gravity can no longer be neglected .",
    "the higgs boson emerges as a pseudo - goldstone boson of spontaneously broken chiral symmetries of a strongly interacting theory in the multi - tev regime .",
    "the quadratically divergent contributions to the higgs mass are canceled  unlike in supersymmetry  by particles of like statistics , chiral multiplet partners of the standard model ( sm ) fermions .",
    "the collective breaking of these symmetries generates a quadratically - divergent correction to the higgs mass only at two - loop order , such that the models remain weakly interacting at the tev scale , thereby satisfying electroweak precision data constraints .",
    "ideas about possible uv completions exist  @xcite , but we ignore them in this paper and take little higgs models as low - energy effective theories .",
    "various realizations of the little higgs symmetry structure have been proposed  @xcite , grouped quite generally into two classes  ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the original models are mostly product group models , where the electroweak gauge group is extended to a product gauge group that contains @xmath1 subgroups in at least two distinct factors . the physical @xmath2 and @xmath0 bosons are mixtures of the gauge bosons from both factors .",
    "the global symmetry group is a simple group that includes the full gauge structure [ e.g. , @xmath3 , and the higgs is part of an irreducible multiplet of pseudo - goldstone bosons . in simple group models ,",
    "the electroweak @xmath1 gauge group is embedded in a simple ( e.g. , @xmath4 ) gauge group , while the global symmetry group has a product structure , and the higgs is a mixture of the components of several ( at least two ) independent irreducible representations of the factor groups .",
    "although these models remain weakly interacting at the tev scale , nevertheless electroweak precision observables pose constraints on their parameter space  @xcite  .",
    "the decay constant @xmath5 of the pseudo - goldstone bosons which sets the mass scale for the additional vector bosons , scalars and fermions in little higgs models , has to lie in the range @xmath6  tev , where the upper bound comes from naturalness considerations .",
    "usually the masses of the additional particles lie in the range of several hundred gev up to a few tev , and are therefore ( partly ) directly accessible at the lhc  ( for an overview about little higgs phenomenology , cf .",
    "the proof of the little higgs mechanism within these models relies on the discovery of the nonlinear goldstone boson structure of the higgs and the cancellation mechanism of the quadratic divergences based on measurements of the couplings .",
    "this will not be possible in all cases at the lhc , but should be at a future international @xmath7 collider ( ilc ) .",
    "an ilc would in any case be necessary for precision measurements .",
    "to reveal a special group theoretical realization of little higgs models is also quite difficult and relies on precise branching ratio measurements for the higgs , the extra gauge bosons and fermionic states . a method to distinguish between simple and product group models , maybe even already at the lhc , would be highly welcome .",
    "we propose a method based on the discovery and the properties of light pseudoscalar states in the spectrum , the little higgs pseudo - axions  @xcite .",
    "we first recall their properties , then show that a specific pseudo - axion coupling , to the higgs and the @xmath0 bosons , can occur only in simple group models .",
    "it could thus be used as a discriminator between the two little higgs model classes .",
    "we then discuss relevant phenomenology at the lhc and ilc .",
    "in little higgs models , there can occur spontaneously broken ( approximate ) global @xmath8 symmetries , corresponding to diagonal generators of the overall non - abelian global symmetry group  @xcite .",
    "to each of these @xmath8 factors , which might well be anomalous , corresponds a ( pseudo- ) goldstone boson which couples to fermions like a pseudoscalar , analogous to the @xmath9 meson in chiral symmetry breaking of qcd .",
    "such a particle is an electroweak singlet , which gets a mass through explicit symmetry breaking terms and the coleman - weinberg potential .",
    "all couplings to sm particles are therefore suppressed by the ratio of the electroweak and the little higgs scale , @xmath10 .",
    "all couplings to sm gauge bosons are induced by anomalous triangle loops . as a typical example for these particles ,",
    "we show the situation for the so - called simplest little higgs or @xmath11model  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : par_space ] . since this is a simple group model ,",
    "there are two multiplets of goldstone bosons connected by a mixing angle @xmath12 as in two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "furthermore , there is an explicit breaking of the global little higgs symmetries , analogous to the @xmath11 term in the mssm .",
    "pseudo - axion phenomenology at the lhc and future ilc and photon colliders was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that in the simplest little higgs there is a tree - level coupling @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 of the pseudo - axion to the higgs and the @xmath0 , which can only arise by electroweak symmetry breaking , and is enhanced by @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown that this coupling is absent in the simplest candidate of the product group models , the littlest higgs .",
    "we now show that the existence of such a @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling is a property of simple group models , and that it can not appear in product group models .",
    "hence , it serves as a discriminator between the two categories .",
    "the crucial observation is that the matrix - representation embedding of the two non - abelian @xmath1 gauge groups , and especially of the two @xmath8 factors within the irreducible multiplet of the pseudo - goldstone bosons of one simple group ( e.g. @xmath15 in the littlest higgs ) , is responsible for the non - existence of this coupling in product group models .",
    "it is exactly the mechanism which cancels the quadratic one - loop divergences between the electroweak and heavy @xmath1 gauge bosons which cancels this coupling . in simple group models the higgs mass term cancellation",
    "is taken over by enlarging @xmath1 to @xmath4 , and the enlarged non - abelian rank structure cancels the quadratic divergences in the gauge sector  but no longer forbids the @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling .    to leading order in the pseudo - axion field @xmath14 , the parameterization of the goldstone boson manifold in the effective lagrangian does not depend on the basis choice of the broken generators  @xcite",
    ". therefore one can take it proportional to the unit matrix , i.e. factor it out from the matrix of pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "this corresponds to a separation of the special @xmath16 group ( cf . also the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) . here",
    "we use @xmath17 $ ] for the pseudo - axion field and @xmath18 $ ] for the non - linear representation of the remaining goldstone multiplet @xmath19 of higgs and other heavy scalars .",
    "then , for product group models , the kinetic term may be expanded as @xmath20    & = \\ldots + f^2 ( \\partial_\\mu \\xi ) \\xi^\\dagger    { \\mathop{\\rm tr}}\\left [ ( d^\\mu \\sigma)^\\dagger \\sigma \\right ]    + { \\text{h.c.}}\\nonumber\\\\    & = \\ldots - 2f(\\partial_\\mu \\eta)\\ ,    { \\text{im}}{\\mathop{\\rm tr}}\\left [   ( d^\\mu \\sigma)^\\dagger \\sigma \\right ]    + o(\\eta^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we write only the term with one derivative acting on @xmath21 and one derivative acting on @xmath22 .",
    "this term , if nonzero , is the only one that can yield a @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling .",
    "we now use the special structure of the covariant derivatives in product group models , which is the key to the little higgs mechanism : d_= _ + a_1,^a ( t_1^a + ( t_1^a)^t ) + a_2,^a ( t_2^a + ( t_2^a)^t ) , where @xmath23 are the generators of the two independent @xmath1 groups ( extra gauge structure does not matter ) , and @xmath24 + heavy fields in a suitable normalization ( cf . ref .",

    "the same is true when we include additional @xmath8 gauge group generators such as hypercharge , since their embedding in the global simple group forces them to be traceless as well .",
    "we conclude that the coefficient of the @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling vanishes to all orders in the @xmath26 expansion .",

    ", one gets for the term in parentheses in eq .",
    "( [ kin : simplegroup ] ) : @xmath34 the @xmath31 entry can only be nonzero from the third term on .",
    "this can be understood as follows . in the first term",
    ", the @xmath31 component cancels by the help of the multiple goldstone multiplets present in the simple group models ; it would be a mixing between the @xmath14 and the goldstone boson(s ) for the @xmath35 state(s ) .",
    "if the @xmath31 component of the second term were nonzero , it would induce a @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling without insertion of a factor @xmath36 .",
    "this is forbidden by electroweak symmetry . to see this ,",
    "it is important to note that @xmath37 in the simple group models while the hypercharge boson @xmath38 is a mixture of the diagonal @xmath8 generator and the left - over diagonal generators in @xmath4 ( @xmath39 in @xmath40 , @xmath41 in @xmath42 , etc . ) .",
    "the embedding of the standard model gauge group always works in such a way that hypercharge is a linear combination of the @xmath43 and @xmath8 generators .",

    "higgs bosons in an intermediate mass range could be reconstructed at an ilc  @xcite fairly well , and although there would be combinatorial background in the @xmath157 channel , this would not degrade the pseudo - axion search .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : finalzhh ] shows the cross section to @xmath143 , where a cut on the dijet invariant mass has been applied to reduce the sm higgsstrahlung background which is shown as a dashed line .",
    "again , the dotted line is the prediction without a low - lying @xmath35 , while the solid line shows the destructive @xmath0@xmath35 interference . for the golden point with @xmath158  tev and @xmath105",
    ", there is a critical point at @xmath159  gev where the pseudo - axion and higgs boson are degenerate ( at @xmath160  gev ) .",
    "but vector boson - mediated production can not yield two identical particles ( under the assumption of cp conservation ) ; hence this must be either a scalar and a pseudoscalar or a scalar and a vector . from the normalization of the @xmath110 peak , which does not fit to the higgs boson",
    ", one could deduce that on one side of the event there must be a degenerate pseudoscalar present .",
    "the best case is where @xmath110 is the dominant @xmath14 decay mode , i.e. for pseudoscalar masses below 250  gev .",
    "the sm background is mainly higgsstrahlung with @xmath161 decay , which can be distinguished from the signal by applying a cut to the @xmath110 invariant mass . for the parameter space under consideration",
    ", the higgs decays to a vector boson pair which can be measured semi - leptonically .",
    "[ fig : finalhbb ] shows the cross section for the production of a higgs boson in association with a @xmath110 pair , on the left for a pseudo - axion mass of 200  gev , on the right for an extremely light @xmath14 with @xmath162  gev . for the former case one can cut out all bottom quark pairs below 150  gev to get rid of the @xmath0 background ;",
    "while this is not a very rigorous cut , it already reduces the sm background to a negligible level . to extract the light pseudoscalar",
    "we adopt a window between 30 and 70  gev for @xmath163 .",
    "again , fig .",
    "[ fig : finalhbb ] shows as a dotted line the cross section without @xmath35 interference , and solid with the @xmath164  tev . in both cases",
    "a few hundred @xmath165 should suffice to observe @xmath13@xmath14 production in that channel and thus establish the presence of a @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling .",
    "we have identified an important distinction between product group and simple group little higgs models crucially involving the pseudo - axion corresponding to ungauged diagonal generators in the former case , and the pseudoscalar combination of anomalous @xmath8 diagonal generators in the latter . by consideration of quantum numbers alone , a coupling between the pseudo - axion , higgs boson and @xmath0 gauge boson is allowed . however , by construction such a coupling must vanish to all orders in product ( gauge ) group models , where the _ global _ little higgs symmetry group is simple . in simple group models",
    "it is proportional to the difference between the vevs of the chiral field which occur in pairs . observing resonant production at the lhc",
    ", either @xmath109 or @xmath106 , or drell - yan @xmath131 production in @xmath7 collisions , would conclusively rule out a product group realization of the little higgs mechanism were a candidate little higgs found at the lhc .",
    "note , however , that this coupling would also vanish in simple group models with an imposed t - parity  @xcite , as the discrete symmetry forces @xmath80 .",
    "the phenomenology at lhc is in principle straightforward , breaking down into three classes , depending on whether the pseudo - axion or higgs boson is heavier , and whether the higgs boson decays primarily to a pair of bottom quarks or @xmath2 gauge bosons .",
    "we find that observation of @xmath166 is in general possible only for a very small range in @xmath11 , where the higgs boson is light enough to decay to bottom quarks but is not yet ruled out by the lep results . for small values of @xmath5 , 12  tev , this could be achieved at lhc with a reasonable few hundred inverse femtobarn of luminosity , but for large values of @xmath5 , a few tev , the @xmath14 is more massive thus harder to produce , so only the luminosity - upgraded lhc ( slhc ) would have a chance of observation of this coupling .",
    "( this would furthermore probably require different cuts , such as a less restrictive @xmath167 cut in the @xmath90 analysis , which likely would allow much more background from @xmath100 . ) for similar values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the coupling is too small .",
    "if the higgs boson is heavier , one generally loses as it preferentially decays to two longitudinal gauge bosons rather than @xmath107 , so the br drops to negligible values .",
    "if the pseudo - axion is resonant but the higgs boson decays to gauge bosons , a multi - lepton analysis works extremely well , especially for @xmath5 around 12  tev : even a few inverse femtobarn cover much of the possible parameter space .",
    "however , we find that lhc has large gaps in coverage , for regions where neither the higgs boson nor the pseudo - axion can be resonant .",
    "this is precisely where a linear collider would be crucial .    at a future linear collider",
    "the detection of the pseudo - axion would be quite easy using the @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling in scalar pair production .",
    "the cross section for the whole parameter space is large enough to give several hundred pseudo - axions for reasonable luminosity , irrespective of any of @xmath109 or @xmath106 being on - shell .",
    "this closes the holes in the lhc discovery range .",
    "an important point is a destructive @xmath168 interference in that channel which is most severe for the lowest @xmath5 scales but does not jeopardize the signal . in the case of an on - shell decay @xmath109 the @xmath142 final state is enhanced compared to the sm by a factor of at least two for the region favored by electroweak precision data and up to an order of magnitude for large @xmath12 .",
    "the same holds for the @xmath169 decay mode of the pseudo - axion where the enhancement over the sm is less pronounced .",
    "but here the pseudo - axion is easily visible even for bad signal to background ratio as a sharp peak in the @xmath170 invariant mass spectrum , whose width is completely given by the detector resolution .",
    "so even for mixing angles as small as @xmath171 the pseudo - axion coupling @xmath0@xmath13@xmath14 coupling can be detected at an ilc .",
