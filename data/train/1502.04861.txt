    "`` beamforming is a versatile and powerful approach to receive , transmit , or relay signals - of - interest in a spatially selective way in the presence of interference and noise '' @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of receive and transmit beamforming has been used to enhance coverage and data rate performance in amplify - and - forward ( af ) relay networks . distributed beamforming has been applied as a coherent transceiver technique in a variety of relay network architectures , such as single - user networks @xcite@xcite . in such networks",
    "one source transmits data to one destination .",
    "single - user networks have been extended to peer - to - peer networks , where multiple source - destination pairs communicate directly via relays @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , distributed systems of non - connected relays can be used for multicasting to transmit data from one source to many destinations simultaneously to avoid exhaustive individual transmissions @xcite@xcite .    the task to select the optimum antenna weights in centralized beamforming systems using a connected antenna array @xcite@xcite , or in distributed beamforming systems using a non - connected array @xcite@xcite for multicasting",
    "is highly non - trivial as it requires to form beams towards several destinations , each corresponding to a different spatial signature . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the problem of selecting the antenna weights for single - group multicasting is np - hard .",
    "until now , no polynomial time algorithm for np - hard problems is known and it is expected that exact solutions can only be computed within exponential time .    to derive adequate solutions to beamforming problems which belong to the class of non - convex quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problems ( qcqps ) , computationally efficient algorithms have been proposed which approximate the feasible set of the optimization problem @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "outer approximation techniques replace the qcqps by convex semidefinite programs ( sdps ) which can be solved efficiently @xcite@xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "the weight vector is replaced by a positive semidefinite hermitian matrix .",
    "since this so - called semidefinite relaxation ( sdr ) technique extends the feasible region , a solution matrix to the sdr problem lies not necessarily in the feasible set of the original problem .",
    "if the rank @xmath0 of the solution matrix @xmath1 equals to one , the sdr solution is a global solution to the original problem . in practice",
    ", however , @xmath0 might be greater than one and @xmath1 is not feasible for the original problem . especially in single - group multicasting scenarios , where many destinations demand a minimum received quality - of - service ( qos ) , it is not likely that @xmath2 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the existence of an sdr solution matrix with rank @xmath0 is only guaranteed if @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of destinations @xcite . if @xmath5 , the objective value of the sdr solution is only a lower bound to the objective value of the qcqp .",
    "the accuracy of the lower bound decreases with a growing number of destinations @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for multicasting with large @xmath4 , the lower bound generated by sdr can lie quite far from the true minimum value for rank - one beamforming .",
    "recently , in the two independent works @xcite and @xcite , rank - two transmit beamforming techniques for multicasting networks have been proposed in which also _ rank - two _ sdr solution matrices are feasible . in these techniques ,",
    "two weight vectors are used at the transmitter to process two data symbols jointly .",
    "rank - two beamforming techniques have gained much interest in the current research as the system performance is enhanced due to the increased number of degrees of freedom resulting from the additional weight vector @xcite , @xcite@xcite .    in this paper , we propose a distributed rank - two beamforming scheme for single - group multicasting using a network of amplify - and - forward ( af ) relays . in af multicasting networks , the relays forward common messages from a single source to multiple destinations .",
    "the proposed af single - group multicasting scheme ( afms ) is a non - trivial extension of the transmit beamforming technique of @xcite and @xcite to a distributed beamforming system .",
    "we refer to our scheme as the rank-2-afms in distinction to the conventional rank-1-afms of @xcite . as another generalization to the rank-1-afms ,",
    "we exploit direct link connections from the source to the destinations .    as the design criterion to select the power at the source and the relay weights",
    ", we aim to maximize the minimum qos at the destinations under constraints on the transmit power in the network .",
    "we consider constraints on the maximum transmit power of the source , on the individual power of every relay , on the sum power of the relays , and on the total power by both the relays and source .    to solve the non - convex max - min fairness optimization problem of jointly determining the relay weight vector and the power split between the relays and the source , we propose a linearization - based iterative algorithm . in advantage to the sdr technique , where the number of variables is roughly squared , the number of variables is not increased for cccp algorithms .",
    "cccp algorithms are used to approximately solve non - convex difference of convex ( dc ) programming problems .",
    "many optimization problems that arise in the context of wireless communications are dc problems , including power allocation @xcite@xcite and beamforming problems @xcite@xcite . in contrast to the algorithms for max - min fair beamforming of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which treat solely the optimization of beamforming vectors , our algorithm derives the relay weight vectors and allocates transmit power to the source and the relays .",
    "the max - min fair beamforming approaches in @xcite and @xcite combine the sdr technique with one - dimensional ( 1d ) search on the maximum qos . to compare our cccp algorithm ( max - min - cccp ) with the latter sdr - based algorithms ,",
    "we combine the sdr technique with two - dimensional ( 2d ) search on both the maximum qos and the best power split between the relays and the source .    to test the rank-2-afms and the rank-1-afms under realistic conditions , we use the channel model of @xcite .",
    "the simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed rank - two scheme combined with the proposed algorithm compared with the rank - one scheme of @xcite and the theoretical bound obtained by sdr .",
    "the max - min - cccp algorithm outperforms the sdr technique for high destination numbers at a much lower runtime .",
    "moreover , the max - min - cccp algorithm offers a good performance - runtime trade - off and achieves a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) which is less than 1 db lower than the theoretical bound after three iterations .",

    "we make the practical assumptions that the noise processes in the network are spatially and temporally independent and complex gaussian distributed .",
    "the noise power at the destinations is given by @xmath51 and the noise at the relays is distributed according to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the power of the noise at the relays .    here",
    ", the relays transmit their signals over two different beams . in this fashion",
    ", the proposed rank-2-afms enables the relays to create two different communication links from the source to each destination . in the conventional rank-1-afms of @xcite ,",

    ", the relays transmit their received signal vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 over the two weight vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the use of two weight vectors increases the degrees of freedom in the distributed beamformer design .",
    "in general , the superposition of multiple symbols that are simultaneously transmitted over different beams leads to difficulties in the decoding at the destinations . in our proposed rank-2-afms",
    "however , symbol - by - symbol detection at the destinations is facilitated by the particular spatial encoding scheme applied in equations ( [ relaytrans ] ) .",
    "the latter encoding scheme corresponds to the popular alamouti s ostbc scheme , in which two data symbols are transmitted over two spatial channels over consecutive time slots @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional ostbc schemes , which do not require the availability of channel state information ( csi ) at the transmitter , the rank-2-afms creates two `` artificial '' spatial channels which are shaped by choosing two beams with corresponding beamforming vectors that are designed based on csi . it is assumed that the perfect csi is available at a central processing node that computes the source power and the relay weights and communicates each parameter to its corresponding node .",
    "note that according to equations ( [ relaytrans ] ) , the signals transmitted by the relays consist of linear combinations of the received signals and their conjugates .",

    ", the number of degrees of freedom is increased due to the introduction of two linearly independent weight vectors .",
    "we remark that problem ( [ opt : maxminsdrafms ] ) still represents a non - convex problem , as the fractions of two linear terms in inequalities ( [ constraint_pr_sdr ] ) , ( [ constraint_pr_sdr ] ) , and ( [ opt : powerconstraintssdr ] ) represent non - convex functions .",
    "moreover , the multiplication of the two linear terms in the snr constraints ( [ opt : maxminsdrafms ] ) results in a non - convex function .",
    "one drawback of the sdr2d algorithm is its computational burden to solve an sdp in each iteration of the exhaustive 2d search .",
    "another drawback is that @xmath204 in general . in this case , the corresponding optimal value @xmath181 is only a lower bound for @xmath151 ( within the grid search precision ) as @xmath205 is not feasible for problem @xmath148 since there exists no rank - two decomposition @xmath202 . for cases in which the sdr solution is not feasible for the original problem ,",
