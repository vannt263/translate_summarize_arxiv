    "many explicit finite difference schemes originally applied to classical hydrodynamics have been employed to treat special relativistic hydrodynamics numerically .",
    "these schemes to solve the relativistic hydrodynamic equations are based on either exact or approximate solutions to the local riemann problem @xcite .",
    "some of these schemes adopt local characteristic decomposition of the jacobian matrix to build numerical fluxes .",
    "it is often difficult to build characteristic decomposition in some regimes , especially in ultrarelativistic limits , due to the degeneracy of the characteristic information .",
    "thus the use of an alternative scheme becomes sensible when the characteristic decomposition is unknown . the hll scheme proposed by @xcite for classical hydrodynamics",
    "is based on an approximate riemann solver that does not require full , and numerically expensive , characteristic decomposition .",
    "this feature of the hll scheme makes its use very attractive , especially in multidimensions , where computational efficiency and robustness is extremely important .",
    "this scheme was applied first to relativistic hydrodynamics by @xcite in one dimension and by @xcite in multidimensions .",
    "it is worth stressing that many treatments of relativistic astrophysical problems have assumed a ideal gas equation of state with a constant polytropic index , but this is a reasonable approximation only if the gas is either strictly subrelativistic or ultrarelativistic .",
    "however , when the gas is semirelativistic or when the gas has two components , e.g. , nonrelativistic protons and relativistic electrons , this assumption is no longer correct .",
    "this was shown for the relativistic perfect gas law by @xcite , where the exact form of an equation of state relating thermodynamic quantities of specific enthalpy and temperature is completely described in terms of modified bessel functions .    since the correct equation of state for the relativistic perfect gas has been recognized as being important , several investigations with a more general equation of state",
    "have been reported in numerical relativistic hydrodynamics .",

    ", @xcite studied the relativistic extragalactic jet deceleration through density discontinuities by using the synge - like equation of state with a variable polytropic index .    in this work",
    "we propose an analytical form of equation of state for the multi - component relativistic perfect gas that is consistent with the synge equation of state in the relativistic regime .",
    "this proposed equation of state is suitable for a numerical code from the computational point of view , unlike the synge equation of state , which involves the computation of bessel functions .",
    "we then build a multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamics code based on the hll scheme using the proposed equation of state , and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this code by presenting several test problems and numerical simulations .",
    "in particular , we plan to use this code to simulate relativistic extragalactic jets that are probably composed of a mixture of relativistic particles of different masses .",

    "the approximate propagation velocity of the jet through the homogeneous ambient medium can be derived from momentum flux balance between the beam and ambient medium in the reference frame of the working surface that separates beam and shocked ambient gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming pressure equilibrium between the beam and the ambient medium , the one - dimensional jet advance velocity , estimated in the rest frame of the ambient medium , is then @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 are given by @xmath196 and @xmath197 . here",
    "the subscripts @xmath198 and @xmath199 indicate the beam and the ambient medium , respectively .",
    "the morphology and dynamics of the relativistic jet propagating into the homogeneous medium is commonly specified by the beam to ambient medium density ratio @xmath194 , the beam lorentz factor @xmath195 , and the beam mach number @xmath200 .",
    "we have considered the three - dimensional simulations of relativistic jets using different equations of state .",
    "table [ tab2 ] lists the simulation parameters of the four different cases corresponding to the ideal gas equation of state with constant adiabatic index @xmath84 and @xmath85 and the proposed general equation of state for electron - positron and electron - proton gases . in all these cases ,",
    "we choose the beam density @xmath201 , the ambient medium density @xmath202 , the beam velocity @xmath203 and we assume that the beam is in pressure equilibrium with the ambient medium , @xmath204 .",
    "this gives the density contrast @xmath205 , the beam lorentz factor @xmath206 , and the beam mach number @xmath207 .",
    "the numerical simulations have been performed in the three - dimensional computational box with @xmath140 $ ] , @xmath141 $ ] , and @xmath208 $ ] using a uniform numerical grid of @xmath209 cells .",
    "the beam has an initial radius @xmath210 ( corresponding to @xmath211 cells ) , is launched from the origin , and propagates through a uniform static ambient medium along the positive @xmath24-direction .",
    "outflow boundary conditions are set at all boundaries except along the symmetry axis where reflecting boundary conditions are used and in the injection region where an inflow boundary condition is imposed to keep the beam constantly fed .",
    "the monotonized central limiter and the courant constant @xmath212 are used in all these jet propagation cases .",
    "the images in figure [ fig8 ] display the logarithms of the rest mass density on the plane @xmath192 at time @xmath213 for the four different cases in the simulations of relativistic axisymmetric jets .",
    "the bow shock , the beam , and the cocoon surrounding the beam can be clearly identified in all four cases , confirming the ability of our code to follow complex relativistic flows . for each case , a bow shock that separates the shocked jet material from the shocked ambient medium is driven into the ambient medium .",
    "the beam itself is terminated by a mach disk where much of the beam s kinetic energy is converted into internal energy .",
    "shocked jet material flows backward along the working surface into a cocoon , resulting in the development and mixture of turbulent vortices in the cocoon , and the interaction of these vortices with the beam forms oblique internal shocks within the beam close to the mach disk , which causes the deceleration of the jet .",
    "the four different cases , however , show differences in specific morphological and dynamical properties .",
    "the cold jet ( case a ) propagates at the slowest velocity , and the jet produces a broad bow shock , a thick cocoon , and has the mach disk located quite far behind the bow shock . on the contrary , the hot jet ( case b ) is dominated by a narrow bow shock , has a thin cocoon , and its mach disk lies very close to the bow shock , thanks to its having the fastest advance velocity .",
    "the electron - positron and the electron - proton jets ( cases c and d ) propagate faster than the cold jet , but slower than the hot jet .",
    "therefore , the electron - positron and the electron - proton jets possess morphological and dynamical properties intermediate between the cold and the hot jets . in terms of our simulation parameters",
    ", the electron - positron jet tends to be more similar to the cold jet , while the electron - proton jet seems to share more features with the hot jet .    in figure",
    "[ fig9 ] , the position of the bow shock is plotted as a function of time for the four different gases .",
    "the symbols mark the numerical estimate for a selected time interval for each case , and the lines represent the one - dimensional theoretical estimate in equation ( 32 ) .",
    "the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the one - dimensional theoretical estimates for the bow shock location for all cases .",
    "most numerical codes for special relativistic hydrodynamics have used the ideal gas equation of state with a constant adiabatic index , but this is a poor approximation for most relativistic astrophysical flows .",
    "we proposed a new general equation of state for a multi - component relativistic gas , based on the synge equation of state for a relativistic perfect gas @xcite .",
    "our proposed general equation of state is very efficient and suitable for numerical relativistic hydrodynamics since it has an analytic expression .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities computed using the proposed general equation of state behave correctly asymptotically in the limits of hot and cold gases . for intermediate regimes",
    "the thermodynamic quantities vary between those for the two limiting cases , depending on the composition of the relativistic gas .",
    "we also presented a multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamics code incorporating the proposed general equation of state for a multi - component relativistic gas .",
    "our numerical code is based on the hll scheme @xcite , which avoids a full characteristic decomposition of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations and uses an approximate solution to the riemann problem for flux calculations . since the numerical code is fully explicit , retaining a second - order accuracy in space and time , it is simple to extend the code to different geometries or to produce parallelized versions of this code .",
    "the analytical formulation of the proposed equation of state and the numerical scheme being free of complete characteristic decomposition make the code very efficient and robust in ultrarelativistic multidimensional problems .",
    "the accuracy and robustness of the code are demonstrated in two dimensions using the test problems of the relativistic shock tube and the relativistic shock reflection and in three dimensions using the test problem of the relativistic blast wave .",
    "the direct comparisons of numerical results with analytical solutions show that shocks and discontinuities are correctly resolved even in highly relativistic test problems with nonvanishing tangential velocities .",
    "results from the three - dimensional simulations of the relativistic axisymmetric jets demonstrate the ability of our code to follow complex relativistic flows as well as the flexibility enough to be applied to practical astrophysical problems .",
    "these simulations show that the morphology and dynamics of the relativistic jets are significantly influenced by the different equation of state and by different compositions of a relativistic perfect gas .",
