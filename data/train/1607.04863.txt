    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the @xmath4 meson and proton show different sensitivity on the hadronic rescatterings . as discussed previously , the @xmath4 meson is less sensitive to the late hadron hadron interactions than light hadrons due to the smaller hadronic cross section .",
    "it means light hadrons ( e.g. protons ) would gain larger additional radial flow which modifies the @xmath15(@xmath26 ) shape during final hadronic rescatterings .",
    "hydrodynamical model calculations predict that @xmath0 as a function of @xmath30 for different particle species follows mass ordering , where the @xmath0 of heavier hadrons is lower than that of lighter hadrons  @xcite .",

    "@xmath4 mesons and protons are chosen for the study , as their rest masses are quite close to each other .",
    "as the model calculations assign a smaller hadronic cross section for @xmath4 mesons compared to protons , the broken mass ordering is regarded as the different hadronic rescattering contributions on the @xmath4 meson and proton @xmath15 .",

    "it indicates breakdown of the expected mass ordering in that momentum range .",
    "this could be due to a large effect of hadronic rescatterings on the proton @xmath0 , which qualitatively agrees with hydro + hadron cascade calculations indicated by the shaded red band in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] . a centrality dependence of @xmath54 to @xmath47 ratio is observed in the experimental data .",

    "both hadronic and partonic interactions are stronger than in peripheral events .",
    "therefore , the larger effect of late stage hadronic interactions relative to the partonic collectivity produces a greater breakdown of mass ordering in the 0 - 30@xmath53 centrality data than in the 30 - 80@xmath53 .",
    "this observation indirectly supports the idea that the @xmath4 meson has a smaller hadronic interaction cross section .",

    "larger hadronic cascade time is equivalent to stronger hadronic interactions .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath50 ratio increases with increasing hadronic cascade time .",
    "this is attributed to a decrease in the proton @xmath0 due to an increase in hadronic re - scattering while the @xmath4 meson @xmath0 is less affected .",
    "the ratios from the urqmd model are much smaller than unity ( shown as a brown shaded band in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) .",

    "= 2.76 tev pb + pb collisions at lhc , there is an indication that the @xmath4 meson @xmath15 is larger than the proton @xmath15 for the lowest @xmath26 bin  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , currently the uncertainties on the alice @xmath4 meson @xmath15 measurements are too large to conclude .",
    "the number of constituent quark ( ncq ) scaling in @xmath0 in the intermediate @xmath30 range ( 2 @xmath27 @xmath26 @xmath27 5 gev/@xmath28 ) could be well reproduced by the quark coalescence  @xcite or recombination  @xcite mechanisms in particle production .",

    "figure  [ figure5 ] shows ncq scaling at lhc energy . the maximum deviation from ncq scaling is @xmath5220@xmath53 at @xmath25 = 2.76 tev as observed by alice experiment  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at top rhic energy , ncq scaling holds better than lhc energy .",
    "it indicates that coalescence is the dominant hadronization mechanism at rhic in the intermediate transverse momentum region ( 2 @xmath27 @xmath26 @xmath27 5 gev/@xmath28 ) .",
    "recently , cms collaboration presented the @xmath15 results of strange hadrons ( @xmath59 and @xmath8 ) in @xmath60 + pb collisions at @xmath25 = 5.02 tev with event sample of large multiplicity  @xcite . a nice ncq scaling ( less than 10% violation ) is observed .",
    "it indicates the partonic level collectivity has been build - up even in small @xmath60 + pb colliding system",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the ncq scaling using event samples with large and small multiplicity in the future .",
    "star experiment has covered the beam energies of @xmath25 = 7.7 , 11.5 , 14.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev . during year 2010 - 2014 , a beam energy scan program ( phase i ) was carried out at rhic .",
    "the main motivation is to explore the nuclear matter phase structure in the higher net - baryon region .",
    "the most striking feature on the @xmath15 measurements is the observation of an energy dependent difference in @xmath15 between particles and their corresponding antiparticles  .",
    "figure  [ figure6 ] shows the difference in @xmath15 between particles and their corresponding antiparticles as a function of beam energy .",
    "the difference between baryon and anti - baryon is much more pronounced than difference between mesons .",
    "proton versus anti - proton and @xmath8 versus @xmath61 show same magnitude of difference .",
    "this difference naturally breaks the number of constituent quark scaling ( ncq ) in @xmath15 which is regarded as an evidence of partonic collectivity in the top energy heavy ion collisions at rhic .",
    "it indicates the hadronic degrees of freedom play a more important role at lower collision energies .",
    "the data have also been compared to hydrodynamics + transport ( urqmd ) hybrid model  @xcite and nambu - jona - lasino ( njl ) model  @xcite which considers both partonic and hadronic potential .",
    "the hydrid model could reproduce the baryon ( proton ) data , but fails to explain the mesons ; whereas the njl model could qualitatively reproduce the hadron splitting . by tuning the @xmath62 parameter which is related to the partonic potential",
    ", njl model fails to reproduce the magnitude for all hadron species simultaneously .",
    "analytical hydrodynamic solution can reproduce the data within uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "it predicts @xmath63 for baryons .",
    "future high precise data will clarify the validity of this description .",
    "the @xmath26 differential @xmath15 could be modified by an increase on both collective and radial flow with increasing of colliding energy .",
    "it is qualitatively described by hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "the recently comparison between alice measurements and model calculations shows a nice agreement in @xmath64% central collisions including strange baryon @xmath8s and multi - strange baryon @xmath24s .",
    "however , for more central collisions ( e.g. @xmath65% ) a clear discrepancy is observed for protons , @xmath8s and @xmath24s  @xcite .",
    "later , it was realized the hadronic rescatterings would be important to be included in the hydrodynamic calculations for a fair comparison between data and models  @xcite . in the fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , viscous hydrodynamical calculations with(vishnu ) and without ( vish2 + 1 ) a hadronic cascade afterburner are compared .",
    "the increase in mass splitting between identified paritcles for vishnu ( solid curves ) compared to vish2 + 1 ( dashed curves ) illustrates the larger radial flow in the vishnu calculations due to the contribution of the hadronic cascade .",
    "the mass splitting between the pions and strange baryons ( @xmath8 ) / multi - strange baryons ( @xmath24 ) does not change much , as small hadronic rescattering cross sections are assigned to these particles . the mass ordering observed in pure viscous hydrodynamical calculations",
    "is not preserved anymore between protons and strange baryons ( @xmath8 ) / multi - strange baryons ( @xmath24 ) after including the hadronic interactions in vishnu .",
    "figure  [ figure8 ] shows the comparison between the @xmath26-differential @xmath15 measured by alice and the vishnu model . even though vishnu gives a better description of kaons , clear discrepancy for protons , @xmath8s and @xmath24s",
    "could be observed .",
    "the vishnu calculations under - predict the @xmath15 of protons and over - predict the @xmath15 of @xmath8s and @xmath24s .",
    "obviously , the current theoretical framework of viscous hydrodynamics plus a hadron cascade afterburner does not describe the @xmath15 as a function of @xmath26 for identified particles in more central collisions better .",
    "it indicates hadronic interaction process for some particle species might not be well understood .",
    "in this paper , i review the elliptic flow results of strange and multi - strange hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collision from rhic to lhc energies .",
    "the centrality and system size dependence of @xmath15 could be well described by number of participants in both and collisions at @xmath25 = 200 gev .",
    "the precise measurements of multi - strange hadron @xmath15 , especially for the @xmath29 baryons indicates the collectivity has been built - up in the early partonic stage of collisions .",
    "the comparison between the @xmath15 of @xmath4 mesons and protons shows a possible violation of hydrodynamics inspired mass ordering in @xmath66% central collisions .",
    "it can be qualitatively explained by the different effects of late hadronic interactions on the @xmath4 meson and proton @xmath15 .",
    "the ncq scaling of identified particles in top energy heavy ion collisions at rhic is better than lhc energy suggests coalescence is the dominant hadronization mechanism at rhic in the intermediate transverse momentum region ( 2 @xmath27 @xmath26 @xmath27 5 gev/@xmath28 ) .",
    "also , the ncq scaling is observed in small colliding system , @xmath60 + pb , at @xmath25 = 5.02 tev .",
    "it indicates the partonic level of collectivity has also been reached in high energy @xmath60 + pb collisions . at lower beam energy ( @xmath67 @xmath25 = 39 gev ) , a difference is observed between @xmath15 values of particles and anti - particles .",
    "currently there is no theoretical framework can reproduce the data quantitatively .",
    "the recently comparison between viscous hydrodynamic with a hadronic cascade afterburner and experimental data shows a discrepancy on the baryons which challenges the current knowledge on the hadronic interactions .",
