    "astronomers often divide the star formation process into a handful of neat phases ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we can for example think of star formation as proceeding through : ( 1 ) the fragmentation of a molecular cloud , resulting in filaments , cores , and any kind of localized collapsing objects ; ( 2 ) the collapse of these cores to form star - disk systems ; ( 3 ) the phase of disk accretion and evolution , which includes companion and planet formation and jet / outflow launching ; and ( 4 ) the termination of mass accretion ( due to outflows , ejection , competition with other sinks of cloud mass , magnetic support of envelopes , or other means ) that determines the final mass of a star . in this paper",
    "i review some recent work and add commentary on the first , third , and fourth phases of star formation as defined here .",
    "recent years have seen a renewed interest in filamentary structures in molecular clouds , thanks to the _ herschel space observatory _ observations of dust emission from molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "these observations reveal a filamentary network of dust emission that is present in both star - forming and non - star - forming clouds .",
    "this implies that the initial structure of molecular clouds may be an imprint of initial ( likely turbulent ) conditions and exists before self - gravity of the cloud can make a major impact and lead to star formation .",
    "furthermore , observations of a handful of molecular clouds in the gould belt have found that the average projected lateral width of the filamentary structures are clustered around 0.1 pc , even though the mean column density of the filaments vary by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "a mean width of filaments that clusters around @xmath0 pc is surprising because it is not consistent with expectations based on either self - gravitating equilibria or gravity - driven collapse . in either case a central flat region ( or fwhm )",
    "is essentially the hydrodynamic jeans scale evaluated at the central density .",
    "this means that its width @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath3 is the central column density .",
    "how are we to understand this result ?",
    "on one hand it could be some kind of observational bias .",
    "however , the resolution of herschel is about 0.01 pc at the distance of the gould belt clouds so we can rule out beam smearing .",
    "it is possible that the averaging technique can converge to a narrow range of mean widths even if the filaments intrinsically have a wide range of widths along their spine @xcite .",
    "one may even think of the filaments as an ensemble of collapsing cores that have narrow fwhm and wider regions that are not collapsing .",
    "what explains the widths of the non - collapsing regions ?",
    "this is probably an imprint of the filament formation process .",
    "in @xcite we proposed that the filaments are actually magnetic ribbons , part of the scenario of dynamically - oscillating molecular clouds supported by magnetic fields due to a large - scale subcritical mass - to - flux ratio . in this scenario molecular clouds are supported by magnetic fields , and the initial structure is inherited from initial conditions .",
    "if the initial conditions are turbulent , perhaps inherited from a larger scale turbulent cascade , then filamentary structure is naturally generated .",
    "these filaments differ from those in cosmological simulations that are driven purely by the gravity of the dark matter and collapse on a dynamical time . instead , these are quasi - equilibrium filaments ( really ribbons , with preferential flattening in the direction of the mean magnetic field ) that are in approximate force balance between turbulent ram pressure and the pressure and tension of the magnetic field .",
    "since the mass - to - flux ratio is subcritical , the ribbon can not collapse in the flux - freezing limit , and rebounds when the magnetic pressure equals the ram pressure .",
    "if the initial turbulent compression occurs on a characteristic scale @xmath4 , @xcite show that the equilibrium lateral thickness of the resulting ribbon is @xmath5^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the nonlinear flow speed and @xmath7 is the background alfvn speed .",
    "this thickness depends on @xmath4 but is independent of density , unlike the jeans scale .",
    "however , the ribbon is expected to be flattened preferentially along the magnetic field direction and have a thickness @xmath8 that is comparable to the jeans length . in this model we ignore turbulent pressure effects in the direction of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "figure  [ ribbon ] shows a schematic picture of the ribbon formation , with a turbulent flow that is in the plane perpendicular to a mean magnetic field along which the cloud is flattened .",
    "an ensemble of such ribbons will be observed at a random set of viewing angles , each with a unique projected width and line - of - sight column density .",
    "figure  [ widths ] shows the result of a synthetic set of projected widths generated for a random distribution of viewing angles .",
    "-0.5 cm @xmath9{f1.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    -0.5 cm @xmath9{f2.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]",
    "the magnetic ribbon scenario can explain why the observed widths can : ( 1 ) cluster around an approximately fixed width , since they are quasi - equilibrium objects and not on a one way path of collapse ; ( 2 ) why the widths are not wholly different that the jeans length , since one dimension has that width ; ( 3 ) why the observed polarization patterns imply a large scale magnetic field perpendicular to the filament .",
    "however , an explanation for a preferred wavelength @xmath4 for the background turbulence , of order 1 pc , remains an open issue .",
    "detailed self - consistent simulations of the formation of circumstellar disks from their parent cores and their further evolution shows that the mass accretion rate @xmath10 at small scales near the star can differ considerably from the mass infall rate onto the disk . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite we have shown that @xmath10 in the disk is episodic and characterized by bursts with @xmath11 yr@xmath12 that result from gravitational instability .",
    "the instability leads to fragmentation and the migration of the fragments to the protostar .",
    "the recurrent gravitational instability occurs while there is significant envelope accretion onto the disk , which can temporarily reduce the toomre @xmath13 parameter to be less than the critical value .",
    "this paradigm has become the standard one for early disk accretion , as the mean and median luminosity of protostars in star - forming regions are lower by about an order of magnitude than predicted from the standard spherical accretion models @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` luminosity problem '' can be resolved by episodic accretion coupled with a slowly declining mean accretion rate @xcite .",
    "figure  [ macc ] shows the time evolution of @xmath10 at both an inner radius ( black solid lines ) and an outer radius ( red dashed lines ) characteristic of envelope infall , in three models with different initial core masses @xmath14 as labeled .",
    "the main elements of stellar mass accretion are evident in these plots .",
    "the low mass model with @xmath15 illustrates all the phases .",
    "the @xmath10 near the center rapidly rises to a value @xmath16 upon the formation of a first hydrostatic core , where @xmath17 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "subsequently there is a smooth accretion until the formation of a centrifugal disk .",
    "although this occurs @xmath18 yr after the formation of the first core , this is a model dependent effect .",
    "the central sink cell sets the time for the start of disk accretion , since the centrifugal radius of infalling mass shells must reach the sink cell radius of 6 au for a disk to form in the simulation .",
    "higher resolution but one - dimensional simulations that also include non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics @xcite show that a disk actually forms immediately after the formation of a stellar core .",
    "all three panels of figure  [ macc ] shows that the disk accretion has a baseline rate that is well below the rate of infall onto the disk but is punctuated by bursts that temporarily increase @xmath10 by one to two or more orders of magnitude .",
    "this burst mode of accretion continues until the envelope accretion , which is a declining function of time due to a finite mass reservoir , drops to negligible values .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ macc ] shows that the disk accretion continues after this time in a power - law manner .",
    "this later evolution of @xmath10 is set by internal transport mechanisms of the disk , mainly gravitational torques arising from persistent nonaxisymmetric structure @xcite .",
    "the dependence @xmath19 with @xmath20 is indicative of a self - similar solution @xcite .",
    "the models with greater values of @xmath14 have not yet settled into the self - similar regime during the times shown , as the envelope infall continues for a longer time .",
    "the mass dependence of the rate of decline of the disk accretion rate is an important observable and merits a careful comparison with models . within the first @xmath21 myr of accretion",
    ", the objects with greater mass , accreting from more massive envelopes , will show a more rapid decrease of mass accretion rate than lower mass accretors .",
    "this is because the more massive object s accretion rate is still set by the envelope accretion rate onto the disk , while the lower mass object may have ended its phase of envelope - driven accretion and already settled into self - similar disk accretion . at later times , it is possible that @xmath10 may decline more rapidly for the low mass objects , as inferred in one observational study @xcite , due to photoevaporation of the inner disk due to x - ray and uv stellar flux @xcite .",
    "an interesting new prediction based on high - resolution modeling @xcite was that a mass accretion burst of fu ori magnitude could actually occur with a series of secondary bursts .",
    "this is due to the physics of clump infall that leads to the burst . in the late stages of infall to the center",
    ", the clump can be sheared apart and include secondary fragments .",
    "the mass infall can occur in the form of a clustered burst .",
    "figure  [ clumps ] shows the late stages of infall of a clump as it approaches the center .",
    "a clustered burst has very recently been confirmed in the fu ori object v346 @xcite .    -0.5",

    "despite claims that the observed core mass function ( cmf ) may be the explanation for the stellar ( and substellar ) initial mass function ( imf ) , there are roadblocks to the idea of a simple one - to - one mapping of the cmf to the imf .",
    "the discovery of an ever growing set of substellar objects , down to as low as @xmath23 , for example by @xcite , imply that direct collapse scenario would have to produce extremely low mass collapsing cores .",
    "the mean jeans mass in a molecular cloud is already as high as @xmath24 .    in the accretion scenario",
    ", there is still a cmf but it is not fundamentally important to determining the imf .",
    "the exact shape and mean value of a cmf depends on a variety of physical factors as well as the observational technique and definition of core boundaries .",
    "the cmf will inevitably be drawn toward a lognormal distribution due to the multiple effects of turbulence , magnetic fields , gravity , and temperature fluctuations",
    ". however , it need not be the cause of the imf , which may also resemble a lognormal for statistical reasons having to do with the central limit theorem .",
    "an attractive scenario is to think of star formation as a killed accretion process .",
    "since a protostellar seed or first hydrostatic core starts with a very low mass @xmath23 @xcite , the formation of substellar and stellar mass objects can be thought of as arising from a combination of mass accretion and a mechanism for termination of the accretion .",
    "accretion termination can arise from a variety of effects , including ejection from a multiple system of proto - objects in a disk @xcite , outflows from the protostar , and sweeping away of molecular cloud gas by feedback from a nearby high - mass star .",
    "if the distribution of accretion stopping times is @xmath25 , representing equally likely stopping ( els ) in equal time intervals , and the mass growth law is exponential , i.e. , @xmath26 , then the resulting normalized pdf for masses after accretion termination is @xmath27 \\ :",
    "m^{-1 - \\alpha }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\ : { \\rm erfc } \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left ( \\alpha \\sigma_0 - \\frac{\\ln m -\\mu_0}{\\sigma_0 } \\right ) \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the mean and dispersion of a starting lognormal distribution of masses which then undergo accretion growth , and @xmath30 is the dimensionless ratio of `` death '' rate to `` growth '' rate of protostars .",
    "the exponential growth law of protostars is an approximation to a two - stage process where we envision that the early stage accretion rate is nearly constant but later needs to increase rapidly if massive stars are to be formed .",
    "this is because of the relatively small age spread of stars in young clusters containing stars of widely varying masses @xcite .",
    "this modified lognormal power - law ( mlp ) model hypothesizes that the initial distribution of accreting protostellar seed masses is lognormal .",
    "however , a lognormal of very small dispersion @xmath31 approaches a delta function , and we may also think of the initial distribution as being essentially a delta function at the mass of the first hydrostatic cores , @xmath32 . this interpretation is aided by a newly derived mass function of the orion nebula cluster @xcite .",
    "their fit of a lognornal to the low mass data yields parameters that imply that the mode of the density function is @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34{f5.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]    @xmath34{f6.eps }   \\end{array}$ ]",
    "the sfde conference had a special session on magnetic fields and important points about the observability of magnetic fields were discussed . why are magnetic fields important to star formation studies ?",
    "the most important potential role of magnetic fields would be to ensure the observed low efficiency of star formation .",
    "this would primarily require that the mass - to - flux ratio in much of the cloud volume is subcritical .",
    "so far there is no equivocal direct evidence of this , as magnetic field detections are difficult enough in dense regions let alone in the low density regions of clouds .",
    "a strong magnetic field could also explain features like the magnetic ribbons described in this paper , and the striations that are observed perpendicular to large filaments @xcite .",
    "they could also provide a conduit for rapidly spreading kinetic energy throughout the cloud @xcite .",
    "neutral - ion slip must exist in molecular clouds since the neutrals can not feel any lorentz force but for a collisional interaction with ions that requires a relative drift between the two species .",
    "is it worthwhile to look for direct evidence of neutral - ion drift ?",
    "observational comparison of individual neutral and ionic species line widths can be problematic due to their differing ( and uncertain ) critical densities and optical depths .",
    "it is even more problematic to interpret any alleged systematic difference in the neutral and ion line widths based on a linear theory of alfvn waves in a uniform non - gravitating medium @xcite .",
    "since self - gravity is important in molecular clouds , particularly in clumps and cores , there should be a systematically greater line width of neutrals than ions due to unresolved _ gravitationally - driven _ ambipolar diffusion .",
    "this effect is typically only a fraction of the sound speed on a core scale . however , there is the possibility of high resolution observations of the protostellar collapse zone revealing an ambipolar diffusion shock at a typical distance @xmath35 au from a young stellar object @xcite . in this region ,",
    "the neutral infall motions are supersonic and the neutral - ion drift speed is also supersonic .",
    "the infall of neutrals , let alone ions , within an expansion wave @xcite , has yet to be characterized observationally and compared to theoretical models .",
    "how is the research field of star formation faring ?",
    "we have been encouraged by the organizers to express our opinions .",
    "all areas of human activity follow trends , and this field is no exception . in the 1980s",
    "the hot topic was the singular isothermal sphere , the 1990s saw the development of models with magnetic fields and then turbulence , the 2000s saw a resurgence of interest in the bonnor - ebert sphere and the core mass function , and the 2010s have focused a lot on filamentary structure .",
    "the field may have settled into chasing `` rabbits '' and we appear to be in a quiescent era of progress while the bursts of activity are happening in related areas of planetary and substellar objects or the application of star formation ( e.g. , star formation rate history and imf ) to the extragalactic and high redshift universe .",
    "population iii star formation may become a hot topic depending on the findings of the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) .",
    "there are still many outlets for research in star formation studies .",
    "although the core subject of molecular cloud structure may have stalled in my opinion , the big outstanding question is still to be solved .",
    "can magnetic fields or turbulence enforce a very low efficiency of star formation in molecular clouds ? if the former then we need to find evidence of subcritical mass - to - flux ratio in cloud envelopes .",
    "if the latter then we need to identify drivers of turbulence , either on the large scale or through stellar feedback .",
    "new high resolution observations that reveal ribbon - like structure or striations are interesting in my view insofar as they can help distinguish between scenarios , e.g. , magnetically - dominated or not .    stellar mass accretion is an interesting area with much theoretical and observational development in the last decade .",
    "the episodic accretion paradigm is now firmly established , and can be further explored with the _ atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array _ ( alma ) disk observations and the upcoming jwst ability to identify numerous low mass and substellar objects .",
    "even the imf may be understood as essentially an accretion process , and accretion models like the mlp can be constrained by new observations of the substellar and low mass imf .",
