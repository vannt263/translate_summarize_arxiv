    "light is the most common probe for investigating complex media at the mesoscopic scale as it offers both an excellent resolution and is non invasive at moderate energies .",
    "nonetheless , due to the inhomogeneous distribution of refractive index , light suffers multiple scattering while propagating in or through the medium .",
    "unveiling the complexity of light scattering then necessary to retrieve the features of an object of interest or of the surrounding environment . in an inhomogeneous medium , it is a classical approach to consider a scattering sample as one realization of a random process , and study statistical physical quantities such as the mean intensity @xcite . under this approach ,",
    "several physical parameters are relevant to characterize wave propagation in scattering media : the scattering mean - free path @xmath0 , the transport mean - free path @xmath1 , the diffusion constant @xmath2 , the absorption length @xmath3 .",
    "classical back scattering imaging techniques , such as optical coherence tomography , fail when multiple scattering predominates @xcite .",
    "however , one can still measure the long - scale spatial variations of the diffusive parameters .",
    "the resulting image is not an image of the refractive index @xmath4 but e.g. , of the diffusion constant @xmath5 with a resolution of the transport mean free path @xmath1 , at best . in the literature ,",
    "diffuse optical tomography is the gold standard technique to reconstruct the spatial distribution of transport parameters at each point of a volume from intensity measurements at the surface @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this inverse problem is intrinsically nonlinear with respect to the optical properties of the medium .",
    "this method is thus computationally intensive and limited in terms of spatial resolution @xcite ( e.g. 5 mm in human soft tissues ) .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple and approach that does not require any inversion procedure and provides a direct image of transport parameters with a spatial resolution of the order of a few transport mean free paths . experimentally , it relies on a passive measurement of time - dependent green s functions between every point at the surface of a scattering medium without the use of any coherent source .",
    "this method is based on the following fundamental result : the cross - correlation ( or mutual coherence function ) of an incoherent wave field measured at two points a and b can yield the time dependent green s function @xmath6 between these two points @xcite . previously developed in seismology",
    "@xcite , in acoustics @xcite and in the microwave regime @xcite , the green s function estimation from the cross - correlations of a diffuse wave - field has been recently extended to optics @xcite .",
    "the experimental set up employed for the passive measurement of the point - to - point green s functions at the surface of a scattering sample is displayed in fig .",
    "an incoherent broadband light source ( 650 - 850 nm ) isotropically illuminates a scattering sample .",
    "this incident wave - field exhibits a coherence time @xmath7 fs and a coherence length @xmath8 @xmath9 m @xcite.the backscattered wave - field is collected by a microscope objective and sent to a michelson interferometer , which is here used as a field correlator .",
    "the beams coming from the two interference arms are recombined and focused by a lens .",
    "a ccd camera conjugated with the sample surface records the output intensity .",
    "@xmath10 if the incident light is spatially and temporally incoherent , the time derivative of the correlation function @xmath11 should converge towards the difference of the causal and anti - causal green s function @xcite , such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the time - dependent causal green s function between a point source at @xmath14 and a point detector @xmath15 .",
    "this fundamental result means that a passive correlation measurement mimics the following active experiment [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ] : ( i ) a virtual light source of size @xmath16 located at point @xmath14 emits a pulse of duration @xmath17 ; ( ii ) a virtual point - like receiver located at point @xmath15 records the time - resolved scattered wave - field .",
    "this property has been recently demonstrated in optics by retrieving the ballistic and multiple scattering components of the green s function between individual scatterers @xcite . following this experimental proof - of - concept",
    ", we here investigate the case of strongly scattering media .",
    "the first sample under study is a 80 @xmath9m - thick layer of @xmath18 nanoparticles .",
    "a set of time - dependent causal and anticausal green s functions , @xmath19 , has been measured following the experimental procedure described above and depicted in fig .",
    "when one tries to image an unknown medium from a set of green s functions , an important issue is the importance of multiple scattering relative to single scattering .",
    "multiple scattering is actually a nightmare for classical imaging techniques , which are based on the first born approximation .",
    "however , one can adopt a probabilistic approach and investigate statistical quantities such as the mean intensity@xcite .",
    "as the causal and anticausal green s functions are , by definition , nil for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , the mean intensity can be averaged over the positive and negative times , such that : @xmath22 where the symbol @xmath23 denotes an average over the ccd pixels , i.e over the position vector @xmath14 of the virtual source on the sample surface . as we shall see , the evolution of this quantity as a function of the source - receiver relative position @xmath24 and the time of flight @xmath25 allows to describe quantitatively the transport of light through the scattering medium under study .",
    "[ fig2 ] displays the spatio - temporal evolution of the mean intensity deduced from the set of point - to - point green s functions measured in the @xmath18 layer .",
    "each spatial intensity profile is then renormalized by its maximum at each time of flight @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b , c , d ) displays the result at different opds ( @xmath2610 , 50 and 100 m , respectively ) .",
    "not surprisingly , we retrieve the feature of a diffusive halo whose spatial extent increases with time at the same speed in all directions .",
    "this isotropic growth is easily accounted for by the fact that the @xmath18 nanoparticles are small compared to the wavelength , randomly packed and display an isotropic differential cross - section .",
    "now that we have observed qualitatively the diffusive spreading of the mean intensity , we aim to precisely characterize the scattering properties of the medium with a quantitative measurement of the diffusion constant @xmath2 .",
    "theoretically , the multiple scattering intensity can be split into two terms .",
    "first , the incoherent contribution , denoted as @xmath27 , corresponds to the interference of the wave with itself . in the deep multiple scattering regime , this term obeys the : @xmath28 with @xmath2 the diffusion constant and @xmath29 a physical quantity that depends on the sample thickness @xmath30 , the transport mean - free path @xmath1 , the absorption length @xmath3 but not on the transverse coordinate @xmath14 [ see link : link[supplement 1 ] ] .",
    "secondly , the coherent contribution , denoted @xmath31 , corresponds to the interference of the wave with its reciprocal counterpart @xcite and is expressed as @xcite : @xmath32 at a given time of flight , the normalized multiple scattering intensity is thus given by : @xmath33}\\ ] ] in our configuration , the spatial distribution of the intensity at a given time has the following shape [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](g ) ] : a narrow , steep peak ( the coherent contribution ) , on top of a wider pedestal that widens with time ( the incoherent contribution ) .",
    "it is worth noting that due to the normalization process , the multiple scattering intensity profile does not depend on the absorption or the thickness of the sample . by fitting this intensity profile at each time of flight with two gaussian curves",
    ", one can separate the coherent and incoherent contributions [ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](g ) ] .",
    "the width @xmath34 of the incoherent background directly accounts for the spatial extent of the diffusive halo .",
    "figure  [ fig2](d ) displays the evolution of @xmath35 versus time . from eq.[eq7 ] , we see that the slope of @xmath35 versus time should be equal to @xmath36 .",
    "the linear fit of @xmath35 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) allows to measure the diffusion constant in the @xmath18 scattering sample : we find @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "an estimation of the transport mean - free path @xmath1 is also possible using the relation @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the energy velocity .",
    "the size of the nanoparticles being small compared to the wavelength and the medium being diluted , we can consider the energy velocity @xmath40 to be close to the vacuum light velocity @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "thus , we obtain the following qualitative estimation for the transport mean free path : @xmath42 @xmath9 m .    the access to transport parameters from the correlation of a diffuse wave - field is a precious information for the optical characterization of a scattering layer .",
    "however , this measurement is averaged over the whole field - of - view ( fov ) and does not provide any local information on disorder .",
    "this issue is tackled in the next subsection .          until now",
    ", the disorder was statistically homogeneous in the scattering sample under study .",
    "we now investigate the case of a medium with a space - dependent concentration of scatterers .",
    "for this purpose we have synthesized a heterogeneously disordered layer of zno nanoparticles .",
    "variations in the concentration of scatterers are visible at a scale smaller than 100 @xmath9 m in the microscopic image [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) ] .",
    "cross - correlations of the diffuse wave - field are recorded using the procedure described in sec .  2 . .",
    "the spatial extent @xmath34 of the diffusive halo is estimated at each time of flight by fitting the normalized multiple scattering intensity profile [ eq .  [ eq7 ] ] with two gaussian curves .",
    "first , the mean intensity is averaged over all the active pixels of the ccd .",
    "a linear fit of @xmath35 versus time [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] allows an estimation of the diffusion constant average over a fov of 5 @xmath43 : @xmath44 @xmath38 .",
    "the fov being at least one order of magnitude larger than the typical scale at which the concentration of scatterers fluctuates , such a measurement does not provide a satisfying characterization of the disorder in the scattering sample .    to cope with this issue , a local approach is needed . instead of considering the mean intensity over the whole sample surface",
    ", one can average the intensity over sub - areas of the ccd camera .",
    "for instance , one can consider sub - areas delineated with red and blue squares in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) that display low and high concentration of scatterers , respectively .",
    "the corresponding diffusive halos show a contrasted speed of expansion [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "quantitatively , a different diffusion constant is measured in both areas .",
    "we find @xmath45 in the blue area and @xmath46 in the red area .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that a higher concentration of scatterers implies a smaller diffusion constant .",
    "@xmath2 is actually proportional to the transport mean free path @xmath1 which itself scales as the inverse of the concentration of scatterers @xcite .",
    "hence , the diffusion contrast highlighted by fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) indicates that the blue area is twice and half more concentrated than the red one .",
    "a further development is to build an image of the medium from local measurements of the diffusion constant .",
    "this is done by considering the mean intensity over sliding windows of @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "the spatial extent @xmath35 of the diffusive halo is fitted linearly over time and yields an estimation of the diffusion constant at the center of each window .",
    "the map of the diffusion constant is superimposed to the reflectivity image of the scattering medium in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .",
    "a qualitative agreement is found between the two images since the diffusion constant is larger in areas where the concentration in scatterers is lower .",
    "however , both images bring different information since the microscope image is only related to the concentration of scatterers at the surface of the medium whereas the diffusion constant also depends on the nature of disorder below the surface .",
    "a 3d image could thus be built from a passive green s functions retrieval but it would require inversion schemes like in optical diffuse tomography @xcite .          until now , we have only considered the case of isotropic scattering media . however , many complex samples such as biological tissues @xcite , nematic crystals @xcite , porous materials @xcite or fibrous media @xcite give rise to anisotropic light diffusion . in such media , the scalar diffusion constant",
    "should be replaced by a diffusion tensor [ see link : link[supplement 1 ] ] . providing that the principal directions of anisotropy are aligned with the cartesian coordinates , this tensor is diagonal @xcite .",
    "the three non zero coefficient @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspond to the diffusion constant along the directions @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . to illustrate the ability of our approach in measuring different components of the diffusion tensor",
    ", we now investigate light diffusion in a piece of thread seal tape ( polytetrafluoroethylene ) which is made of fibers aligned along the x - direction [ see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "strong forward scattering arises along the normal to the fibers direction .",
    "hence , light diffusion is supposed to be slower along the fibers : @xmath55 . to check that hypothesis , the experimental procedure described in sec .",
    "2 is performed .",
    "the measured green s matrix allows to investigate the spatio - temporal evolution of the mean intensity [ eq .  [ eq1 ] ] averaged over the whole fov .",
    "[ fig3 ] displays the diffusive halo in the @xmath56 plane at different times of flight .",
    "the intensity distribution clearly presents an elongated shape along the @xmath57direction .",
    "as expected , light diffusion is thus slower along the @xmath58direction .",
    "this confirms the anisotropy of the sample and the ability of our approach to reveal it .    in supplement 1",
    ", the growth of the diffusive halo is quantitatively investigated both in the @xmath58 and @xmath57directions .",
    "the components of the diffusion tensor are estimated following the procedure described in sec .  3a .",
    "we find @xmath59 @xmath38 and @xmath60 @xmath38 .",
    "an anisotropy factor @xmath61 can be deduced from the measurement of the diffusion tensor in the @xmath56 plane @xcite , such that @xmath62 .",
    "the anisotropy of diffusion is thus successfully quantified by our approach .",
    "the first point we would like to emphasize is the potential impact of our approach in optical diffuse tomography .",
    "a passive measurement of the green s matrix can also enable a great leap forward in fundamental physics .",
    "in this work , we have shown , for instance , how the anisotropy of light diffusion can be revealed and quantified .",
    "a further step would be to investigate exotic transport phenomena such as super- and sub - diffusion of light @xcite or , more ambitiously , to provide a direct proof for anderson localization @xcite .",
    "past experimental studies of anderson localization in optics have been ambiguous , due either to absorption effects @xcite or fluorescence issues @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "our approach would remove any possible ambiguity .",
    "space- and time - dependent experiments can enable absorption - independent observations of localization @xcite .",
    "moreover , a white light illumination in a backscattering configuration limits the incident power required for a satisfactory signal - to - noise ratio , contrary to a transmission configuration that implies a much less energetic signal through a thick scattering layer ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "our experimental scheme would thus prevent from fluorescence or non - linear phenomena @xcite .",
    "it also allows to investigate phenomena like coherent backscattering @xcite or recurrent scattering @xcite that constitute relevant observables at the onset of anderson localization",
    "in summary , we have proposed a novel approach to investigate light transport through complex media .",
    "inspired by previous studies in ultrasound and seismology , we have shown how a set of time - dependent green s functions can be passively extracted between every point at the surface of a scattering medium placed under white light illumination .",
    "the experimental access to this green s matrix is essential since it contains all the information about the complex trajectories of light within the medium . adopting a probabilistic and local approach",
    ", one can , for instance , investigate the spatio - temporal expansion of the diffusive halo in different parts of the sample .",
    "on the one hand , this allows a two - dimensional imaging of the diffusion constant at the surface of the scattering medium , with a spatial resolution of the order of few transport mean free paths . on the other hand ,",
    "our approach is able to reveal and quantify the anisotropy of light diffusion , which can be of great interest for optical characterization purposes .",

    "this document provides supplementary information on the convergence of the time derivative of the mutual coherence function towards the green s functions , the measurement of the diffusion constant components in isotropic and anisotropic scattering media and its comparison with a time - of - flight experiment .",
    "the passive measurement of the green s function is based on the fundamental property that the time derivative of the correlation function should converge for infinite integration times towards the difference between the causal and anti - causal green s functions [ see eq.1 of the accompanying paper ] . in practice , this integration time remains fixed to @xmath65 ms in the experiments shown in the accompanying paper .",

    "it yields @xmath70 the coherence properties of the noise @xmath69 allows to simplify the last equation into @xmath71 not surprisingly , the noise intensity should decrease as the inverse of the integration time @xmath67 .",
    "fig.[convergence ] confirms this behavior by showing the spatially averaged intensity of @xmath72 measured in the tio@xmath73 layer as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "layer*. the spatially averaged intensity of the mutiual coherence functoin , @xmath74 , is plotted as a function of the integration time @xmath67 at different opds .",
    "the continous black line shows for comparison the expected noise intensity decrease as @xmath75 ( see eq.[conv3]).,width=302 ]    for short time delays ( @xmath76 @xmath9 m in fig.[convergence ] ) , the signal intensity is sufficiently large to make the convergence of @xmath77 nearly immediate . for intermediate time delays ( @xmath78 @xmath9 m in fig.[convergence ] ) , @xmath74 decreases as @xmath75 for small integration times before saturating at the signal level for large integration times .",
    "this means that the integration time @xmath65 ms is enough to get rid of most of the noise background and have a satisfying estimation of the green s function . on the contrary , for larger time delays ( @xmath79 @xmath9 m in fig.[convergence ] ) , the signal intensity is too weak to emerge from the noise background : @xmath74 decreases as @xmath75 over the whole integration time range , which is characteristic of a predominant noise background . the value of @xmath74 at time @xmath65 ms allows to determine the noise level in our experiment .",
    "a snr can be derived for each opd : snr@xmath80 at @xmath81 @xmath9 m , snr@xmath82 at @xmath83 @xmath9 m and snr@xmath84 at @xmath85 @xmath9 m .",
    "note that this noise background is systematically subtracted from the raw mean intensity prior to investigating the growth of the diffusive halo in each experiment .",
    "in this section we investigate the case of the propagation of light in the multiple scattering regime .",
    "as mentioned in the article , the energy density @xmath34 whose flux corresponds to the incoherent intensity obeys the diffusion equation : @xmath86 with @xmath87 a source function ,",
    "@xmath3 the absorption mean free path and @xmath2 the diffusion constant .",
    "the solution of this equation corresponds to a diffusive halo whose spatial extent broadens with time [ see fig .",
    "its mathematical expression also depends on the boundary conditions . in the accompanying paper , the samples under study consist in strongly scattering layers of thickness @xmath88 80 @xmath9 m .",
    "the characteristic time for the diffusive wave - field to travel through the scattering medium is given by the thouless time @xmath89 ps for @xmath37 @xmath90 . as the temporal range investigated in our study is of the order of 500 fs , the scattering medium can thus be considered as semi - infinite .        in these conditions , _ patterson et al . _",
    "@xcite established the expression for the backscattered incoherent intensity : @xmath91 with @xmath92 the extrapolation length @xcite and @xmath93 the source - receiver distance .",
    "the incoherent intensity can thus be written as the product of two terms : @xmath94 with : @xmath95 the first term @xmath29 accounts for the temporal decreasing of the incoherent intensity whereas the second term in @xmath96 accounts for the temporal growth of the diffusive halo . by normalizing the incoherent intensity at each time flight",
