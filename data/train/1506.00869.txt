    "our first finding in the ldos curves is a strong peak at zero energy , even for semiconductor ribbons , the so - called mid - gap state .",

    "although the sharp states are also present in the ldos curves , the d1 and d2 configurations do not conduce because the c - h bonds in each doped region are balanced in both graphene sublattices ( see fig .",
