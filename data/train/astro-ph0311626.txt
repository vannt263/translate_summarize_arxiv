    "in this work we examine the expected number counts with different values for the density parameter and compare them to observed counts .",
    "the first model is the best flat model fitting the local temperature distribution function ( tdf ) as well as the high redshift tdf ( henry , 1997 ) , see blanchard 2000 . while the second model is a flat low density model normalized to the local tdf .",
    "as a first step , models are normalized using the local temperature distribution function , two fundamental ingredients are needed : the mass function and the mass - temperature relation , @xmath4 .",
    "here we use the expression of the mass function given by sheth , mo and tormen,1999 .",
    "+ in this work we use different models of universe , including different @xmath4 normalizations , presented in table 1 . + a key - ingredient of the modelling",
    "is the @xmath11 relation and its evolution .",
    "the goal of the xmm - omega project was to measure accurately this relation at redshift about 0.5 ( bartlett et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "we estimate the evolution from the recent xmm observations of high redshift clusters ( lumb et al .",
    ", in prepartion ) , following the method of sadat et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , by computing for each cluster :              , consistent with the chandra result ( vikhlinin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "+ in order to compute number counts , one can notice that the observations actually provide @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( rather than the actual @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , therefore one has to compute the following :      results are presented in figure 1 .",
    "we conclude that _ within the standard scenario of structure formation _ , the predicted abundance of galaxy clusters points toward a high density universe , insensitively to local @xmath0 used , to the dispersion on its evolution nor the different @xmath20 normalization ."
