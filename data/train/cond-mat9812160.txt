    "the transport properties in hybrid structures between ferromagnets and superconductors have received considerable theoretical and experimental attentions .",
    "interest in such structures includes spin - dependent spectroscopy of superconductors and possible device applications .",
    "since the cooper pairs in spin singlet superconductors are formed between up and down spins , the high density of spin injection through a tunneling barrier induces a spin imbalance .",
    "this non - equilibrium state is expected to result in a suppression of the critical temperature and the critical current density in the superconductor .",
    "a large number of experimental studies on spin - polarized tunneling have already been performed using conventional metal superconductors such as al and nb about 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "however , the recent discovery of so - called colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) in mn oxides compound has aroused new interest in this field @xcite , because hybrid structure fabrication of the spin - polarized ferromagnets with high-@xmath2 superconductors is now possible using these materials @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the properties of ferromagnet / insulator / superconductor ( f / i / s ) and ferromagnet / ferromagnetic - insulator / superconductor ( f / fi / s ) junctions have been analyzed based on the assumption that the conductance spectra correspond to the density of states ( dos ) of the superconductor weighted by the spin polarization @xcite . a theory for f",

    "in contrast to @xmath3-wave superconductor cases , at the interface of a @xmath4-wave superconductor , zero - energy states ( zes ) are formed due to the interference effect of the internal phase of the pair potential @xcite .",
    "tunneling theory for @xmath4-wave superconductors has already been presented by extending the btk formula @xcite to include the anisotropy of the pair potential @xcite .",
    "the theory predicts the existence of zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) which reflects the formation of the surface bound states on the @xmath0-wave superconductors . in this paper ,",
    "an exchange interaction is introduced on the normal side of the junction and on the insulator in order to analyze the spin polarized tunneling effects .",
    "the bound - state condition and tunneling spectroscopy of ferromagnet/@xmath0-wave superconductor junctions have already been analyzed in two papers @xcite .",
    "they have revealed several important features in charge transport .",
    "here we will argue that the properties of the andreev reflection @xcite is largely modified due to the presence of the exchange interaction .",
    "in particular , the existence of an evanescent type of the andreev reflection , which is referred to as virtual andreev reflection ( var ) , is explained for the first time ( see ref .",
    "this process has significant roles on the transports especially for junctions between half - metallic ferromagnets and superconductors .",
    "the conductance formulas for the charge and the spin currents are presented based on the scattering method by fully taking account of the var process .",
    "the merit of a formula based on the scattering methods is that the conductance spectra can easily be calculated for arbitrary barrier heights cases without the restriction of the high - barrier limit .",
    "the spin current is , we believe , the most important physical quantity in spin injection devices based on the following two reasons : one is that the spin current gives a direct criteria to estimate the effect of the spin imbalance induced by the tunneling current , the other is that the charge and the spin conductivity may illuminate the study of electron systems that undergo spin - charge separation , such as tomonaga - luttinger liquids and possibly underdoped high-@xmath2 superconductors @xcite",
    ". we will also analyze ferromagnetic insulator effects , which includes the spin - filtering effect @xcite , due to the presence of an exchange field in the insulator .",
    "it is shown that a spin - dependent energy shift during the tunneling process induces a splitting of the zbcp .",
    "based on the detailed analysis of the conductance spectra , we propose a simple method to distinguish the broken time - reversal symmetry ( btrs ) states inducement at the surface @xcite from spin - dependent tunneling effects .",

    "the most important differences in the present formula from previous ones are ; i ) a novel formula for the non - linear spin current ,",

    "then @xmath75 converges to the surface dos weighted by the tunneling probability distribution @xcite . at this limit",
    ", we can reproduce a well - known result that the ratio of the peak heights in the spin - resolved spectra directly reflect the polarization in the ferromagnet @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath107}(e , \\theta)$ ] reduces to a function similar to the surface dos , but where the divergence at the energy levels of the surface bound states is missing .",
    "next , the calculated results based on above formula are presented for @xmath4-wave superconductors . in the following ,",
    "we assume @xmath108 . figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] show the conductance spectra of charge current for the transparent limit ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) and high - barrier case ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) as the function of exchange interaction @xmath113 . for @xmath114 , results in ref .",

    "it is clear that the zbcp is not present for the spin current .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the charge current components corresponding to the zes are carried by condensed cooper pairs in the superconductor , and therefore they do not contribute to the spin imbalance . as a result , the spin current becomes relatively insensitive to the orientation of the junctions .",

    "the large deviations of @xmath4-wave from @xmath3-wave for small values of @xmath121 are originated from the distribution of the pair amplitude in @xmath46-space .",
    "as the barrier parameter becomes larger , the spin injection efficiency becomes to be insensitive to the symmetry of the pair potential .",
    "it has been experimentally verified that a ferromagnetic semiconductor used as the insulator in tunneling junctions works as a ferromagnetic barrier .",
    "since the transmission probabilities for up and down spins are not equal , an spin - filtering effect is expected to be realized @xcite .",
    "also it has been theoretically verified that a ferromagnetic insulator placed in the vicinity of superconductor induces a spin - splitting on the dos of @xmath3-wave superconductors @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we will analyze the influence of the exchange interaction existing inside the insulator on the transport properties based on the formulation described in sec .",

    "zbcp splittings are obtained for finite exchange amplitude ( @xmath123 ) cases . as @xmath123",
    "is increased and consequently as the difference between @xmath124 and @xmath125 becomes larger , the amplitude of the splitting becomes larger and the two peaks become broader and smaller .",
    "the peaks in the gap disappear when the difference between @xmath124 and @xmath125 becomes prominent . to see more clearly these trends , the spin - resolved conductance spectra @xmath84}(e)$ ] and @xmath76 for @xmath126 and @xmath127",

    "the spin polarization in the ferromagnet induces the imbalance of the peak heights , thus the ratio of the splitted peak heights can be used as a criteria for the spin - polarization .",
    "these results are interpreted as follows : i ) the peaks corresponding to the up [ down ] spin components are shifted because of the energy gain ( loss ) during the tunneling process .",
    "ii ) since this energy gain ( loss ) has @xmath46-dependence @xcite , the peak becomes broader comparing to the magnetic - field induced peak splitting ( see below ) .",
    "iii ) the amplitude of the peak splitting depends on the genuine barrier amplitude @xmath128 as well as the exchange amplitude @xmath129 .",
    "for example , the splitted peaks merge into a single peak at the tunneling limit ( @xmath130 ) even if @xmath129 is kept constant .",
    "iv ) the current corresponding to the zbcp is carried by the cooper pair in the superconductor as described in the previous subsection .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the ar process is the second - lowest order tunneling process which requires both up and down spins tunneling .",
    "hence , as @xmath125 becomes larger and as the tunneling probability for down spins are suppressed , the conductance peaks and the ar process are rapidly reduced even if @xmath124 is kept zero .",
    "v ) the spin current is increased as @xmath129 is raised from zero even if @xmath115 in the ferromagnet is kept at zero ( unpolarized ) .",
    "this feature directly corresponds to the spin - filtering effect that the spin - selective tunneling occurs due to the presence of the exchange field in the insulator .",
    "next , various types of the zbcp splitting expected for @xmath0-wave superconductors and their polarization effects are analyzed .",
    "mainly two possibilities other than the ferromagnetic insulator effects have been proposed for the origins of the zbcp splitting on high-@xmath131 superconductor junctions .",
    "one is the zeeman effect due to an applied magnetic field , and the other is the inducement of the btrs states such as @xmath132+@xmath133-wave .",
    "the conductance spectra in an applied magnetic field is calculated from above formula by simply using the relation @xmath134}(e)=\\sigma_{q[s],\\uparrow}(e-\\mu_{b}h)+ \\sigma_{q[s],\\downarrow}(e+\\mu_{b}h),\\ ] ] where @xmath135 is the zeeman energy .",
    "calculated charge conductance spectra for @xmath132-wave superconductor as a function of @xmath115 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the amplitude of the splitting is linear to the applied field independent of the barrier heights .",
    "moreover , since the energy shift induced by the magnetic field does not have @xmath46-dependence , the broadening of the peaks are not observed .",
    "the ratio of the splitted peak heights simply reflects the polarization in the ferromagnet , which is consistent with the results by tedrow and meservey @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath75 for @xmath132+@xmath133-wave superconductor",
    "is calculated by setting @xmath136 .",
    "calculated charge conductance spectra for various @xmath115 values are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "the amplitude of the splitting is almost equivalent to the amplitude of the @xmath3-wave component .",
    "the shape of the spectrum without the polarization ( @xmath114 ) is quite similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ( @xmath114 ) . as @xmath115 becomes larger ,",
    "the heights of the two peaks are reduced , which is consistent with that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . on the other hand , differently from figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , since the peak splitting is not induced by spin - dependent effects in this case , the polarization in the ferromagnets does not yield an imbalance in the peak heights .",
    "thus the heights of the two peaks are reduced symmetrically .",
    "the responses of the zbcp on the variation of the polarization and the applied magnetic field are summarized as follows : i ) the peak splitting due to the ferromagnetic insulator and    the zeeman effect are spin dependent .",
    "therefore , the polarization in the ferromagnet induces the asymmetrical splitting of the zbcp .",
    "ii ) the amplitude of the peak splitting is linear to the applied field in the case of the zeeman effect .",
    "however , it is non - linear in the cases of the ferromagnetic insulator effects @xcite and the btrs states @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the peak splittings are expected even in the absence of the applied field for these two cases .",
    "iii ) the combination of the btrs states and the zeeman effect induces an additional peak splitting , that is , the zbcp splits into four peaks .",
    "however , the combination of the zeeman and the ferromagnetic insulator effects yields two peaks .",
    "the experimental observations of the zbcp splitting have been reported for normal metal / high-@xmath131 superconductor junctions @xcite .",
    "it is a really interesting experiment to observe the same features by using ferromagnets / high-@xmath131 superconductor junctions in order to distinguish the spin - dependent effects from the btrs states inducement .",

    "the qualitative features on the magnetic field responses of their junctions are consistent with f / fi / s with @xmath132-wave explained here",
    ". detailed comparison between above formulas and their experiments is strongly expected .",
    "finally , a simple proposal is given for a possible device application utilizing the ferromagnetic insulator effects .",
    "the thickness of the insulator is the order of 1 nm in usual tunneling junctions .",
    "since the controlling of properties in such a thin layer requires high technology , as far as we know , not so many experimental trials have been accomplished thus far .",
    "however , as shown in this paper , a small change in the insulator property causes a drastic change on the transport properties .",
    "therefore , the controlling of the barrier properties is one of the most promising methods to create new functional devices .",
    "for example , consider a f / fi / s junction with a @xmath132-wave superconductor ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "the sharp zbcp is drastically modified as the difference between @xmath143 and @xmath144 becomes larger as shown in fig .",
    "this means that , for a fixed bias voltage , a large response in current is expected due to a small variation in the exchange interaction in the insulator .",
    "this response is applicable for the high - sensitive magnetization measurement of a thin insulating film by inserting the film into a junction as a tunneling barrier .",
    "if the exchange interaction is sensitive to the external field , this effect can be used as a magnetic sensor . alternatively ,",
    "if the magnetization of the insulator shows a hysteresis on the external field variation , a memory function can be realized .",
    "the current gain of the junction as a function of the external field is largely enhanced by using a superconductor /ferromagnetic insulator /superconductor junction with @xmath0-wave , because negative - conductance regions are expected just beside the zbcp in this configuration @xcite .",
    "differently from conventional superconducting memories based on a flux - quantum logic , a large - scale integration circuit may be possible based on the present principle .",
    "in this paper , the conductance spectra for the charge and the spin currents under the influence of the exchange interaction have been calculated based on the scattering method .",
    "the influence of the spin polarization on the transport properties has been clarified .",
    "it is shown that the retro - reflectivity of the standard andreev reflection process is broken in the presence of an exchange field and that the surface bound states due to superconducting pair potentials do not contribute to the spin current .",
    "next , the ferromagnetic insulator including the spin - filtering effect are analyzed .",
    "it is shown that the spin - polarization gives asymmetric peak splitting . moreover , various features in the splitting of zbcp due to the ferromagnetic insulator , the zeeman splitting , and the btrs states effects are analyzed in detail .",
    "it is shown that the spin - polarized tunneling gives quite important information to identify the origin of the zbcp splitting . by comparing the present analysis with experimental data",
    ", we expect that the mechanism of the peak splitting in high-@xmath131 superconductors will be well identified . in the present model ,",
    "we have neglected the effects of spin - orbit scattering @xcite and the non - equilibrium properties of superconductors @xcite .",
    "inclusion of these effects would be necessary for a complete theory .",
    "the formulation for triplet superconductors will be presented in another publication @xcite .",
