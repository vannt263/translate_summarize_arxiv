    "a canonical neutron star consists mainly of superfluid neutrons , superconducting protons ( with an abundance a few percent that of the neutrons ) and an equal number of relativistic degenerate electrons ( fermi energy@xmath0  mev ) . in the outer kilometer",
    "the protons clump into a lattice of neutron - rich nuclei ( the stellar `` crust '' ) with the neutron superfluid filling the space between .",
    "a spinning neutron star s superfluid neutrons rotate at an angular rate @xmath1 only by establishing an array of quantized vortex lines parallel to the stellar spin axis , with an area density @xmath2 any magnetic field which passes through the star s superconducting protons must become very inhomogeneously structured . in a type ii superconductor , expected to be the case below the crust and perhaps all the way down to the central core , the magnetic field becomes organized into @xmath3 quantized flux tubes per unit area , with @xmath4 the flux in each tube . unlike the quasi - parallel neutron vortex line array , the flux tube array is expected to have a complicated twisted structure following that of the much smoother toroidal plus poloidal magnetic field which existed before the transition into superconductivity ( at about @xmath5  k ) .    a spinning - down ( up ) neutron star s neutron superfluid vortex array must expand ( contract ) . because the core of a neutron vortex and a flux tube interact strongly as they pass through each other , the moving vortices will push on the proton s flux tube array ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , forcing it either ( a ) to move together with the vortices , or ( b ) to be cut through if the flux tube array can not respond fast enough to partake in the vortex motion .",
    "section 2 discusses possible relationships among a pulsar s @xmath1 , @xmath6 , and rate of change of spin ( @xmath7 ) , which discriminate between these two behaviors . in case ( a ) the evolution of the magnetic field at the core - crust interface",
    "is well determined by the initial magnetic field configuration and subsequent changes in stellar @xmath1 . in case",
    "( b ) the core - crust interface field would evolve more slowly relative to changes in @xmath1 , although qualitative features of the evolution should be similar to those of case ( a ) .",
    "some microphysics and observations , considered in sections 2 and 3 , support case ( a ) behavior for pulsars whose spin - down ( or up ) ages , @xmath8 , are not less than those of vela - like radiopulsars ( @xmath9 ) and case ( b ) behavior for the much more rapidly spinning - down crab - like radiopulsars ( @xmath10 )    between the stellar core and the world outside it is a solid crust with a very high electrical conductivity .",
    "if the crust were absolutely rigid and a perfect conductor then its response to changes in the core magnetic field would be limited to rigid crust rotations .",
    "of course neither is the case .",
    "a high density of core flux tubes merges into a smooth field when passing through the crust .",
    "because of the almost rigid crust s high conductivity , it , at least temporarily , freezes in place the capitals of the core s flux tubes .",
    "as these flux tube capitals at the crust - core interface are pushed by a moving core neutron vortex array , a large stress builds up in the crust .",
    "this stress will be relaxed when the crust is stressed beyond its yield strength , or , if the build - up is slow enough , by dissipation of the crustal eddy currents which hold in place the magnetic field as it passes from the core through the crust .",
    "the shear modulus of a crust is well described quantitatively , but not the maximum crust strain before yielding ( and the associated yield strength ) .",
    "rough estimates have suggested a maximum yield strain , @xmath11 , between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xcite ) . nor is it known how the stellar crust moves when its yield strength is exceeded . by plastic flow ( creep ) ? by crumbling ? by cracking ?",
    "the answer is likely to depend on the crust temperature .",
    "a crust s eddy current dissipation time could be anywhere in the range @xmath14 years depending upon how the crust was made .",
    "a young solitary pulsar was probably born with a temperature @xmath15  mev . as it cooled the formation of crust nuclei and their crystallization into a crustal lattice occurred at about the same temperature , @xmath16  mev .",
    "the impurity fraction ( the probability that neighboring nuclei have different proton numbers ) has not been calculated quantitatively and this allows a very wide latitude in the possible range for the `` impurity '' contribution to crustal resistivity .",
    "in addition , the crust of an accreting neutron star spun - up to a period of a few milliseconds in a lmxb has had a very different history from that of a solitary spinning - down radiopulsar .",
    "the lmxb neutron star ultimately accretes more than @xmath17 times the mass of the nuclei in its crustal lattice , mainly as he or h. crust is continually pushed into the core by the loading , and replaced . as the accreted h and",
    "he are buried with growing density a series of nuclear reactions ultimately fuse them into heavier magic number nuclei ( @xmath18 40 , 50 32 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is probably not accomplished without some explosive nuclear burning .",
    "the resulting reformed crust may well have an impurity fraction , electrical conductivity , and crust thickness very different from that of a canonical young solitary radiopulsar .",
    "there seems to be considerable observational , as well as theoretical , support for the hypothesis that the surface magnetic fields of neutron stars slowly spun - up to become millisecond pulsars by accretion in lmxb s do indeed reflect the expected core field evolution at the crust - core interface ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the core field there does appear to have had a case ( a ) history : the core s magnetic flux tubes were moved in to the spin - axis by the contracting neutron superfluid vortex array . here",
    "the spin - up time scales ( @xmath19 years ) are so very long that crustal shielding of core magnetic field changes is expected to be relatively easily defeated .",
    "rough estimates of crust properties ( @xcite ) indicate that , generally , crustal yielding in the younger much more rapidly spinning - down pulsars also causes the surface field of such neutron stars to be strongly correlated with the configuration of the core flux which enters the crust at the core - crust interface .",
    "( see , however , the exception for the very slowly spinning x - ray pulsars . )",
    "stratification in the crust ( because the @xmath20 of the most stable nucleus varies with depth ) allows mainly only two - dimensional crustal movement on surfaces of constant gravitational ( plus centrifugal ) potential . where the surface field is strongest , and crustal stresses from moving crust - anchored core flux greatest",
    ", crustal matter would be expected to move with the core s moving flux , accompanied by the backflow of more weakly magnetized regions of the crust .",
    "below , except for the special case of the very slow x - ray pulsars , we shall simply assume that shielding by the crust of changes in the core flux emerging into it , is , at best , temporary and unimportant even on the spin - down time scales of solitary radiopulsars .    in section 3",
    "we review the expected pulsar magnetic dipole moment evolution caused by neutron star spin - down or spun - up .",
    "it gives young radiopulsar spin - down indices which do not disagree with observations .",
    "these results are not sensitive to details of just how a crust relaxes the growing stresses on it from the moving core magnetic flux tubes below it . in section 4",
    "we consider particular consequences when that relaxation is accomplished by large scale crust cracking events , which cause pulsar timing glitches .",
    "a permanent ( i.e. unhealed ) jump in spin - down rate should remain after almost all glitches .",
    "the calculated glitch spin - period jump magnitude is closely related to it .",
    "both depend upon how much crust stress relaxation is accomplished in each such cracking event .",
    "this can be estimated very roughly at best .",
    "however , the glitch model does lead to predictions for the magnitudes of small glitches in crab - like pulsars and of giant ones in vela - like pulsars , for the intervals between such glitches , for a drop in glitch magnitudes in long period pulsars and maximum pulsar period beyond which large glitches should disappear .",
    "these predictions are not in conflict with glitch observations .",
    "one important consequence of the model is that some parts of the core neutron superfluid can spin - up very slowly after the beginning of a glitch because of the large drag in rapidly moving core vortices embedded in a dense flux tube array . if so the canonical assumption ( @xcite ) of an unobservably tight coupling between all of a core s neutron superfluid and the charged components of the pulsar should be reassessed .",
    "during neutron star spin - down ( e.g. , in a solitary radiopulsar ) or spin - up ( e.g. , by accretion in a low mass x - ray binary ) neutron superfluid vortices a vector distance @xmath21 from the stellar spin - axis move with a radial velocity @xmath22 as a result of this motion a force density ( @xmath23 ) will build up on the flux tube array in which these vortex lines are embedded until the flux tubes move with , or are cut through by , the moving vortices .",
    "the core electron - proton plasma is almost incompressible and its abundance relative to the core neutrons varies with radius . because of the extremely weak conversion rate for the transformations @xmath24 and @xmath25 needed to maintain a large bulk electron - proton sea transport across stellar radii , non - dissipative motions in which the electron - proton plasma and its embedded flux tubes move together are restricted .",
    "we consider below mainly the alternative where flux tubes in response to the force on them from a changing neutron vortex array move through the proton - electron sea with some relative velocity @xmath26 .    magnetic field movement by eddy diffusion in an ordinary conductor",
    "is driven by the self - stress force density of a non - force - free * b*-field configuration : @xmath27 this * f * forces flux to move through the conductor with a characteristic velocity @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the electrical conductivity of the medium . here",
    "the force density @xmath23 is mainly a consequence of large scale inhomogeneity in the field distribution , @xmath30 the time for @xmath31 to be pushed out of a stationary stellar core of radius r would then be the usual eddy diffusion time @xmath32 the resistivity @xmath33 in a non - superconducting degenerate electron - proton sea is dominated by electron - phonon scattering ( @xcite ) : @xmath34 with t the temperature and @xmath35 the proton density . from the resistivity of equation  [ sig1 ] with plausible neutron star parameter and the @xmath23 of equation  [ force ] with @xmath36 , @xmath37 greatly exceeds @xmath38years .",
    "the @xmath39 of equation  [ vph ] would then be too small to be of interest for observable flux changes in a spinning - down ( or up ) neutron star .",
    "however , when the proton sea becomes superconducting , the @xmath39 of equation  [ vph ] can become very much greater .",
    "this is because of the sub - microscopic bunching of @xmath31 into the huge density of quantized flux tubes .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , a randomized electron scattering comes not only from collisions with phonons , but also from collisions with the flux tubes themselves .",
    "the latter contributes a much larger resistivity than that of equation  [ sig1 ] .",
    "second , the contribution to the force @xmath23 that drives the flux tube motion which is caused by the push of moving superfluid neutron vortex - lines on flux tubes can very greatly exceed that of equation  [ force ] , the self - stress calculated from the large scale variation of a classically smooth field .",
    "flux tube motion in response to some @xmath23 is possible only if the necessary energy dissipation accompanying it equals the work done by @xmath23 , then @xmath40 where the locally average @xmath41 .",
    "the first term on the rhs is the dissipation from the current flow caused by the simultaneous motion of very many flux tubes ( it has typically been neglected in the literature .",
    "its importance was emphasized by p. goldreich ( 1993 ) . ) . in writing equation  [ diss ]",
    "we make the implicit assumption that the original array of flux tubes moves but no new flux loops are created or existing ones reconnected and destroyed . they may not be valid except in the limit of very small @xmath39 .",
    "the conductivity @xmath42 is that for ( electron ) current flow in the @xmath43 direction , i.e. perpendicular to @xmath31 . for a given @xmath31 this contribution to dissipation",
    "is not sensitive to details of flux tube radii or the magnitude @xmath44 except through the dependence of @xmath29 upon both of them .",
    "the second term on the rhs is from the direct drag force ( along @xmath45 ) on individual flux tubes pushing through the electron sea . the drag coefficient ( force per unit length of flux tube @xmath46 ) on an isolated solitary flux tube ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath47 with @xmath48 the electron sea fermi energy and @xmath49 the radius of a flux tube ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "[ @xmath51 with @xmath52 the effective proton mass and @xmath35 the proton plasma density . ]",
    "the electron resistivity , @xmath33 , now has two contributions .",
    "one is the contribution from electron - phonon scattering of equation  [ sig1 ] ; the other is from scattering of electrons on the flux tubes themselves .",
    "because the magnetic flux is bundled into intensely magnetized flux tubes at each of which electrons are scattered through a finite angle ( @xmath53 ) , there is a drag along the electron velocity proportional to @xmath54 at each scattering .",
    "( equivalently the circular trajectory of an electron in a `` uniform '' * b * is replaced by a polygon with a random scattering component @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] at each vertex . ) because the separation between scatters ( @xmath56 ) is very large compared to @xmath57 , there is negligible interference between scattering at different vertices . ) the drag along the electron velocity is just that from equation  [ drag ] .",
    "it contributes a resistivity @xmath58 with @xmath59 the number density of electrons .",
    "the contribution of equation  [ sig2 ] to @xmath60 is generally much more important than that of equation  [ sig1 ] .",
    "( for typical neutron star parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 s while @xmath64 . )",
    "if we neglect it we can approximate a very small flux tube velocity in the direction of a @xmath23 perpendicular to @xmath31 by the exact analogue of equation  [ vph ] @xmath65 with an effective conductivity @xmath66 we note that @xmath67 when @xmath68 because of infinite electron conductivity , and also when @xmath69 because of the infinite drag on a solitary moving ( with respect to the e - p sea ) flux tube .",
    "the contribution of the second term on the rhs of equation  [ cond ] to @xmath42 is generally negligible in typical pulsars .    to evaluate the maximum @xmath70 before the cutting through of a flux tube array by a moving vortex array",
    "we must now consider the maximum @xmath23 just before cutting through begins .",
    "from appendix a , this is , roughly , @xmath71 with @xmath72 the vortex area density of equation  [ nph ] , @xmath73 the magnetic field within a flux tube , @xmath74 the magnetic field within a vortex line , and @xmath75 the bcs correlation length of the cooper pairs in the superconducting proton sea .",
    "[ the force density of equation  [ fmax ] greatly exceeds that from flux line curvature ( @xcite ) or flux tube buoyancy ( @xcite ) . ] from equations  [ vphi ] , [ cond ] , and [ fmax ] the maximum velocity ( @xmath76 ) with which a moving vortex array can push a flux tube array through the electron - proton sea in which it is embedded would be @xmath77 i.e. @xmath76 is proportional to the ratio of vortex line density to flux tube density .",
    "the proportionality constant , @xmath78 , is independent of @xmath79 and @xmath6 but does depend upon properties of neutron star matter below the crust : @xmath80    the constant @xmath78 depends upon imprecise estimates of the vortex flux - tube interaction , the flux - tube spacing along moving vortex lines , the angle between local @xmath31 and @xmath81 , etc .",
    "however the main problem with applying equations  [ vcr ] and [ bet ] to flux tube motion may be the implicit assumption that @xmath45 is so small that @xmath82 ( and thus local @xmath31 ) in it is qualitatively unaffected by the electric currents induced by the flux tube motion , i.e. that the effect of @xmath23 is only to move the preexisting flux tubes which remain locally straight and uniformly distributed .",
    "further , the geometrical distribution and motion of flux tubes may , in reality , be quite complicated with flux tubes , the electron - proton seas , and neutron vortex lines moving together without cutting - through in many regions and with vortices cutting through flux tubes in others .",
    "we emphasize that for two dimensional motions of the electron - proton sea in the spherical layer just below the crust ( the only core layer which directly affects the surface field ) stratification does not restrict flux tube crowns in the most magnetized regions from being moved by vortex push from initial positions near the spin - axis all the way down to the equator during spin - down .",
    "we shall , therefore , consider equation  [ vcr ] as a phenomenological one for the behavior of magnetic flux tubes in the stellar core layer just below the crust - core interface with @xmath6 the pulsar dipole field strength inferred from spin - down .",
    "we take @xmath83 , about the value expected from equation  [ bet ] , but even more because equation  [ vcr ] then leads to a good description of various observed properties of young spinning - down radiopulsars .",
    "the velocity @xmath84 as a function of @xmath85 and @xmath76 of equation  [ vcr ] with @xmath86 is sketched in figure 1 for a vela - like pulsar with @xmath87 , and @xmath88 g. for @xmath89 the neutron superfluid vortex expansion velocity ( proportional to @xmath85 ) is slow enough to carry all flux tubes with the expanding vortex array , at least in the core layer just below the crust ; flux tube cut through occurs for @xmath90 . from equations",
    "[ vor ] and [ vcr ] @xmath91 with @xmath92 the pulsar spin - down time scale ( age ) . then for @xmath93 , i.e. for vela - like pulsars and those much older , @xmath94 , i.e @xmath95 the stellar radius r and all flux would move out with the @xmath96 of the vortex array . for crab - like",
    "pulsars with @xmath92 an order of magnitude smaller than that for the vela pulsar most of the flux array ( except that within @xmath97 of the spin - axis ) would move out much more slowly than the neutron vortices .",
    "as indicated in figure 1 , however , it is not yet known how fast that cut - through flux tube outward flow should be .",
    "based upon the above assumptions and estimates about the interaction between a pulsar core s arrays of superfluid neutron vortices and superconducting proton flux tubes , we consider below consequences of a greatly simplified model for the evolution of magnetic fields in spinning - down pulsars :    1 .",
    "the crust and core magnetic fields will be described as if they were axially symmetric around the spin axis ( clearly in contradiction to what is required for a pulsar s rotating radio beams ) .",
    "the important consequence is that core flux tubes can then move outward only by pushing through the core s electron - proton sea , even if their actual motion is more complicated ( and might not involve such push through in many regions ) .",
    "2 .   when @xmath98 of equation  [ r_cr ] with @xmath99 , flux tubes move outward with the velocity @xmath96 of equation  [ vor ] .",
    "3 .   when @xmath100 flux tubes are moved outward with the smaller velocity @xmath76 of equation  [ vcr ] .",
    "for example in the vela pulsar @xmath101 for almost all flux tubes , but in the crab pulsar most flux tubes would not keep up with the core s neutron vortices . rather , @xmath102 4 .",
    "the surface fields of the neutron star reflect those of the core at the core - crust interface .",
    "( this , probably , would not be accomplished for exact axial symmetry . in a more realistic model",
    "it would be expected only for the most strongly magnetized regions since some crustal backflow ( where @xmath6 is weakest ) would be expected to allow the strongly forced crust movement where @xmath6 is largest . )    we consider next a comparison of the predictions of such a model to observations of @xmath103 , and p for some of the younger pulsars .",
    "in this model the core and surface magnetic field configurations of a neutron star depend not only on the star s spin history , but also on its ( quite unknown ) initial field configuration .",
    "it is often convenient in calculations to assume the surface field to be that of a central dipole but there are no physical arguments supporting this special configuration as there is , for example , for the earth s surface field where the surface is very far from the core dynamo currents .",
    "more plausible might be some ( random ) mixture of higher moments ( @xcite ) , or a strongly off - center dipole from a toroidal field ( originally amplified by initial differential rotation ) which has pushed out through the stellar surface in some region .",
    "an initial `` sunspot - like '' surface field configuration seems needed to describe the evolution of some neutron stars which are spun - up to become very fast millisecond pulsars ( @xcite ) : most of the magnetic flux from each of these stars spin - hemispheres returns to the star in the same hemisphere as that from which it originates .    with an axially symmetric magnetic field configuration the spin - down rate of a solitary neutron star depends almost entirely on its net dipole moment @xmath104 which can vary and its moment of inertia .",
    "the expected evolution of such a dipole moment is shown in figure 2 together with inferred moments ( from observed spin - down rates ) of radiopulsars .",
    "three common evolutionary stages are predicted for all pulsars :    stage a - b ) : :    in young crab - like pulsars , @xmath105 is much smaller than the    @xmath106 cm stellar radius . in most of the core    @xmath107 .",

    "however a subsequent    calculation ( @xcite ) which took account of the nuclear interaction    between protons and neutrons gave a much smaller gap energy    ( @xmath267 ) .",
    "it is then somewhat less    clear whether the core protons form a type ii or a type i    superconductor . for a stiff equation of state part of the core protons    may well form a type i superconductor , while for a soft equation of    state it is probable that only the type ii superconductor exists in    the core protons of a neutron star .",
    "evidence supporting an    intermediately stiff or a stiff equation of state ( @xcite ) suggests    protons might indeed form a type i superconductor in part of the core .    there",
    ", magnetic field would be in a mixed state in which b becomes    large enough ( @xmath268 ) to quench    superconductivity in some small slab - like regions , and essentially    vanishes in between them .",
    "the typical size of such field - free regions    is about @xmath269 with    @xmath270 the assumed scale size of the type i    superconducting region .",
    "the type i region can also influence flux    tubes in type ii region to bunch together on a similar 1 cm scale .",

    "there are plausible    mechanisms for the generation of @xmath272 clouds all around    the near environment of the pulsar .",
    "because of the huge    @xmath273 cyclotron resonant scattering of x - ray photons    of energy @xmath274 , an energy which extends from    20kev to 20 ev within 10 stellar radii , this @xmath272    atmosphere would be optically thick to thermal x - rays for plausible    @xmath272 densities ( @xcite ) .",

    "* a ) * would appear most likely to be important , i.e. a fundamental inadequacy of the idealized model for core flux tube motion ( especially in layers not adjacent to the crust core interface ) .",
    "the time scale ( @xmath275 ) for a suddenly spun - up crust , in a glitch , sharing its tiny angular momentum jump with the core s much heavier superfluid neutrons is usually taken to be unobservably short ( @xcite ) . because it is not resolved in vela pulsar this time scale",
    "is presumed to be less than @xmath276 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the value estimated from our proposed model or any model which involves flux - tube drag or cutting - through can give a very different result .",
    "because of the drag on the @xmath277 flux tubes that must be carried inward or cut through by each of vela s core vortex lines to accomplish a small rapid increase in core neutron angular rotation speed , the response of these superfluid neutrons may be very sluggish .    for vela s",
    "core s superfluid neutrons very quickly to share in the angular momentum given up by crustal superfluid neutrons in a glitch , the core neutrons vortices must move inward about 1 cm in less than @xmath17s . before this occurs",
    "the core vortex array first increases its rotational speed in response to the sudden spin - up of the core s flux tubes with which these vortices interact .",
    "this causes an incremental inward push ( magnus force ) on the core neutron vortices .",
    "this force density @xmath278 where @xmath279 is the initial ( unresolved ) giant glitch spin - up before there is any transfer of angular momentum to core superfluid neutrons . if the subsequent inward vortex motion involves pushing flux tubes through the electron proton sea , equation  [ vphi ] gives a maximum inward flux tube speed @xmath280 to move inward by 1 cm would then take @xmath281 where flux tube cut - through by moving vortices occurs first the time scale @xmath282 for @xmath283 ( @xcite ) .",
    "almost all of the possibilities in section 5.1 for reducing @xmath263 would also reduce @xmath275 , but for some , or perhaps all , core neutrons the needed reduction seems so large that it is hard to see how @xmath275 can become unobservably short for all of the core neutron superfluid .",
    "one possibility for resolving this problem may be to accept the model result that where vortices must push flux tubes through the electron - proton sea or cut through them , @xmath275 is unresolved because it is too long , i.e. far longer than the interval between glitches ( @xmath169 ) . with the possible resolution suggested in section 5.1a ) , those vortex lines whose surrounding flux tubes move with their embedding e - p sea may quickly adjust ( @xmath284 ) and also generate little @xmath263 , while only a very small minority of vortex lines with the flux tubes they carry actually move through their local charged sea .",
    "if this is the case , although the @xmath177 of equation  ( [ gact ] ) would not include all core superfluid neutrons , it still might be nearly the entire i of the star",
    ". this would also be the case if the core is mainly a k - condensate or quark matter , superconductors with no purely neutral superfluids to be spun - up in a glitch .",
    "( the charged ones are easily spun - up by any magnetic field which couples them to the crust . )",
    "it should be noted that a large reduction of @xmath275 for some parts of the core neutron superfluid could put the time scale in the range where it should contribute to glitch `` healing '' analyses .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank a. alpar , k.s cheng , p. goldreich , f. graham - smith , a. lyne , and d. pines for informative conversations .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grants nag 5 - 2016 .",
    "because magnetic field inside neutron stars are usually not aligned along the spin axis when neutron stars spin - down ( -up ) the outward ( inward ) moving superfluid neutron vortices run into proton flux tubes .",
    "the interaction between superfluid neutron vortices and proton superconductor magnetic flux tubes as they try to cross through each other can thus play an important part in determining the motion of both vortices and flux tubes .",

    "( 1990 ) proposed that the proton density perturbation in the center of a flux tube would give rise to an interaction energy per intersection @xmath285 where @xmath286 are the neutron , proton bcs correlation lengths , @xmath287 are the respective gap energies , @xmath288 the fermi energies and @xmath289 the neutron number density .",
    "an even more important contribution to the interaction energy comes from the magnetic interaction between neutron vortex lines and proton flux tubes and from the velocity dependence of the nuclear interaction between the neutrons in a vortex and the protons in a flux tube , which is also the ultimate cause of the neutron vortex line flux .",
    "both can be taken into account using an effective ginzburg - laudau ( gl ) free energy ( @xmath290 ) for an interacting mixture of superfluid neutrons and superconducting neutrons ( @xcite ) @xmath291 where @xmath292 is the condensation energy density , @xmath293 and @xmath294 are the `` bare '' densities of superconducting protons and superfluid neutrons respectively , @xmath295 is the coupling density , and @xmath296 and @xmath297 are the superfluid velocities defined by @xmath298 the superfluid electric current is @xmath299\\ .",

    "we assume that just before cutting through the typical distance between two consecutive flux tubes pushed by the same moving vortex is about @xmath49 , i.e. flux tubes are swept up by a moving vortex but not cut through .",
    "the magnetic repulsion between flux tubes limits their density .",
    "this repulsion is not effective until the inter - flux tube separation approaches @xmath49 .",
