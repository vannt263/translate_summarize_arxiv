    "it must be noted that this kind of experiments on friction dynamics are usually modelled using the so - called rate - and - state equations @xcite , which incorporate the fact that the friction force does not simply depend on the relative velocity between the two nominal surfaces but also depends on the history of the contact , via a macroscopic `` state '' variable @xmath16 . in our model",

    "the random force @xmath25 mimics the contacts between the asperities of the block and those of the surface , and acts as a microscopic static friction force .",
    "when a contact is broken , two things happen : ( i ) the block moves and redistributes stress to neighbouring blocks , ( ii ) the asperities involved in the junction are renewed , as sketched in fig .",

    "velocity weakening is a direct consequence of the viscoelastic relaxation .",
    "in fact , the model without viscoelasticity lacks any velocity dependence of the friction force , as in that case there is no internal time scale to compete with the driving time scale .",
    "it should be noted that the most commonly observed velocity - weakening friction law is only logarithmic in @xmath0 , but can not be expected here because we introduced a single relaxation time scale , in a mean field model .",
    "this echoes the results found in @xcite , where a @xmath62 velocity weakening law is found to occur in a non interacting block model with random friction coefficients , where the relaxation time scale is present thanks to the non - instantaneous slips .",
    "one may also note that we do not expect any of the velocity - strengthening scenarios ( as those proposed in @xcite ) to occur either , since we do not account for any of the faster mechanisms that become relevant under fast driving .",

    "[ fig : sigmavst ] , the evolution of the stress over time is compared for three values of the velocity : at slow driving velocities the stress @xmath67 oscillates periodically with an amplitude denoted @xmath68 , while at fast driving a stationary value is reached ( i.e.  @xmath69 ) .",
    "note that the amplitude @xmath70 of the oscillations is also the width of the stress drops or `` gaps '' that occur during the system - size events .",
    "this behavior points to a bifurcation of the dynamics as velocity is reduced . to study this effect",

    "this @xmath74 dependence at low @xmath5 comes directly from the uniform increase of the pulling force as @xmath75 and implies that for any non zero values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 , there will always be a value of @xmath5 below which some stick - slip dynamics occurs , even at very large velocities .    in the stationary regime ,",

    "fig : asymptotic_sigma_right ] we observe a clear velocity weakening with a characteristic @xmath62 decay towards @xmath76 .",
    "slide - hold - slide experiments are an important tool in the investigation of the tribology of solids .",
    "when the sliding of a solid is interrupted for some time @xmath77 , the contacts at the surface of the solid can strengthen over time , so that when sliding is resumed , a peak in the friction force has to be overcome before one recovers the stationary friction force .",
    "the amplitude of the friction peak increases with the hold time @xmath77 since the relaxation is more effective when it has more time to act .",
    "our model has all the necessary ingredients to reproduce the peak in the friction force after a hold period .",
    "in fact , when driven at a finite velocity , the viscoelastic elements do not have the time to completely relax to the most convenient ( i.e. , lowest energy ) configuration at each global position .",
    "if a hold time is given to the system , the mechanical energy reduces as the viscoelastic elements relax . upon resuming driving",
    ", this lower energy configuration requires a larger stress to initiate motion again .",
    "thus the effect is expected to become stronger as the hold time increases , saturating at hold times much larger than the viscoelastic relaxation time .    to simulate this process , we set the driving velocity @xmath0 to a value at which a steady sliding is observed .",
    "once we reached a stationary dynamics , the driving is stopped for some time interval @xmath77 and then resumed .",
    "the evolution of the friction force during this protocol in our model is shown in fig .",

    "the height of the friction peak as a function of the hold time @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overshoot_vs_deltat_2 ] ( right ) .",
    "we observe some similarities and some differences when comparing our results with experimental observations . in experiments , during the hold time the stress shows a relaxation towards some lower value , something which is not observed in our model .",
    "the reason is that stress relaxation can occur only if some secondary avalanches ( aftershocks ) are triggered by the viscoelastic relaxation .",
    "when the pinning thresholds @xmath51 have a single value , then aftershocks are excluded and the decrease can not happen .",
    "however in models with a wide distribution of pinning thresholds this relaxation has been observed @xcite and is compatible with experiments .",
    "qualitatively , the friction peak is similar in our simulations and in experiments : in both cases its height increases as a function of the hold time , but in experiments the increase is usually reported to be logarithmic , while here we observe an exponential saturation at large @xmath77 .",
    "the reason for this difference is that our model contains only a single relaxation time constant , which naturally defines a typical time scale , above which the system is fully relaxed and thus no longer evolves .",
    "it has been long realized that the friction force can not be described by a single valued function of the instantaneous velocity . the history of the contact plays an important role in determining the actual friction force .",
    "our model is an example of such a case , since the value of the friction force depends on the state of the viscoelastic elements , which in turn depend on the history of the system .",
    "we thus briefly recall the standard rate and state formalism , and then show how it provides an appropriate framework to understand our results .",
    "phenomenologically , the behavior of frictional contacts has been successfully described through the formalism named rate - and - state ( rs ) friction , originated in the works of dieterich and ruina @xcite . instead of assuming that there exists only a kinetic and a static friction coefficient",
    ", the rs formalism assumes that the friction coefficient continuously depends on the relative velocity @xmath78 between the two surfaces ( the rate variable ) and on a state variable usually called @xmath16 .",
    "we recall that by definition , the friction coefficient @xmath79 acts as a threshold for the friction force @xmath80 actually arising from the contacts : we always have @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the force normally applied on the solid . the usual rs form for @xmath83",
    "is : @xmath84 where @xmath85 are positive constants .",
    "note that we use a small @xmath78 to indicate the instantaneous velocity , which may differ from the driving velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath86 term describes the so - called `` direct effect '' , the increase of friction with increase of the relative velocity commonly observed in many materials .",
    "the state variable @xmath16 is supposed to follow a second equation , usually written : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the `` critical slip distance '' , i.e. the amount of slip ( of the center of mass of the sliding block ) necessary to break a newly formed junction .    under steady",
    "sliding , we have @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and the rs equations ( [ rs ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) simplify into : @xmath91 if @xmath92 this equation describes the phenomenon of velocity weakening , namely a reduction of the friction coefficient when velocity increases .",
    "velocity weakening is a crucial ingredient involved in the description of seismic phenomena@xcite . in the case",
    "in which the contact is at rest ( @xmath93 ) , we get @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath95 , and according to ( [ rs ] ) we obtain an increase of the static friction coefficient with the time of contact .",
    "rs equations have been used to describe the behaviors of frictional systems under a variety of non - steady sliding conditions , providing an excellent phenomenological description for numerous systems .      under uniform",
    "driving , our model displays two features that are common to many frictional systems : a velocity weakening friction law , and a bifurcation to a stick - slip regime for low driving velocities .",
    "we have described in section [ sec : constant_drive_proto ] how the velocity weakening effect appears in the model .",
    "now we will see that assuming the existence of this effect , the bifurcation to a stick - slip regime at low velocities is captured in all its detail by the use of the rs formalism",
    ".    the usually assumed form eq .",
    "( [ rs2 ] ) of the friction coefficient is not appropriate to accurately describe the results observed in our model in the steady sliding regime . on the one hand",
    ", our model does not have any ingredient that could produce a direct effect in the rs equation ( [ rs ] ) , suggesting that we should use @xmath96 . on the other hand , the logarithmic @xmath97 term is not appropriate in our case , mainly because we have considered only a relaxation mechanism that is described by a single time constant , the one associated to the dashpot and @xmath45 springs . instead , from our simulations of sec .",
    "[ sec : constant_drive_proto ] ( as for instance those in the right part of fig .",

    "we now assume that under any non - steady sliding situation , the value of the friction coefficient can still be written in terms of the function found in the steady state .",

    "this force @xmath80 is also the actual instantaneous friction force arising from the contacts .",
    "our aim is now to determine the temporal evolution of @xmath105 and @xmath80 and reproduce the bifurcation behavior that we obtained in section [ sec : constant_drive_proto ] .",

    "( [ g ] ) ) , we see that the rs formalism gives a very good coincidence in the low velocity , stick - slip regime .",
