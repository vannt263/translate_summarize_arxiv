    "<S> massive gravity may be viewed as a suitable limit of bimetric gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the limiting procedure can lead to an interesting interplay between the `` background '' and `` foreground '' metrics in a cosmological context . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that in bimetric theories one always has two sets of metric equations of motion continues to have an effect even in the massive gravity limit . </S>",
    "<S> thus , solutions of bimetric gravity in the limit of vanishing kinetic term are also solutions of massive gravity , but the contrary statement is not necessarily true .    </S>",
    "<S> massive gravity is the theory based on the consideration of a non - vanishing mass for the graviton . as is well - known , to construct such a mass term in the action one needs an additional two - tensor , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the dynamics of the `` foreground '' metric , @xmath1 , depends on a `` background '' metric , @xmath0 , which is specified by the definition of the theory . on the other hand , in bimetric gravity the consideration of a spin-2 @xmath2-particle interacting with the metric @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is based on a dynamical @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the new metric also has a kinetic term . </S>",
    "<S> so one has two mutually interacting metrics with the same status .    </S>",
    "<S> due to recent developments in the field@xcite we now know that a mass term which is a particular function of the square - root @xmath3 is free of the the boulware  deser ghost  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , taking an interaction term of the same form in bimetric gravity leads also to a ghost - free theory @xcite . considering @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and assuming the condition@xcite @xmath6 , one can write the square root as @xmath7 . thus , the action of the ghost - free massive gravity theory can be expressed as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 describes the matter fields coupled to @xmath1 and @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are the elementary symmetric polynomials , given by @xmath12 ^ 2-[k^2]\\right ) ; \\qquad   e_3(k)=\\frac{1}{6}\\left([k]^3 - 3[k][k^2]+2[k^3]\\right);\\nonumber\\\\ & & e_4(k)=\\frac{1}{24}\\left([k]^4 - 6[k^2][k]^2 + 3[k^2]^2 + 8[k][k^3]-6[k^4]\\right ) ; % \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13=k^\\mu{}_\\mu$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the equations of motion for massive gravity are @xmath14 with @xmath15 denoting the usual stress energy tensor associated with @xmath9 , @xmath16 the interaction term  ( [ int ] ) , therefore , leads to @xmath17 - 3)\\gamma-\\gamma^2+c_3\\left(e_2(k)\\gamma - e_1(k)\\gamma\\cdot k+\\gamma\\cdot k^2\\right )   \\nonumber\\\\ + c_4\\left(e_3(k)\\gamma - e_2(k)\\gamma\\cdot k+e_1(k)\\gamma\\cdot k^2-\\gamma\\cdot k^3\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one must also take into account the bianchi inspired constraint : @xmath18 . as in bimetric gravity </S>",
    "<S> both metrics are dynamical quantities , the action is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is coupled to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in addition to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ motion1 ] ) one has @xmath21 furthermore , both bianchi inspired constraints are equivalent .    </S>",
    "<S> it must be emphasized that whereas in massive gravity @xmath0 is non - dynamical , in bimetric gravity there are two sets of equations of motion independently of the particular limit that one considers . </S>",
    "<S> thus , solutions of bimetric gravity are always more constrained than those of massive gravity . if one wants to recover massive gravity as a limit of bimetric gravity , it should be noted that the consideration of the limit of vanishing @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ actionbg ] ) and ( [ motion2 ] ) , leads to @xmath24 and a constraint on the interaction term , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> while in contrast the limit of infinite @xmath22 ( and vanishing @xmath23 ) in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ motion2 ] ) leads to a constraint on the background metric . in the second case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is no more externally specified , which is against the philosophy of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude @xcite that the limit of vanishing @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that is of vanishing kinetic term , must be taken in bimetric gravity to recover massive gravity . taking this limit in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ motion2 ] ) implies @xmath25 , which together with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ t ] ) leads to @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the bianchi inspired constraint can be written as @xmath27 , which implies a modification equivalent to a cosmological constant , @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , _ the solutions of bimetric gravity in the limit of vanishing kinetic term are solutions of massive gravity in which the modification with respect to general relativity is equivalent to a cosmological constant_. therefore , it is of special interest to consider the cosmological solutions .    for our present purposes , </S>",
    "<S> the metrics in a spherically symmetric situation can be written as @xcite @xmath29 and @xmath30 where all the metric coefficients are functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> as has been shown in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> the solutions of the system given by @xmath25 and @xmath27 are :    _ conformally related metrics _ : @xmath33 here @xmath34 if @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> . thus we can describe a universe which is accelerating , with the physical metric having the same symmetry as the background .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conformally related sections _ : @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that both @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this solution has @xmath34 if @xmath41 .    for massive models with @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> there are two additional solutions @xcite with @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> however , they have particular interest because they allow us to consider different cosmological metrics related by some unconstrained arbitrary functions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , these solutions are :    _ independent @xmath44 _ : we can obtain flrw solutions if the theory specifies @xmath45 where @xmath46 is an arbitrary function which can be a function of @xmath47 or not , and @xmath47 is the scale factor fulfilling the friedmann equation of the physical space . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the theory is formulated with a flrw background , then we can obtain isotropic or anisotropic cosmologies given by @xmath48    _ independent @xmath44 _ : similar behavior as in the previous case , with the unconstrained function now in the temporal part .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it must be emphasized that there are , of course , more cosmological solutions of massive gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions described in this contribution are only the cosmological solutions of massive gravity continuous in the parameter space of the theory , if one insists on the desirability of this theory coming from a particular limit of bimetric gravity . </S>"
