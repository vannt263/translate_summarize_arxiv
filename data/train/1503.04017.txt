    "while we all have a feeling of what `` complex '' means , it is notoriously hard to find quantitative measures .",
    "furthermore , there are various types of complexity .",
    "the three main examples in present - day science seem to be computational complexity , process complexity , and state complexity .",
    "computational complexity refers to the amount of resources required to perform a certain computation task , be it in terms of time , memory space or number of queries , contributing to different complexity classes in computer science  @xcite .",
    "process complexity is often associated with the chaotic ( but not random ) behavior of the process , interconnectivity of many components in the process , and possibly the phenomenon of emergence  @xcite .",
    "finally , state complexity , the focus of this paper , refers to the amount of information that is required to describe , generate or simulate a state of a physical system .    why do we study the complexity of quantum states ? from a foundational point of view",
    ", complexity could be a parameter to test the limits of quantum mechanics .",
    "the direct extension of quantum effects ( coherent superpositions ) to daily objects might result in bizarre paradoxes , as schrdinger famously noticed .",
    "it is a current experimental trend to push the tests of quantum mechanics towards the macroscopic domain , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in all these experiments ,",
    "the superposition indeed involves large number of particles or excitations , nevertheless the states produced are somewhat `` simple '' : some involve the superposition of a single degree of freedom , the center of mass ; others target the ghz state , or the dicke state with few excitations , as ideal macroscopic states .",
    "the macroscopic objects of our daily experience are not only large in size , mass and number of particles , but at the same time also interconnected in a non - trivial manner : a cat , besides being large , is a complex object .",
    "do complex objects still obey quantum physics ?",
    "if yes , as most physicists would argue , can we create them in a controlled way ?",
    "these questions loomed behind the discussion on the possibility of large - scale quantum computation . in order to refine this discussion ,",
    "aaronson  @xcite took a technical step and proposed the concept of tree size ( ts ) , as a measure of complexity for quantum states .",
    "this highlights that , besides exploring the limits of quantum mechanics , quantum state complexity is a way of capturing the deep relation between complexity and computation .",
    "the origin of quantum speed up might be sought in some features of entanglement .",
    "promisingly , early studies showed that states used in various quantum algorithm display multipartite entanglement  @xcite ; while states with little entanglement could be efficiently simulated with classical computing  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , large entanglement is neither necessary  @xcite nor sufficient condition for quantum speed up : to the contrary , having too much entanglement might be detrimental to performing computation  @xcite",
    ". measures of entanglement developed with other operational meanings do not seem to capture the computational power of the state .",
    "another candidate is the phenomena of interference .",
    "previous works  @xcite propose how to quantify interference with `` ibits '' and investigate how many ibits were `` actually used '' in various quantum algorithms .",
    "the different amount of actually used ibits seems to explain the different amount of speed up in shor s and grover s algorithm .",
    "the relation with success probability in algorithm with imperfections was studied in  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we look into the relation between complexity of quantum states and quantum speed up .",
    "it seems intuitive that , _ in order to be useful in computational tasks , a state must be complex to describe and yet be simple to prepare_. indeed , if on the one hand a state is simple to describe , it should be possible to simulate it efficiently with classical computers ; on the other hand , the preparation of the state from easily available resources is part of the overall computation process . here , we focus on the first aspect : how to quantify _ the complexity of describing a quantum state _ ?    among the different measures of state complexity , quantum kolmogorov complexity is defined by length of the shortest possible program that would generate the state  @xcite .",
    "this very common definition suffers from the setback that it is not computable .",
    "moreover , kolmogorov complexity captures the complexity of _ generating _ the state .",
    "the tree size ( ts ) complexity that we mentioned before and that we are about to discuss relates more to the _ description and simulation complexity _ of quantum states .",
    "the most common way to represent quantum states is the dirac notation .",
    "tree size complexity can be understood as the size of the minimal description using this notation .",
    "this article provides a concise summary of our knowledge of the tree size , as well as some new results on complex states with superpolynomial tree size , verification of complex states , and the connection between tree size complexity and the power of quantum computation .",
    "the definition of tree size complexity is given in sec .",
    ", we review the works on states of two , three and four qubits , and describe the most complex states according to this measure . moving to the case of @xmath0 qubits ,",
    "we first discuss a few examples of simple states with polynomial tree size . in sec .  4 ,",
    "a theorem by raz for showing superpolynomial lower bound on multilinear formula sizes , which in turn lower bounds tree size , is revisited . with this theorem at hand , we show some families of states with superpolynomial tree size : the immanant states , the deutsch - jozsa states and the subgroup states . based on numerical evidence , we construct an explicit example of a subgroup state with superpolynomial tree size .",
    "more importantly , the tree size of the 2d cluster state is shown to be superpolynomial . in sec .  5 , we describe how to verify the superpolynomial tree size of the complex subgroup states and the 2d cluster state with polynomial effort via measuring a witness . the possible relation between state complexity and quantum computation speed up",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "finally , we offer a list of open problems and technical conjectures .",
    "just as bits to classical information , qubits are the basic building blocks of quantum information .",
    "any @xmath0-qubit pure states can be written in the computational basis with at most @xmath1 coefficients : @xmath2 where each @xmath3 vector @xmath4 in @xmath5 is identified as a bit string in @xmath6 .",
    "this decomposition on a computational basis is not the most compact way of writing a pure state . in the case of two qubits ,",
    "the most economic representation is given by the schmidt decomposition .",
    "this decomposition can be iterated to deal with multi - partite states , but already for three qubits a different _ ad hoc _ decomposition is more compact @xcite .",

    "minimal tree size _ introduced by aaronson in ref .",
    "@xcite as a measure of complexity of a pure state : any multiqubit state written in dirac s notation can be described by a rooted tree of @xmath7 and @xmath8 gates ; each leaf vertex is labelled with a single qubit state @xmath9 , which needs not be normalized .",
    "the three - qubit biseparable state @xmath10 , for instance , is represented by the tree in fig .",
    "the size of a tree is defined as the number of its leaves : thus , the size of the tree of fig .  [ tb ] is five .",
    "a given state can have many different tree representations ( for instance , the biseparable state in fig .",
    "[ tb ] can also be written as @xmath11 whose size would be six ) .",
    "the minimal tree of a state @xmath12 is the tree with the smallest size that describes it ; and the tree size @xmath13 is the size of the minimal tree .",
    "this measure of complexity is in principle _",
    "computable _ , though we lack efficient algorithms .",
    "moreover , a relation with multilinear formulas leads to _ lower bounds _ on the tree size .",
    "it is thus possible to show that the tree size of some states is definitely superpolynomial in the number of qubits @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such states can be considered genuinely complex , in the sense that they can not have a polynomial ( i.e. computationally efficient ) representation in dirac notation  nor in a matrix - product representation with matrices of constant size @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if the ts scales _ polynomially _ with @xmath0 , the state can be considered simple as it can be described efficiently on a classical computer . before moving to the @xmath0-qubit case ,",
    "let us familiarize ourselves with @xmath14 by looking at the states of a few qubits .",
    "one observation that is very useful for finding @xmath14 of few - qubit states is the fact that @xmath14 is invariant under invertible local operations ( ilos ) .",

    "any two states that can be transformed to each other by ilos as above are said to be equivalent under stochastic local operation and classical communication ( slocc ) .",
    "the above proposition implies that all states in a slocc equivalent class have the same @xmath14 .",

    "the @xmath14 is upper bounded by the size of this decomposition and thus is at most @xmath27 .",
    "similarly to the case of two - qubit states , we first find all the possible trees for three qubits with at most eight leaves , and then try to see which one is the minimal tree of a given state .    as stated in proposition  [ thm : ilo ] , since all the states in a slocc class has the same @xmath14 , we need only find @xmath14 of one state in a class to know @xmath14 of all the states in that class .",
    "for three qubits , it is known that the pure states can be categorized into six different classes : the product class , three biseparable classes due to permutation , the ghz class and the w class @xcite .",

    "the @xmath40 of the state is polynomial with @xmath405 ( see eqn .  ) . since we impose more restrictions , clearly @xmath406 .",
    "we can also simulate , the classical counterpart of , in : one simply implements reversible classical computation , applies a hadamard gate on a single qubit and measures in its computational basis to generate random bits if needed . since each classical bit string can be represented by a quantum product state , @xmath14 is @xmath0 at every steps , so this simulation is in .",
    "thus , we have  @xcite :    @xmath407 .    if @xmath408 , then large tree size is a necessary condition for quantum computers to outperform classical ones .",
    "unfortunately , we can only prove a weaker version of this .",
    "for this purpose , we first show a proposition that relates tree size and schmidt rank .",
    "note that one can draw a rooted tree in a binary form ( each gate has only two children ) without changing the number of leaves ( its size ) .",
    "next , for any gate @xmath409 we denote @xmath410 as the set of qubits in the state described by the subtree with @xmath409 as the root .",
    "let @xmath411 be a bipartition of the qubits into two sets @xmath412 and @xmath310 .",

    "a @xmath7 gate is called _ strictly separating _ if its children @xmath416 satisfy @xmath417 and @xmath418 . then ,    [ thm : separating]for a bipartition of the qubits into @xmath412 and @xmath310 , if there exists a polynomial sized tree such that all the @xmath7 gates are separating with respect to @xmath411 , then the schmidt rank of the state with respect to the bipartition @xmath411 is polynomial .    identify all the strictly separating @xmath7 gates in the binary tree . since the number of leaves @xmath419 is polynomial and",
    "the total number of gates in the binary tree is @xmath420 , the number of strictly separating gates , @xmath421 , is also polynomial .",
    "it is clearer to look at a representative example in fig .",

    "this @xmath8 gate contain qubits in both @xmath412 and @xmath310 , and the @xmath7 gate at the top is separating , the qubits under the sibling of the @xmath8 gate must be contained strictly in either @xmath412 or @xmath310 . without lost of generality ,",
    "let them be contained in @xmath412 and denote their state as @xmath424 .",
    "we can exchange the @xmath8 gate and the @xmath7 gate at the top so that the state becomes @xmath425 .",
    "now let us relabel @xmath426 as @xmath427 and @xmath428 as @xmath429 , the state can be written as @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
    "the same process can be applied upward until these @xmath8 gates joins at the root . in the final form of the tree",
    ", one sees that the state has a form similar to the schmidt decomposition : @xmath432 where @xmath433 contain qubits in @xmath412 and @xmath434 qubits in @xmath310 .",
    "@xmath421 , the number of terms in this schmidt - like decomposition upper bounds the true schmidt rank , hence the schmidt rank is polynomial .",
    "now suppose that at every step of the quantum computation , proposition[thm : separating ] is satisfied for all bipartitions , then the schmidt rank is polynomial for all bipartitions .",
    "it follows from a theorem by vidal  @xcite that the computation can be efficiently simulated with classical computers .     a @xmath8 gate that joins two @xmath7 gates with the following property : one of its children are contained in the set of qubit @xmath412 and the other contained in @xmath310 .",
    "the sibling @xmath424 of such a @xmath8 gate must be strictly contained in either @xmath412 or @xmath310 , for @xmath7 being separating .",
    "now we can exchange the order of @xmath8 and @xmath7 by distributing @xmath424 to @xmath435 and @xmath436 .",
    "this @xmath8 gate has the same property as before ; and this process can be repeated upward until it reaches the root , transforming the tree into a form similar to the schmidt decomposition . ]",
    "there are states that do not satisfy the condition of proposition  [ thm : separating ] , one example is the optimal tree of the most complex four qubit states ( see eqn .  ) .",
    "there are also states with polynomial @xmath14 that do not satisfy vidal s criteria , hence do not satisfy proposition  [ thm : separating ] for some bipartitions .",
    "for example , the state @xmath437 has polynomial @xmath14 , but there is a bipartition for which the schmidt rank is @xmath438 .",
    "even though some properties of tree size have been studied , there are still many open problems remained to be addressed . here we list a few of the most interesting .",
    "is @xmath439 ?",
    "if this is true , then the role of tree size in quantum computation is clear : polynomial @xmath14 means efficient classical simulation , and hence large @xmath14 is a necessary condition for quantum speed up .",

    "there are strong evidences to believe these two states have exponential @xmath14 : for the permanent state it is known that computing the permanent of a matrix is @xmath445-hard  @xcite , and a subexponential tree size for a permanent state would imply a subexponential formula to compute permanent , contradicting the exponential time hypothesis ( or a variant of it , @xmath445eth )  @xcite ; for the 2d cluster state , if we assume the contrary that it has subexponential tree size , by theorem  [ thm : mbqc ] we can simulate the polynomial - time quantum factoring protocol with some subexponential effort .",
    "this contradicts with the belief that quantum computing offers exponential speed up compared with classical computing  , shor s algorithm takes time @xmath221 time while the best classical algorithm takes about @xmath446 .",
