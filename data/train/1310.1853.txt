    "tumors develop by accumulating different mutations within a cell , which affect the cell s reproductive fitness @xcite . as @xcite",
    ", we refer to the fitness of a mutated cell as the ratio between a cell s rate to proliferate and the cell s rate of apoptosis compared to wild type cells .",
    "the higher the fitness , the more likely it is for the cell to proliferate . for high fitness values ,",
    "the population of cells growths very fast and stochastic effects play a minor role . in our model , this can be thought of as the formation of a tumor .",
    "however , many mutations have no impact on the cell s fitness , e.g.  mutations not affecting coding or regulatory sequences . other mutations may lead to a fitness disadvantage , which implies that the cell s risk of apoptosis is higher than its chance of proliferation .",
    "however , the same mutations in combination with other mutations within the same cell might lead to a large fitness advantage .",
    "we were motivated by genetic studies in burkitt lymphoma , a highly aggressive tumor , where a single genetic alteration has an impact on a wide range of other genes , some of them affect cell growth while others induce apoptosis . more specifically , a chromosomal translocation between the _ myc _ protooncogene on chromosome 8 and one of three immunoglobulin ( _ ig _ ) genes is found in almost every case of burkitt lymphoma @xcite .",
    "this leads to deregulated expression of the _ myc _ rna and in consequence , to deregulated myc protein expression .",
    "the myc protein acts as a transcription factor and has recently been shown to be a general amplifier of gene expression @xcite , targeting a wide range of different genes .",
    "most importantly , _ myc _",
    "expression induces cell proliferation . in burkitt",
    "lymphoma , the _ ig - myc _",
    "fusion is evidently the key mutation for tumorigenesis @xcite .",
    "however , _ myc _",
    "plays also a key role in inducing apoptosis @xcite .",
    "thus , the _ ig - myc _",
    "translocation alone would lead to cell death .",
    "therefore , the _ ig - myc _",
    "translocation has to be accompanied by additional mutations , which deregulate the apoptosis pathways , such as mutations affecting e.g.  _ tp53 _ or _ arf _ @xcite .",
    "these additional mutations have probably only little direct impact on the cell s fitness , since apoptosis is rare .",
    "hence , these mutations can not be considered as primary driver mutations in the context of burkitt lymphoma . however , in combination with the _ myc _",
    "mutation these additional mutations decrease the apoptosis rate .",
    "consequently , the cells proliferate fast and the population grows accordingly , leading to tumorigenesis . because all cells carry the _",
    "mutation in burkitt lymphoma , but fast growth does not start immediately with that mutation , it seems to confer its large fitness advantage only in a certain genetical context .",
    "thus , interactions between different mutations may crucially affect the dynamics of cancer progression .",
    "due to the fact that those additional mutations do not confer a direct fitness advantage , they can not be considered as driver mutations . nevertheless , at least some of them are necessary in order for the _ myc _ mutation to become advantageous for the cell .",
    "therefore , they can not be regarded as true passenger mutations , either . throughout this manuscript",
    ", we therefore call these additional mutations `` secondary driver mutations '' .    besides burkitt lymphoma ,",
    "epistatic effects in cancer initiation seem also to be relevant for other cancers .",
    "for example , we can think of the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene discussed by knudson in the context of retinoblastoma @xcite .",
    "this inactivation is neutral for the first hit but highly advantageous for the second hit , and can hence be viewed as an interaction of genes @xcite .",
    "another case is found in lung carcinomas , where activation of each of two oncogenes ( _ sox2 _ and _ prkci _ ) alone is insufficient , but in concert they initiate cancer @xcite . in other cases , there is clear evidence for sign epistasis : the _ ras _ family of proto - oncogenes is also discussed to underlie epistatic effects .",
    "amplification of _ ras _ leads to senescence in the cell . nevertheless , _",
    "ras _ is a well known oncogenic driver gene .",
    "hence , the _ ras _ mutation needs to be accompanied by other mutations @xcite .",
    "moreover , the difficulty to distinguish between drivers and passengers @xcite suggests that for a full understanding of cancer initiation it is insufficient to think of these two types of mutations only .",
    "so far , most models have focused on the idea that passenger mutations have no effect or only a little effect , whereas each driver mutation increases the fitness of the cell @xcite .",
    "other models focus on the neutral accumulation of mutations @xcite .",
    "moreover , different mutations are typically treated as independent , which is a strong assumption that will often not be fulfilled . in our model",
    ", mutations are interacting in an epistatic way @xcite : the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation depends strongly on the genetic environment , i.e.  in our case on the number of secondary driver mutations that are present in that cell .",
    "in addition we assume that the secondary driver mutations alone have almost no fitness advantage .",
    "such a dependence between mutations can strongly affect the dynamics of cancer initiation . in evolutionary biology ,",
    "epistatic systems are often analyzed regarding the structure or ruggedness of the landscape and the accessibility of different pathways @xcite .",
    "the experimental literature also studies which factors can lead to epistasis @xcite . here , we are interested in the dynamics of such an epistatic model , which we illustrate by stochastic , individual based simulations . in addition , we derive analytical results for the average number of cells with different combinations of mutations and find a good agreement with the average dynamics in individual based computer simulations .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the computation of the waiting time until cancer initiation .",
    "our results show that the dynamics in such systems of epistatic interactions are distinct from previous models of cancer initiation @xcite , which may have important consequences for the treatment of such cancers . while in previous models there is a steady increase in growth with every new mutation , in our model",
    "there is a period of stasis followed by a rapid tumor growth .",
    "of course , the biology of burkitt lymphoma is much more complex than modelled herein . to make the model more realistic",
    "one would have to distinguish between the different secondary driver mutations , since different genes contribute differently to the cells fitness , especially in a cell where the _ ig - myc _",
    "fusion is present .",
    "our model is not aimed to realistically describe such a situation in detail .",
    "instead , we focus on the extreme case of the so called _ all - or - nothing _",
    "epistasis @xcite to illustrate its effect on the dynamics of cancer initiation .",
    "as there is no theoretical analysis of epistatic effects in cancer initiation so far , a well understood minimalistic model seems to be necessary in order to illustrate the potential impact of epistasis on cancer progression .",
    "our minimalistic model clearly shows that epistasis can lead to a qualitatively different dynamics of cancer initiation .",
    "we analyze cancer initiation in a homogenous population of initially @xmath0 cells with discrete generations . in every generation ,",
    "each of the @xmath0 cells can either die or divide .",
    "if a cell divides , its two daughter cells can mutate with mutation probabilities @xmath1 for the driver mutation and @xmath2 for secondary driver mutations ( where the @xmath3 indicates that these would be called passenger mutations in closely related models ) . in principle",
    ", we could drop the assumption that these two mutation probabilities are independent on the cell of origin , but this would lead to inconvenient notation .",
    "we neglect back mutations and multiple mutations within one time step , because their probabilities are typically very small .",

    "this implies that the number of cells is constant on average as long as no further mutations occur .",
    "we assume that the initial number of cells is high and thus we can neglect that the population would go extinct @xcite . for our parameter values ,",

    "in addition acquire the primary driver mutation , divide so quickly that the population size increases rapidly .",
    "the parameters in our figures have been chosen such that a cells acquires a substantial growth advantage once the primary driver mutation co - occurs with 4 secondary driver mutations .",
    "this event can occur at any time and hence , in some simulation the number of cells can increase very early , whereas in other simulations the number of cells does not undergo fast proliferation for many generations .",
    "consequently , the rate of progression has an enormous variation .",
    "for the parameters from our figures , the time at which rapid proliferation occurs varied between @xmath27 and @xmath28 generations in 500 simulations .",
    "the distribution of these times is discussed in more detail below .",
    "we can calculate the average number of cells with a certain number of mutations at a given generation @xmath29 .",
    "the number of cells which do not have the primary driver mutation and @xmath30 secondary driver mutations ( i.e. @xmath31 ) changes on average by means of the cell s fitness and it decreases by the mutation rate @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",

    ", additionally the fitness advantage for secondary driver mutations has to be taken into account .",
    "since the number of cells with @xmath7 secondary driver mutations grows with @xmath45 , also the number of cells that can mutate grows .",

    "an intuitive explanation of this somewhat lengthy equation is given in [ sec : intuitive ] .",
    "interestingly , the case for @xmath20 is much more challenging .",
    "the underlying problem is that the normal binomial coefficient can not be expressed in a sum in the way the @xmath36-binomial coefficient can be expressed @xcite , @xmath54 when summing over all generations of the population with @xmath49 secondary driver mutations to derive the expression for the population of cells with @xmath55 secondary driver mutations , we have to calculate the sum @xmath56 when we go further and try to calculate the expression for the population with @xmath30 secondary driver mutations , we need to apply this sum @xmath57-times and hence we obtain a multi sum , @xmath58 only an analytical expression for this multi sum would allow a closed solution of the problem with @xmath20 .",
    "also taking the limit @xmath59 of our expression for @xmath44 is a substantial mathematical challenge .",
    "however , we can use our solution for @xmath44 for arbitrarily small values of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , numerical considerations show that the result for @xmath20 is very close to the case of @xmath60 .    in figure [",
    "fig : dyn ] , the dynamics of the average number of cells with a certain number of mutations , is shown , both without and with the primary driver mutation .",
    "simulation results for @xmath20 agree very well with the analytical result obtained for @xmath44 .",
    "( circles ) agree almost perfectly with the analytical result obtained for @xmath61 .",
    "the bars represent the standard deviation .",
    "cells with no mutation have a very small relative standard deviation and cells with one mutation ( i.e.  one passenger only or the driver only ) have a relatively small standard deviation .",
    "in contrast , cells with two passenger mutations for instance have a very broad standard deviation in the beginning that is approximately four times the average number . only in few realizations , a primary driver mutations co -",
    "occurs with several secondary drivers , hence the simulation data for these cases shows a large spread ( parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      next , let us calculate the distribution of the time it takes until rapid proliferation occurs .",
    "since we use a multi type , time discrete branching process , we can make use of the probability generating function to recursively calculate the probability for a certain cell type cell to be present at a certain time @xmath29 @xcite",
    ". of particular interest is the probability that a tumor initiating cell is present , i.e.  in the example above a cell with the primary driver mutation and 4 secondary driver mutations .",
    "let @xmath63 be the probability generation function for the cell type @xmath4 in the branching process described above .",
    "the probability that there is no cell with the primary driver mutation and @xmath30 secondary driver mutations at time @xmath29 , when the process starts with one @xmath64-cell , can be computed by recursively calculating @xmath65 , where @xmath66 starting with @xmath0 cells , we have to consider @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the probability that there is at least one tumor cell at time @xmath29 is @xmath68 . if we are interested in the probability @xmath69 that there is at least one tumor cell exactly at time @xmath29 , we need to subtract the probability , that there has been a tumor cell before @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ fig : timecompare ] shows the good agreement between simulations and the recursive calculation .     shown as a dashed line ( parameters : @xmath62 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , distribution over 20000 independent realizations ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the time distribution for low @xmath29 follows a power law , as shown in the inset of figure [ fig : timecompare ] .",
    "the exponent of the power law is approximately @xmath71 .",
    "if all mutations were neutral , one would expect a lead coefficient of approximately 4 to accumulate five mutations , as derived by @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the curve increases slower .",
    "numerical considerations show that the main reason for this is that , in contrast to @xcite , we allow extinction : many lineages that have accumulated mutations go extinct before the final , cancer causing mutation arises .",
    "most models in literature assume that each mutation leads to an independent and steady increase in the cells fitness @xcite . in this context ,",
    "neutral passenger mutations have no causal impact on cancer progression . only recently",
    ", some authors have considered passenger mutations not only as neutral byproducts of the clonal expansion of mutagenic cells , but as having a deleterious impact on the cells fitness @xcite .    here , we have described a model in which the fitness of the driver mutation strongly depends on the number of passenger mutations the cell has acquired .",
    "these passenger mutations , which we have termed secondary driver mutations , lead only to a small change in fitness or no change in fitness at all . as illustrated in figures [ fig : total ] , [ fig : single ] , and [ fig : dyn ] , the number of cells stays roughly constant for a long time before it rapidly increases , despite the fact that mutations occur in the process permanently .",
    "this dynamic effect of cancer initiation is very different from models in which mutations do not interact with each other .",
    "we speculate that this kind of dynamics can have important implications for diagnosis and treatment . in principle",
    ", the dynamics presented in figure [ fig : total ] can also be the result of one highly advantageous , but very unlikely driver mutation .",
    "but in such a case , cells with the driver mutation should not be present in the population before tumorigenesis .",
    "this contradicts with current knowledge about the _ myc _",
    "translocation which has also been detected in humans without lymphoma @xcite .",
    "this effect is well captured by our model , as shown in figure [ fig : single ] .    in some tumors , such as burkitt lymphoma",
    ", the neoplasms is only diagnosed after fast tumor growth has started . in this case , sequencing studies have shown that several mutations are present at the time of examination @xcite . since the patients typically do not have any symptoms in before diagnosis of the cancer ,",
    "it is possible that some mutations have virtually no direct impact on the cells fitness .",
    "nevertheless , they are necessary for the initiation of the cancer , as they indirectly allow the driver mutation to initiate rapid cell growth .",
    "this agrees well with our epistatic model , where ( nearly ) neutral secondary driver mutations occur at a fixed rate before the cancer can be diagnosed .",
    "of course , not all mutations have such an epistatic effect on primary driver mutations , some might even be considered deleterious @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our work shows that mutations that appear to be neutral in one context should not only be regarded as a neutral byproduct of the clonal expansion of mutagenic cells . instead , in some cases passenger mutations can have a serious impact in cancer initiation , in particular when there are non - trivial interactions between different mutations . in this case the term ",
    "passenger \" may not be the most appropriate one . to understand",
    "the impact of those interactions can be essential for a deeper understanding of the initiation of cancer .",
