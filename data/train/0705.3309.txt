    "the revelation of superconductivity in magnesium diboride ( mgb@xmath6 , @xmath7 k ) has stimulated renewed interest to other boride superconductors as an alternative path to novel superconductors with ever higher @xmath8.@xcite among those , yttrium hexaboride ( yb@xmath1 ) currently holds the position of second highest transition temperature ( @xmath9 k),@xcite thereby drawing considerable attention on the detailed mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "in particular , it stands as a focus of investigation on the effect of rattling motion of alkaline earth metals contained in a relatively large boron cage that gives rise to anharmonic phonons having relatively low energy ( @xmath10 mev).@xcite a similar situation is reported in a variety of novel superconductors including metal - doped silicon clathrates@xcite and @xmath11-pyrochlores.@xcite    while yb@xmath1  is known as a type ii superconductor in which the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , with @xmath3 being the magnetic penetration depth and @xmath14 the gl coherence length ) is greater than unity , it is characterized by a low upper critical field [ @xmath15 t ] and associated long @xmath16 ( @xmath17 nm , the bcs coherence length ) that is only a few times smaller than @xmath3 ( @xmath18 nm ) .",
    "this means that the volume fraction occupied by vortex cores ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the external magnetic field and @xmath21 is the flux quantum ) is relatively large in the flux line lattice ( fll ) state over the entire field range , making yb@xmath1  an ideal stage for studying the electronic structure of vortex cores in detail .",
    "in this situation , it is pointed out that the modified london ( m - london ) model , which is known to be an excellent analytical model to describe the spatial distribution of magnetic field @xmath0 for arbitrary @xmath12 but _ at low magnetic induction _ ( @xmath22),@xcite may not be appropriate for the basis to extract physical parameters out of @xmath0.@xcite one of the primary purposes of the present study is to address this potential problem by making a comparative analysis of @xmath2sr  data by both m - london and gl models , which reveals that the latter provides systematically better description of magnetic field profile at higher magnetic induction .",
    "thus , it is inferred from this study that we have to resort to the gl model for proper understanding of the fll state over the wider field range .",
    "fortunately , however , in contrast to the case of classical type ii superconductors such as nb or v ( @xmath23 ) where one might need numerical approach to obtain @xmath0 with sufficient precision,@xcite the present result suggests that an analytical solution of the gl model obtained by variational method@xcite is sufficient for the system with reasonably large @xmath12 .",
    "it must be stressed that the magnetic penetration depth controlling the actual shape of @xmath0 corresponds to an effective value of the london penetration depth determined by the superfluid density @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the effective mass of the charge carriers ) , so that it may vary according to the change in @xmath24 due to quasiparticle excitations ( breaking of the cooper pairs ) of various origins .",
    "in particular , it is anticipated that the pair breaking due to the quasiclassical doppler shift of the fermi momenta around vortices would lead to the low energy quasiparticle excitation ( the nonlinear effect).@xcite considering that the number of vortices is proportional to the external field , it is predicted that @xmath24 is more reduced at higher @xmath20 due to the doppler shift",
    ". another important consequence of the anisotropic order parameter is the nonlocal effect due to the variable coherence length [ @xmath27 that may exceed the london penetration depth ( @xmath28 ) over a certain region of the fermi surface , as it is inversely proportional to the order parameter [ @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the fermi velocity].@xcite in this situation , the flow of supercurrent is strongly modified over the region @xmath31 , leading to the change ( expansion ) of effective @xmath3.@xcite note that this is not limited to the case of nodal gap , but would be in effect for anisotropic gap ( or multi - gapped ) with the minimum gap satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "meanwhile , multi - gapped superconductors have a multitude of coherence length and associated vortex core radius within which the quasiparticles are confined .",
    "the presence of quasiparticles over the region of larger vortex cores would serve as a factor to enhance the effective @xmath3 more strongly at lower fields , thus mimicking the above mentioned volovik effect without gap nodes .",
    "we have shown that the magnetic field dependence of @xmath3 provides a useful criterion to assess the anisotropy of superconducting order parameter ; the greater field gradient ( @xmath33 ) corresponds to stronger anisotropy or multi - gapped structure in the order parameter.@xcite we demonstrate in yb@xmath1  that @xmath3 deduced from the gl model - based analysis does not depend on the external magnetic field .",
    "this provides strong microscopic evidence for the isotropic superconducting gap in yb@xmath1 .",
    "in the conventional @xmath2sr  studies of the fll state , positive muons are implanted to the superconducting specimen with their initial spin polarization perpendicular to the external magnetic field [ @xmath34 , with @xmath35 in the following ] , so that they may probe @xmath0 [ @xmath36 generated by a periodic array of magnetic vortices which are apart by @xmath37 ( with the apex angle @xmath38 for the hexagonal fll and @xmath39 for the square fll ) .",
    "considering that muon stops at the interstitial sites in the atomic unit cell of the crystalline lattice which has a periodicity much shorter than that of vortices ( @xmath40 nm for @xmath41 t assuming a hexagonal fll ) , one can presume that @xmath2sr  signal in the fll state provides a random sampling of @xmath0 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the spectral density for the internal field defined as a spatial average ( @xmath44 ) of the delta function , @xmath45 is the muon gyromagnetic ratio (= 2@xmath46 mhz / t ) , and @xmath47 is the initial phase of rotation.@xcite these equations indicate that the real amplitude of the fourier transformed muon spin precession signal , @xmath48 , corresponds to the spectral density , @xmath43 .    in general ,",
    "@xmath0 is obtained by solving the gl equation for the field profile and the order parameter @xmath49 in the self - consistent manner , which usually requires numerical approach . however , in the case of strong type ii superconductors ( @xmath50 ) , the nonlocal character is confined within the immediate vicinity of vortex cores ( @xmath51 ) and the london approximation can be extended by introducing a cutoff factor associated with the vanishing @xmath49 at the vortex center . in the modified london model",

    "the local approximation also leads to the reduction of the term @xmath65 into @xmath66 corresponding to the isotropic fermi surface . here , ",
    "local \" implies that the electromagnetic interaction does not depend on the wave vector ( @xmath57 ) , whereas that referring to the source term is primarily meant for @xmath67 .",
    "the form of @xmath61 depends on the modelling of @xmath54 and associated @xmath49 in the vicinity of vortex cores .",
    "for example , the gaussian cutoff , @xmath68 which is widely used for @xmath2sr   data analysis ( valid for @xmath22 and @xmath50 ) , is derived by the isotropic gl theory from the gaussian source term in the london equation@xcite @xmath69 although this form is presumed to be valid only in the gl limit ( i.e. , near @xmath8 ) , it is known that eq .",

    "the nearly one - to - one correspondence between the characteristic points of @xmath43 and those on @xmath0 makes it feasible to deduce complex physical parameters including @xmath3 and @xmath16 from a single @xmath2sr  spectrum .",
    "meanwhile , information on the structure of fll must be provided by other techniques ( e.g. , small angle neutron scattering ) .",
    "since no such information seems to be available for yb@xmath1 , we presume in the following that a hexagonal fll is realized . while one might argue that the m - london model should be replaced by the gl model simply because of the wider field range of applicability , we point out that the physical meaning of @xmath86 in the gl model has some uncertainty in the sense that it has a complicated field dependence as a cutoff parameter [ see eq .",

    "interestingly , those low - energy frequency modes are attributed to the vibration of y or zr atoms loosely bound in oversized boron cages that is now called  rattling \" motion . here , the longer metal to boron bond length in yb@xmath1   leads to a weaker force constant and larger vibrational amplitude favorable for higher @xmath8 .",
    "the reduction of @xmath8 under high pressure predicted from the thermal expansion measurement , which is also anticipated from the coupling to the rattling phonon , has been confirmed by the recent experiment on the pressure effect.@xcite    in the previous section , we have shown that the field and temperature dependence of @xmath3 is fully consistent with the presence of isotropic order parameter in yb@xmath1",
    ". it does not show any hint of nonlocal effect nor of low - lying quasiparticle excitation associated with the anomaly in the order parameter .",
    "this in turn suggests that the strong coupling of electrons to the rattling phonons does not necessarily lead to anomaly in the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the situation is readily understood by considering that yb@xmath1  has a highly symmetric three - dimensional ( 3d ) band structure , while mgb@xmath6 is characterized by two - dimensional @xmath199 band and 3d-@xmath200 band which lead to multi - gapped superconductivity ( see below ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the present specimen is in the dirty limit where the anisotropic feature having the length scale longer than the mean - free path ( @xmath201 nm , corresponding to @xmath202 mev assuming that @xmath203 m / s ) must be smeared out by scattering of electrons .",
    "therefore , further study with much better crystal quality may be needed for the definitive conclusion .",
    "we saw in the section [ sectiv ] that the slope @xmath164 of the field dependence of @xmath3 obtained by m - london model may be slightly overestimated when the model is applied beyond the presumed limit , @xmath204 .",
    "this may bring about a concern on the past literatures discussing the degree of gap anisotropy by the magnitude of @xmath164 .",
    "to make the situation clear , we collected results reporting the value of @xmath164 obtained by using m - london model , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ eta - hc2 ] as a plot of @xmath164 versus the maximal field of measurement ( @xmath205 ) normalized by @xmath206 at the measured temperature . as a comparison , those obtained by the gl model is also plotted for v@xmath207si ( ref . ) and yb@xmath1  ( the present result ) .     plotted against the maximal field of measurement normalized by the upper critical field , where the m - london model was used to generate @xmath208 ( the relaxation was approximated by a gaussian damping for cd@xmath6os@xmath6o@xmath209 and mgb@xmath6 ) [ ( refs . ] .",
    "filled symbols : superconductors with anisotropic gap ( circles ) or multigapped ( squares ) .",
    "open circles and triangles : those with isotropic gap ( where the gl model was used for the latter case ) .",
    "[ eta - hc2 ] ]    it is relatively well established by other experimental techniques that the group of compounds shown by the filled symbols in fig .",
    "[ eta - hc2 ] ( those with @xmath210 ) have anisotropic superconducting gap or multi - gapped , except for the case of kos@xmath6o@xmath211 ( refs . )",
    "in which the situation is not clear at this stage . while the observation that @xmath210 for those compounds supports the use of @xmath164 as a criterion for the gap anisotropy , the cases of yni@xmath6b@xmath6c ( ref . ) and mgb@xmath6 ( ref . ) might require closer examination because of large @xmath212 .",
    "fortunately for the case of yni@xmath6b@xmath6c , data with small field step exist at lower fields ( @xmath213 ) , and one can clearly observe that @xmath164 remains to be @xmath214 within the limit of m - london model ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "this may be partly attributed to the presence of point nodes in the superconducting order parameter@xcite that would give rise to the nonlocal effect in yni@xmath6b@xmath6c at higher fields .",
    "since the nonlocal effect directly affects the behavior of @xmath3 , it may be less sensitive to the difference in the modeling of vortex cores between the m - london model and gl model .",
    "in particular , the situation might be that the magnitude of @xmath164 at higher fields , which is predominantly determined by the nonlocal effect , coincides with that due to the volovik effect observed at lower fields .",
    "interestingly in yba@xmath6cu@xmath207o@xmath216 ( ybco , having line nodes ) , it is reported that @xmath217 for @xmath218 which is much smaller than @xmath219 for @xmath220 ( ref . ) , where the magnitude of @xmath164 at higher fields is explained by considering the nonlocal effect associated with the line nodes.@xcite a similar situation would be anticipated with less magnitude of @xmath164 at higher fields for the case of yni@xmath6b@xmath6c with point nodes .",
    "the point node also provides a natural explanation for small @xmath164 compared with that of ybco at lower fields .    here",
    ", it might be stressed again that there are two different sources of nonlocal effect , the one associated with the anisotropy in the superconducting order parameters and that associated with the anisotropy in the fermi surface . in general , the latter effect manifests itself as the transformation of fll from hexagonal to squared with increasing external field , where transformation occurs at relatively low fields ( e.g. , @xmath221 in yni@xmath6b@xmath6c ) .",
    "meanwhile , the anisotropy in the order parameter has relatively smaller energy scales and thereby it emerges at higher fields .",
    "while both yield a qualitatively similar modification to the effective london penetration depth ( @xmath222 ) , their consequences are independent ( even competing ) with each other.@xcite    it is now well established that mgb@xmath6 is characterized by two different energy gaps corresponding to its band structure ( @xmath223 mev for @xmath199 band and @xmath224 mev for @xmath200 band).@xcite the analysis in ref . was made before the revelation of the double gap , using the gaussian approximation instead of m - london model .",
    "however , it captures anomalous behavior of @xmath173 ( proportional to the gaussian linewidth ) unexpected for the conventional superconductors with single gap .",
    "the gaussian model is based on a crude approximation that the gaussian damping rate , @xmath199 , is primarily determined by the penetration depth ( valid for extreme type ii superconductors ) , @xmath225^{1/2},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath226 represents the reduction of @xmath199 mainly due to the overlap of vortices ( proportional to @xmath227 ) and additional narrowing due to the contribution of vortex cores.@xcite the presence of two gaps means that there are two different upper critical fields corresponding to respective coherence length , @xmath228 from which one may anticipate that @xmath229\\lambda^{-2 } , \\label{sigma2}\\ ] ] where @xmath230 ( with @xmath231 ) , @xmath232 is the fractional weight of @xmath199 component , and @xmath233 must be set to zero for @xmath234 .",
    "the second term in the above equation , which exhibits steeper field dependence than the first term , strongly reduces @xmath199 with increasing field over the field range of @xmath235 . from the viewpoint of single @xmath109",
    ", such behavior appears as an anomalous deviation of @xmath3 from eq.([sigma ] ) and thereby easily identified as an increase of @xmath164 as reported in ref .. as a matter of fact , recent attempt to analyze @xmath199 assuming a model similar to eq .",
    "( [ sigma2 ] ) reports @xmath236 nm and @xmath237 nm.@xcite considering that the magnitude of @xmath238 is as large as nearly a half of @xmath3 [ = 49(4 ) nm ] , the enhancement of @xmath3 is physically understood as that due to the qp s over a radial region @xmath239 around vortex cores .",
    "this is presumed to be a common situation for multi - gapped superconductors including another example of nbse@xmath6.@xcite we also point out that the smaller @xmath240 ( e.g. , @xmath241 in mgb@xmath6 ) may exceed @xmath3 at a certain temperature , as it increases with @xmath242 [ see eq .",
    "( [ xi - gl ] ) and fig  [ lmdxi - t](b ) ] .",
    "then , there is a possibility that the nonlocal effect may set in to further enhance the effective @xmath3 .",
    "now it is clear that the magnitude of @xmath164 indeed serves as a criterion for the anisotropy of superconducting order parameter , where that obtained from the analysis using the m - london model remains useful ( particularly those for which the maximal field range is within the presumed limit of validity , @xmath243 ) . in this context , the previous result for kos@xmath6o@xmath211 may be regarded as a strong case for the presence of anisotropic order parameter ( including multi - gap ) in this compound .",
    "considering results of other experimental techniques that the order parameter is nodeless,@xcite further analysis of @xmath2sr  data by a model based on the double - gap scenario is now in progress .",
    "we showed that the effective london penetration depth in yb@xmath1 , obtained by analyzing @xmath2sr  data using the field profile generated by the analytical gl model , is independent of external field ( @xmath168 ) over a region @xmath244 .",
    "we made a comparative analysis using the modified london model and gl model , from which it was inferred that the gl model should be used for the precise determination of @xmath164 when the field range of measurements extends over the presumed limit of validity for the m - london model ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "we also showed that the temperature dependence of @xmath173 is perfectly in line with that predicted for isotropic bcs superconductors .",
    "this , together with the observation that @xmath168 , supports for the conclusion drawn from bulk measurements that yb@xmath1   belongs to the class of conventional bcs superconductors with isotropic @xmath4-wave pairing . following this result , we re - exmined the past reports on @xmath164 obtained by the analysis based on the m - london model ( and those based on the gaussian approximation ) , and confirmed that the conclusions drawn for respective compounds remain unchanged .",
    "thus , the m - london model continues to be a useful ground for the @xmath2sr  study of vortex state within the limit of its validity .",
