    "the statistics of first passage events for non - markovian stochastic processes has attracted considerable recent interest in the physical literature .",
    "such problems appear naturally in spatially extended nonequilibrium systems , where the dynamics at a given point in space becomes non - markovian due to the coupling to the neighbours .",
    "the asymptotic decay of first passage probabilities turns out to be hard to compute even for very simple systems such as the one - dimensional glauber model @xcite or the linear diffusion equation with random initial conditions @xcite . indeed , determining the first passage probability of a general gaussian process with known autocorrelation function is a classic unsolved problem in probability theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the first passage statistics of fluctuating interfaces .",
    "the large scale behaviour of the models of interest is described by the linear langevin equation @xmath14 for the height field @xmath15 . here",

    "we will generally assume a flat initial interface , @xmath19 .",

    "this will be referred to as the _ transient persistence probability _ , characterized by the exponent @xmath5 , @xmath34 on the other hand , for @xmath35 the interface develops roughness on all scales and the memory of the flat initial condition is lost . in this limit",
    "@xmath30 describes the return to a rough initial configuration drawn from the steady state distribution of the process , and the corresponding _ steady state _ persistence probability @xmath36 decays with a distinct exponent @xmath37 , @xmath38 in general , one expects that @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 , with a crossover function connecting the two regimes .",
    "a particular case of the steady state persistence problem was studied previously in the context of tracer diffusion on surfaces @xcite . in this work",
    "it was observed that the distribution of first return times has a natural interpretation as a distribution of _ trapping times _ during which a diffusing particle is buried and can not move ; thus the first passage exponent may translate into an anomalous diffusion law .",
    "a simple scaling argument ( to be recalled below in section v ) was used to derive the relation @xmath43 which was well supported by numerical simulations for @xmath44 .",
    "a primary motivation of the present work is therefore to investigate the validity of this relation through simulations for other values of @xmath1 and refined analytic considerations , as well as to understand why it fails for the transient persistence exponent @xmath5 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we convert the non - stationary stochastic process @xmath15 into a stationary gaussian process in logarithmic time @xcite .",
    "this representation will provide us with a number of bounds and scaling relations , and will be used in the simulations of section iv.c .",
    "a perturbative calculation of the persistence exponents in the vicinity of @xmath45 is presented in section iii .",
    "the simulation results are summarized in section iv .",
    "section v reviews the analytic basis of the relation ( [ relation ] ) and makes contact to earlier work on the return statistics of fractional brownian motion , while section vi employs the expression ( [ relation ] ) for @xmath37 to numerically generate exact upper and lower bounds on @xmath5 .",
    "finally , some conclusions are offered in section vii .",
    "following refs.@xcite we introduce the normalized random variable @xmath46 which is considered a function of the logarithmic time @xmath47 .",
    "the gaussian process @xmath48 is then stationary by construction , @xmath49 , and the autocorrelation function @xmath50 obtained from ( [ auto ] ) is @xmath51 in logarithmic time the power law decay ( [ p0 ] ) of the persistence probability becomes exponential , @xmath52 , and the task is to determine the decay rate @xmath5 as a functional of the correlator @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "similarly a normalized stationary process can be associated with the steady state problem .",
    "first define the height difference variable @xmath53 and compute its autocorrelation function in the limit @xmath35 , @xmath54\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{as } & & = k [ t^{2 \\beta } + t'^{2 \\beta } - \\vert t ' - t \\vert^{2 \\beta}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is precisely the correlator of fractional brownian motion with hurst exponent @xmath1 @xcite ( see section v ) .",
    "next @xmath55 is normalized by @xmath56 and rewritten in terms of @xmath47 .",
    "this yields the autocorrelation function @xmath57    comparison of eqs.([f0 ] ) and ( [ fs ] ) makes it plausible that the two processes have different decay rates of their persistence probabilities .",
    "both functions have the same type of short time singularity @xmath58 which places them in the _ class _ @xmath59 in the sense of slepian @xcite .",

    ", the calculation of the decay exponent @xmath0 of the persistence probability is very hard . only in a very few cases exact results",
    "are known @xcite .",
    "approximate results can be derived for certain classes of autocorrelators @xmath64 .",
    "for example , when @xmath65 for small @xmath60 ( an example being the linear diffusion equation @xcite ) , the density of zero crossings is finite and an independent interval approximation ( iia ) @xcite gives a very good estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "however , for any other process for which @xmath66 for small @xmath60 with @xmath67 , the density of zeros is infinite and the iia breaks down . for general proceses with @xmath68 , a perturbative method (",
    "when the process is not far from markovian ) and an approximate variational method was developed recently @xcite .",
    "this method will be applied to the present problem in section iii . in the remainder of this section",
    "we collect some exact bounds on @xmath0 ; further bounds will be derived in section vi .",
    "slepian @xcite has proved the following useful theorem for stationary gaussian processes with unit variance : for two processes with correlators @xmath69 and @xmath70 such that @xmath71 for all @xmath60 , the corresponding persistence probabilities satisfy @xmath72 ; in particular , the inequality @xmath73 holds for the asymptotic decay rates .",
    "by applying this result to the correlators ( [ f0 ] ) and ( [ fs ] ) we can generate a number of relations involving the return exponents @xmath5 and @xmath37 .",
    "for example , taking the derivative of ( [ f0 ] ) with respect to @xmath1 one discovers that @xmath74 increases monotonically with decreasing @xmath1 for all @xmath60 , and consequently @xmath75 for @xmath76 the stronger inequality @xmath77 is proved in the appendix .",

    "a process characterized by a purely exponential autocorrelation function @xmath81 is markovian , and its persistence probability can be computed explicitly @xcite ; the asymptotic decay rate @xmath0 is equal to the decay rate @xmath82 of the correlation function .",
    "thus the fact that @xmath83 can be bounded by markovian ( exponential ) correlation functions supplies us with the inequalities @xmath84 @xmath85 the last inequality can be sharpened to @xmath86 this will be demonstrated in the appendix , where we also prove that @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 @xmath90    next we record some relations for special values of @xmath1 .",
    "we noted already that for @xmath3 the interface fluctuations reduce to a random walk , corresponding to the markovian correlator @xmath91 , for which @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath93 for @xmath94 both ( [ f0 ] ) and ( [ fs ] ) become constants , @xmath95 .",
    "this implies that the corresponding gaussian process is time - independent , and consequently @xmath96    for @xmath7 the transient correlator ( [ f0 ] ) degenerates to the discontinuous function @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "since this is bounded from above by the markovian correlator @xmath99 for any @xmath82 , we conclude that @xmath100 in contrast , the steady state correlator tends to a nonzero constant , @xmath101 for @xmath102 , with a discontinuity at @xmath103 , and therefore @xmath37 is expected to remain finite for @xmath7 .",
    "note that all the relations derived for @xmath37  equations ( [ bounds],[bounds2],[beta1 ] )  are consistent with @xmath4 .",
    "we have already remarked that both the steady state and the transient processes reduce to a markov process when @xmath45 .",
    "two of us have developed a perturbation theory for the persistence exponent of a stationary gaussian process whose correlation function is close to a markov process @xcite .",
    "when the persistence probability for a markov process is written in the form of a path integral , it is found to be related to the partition function of a quantum harmonic oscillator with a hard wall at the origin .",

    "having convinced ourselves , in the preceding section , that the expression ( [ relation ] ) for @xmath37 is in fact exact in the whole interval @xmath2 , we can now employ the same strategy to obtain further bounds by comparing @xmath260 to @xmath261 .",
    "these bounds turn out to be very powerful because @xmath260 and @xmath261 share the same type of singularity at @xmath103 ( see eqn.([sing ] ) ) .",
    "let @xmath262 and @xmath263 be monotonically decreasing functions with the same class of analytical behaviour near @xmath103 .",
    "there will always exist numbers @xmath264 and @xmath265 such that @xmath266 is satisfied for all @xmath60 .",
    "since the persistence exponent for a process with correlation function @xmath267 is just @xmath268 , where @xmath269 is the persistence exponent for the process with correlation function @xmath262 , we can deduce from slepian s theorem that @xmath270 .",
    "we may therefore find upper and lower bounds for the persistence exponent of a given process if we know the persistence exponent for another process in the same class .",
    "in particular , we may use the result ( [ relation ] ) for @xmath37 to obtain bounds for @xmath5 .",
    "finding by analytic means the most restrictive values of @xmath264 and @xmath265 such that @xmath271 is a formidable task .",
    "our approach is to study the analytical behaviour near @xmath103 and @xmath272 to find values where the inequalities are satisfied in the vicinity of both limits , and then investigate numerically whether the inequalities are satisfied away from these asymptotic regimes .",
    "the same leading small-@xmath60 behaviour is obtained for @xmath273 and @xmath260 when @xmath274 , and the same large-@xmath60 behaviour is found when @xmath275 for @xmath276 and @xmath277 for @xmath278 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath279 surprisingly , we find in the majority of cases that the inequalities ( [ amin ] ) and ( [ amax ] ) are satisfied as equalities .",
    "specifically , in the cases where the corrections to the leading analytic behaviour has the appropriate sign to ensure that @xmath273 is a bound for @xmath280 in both limits @xmath281 and @xmath282 , then numerical investigation revealed it to be a bound for all @xmath60 .",
    "we are therefore able in the following cases to quote the most restrictive bounds and their region of applicability in analytical form , although the validity of the bounds has only been established numerically . @xmath283",
    "the two critical values @xmath284 and @xmath285 correspond to the solutions in @xmath260 , 0.5[$ ] of @xmath286 and @xmath287 respectively . note that ( [ tmax2 ] ) coincides with the rigorous result in eq .",
    "( [ bound2 ] )    for other values of @xmath1 , the sign of the leading corrections implies that ( [ amin ] ) and ( [ amax ] ) is only satisfied as an inequality , and the best value of the bound has to be obtained numerically by finding the value of @xmath288 where @xmath273 touches @xmath289 at a point .",
    "it is also possible to obtain bounds on @xmath290 by comparing @xmath280 with @xmath291 , where @xmath292 .",
    "consideration of the behaviour at small-@xmath60 shows that a lower bound on @xmath5 may be obtained when @xmath293 , whereas an upper bound may be obtained for @xmath294 . in the majority of cases",
    ", it can be shown that the most restrictive bounds are in fact obtained by @xmath295 .",
    "for instance , consideration of the large-@xmath60 behaviour for @xmath296 shows that @xmath297 , so @xmath298 therefore , since this inequality is satisfied as an equality for @xmath295 ( see ( [ tmin1 ] ) ) , and @xmath299 , the best bound is obtained when @xmath295 .",
    "similarly , the inequalities ( [ tmax1 ] ) and ( [ tmax2 ] ) can be shown to be the best obtainable by this method . however , for @xmath300 , a perturbative consideration with @xmath301 shows that a larger value of @xmath302 may be obtained for @xmath303 small and positive , so ( [ tmin2 ] ) is not the best bound that may be obtained .",
    "a numerical investigation shows that the optimal value of @xmath304 is nevertheless very close to @xmath1 , and an improvement in @xmath305 of no more than @xmath306 was so obtained . for @xmath1 outside the ranges quoted in ( [ tmin1][tmax2 ] ) , it was found by numerical investigation that @xmath307 gave the best bound .",
    "numerical values of these bounds are listed in table  i , for comparison with the simulation data .",
    "the contents of the last three columns of this table are also plotted in figure 5 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds are ( perhaps ) surprisingly close together .",
    "notice that the lower bound for @xmath5 when @xmath308 is @xmath309 , whereas the discrete solid - on - solid simulations yielded the inconclusive value @xmath310 .",
    "all the other data are consistent with the bounds , within numerical error .",
    "it is interesting to note that the data , as well as the exact perturbation theory result , tend to lie much closer to the lower than the upper bound .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the first passage statistics for a one - parameter family of non - markovian , gaussian stochastic processes which arise in the context of interface motion .",
    "we have identified two persistence exponents describing the short time ( transient ) and long time ( steady state ) regimes , respectively .    for the steady state exponent the previously conjectured relation @xmath311 @xcite was confirmed .",
    "while this relation follows from simple scaling arguments applied to the original process , it is rather surprising when viewed from the perspective of the equivalent stationary process with autocorrelation function ( [ fs ] ) : it provides the _ exact _ decay exponent for a family of correlators whose class @xmath59 ( in the sense of slepian @xcite ) covers the whole interval @xmath3120,2[$ ] ; previous exact results were restricted to @xmath68 and @xmath313 @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated in section vi how this can be exploited to obtain accurate upper and lower bounds for other processes within the same class .",
    "estimates for the nontrivial transient exponent @xmath5 were obtained using a variety of analytic , exact and perturbative approaches , as well as from simulations . the numerical techniques  direct simulation of interface models and construction of realizations of the equivalent stochastic process , respectively  are complementary , in the sense that the former is restricted to the regime @xmath9 , while the latter gives the most accurate results for @xmath11 .",
    "the results summarized in figure 5 provide a rather complete picture of the function @xmath290 .    finally , we briefly comment on a possible experimental realization of our work .",
    "langevin equations of the type ( [ langevin ] ) are now widely used to describe time - dependent step fluctuations on crystal surfaces observed with the scanning tunneling microscope @xcite . from such measurements the autocorrelation function of the step position can be extracted , and different values of @xmath1 have been observed , reflecting different dominant mass transport mechanisms @xcite .",
    "thus it seems that , perhaps with a slight refinement of the observation techniques , the first passage statistics of a fluctuating step may also be accessible to experiments .",

    "to establish ( [ bounds2 ] ) we need to show that @xmath314 for all @xmath60 , provided that @xmath11 . to this end",

    "the inequalities ( [ bound3 ] ) are a little more subtle to prove .",
    "let us first consider the case @xmath331 .",
    "we need to prove that @xmath332 for all @xmath60 .",
    "then the relation @xmath333 will follow from slepian s theorem . denoting @xmath334 and using the expressions of @xmath74 and @xmath83",

    "the first derivative , @xmath343 starts at the positive value @xmath344 at @xmath338 and approaches @xmath341 from the negative side as @xmath345 .",
    "the second derivative @xmath346 starts at @xmath347 as @xmath348 and approaches @xmath349 as @xmath350 .",
    "we first show that @xmath346 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath321 in @xmath337 .    to establish this",
    ", we consider the third derivative , @xmath351 , where @xmath352 now , since @xmath353 for all @xmath337 , we have @xmath354 $ ] implying @xmath355 for @xmath337 .",
    "since @xmath356 , it follows that @xmath357 for all @xmath337 .",
    "therefore , @xmath346 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath321 for @xmath337 and hence crosses zero only once in the interval @xmath358 $ ] .",
    "this implies that the first derivative @xmath343 has one single extremum in @xmath358 $ ] .",
    "however , since @xmath343 starts from a positive value at @xmath338 and approaches @xmath341 from the negative side as @xmath345 , this single extremum must be a minimum .",
    "therefore , @xmath343 crosses zero only once in @xmath358 $ ] implying that the function @xmath359 has only a single extremum in @xmath358 $ ] . since",
    ", @xmath359 for @xmath360 and @xmath345 , this must be a maximum .",
    "furthermore , @xmath359 can not cross zero in @xmath358 $ ] because that would imply more than one extremum which is ruled out .",
    "this therefore proves that @xmath332 for all @xmath60 for @xmath361 and hence , using slepian s theorem , @xmath10 . using similar arguments , it is easy to see that the reverse , @xmath362 is true for @xmath363 .",
    "finally we prove the inequality ( [ bound0b ] ) which relates the values of @xmath5 for two different exponents @xmath1 and @xmath364 , subject to an additional constraint to be specified below . in the same spirit as above",
    ", one can show that after defining @xmath365 , one obtains @xmath366 both functions in ( [ ineqgen ] ) decay exponentially at large time with the same decay rate @xmath367 , such that their ratio approaches a constant when @xmath368 .",
    "the last condition @xmath369 expresses that the limit of this ratio must be less than unity . as @xmath370 in the vicinity of @xmath103 (",

    "the last condition in ( [ ineqgen ] ) expressing this constraint can be violated only if @xmath11 and @xmath374 .",
    "using slepian s theorem , and the fact that the persistence exponent associated with @xmath375 is exactly @xmath376 times the persistence exponent associated with @xmath260 @xcite , we arrive at the inequality ( [ bound0b ] ) which holds under the conditions stated in ( [ ineqgen ] ) . setting @xmath1 or @xmath304 equal to @xmath377 ( keeping @xmath378 ) , eq.([bound0b ] )",
