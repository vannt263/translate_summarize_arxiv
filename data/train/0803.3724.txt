    "moreover , the systematic study of the scattering of such high energy neutrinos with baryonic matter might prove to be an essential instrument to test new physics effects , such as those given by models of low scale gravity ( lsg ) .",

    "the analytical calculations are presented in the most general case of @xmath7 extra - dimensions , but the numerical calculations were performed for @xmath0 to illustrate the magnitude of the effects for a value of the extra dimensions that is only weakly constrained by current laboratory and astrophysical data ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "lower dimensions are required by astrophysical data to have corresponding gravity scales too high to allow significant effects on the uhe cross sections , whereas @xmath99 are constrained only by collider data , which put lower limits on the gravity scale less than a tev @xcite .",
    "the cross sections are only mildly dependent on @xmath7 , at any rate @xcite . previous applications of the add - type models to the uhe neutrino cross section and expectations for event rates relied on the saddle point estimation of the eikonal amplitude , and only in the thin brane limit .",
    "our application completes the picture of the impact of low scale gravity on the predictions of high energy neutrino - nucleon cross sections .",
    "we reach the same qualitative conclusions as previous studies : the effects are sensitive to the scale , or radius , of the extra dimensions but much less sensitive to the actual number of dimensions .",
    "we also find that the brane tension , or thickness , greatly affects the size of lsg influence on uhe neutrino scattering , weakening sharply as brane tension decreases , or equivalently as brane thickness increases .",
    "this is in agreement with similar predictions for hadron collider applications @xcite .",
    "quantitatively speaking , we have found that the presence of new physics at lsg @xmath93 gev enhances the `` neutral current '' cross section compared to the standard model cross section by three order of magnitude at cm energies of @xmath96 gev and above , and that the full eikonal calculation of the cross section gives values consistently higher than the corresponding saddle point approximation , when the brane is considered to be infinitely thin .",
    "the enhancement above the standard model expectation is not nearly as marked in the case of a brane physically extended @xmath100 gev@xmath101 along the extra - dimensions , or in the case where the lsg planck mass is increased by a factor of two .",
    "however , we found that calculations of the cross sections performed with brane tensions of 10 tev and above are indistinguishable , indicating that a ratio of tension to gravity scale of 10:1 is effectively `` infinite '' for these purposes .",
    "the preceding statement is quite @xmath7-independent as can be seen from the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ sjod_chi ] ) : since in the region of validity of the ea ( @xmath102 ) the impact parameter @xmath103 is of the order of @xmath45 , one can see that when @xmath104 the hypergeometric function @xmath105 tends rapidly to @xmath106 .",
    "the eikonal phase is therefore of order one , as expected , independently from the number of extra - dimensions .",
    "correspondingly , the approach to the thin brane limit is only weakly dependent on @xmath7 .    to understand the difference between the uhe cross section evaluated in the saddle point approximation versus the full eikonal calculation , we recall that the saddle point dominance of the integral in question requires @xmath107 . in our eikonal evaluation , as in those in ref .",
    "@xcite , we required @xmath108 .",
    "let us check the consistency of these two requirements .",
    "defining @xmath109 , we find that @xmath110 as @xmath111 runs from @xmath112 gev to @xmath113 gev for @xmath3 = @xmath114 gev and @xmath0 .",
    "the ranges are @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "moreover , the saddle point value of the impact parameter , @xmath118 is only slightly less than @xmath45 for these parameter choices , failing to satisfy the condition @xmath119 needed for saddle point dominance of the phase integral , eq .",
    "( [ grw_f ] ) .",
    "these considerations tell us that , even with the maximal @xmath120 consistent with use of the eikonal , the strong coupling , saddle point conditions are , at best , only marginally satisfied even at the highest , super gzk energies we consider .",
    "the sensitivity of the calculation to @xmath6 and @xmath3 values is much more important to the estimate of event rates than the sensitivity to the use of the saddle point approximation , rather than the full ea .",
    "since collisions that satisfy the ea conditions tend to be highly elastic , the consequences for event rate estimates based on the model assumptions are not severe , since the fraction of deposited energy is small , and the corresponding events are mixed with highly inelastic events at neutrino energies an order of magnitude or more lower , where the flux is presumably much larger .",
    "thus the factor of ten difference in cross section between the @xmath121 1 tev and 2 tev , or between the infinite and finite tension at fixed lsg is , in a sense , part of uncertainty in a `` background '' correction to inelastic processes , such as black hole formation , where the neutrino energy is nearly all converted to visible energy .",
    "only if black hole formation is severely suppressed , does the enhanced signal from elastic processes become a sensitive tool to detect lsg .    in summary ,",
    "our conclusions are that , in agreement with other studies in collider settings , the lsg effects are sensitively dependent on the choice of scale parameters - the gravity scale and the brane tension .",
    "the eikonal neutrino - nucleon cross section always rises sharply above the standard model versions , but the energy at which the onset occurs and the degree to which the new physics dominates , is strictly dictated by the input scales . in the regime",
    "we consider , @xmath122 gev , the saddle point dominance conditions are not well satisfied , and the approximation , though lending itself to simple expressions and intuitive pictures , noticeably underestimates the cross section .",
