    "3d print technology is a fast growing field for single - unit production , and it allows to produce structures that have been difficult or impossible to build before .",
    "ndfeb magnets are mainly divided into sintered and polymer bonded magnets . on the one hand ,",
    "sintered magnets have the highest maximum energy product @xmath1 , on the other hand polymer bonded magnets enable the manufacturing of complex shapes and magnetization structures , but with a lower @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are widely used wherever product cost is a major consideration over magnetic performance @xcite .",
    "bonded magnets offer a wide application range from sensor to actuator applications @xcite .",
    "polymer bonded magnets are composites with permanent - magnet powder embedded in a polymer binder matrix .",
    "hard magnetic particles , ferrite ( e.g. sr , ba ) , and rare - earth materials ( e.g. ndfeb ) with a volume filler content between 40    65vol.% are inserted .",
    "these compounds can be further processed with injection molding or extrusion @xcite .",
    "the ndfeb particles for the compounds are produced by a melt spinning process . to achieve better rheological behavior ,",
    "spherical particles are preferred , which can be produced by an inert gas atomization process . to reduce assembling costs and",
    "reach more flexibility , magnetically isotropic powder is preferred .",
    "the high filler content increases the viscosity of the melted compound @xcite . to avoid clogging of the nozzle ,",
    "the matrix polymer should be of a high flowable material , good mechanical properties are an important aspect , too .",
    "polyamide ( pa6 , pa11 , and pa12 ) have a good combination of these qualities .",
    "recently it was shown that an end - user 3d printer can be used to print polymer bonded rare - earth magnets with a complex shape @xcite . a prefabricated magnetic compound ( neofer@xmath0 25/60p ) from magnetfabrik bonn gmbh has been used .",
    "it consists of 90wt.% ndfeb grains in a pa11 matrix .",
    "the effectiveness of this printing method is demonstrated by fabrication of a magnet with a complex shape that is known to produce a specific stray field above the printed magnet .",

    "the baam method operates within the same principle as a conventional 3d printer .",
    "an advantage of this method is the possibility to manufacture large scale objects , disadvantages are the high system costs and printing of fine structures is impossible due to the large printer nozzle size .",
