    "therefore both of the general observations proven in the preceding section apply to our code . assuming the availability of single photon sources , a logical state that can be generated easily is @xmath71 .",
    "the first step towards an experimental realization of the code would be the generation of other states from the code subspace .",
    "one way to achieve this is to construct single gates operating in the code subspace , and we will discuss this approach within the linear - optics paradigm .",
    "let us first consider a scenario when the three signal modes carrying the encoded qubit are combined with an arbitrary number of auxiliary vacuum modes and subjected jointly to a unitary linear transformation .",
    "the output in the three signal modes is accepted conditionally on the detection of zero photons in all the auxiliary modes .",
    "this procedure includes deterministic gates as a specific case .",
    "if the auxiliary modes are prepared and detected in the vacuum state , the transformation of the state contained in the signal modes depends only on a @xmath72 sector of the entire unitary matrix describing the transformation of the modes , which relates the input signal modes @xmath73 to the output signal modes @xmath74 .",
    "we will denote this sector by @xmath75 , and the resulting conditional transformation acting in the space of the three signal modes by @xmath76 .",
    "the sector @xmath77 can be extended to a unitary matrix by adding auxiliary modes provided that the inequality @xmath78 is satisfied , and this condition can be always met by an appropriate rescaling of @xmath77 at the cost of lowering the success rate of the gate .",
    "we will now derive constraints on @xmath79 that result from the condition @xmath80 stating that the code subspace needs to be preserved .",
    "we will discuss separately three cases according to the number of zeros in the first column of @xmath79 .",
    "let us first assume that the product @xmath81",
    ". in this case we can write : @xmath82 the condition @xmath83 implies then that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "furthermore , the requirement @xmath86 and also that @xmath87 .",
    "this means that the parameters @xmath88 are arbitrarily permuted cube roots of one @xmath89 .",
    "an analogous consideration applied to the scalar products of @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 implies that also @xmath93 must be equal to three different cube roots of one .",
    "finally , the condition @xmath94 gives @xmath95 , which means that the vectors @xmath96 and @xmath97 are orthogonal .",
    "if we demand that @xmath98 also remains in the code subspace , then vanishing projections onto states @xmath99 and @xmath100 imply that @xmath101 .",
    "this means that the vector @xmath102 is orthogonal to both @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and the only nontrivial possibility to meet this condition is @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the parameters @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are given , up to a common multiplicative constant , by arbitrary cube roots of one .",
    "the upper bound on their magnitude can be derived from the condition @xmath107 , giving @xmath108 .",
    "the success rate of the gate performed on the encoded qubit is maximized when the last inequality is saturated .",
    "then the matrix @xmath79 is unitary , and there is no need to introduce auxiliary vacuum modes",
    ".    the second case is when exactly one element in the first column of @xmath79 is zero . because of the symmetry of the code",
    ", we can assume with no loss of generality that @xmath109 .",
    "considering the scalar products @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and it is sufficient to ensure that @xmath98 stays in the code subspace .",
    "because of conditions @xmath112 and @xmath113 and @xmath114 must be either zero or non - zero . in the former case it is straightforward to see that @xmath115 . in the latter case , considering vanishing projections of @xmath98 onto @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 gives that @xmath122 , which again implies that @xmath115 .",
    "thus we are left with the case when at least two elements in the first column of @xmath79 are zero . applying the reasoning from the preceding paragraph to the second and",
    "the third column shows that each column must have at least two zero elements .",
    "considering the remaining cases leads to a conclusion that @xmath79 must be given , up to a permutation of rows and columns , to a diagonal matrix with elements proportional to arbitrarily chosen cube roots of one .",
    "the success rate is largest when the proportionality factor has unit absolute value , giving a unitary form of @xmath79 .",
    "as the code words are symmetric in the modes , the matrices @xmath79 derived above can be considered up to arbitrary permutations of rows and columns , which obviously do not alter transformations in the code subspace .     can be transformed deterministically using linear optics into any of three states indicated with dots .",
    "all linear optics transformations that do not involve auxiliary photons are given by the rotation group of the tetrahedron , generated from a @xmath123 rotation @xmath124 around the vertical axis and a @xmath125 rotation @xmath126 around the axis passing through the midpoints of the opposite edges of the tetrahedron . ]    consequently , the entire set of @xmath79s that preserve the code subspace consists of unitary matrices .",
    "this set can be generated from two transformations , given up to overall phase factors by : @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "the above linear - optics transformations are respectively a tritter @xcite splitting equally any input port between the three output ports , and a simple @xmath123 phase shift applied to one of the modes .",
    "the geometric structure of the set of allowed transformations can be understood by considering logic states that are obtained from the basis state @xmath69 by a repetitive application of the generators @xmath126 and @xmath124 in an arbitrary order .",
    "it is easy to verify that this yields three states of the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 , which together with @xmath69 form a regular tetrahedron in the bloch sphere of the logic qubit , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] .",
    "thus the entire set of single - qubit operations that can be implemented using linear optics without auxiliary photons is identical with the rotation group @xmath131 of that tetrahedron , and the generators @xmath126 and @xmath124 correspond to two rotations by @xmath125 and @xmath123 about axes depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sphere ] .",
    "the measurement of the logical qubit in the basis @xmath132 , @xmath133 , or @xmath126 , allows one to realize a projection in the basis composed of any of the states @xmath134 and its orthogonal complement .",
    "this provides sufficient data for a complete tomographic reconstruction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , given a quantum process that preserves the code subspace , its action can be fully characterized by feeding it with states @xmath135 , and performing state tomography on the output .     to generate the state @xmath136 .",
    "one of the output modes from the tritter is combined with the remaining photon and the input qubit .",
    "the output is accepted upon detecting a combination @xmath137 .",
    "filled circles denote phase shifts , and horizontal bars are beam splitters with real amplitude transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "the convention is that the beam reflected off the thickened side of a beam splitter acquires a minus sign .",
    "the sign change is introduced also by four mirrors .",
    "the amplitude reflection coefficients for the beam splitters are : @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 . ]",
    "in this section we will present a universal linear - optics circuit that converts a single qubit in the standard dual - rail representation into a qubit encoded in the loss - proof @xmath144 basis . as we demonstrated in this paper , such a procedure can not be implemented derministically using a passive linear - optics network . our circuit , depicted in fig .",

    "one of the modes leaving the tritter , which we shall label with the index @xmath147 , is then combined with the input qubit and the remaining auxiliary photon in a four - mode network encircled with a dashed line in fig .  [",

    "we performed a numerical search over networks that combine in an arbitrary way all the six input modes and any number of additional vacuum modes , which did not improve the success rate .",
    "the presented encoding circuit can be however applied to encode a single copy of a qubit in an unknown state by using it `` off - line '' , following the idea of teleportation - based computational primitives @xcite .",
    "the first step is to apply the encoding circuit to a qubit that belongs to a maximally entangled pair composed of two photons in a state @xmath160 , repeating the procedure on freshly prepared pairs until the successful operation is achieved .",
    "then the second qubit from the successful pair is measured jointly with the input qubit using a projection onto four maximally entangled states defined as : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a subgroup of tetrahedron rotations consisting of the identity and three rotations by @xmath125 , and @xmath163 are unitaries that generate these transformations in the single - qubit bloch sphere .",
    "the measurement step can be performed nearly deterministically using universal linear - optics quantum circuitry with auxiliary single photons and fast feed - forward @xcite .",
    "this leaves the encoded qubit in the desired state up to one of the rotations from the subgroup @xmath164 which can be compensated for by an optional application of one of the deterministic linear - optics transformations @xmath126 , @xmath165 , or @xmath166 .",
    "and @xmath167 and a phase delay @xmath168 .",
