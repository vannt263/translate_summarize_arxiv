    "variational approaches based on tensor networks  @xcite are a novel powerful numerical tool believed to be the key ingredient to simulate efficiently quantum - many body systems .",
    "although a detailed understanding of their potentialities and their limitations is presently under scrutiny , there are already a number of encouraging results .",
    "variational tensor networks ( vtn ) are free of most of the problems of traditional numerical methods . differently from quantum monte",
    "carlo methods , vtn do not suffer of the sign problem .",
    "compared to density matrix renormalization group  @xcite , they are more versatile and allow to simulate efficiently critical correlations , long - range interactions and two- and higher - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "indeed the density matrix renormalization group can be reformulated in terms of a particular class of tensor networks known as matrix product states  @xcite .",
    "vtn include also projected entangled pair states  @xcite that generalize matrix product states in dimensions higher than one and weighted graph states  @xcite designed to study systems with long - range interactions .    among the proposed vtns , a very promising one is the so - called multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera )  @xcite .",
    "mera has been already applied successfully to the study of a number of different physically relevant systems , like quantum models on a two - dimensional lattices  @xcite , interacting fermions  @xcite , and critical systems  @xcite , only to mention a few of the most remarkable examples .",
    "the capability of mera to describe accurately critical systems derives directly from the scale - invariant self similarity of its tensor structure , intimately related to a real - space renormalization procedure .",
    "the structure of the mera state is designed  @xcite in such a way to reproduce scale - invariance and so , in one - dimensional systems , it naturally encoded several important features of the conformal field theory ( cft ) underlying the critical lattice model  @xcite .",
    "the critical exponents can be computed directly from the spectrum of the mera transfer matrix  @xcite .",
    "critical systems can however lack translational invariance , due to the presence of a physical boundary or to an impurity .",
    "the study of boundary critical phenomena is , since many years , a very active field of research which ranges from the study of the critical magnets with surfaces to quantum impurity problems ( as e.g. kondo ) or the casimir effects ( for a review of the field see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the boundary does not spoil conformal invariance .",
    "oppositely , boundary cfts have a very rich structure and a deep mathematical foundation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "while in fact it started only as the study of critical two - dimensional systems in system with boundaries ( surface critical behavior ) , it found applications to open - string theory ( d - branes ) , quantum impurity problems @xcite , quantum out - of - equilibrium studies ( quantum quenches @xcite ) just to cite a few . furthermore , it attracted a large attention from the mathematical community for the recent developments of stochastic loewner evolution @xcite .    in view of the connection between mera and cft , it is natural to wonder whether the mera tensor - network can be employed to study quantum systems with boundaries . in this work",
    "we introduce and analyze an entanglement renormalization tensor - network design which takes into account the presence of a ( critical ) boundary , and we study its properties .",
    "this is implemented by allowing the edge spin at the boundary of the system to interact at each step with an _ ancillary _ element , describing a fictitious degree of freedom .",
    "similarly to refs .",
    "@xcite , we will focus on homogeneous configurations , where tensor elements of the same class are also identical to each other .",
    "interestingly enough this ansatz is able to capture some important properties predicted by boundary cft .",
    "specifically , we show that the critical exponent associated to the decay of any one - point function ( as function of the distance from the boundary ) is always half of the one of the bulk two - point correlation function corresponding to the same scaling operator .",
    "we also compute the boundary corrections to the ground state energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ans ] we introduce the tensor network and its main properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ex ] we discuss how the expectation values of local observable can be computed . assuming a uniform tensor structure , in the thermodynamic limit , these expectation values decay as power law .",
    "we relate the associated critical exponents to those of the corresponding two - point correlations in the bulk . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tra ] we discuss the boundary corrections to the ground state energy .",
    "the conclusions of our work are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "consider a 1d lattice of @xmath0 spins ( sites ) , of a given local dimension @xmath1 , with open boundary conditions .",
    "a generic pure state of such system can be expressed as @xmath2 with @xmath3 a canonical basis for the single qudit and @xmath4 a type-@xmath5 tensor . following the prescriptions of the mera structure  @xcite , we assume a formal decomposition of @xmath4 which is schematically sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : chibera ] .",
    "here we use the standard graphical convention ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) for which each node of the graph represents a tensor ( the emerging legs of the node being its indices ) , while a link connecting any two nodes represents the contraction of the corresponding indices .",
    "the yellow element on the top of the figure describes a type-@xmath6 tensor @xmath7 of elements @xmath8 , that we can call _ hat _ tensor .",
    "the green triangles represent instead the same @xmath9 renormalizer tensor @xmath10 of type-@xmath11 of elements @xmath12 , and the blue circular elements represent the same @xmath13 disentangler tensor @xmath14 of type-@xmath15 of elements @xmath16 .    at the boundary ,",
    "we introduce extra tensors that couple the sites at the border with an ancillary degree of freedom represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : chibera ] by the thick grey strip .",
    "these new elements form the lateral edges of the network and describe the boundary at each level of the mera , i.e. at each level of the renormalization flow .",
    "as shown in the figure , each of them can be viewed as a matrix product state ( yellow squares ) whose bonding dimensions coincide with the coordinate space of the ancillas , which is coupled to the bulk via local coupling - elements ( drawn as magenta crescent - moons in the figure ) . via purification , we can always choose the dimension of such ancilla to be large enough so that the resulting interaction is described by a unitary operator , that we indicate as @xmath17 , a type-@xmath15 tensor of elements @xmath18 .",
    "similarly to the case of the @xmath10s and of the @xmath14s , we will also assume these elements to be uniform in the network ( possibly allowing the ones on the left - hand - side of the structure to differ from the ones on the right - hand - side @xcite ) .",
    "as customary with mera - like configurations , to enforce efficient evaluation of local observables and correlation functions , the various elements of the network are assumed to obey specific contraction rules ( a detailed analysis of the efficiency requirements for mera can be found in refs .",
    "in particular the renormalizers and the disentanglers obey isometric and unitary constraints respectively , i.e. @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the kronecker delta , while @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the adjoint counterparts of the @xmath10 and @xmath14 tensors respectively , obtained by exchanging their lower and upper indices and taking the complex conjugate .",
    "similar conditions are imposed also for the edge tensors @xmath23 these rules are graphically represented in fig .  [ fig : rulez ] . finally to ensure proper state normalization ,",
    "the tensor @xmath7 is supposed to satisfy the identity @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth noticing that , by simply re - arranging the various tensorial components , an entanglement renormalization configuration which differs from the one given in fig .",
    "[ fig : chibera ] can be obtained .",
    "in fact , the ancilla interaction tensors @xmath17 ( the magenta crescents ) can be applied at the same level of the disentanglers , instead of the renormalizers ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chibera ] right panel ) . despite their different appearance",
    ", it can be shown that these two structures are formally equivalent to each other .",
    "this can be verified by grouping together the edge - ancilla interaction with the nearest linked element belonging to the lower half - level .",
    "now , by just performing a polar decomposition  @xcite , we obtain a structure of the opposite type ( although , the very first spin of the chain is now taken out the system and put into the ancilla , while the second one becomes the edge spin ) .",
    "having acknowledged this equivalence , in the rest of the paper we will work with the structure of the left panel of fig .",

    "the first two schemes correspond to the the contractions of eq .",
    "( [ ffd ] ) , while the last one represents the unitary constraint for the edge elements of the tensor . ]",
    "in the presence of the boundary , the average of any local observable depends on the distance from the boundary itself . for a one - dimensional critical system ,",
    "the case we consider here , the space - dependence will be a power - law characterized by a set of critical exponents . in this section",
    "we show how to compute local averages and how to extract these exponents .",

    "[ fig : chibera ] , each sharing the same structural elements ( renormalizer , disentangler , edge - ancilla interaction , hat ) . for such family",
    "we want to calculate the expectation value of a general observable acting on a small group of neighboring sites located at a given distance from the closest edge of the system , say the left one . for instance , in the case of a three - sited observable @xmath27 acting on the sites @xmath28 , and @xmath29  @xcite we have @xmath30,\\ ] ] where the site indices are counted starting from the leftmost spin as the first one , and where @xmath31 is the reduced density matrix of @xmath26 associated with the selected spins .",
    "we assume a uniform mera structure .",
    "this assumption may seem an over - simplification for a system which is not translational invariant , but it turns out that it naturally accounts for the underlying ( boundary ) conformal invariance . from the locality requirements imposed in fig .",
    "[ fig : rulez ] , it is straightforward to verify that for all @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the following recursion rules apply : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath35 are 3-sites reduced density matrices of @xmath36 . in these expressions ,",

    "correspondingly the network depth decreases linearly . upon reaching the boundary one has to define further operations : @xmath39 where @xmath40 refers to the degree of freedom belonging to the ancillary system , and @xmath41 is again a cpt map , sketched in fig .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath58 is mixing ( which is a reasonable assumption  @xcite ) then its spectrum admits a unique eigenvector ( the fix point @xmath62 of the channel ) associated with @xmath63 ; all the remaining eigenvalues have modulus strictly smaller than @xmath64 . under these circumstances , in the limit of large distance from the boundary , the quantity @xmath65 converges toward its bulk limit which is obtained by computing the expectation value of @xmath66 on the fix point of the channel , i.e. @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "the deviations from such limiting expression can be evaluated by keeping the largest contribution associated with the terms with @xmath68 .",

    "the above expressions show that the quantities @xmath75 play the role of the critical exponents of the system .",
    "it is now evident that these critical exponents are the half of the corresponding ones for two - point correlation functions computed in the bulk , a well - known result in conformal field theory @xcite .",

    "this equation shows the contributions of both bulk and edge terms ; nevertheless , when we approach the thermodynamical limit @xmath98 , the contribution of the first two terms vanishes in every norm , because any density matrix has trace norm bounded by one and cpt maps are contractive .",
    "this means that the extensive influence of the boundary upon the lattice grows _ slower _ than the size of the system , a physical sounding and known property . to quantitatively describe such behavior ,",

    "as expected , the result diverges for @xmath103 since the series is made of terms growing in trace norm . to explicitly estimate how this quantity _ deviates _ from its corresponding value in the bulk",

    "this will happen when @xmath110 has null component over any generalized eigenspace whose @xmath111 .",
    "interestingly enough the capability of such deviation to diverge is another manifestation that the mera states of fig .",
    "[ fig : chibera ] are critical : indeed only the integral of a power - law function can diverge , while for an exponential decaying correlation function the integral of the corresponding action is always finite .",
    "in this paper we exploited the properties of mera to describe boundary critical phenomena .",
    "we considered the case of a one - dimensional critical system with a boundary . to this end",
    "we modified the local structure of the mera at the boundary to account for more flexibility in its description .    besides showing how to compute local observables , we achieved two main results .",
    "first of all we showed , as predicted by boundary conformal field theory , that the critical exponents associated to the decay of the one - point function ( as a function of the distance from the boundary ) is always half of the one of the bulk two - point correlation function corresponding to the same scaling operator . secondly we compute the boundary corrections to the ground state energy and determined its scaling behavior . as in the bulk case ,",
    "also in the presence of the boundary , most of the critical properties are determined solely by the eigenvalues of the mera transfer matrix .",
    "a remarkable feature of treating boundary critical phenomena with meras is that it is enough to consider uniform tensor network .",
    "this is the result of the scale invariance of the underlying tensor network which holds also in the presence of boundaries .",
    "in addition to the practical advantage in the numerical simulations , this observation further clarifies the properties of the mera .",
    "it is worth noticing that such property ( that is at the basis of the effectiveness of a bounded mera ) is physically equivalent to the fact that , in boundary critical phenomena , the operator content of the bulk is not influenced by the boundary @xcite , suggesting that maybe the connection between mera and general renormalization group theory is deeper than what nowadays understood .",
    "one dimensional systems display the peculiar feature that the boundary can be critical only when also the bulk is .",
    "this is not the case in higher dimensions @xcite , where we can have a critical boundary in a gapped system , resulting in a richer scenario for the boundary - bulk phase diagram .",
    "this richness will reflect in the possibility to have different compositions of tensor structure . in this paper we considered a matrix product state ( at the border )",
    "connected to a mera .",
    "it is easy to imagine that , to describe critical surfaces in a non - critical bulk , different compositions of tensor networks are required .",
