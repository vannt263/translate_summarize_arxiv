    "* ) , since the pioneering investigation of @xcite in the context of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogony .",
    "a very interesting contrast is drawn between the observationally based inference of simple large disk galaxies possibly giving rise to dlas @xcite and the more naturally expected hierarchical buildup of structures in the cdm cosmogony where galactic subunits may produce some of the observed kinematics of dlas @xcite .",
    "clearly , the implications on the evolution of galaxies in the two scenarios are very different .",
    "we have carried out a set of eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations with a resolution of @xmath10kpc proper and a sample size of several thousand galaxies with mass @xmath11 to statistically address the physical nature of dlas in the current standard cosmological constant - dominated cdm model ( lcdm ) @xcite .",
    "mechanical feedback from star formation driven by supernova explosions and stellar winds is modeled by a one - parameter prescription that is physically and energetically sound .",
    "part of the motivation was to complement and cross - check studies to date that are largely based on smooth - particle - hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations . with the simulation set and detailed analysis performed here this study represents a significant extension of previous works to simultaneously subject the lcdm model to a wider and more complete range of comparisons with observations .",
    "we examine in detail the following properties of dlas in a self - consistent fashion within the same model : dla column density distribution evolution , line density evolution , metallicity distribution evolution , size distribution evolution , velocity width distribution evolution , kinematic structural parameters evolution , neutral mass content evolution and others .",
    "a gallery of dlas is presented to obtain a visual understanding of the physical richness of dla systems , especially the effects of galactic winds and large - scale gaseous structures . in comparison to the recent work of",
    "@xcite we track the metallicity distribution and evolution explicitly and show that the metallicity distribution of dlas is , in good agreement with observations , very wide , which itself calls for a self - consistent treatment of metals transport . in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite ,",
    "although not in the detailed process , we show that galactic winds are _ directly _ responsible for a large fraction of wide dlas at high redshift , by entraining cold clouds to large velocities and causing large kinematic velocity widths .",
    "we find that the simulated @xmath121808 line velocity width , kinematic shape measures and dla metallicity distributions that are all in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "taking all together , we conclude that the standard lcdm model gives a satisfactory account of all properties of dlas . finally , we examine the properties of dla hosts , including their mass , star formation rate , hi content , gas to stellar mass ratio and colors , and show that dlas arise in a variety of galaxies and roughly trace the entire population of galaxies at any redshift .",
    "this may reconcile many apparently conflicting observational evidence of identifying dlas with different galaxy populations . specifically , at @xmath13 we show that @xmath14 of dlas are lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite , while the majority arise in smaller galaxies .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we detail our simulations , method of making galaxy catalogs , method of making dla catalogs and procedure of defining line profile shape measures .",
    "results are presented in  3 . in ",
    "3.1 we present a gallery of twelve dlas .",
    "we give line velocity width distribution functions in  3.2 , demonstrating excellent agreement between simulations and observations , particularly at high velocity width end .",
    " 3.3 is devoted to the three kinematic measures of the absorption line and we show the model produces results that are consistent with observations . column density distribution and evolution , line density and neutral gas density evolution are described in  3.4 , where , while simulations are consistent with observations , we emphasize large cosmic variance from region to region with different large - scale overdensities .",
    "the focus is shifted to metallicity distribution and evolution in  3.5 and simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with observations where comparisons can be made . the next subsection  3.6 performs a detailed analysis of the size of dlas and finds that the available observed qso pairs with dlas are in accord with the expectation of our model . having found agreement between simulations and observations in all aspects pertinent to dlas , we turn our attention to the properties of dla hosts in  3.7 , where we show that dlas , while slightly favoring galaxies that are more gas rich , less massive and bluer in color , and have higher hi mass and higher gas to stellar mass ratio , roughly trace the entire population of galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "conclusions are given in  4 .",
    "we perform cosmological simulations with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) eulerian hydro code , enzo @xcite .",
    "first we ran a low resolution simulation with a periodic box of @xmath15mpc on a side .",
    "we identified two regions separately , one centered on a cluster of mass of @xmath16 and the other centered on a void region at @xmath6 .",
    "we then resimulate each of the two regions separately with high resolution , but embedded in the outer @xmath17mpc box to properly take into account large - scale tidal field and appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the refined region .",
    "we name the simulation centered on the cluster ",
    "c \" run and the one centered on the void  v \" run .",
    "the refined region for  c \" run has a size of @xmath18mpc@xmath19 and that for  v \" run is @xmath20mpc@xmath19 . at their respective volumes , they represent @xmath21 and @xmath22 fluctuations .",
    "the initial condition in the refined region has a mean interparticle - separation of @xmath23kpc comoving , dark matter particle mass of @xmath24 .",
    "the refined region is surrounded by two layers ( each of @xmath25mpc ) of buffer zones with particle masses successively larger by a factor of @xmath26 for each layer , which then connects with the outer root grid that has a dark matter particle mass @xmath27 times that in the refined region . because we still can not run a very large volume simulation with adequate resolution and physics",
    ", we choose these two runs to represent two opposite environments that possibly bracket the average . at redshift @xmath28 , as we will show , the average properties of most quantities concerning dlas in  c \" and  v \" runs are not very different , although the abundances of dlas in the two runs are already very different .",
    "it is only at lower redshift where we see significant divergence of some quantities of dlas between the two runs , presumably due to different dynamic evolutions in the two runs .",
    "we choose the mesh refinement criterion such that the resolution is always better than @xmath29pc physical , corresponding to a maximum mesh refinement level of @xmath30 at @xmath6 .",
    "we also ran an additional simulation for  c \" run with a factor of two lower resolution to assess the convergence of the results which we name ",
    "c/2 \" run and , as we will show in the appendix , the convergence is excellent for all quantities examined here .",
    "the simulations include a metagalactic uv background @xcite , and a model for shielding of uv radiation by neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "they also include metallicity - dependent radiative cooling @xcite .",
    "star particles are created in cells that satisfy a set of criteria for star formation proposed by @xcite .",
    "each star particle is tagged with its initial mass , creation time , and metallicity ; star particles typically have masses of @xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "supernova feedback from star formation is modeled following @xcite .",
    "feedback energy and ejected metal - enriched mass are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at the star particle in question , weighted by the specific volume of each cell , which is to mimic the physical process of supernova blastwave propagation that tends to channel energy , momentum and mass into the least dense regions ( with the least resistance and cooling ) .",
    "we allow the whole feedback processes to be hydrodynamically coupled to surroundings and subject to relevant physical processes , such as cooling and heating , as in nature .",
    "as we will show later , the extremely inhomogeneous metal enrichment process demands that both metals and energy ( and momentum ) are correctly modeled so that they are transported into right directions in a physically sound ( albeit still approximate at the current resolution ) way .",
    "the primary advantages of this supernova energy based feedback mechanism are three - fold .",
    "first , nature does drive winds in this way and energy input is realistic .",
    "second , it has only one free parameter @xmath33 , namely , the fraction of the rest mass energy of stars formed that is deposited as thermal energy on the cell scale at the location of supernovae .",
    "third , the processes are treated physically , obeying their respective conservation laws ( where they apply ) , allowing transport of metals , mass , energy and momentum to be treated self - consistently and taking into account relevant heating / cooling processes at all times .",
    "we use @xmath34 in these simulations . the total amount of explosion kinetic energy from type ii supernovae with a chabrier imf translates to @xmath35",
    ". observations of local starburst galaxies indicate that nearly all of the star formation produced kinetic energy ( due to type ii supernovae ) is used to power gsw ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the uncertainties on the evolution of imf with redshift ( i.e. , possibly more top heavy at higher redshift ) and the fact that newly discovered prompt type i supernovae contribute a comparable amount of energy compared to type ii supernovae , it seems that our adopted value for @xmath33 is consistent with observations and within physical plausibility .",
    "we use the following cosmological parameters that are consistent with the wmap7-normalized @xcite lcdm model : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "convergence test of results are presented separately in appendix a in order not to disrupt the flow of the presentation in the results section .",
    "the tests show that our results are quite converged and should be robust at the accuracies concerned here , suggesting that our resolution has reached an adequate level for the present study .",
    "the reader may go to the appendix any time to gauge the convergence of relevant computed quantities .",
    "the fact that most of the contributions to dla incidence come from galaxies of mass @xmath42 that are well above our resolution , the results of our convergence tests are self - consistent .",
    "we identify galaxies in our high resolution simulations using the hop algorithm @xcite , operated on the stellar particles , which is tested to be robust and insensitive to specific choices of concerned parameters within reasonable ranges .",
    "satellites within a galaxy are clearly identified separately .",
    "the luminosity of each stellar particle at each of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) five bands is computed using the gissel stellar synthesis code @xcite , by supplying the formation time , metallicity and stellar mass .",
    "collecting luminosity and other quantities of member stellar particles , gas cells and dark matter particles yields the following physical parameters for each galaxy : position , velocity , total mass , stellar mass , gas mass , mean formation time , mean stellar metallicity , mean gas metallicity , star formation rate , luminosities in five sdss bands ( and various colors ) and others .",
    "while our simulations also solve relevant gas chemistry chains for molecular hydrogen formation @xcite , molecular formation on dust grains @xcite and metal cooling extended down to @xmath43k @xcite , at the resolution of the simulations , molecular clouds are not properly modeled . to correct for that",
    ", we use the @xcite observation that at @xmath44hi / cm@xmath19 2 fraction is about 50% and then implement the following prescription to remove neutral gas in extrapolated high density regions and put it in 2 phase . in detail , we assume that the density profile is isothermal below our resolution , which would translate the fraction of mass in 2 is @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we post - process the neutral neutral density in the simulation by the following transformation : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is",
    "the hi density directly from the simulation , and @xmath49 is that after this processing step .",
    "a very precise choice of the parameter in the above equation is unimportant ; changing @xmath50 to @xmath51 makes marginally noticeable differences in the results .",
    "the primary effect of doing this is to remove very high hi column dlas and causes the hi column density distribution function to steepen at @xmath52 , in agreement with observations .",
    "in addition , because of that , the total amount of neutral gas in dlas also become convergent and more stable .    after the above post - process step ,",
    "we shoot rays through the entire refined region of each simulation along all three orthogonal directions using a cell size of @xmath53kpc comoving . in practice , this is done piece - wise , one small volume of the simulation box at a time , due to limited computer memory .",
    "the spectral bin size is @xmath54km / s .",
    "all physical effects are taken into account , including temperature broadening and peculiar velocities .",
    "both intrinsic lorentzian line profile and doppler broadening are taken into account for both @xmath9 and @xmath121808 line , although , in practice , for dlas , doppler broadening is important for @xmath121808 line and lorentzian profile for @xmath9 line .",
    "all relevant atomic data are taken from @xcite .",
    "a dla is defined , as usual , a system with hi column larger than @xmath55@xmath56 .",
    "we assume that the fractional abundance of is equal to fractional abundance of hi .",
    "since , as we will see later , the hi regions of dlas are  peaky \" with well - defined line - of - sight boundaries and since dlas are very optically opaque to ionizing photons , any refined treatment of radiative self - shielding etc is unlikely to have any significant effect .",
    "note that we have already included a crude self - shielding method during the simulation , which should work well for optically opaque regions .",
    "as a side , one numerical point to note is that , because of the very large dynamic range of both line cross sections as a function of frequency shift from the line center and the delta function like cross section shapes in the line core regions , the convolution operations involved in the detailed calculations of optical depths require at least @xmath57bits precision for floating point numbers .    for each dla , we compute the hi column weighted metallicity , register its position relative to the center of the primary galaxy ( i.e , the impact parameter ) , and for dlas that are physically connected by at least one cell side in projection we merge them and in the end compute projected area @xmath58 of each connected region to define it size @xmath59 . for each galaxy",
    "we also register the maximum velocity width @xmath60 among its associated dlas .",
    "we are able to identify more than one million dlas through ray tracing at each redshift examined in each of the runs .",
    "so the statistical errors are very small for each specific run at any redshift .",
    "but that does not speak to cosmic variance and as we shall show later , cosmic variance is indeed quite large concerning quantities that directly or indirectly pertain to the number density of dlas .",
    "other quantities , such as size , metallicity , kinematic properties , etc .",
    ", however , appear to depend weakly on environments and their variances are small .",
    "a dla  belongs \" to the largest galaxy in the region , within whose virial radius the dla lies .",
    "for example , a dla that is physically more closely located to a satellite galaxy that in turn is within the virial radius of a larger galaxy is said to belong to that larger galaxy .",
    "we do not add instrumental noise to the simulated spectra , but we adopt the same observational procedure to compute the kinematic measures for the absorption lines . for all relevant measures for the line ,",
    "we follow identically the procedures and definitions in @xcite .",
    "we generate synthetic spectra for both @xmath9 and line with @xmath54km / s pixels and then smooth it with a 9-pixel boxcar averaging procedure .",
    "we define the velocity width of a absorption line associated with a dla to be the velocity interval of 90% of the total optical depth , @xmath61 . for the three kinematic shape measures for line we use all intensity troughs ( optical depth peaks ) without the @xmath62 constraint , where @xmath63 is the continuum flux , as re - emphasized by @xcite .",
    "the kinematic shape measures , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , are defined exactly the same way as in @xcite .",
    "cm cm    cm cm    cm cm    cm cm    we first present a gallery of twelve dlas at @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig : pic2]-[fig : pica7 ] ) to show the richness of their physical properties . for each dla",
    "six maps and five quantitative panels are displayed . in each of the six maps the line of sight ( los ) intercepting the dla",
    "is shown as a white horizontal line and the exact location of the primary component of the dla is at the intersection with another , white vertical line . in cases with multiple components along the los ,",
    "the primary component coincides with the highest neutral density .",
    "four of the maps - top left ( temperature in kelvin ) , middle left ( atomic hydrogen density in @xmath68 ) , bottom left ( metallicity in solar units ) and top middle ( pressure in units of kelvin @xmath68 ) - have a physical thickness of @xmath69kpc . also indicated in top middle ( pressure ) is the peculiar velocity field with a scaling of @xmath70kpc corresponding to @xmath71km / s .",
    "the remaining two maps - middle middle ( baryonic overdensity ) and bottom middle ( stellar surface density in @xmath72/kpc@xmath73 ) - are projected over the entire galaxy of depth of order of the virial diameter of the primary galaxy . while these two projected maps give an overall indication of relative projected location of the dla respect to the galaxy , the exact depth of the dla inside the paper is , however ,",
    "not shown . when we quote distance from the galaxy , we mean the projected distance on the paper plane .",
    "the five panels on the right column show various physical quantities along the line of sight ( i.e , along the white horizontal line shown in the maps on the left two columns ) . from top to bottom they are : atomic hydrogen density ( in @xmath68 ; red solid curve with a narrower shape ) along with total hydrogen density ( dotted green curve with a more extended shape ) , gas metallicity ( in solar units ) , line - of - sight proper peculiar velocity ( in km / s ) , @xmath9 flux and flux for @xmath121808 line .",
    "the top three panels are plotted against physical distance , whereas the bottom two panels are plotted versus the los velocity .",
    "also indicated in the @xmath9 flux panel ( second from bottom ) are several quantitative measures of the dla , including the neutral hydrogen column density ( @xmath74 n(hi ) ) , the halo mass of the primary galaxy in the system ( @xmath75 ) , the velocity width of the associated line ( @xmath61 ) and three kinetic measures of the line , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "we now describe in turn each of the twelve dla examples .",
    "figure  [ fig : pic2 ] shows a dla produced by the los intersecting the tip of a long chimney at a distance of @xmath76kpc , the velocity structure suggests that it is still moving away ( upwards ) from the galaxy at a velocity of @xmath77km / s , likely caused by galactic winds .",
    "the metallicity at the interception is @xmath3\\sim -1.5 $ ] but there are large gradients and variations of metallicity ( we found that some other very nearby dla systems intersecting different parts of the chimney have metallicity @xmath3<-3 $ ] , not shown ) , suggesting very inhomogeneous enrichment process by galactic winds .",
    "while the primary galaxy has a mass of @xmath78 , i.e. , a 1-d velocity dispersion of @xmath71km / s , the kinetic width of this line is only @xmath79km / s with @xmath80 .",
    "although the @xmath9 flux appears as a single component , as will be the case in all subsequent examples , the absorption has several separate features , reflecting the two - peak structure of the absorbing column and complex velocity structure within .",
    "we note that the nearby satellite galaxies may have triggered the starburst and the galactic winds . the responsible gas for this dla is probably cooling and confined by external pressure likely due to thermal instability , as seen in the pressure panel .",
    "cm cm    cm cm    cm cm    cm cm    in figure  [ fig : pic3 ] a dla of width @xmath81km / s is created jointly by two major components along the sightline , one at @xmath82kpc of metallicity of @xmath3\\sim [ -1.0 , -0.5]$ ] and size of @xmath83kpc at an impact parameter of @xmath76kpc and the other at @xmath84kpc of metallicity of @xmath3\\sim 0.0 $ ] and size of @xmath76kpc .",
    "what is striking is many long gaseous structures in this galaxy . as we will see frequently , there are often long gaseous structures connected with galaxies that seem always coincidental with visible galaxy interactions of multiple galaxies or galaxies and satellites in close proximity .",
    "we shall call these features  galactic filaments \" hereafter .",
    "it seems likely that some of these galactic filaments are cold streams @xcite . however ,",
    "galactic filaments found in our simulations appear to be very rich in variety and disparate in metallicity ( spanning 3 decades or more in metallicity ) . in other words",
    ", they are not necessarily primordial cold streams . in the case of this dla",
    ", the filaments are likely made of gas pre - enriched , having cooled ( as the pressure panel shows ) and now rotating about the galaxy ( roughly counter - clockwise ) .",
    "in contrast , note that the dla in figure  [ fig : pic2 ] was still moving away from the galaxy .",
    "like in figure  [ fig : pic2 ] , the rich galactic filaments appear to be associated with significant satellite structures in close proximity .",
    "the absorption has several separate features , reflecting the two separate physical components as well as substructures within each component .",
    "cm cm    figure  [ fig : pic5 ] shows a dla that is associated with a low metallicity ( @xmath3\\sim [ -2.0 , -1.5]$ ] ) filament that is feeding a small satellite , which in turn appears to be interacting and possibly feeding the primary galaxy at a projected distance of @xmath83kpc .",
    "this is yet another example of interacting galaxies producing rich gas - feeding filaments , as already seen in figures  [ fig : pic2 ] and [ fig : pic3 ] .",
    "the relatively large width of @xmath85km / s is produced by steep velocity gradient in the region from @xmath86 to @xmath87kpc .",
    "one could see that galactic winds are blowing to the upper left corner by the primary galaxy , whose starburst is likely triggered by the interaction .",
    "cm cm    figure  [ fig : pic7 ] shows a dla that is made up by several filaments at distances of @xmath88kpc from the galaxy .",
    "the metallicity of all the components is near solar , indicating that these are probably pre - enriched gas cooling due to thermal instability .",
    "the velocity structures show that they are falling back towards the galaxy , in a fashion perhaps similar to galactic fountains @xcite , on somewhat extended scales .",
    "once again , it appears that galaxy - galaxy interactions may be responsible for the rich gas filaments , as seen in figures   [ fig : pic2 ] , [ fig : pic3 ] and [ fig : pic5 ] .",
    "there is evidence that winds are blowing upwards from the galaxy .",
    "cm cm    figure  [ fig : pic8 ] shows another example of a dla arising from a galaxy with a very rich filament system due to galaxy interactions .",
    "the primary galaxy is the same as the one shown in figure  [ fig : pic3 ] and we are now looking at its south side .",
    "these filaments that are responsible for the neutral column of the dla appear to have been enriched to a level of @xmath3\\sim -1.0 $ ] and have cooled to low temperature .",
    "the large width of @xmath89km / s is due to the multiple components spanning a spatial range of @xmath90kpc each of physical depth of several kpc and individual velocity width @xmath91km / s .",
    "interestingly , for this dla system , while most of the gas filaments are now falling back toward the galaxy ( not necessarily radially ) , galactic winds are still blowing towards the upper right corner .",
    "comparison of figure  [ fig : pic8 ] and figure  [ fig : pic3 ] indicates that the metallicity in the upper right quadrant of the galaxy is somewhat more metal enriched ( @xmath3\\sim 0 $ ] ) than other regions ( @xmath3\\sim -1 $ ] or lower ) , consistent with the directions of ongoing galactic winds .",
    "this is strongly suggestive that metallicity enrichment process not only is episodic , multi - generational , anisotropic , but also in general possesses no parity .",
    "cm cm    figure  [ fig : pic9 ] shows a dla intercepting two filaments at a small inclined angle , giving rise to a broad physical extension of @xmath92kpc .",
    "all the visible filaments appear to run roughly top - left to bottom - right , whereas the metal enriched regions seem to spread out like a butterfly in the direction roughly perpendicular to the filaments .",
    "this is the classic picture that galactic winds tend to blow in directions that are perpendicular to the filaments that are feeding the galaxy .",
    "the inner regions of the filaments appear to be less enriched ( @xmath3\\sim -2 $ ] ) than the outer regions of the filaments ( @xmath3\\sim [ -0.5 , 0]$ ] ) , strongly indicative of galactic winds tending to circumvent the denser filaments .",
    "the large width of @xmath93km / s appears to be caused by oppositely moving ( i.e. , converging ) flows at @xmath94kpc , probably caused by the bipolar winds interacting with the complex filament structures .",
    "this galaxy has a mass of @xmath95 and we notice that most of its surrounding regions is relatively cold , whereas in figures  ( [ fig : pic2]-[fig : pic8 ] ) we consistently see a hot atmosphere permeating the circumgalactic regions .",
    "the galaxies in figures  ( [ fig : pic2]-[fig : pic8 ] ) all have mass @xmath96 , consistent with the mass demarcation of cold and hot accretion modes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of cold galactic filaments seen in figures  ( [ fig : pic2]-[fig : pic8 ] ) is consistent with the suggested cold mode of accretion of massive galaxies at high redshift @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pic10 ] shows a  normal \" dla where a relatively quiet galactic disk is pierced edge - on .",
    "its large width of @xmath97km / s is simply due to the large halo that the galaxy is residing in of mass @xmath98 ( at @xmath67 ) .",
    "the surrounding environment seems relatively  pristine \" with no widespread metal enrichment at a level of @xmath3\\ge -1 $ ] .",
    "however , the temperature panel indicates that there is a hot halo permeating the entire region and embedding and pressure - confining ( see the pressure panel ) the cold neutral clouds .",
    "it seems likely that this hot gaseous halo is produced by gravitational shocks rather than galactic wind shocks .",
    "there are several filaments attached to the galaxy .",
    "this is a good example of cold streams feeding a massive galaxy by penetrating a hot atmosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : pica3 ] shows a dla with a large velocity width arising from a relatively small galaxy of total mass @xmath99 .",
    "the galactic winds are blowing in the north - east direction that entrain cold neutral clouds with it .",
    "the los of the dla intercepts a high velocity component at @xmath100kpc .",
    "the combination of this high velocity component with the low velocity component at @xmath101 produces the relatively large width of @xmath102km / s .",
    "note that an isotropic maxwellian velocity distribution of dispersion equal to that of the halo velocity dispersion would only yield a width of @xmath103km / s .",
    "clearly , galactic winds are directly responsible for the large width of this dla , by entraining cold gas clouds to a high velocity .",
    "figure  [ fig : pica4 ] shows another dla produced by a small galaxy of mass @xmath104 with a large velocity width .",
    "the galaxy system have multiple , interaction galaxies at close distances .",
    "the galactic winds are blowing primarily , in a bipolar fashion , in north - east and south - west direction , roughly perpendicular to the galactic disk , that entrain the cold neutral cloud at @xmath105kpc to a broad velocity of @xmath106km / s relative to the galaxy itself .",
    "in combination with another complex structure at @xmath107kpc the galactic winds produce a very large width of @xmath108km / s .",
    "note that for this galaxy @xmath109km / s .",
    "figure  [ fig : pica5 ] shows yet another dla arising from a small galaxy but having a large velocity width of @xmath110km / s .",
    "this is an interesting case where the galactic winds are blowing , by the primary galaxy , towards and passing through the satellite galaxy at @xmath111kpc in the north - east direction .",
    "the sdss u band luminosity map suggests that the satellite galaxy itself is experiencing a starburst and likely blowing and enhancing the north - east / north winds .",
    "a very large positive velocity gradient in the positive x - direction ( downstream ) of @xmath112km / s over an los physical interval of @xmath113kpc is produced , resulting in a very large width .",
    "note that @xmath114km / s for this galaxy .",
    "the entrained neutral gas cloud and its downstream appear to have escaped the metal enrichment by ongoing winds and remain at @xmath3\\sim -1 $ ] -  shadowing \" effect due to dense clouds and filaments .    figure  [ fig : pica6 ] shows another wide dla from a small galaxy . for this dla",
    "the majority of the column is due to the intersection with the disk of the galaxy , which would have produced a velocity width of @xmath115km / s on its own .",
    "the galactic winds blowing at the south - east direction entrain some cold clouds at @xmath116kpc to a velocity up to @xmath71km / s .",
    "together , a large width of @xmath110km / s is produced .",
    "given the small mass of the galaxy the surrounding regions are not embedded in a hot gravitationally shock heated atmosphere .",
    "there are some solid angles with low gas column that have been heated by galactic winds , probably triggered by the binary galaxy interaction , as can be seen by comparing temperature map and the density map .",
    "note that @xmath117km / s for this galaxy .    finally , figure  [ fig : pica7 ] shows the last example of a wide dla from a small galaxy .",
    "two galactic filaments make up this dla , one at @xmath118kpc and the other at @xmath119kpc .",
    "the galactic system is a primary - satellite binary that is interacting , which has likely caused both to experience starbursts .",
    "the primary galaxy at @xmath120kpc is blowing bipolar galactic winds mainly in the north - south direction , whereas the satellite at @xmath121kpc is blowing bipolar galactic winds in the east - west direction .",
    "together they produce a very complex , multi - stream velocity structure .",
    "the total velocity width of this dla is @xmath71km / s , although each of the two components individually has a velocity width of @xmath122km / s .",
    "note that @xmath123km / s for the primary galaxy .    in summary , we see that dlas arise in a wide variety of cold gas clouds , from galactic disks to cold streams to cooling gas from galactic winds to cold clouds entrained by hot galactic winds at a wide range of distances from galaxies , with a wide range of metallicity and in galaxies of all masses from @xmath124 at @xmath13",
    ". inspection of the gallery has already hinted that many large velocity width dlas may be produced directly or indirectly by galactic winds .",
    "that is , directly by entraining cold gas clouds and compressing cold gas clouds with high pressure and indirectly by enhancing cooling and thermal instability with added metals and shock compression .",
    "in addition , the composite nature of many large width dla systems should also help remove the perceived failure of the standard lcdm model with respect to producing large width systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "quantitative results later prove this is indeed the case .",
    "we now present more quantitative statistical results on the velocity width distribution functions of dlas at several redshifts . since the velocity structure in @xmath9 flux of a dla is ",
    "damped \" and does not provide the kinematic information of the underlying physical cloud . following @xcite , the velocity width , @xmath61 , is defined to be the velocity interval of 90% of the optical depth of the @xmath121808 absorption line associated with the dla .",
    "figure  [ fig : v90his ] shows the velocity width distribution at three redshifts ( @xmath125 ) , covering most of the observed redshift range .",
    "we see a factor of @xmath126 variation from  c \" to  v \" run , indicating the need to have a larger statistical set of simulations covering , more densely , different environments , before a more precise comparison can be made with observations .",
    "insofaras the observed velocity width distribution function lies inbetween the two bracketing runs ,  c \" and  v \" , and the shape of the functions are in excellent agreement with observations , including the high velocity tail ( @xmath127km / s ) , this should be considered a success for the lcdm model - there is no lack of large width dlas with @xmath127km / s in the lcdm simulation .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with that of @xcite , who studied this issue with a different code and a different feedback implementation .",
    "there is a significant difference between our results and theirs in the that we find galactic winds are directly responsible for many of the large width dlas , by entraining neutral dense clouds to large velocities .",
    "in addition , they conclude that a large halo mass ( @xmath128 ) is a necessary condition for producing large velocity widths , while we find that a non - negligible fraction of large velocity width dlas arise in halos less massive than @xmath129 .    to help understand the large velocity width dlas , we plot in figure  [ fig : v90max ] the maximum @xmath61 of all dlas , @xmath60 , associated with each galaxy against the halo mass of the galaxy , @xmath130 .",
    "the black line @xmath131 is what @xmath61 would be if the velocity distribution is an isotropic and maxwellian distribution with its dispersion equal to @xmath132 , and the gas density is constant across the dla .",
    "we see that the maxwellian velocity distribution ( the black line ) approximately provides a lower bound to @xmath61 , although there is , unsurprisingly , some fraction of systems that lie below ( see figure  [ fig : pic2 ] for an example ) .",
    "what is very interesting is that at @xmath67 there is a large number of galaxies whose @xmath60 are substantially larger than what @xmath132 could produce , i.e. ,  super - gravitational motion \" in the terminology of @xcite .",
    "this super - gravitational motion is produced by galactic winds , as we have seen clearly in figures  [ fig : pica3 ] , [ fig : pica4 ] , [ fig : pica5 ] , [ fig : pica6 ] and [ fig : pica7 ] in  3.1 .",
    "we also note that at @xmath5 for both  c \" and  v \" run ( and especially the  c \" run ) , the correlation between @xmath61 and @xmath132 becomes substantially better with much reduced scatter , and the excess of dlas with large @xmath133 is much removed .",
    "this is circumstantial but strong evidence that galactic winds are responsible for most of the large @xmath133 dlas , because of higher star formation activities hence galactic winds at @xmath67 than @xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : v90maxz0 ] below will further strengthen this point .",
    "it appears that the redshift evolution at a fixed environment is relatively mild in the redshift range @xmath134 to @xmath5 .",
    "we speculate that the weak evolution of the velocity width distribution from @xmath134 to @xmath5 may be coincidental and attributable to two countering processes : growth of halo mass hence virial velocity with time and diminution of supergravitational motion produced by galactic winds with time ( due to reduced star formation activities with time at @xmath135 ) .",
    "this prediction of a weak evolution of velocity width distribution with redshift is verifiable with future larger dla sample and is a powerful test for the non - gravitational origin of a large fraction of the large width systems .",
    "-2 in    figure  [ fig : v90max ] does not , however , fairly characterize the relative contribution of halos of different masses to velocity width distribution function , because it does not specify the number of dlas at a given halo mass . in figure  [ fig : v150his ]",
    "we show the halo mass probability distribution function for dlas above three velocity width cuts , @xmath136km / s , respectively .",
    "we see a clear trend that larger halos make larger contribution to larger width dlas , as one would have expected . for example , about one half of all dlas with @xmath137km / s arise in halos of mass greater than @xmath138 at @xmath67 , whereas that division line drops to @xmath95 for @xmath139km / s .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio of the virial velocity of a halo of mass @xmath95 to that of @xmath138 is @xmath140 , significantly greater than @xmath141 , indicating an overweight of dla cross - section by large galaxies . for moderate to large velocity width of @xmath139km / s , halos of mass @xmath142 dominate the contribution to dla incidence , largely in agreement with @xcite .",
    "slightly at odds with @xcite , however , we find a significant fraction of these relative wide systems arising in galaxies of mass less than @xmath142 : @xmath143 of dlas with velocity width larger than @xmath144km / s are due to galaxies with mass less than @xmath142 .",
    "we note that our definition of associating dlas with galaxies biases associating them to larger galaxies ; figure  [ fig : pic5 ] gives an example , where the dla is defined to arise from the larger galaxy of mass @xmath145 , even though it is more closely related to a much smaller satellite galaxy that is orbiting around the larger galaxy .",
    "our results are perhaps unsurprising in the sense that one would have expected that galactic winds , when they are blowing , should be stronger , or at least not weaker , in dwarf starburst galaxies than larger galaxies thanks to shallow gravitational potential wells in the former , when cold gas is still abundant at high redshift . both figure  [ fig : v150his ] and gallery pictures in  3.1 confirm this point .",
    "galactic winds , however , could be weaker in dwarf galaxies if star formation is inproportionally less vigorous",
    ". this may be the case at lower redshift , as shown in figure  [ fig : v90maxz0 ] .",
    "what is interesting , and further evidence , is that at @xmath6 the dwarf galaxies in  v \" run appear to have more super - gravitational motion than in the  c \" run , simply because the former are gas richer and have higher star formation rate than the latter .",
    "thus , it seems that galactic winds are a bivariate function of galaxy mass and star formation rate , in a fashion that is consistent with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "more important is that , quantitatively , in order to achieve an optical depth of @xmath150 , with a width @xmath151km / s it requires a dla column of @xmath152@xmath56 , if the dla is composed of one single component with @xmath3=-1 $ ] . since the abundance of dlas with @xmath153@xmath56 declines",
    "rapidly ( see figure  [ fig : colhis ] ) but the abundance of line peaks near @xmath151km / s ( figure  [ fig : v90his ] ) , this suggests that a significant fraction of lines must have multiple components . to quantitatively illustrate this , we define a new simple two - component measure as follows .",

    "this result is also consistent with the anecdotal evidence shown in the gallery examples in  3.1 , where most of large width dlas contain more than one physical component .",
    "we now turn to the three kinematic shape measures defined in @xcite , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , representing , respectively , measures of the symmetry , leading - edgeness and two - peakness of the profile of @xmath121808 absorption lines associated with dlas ( see the bottom right panels of the gallery pictures in  3.1 ) . figures ( [ fig : fmmhis],[fig : fedgehis],[fig : f2pkhis ] ) show comparisons of simulation results with observations at three redshifts @xmath5 , @xmath67 and @xmath134 .",

    "we speculate that difference in the detailed treatments of metal transport process as well as feedback prescription between our simulations and theirs may have partly contributed to this difference ; with detailed metal transport we find very inhomogeneous metallicity distributions across space and among dlas in our simulations ( see figure [ fig : mtlhis ] below ) , whereas they assume a constant metallicity of @xmath3=-1 $ ] for all dlas .",
    "it is also noted that the metallicity distributions of our simulations at redshift range @xmath161 are in excellent agreement with observations ( figure  [ fig : mtlhis ] ) . at the bottom - right panels of each four - panel set in figures ( [ fig : fmmhis],[fig : fedgehis],[fig : f2pkhis ] ) we show a comparison between @xmath5 and @xmath67 distributions for each of the shape statistics and find that there is significant evolution in all three shape measures .",

    "-0.5 cm    let us now address the fundamentally important observable : the column density distribution of dlas and its evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : colhis ] shows the column density distribution at several redshifts from @xmath6 to @xmath163 .",
    "where comparisons can be reliably made with observations , at @xmath164 , @xmath67 and @xmath163 , we see that the overdense run  c \" and underdense run ",

    "ultimately , when pc resolution is reached , we can make more definitive tests .",
    "what is also interesting is that the variations between different environments are larger than the redshift evolution of the column density distribution in each run .",
    "it is further noted that , seen in the lower - left panel of figure  [ fig : colhis ] , the evolution of the column density distribution in  c \" and  v \" run is different . in ",
    "c \" run , we see weak evolution from @xmath163 to @xmath5 and then a relatively large drop in amplitude at @xmath6 . in",

    "what is reassuring is that the observed data lie sensibly between results from these two bracketing environments . if one assumes that the cosmic mean of each of the two plotted quantities should lie between  c \" and  v \" run , reading the range spanned by the two runs suggests that the lcdm model is likely to agree with observations to within a factor of @xmath165 with respect to both quantities ,",
    "although what the overall temporal shape will look like is difficult to guess .    to firmly quantify these important observables and to more precisely assess the agreement / disagreement between the predictions of the lcdm model and observations , a larger set of simulations sampling , more densely , different environments in a statistically correct fashion will be necessary , so is a more accurate treatment of the transition from atomic to molecular hydrogen in very high density regions ( that likely affects the shape at the high column density end ) .",
    "we reserve this for future work .",
    "-1 cm    the current set of simulations is vastly superior to those used in our earlier work addressing the observed relatively weak but non - negligible evolution of dla metallicity @xcite and here we return to this critical issue .",

    "furthermore , the absolute amount of metals is totally fixed by requiring that 25% of stellar mass with metallicity equal to @xmath167 returning to the ism , cgm and igm .",
    "the agreement indicates that our choices of both the supernova ejecta mass and its metallicity and the explosion energy , which are inspired by theories of stellar interior and direct observations , may provide a reasonable approximation of truth .",

    "thus , both simulations and nature indicate that there is a weak but real evolution in dla metallicity .",
    "what is also important to note is that , in agreement with observations , simulations indicate that the distribution of metallicity is very wide , spanning three or more decades at @xmath168 .",
    "this wide range reflects the rich variety of neutral gas that composes the dla population , from relatively pristine gas clouds falling onto or feeding galaxies , to metal - enriched cold clouds that are falling back to ( galactic fountain ) or still moving away from ( due to entrainment of galactic winds ) galaxies , to cold neutral gas clouds in galactic disks .",

    "the distribution at @xmath6 is significantly narrower , partly reflecting the overall enrichment of the igm and partly due to much reduced variety of dlas with galactic disks becoming a more dominant contributor to dlas ( see discussion below ) .",
    "@xcite find that proximate dlas ( pdlas ) , those within a velocity distance from the qso @xmath169km / s , seem to have metallicity higher than the more widely studied , intervening dlas .",
    "it seems conceivable that the total sample of pdlas plus conventional ( intervening ) dlas may somewhat shift the metallicity distribution to the right , perhaps bringing it to a still better agreement with our simulations .",
    "1.7 cm -2.5 cm    observations have found a strong positive correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we divide the simulated dla sample at @xmath67 into two subsets , one with metallicity less than @xmath3=-1 $ ] and the other more than @xmath3=-1 $ ] .",
    "we then compute the velocity width functions separately for each subset , which are shown as solid dots ( lower metallicity ) and solid squares ( higher metallicity ) in the left panel of figure  [ fig : v90hiszdiv ] .",
    "what we see is that there is a small excess of large velocity width dlas for the higher metallicity subset compared to the lower metallicity one .",
    "this is of course in the sense that is consistent with the observed metallity - mass relation .",
    "however , current observational data sample is consistent with simulations , and the difference between the two simulated subsets and between the two observed subsets is statistically insignificant . a larger sample ( by a factor of 4 ) may allow for a statistically significant test .",
    "do we expect a larger difference in the disk model @xcite ?",
    "we do not have a straight answer to this question , without a very involved modeling .",
    "however , we we suggest that the picture we have presented , where dlas arise from a variety of galactic systems , in a variety of locations of widely varying metallicity ( see the gallery in  3.1 ) , would be consistent with the small difference found , because the velocity widths of large width dlas do not strongly correlate with galaxy mass ( see figure  [ fig : v90max ] ) . in other words , the observed correlation between metallicity and galaxy mass is largely washed out by dlas that do not arise in disks and whose metallicity do not strongly correlate with galaxy mass .",
    "if one combines the information provided by figure  [ fig : v150his ] and figure  [ fig : v90hiszdiv ] , one may reach a similar conclusion .    -1 cm    the implication may be that dlas do not arise predominantly in gaseous disks of spiral galaxies at high redshift , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall elaborate further on this significant point . in figure",
    "[ fig : dishis ] we show the distribution of physical distance of dlas from the galactic center ( i.e. , impact parameter ) at four redshifts , @xmath166 .",
    "since we have shown in figure  [ fig : v150his ] that dla incidence contribution peaks at @xmath170 , let us make a simple estimate of their size at @xmath13 . as a reference ,",
    "let us take the radius of milky way ( mw ) stellar disk to be @xmath171kpc .",
    "taking mw to @xmath172 self - similarly would give a radius of @xmath173kpc and for a @xmath174 galaxy the stellar disk radius would be @xmath175kpc at @xmath172 , corresponding to @xmath176 in the shown x - axis . observed large galaxies ( of mass likely in the range @xmath177 ) at @xmath13 appear to have sizes of @xmath178kpc @xcite , roughly consistent with the simple scaling .",

    "thus , these gaseous structures occur at about half the virial radius at @xmath172 , thus , we conclude that at @xmath0 most of the dlas _ do not _ arise from large galactic stellar disks .",
    "they appear to come from regions that are @xmath181 larger than the stellar disks .",
    "the ubiquitous extended structures - galactic filaments - appear to be at the right distances of @xmath179kpc , seen in the gallery examples in  3.1 . while the extremely close association of galactic filaments with galaxy interactions suggest that the host galaxies are likely experiencing starbursts , as seen in the gallery examples , the clouds that give rise to dlas do not appear to have ongoing _ in situ _ star formation .",
    "clearly , most dlas do not arise in disks and most dlas have low metallicities , as we have shown , are self - consistent . in other words , aside from those dlas that arise from galactic disks and are metal rich , the metallicity of the vast majority of more metal poor dlas do not appear to be forming stars .",
    "it may be that , if and when the gas in the galactic filaments forms stars , either they are destroyed by star formation feedback and remove themselves from the dla category or they have already incorporated into disks of galaxies .",
    "we suggest that our model gives a natural explanation to the apparent puzzle of the lack of obvious star formation of gas - rich dlas @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inferred cooling rates of dlas may be provided , in part , by radiative heating from the host galaxy ( see figure  [ fig : sfrhis ] below ) and possibly in part by compression heating as we frequently see higher external pressure in  3.1 .",

    "we see from table 1 that the the observed qso pairs are all statistically consistent with our model at @xmath219 level or better , entirely consistent with the agreement shown in figure  [ fig : sizehis ] between the computed size distribution and observationally inferred size , which is somewhat model dependent .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : sizemtot ] , we plot the total dla cross section of each galaxy ( @xmath197 ) against its halo mass at @xmath67 ( left panel ) and @xmath6 ( right panel ) .",
    "also shown as the black line is a linear fit assuming that the effective radius @xmath196 is proportional to the virial radius for simplicity .",
    "note that a least - square linear fit is slightly flatter than the black curve .",
    "it is noted that there are a small fraction of galaxies that do not have significant neutral gas thus do not show up in the plotted range .",
    "what is most striking is that , for gas rich galaxies that give rise to dlas at @xmath67 , on average , the effective area that gives rise to dlas occupies about @xmath220 of the total area within the virial radius , i.e. , @xmath221 . by @xmath6 the effective radius has much reduced to @xmath222 , becoming comparable to the size of the stellar disk .",
    "the total dla cross section as a function of halo mass is in agreement with @xcite within a factor of @xmath54 ( ours is higher than theirs ) .",
    "we note that the method we use to compute the total dla cross section gives a correct value for the case of a thin disk but could overestimate it by a factor of @xmath198 in the case of a sphere .",
    "let us fast forward to figure  [ fig : mhalohis ] and take a note that at @xmath67 the typical halo mass for dla incidence is @xmath223 having a virial radius of @xmath224kpc , which then gives @xmath225kpc ( see above relation between @xmath226 and @xmath227 ) . from figure",
    "[ fig : dishis ] we see that the typical distance of dla from galaxy center is @xmath228kpc , thus @xmath229 .",
    "this near equality between the distance and size suggests that a large fraction of the sky seen by an object sitting in the galaxy , up to @xmath230 , may be covered by dlas !",
    "if that object is a qso , the situation may be different , because the qso , with its intense radiation ( and possibly other effects , such as winds ) , may have significantly modified its surroundings , including the nearby dlas .",
    "note that a qso proximity radius is about @xmath231mpc .",
    "the evidence we see in the gallery examples that the surge in dla incidence of a galaxy seems always associated with starbursts and in gas - rich ( probably ) spiral like galaxies , whereas qsos tend to reside in gas - poor elliptical galaxies .",
    "these two facts together suggest that it is not straight forward to estimate the fraction of qsos that have this type of proximity dlas .",
    "the situation for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may be relatively more straight forward to analyze , because grbs are associated with star formation hence likely coincides with the surge in dla cross section of interacting galaxies and because radiation from grbs does not significantly affect their surroundings at a distance of @xmath92kpc .",
    "therefore , we suggest that at high redshift @xmath232 , a significant fraction ( up to @xmath233 ) of grbs , which depends on detailed geometry / orientation of dla clouds , have associated dlas with a typical velocity difference from its systemic redshift of @xmath234km / s ( see figure  [ fig : dvgaldlahis ] below for @xmath235 ) .",
    "one complication factor is that some ( or possibly most of ) grb - dlas may be due to dense gas in the close vicinity of grbs - nearby dlas .",
    "since grbs are thought to occur in star - forming regions , i.e. , embedded in molecular clouds , one might expect to see a signicant amount of molecules associated with nearby dlas and they should be dusty and relatively more metal enriched . however ,",
    "if progenitors of grbs are biased metal poor , such as preferred in the collapsar model @xcite , then it may become more complicated , although latest observations seem to indicate otherwise ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we suggest that a subset of grb - dlas _ with little molecular hydrogen column density _ and being relatively metal poor and dust poor , such as those in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , may be identified with circumgalactic dlas proposed here .    this fraction of grbs with dlas is , however , likely to decrease rapidly towards lower redshift because of ( 1 ) smaller @xmath236 ratio and ( 2 ) a smaller fraction of dlas outside stellar disk .",
    "the unknown in the above estimate is the geometry of dlas .",
    "we will reserve a detailed analysis of this issue for a future study .",
    "so far we have presented our simulations and compare to observations of dlas in many different aspects . from these detailed comparisons",
    "we conclude that the model is consistent with all extant observations of dlas , including kinematic properties , metallicity , column density distribution , line density and neutral hydrogen density , size distribution , and their evolution , wherever comparisons could be made .",
    "proper modeling of galactic winds along with high numerical resolution seems to have contributed to the success .",
    "what is clear is that galactic winds play an indispensable role in alleviating previous tension between the lcdm model and observations , especially in producing large velocity width dlas and disparate and low metallicities of dla gas .",

    "we see that at redshift @xmath237 it appears that the dla cross section of each galaxy is roughly proportional to the square of its virial radius , evidenced by the approximate agreement between the red and green histograms at @xmath125 .",
    "thus our model makes this rather simple prediction : dlas closely trace the overall population of galaxies at @xmath237 , with a slight relative bias for lower mass galaxies for dla hosts compared to the general galaxy population .",
    "the bias is more noticeable at @xmath6 .",
    "this is not to say that every galaxy has a dla in it .",

    "the vast majority of dlas arise in halos of mass @xmath1 , as these galaxies dominate the overall population of galaxies .",
    "we expect the clustering of dlas to be nearly identical to the overall population of galaxies at @xmath232 and gradually becomes relatively weaker compared to the galaxy population as a whole with time .",
    "based on clustering analyses , the mass range of the observed lbgs is inferred to be @xmath238 at z=@xmath239 , @xmath240 at @xmath241 , and @xmath242 at z=1.7 @xcite . comparing these",
    "observationally inferred ranges to the histograms in figure  [ fig : mhalohis ] we find that @xmath14 of dlas at @xmath13 may be lbgs and the fraction drops to @xmath243 at @xmath244 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , if dlas have a radius of @xmath245  kpc , lbgs could account for all the dlas at @xmath13 .",
    "working backwards , the estimated @xmath14 of dlas at @xmath13 being lbgs would imply a dla disk radius of @xmath246kpc for lbgs , which is significantly larger than the size of lbg stellar disks , suggesting that the distribution of neutral dla gas is in a much more extended region than stellar disk , likely a combination of some extended gaseous disk and galactic filaments .",
    "while a significant overlap between dlas and lbgs is expected , the overall clustering of dlas is expected to be comparable but slightly weaker than lbgs , since the median halo mass for dla incidence distribution is slightly smaller than the typical lbg halo mass ( more quantitative comparison will be performed in future work ) .",
    "@xcite conclude that the properties of dla hosts , including half - light radius , radial profile , optical to near - infrared color , morphology , @xmath9 emission equivalent width , and @xmath9 emission velocity structure , lie within the measured range for the general population of lbgs .",
    "since those dla hosts that are sufficiently luminous to be detected are large galaxies in the mass range of lbgs and because dlas tend to arise in gaseous galactic filaments of galaxies that experience starbursts ( via galaxy interactions ; see  3.1 ) , like lbgs , it is naturally expected in our model that they find similarity between their dla hosts and lbgs . of the remaining 70 - 80% that are not covered by lbgs at @xmath0 ,",
    "roughly 10 - 20% are due to more massive galaxies and 50 - 70% are from smaller galaxies .",
    "when systems become more dynamically advanced with time and large galaxies are no longer abundant with cold gas , a slightly more significant shift occurs between dla hosts and the overall population of galaxies at @xmath6 . at @xmath6",

    "it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate the cause for the preferred sfr range by dlas at different redshifts .",

    "these same interactions also cause the concerned galaxies to experience significant star formation , plausibly falling into the found range above .",
    "the trend of moving to lower sfr galaxies at lower redshift is perhaps due to the transition from major mergers at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) to minor mergers or smooth accretion and lack of cold gas in very large galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "all evidence - size ( figure  [ fig : sizehis ] ) , distance ( figure  [ fig : dishis ] ) , metallicity ( figure  [ fig : mtlhis ] ) and now sfr ( figure  [ fig : sfrhis ] ) - seems to point to the picture that by @xmath6 most of dls arise in disks of large galaxies of mass @xmath252 that are relatively quiet .",
