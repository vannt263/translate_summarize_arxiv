    "bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) is a very robust phenomenon . because of bose statistics , non - interacting bosons seek out the lowest single particle energy state and ( below a critical temperature @xmath0 ) condense into it , even though many almost degenerate states may be nearby . at temperature @xmath1",
    ", the condensate contains all the particles in the system @xcite .",
    "although this remarkable phenomenon was originally predicted by einstein for non - interacting systems @xcite , it became understood , starting with the work of f. london @xcite , that it occurs in strongly interacting systems such as @xmath2he . while interactions remove particles from the condensate into other states , the energy gain by macroscopically occupying the lowest energy state ( or another state , such as a vortex ) is sufficiently great that the interactions in a bose condensed system manage only to deplete a fraction of the condensate , but not destroy it @xcite .",
    "this is the case for liquid @xmath2he @xcite as well as dilute gases of bosonic alkali atoms @xcite .    in certain situations ,",
    "however , a system does not condense into a _",
    "condensate @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the physics of condensation when the ground state can contain several condensates",
    " situations of _ fragmented _ condensation .",
    "this possibility arises naturally from the very concept of bec ",
    "i.e. , that the _ non - degenerate _ ground state of a single particle hamiltonian @xmath3 is macroscopically occupied .",
    "how , instead , does condensation take place when the ground state of @xmath3 is degenerate , with two or more states competing simultaneously for condensation ?",
    "what happens if the ground state degeneracy @xmath4 is not just of order unity , but of order @xmath5 , the number of particles ? and what happens if @xmath4 becomes much greater than @xmath5 , or even approaches infinity ?",
    "how do the bosons distribute themselves in these competing levels ?",
    "in all these cases , interaction effects play an important role in determining the structure of the many - body ground state . different types of interactions produce different fluctuations ( such as those of phase , number , or spin ) and lead to different classes of ground states .",
    "exact degeneracy is difficult to achieve , since small external fields or weak tunneling effects are generically present .",
    "such energy - splitting effects lead to a non - degenerate ground state and therefore favor the formation of a single condensate . only when interaction effects dominate over energy splittings can a single condensate break up",
    ".    considerations of the effect of ground state degeneracies are not merely theoretical exercises .",
    "rather , such degenracies occur in a wide range of current experiments in cold atoms .",
    "the cases where the degeneracy @xmath4 is of order unity are related to bosons with internal degrees of freedom .",
    "examples include a pseudospin-1/2 bose gas made up , e.g. , of two spin states @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) of @xmath8rb @xcite , and a spin-1 or spin-2 bose gas such as @xmath9na or @xmath8rb in an optical trap @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "even though the two spin states of @xmath8rb are separated by a hyperfine splitting of order ghz , they can be brought to near degeneracy , with @xmath10 , by applying an external rf field . in the spin-1 bose gas ,",
    "the three spin states are degenerate at zero external magnetic field , and @xmath11 .",
    "the case of @xmath12 is encountered in one dimensional geometries @xcite , where the density of states has a power law singularity at low energies .",
    "the case of @xmath13 is realized for bosons in optical lattices @xcite with @xmath4 sites each having a few bosons ; in the limit of zero tunneling , @xmath4 equivalent sites compete for bosons .",
    "the case @xmath14 is realized in rotating bose gases with very large angular momentum , @xmath15 , in a transverse harmonic trap @xcite . as @xmath15 increases , the rotation frequency @xmath16 of the atom cloud approaches the frequency of the transverse harmonic trap , @xmath17 , causing the single particle states to organize into landau orbitals , which become infinitely degenerate as @xmath18 .",
    "the great diversity of phenomena in these experiments is a manifestation of the physics of bose condensation for varying degrees of degeneracy .",
    "as we shall see , when the degeneracy is low ( @xmath19 ) , a single condensate can break up into @xmath4 condensates . following nozires @xcite",
    ", we refer to such a state as a _ fragmented condensate _",
    "( define more precisely below ) .",
    "we caution , however , that there are many sorts of fragmented states .",
    "even degeneracy as small as @xmath10 can give rise to fragmented condensates with distinct properties which depend on whether interaction effects favor phase or number fluctuations .",
    "system with larger degeneracies usually have a larger number of relevant interaction parameters and are more easily influenced by external fields . as a result , they have a greater variety of fragmented states . for degeneracies",
    "@xmath4 comparable to or much greater than the particle number , the system does not have enough particles to establish separate condensates .",
    "instead , interactions effects tend to distribute bosons among different degenerate single particle states in a coherent way , establishing correlations between them . in such _ strongly correlated _",
    "systems , interaction effects obliterate all traces of a conventional singly condensed state .",
    "we stress at the outset that while interaction effects can cause fragmentation in the presence of degenerate single particle states , the presence of near degeneracies does not force the condensate to fragment . in many cases the ground state for a _ macroscopic _",
    "bose system is a conventional single condensate .",
    "creating a fragmented state typically requires carefully tuning the parameters of the system , and whether such a state can occur in practice is very much dependent on the system . in optical lattices and double well systems , where the tunneling between wells can be tuned arbitrarily finely , a fragmented state can easily be achieved .",
    "yet in other systems such as a spin-1 bose gas in a single trap , or a rotating bose gas , the parameter range allowing the existence of fragmented states scales like @xmath20 , making it difficult to realize these ground states unless the number of particles is reduced to @xmath21 or fewer .    in this paper , we focus on fragmentation in the ground state of bose systems .",
    "we consider a number of canonical examples ( double - well systems , spin-1 bose gases , and rotating bose gases ) , which have increasing degeneracy in the single particle hamiltonian .",
    "these examples illustrate the origin of fragmentation , the variety of fragmented states , and their key properties .",
    "we will not discuss here fragmentation in optical lattices or in dynamical processes , for they are a sufficiently large subject to require separate discussions .",
    "to begin , we first define condensate fragmentation more precisely , and the discuss general properties of certain classes of fragmented states .",
    "the concept of bose - einstein condensation was generalized to interacting systems by penrose and onsager@xcite in the 1950s , by defining condensation in terms of the single particle density matrix , @xmath22 where @xmath23 creates a scalar boson at position @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the thermal average at temperature @xmath26 . since @xmath27 is a hermitian matrix with indices @xmath28 and",

    "equation ( [ rho1 ] ) implies that if one measures the number of bosons in the single particle state @xmath37 , one finds @xmath38 .",
    "this does not mean that the wavefunction of the many particle interacting system is a product of such single particle eigenstates . unless there are special reasons ( such as strict symmetry constraints , e.g. , translational invariance ) , the eigenfunctions @xmath39 need not be the same as the single particle eigenstates @xmath40 of the single particle hamiltonian of the non - interacting system .",
    "two relevant examples are a homogeneous system of particles in free space , and a system in a harmonic trap . in the former case , where the momentum @xmath41 is a good quantum number , we have @xmath42 , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the same plane - wave momentum eigenstates . in an inhomogeneous trapped system",

    "[ bec ] ) , is that it applies to both interacting and non - interacting systems , since it makes no reference to dynamics .",

    "( [ bec ] ) as a general property of interacting bose systems .    the penrose - onsager characterization can be easily generalized to bosons with internal degrees of freedom , labeled by an index @xmath54 . with field operator @xmath55 ,",

    "( [ evolution ] ) will evolve from the coherent state @xmath416 to a fragmented state .",
    "such changes in the distribution function reflect a growing fluctuation about the initial coherent state @xmath416 singled out by a tiny symmetry - breaking field in the coherent regime .",
    "for example , in the case of repulsive bose gas in a double well , @xmath412 is the relative phase between the condensates in the two wells and @xmath417 . in the spin-1 bose gas , @xmath412 is the vector @xmath275 and @xmath416 is a direction normal to an infinitesimal external magnetic field . in the rotating attractive bose gas , @xmath412 is the location in space of the coherent state , and @xmath416 is the equilibrium location determined by , e.g. , a weak potential that breaks rotational symmetry .",
    "exactly how the fluctuations about @xmath416 grow depends on the specific dynamics of the system .",
    "large fluctuations about @xmath416 directly reflect the competition different degenerate states for bose condensation , the ultimate cause of fragmented structure , as discussed in the introduction .",

    "iii.a.2 , the transition from a fragmented to a coherent takes place around @xmath418 @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the spin-1 bose gas , where the singlet ( fragmented ) state gives way to a coherent state for field gradient @xmath419 @xcite . since the window for fragmentation vanishes as @xmath5 increases , fragmented condensates will not be realized in condensed matter systems , with @xmath420 particles . on the other hand , in mesocopic systems like quantum gases with typically @xmath421 particles",

    "the phenomena of fragmentation becomes even richer if it takes place in both real and spin space , such as with high spin bosons in an optical lattices close to the mott limit .",

    "although vortex lattices in current experiments are not thermally fragmented , there does not appear to be any fundamental impediment to making @xmath428 larger .      not surprisingly , given the fascinating nature of fragmented states ,",
    "several recent papers ( all cited in the relevant sections of this paper ) have been investigating models similar to those discussed here . as a guide to the reader",
    ", we briefly summarize these works , presenting them in roughly the same order as they appear in the main text .",
    "the two - state system was explored by nozires @xcite , who pointed out the existence of fragmentation in that system .",
    "the generic stability of a two - state fragmented condensate was considered by rokhsar @xcite .",
    "one realization of this model would be to place atoms in bonafide double - well potentials .",
    "due to mode mixing such a system is not identical to a simple two - mode model , and several authors have explored more realistic models . spekkens and",
    "sipe @xcite used a variational approach to compare fragmented and singly condensed states in such potentials .",
    "more recently , streltsov and cederbaum @xcite , along with moiseyev @xcite produced similar results through a multi - mode mean - field theory .",
    "the evolution of the ground state from a fock state to a coherent state and from a coherent state to a schrdinger - cat state was studied by ho and ciobanu @xcite .",
    "experiments have recently produced a condensate confined in a double - well trap @xcite .",
    "the fragmented nature of the ground state of the spin-1 bose gas was first noted by nozires and saint james @xcite .",
    "later studies by law , pu , and bigelow @xcite investigated the ground state properties and the spin dynamics in terms of the basis used in eq .",
    "( [ sum ] ) . ho and",
    "yip @xcite showed that the fragmented singlet state has huge fluctuations ; they also showed the relation between this fragmentation and spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "they explicitly showed how magnetic fields and field gradients drive the system into a singly condensed state .",
    "similar considerations were addressed by koashi and ueda  @xcite .",
    "javanainen discussed issues involving the measurement of the fragmented spin-1 ground state @xcite .",
    "the rotating attractive gas was first studied by wilkin et al .",
    "@xcite , who noted that the ground state was fragmented .",
    "the connection between this fragmentation and symmetry breaking was first discussed by pethick and pitaevskii @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive studies of the properties of the rotating repulsive gas in the lowest landau level  many of which have focussed on the structure of the order in the single particle density matrix .",
    "these works have mainly used a combination of exact diagonalization and variational techniques .",
    "a particularly relevant paper is the exact diagonalization study of liu et al .",
    "@xcite , which focusses on the symmetry - breaking nature of the vortex states . a related paper by jackson et al .",
    "@xcite compares mean - field and exact wavefunctions at various values of the angular momentum .",
    "the goldstone mode associated with vortex nucleation was discussed by ueda and nakajima  @xcite .",
    "fragmentation occurs in  clumped \" bosonic systems with attractive interactions .",
    "ueda and leggett used a two - mode approximation @xcite to study fragmentation and soliton formation in a one dimensional attractive bose gas .",
    "a quite thorough comparison of mean - field theory and exact diagonalzation is found in the articles by kanamoto et al .",
    "@xcite , as well as the closely related work of kavoulakis @xcite .",
    "montina and arecchi @xcite use a monte - carlo scheme to investigate the degree of fragmentation of this system . in three dimensions , elgaroy and pethick",
    "@xcite showed that a harmonically trapped gas of atoms with attractive interactions does not form a stable fragmented state .",
    "other systems with symmetry breaking and fragmentation include phase separated two - component gases @xcite , and rotating gases during a phase - slip event @xcite .",
    "boson ground states where the condensate is broken into a macroscopic number of pieces include the mott insulator @xcite , fractional quantum hall states @xcite , and the low dimensional bose gas @xcite .",
    "aspects of the dynamics of regaining phase coherence among condensates are discussed by yi and duan @xcite , a paper closely related to discussion of how the measurement process is influenced by fragmentation @xcite .",
    "finally we mention the lecture notes produced by castin and herzog for the 2000 cargse summer school @xcite , which lucidly introduces fragmentation and analyzes the case of spin-1 bosons and of the one - dimensional attractive gas .",
    "they included an extended discussion of the role of symmetry breaking .",
    "bose condensation is remarkably robust . it is therefore exciting to search for zero - temperature bosonic states which are not condensed and to understand the process that breaks up the condensate .",
    "fragmentation , where the condensate breaks up into a few pieces , is the first step in this journey , which eventually ends at strongly - correlated states possessing no trace of condensation .",
    "we have described some of the canonical models which have fragmented ground states , and extracted their properties .",
    "we see that there is a rich variety of fragmented ground states .",
    "often fragmentation is associated with restoring a broken symmetry .",
    "sometimes it is accompanied by order in higher - order correlation functions .",
    "the one unifying feature appears to be a combination of near - degeneracies and interactions .",
    "the higher the degree of degeneracy , the more fragmented the condensate may become .",
    "parts of this research were performed at the aspen center for physics and the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa - barbara .",
