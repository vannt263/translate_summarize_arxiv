    "<S> the weak value still remains obscure , not just because it is complex - valued and defies our direct perception as physical reality , but also because it lacks a solid basis for the uniqueness of the form , that is , why it takes the form as it is . </S>",

    "<S> more recently , the weak value has also been realized as a conditional average over the outcomes of povm measurements in the weak coupling limit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is more direct than these , in that the conditions are encoded in the complex probability measure as an intrinsic element to the process of the system itself , where neither the introduction of conditional probability nor the consideration of weak coupling limit is necessary . in spirit , </S>",

    "<S> note that @xmath16 implies @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> in quantum mechanics , the probability measure is indeed realized by such a measure @xmath2 , where the operator @xmath13 corresponds to the density operator @xmath20 that characterizes the state of the system , and this includes the case of a hibert space of dimension @xmath21 as well . for instance , if the system is described by a pure state @xmath22 for some normalized @xmath23 , our probability measure is required to yield @xmath24 here , the first condition states that the probability of being in the state @xmath25 is unity , whereas the second states that there is no probability assigned for an arbitrary state @xmath26 orthogonal to @xmath27 for which the projection is given by @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> it follows that @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 as well . </S>",
    "<S> this observation motivates us to rewrite ( [ compoprt ] ) in favor of @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 to find @xmath89 where @xmath90    on the other hand , an analogous argument for the state @xmath86 demanded by ( [ pure_process_con ] ) shows that @xmath62 must also be of the form , @xmath91 with some ( unnormalized ) states @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath81 and @xmath79 are not identical , we have @xmath93 . comparing ( [ wcone ] ) and ( [ wctwo ] ) , we obtain @xmath94 which implies @xmath95 since @xmath96 , @xmath97 are free parameters but subject to @xmath98 , we arrive at ( [ wcresult ] ) after putting @xmath99 .    </S>",
    "<S> having found the complex measure @xmath58 for double states specified by ( [ pure_process_con ] ) , we may consider the expectation value of an observable @xmath36 . putting aside the question of the meaning of complex probability for the moment , and assuming if necessary that ( [ pure_process_con ] ) is valid also for the case of dimension @xmath21 , we just follow the standard construction of the expectation value as we did in ( [ expreal ] ) to find @xmath100 we then notice that aharonov s weak value @xmath101 arises at the choice @xmath102 of the expectation value @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath103 is complex in general , it becomes real at @xmath104 where @xmath62 becomes self - adjoint . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that one can find the measure @xmath2 which meets the condition ( [ pure_process_con ] ) by extending the range of the map only to the entire @xmath50 , but we shall soon realize that the particular measure obtained by @xmath104 does not account for all possible cases when applied to quantum processes . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that , as for @xmath105 the sum rule holds , @xmath106 , for any @xmath107 .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in the single state limit , that is , in the limit @xmath108 the ambiguity of @xmath107 disappears and our complex measure @xmath58 reduces to the real measure @xmath2 in ( [ gleason ] ) with the condition ( [ pure_state ] ) enforced . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the expectation value @xmath103 also reduces to the conventional one @xmath105 in ( [ expreal ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another observation worth mentioning is that , since under the single state @xmath27 the probability @xmath109 represents the compatibility of the double states @xmath86 and @xmath27 , one obtains the overall expectation value of @xmath36 by the weighted product , @xmath110 . the average value obtained after allowing the state @xmath86 to vary freely </S>",
    "<S> may then be evaluated by @xmath111 where the summation is over the states of a complete basis @xmath112 of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this outcome ( [ aaverage ] ) implies that the average is actually independent of the choice of the basis set @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> this contextual independence has been mentioned earlier @xcite , but here we notice that it is also the case even with the parameter @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if one averages over @xmath27 instead , one obtains @xmath113 . in other words , the information of one of the double states will disappear once the average of the state is taken , and the outcome becomes the standard expectation value with respect to the other state left over .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have considered complex measures with @xmath62 of the type ( [ wcresult ] ) which fulfils ( [ pure_process_con ] ) . as one can extend the scope of single states from pure states to mixed states by allowing @xmath13 to be any positive self - adjoint operators with unit trace </S>",
    "<S> , one may similarly extend the scope of double states by allowing @xmath62 to be any operators with unit trace . </S>",
    "<S> if we let @xmath114 be the space of operators with unit trace , we have @xmath115 for @xmath116 and @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that , if we regard @xmath114 as the space of such generalized double states , the space is convex  in the complex sense . </S>",
    "<S> the measure @xmath118 also provides the map @xmath119 , which enjoys the affine property , @xmath120 analogous to the conventional probability map . along with the property @xmath121 and @xmath122 , this may be considered as a formal support for @xmath118 qualifying as a probability measure , albeit it is complex . to explore the possible use of the complex measure , and </S>",
    "<S> thereby examine the physical significance of the complex parameter @xmath107 in ( [ wcresult ] ) or ( [ complex_prob ] ) , we now turn to the probability measure for a quantum process .    </S>",

    "<S> let @xmath124 and @xmath125 be the initial time and the final time at which the states @xmath81 and @xmath79 are realized , respectively , and let @xmath126 be the time of measuring  the obserbable @xmath36 in the period , @xmath127 . to evaluate the outcome of the measurement results , we would like to have the complex measure relevant at time @xmath126 . assuming that our system is closed during the process </S>",
    "<S> , we have a unitary operator @xmath128 to describe the time development in the period . the forward time - developed state at @xmath126 from the initial state is then given by @xmath129 , and the backward time - developed state at @xmath126 from the final state is given by @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that , instead of the two states @xmath81 , @xmath79 , we should use these forward and backward time - developed states to characterize the measure ( [ wcresult ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus led to @xmath131 from which we can obtain the time - dependent measure , @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> the expectation value ( [ complex_prob ] ) then acquires the corresponding time - dependence by the use of @xmath133 , which is characterized by the consistency condition at the initial and final times , @xmath134    however , the identification of the operator @xmath62 by ( [ timeexpw ] ) with the process @xmath123 in the period @xmath135 $ ] is not quite correct , because our measure for double states is originally given at a single time @xmath126 and does not involve the time direction in any intrinsic manner . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one can also associate the same @xmath62 in ( [ timeexpw ] ) with the dual  process @xmath136 in the same period , since the two states that determine the double states at time @xmath126 are equivalent in both cases ( see fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> in fact , with @xmath137 , @xmath138 , one can equally characterize our measure by @xmath139 instead of ( [ pure_process_contwo ] ) . </S>",
