    "we consider situations where the interface with the substrate is disordered , such that the interfacial shear strength and fracture energy are random functions of position .",
    "while most of the mechanics literature has focused on the properties of interface cracks in systems where the properties of the interface are spatially homogeneous , failure of disordered interfaces with randomly fluctuating strength has been investigated extensively in the statistical physics community ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "besides obvious applications to materials problems such as shear failure of coatings and shear - induced delamination of thin films , the problem at hand has some interesting applications in geosciences @xcite , where models similar to the one studied in this paper have been applied to the initiation of snow avalanches and landslides .    in the present study",
    "we investigate theoretically how random variations of interface toughness affect the nucleation of interface cracks . we assume a one - dimensional geometry and evaluate the crack nucleation probability as a function of stress , geometry , and the statistical parameters characterizing the interfacial strength distribution .",
    "the theoretical arguments are validated by comparison with numerical simulations .",
    "we consider a thin elastic film tethered to a rigid substrate .",
    "the interface with the substrate is modeled as a cohesive layer in the plane @xmath0 .",
    "the response of the interface to shear loads is characterized by a scalar stress - displacement relationship @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the shear stress at the interface , @xmath3 is the interfacial shear strength , and @xmath4 is the shear displacement across the interface .",
    "the film is loaded in plane shear by spatially homogeneous tractions applied to its free surface , giving rise to a space - independent external shear stresss @xmath5 . the maximum stress that can be supported by the interface",
    "is denoted as @xmath6 , and the failure energy is given by the integral @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the characteristic displacement - to - failure .",
    "stress - displacement relationships are schematically shown in figure [ fig : tau ] for the semi - brittle ( full line ) and brittle cases ( dashed line ) .",
    "structural disorder is introduced into the model in terms of statistical variations of @xmath9 which is considered a stochastic process with prescribed statistical properties that will be specified below .    to analyze crack nucleation and propagation",
    ", we have to evaluate the internal stresses associated with the interfacial displacement field @xmath10 .",

    "the elastic energy can then be written as @xmath21    the total energy of the system is obtained by adding to the elastic energy _",
    "the work done by the shear stresses at the interface : @xmath22   \\label{gu}\\ ] ]    minimizing the total energy functional @xmath23 leads to the equilibrium condition @xmath24 where the gradient coefficient is given by @xmath25 .",
    "equations of this type have been studied by aifantis and co - workers in the context of shear and slip bands in metal plasticity ( see e.g. @xcite ) . it may be noted that in these cases the constitutive relation ( [ equil_u ] ) contains a strain variable ( shear strain or equivalent strain ) in place of the displacement variable @xmath26 .",
    "the mathematical structure is , however , the same as in the present problem .",
    "we first consider interfaces with space independent fracture toughness . this serves to derive some relations and introduce notations that will prove useful in our subsequent analysis of the disordered system .",
    "we assume that a mode - ii crack of finite length exists along the interface .",
    "such a crack is characterized by a displacement field which , for @xmath27 , starts from a value @xmath28 on the left stable branch of the @xmath29 curve , goes through a maximum @xmath30 which without loss of generality we assume at @xmath31 , and then reverts to @xmath28 for @xmath32 .",

    "the parabolic profile is complemented by two boundary layers where the shear strength @xmath29 goes through the curve depicted in figure [ fig : tau ] . for a long crack the contribution of these boundary layers",
    "can be neglected , and the energy is approximately given by @xmath37    this energy has a saddle point at the critical crack length @xmath38 .",
    "cracks above this length are unstable under the load @xmath39 and lead to interface failure .",
    "the energy required to create a critical crack is @xmath40 , i.e. , it decreases in inverse proportion with the applied stress .",
    "however , the barrier is always finite and , as emphasized by arndt and nattermann @xcite for the case of bulk cracks , at physically meaningful stress levels the typical crack nucleation energies are many orders of magnitude above typical thermal energies .",
    "hence , crack nucleation can not occur as a result of thermally activated processes .",
    "however , energy barriers may be substantially reduced or even eliminated at certain locations due to the influence of structural disorder . in the following",
    "we analyse the conditions under which crack nucleation may occur spontaneously in a disordered medium .",

    "( [ wn2 ] ) by @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and 0 for @xmath66 . in physical terms , this means that only crack sizes up to the critical one significantly affect the nucleation probability , which is thus tantamount to the probability of forming a critical ` deterministic ' crack . in this limit",

    "( [ wn3 ] ) can not be directly interpreted as a system failure probability : while eqn .",
    "( [ wn3 ] ) is evaluated under the assumption that the crack starts from the origin , nucleation from any other position would produce a similar result .",

    "reciprocal failure stresses are gumbel distributed , and the characteristic failure stress ( e.g. the median of the failure stress distribution ) scales like @xmath77 this stress decreases logarithmically with system size . it is interesting to compare this relationship with the deterministic failure stress of a system containing a crack of length @xmath34 : @xmath78 .",
    "it is evident that , in eqn .",
    "( [ sigfail ] ) , the correlation length of the disorder plays a very similar role to the crack size in case of a interface without disorder .",
    "to test the above theoretical calculations , we use a lattice automaton technique where we evaluate the displacements at discrete sites @xmath79 on a one - dimensional lattice with lattice constant @xmath47 .",
    "accordingly , we replace @xmath80 in eqn .",
    "( [ equil_u ] ) by the corresponding discrete second - order gradient .",
    "furthermore we approximate the strength - displacement characteristics by a piecewise linear curve as shown by the dotted line in figure [ fig : tau ] .",

    "note that the nondimensional value of the parameter @xmath55 , together with the interaction constant @xmath83 and the system size @xmath87 , are the only independent parameters of the problem .",
    "the system is slowly loaded by increasing the external stress @xmath88 from zero in small steps until sites become unstable as the local ( external plus internal ) stress exceeds the local shear strength .",
    "the displacement at all unstable sites is then increased by a small amount @xmath89 .",
    "new internal stresses are computed for all sites and it is checked again where the sum of external and internal stresses exceeds the local strength . the displacement at the now unstable sites is further increased , and the process is repeated until the system has reached a new stable configuration . then the external stress is increased again and so on until the system has failed completely ( @xmath90 for all sites ) .",

    "figure [ fig : strength ] shows the dependence of the mean failure strength on the value of the interaction coefficient and on the degree of disorder . as seen in the main graph ,",
    "the decrease of strength with increasing disorder ( increasing cov / decreasing @xmath55 ) is in the large - disorder regime well described by the theory in the regime of small disorder , the theory predicts a diverging strength whereas the simulation for zero disorder yields a finite strength of 1 .",
    "this is due to the finite value of the maximum stress that can be sustained by the interface ; at this point the system fails by homogeneous yielding rather than by crack nucleation [ for ideally brittle behavior the maximum stress would be infinite ] .",
    "the effect can possibly be taken into account by accounting , in the derivation of the crack properties , for a finite process zone size as discussed by bazant @xcite .    according to the theory ,",
    "the characteristic failure stress is expected to scale as @xmath101 .",
    "the inset shows that failure stresses determined for different system sizes and weibull exponents indeed collapse when scaled by @xmath102 and plotted vs. @xmath83 , even though the fit function yields an exponent of @xmath103 rather than @xmath104 .",
    "this discrepancy is attributed to logarithmic correction terms neglected in our derivation of the failure strength distribution .",
    "we have derived an analytical expression for the nucleation probability of one - dimensional cracks in a disordered interface between a thin film and a rigid substrate .",
    "the method we used is a variation of the method used by arndt and nattermann @xcite for deriving the nucleation probability of bulk cracks . accordingly",
    "the obtained relations have strong structural similarities with those found in @xcite . a main difference between the present problem and the one treated by arndt and nattermann resides , however , in the nature of the elastic interactions .",
    "elasticity is essentially non - local for a bulk crack whereas , in the present case , the small thickness of the film leads to an effectively local stress re - distribution . from this point of view",
    ", our model may be considered a continuum version of local - load - sharing ( lls ) fibre bundle models .",
    "failure probability distributions for such models have been derived by several authors ( see e.g @xcite and references therein ) . for certain types of disorder , such as a binary strength distribution , exact results can be obtained which confirm the existence of a logarithmic size effect . the present treatment , which uses extreme order statistics to obtain an expression for the size - dependent probability of system failure , is much more approximative . however , it has the advantage that the methods used can be applied to a broad class of local strength distributions with support in the interval @xmath105 $ ] . applying the present method to other local strength distributions ( e.g. log - normal ) leads to a similar structure of the failure probability distribution .",
    "the specific functional form of the distribution influences only the calculation of the function @xmath106 which characterizes the relation between the failure strength and the parameter governing the distribution width .",
    "the present investigation focuses on one - dimensional cracks .",
    "this is a major restriction since in one dimension the crack shape does not depend on the disorder . in two dimensions , on the other hand",
    ", the crack shape may adjust to the strength fluctuations .",
    "in this case , the configuration space for crack nucleation becomes much more complicated as the problem can no longer be treated in terms of the crack length only , which in the present work serves as a single reaction coordinate .",
    "instead , an investigation of crack nucleation and propagation in two dimensions requires consideration of the interplay between disorder and crack front elasticity , and a treatment of the ensuing crack front roughening .",
