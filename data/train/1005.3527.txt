    "the first accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ( hereafter amxp ) was discovered in 1998 ( sax  j1808.43658 , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and since then , a total of 13 amxps have been found and studied in detail @xcite .",
    "most amxps show near sinusoidal profiles during most of their outbursts .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which only one of the hotspots ( at the magnetic poles ) is visible ( see ref .",
    "below ) . deviations from a sinusoidal profile ( i.e , an increase in harmonic content )",
    "are generally interpreted as being caused by the antipodal spot becoming visible , perhaps as accretion rate falls and the disk retreats ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "although the amplitude of the 1st overtone may reach that of the fundamental late in the outburst ( see , e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no amxp so far has shown pulse profiles where the 1st overtone is generally stronger than the fundamental throughout the outburst .",
    "the stability of the pulse profiles in some of the amxps means that pulse profile modeling can be used to set bounds on the compactness of the neutron star and hence the dense matter equation of state ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is often a large degeneracy between the parameters due to the number of free parameters needed to construct the model profile .",
    "one of these parameters is the inclination of the system , which to date has not been well - constrained for any amxp .",
    "[ fig : lc ]    in this letter we report on the discovery and timing of the accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsar swift  j1749.42807 .",
    "thanks to the observed eclipses @xcite , we set the tightest constraint on system inclination for any amxp .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that the amplitude of the first overtone is higher / comparable to that of the fundamental for much of the outburst and that the amplitude of the first overtone is unusually high , allows to put tight constraints on pulse profile models . we show that swift  j1749.42807 has the potential to be one of the best sources for this approach to constraining the neutron star mass - radius relation and hence the eos of dense matter .",
    "swift  j1749.42807 was discovered in june 2 , 2006 @xcite , when a bright burst was detected by the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed analysis of the swift / bat and swift / xrt data and showed that the spectrum of the 2006 burst was consistent with that of a thermonuclear type i x - ray burst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see , also ) from a source at a distance of @xmath6  kpc .",
    "swift  j1749.42807 was detected again between april 10th and 13th , 2010 using integral and swift observations @xcite .",
    "we promptly triggered approved rxte observations on this source to study x - ray bursts and to search for millisecond pulsations ( proposal id:93085 - 09 , pi : wijnands ) .",
    "the first rxte observation was performed on april 14th and lasted for about 1.6 ksec .",
    "we found strong coherent pulsations at @xmath7  hz and at its first overtone @xmath8  hz , showing that swift  j1749.42807 is an accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar @xcite .",
    "rxte followed up the decay of the outburst on a daily basis .",
    "preliminary results on the rms amplitude of the pulsations , orbital solution , discovery of eclipses , evolution of the outburst and upper limits on the quiescent luminosity were reported in astronomer s telegrams @xcite .",
    "no optical counterpart has been identified as yet , with a 3@xmath9 lower limit in the i - band of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we used data from the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) proportional counter array ( pca , for instrument information see * ? ? ? * ) . between april 14th and april 21st",
    "there were 15 pointed observations of swift  j1749.42807 , each covering 1 or 2 consecutive 90-min satellite orbits .",
    "we also analyzed data from swift s x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there were a total of 10 observations ( target i d 31686 ) , all obtained in the photon counting ( pc ) mode .",
    "we used standard tools and procedures to extract energy spectra from pca standard 2 data .",
    "we calculated response matrices and ancillary files for each observation using the ftools routine pcarsp v10.1 .",
    "background spectra were estimated using the faint - model in pcabackest ( version 6.0 ) .",
    "for the xrt , we used standard procedures to process and analyze the pc mode data .",
    "when necessary , an annular extraction region was used to correct for pile - up effects .",
    "we generated exposure maps with the task xrtexpomap and ancillary response files were created with xrtmkarf .",
    "the latest response matrix files ( v. 11 ) were obtained from the caldb database .",
    "we used an absorbed power - law to fit all pca / xrt observations .",
    "we first fitted all xrt spectra and found an average interstellar absorption of @xmath11 @xmath12 ; @xmath13 was fixed to this value when fitting all ( standard ) background - subtracted pca spectra . when comparing the fluxes estimated by pca and xrt we found that the pca fluxes were systematically higher .",
    "only on one occasion rxte and swift observations were performed simultaneously ( mjd 55306.69 , i.e. at the end of the outburst ) and in this case the flux difference was @xmath14 erg @xmath12 s@xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with that seen a day later . since ( i ) the count rates during the last rxte observation ( when the source was below the pca detection limit but detected by swift / xrt ) are consistent with those we measure during the eclipses ( see section  [ sec : eclipses ] ) and ( ii ) these count rates are consistent with the offset we find between pca and xrt , we conclude that there is an additional source of background flux in our pca observations . to correct for this",
    ", we also use the background - corrected spectrum of the last pca observation ( obsid : 95085 - 09 - 02 - 08 , mjd 55307.5 ) as an estimate of the additional source of background flux .",
    "this approach is optimal in crowded fields near the galactic plane , where the contribution from the galactic ridge emission and other x - ray sources in the 1@xmath16 pca fov becomes important ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".      given the low flux during our observations , it is very important to accurately estimate the background emission before calculating the pulse fractional rms amplitudes .",
    "the fact that the extra source of background photons is unknown complicates the estimation of total background flux as a function of time . for example",
    ", the background flux could be intrinsically varying ; even in the case of a constant distribution of background flux in the sky , it would be possible to measure flux variations if the collimator ( i.e. pca ) orientation on the sky changes between observations . given the background uncertainties , we arbitrarily adopt as total 316 kev background per observation the modeled background plus a constant offset of @xmath17 ct / s / pcu .",
    "this takes into account the @xmath18",
    "ct / s / pcu as estimated by the eclipses , the last pca observation and the pca@xmath19xrt offset ( which is equivalent to @xmath20 ct / s / pcu in the 316 kev band as estimated with webpimms and the best fit model to the xrt data ) , and the @xmath21 offset we would obtain if the additional source of background photons could change by @xmath22% .",

    "we find that between mjd 55306.5 and 55307.5 swift  j1749.42807 underwent a sudden drop in flux of more than an order of magnitude , less abrupt than the 3 orders of magnitude drop in flux observed in the previous outburst of swift  j1749.42807 @xcite .",

    "adopting a source position @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( from xmm - newton images , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we converted the photon arrival times to the solar system barycenter ( barycentric dynamical time ) with the ftool faxbary , which uses the jpl de-405 ephemeris along with the spacecraft ephemeris and fine clock corrections to provide an absolute timing accuracy of  3.4@xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we created power spectra of segments of 512 sec of data and found strong signals at frequencies of @xmath28  hz and @xmath29  hz @xcite ; these signals were not always detected simultaneously with a significance greater than @xmath30 .    to proceed further",
    ", we used the preliminary orbital solution reported by @xcite and folded our dataset into 87 pulse profiles of @xmath31 sec each .",
    "we then fitted the profiles with a constant plus 4 sinusoids representing the pulse frequency and its overtones .",

    "the procedure is described in detail in @xcite . in table",
    "[ table : data ] we report the best fit solution and in figure  [ fig : profile ] we show one example of the pulse profile .    it is known that the timing residuals represent a significant contribution to the x - ray timing noise , which if not properly taken into account can affect the determination of the pulse frequency and the orbital solution ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is a hint of a correlation between the x - ray timing noise and the x - ray flux , especially between mjd 55302 and 55303 , where a slight increase of the x - ray flux is accompanied by a jump in the pulse phases , similarly to what was reported for 6 other amxps by @xcite .",
    "a complete discussion of timing noise in this source is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .    in the middle panels of figure  [ fig : lc ]",
    "we show the fractional rms amplitude of the fundamental , and of the first , second and third overtone when the signal was @xmath32 significant in @xmath33 sec datasets .",
    "the 95% confidence level upper limits are are estimated using @xmath34 sec datasets ( excluding detections ) and plotted separately for clarity . when detected significantly , the rms amplitudes of the fundamental and 1st overtone are in the @xmath35% and @xmath36% ranges , respectively ; the highest values are reached at the end of the outburst , where the uncertainties in our measurements also increase .",
    "amplitudes for the fundamental as high as 15 - 20% rms have been seen before for at least one source ( although for a brief interval , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , no other amxp shows a 1st overtone as strong as we detect it in swift  j1749.42807 . in order to compare the strength of both signals , in figure  [ fig : lc ] ( lower panel )",
    "we show the ratio between the fractional rms amplitude of the 1st overtone and that of the fundamental . as can be seen ,",
    "there are periods in which the ratio is approximately one , but also periods where the ratio is 2 or more .",
    "we note that these ratios are independent of the uncertainties on the background .",
    "we searched the rxte data for the occurrence of x - ray bursts and found none .",
    "following @xcite , we also searched for possible signatures of eclipses and found two clear cases in the rxte data ( obsids : 95085 - 09 - 02 - 02 and 95085 - 09 - 02 - 04 , beginning at mjd 55302.97 and 55305.87 , respectively ) .",
    "pca data on mjd 55306.97 ( obsid : 95089 - 09 - 02 - 11 ) samples an ingress , however , the count rate is too low to extract useful information ( but see * ? ? ?",

    "the average 316 kev count rate at the beginning of the observation is about @xmath37 cts / sec / pcu2 ( only the standard modeled background has been subtracted ) for the first @xmath38 sec",

    "the other dataset also shows a similar low - to - high count rate transition although at lower intensities : the observation samples less than 275 sec of the eclipse ( at a rate of @xmath20 cts / sec / pcu2 ) ; the count rate after the egress is about @xmath40 cts / sec / pcu2 , i.e. much lower than in the previous case .    within the uncertainties on the unmodeled background",
    ", both egresses occur between orbital phases of @xmath41 . during the eclipse",
    "the count rates in these two observations are consistent with the expected background of @xmath20 cts / sec / pcu2 , implying that that swift j1749.42807 most probably shows total eclipses ; however , given the uncertainties in the background ( see section  [ sec : bkg ] ) and the sensitivity of the pca , this should be tested and better quantified with observations from instruments like xmm - newton , suzaku or chandra ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the best solution reported in table  [ table : data ] , we also searched for pulsations in the 600 second period during which the companion star is eclipsing the neutron star ( see above ) .",
    "we found none .",
    "upper limits are unconstrained .    with our improved orbital solution and the measured times of the two egresses",
    "we determine the phase of egress to be no larger than 0.2825 . assuming the eclipses are centered around neutron star superior conjunction , the eclipse half - angle is @xmath42 , corresponding to an eclipse duration of @xmath43 sec .",
    "we do not detect any evidence of absorption in the form of dips in the light curves , probably due to the fact that our dataset only samples @xmath44 orbital periods .",
    "these dips are common in other eclipsing lmxbs and thought to be due to the interaction of the photons from the central x - ray emitting region by structure on the disk rim or by what is left of the stream of incoming matter ( from the companion ) above and below the accretion disk .",
    "these dips are known to be highly energy dependent ; both eclipses and egresses in our data are energy independent .    assuming that the companion star is a sphere with a radius r equal to the mean roche lobe radius , then the radius of the companion star can be approximated as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the semi - major axis of the system and @xmath47 is the ratio between the companion and neutron star masses , respectively @xcite . from geometrical considerations in an eclipsing system ,",
    "if the size of the x - ray emitting region is negligible compared with the radius of the companion star , then @xmath48 is also related to the inclination @xmath49 and the eclipse half - angle @xmath50 :    @xmath51    when the eccentricity of the system is zero ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; also note that the half - angle of the eclipse might be smaller as the star filling its roche lobe is not spherical , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these two equations in combination with the mass function form a system of equations that allow us to find the inclination of the binary system as a function of the neutron star and companion star mass . in figure",
    "[ fig : inclination ] we show our results . for a neutron star with mass in the 0.8 - 2.2 ( 1.4 - 2.2 ) @xmath1 range",
    ", we find inclinations in the @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) range and companion mass in the 0.46 - 0.81 ( 0.67 - 0.81 ) m@xmath2 range .",
    "knowing the inclination to a high degree of precision is useful for pulse profile modeling to constrain neutron star properties including compactness and geometry . to explore what could be done , we tried fitting simple model lightcurves to the pulse amplitude observations ( along the lines explored by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the code we use has been tested against , and is in good agreement with , the results of @xcite .",
    "we assume isotropic blackbody emission from one or two antipodal circular hot spots , and no emission from the rest of the star or the disc . at this stage",
    "we ignore both comptonization ( which might be important @xcite ) and disc obscuration .",
    "we consider as free parameters stellar mass and radius , and the colatitude @xmath54 and angular half - size @xmath55 of the hotspot(s ) .",
    "using only points where both fundamental and 1st overtone are detected with at least @xmath30 significance , we search for models that fit all observations ( amplitude of fundamental and ratio of first overtone to fundamental ) and which have the same mass and radius .",
    "hotspot size and position are permitted to vary between observations since accretion flow is expected to be variable .",
    "although it is possible to obtain a high degree of harmonic content , due to gr effects , from a single visible hotspot ( see also @xcite ) , we find that the strength of the harmonic is such that two antipodal hotspots must be visible in order to fit the data .",
    "we are also able to constrain system geometry .",
    "the 1@xmath9 confidence contours restrict us to models with @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; the 2@xmath9 contours permit a wider range of parameters but still require models where @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( hotspots must be smaller if they are located closer to the pole ) .",
    "these results , within the frame of our simple model , suggest a substantial offset between rotational and magnetic pole in this source .",
    "our models also put limits on stellar compactness .",
    "the 1@xmath9 confidence contours exclude models with @xmath60 , while the @xmath61 contours exclude models with @xmath62 .",
    "although this does not rule out any common equation of state @xcite , it does exclude some viable regions of dense matter parameter space .    our simple calculations , while certainly not conclusive , illustrate the potential of this source . with better models , and phase - resolved spectroscopy using high spectral resolution observations ,",
