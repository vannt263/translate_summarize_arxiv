    "deep near - infrared ( nir ) imaging is essential for understanding galaxy evolution at high redshifts .",
    "one of its key applications is the determination of galactic mass .",
    "nir luminosity is the best tracer of galactic stellar mass because it is less affected by extinction and young stars .",
    "this role is traditionally played by deep ground - based @xmath8-band imaging ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an important reason for this is that the @xmath8-correction at @xmath8-band is small across a broad range of redshifts and is relatively invariant against galaxy types compared to the other two nir bands ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the high sensitivity of the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac , @xcite ) adds additional powerful wavebands for this purpose ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , ground - based @xmath8-band imaging remains important because of the ease of observations .    in order to study galaxy formation and evolution ,",
    "we have been carrying out deep nir imaging in the great observatories origins deep survey - north ( goods - n , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter b08 ) we presented a deep @xmath0-band catalog in the goods - n obtained with the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam ) on the 3.6  m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the wircam image was used by @xcite to study an optically faint submillimeter galaxy .",
    "the catalog was used by @xcite to construct a mass - selected sample of galaxies at @xmath11 with an ab magnitude limit of 23.4 .",
    "we have since added more data to the wircam @xmath0 imaging and slightly improved the reduction . in this paper",
    "we present the new image and a new @xmath0 catalog . in order to achieve a more complete sampling of galaxy mass at high redshifts ,",
    "we have also constructed a new 3.6 to 8.0  @xmath5 m catalog based on _ spitzer _ irac images in the goods - n ( m.  dickinson et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , which we also present here .",
    "colors in the _ spitzer _ irac bands are used to study the redshifts of galaxies , especially optically faint ones ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is largely based on the rest - frame 1.6  @xmath5 m bump in galactic spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , which is caused by the h@xmath12 opacity minimum in the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "irac colors are also used for separating active galactic nuclei ( agns ) from galaxies ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . in b08",
    "we studied the effectiveness of using irac colors to select agns and galaxies at various redshifts based on a large spectroscopic sample , and we pointed out the limitations in these selections . with our improved color measurements in the irac and @xmath0 bands ,",
    "we revisit and discuss these issues .",
    "we describe the observations in ",
    "[ sec_observation ] , the data reduction in   [ sec_reduction ] , the reduction quality in   [ sec_quality ] , and a @xmath0 selected catalog in   [ k_catalog ] .",
    "we present in   [ sec_color ] a new method of constructing irac catalogs based on the @xmath0-band image and catalog , and we evaluate the performance of our new method . in   [ sec_properties ] we describe the general properties of the @xmath0 and irac catalog , including its overlap with other multiwavelength catalogs , the @xmath0 and irac color - magnitude diagrams and color - color diagrams .",
    "we summarize our results in   [ sec_summary ] .",
    "the images and catalog data from this work will be available online .",
    "all fluxes in this paper are @xmath13 .",
    "all magnitudes are in ab system , unless otherwise stated , where an ab magnitude is defined as @xmath14 .",
    "ultradeep @xmath0-band imaging observations of the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) , including the goods - n and flanking fields , were carried out with wircam on the cfht .",
    "wircam consists of four @xmath15 hawaii2-rg detectors covering a field of view of @xmath16 with a @xmath17 pixel scale .",
    "the observations were made in semesters 2006a , 2007a , and 2008a by two groups .",
    "a canadian group led by luc simard obtained 11.5  hr of integration in 2006a .",
    "our group based in hawaii obtained 37.9  hr of integration between 2006a and 2008a , bringing the total integration to 49.4  hr . to recover the gap between the sensors and bad pixels , all exposures were dithered with various offsets ranging from @xmath18 to @xmath19 along r.a .  and",
    "the dither patterns were changed after each semester in order to minimize artifacts caused by flat fielding or by sky subtraction .",
    "after each 0.5 to 1  hr of dithered observations , the dither centers were offset by up to @xmath20 to further broaden the area coverage and smooth out the distribution of integration time .",
    "the observations were carried out by the cfht in queue mode with weather monitoring .",
    "nearly all of the data were taken under photometric conditions . a small fraction ( @xmath21 ) of the data",
    "were taken under thin cirrus , so we have down - weighted them ( see next section ) .",
    "typical seeing for the observations is between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( fwhm ) .",
    "images taken under @xmath24 seeing were not used in the reduction .",
    "in order to reduce imaging data taken with wircam and similar cameras , we have developed an interactive data language ( idl ) based reduction pipeline  simple imaging and mosaicking pipeline ( simple ) .",
    "here we describe the simple reduction of the wircam data .",
    "the wircam images were reduced chip by chip . because of the rapidly varying sky color in the nir , only dithered images taken within @xmath25  hr were grouped and reduced together .",
    "a group of raw images were first corrected for nonlinearity in the instrumental response with correction coefficients provided by the cfht ( c .- h .",
    "yan , 2008 , priv .",
    "the images were then normalized , median - combined to form a sky flat field , and flattened with that . in the flattened images , objects were detected and masked back in the raw images .",
    "the masked raw images were normalized again by taking into account the locations of the masked pixels and then median - combined to form a second sky flat .",
    "this was used as the final flat field for flattening the raw images again .",
    "because there was still some variation in sky color within the @xmath25  hr period , the sky flat did not always perfectly flatten the images . to remove the residual gradients in the flattened images ,",
    "objects were detected again and masked .",
    "a 5th - degree polynomial surface was fitted to each masked image and subtracted from the unmasked image .    on each wircam detector , there is crosstalk between each of the 32 readout channels ( @xmath26 pixels each ) , as well as within each of the four video boards ( 8 channels each ) . for every image , simple median - combined the 32 @xmath26 stripes and subtracted the combined stripe from each of the original ones to remove the 32-channel crosstalk features .",
    "the 8-channel crosstalk features are relatively weak and only appear around bright objects after combining several hours of images .",
    "simple repeated the median combination around only bright objects and only within the affected 8 channels , and then subtracted the median image to remove the 8-channel features .",
    "all the median combinations here were performed after detected objects were masked .",
    "the above procedures cleanly removed most of the 32 and 8-channel crosstalk .",
    "very low level 8-channel crosstalk features are still visible around the brightest @xmath27 stars in our field - of - view after combining the 39  hr of data taken in 2006 and 2007 .",
    "this is probably caused by the coupling between crosstalk , flat field pattern , and sky background structures in the images .",
    "there is no trivial way to solve this , and we did not attempt to further remove this very low level effect .",
    "thanks to the wircam instrument team , the crosstalk in 2008 had improved behavior and no crosstalk residual effect is observed after the above 32 and 8-channel removal procedure .",
    "the flattened , sky subtracted , and crosstalk removed images were then used for deriving the pointing offsets between the dithered images and the distortion function of the optics . in order to obtain accurate offsets , simple uses the package sextractor @xcite to detect objects and to determine their pixel coordinates",
    ". then offsets are derived by averaging the displacements of the same objects that appear in different images .",
    "because of the optical distortion , objects in different parts of the images have slightly different dither displacements .",
    "this differential displacement is used by simple to derive the distortion function , following the technique developed by @xcite .",
    "simple uses cubic polynomials to fit the distortion functions , i.e. , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the undistorted coordinates of objects , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the distorted coordinates , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the distortion functions , and @xmath35 . to first order , the displacements of objects between dithered images can then be expressed as the expansions of the distortion functions : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the measured dither displacements of objects , which are functions of positions , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the pointing offsets of the dithering .    under the above approximation , the measured displacements of objects are the first order derivatives of the distortion functions . for @xmath41 objects in @xmath42 dithered images , there are approximately @xmath43 sets of linear equations for each of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the systems of linear equations were solved for the coefficients of @xmath33 and @xmath34 with a least - squares method .",
    "initially , the mean values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 were used as rough estimates of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "after @xmath33 and @xmath34 were integrated , they were used to correct for @xmath31 and @xmath32 to derive better estimates of the dither offsets @xmath39 and @xmath40 . then improved coefficients of @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "were solved with the new @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "for wircam , one such iteration seems to provide sufficiently good distortion functions .",
    "since the optical distortion was derived within a @xmath25 hr sequence of dithered images , the above approach has the advantage of accounting for the long - term time - dependent flexure of the telescope .",
    "it also does not require any external information and thus can easily be applied to any target field .",
    "to determine the absolute astrometry , we used several different catalogs in the hdf - n region .",
    "we first combined the catalogs of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss ) data release  6 around the hdf - n region and the v1.0 goods - n advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) catalog @xcite , after correcting for the well - known @xmath44 offset between the goods - n acs frame and the radio frame .",
    "the combined catalog was cross - checked with the source positions in the very large array ( vla ) 1.4  ghz catalog of @xcite to ensure consistency with the radio frame .",
    "the comparison between the acs and the vla astrometry is only good to several tens of milli - arcseconds , because of the differences in optical and radio morphologies of distant galaxies .",
    "this sets the limit for our absolute astrometry .",
    "we then reduced several hours of the best quality wircam @xmath0-band data and matched the wircam object positions to the above sdss / acs astrometric catalog .",
    "we added bright and compact wircam @xmath0 objects to the sdss / acs catalog to form a dense astrometric catalog for reducing the full set of wircam @xmath0 images .",
    "the final catalog has @xmath45 objects over a diameter of 1.3  degree , approximately 5700 of which are concentrated in the central 0.6  deg@xmath2 region .",
    "in all the reductions , when individual images were warped to correct for distortion and projected onto a common sky plane , the objects detected in the images were forced to match the positions in the astrometric catalog .",
    "the registration of the images onto the catalog was performed at the sub - pixel level with a bilinear resampling .",
    "there was only one resampling for each exposure in the entire reduction , which was a fifth degree polynomial including both the distortion correction and a tangential sky projection .",
    "this one - step resampling minimized the image smearing .",
    "before the distortion - corrected images were combined to form a deep mosaic , the images were calibrated for extinction variation , cosmic rays were removed , and the images were weighted .",
    "the relative extinction variation was corrected using fluxes measured by sextractor on high s / n objects in the images .",
    "then pixels in different images that have the same sky coordinates were compared for rejecting cosmic rays with sigma clipping .",
    "the clipping rate was kept to be approximately 1% so only an insignificant amount of useful data were discarded .",
    "the sigma clipping allows weighted mean combinations of the images , which produces 25% higher s / n compared to median combinations when all images have equal weights .",
    "the images were optimally weighted according to the atmospheric transparency ( @xmath46 , derived from the flux calibration , see below ) , integration time ( @xmath47 ) , and background brightness ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "furthermore , each pixel was weighted by its relative efficiency ( @xmath49 , proportional to flat field ) .",
    "thus the final weight applied to a pixel is : @xmath50[weight_eq ] since objects in the images have a wide range of sizes , we did not weight the images with seeing .",
    "the relative extinction corrected , cosmic ray removed , and weighted images were then mean - combined to form a deep mosaic .    on the mosaicked images ,",
    "object fluxes were measured again with sextractor using @xmath51 diameter apertures , and the results were cross - correlated with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) point - source catalog .",
    "we used 2mass point sources with @xmath5216.34 to calibrate the absolute flux of the wircam image .",
    "objects brighter than this range are affected by wircam nonlinearity ( despite the correction for linearity ) and objects fainter than this range show a significant selection effect in the 2mass fluxes .",
    "we adopted the 2mass `` default magnitudes , '' which attempt to account for the total fluxes of the point sources @xcite . because the 2mass @xmath0 and wircam @xmath0 filter transmission curves are very similar ( figure  [ fig_filter ] )",
    ", we directly adopted the 2mass @xmath0 magnitudes and did not attempt to account for the slight difference between the two systems .",
    "we adopted the 666.7  jy @xmath0 vega zero - magnitude provided by 2mass @xcite .",
    "calibrated mosaic images from all the dither sets and from the four chips were combined into a final wide - field , ultradeep image . all the weights described above were carried into the final image in the form of effective integration time .",
    "we found that despite the large variation in sky background brightness , noise in the final image scales nicely with the inverse square - root of the effective integration time in intermediate and shallow regions where confusion noise is less important .",
    "this means that our weighting scheme provides excellent s / n optimization .",
    "figure  [ fig_layout ] shows the integration time distribution and layout of our survey field .",
    "figure  [ fig_area ] shows the cumulative area in the final mosaic as a function of effective integration time .",
    "the final combined mosaic covers a square area of @xmath53 , centered at @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( j2000.0 ) .",
    "the central @xmath56 region has more than 20  hr of integration at each position and fully covers the goods - n acs area .",
    "the image has uniform image quality across the entire field , with a fwhm of @xmath57 .",
    "the simple reduction of the wircam @xmath0 image forced the positions of detected objects to match those in the astrometric catalog formed with the sdss and the goods - n acs catalogs .",
    "the resultant astrometry is excellently constrained by the acs catalog in the central region and reasonably constrained by the sdss catalog in the outer region . to quantify the ( relative ) astrometric accuracy",
    ", we selected well - detected compact sources ( s / n  @xmath58 and fwhm  @xmath59 ) from the sextractor catalog ( section  [ k_catalog ] ) .",
    "nearly 4000 such sources have counterparts in the sdss or goods - n acs catalog .",
    "figure  [ fig_astrometry_1 ] and figure  [ fig_astrometry_2 ] show the offsets between the wircam and the sdss / acs positions .",
    "there are no observable systematic offsets between the wircam positions and both the sdss and acs catalogs . however , the astrometry is clearly better in the central part of the image where acs sources were used to constrain the astrometric solution .",
    "the rms dispersions of the offsets are @xmath60 between wircam and acs along both the r.a .  and",
    "axes on nearly 4000 sources .",
    "the rms offsets between wircam and sdss are larger , @xmath61 for ra and @xmath62 for dec , on nearly 460 sources .",
    "we found that the sdss and acs catalogs have similar @xmath63 rms offsets between each other .",
    "this suggests the larger observed offsets between the wircam and sdss positions may primarily be a consequence of an uncertainty internal to the sdss catalog .",
    "the above measured rms offsets include both systematic and random errors .",
    "for example , the measured @xmath60  rms offset between wircam and acs is slightly larger than the nominal positional uncertainty for fwhm  @xmath57 and s / n  @xmath58 , which should be @xmath64 . to estimate the systematic error in astrometry",
    ", we repeated the same measurements with higher s / n cuts and lower fwhm cuts .",
    "the rms offset decreases initially but stops decreasing when it approaches @xmath65 , even when the selected sources have extremely high s / n ( e.g. , @xmath66 ) and have fwhm comparable to the seeing . we conclude that there is an @xmath67 systematic uncertainty in our wircam astrometry in the goods - n acs region .",
    "such an error includes both the internal error in the acs catalog and the error introduced by the image registration of simple . on the other hand ,",
    "the rms offset between wircam and sdss is @xmath63 . since all sdss sources are detected in the wircam image with s / n  @xmath68 ( median s / n is 2300 ) , random noise is negligible here .",
    "we conclude that the systematic error is @xmath63 in outer regions where acs positions are unavailable .",
    "the absolute flux scale of our wircam @xmath0 image was calibrated with 2mass point sources in the image .",
    "figure  [ fig_photometry_1 ] shows the comparison between the 2mass fluxes and the calibrated wircam fluxes derived with @xmath51 diameter apertures .",
    "the ratio between the two is only flat in a narrow flux range .",
    "we chose @xmath6916.34 ( the two vertical lines in figure  [ fig_photometry_1 ] ) for the calibration of the wircam image .",
    "outside this range , there are nonlinearity problems with the wircam sensors ( bright end ) and selection effects in 2mass ( faint end ) . in the chosen range for calibration ,",
    "the error - weighted mean of the flux ratios ( @xmath70 ) for 70 sources is @xmath71 , indicating that the overall absolute calibration of the wircam @xmath0 image is good to @xmath72 .",
    "we note that the error bars in figure  [ fig_photometry_1 ] are dominated by 2mass flux errors .",
    "thus , the calibration of our wircam image is limited by the photometric quality of 2mass .",
    "it is not possible to achieve better results unless we make frequent monitoring of standard stars during our observations , which is quite expensive in terms of observing time .",
    "we also investigated the photometric uniformity in our wircam @xmath0 image .",
    "the above value of 0.5% is the mean calibration error over the entire image .",
    "it is possible that the calibration of certain smaller regions is worse than this value .",
    "we subdivided the wircam image into four quadrants , roughly corresponding to data obtained from the four detector chips , and then compared the wircam fluxes with the 2mass fluxes as we did for the entire image .",
    "for quadrants 1 through 4 , the error - weighted flux ratios are @xmath73 ( 16 sources ) , @xmath74 ( 19 sources ) , @xmath75 ( 16 sources ) , and @xmath76 ( 22 sources ) , respectively . in all of these cases , based on the numbers of available 2mass sources and their 2mass flux errors , the expected calibration errors are roughly 1% .",
    "the standard deviation of the four measured offsets is 1.3% , which compares well with the expected calibration error from 2mass .",
    "this suggests that there is not an observable photometric gradient over size scales of @xmath77 .",
    "the absolute fluxes of objects are still limited by the photometric quality of 2mass at this scale .",
    "the measured 1.3% variation is indeed excellent when compared to other @xmath8-band extragalactic deep surveys over similar size scales ( e.g. , 2% in the cosmos survey , * ? ? ?",
    "we used sextractor ( v2.5.0 ) to produce a @xmath0 source catalog .",
    "the most important source extraction parameters in sextractor are summarized in table  [ tab_sex ] .",
    "we provide our raw sextractor @xmath0 catalog in this data release .",
    "we caution that the detection parameters ( the first three in the table ) that we adopted are somewhat aggressive in detecting faint sources , which may lead to more spurious sources ( see   [ sec_spurious ] ) .",
    "the users of our data product may want to regenerate catalogs with more conservative values , based on the nature of their work .    based on the raw catalog , we compiled a @xmath0 selected catalog , which is the primary product of this paper .",
    "we first estimated the true noise level in the wircam @xmath0 image .",
    "we masked the detected objects and convolved the image with circular kernels of amplitude 1.0 ( i.e. , flux apertures ) .",
    "the local ( within @xmath78 ) rms fluctuations in the convolved image were considered as errors in aperture photometry that include all possible sources of noise : photon noise , correlated noise between pixels , confusion noise from faint , undetected objects , and uncertainty in the estimate of the small - scale background .",
    "we compared the noise measured in this way with the photometric errors derived by sextractor .",
    "we found that for all aperture sizes between @xmath79 and @xmath51 in diameter , the ratio between the two errors is fairly insensitive to the aperture size and has a value of 1.28 .",
    "thus , we multiplied all of the flux errors in the sextractor catalog by this factor to approximate the total noise",
    ". this does not affect the flux measurements .",
    "lr detect_minarea & 2 + detect_thresh & 1.25 + analysis_thresh & 1.25 + filter & y + filter_name & gauss_1.5_3x3.conv + deblend_nthresh & 64 + deblend_mincont & 0.00001 + clean & y + clean_param & 0.1 + seeing_fwhm & 0.8 + back_size & 24 + back_filtersize & 6 + back_type & auto + backphoto_type & local + backphoto_thick & 24 + weight_type & map_weight + weight_thresh & 10    the next step is to estimate aperture corrections .",
    "in our data reduction we calibrated the flux on 2mass point sources using fixed @xmath51 diameter apertures .",
    "thus , sextractor fluxes measured with @xmath51 apertures do not need any aperture corrections and we consider @xmath51 aperture fluxes to be the best estimate of the total fluxes of the sources .",
    "this clearly does not apply to the several most extended objects in the image , since their aperture corrections should be much larger than that for smaller objects ( i.e. , 2mass point sources used in the calibration ) .",
    "since they are not the major targets of our work , we did not attempt to obtain highly accurate fluxes for these very few sources .    despite that @xmath51",
    "aperture fluxes are the best estimate of total fluxes , their s / n is relatively low .",
    "we thus looked for suitable fluxes measured with smaller apertures , and corrected the small aperture fluxes to @xmath51 when it is necessary .",
    "we compared all other sextractor flux options with the fixed @xmath51 diameter aperture fluxes and found that the sextractor `` auto - aperture '' fluxes agree excellently with them at all flux levels .",
    "in addition , the auto - aperture fluxes have the best optimized s / n for sources with various morphologies and fluxes .",
    "we thus decided to adopt directly the sextractor auto - aperture fluxes and errors in our final catalog .",
    "we did not apply any additional corrections except for the aforementioned factor of 1.28 to the errors .",
    "the adoption of sextractor auto - aperture fluxes works excellently for nearly all sources .",
    "however , a very small number of sources ( 0.7% of total ) are undetected in auto - apertures but detected in fixed apertures . for such sources",
    ", we adopted their @xmath80 fluxes and corrected the fluxes to @xmath51 with a median correction factor from all other detected sources .",
    "in addition , after all the above corrections to the fluxes and flux errors , some sources in the sextractor raw catalog are still undetected . given that our error estimate is realistic and the flux is well optimized , we considered sources with s / n  @xmath81 as undetected ( 1.9% of total ) and only included their flux errors in the final catalog for upper limits . to keep the source number and order in our final @xmath0 catalog identical to those in the sextractor raw catalog",
    ", we did not remove such undetected sources .",
    "this is for easy comparisons with the sextractor catalog , in case the users of our data need to carry out more consistency or quality check .",
    "we next evaluated the depth and completeness of our @xmath0 wircam catalog . in the central @xmath82 of the image where the sensitivity distribution is more uniform",
    ", the median 1@xmath3 error among 3@xmath3 sources is 0.15  @xmath5jy , corresponding to a 3@xmath3 limiting magnitude of 24.77 . in the goods - n region ,",
    "where the image is the deepest , the median 1@xmath3 error is 0.12  @xmath5jy , corresponding to a 3@xmath3 limiting magnitude of 25.10 .",
    "this is as deep as the irac 3.6  @xmath5 m image in the same region .",
    "we estimated the completeness of our @xmath0 catalog with monte carlo simulations .",
    "we note that completeness is a complex function of flux , morphology , crowdedness , and source extraction .",
    "the results here are meant only to provide a guide .",
    "exactly how one should carry out the completeness computation depends on the purpose of the study , and we shall leave this to the users of our data .    here , we first randomly selected well - detected ( s / n  @xmath58 ) sources from the sextractor catalog .",
    "the selected sources span a wide range of flux , size , and shape .",
    "we extracted these sources from the wircam image and artificially dimmed or brightened them to the flux range of interest .",
    "then we randomly placed them in the wircam image and ran sextractor to detect them .",
    "each time we only placed a small number of sources in the image so the overall source density did not change by @xmath83 .",
    "a total of @xmath84 sources were randomly placed in the image .",
    "the sextractor catalogs for simulated images were processed identically to the real catalog .",
    "we considered a source recovered if it is detected at @xmath85 .",
    "we divided sources into four groups according to their half - light radii ( @xmath86 ) and calculated the recovery rate in each 0.1 dex flux bin and @xmath86 group .",
    "the results in the central @xmath82 region are shown in figure  [ fig_completeness]a .",
    "the 90% completeness limits for the two compact groups ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 , comprising @xmath89 of the total sample ) are 1.10  @xmath5jy ( @xmath90 ) and 1.32  @xmath5jy ( @xmath91 ) , respectively , equivalent to 23.80 and 23.60 magnitude . for the entire sample",
    "the mean 90% completeness weighted by the size distribution is 1.38  @xmath5jy ( @xmath92 , which is equivalent to 23.55 magnitude .",
    "if we restrict this to the deeper 0.06  deg@xmath2 goods - n irac region ( figure  [ fig_completeness]b ) , then the mean 90% completeness limit becomes 0.94  @xmath5jy ( @xmath93 ) , or 23.96 magnitude .",
    "the above results show that the present wircam imaging is the deepest in the @xmath8-band over a substantial area .",
    "for example , the very large telescope ( vlt ) nir imaging in the goods - s is 90% complete at @xmath94 in a small area of @xmath95  arcmin@xmath2 @xcite . on the other hand , our team @xcite and japanese groups @xcite have carried out extremely deep @xmath0 band imaging in the goods - n at the 8.2  m subaru telescope with a smaller @xmath96 imager .",

    "we took two approaches to estimate the spurious fraction , one based on an inverted image and the other based on multi - wavelength counterpart identification .",
    "first , we constructed an image with inverted background , and then ran through the same source detection and catalog compilation described above .",
    "this infers a spurious fraction of @xmath98 on sources with s / n @xmath99 , which is unreasonably high . after examining the image and the `` sources , '' we believe this is because the crosstalk of wircam produces negative holes near bright objects , making the noise non - gaussian and greatly overestimating the spurious fraction .",
    "one evidence for this is that , in relatively crosstalk - free regions , the spurious fraction inferred from the inverted image dramatically decreases to @xmath100 .",
    "this value of 5% is an upper limit since there are still low - level crosstalk effects .",
    "we then looked for @xmath0 sources that are not detected in other images .",
    "in the region where the goods - n acs and irac images overlap , there are 15112 @xmath0 sources detected at @xmath101 . among them , 489 ( 3.2% ) sources do not have counterparts in the acs catalog and are not detected at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 m at @xmath101 in the irac catalog described in the next section .",
    "( see   [ sec_cat_overlap ] for a slightly different comparison . )",
    "the fraction 3.2% is also an upper limit since we can not rule out real @xmath0 sources being not detected in the acs and irac images , especially given that the irac images are not substantially deeper than the @xmath0 image .",

    "while our @xmath0 image has a lower resolution than the acs @xmath107 images , the waveband is much closer to the irac bands , making it a better choice for this type of analysis .",
    "the primary goal is to better measure the colors of objects between the irac and @xmath0 bands .",
    "the nearly @xmath108 resolution of irac is significantly worse than the typically sub - arcsecond resolution in the optical and nir , but it is not much larger than the sizes of galaxies .",
    "this makes color measurements extremely uncertain . normally one would need to sacrifice resolution in the optical and nir bands to achieve this",
    "the approach we describe below does not have this disadvantage .",
    "a secondary goal is to better separate irac fluxes of objects that are close to each other .",
    "there are nearly 20,000 @xmath0 detected source in the goods - n irac area , but sextractor can only directly detect @xmath109 sources in the 3.6  @xmath5 m irac image .",
    "one reason for the smaller number of sources in the irac image is that many objects are blended under the irac resolution .",
    "we will demonstrate that our method provides reasonable estimates of the irac fluxes of lightly blended objects .",
    "the basic idea is to convolve the @xmath0 image of each galaxy individually with a scaled convolution kernel to construct a model image for an irac image .",
    "the scaling of the kernel varies between galaxies because galaxies have different irac - to-@xmath0 flux ratios ( i.e. , colors ) .",
    "the set of scaling factors that produce the best model image are then the best estimates of the flux ratios .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the results would be sensitive to the evaluation of whether a model best approximates the irac image , as well as whether the chosen convolution kernel well represents the psf . in @xcite and @xcite , the model that produced the minimum @xmath6 was considered as the best model . in such analyses , @xmath6 is very sensitive to the mismatch of the psf , and unfortunately , there is a huge uncertainty in the psfs in the irac bands .",
    "this was pointed out by grazian et al .  and",
    "is also clearly shown in figure  [ fig_subtraction ] .",
    "it is thus unclear to us whether or not @xmath6 analyses are the best approach . here",
    "we present an alternative approach based on the widely used image deconvolution technique in radio astronomy ",
    "clean @xcite .",
    "instead of minimizing the @xmath6 of the pixels , clean determines the scaling of the kernels based on the fluxes of the image components .",
    "this is very attractive to us since our true goal is to be able to account for the fluxes detected in the irac images .",
    "as long as the fluxes in an irac image can be cleanly removed by subtracting a model , we consider the model to be the best .",
    "below we describe the basic steps in our analysis of the galaxy colors .",
    "we hereafter refer to our technique as realclean , since it is done in real space instead of fourier space .",
    "the goods - n irac images have pixel scales of @xmath110 , so we background subtracted and resampled them to the wircam @xmath17 pixel scale . during the resampling ,",
    "the irac images were also slightly warped such that the positions of objects precisely match those in the wircam image .",
    "to construct psfs for the irac and wircam images , we selected @xmath111 bright but unsaturated , point - like , and isolated objects in these images .",
    "the images of these objects were aligned , stacked , and normalized to form the psfs .",
    "the irac psfs were then deconvolved by the wircam psf with a maximum likelihood deconvolution of a few iterations .",
    "the deconvolved irac psfs were used as the convolution kernels to convolve the wircam image .",
    "one may worry about the uncertainty in the deconvolution of the psfs .",
    "we also tried an alternative approach that does not require the deconvolution of the irac psf , in which we measured colors in the irac images that are convolved with the wircam psf and in the @xmath0 image that are convolved with the irac psfs ( see   [ xconv ] ) .",
    "we did not see a systematic difference between the two approaches .",
    "we thus adopted the deconvolved irac psfs as the convolution kernels .      in the background - subtracted wircam @xmath0 image , for each detected object we identified pixels associated with that object .",
    "this was done with the `` segmentation map '' provided by sextractor .",
    "this allowed us to apply different scaling factors to the convolution kernels on different objects .",
    "a minor drawback here is that very faint pixels in the outer parts of galaxies would be missed .",
    "however , as long as these faint pixels do not have dramatically different colors from the brighter cores of the galaxies , our measured colors can still be considered as good estimates of the flux - weighted mean colors of galaxies .",
    "another minor drawback is pixels that contain emission from more than one object .",
    "this would only become problematic when objects are not well resolved in the wircam image .",
    "since this is the fundamental limit of the wircam observations , we did not attempt to resolve this issue .      to obtain model images that best approximate the observed irac images",
    ", we use our realclean method , which is especially useful when determining fluxes of blended galaxies . in a realclean cycle",
    ", we first identify the brightest galaxy in the irac image .",
    "then we remove a small fraction ( 25% at 3.6  @xmath5 m down to 10% at 8.0  @xmath5 m ; this factor is often called the `` gain '' ) of its flux from the irac image by subtracting a model image constructed by convolving the wircam image with the above mentioned kernel .",
    "the flux is determined by placing a circular aperture at the object .",
    "we used aperture diameters of @xmath112 , @xmath112 , @xmath51 , and @xmath113 for the irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath5 m bands , respectively . despite the fact that such aperture photometry is affected by nearby objects ,",
    "because we only look at the brightest object and because the gain is @xmath114 , we guarantee that we do not over - subtract the object . to speed up the realclean process",
    ", we subtract fractional fluxes from many objects in one realclean cycle .",
    "however , in each realclean cycle we only subtract objects that are sufficiently far away from each other that locally each subtracted object is the brightest . in the subsequent realclean cycle",
    "we look for the next brightest objects in the subtracted image and subtract small fractions of fluxes from them .",
    "we repeat this iterative procedure until no objects in the residual irac image have fluxes brighter than a few @xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the above procedure is similar to the clean deconvolution of radio interferometric data ( see a summary in @xcite ) in many ways . to limit the degrees of freedom , clean",
    "is often limited to clean windows or boxes within which emission is known or guessed to be present .",
    "clean also sometimes uses priors to improve the speed of convergence of the solution .",
    "these are exactly what our procedures do : we only subtract irac fluxes at the locations of @xmath0 detected galaxies , and we use the wircam @xmath0 images of the galaxies as the model .",
    "once realclean reaches a few @xmath3 , all objects have similar brightness and realclean is no longer efficient and necessary .",
    "thus , we measured the residual irac fluxes of all of the wircam objects and subtracted them from the irac image all at once .",
    "this global subtraction unavoidably over - subtracts blended objects , especially those whose separations are less than the flux aperture sizes .",
    "since the global subtraction is carried out only after the objects are realcleaned to a few @xmath3 , the amount of over - subtraction is small .",
    "nevertheless , the over - subtraction can be further minimized .",
    "we estimated the over - subtraction by measuring the fluxes again in the residual image .",
    "then we re - iterated the global subtraction by adjusting the subtracted fluxes and again measured the over - subtraction in the next residual image . in each iteration ,",
    "the adjustment of fluxes were small fractions ( equal to the realclean gains ) of the estimated over - subtraction .",
    "this slowly brought the residual fluxes of galaxies in the subtracted image from negative ( after the first global subtraction following the realclean cycles ) to nearly zero after tens of iterations . in the iterations , we closely watched the residual fluxes of galaxies to see if they converged to zero .",
    "when the residual fluxes no longer converged ( typically after 4060 iterations ) , we stopped the iterations .",
    "fluxes subtracted in the realclean stage and in this minimization stage were added to make the total irac fluxes of the wircam @xmath0 detected galaxies .",
    "for each irac band , there are two epochs of observations covering different areas in the goods - n but with some overlap .",
    "all the procedures described above , including the psf construction , were carried out independently on each single - epoch image .",
    "this is because the two epochs have different orientations of pixels and psfs . for sources in the overlap region",
    ", we adopted the error weighted fluxes from the two epochs .",
    "as mentioned , we used @xmath112@xmath113 diameter apertures to measure fluxes , or in other words , to evaluate whether the model best removes fluxes of galaxies .",
    "such small aperture sizes nicely cover the cores of the irac psfs and minimize influences from nearby sources .",
    "we also derived aperture corrections from the convolution kernels .",
    "however , the proper correction is a function of the sizes of the galaxies , which are not exactly point sources under the irac resolution .",
    "this biases the measured fluxes , especially when the apertures are small .",
    "our small apertures also miss the information in the outer wings of the psfs .",
    "to account for these , we repeated the realclean procedures with 50% larger apertures and compared the results with those from small - aperture realcleans .",
    "such aperture sizes are comparable to the sizes of the first diffraction rings in the irac psf and are sufficiently large for the majority of galaxies in the goods - n .",
    "we applied a constant correction factor ( 2%6% ) to all the small - aperture fluxes , derived from the large - aperture realclean on high s / n and isolated sources .",
    "we estimated flux errors in a similar way to those for the wircam fluxes described in   [ k_catalog ] .",
    "we convolved the residual irac images with circular uniform kernels of amplitude 1.0 and measured the rms fluctuation locally .",
    "this way , the measured noise included not only photon noise , confusion noise , and correlated noise , but also rough estimates of the uncertainties caused by imperfect object removal in the entire realclean and flux minimization processes .",
    "irac fluxes and errors measured in this way are included in the @xmath0 selected source catalog in this data release ( table  [ master_cat ] ) .        to evaluate the performance of the above realclean - based procedures , we first visually inspected the residual images after subtracting the best models .",
    "figure  [ fig_subtraction ] shows the hdf - n region of the irac images before and after the subtraction .",
    "overall , the subtraction of irac objects with our realclean method appears reasonably good in all irac channels .",
    "however , minor residual effects can be seen .",
    "there are faint halos around many objects in all channels after the subtraction , likely a consequence of the fact that our small flux apertures did not fully account for fluxes from slightly extended objects .",
    "on the other hand , on compact objects there are residual patterns around the cores of the objects . in the first two irac channels , this indicates a @xmath115 uncertainty in the adopted irac psf .",
    "because this occurs across the entire field , this is unlikely to be an effect of psf variation or position - dependent mis - registration .",
    "this is the most severe in the first two irac channels , suggesting that under - sampling of the psf by the large irac pixels may have played a role .",
    "however , the exact reason remains unclear to us .",
    "the 5.8  @xmath5 m channel has the cleanest subtraction of irac objects .",
    "it gets slightly worse again in the 8.0  @xmath5 m channel , likely because the 8.0  @xmath5 m morphology becomes sufficiently different than that in the @xmath0-band .",
    "0.5 cm      the above visual inspection of the residual images qualitatively shows that _ overall _ our realclean approach can account for the irac fluxes of @xmath0-band detected objects and that there are no catastrophic failures in subtracting off the irac objects .",
    "however , this does not guarantee that fluxes are correctly assigned to objects when multiple objects are blended by the irac psf . to test this , we carried out simple monte carlo simulations .",
    "we simulated objects of high s / n ( @xmath111 ) blended by nearby objects .",
    "the flux ratios between the blending bright sources and the targets are from 1.0 to 100 .",
    "the separations between the targets and the nearby sources are from @xmath116 to @xmath112 , with various position angles .",
    "all objects are point - like and have flat spectra .",
    "psfs derived from the two epochs of the real irac images and the real wircam image were used to create the associated simulated images .",
    "all the images were processed identically to the above realclean and catalog making procedures .",
    "we shown the results of the simulations in figure  [ fig_sim_clean ] .",
    "a few trends can be observed and are indeed as expected .",
    "realclean performs the best when the fluxes ratios are @xmath95 and separations are @xmath117 . at very small separations of @xmath116 , realclean can also correctly recover the fluxes if the nearby objects are less than @xmath118 brighter then the targets . among the @xmath119 real sources detected at 3.6 @xmath5 m in our final catalog (   [ sec_combined_catalog ] ) , 90% of their brightest neighbors fall in the above ranges of flux ratio and angular separation .    there no data points in regions of large flux ratios and small separations ( including flux ratios of greater than 31.6 , which are not shown ) .",
    "these are the cases in which even sextractor can not resolve the blended sources in the wircam images .",
    "realclean can not determine the irac fluxes if the sources are not resolved by sextractor in the wircam images .",
    "at the boundary when the sextractor can barely resolve the blended pairs , realclean either over - estimates ( large separation ) or under - estimates ( small separation ) the fluxes of the targets .",
    "the amount of over and under - estimate can be up to 40% .",
    "here we are pushing the limits of both realclean and sextractor . in our catalog ,",
    "the fractions of sources with @xmath120 neighbors that are @xmath121 and @xmath122 brighter are 5.7% and 3.6% , respectively .",
    "the above results imply good realclean fluxes for the majority of sources in our catalog .",
    "a small number of sources may have irac fluxes affected by very bright neighbors .",
    "the effect is generally not @xmath123 before sextractor becomes unable to detect the faint sources .",
    "the caveat here is that the above simulations are very simple .",
    "one may conduct much larger simulations with variable object morphology , s / n level , and number of blended sources .",
    "we do not think these are particularly useful given the large uncertainty in the irac psf discussed in   [ sec_residual ] .",
    "realistic simulations should take into account such uncertainties , folding in how the psf is under - sampled by the irac pixels and how the observations were carried out and reduced to better sample the images ( e.g. , dither and drizzle ) , which is out of the scope of this paper . without good knowledge about the psf , going further beyond the above simulations does not likely help on understanding the performance of realclean . in what follows , we will rely on simple consistency checks within the available data , paying special attention to blended galaxies .",
    "the goods - n irac observations consist of data from two epochs .",
    "both the psfs and the pixels in these two epochs have different orientations .",
    "the two epochs of imaging overlap in approximately 35  arcmin@xmath2 of area at the center of the goods - n . since we ran our realclean procedures on the two epochs separately , we compared our results in the overlap region to see if they are consistent",
    ". figure  [ fig_epoch1vs2 ] shows the ratios of the fluxes derived from epochs 1 and 2 .",
    "the _ dashed _ curves in each plot show the dispersion of the flux ratios , and the _ solid _ curves show the expected dispersion based on flux errors estimated in   [ sec_irac_flux ] .",
    "the fact that the two curves are very close to each other is a strong indication that our error estimate is realistic and that the uncertainty of the fluxes derived from our realclean procedure is limited by the noise in the data .",
    "we examined the irac sources that have nearby @xmath0-band detected objects with separations of @xmath124@xmath108 ( _ diamonds _ and @xmath108@xmath80 ( _ triangles _ ) . in the @xmath124@xmath108 category ,",
    "the distributions of the flux ratios are not significantly different from the main sample , except that at 8.0  @xmath5 m . at 8.0  @xmath5",
    "m the @xmath108@xmath80 category has a distribution similar to the main sample .",
    "these results suggest that our procedures produce consistent results against slight changes in the psf for blended sources with separations greater than @xmath124 at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  @xmath5 m and @xmath108 at 8.0  @xmath5 m . in the @xmath0 catalog for sources with s / n @xmath125 ,",
    "the median separation between galaxies and their nearest neighbors is @xmath126 , and 99.5% of sources do not have a nearest neighbor within @xmath124 .",
    "this suggests that nearly all of the fluxes we derived for the first three irac channels are reliable . on the other hand , among the @xmath127 8.0  @xmath5 m detected sources , approximately 10% of the sources have nearest neighbors at @xmath128 .",
    "their fluxes are more problematic , if figure  [ fig_epoch1vs2 ] is indicative .",
    "however , the percentage would be lower if we only considered sources whose nearest neighbors were significantly brighter than themselves .",
    "one can imagine that if sources with similar fluxes are blended , realclean naturally assigns similar fluxes to both if the gain is sufficiently small ( which is the case for our 8.0  @xmath5 m realclean ) .",
    "on the other hand , if sources with different fluxes are blended , the procedure might fail , especially on the fainter member of the pair .",
    "these are also indicated in our monte carlo simulations .",
    "the key goal of our analyses is to obtain accurate colors for the wircam and irac sources .",
    "we selected sources that have redshifts in the spectroscopic survey of b08 and compared their colors with model seds .",
    "here we used two seds with dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) features from @xcite , m  82 ( a dusty starburst ) and m  100 ( a spiral ) , and a dustless starburst template from @xcite that has a blue stellar continuum and strong recombination lines .",
    "we also reddened the m  82 sed with @xmath129 using the @xcite extinction law .",
    "these four seds represent a broad range of galaxy colors .",
    "figure  [ fig_z_color1 ] shows the comparison between the data and the model seds . as in figure",

    "overall the derived irac and @xmath0 colors match the sed models excellently . at @xmath130 and 3.4 in the @xmath131 ratio and @xmath132 in the @xmath133 ratio , there are substantial numbers of observed colors significantly bluer than the starburst model .",
    "this is true for both isolated galaxies and galaxies with close neighbors .",
    "we believe these blue `` outliers '' are not artifacts of our realclean procedures but rather objects with emission lines even stronger than those in the starburst template .",
    "the lines are likely h@xmath134 and [ ] ( entering @xmath0 at @xmath130 ) , h@xmath135 and [ ] ( entering @xmath0 at @xmath136 ) , and [ ] ( entering the 3.6 @xmath5 m band at @xmath132 ) , all present in the starburst template .",
    "we attempted to verify this with our spectroscopic data .",
    "unfortunately , we only have optical spectra on three of these galaxies , as most of the redshifts are adopted from @xcite .",
    "the three sources have standard lyman break galaxy spectra with strong absorption . in one case",
    "there is also ly@xmath134 emission . in the other cases we do not cover ly@xmath134 .",
    "galaxies with strong rest - frame optical ( corresponding to @xmath0 and irac bands at these redshifts ) emission lines have absorption lines in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( corresponding to optical at these redshifts ) . given their rest - frame ultraviolet continua , these three galaxies are inevitably strong emission - line galaxies in the rest - frame optical .",
    "this is consistent with strong emission lines causing the blue observed colors at @xmath0 and irac .",
    "there are a few unexplained blue outliers at @xmath1372 in @xmath131 and at @xmath138 in @xmath133 .",
    "they might be fluxes mistakenly assigned by our realclean procedure . however , if this is the case , it would be very surprising if such outliers are not observed at all at @xmath11 , where most of the spectroscopic samples lie .",
    "an alternative explanation is that they are galaxies with misidentified redshifts .",
    "we have spectra for these galaxies , except for two whose redshifts were adopted from @xcite .",
    "we inspected the available spectra and did not see obvious signs of misidentification .",
    "thus , the nature of these blue outliers remains unclear .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the observed irac colors of the majority of the galaxies match excellently with the models at nearly all redshifts . combining this with our observations in   [ sec_overlap_region ]",
    ", we are confident that our realclean procedures correctly assigned fluxes to nearly all of the irac sources .",
    "the last performance test is a comparison with _",
    "absolute flux calibrators in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_star_color ] shows the measured colors of the spectroscopically identified stars brighter than @xmath139 and the colors of the irac primary absolute calibrators in reach et al . among the calibrators ,",
    "a dwarfs are shown with _",
    "filled squares _ and k giants are shown with _",
    "open diamonds_. reach et al .  found a displacement between the calibration derived from a and k stars , especially in the first two irac channels .",
    "the reason for this is unclear and the authors decided to adopt an absolute calibration based on only a stars . in figure  [ fig_star_color ]",
    "we see a gradual drift of the irac colors for our data with respect to the irac calibrators , from blue to red in the @xmath131 color .",
    "however , since the irac absolute calibration is based on a stars , it is more appropriate for us to compare a stars only . at the very blue end where we find three of the four a - type irac calibrators ,",
    "our observed colors for the stars agree excellently with the irac calibrators .",
    "the largest offset is observed in the @xmath133 color ( _ top _ panel ) , where the stars in the left appear to be @xmath140 magnitude bluer than the mean color of the a - type calibrators ( measured from stars with @xmath29-axis values @xmath141 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that our colors are well calibrated , with systematic errors no larger than @xmath115 .      despite all the tests above , the irac fluxes derived by our realclean procedures are not perfect . the psfs we used for realclean can only effectively remove fluxes within @xmath142 the fwhm .",
    "there are about 10 or so very bright stars with psf wings , which are much broader than this .",
    "objects close to these bright stars , especially those on the diffraction spikes and crosstalk features , have systematically higher irac fluxes .",
    "a more subtle effect is seen in a few very crowded regions where more than three objects heavily overlap . in such configurations objects that are close to the centers of the groups of objects",

    "we describe an alternative method that can better handle the former issue but is more vulnerable to the latter .",
    "we started with the background subtracted and registered images used for the realclean procedure .",
    "for each single - epoch irac image , we convolved the wircam @xmath0 image with the irac psf and the irac image with the wircam psf .",
    "we refer to this procedure as cross - convolution ( xconv ) .",
    "we then used the 2-image mode of sextractor to detect sources in the unconvolved wircam image and to measure the wircam and irac fluxes in the xconved images at the locations of the detected wircam sources .",
    "the psfs in the xconved images have fwhms of slightly larger than @xmath108 . after experimenting with various photometry apertures",
    ", we found that a @xmath80 aperture gives the best compromise for s / n , inclusion of most fluxes from a wide range of source structure , and blending of sources .",
    "here we focus on the @xmath0-to - irac colors measured this way , and we do not attempt to measure total fluxes .    the advantage of the xconv method is clear : the psfs are ideally matched and deconvolution of the irac psfs is not required ( unlike in the realclean method ) .",
    "the disadvantage is the severely degraded @xmath0 image resolution , which prevents the extraction of information on both blended sources and faint sources .",
    "because of these , we consider the xconv colors of relatively bright and isolated sources to be more robust than the realclean colors .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig_compare_colors ] , the xconv colors and the realclean colors turn out to be remarkably consistent .",
    "the systematic offsets in figure  [ fig_compare_colors ] between these two colors for @xmath143 @xmath144  @xmath5jy objects are 0.002 , -0.024 , 0.031 , and 0.030 ( from 3.6 to 8.0  @xmath5 m ) .",
    "we examined the small number of objects in the figure that have offsets of @xmath145 at @xmath144  @xmath5jy .",
    "they are either close to bright objects ( a weakness of the xconv method ) or are in regions with multiple intermediate brightness objects ( a weakness of the realclean method , as mentioned in   [ issues ] ) .",
    "the excellent consistency between the xconv colors and the realclean colors further shows that our realclean method is robust .",
    "we thus consider the realclean catalog as the primary product of this work , and we recommend it for most applications . on the other hand , since the xconv colors have unique advantages in their own right , we also provide the xconv colors in table  [ xconv_cat ] .",
    "we remind the reader that the xconv colors are less reliable on faint or blended sources .",
    "such colors should be adopted with caution .",

    "this can also be seen in figure  [ fig_z_color1 ] , which is based on our spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the division at @xmath160 in the @xmath133 color is much more apparent in figure  [ fig_color_mag-1 ] because figure  [ fig_z_color1 ] suffers a bit from the spectroscopic redshift desert at @xmath161 .",
    "the bimodality nearly disappears in the @xmath162 color and entirely disappears in the @xmath163 color .",
    "the main reason is that strong pah emission from low - redshift starbursts significantly reddens the colors .",
    "a minor reason is the relatively lower s / n at these longer irac bands .    in figure  [ fig_color_mag-2 ]",
    "we show the color - magnitude diagrams for the x - ray , 24  @xmath5 m , and 1.4  ghz selected sources discussed in the previous subsections .",
    "the @xmath131 colors of all three populations lie in a well - defined area of the color - magnitude space .",
    "the distributions are determined by the sensitivities at x - ray , 24  @xmath5 m and 1.4  ghz , plus loose correlations between luminosities at these wavebands ( tracing star formation and black hole accretion ) and the rest - frame 14  @xmath5 m luminosities ( tracing stellar mass ) . at bright magnitudes the sources are at low redshifts ( the blue branch ) , while at the fainter fluxes the sources are at @xmath164 and the sources move to the red branch .",
    "the trend is the weakest for x - ray agns ( open squares in figure  [ fig_color_mag-2]a ) , but it is still observable .",
    "the distributions in the @xmath133 and @xmath162 colors of these three populations are more or less similar , and we do not show them here .",

    "with these two irac color - color diagrams , we analyzed efficiencies and contaminations of selections of @xmath171 and @xmath172 galaxies as well as agns . since the quality of the irac photometry is improved here , it is interesting to revisit these issues .",

    "the color bimodality shown in figure  [ fig_color_mag-1]b is clearly seen here .",
    "the _ dashed lines _ are the @xmath171 selection proposed by b08 .",
    "we reported in b08 that this selection can pick up 90% of @xmath171 galaxies , but 39% of the galaxies that satisfy this criterion are @xmath173 contaminants . in the 3@xmath3 8.0  @xmath5 m sample here , there are 2096 spectroscopic redshifts , 352 of which are at @xmath171 .",
    "the above selection picks up 241 of them , corresponding to a selection completeness of 68% , much lower than that in b08 . on the other hand",
    ", the selection only picks up 54 @xmath173 galaxies , corresponding to a selection contamination of 18% , also much lower than that in b08 .",
    "the results do not change much if we limit to higher s / n 8  @xmath5 m sources where the measurements of colors are more robust .",
    "the inconsistency between the results here and our previous results is most likely a systematic difference in the calibration of the irac fluxes .",
    "for example , if we make the galaxies here @xmath174 magnitude redder in the @xmath133 color , then the completeness and contamination both become similar to those in b08 .",
    "the above comparison shows that using irac colors to select high - redshift galaxies is extremely sensitive to how galactic colors are measured .",
    "this also emphasizes that simply adopting existing irac color selection schemes may be problematic unless one is very careful about the fine details of the color measurements . bearing this in mind ,",
    "the selection completeness and contamination are then just a matter of fine tuning the selection criteria at the expense of one another .",
    "such fine tuning also requires a relatively large sample of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "in addition to the very likely difference in the colors , the basic conclusions about irac color selections on high - redshift galaxies remain unchanged here and in b08 .",
    "there are also other high - redshift galaxy selections .",
    "the _ dotted lines _ in figure  [ fig_color_color1 ] show the @xmath175 selection adopted by @xcite and @xcite for studies of submillimeter galaxies .",
    "we found that all of the above conclusions apply to this selection as well .",
    "this selection has either incompleteness at high redshift or contaminations at low redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig_color_color1]b shows x - ray sources and x - ray agns .",
    "the irac colors suggested by @xcite to select most broad - line agns are enclosed by _",
    "solid lines_. however , here we see that the stern et al .",
    "selection only picks up a fraction of the x - ray agns . by comparing both panels in figure  [ fig_color_color1 ] as well as figures  [ fig_z_color1]b and d",
    ", we see that the same region also selects a larger number of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "these galaxies do not show up in the relatively shallow data of ( * ? ? ? * their figure  1 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the finding in b08 and @xcite that high - redshift reddened objects occupy similar color spaces to agns .",
    "the selection of @xcite does not pick up the majority of agns and has substantial galaxy contamination .",
    "b08 also presented @xmath169 vs.  @xmath170 color - color diagrams and used them to analyze selections of @xmath172 galaxies and the @xcite selection of agns .",
    "as with the @xmath133 vs.  @xmath163 color - color diagram , b08 concluded that the irac selection of @xmath172 galaxies can be very complete ( @xmath176 ) , but it has a large contamination ( @xmath177 ) from low - redshift galaxies .",
    "b08 also found that the @xcite selection of agns is incomplete ( though better than the @xcite selection ) and has severe galaxy contamination .",
    "we present the updated @xmath169 vs.  @xmath170 color - color diagrams in figure  [ fig_color_color2 ] , and we confirm all the conclusions made by b08 .",
    "to sum up , using irac colors to select high - redshift galaxies can be either incomplete or suffer from contaminations from agns or low - redshift galaxies .",
    "the selection can be fine tuned to balance the completeness and contamination , but this requires a good spectroscopic sample and/or extremely well measured irac colors .",
    "we also found that galaxies and agns occupy a very similar region of color space .",
    "the irac selections of agns based on the @xcite and @xcite methods always include large numbers of galaxy contaminations and have various degrees of incompleteness .",
    "the above discussion only includes irac colors . in this work",
    ", we presented ultradeep @xmath0 photometry , which can be a powerful tool for studying galactic colors .",
    "we show the @xmath178 vs.  @xmath133 color - color diagrams for 4.5  @xmath5 m and x - ray sources in figure  [ fig_color_color3 ] . here",
    "we only adopt the two shortest irac bands for their higher s / n and for their continuous availability in the _ spitzer _ warm phase mission .",
    "again , we see that the x - ray agns occupy a color space that is nearly identical to that of galaxies .",
    "such a diagram is extremely ineffective for separating galaxies and agns . on the other hand ,",
    "this color - color diagram is much more structured than the previous irac - only diagrams , suggesting that these colors can provide an excellent redshift diagnostic .",
    "figure  [ fig_color_color3 - 2 ] shows the same diagram as figure  [ fig_color_color3 ] , but only for the spectroscopic subsample drawn from b08 .",
    "there is a very subtle difference in the distributions of galaxies in these two diagrams ( 4.5  @xmath5 m selected vs.  spectroscopically identified ) , because the spectroscopic identifications suffer from the redshift desert and are somewhat biased to galaxies with strong emission lines that can have unusual @xmath178 colors ( see   [ sec_compare_sed ] ) .",
    "however , three distinct redshift groups can be seen in both diagrams : @xmath179 , @xmath71.2 , and @xmath175 . in particular",
    ", we find that the following selection criteria are especially effective in selecting intermediate redshifts of @xmath71.2 : @xmath180 this selection is shown as the _ solid lines _ in figure  [ fig_color_color3 - 2 ] .    in figure  [ fig_color_color3 - 2 ] a total of 2834 spectroscopic identifications are included , among which 1079 are at @xmath71.2 .",
    "the above @xmath0 and irac selection picks up 870 galaxies at @xmath71.2 , corresponding to a selection completeness of 81% . on the other hand",
    ", the selection also picks up 86 galaxies at @xmath179 , 26 galaxies at @xmath175 , and 3 stars , corresponding to a contamination of 11.6% .",
    "it is possible to fine tune the selection criteria to achieve higher completeness at the expense of increasing contamination , or vice versa .",
    "for example , after we moved the selecting region in the diagram towards the lower - right by 0.1  magnitude along both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 axes , the selection completeness increased to 89% , but the contamination also increased to 17% .",
    "@xmath178 and @xmath133 colors can still be measured in the _ spitzer _ warm phase mission and can be used in different ways .",
    "the above @xmath71.2 selection picks up galaxies at redshifts just lower than that in the popular @xmath181 selection ( @xmath1372.5 , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies at @xmath175 and @xmath179 can also be selected from the same diagram .",
    "in addition , in a subsequent paper , we will use the same diagram to select @xmath182 massive and dusty galaxies ( wang et al .",
    ", in preparation )",
    ".    generally speaking , the addition of the @xmath0-band data increases the redshift resolution at @xmath183 . at higher",
    "n this will greatly help irac - based photometric redshift studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be more powerful than simple color selections . on the other hand , in all the examples discussed in this paper , irac colors become much less efficient in separating galaxies at @xmath182 , even after the inclusion of @xmath0 . for these high - redshift galaxies , optical colors or photometric redshifts that combine optical , nir , and irac bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be much better .",
    "however , on optically faint objects such as high - redshift submillimeter galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , colors from deep nir and irac imaging are valuable in studying their redshifts .",
    "we carried out ultradeep @xmath0 band imaging in the hdfn and its flanking field with wircam on the cfht .",
    "the mosaic image has a size of @xmath184 , fully covering the goods",
    "- n field . with nearly 50  hr of integration",
    ", we reached a 90% completeness limit of 1.38  @xmath5jy ( @xmath185 ) in the 0.25  deg@xmath2 region , and 0.94  @xmath5jy ( @xmath186 ) in the 0.06  deg@xmath2 goods - n irac region .",
    "the faintest detected objects have @xmath0 fluxes of @xmath187  @xmath5jy ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "the photometry is uniform across the entire field , and the variation is well within 2% . in the goods - n region",
    "the astrometry is accurate to @xmath65 for compact objects with high s / n .",
    "the @xmath0 images and the associated catalogs are available through the internet .",
    "we used the @xmath0 image and catalog as priors to measure mir magnitudes in the _ spitzer _ irac 3.6 to 8.0  @xmath5 m bands with our realclean method .",
    "we verified the realclean results using data taken in two different epochs of observations , as well as by comparing our colors with the colors of stars and with the colors derived from model seds of galaxies at various redshifts .",
    "the realclean method appears to provide reasonably good photometry even on galaxies that have close neighbors within @xmath108 .",
    "this also provides a relatively clean way to identify faint irac objects that are not detected in the @xmath0 image .",
    "we make the realclean irac catalogs for both @xmath0 detected and undetected objects available to the community .",
    "additional to the realclean method , we also measured galactic colors by convolving the @xmath0 image with the irac psfs and convolving the irac images with the @xmath0 psf .",
    "the derived colors are consistent with the realclean results .",
    "we found our @xmath0 sample to be extremely powerful in studying the multiwavelength properties of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the @xmath0 image detected most ( if not all ) of the x - ray , 24  @xmath5 m , and radio sources published in this field .",
    "on the other hand , only 40% of the _ hst _ acs sources in the goods - n are detected at @xmath0 at the current depth .",
    "we studied various @xmath0 and irac color - magnitude and color - color diagrams .",
    "because of the rest - frame 1.6  @xmath5 m bump in the seds of galaxies , galaxies show significant color evolution in the @xmath0 and irac bands from @xmath189 to @xmath183 .",
    "we found that using irac colors to select galaxies at certain redshifts is extremely sensitive to the color measurements and that balancing selection completeness and contamination will require careful tuning of the selection criteria with a good spectroscopic sample .",
    "we discussed an effective selection of @xmath71.2 galaxies using the @xmath0 band and the two shorter irac bands that will remain available in the _ spitzer _ warm phase mission .",
    "we also confirmed our previous studies ( b08 ) that the irac agn selections in @xcite and @xcite are either incomplete at the low - luminosity end or suffer severely from galaxy contamination .",
