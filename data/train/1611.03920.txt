    ", @xcite developed a model of sunspot disintegration by turbulent `` erosion '' of penumbral boundaries , which occurs when bits of magnetic field are sliced away from the edge of a sunspot and swept to the supergranular cell boundaries by supergranular flows @xcite .",
    "a key feature of the erosion model is that the turbulent diffusivity , associated with the flows , is suppressed within the spot .",
    "the assumption is justified by the theoretical prediction that the diffusivity @xmath0 should rapidly decrease if the magnetic field @xmath2 exceeds an energy equipartition value @xcite , which is why the diffusivity in the turbulent erosion model may be assumed to be a decreasing function of the magnetic field strength .",

    "following @xcite , @xcite assumed in their study that the turbulent diffusivity @xmath7 within a decaying sunspot is much less than that outside the spot .",
    "a more realistic model should incorporate a more realistic dependence of the turbulent diffusivity on the field strength within the spot .",
    "our aim in this paper is further to develop the theory of turbulent erosion by exploring the effect of a non - vanishing diffusivity within a sunspot on the rate of its disintegration .    theoretical mechanisms and observable features of the diffusive transport of the photospheric magnetic field have been a subject of intense research activity .",

    "our analysis makes it clear that a variety of scalings @xmath140 are theoretically possible , depending on initial conditions and the dependence of the turbulent diffusivity on the magnetic field strength within the spot .",
    "the results may have implications for the use of the model for estimating the magnetic diffusion timescale in starspots , which is an important parameter in stellar dynamo models .",
    "experimental studies typically attempt to infer the anomalous , turbulent - driven magnetic diffusivity by equating the lifetime of a spot to a theoretical diffusion time scale @xcite .",
    "we expect that the more detailed analytical models we have developed may help to improve the accuracy of the procedure .",
    "more generally , we expect that the new models may allow insight into differences and similarities between sunspots and starspots .",

    "the deviations from the parabolic decay are large for any one spot @xcite , motivating the use of continuous linear piecewise functions in modeling of the starspot growth and decay @xcite .",
    "such an approach is consistent with the more general decay laws predicted in our analysis , ultimately controlled by the dependence of the magnetic diffusivity on the magnetic field strength within a spot .",
    "as pointed out by the referee , however , apparent deviations from the parabolic decay law for individual spots can be caused by the difficulty of identifying the individual spots within a decaying sunspot group or by the effect of a varying external plage field outside the spots @xcite .",
    "the turbulent erosion model can be further improved .",
    "recall that the solution for @xmath79 in @xcite describes turbulent erosion of a sunspot as a moving boundary problem in which the rate of sunspot decay is controlled by the inward speed of a current sheet around the spot .",
    "in other words , the decay rate is determined by the local diffusion rate of magnetic field within the sheet , modeled as a tangential discontinuity at @xmath141 . by contrast , the new solution given by equations ( [ eq - re - approx ] ) and ( [ eq - t - approx ] ) describes the sunspot decay determined by global magnetic field diffusion , and the field discontinuity is ignored in the smooth profile of the evolving magnetic field , which should be a reasonable assumption if @xmath94 . the diffusive evolution of exact self - similar solutions is also a global process . yet",
    "physically the sunspot disintegration rate is likely to be influenced by both mechanisms , and so a more accurate solution for intermediate values of @xmath95 should incorporate both local and global diffusion processes by considering a more general initial field profile in the spot and more realistic diffusivity dependence on the magnetic field strength .",
    "more detailed models of spot decay should also quantify the effects of flux cancellation , caused by photospheric magnetic reconnection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "application of the model to the data on sunspot and starspot decay may shed light on the physics of turbulent diffusion in magnetized astrophysical plasmas .",
