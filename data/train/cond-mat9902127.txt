    "experimental and theoretical studies of weak localization have given considerable insight into the physics of small disordered conductors . a review of this research can be found in @xcite . since interference between time - reversed electron trajectories@xcite is the root cause of weak localization , its strength depends on phase coherence between such paths .",
    "dephasing can be due to extrinsic causes , such as applied magnetic fields , or to intrinsic mechanisms that remove phase information , for example scattering against localized spins , or the electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions , the last being the more important at low temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the effect of electron - electron interactions on weak localization .",
    "our aim is to understand quantum corrections to a theory @xcite in which the influence of these interactions is modeled as a fluctuating classical electromagnetic field .",
    "the subject is topical because of experimental work @xcite suggesting that the dephasing rate saturates to a finite value as the temperature approaches zero , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite predicts the rate to vanish in this limit .",
    "now , one certainly expects quantum corrections to the last mentioned theory .",
    "the relevant question , which we address here , is whether the corrections are important in the region of weak localization .",
    "our conclusion , in brief , is that they are not .",
    "it is worth comparing our approach to quantum effects with a recent preprint @xcite in which very complete calculations of the quantum mechanical correction to the drude conductivity of a weakly disordered metal are carried out to second order in the screened electron - electron interaction . in the absence of dephasing",
    ", the weak localization correction for narrow wires contains an infrared divergence .",
    "this divergence can not be cured in finite order perturbation theory .",
    "for this reason , a magnetic field is posited in ref .",
    "@xcite , providing a low frequency cut - off .",
    "the cut - off dependence of the correction to weak localization is found to be exactly as expected from @xcite .",
    "although we find this argument completely convincing , it is nonetheless true that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are , strictly speaking , only valid when the electron - electron interaction produces a small correction to the effect due to some other mechanism .",
    "[ see , however , section vi , below .",
    "] now , the calculation of @xcite has the considerable merit of treating classical fluctuations exactly , thereby being free of low frequency divergences . by building on this calculation",
    ", we are able to test its validity in the absence of extrinsic influences .    according to paper @xcite ,",
    "the first order diagrams in the interaction can be divided onto two parts : @xmath0 , @xmath1 is called the dephasing term and the other @xmath2 is the interaction correction to weak localization . although they both originate from the same type of diagrams they have different dependences on the parameters of the system .",
    "for example , it was shown in @xcite , that for one dimensional wires [ b2 ]    c _ deph = d^1/2_h^3/2 + _ cwl=-3(3/2 ) .",
    "here @xmath3 is the dephasing time due to an external magnetic field , which appears in the calculations of @xcite as a low frequency cutoff .",
    "we see that the most singular term is the dephasing correction which is proportional to @xmath4 , while @xmath5 .",
    "we consider here only the dephasing term of the weak localization correction to conductivity .",
    "the physical meaning of both of these terms was explained in @xcite .",
    "we would like to note only that the dephasing term is the result of the interference of two time reversed paths ( see below ) , while the interaction correction term is the result of interference for more complicated trajectories .",
    "it is appropriate here to mention some other recent work . in e ",
    "print @xcite by us we suggested that the saturation in dephasing rate @xcite can be explained in the framework of the caldeira ",
    "leggett model @xcite .",
    "this paper is simply wrong , because it treats the phase as a single particle and loses the physics associated with the exclusion principle .",
    "the present work is the promised revision of ref .",
    "we also remark that golubev and zaikin @xcite have a calculation which claims to treat interaction effects to all orders in perturbation theory and obtains a finite dephasing rate from the electron - electron interaction at zero temperature .",
    "we believe that this surprising result is due to uncontrolled approximations , and comment on it is in appendix c of this paper .    in outline ,",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce a model in which the dephasing environment is modeled by a set of harmonic oscillators , in the manner of feynman and vernon @xcite and leggett and caldeira @xcite , which are coupled to the charge density of an electron gas in a random potential . by a suitable choice of the spectrum of oscillators , we obtain after integrating out the oscillators the influence functional corresponding to the diffusively screened electron interaction . up to this point",
    "our calculation is identical to that in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we deviate from previous work by now separating the influence functional into a classical part and a remainder . in section 3",
    "we show that the effect of the classical fluctuations on the back scattering ( or weak localization ) correction to the drude conductivity can be written as a path integral , thereby exactly reproducing the result obtained in ref .",
    "the improvement over that work is that we have an explicit expression for the remainder . at this point",
    "it is convenient to specialize the model to the case of nyquist noise which yields an simpler path integral , and allows further calculations to be done analytically .",
    "this model is used in section 4 to explicitly calculate the quantum corrections to second order . in section 5",
    "we give semiquantitative arguments for how these calculations are modified when the more realistic spectrum corresponding to the screened electron - electron interaction is used , and infer the structure of the corresponding quantum corrections up to numerical coefficients .",
    "the final section contains a discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "as the starting point for our calculations we use a variant of the feynman - vernon @xcite , leggett - caldeira @xcite method in which a dissipative environment is described by a set of harmonic degrees of freedom . in this way",
    "we are able to construct a formalism general enough to accommodate different models for the electron - electron interaction .",
    "consider a closed system described by a hamiltonian consisting of three parts [ 1.1 ] h(t)= h_0(t ) + h_env(t ) + h_int(t ) . here",
    "the first term describes a disordered free electron subsystem , [ 1.2 ] h_0(t)= d^+(t,)(-i- -+u(r))(t , ) , where @xmath6 is chemical potential and @xmath7 is a random impurity potential .",
    "the next term is the hamiltonian for harmonic electromagnetic modes , [ 1.3 ] h_env(t)= _ _(a^+ _ a_+ ) , where @xmath8 labels different modes of the electric field , which correspond to spatial wave functions @xmath9 which can be chosen to be real .",
    "the interaction between the field and the electron system is [ 1.4 ] h_int(t)=d^+(t,)v(t,)(t,)= dv(t,)q(t , ) , where @xmath10 and [ 1.5 ] v(t,)= _ ( _ ( ) a^+_(t)+^*_()a_(t ) ) is an operator in the space of the electric field quantum states .",
    "above , the fermion and boson field operators , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are in the heisenberg representation .",
    "the electron green s function is defined according to [ 1.6 ] g(t,,t,)= here the average @xmath13 is understood as a trace over the quantum state of the whole system , taken with the density matrix @xmath14 of the system : [ 1.7 ]  = , the action introduced in eq.([1.7 ] ) has the form : [ 1.8 ] s[^+,,v]= - _ k dt ( h_0+h_env+ h_int ) . in the above formulas @xmath15 refers to the keldysh contour , which runs from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and then backward to @xmath16 , ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , and the subscript @xmath15 refers to ordering along this contour . with no loss of generality",
    "we may take the @xmath18 initial thermal state of the system to be a product of the noninteracting electron density matrix @xmath19 and the environment density matrix @xmath20 , where @xmath19 obeys fermi - dirac statistics and @xmath20 obeys bose - einstein statistics    since the electric field is described by a set of harmonic oscillators , the trace over its quantum states can be worked out exactly .",

    "since it is coupled to electrons by two diagonal in the keldysh space vertices , the allowed positions for the keldysh component of the electron green s function are situated near the current operator , as it is shown in fig.3 by circles .",
    "those diagrams are similar to the diagrams which contribute to the leading part of the weak localization correction to conductivity , see appendix a.            now we can consider the diagrams , which have the retarded or advanced components of the electric field keldysh green s function .",
    "the diagrams are represented in fig.3 . in this case",
    "there are vertices which are not diagonal in the keldysh space of electron green s function .",
    "the keldysh component of electron green s function is given by eq.([1.19b ] ) .",
    "the dephasing correction to conductivity is given by diagrams with @xmath195 situated at the positions shown in fig.(3 ) .",
    "their sum is [ b5 ]      here we have added the term with @xmath196 to the dephasing correction to conductivity . the same term has to be subtratcted from the interaction correction .",
    "this procedure was done in @xcite , where the interaction correction was calculated for the first time .",
    "the corresponding analysis has to be done in the spirit of the present calculations taking the classical field in all oredrs of perturbation theory .",
    "now the diagram can be represented as a combination of cooperons , defined by eq.([2.11 ] ) , hikami boxes , see eq.([2.9 ] ) and eq.([b3 ] ) .",
    "unlike the terms , which have the keldysh propagator of the electric field , one vertex depends on electron energy , scattered by the electric field . in this case",
    "we can not perform integration over that energy , and we get a non  instananeous vertex in terms of the cooperon coupling to the electric field .",
    "we get : [ b6 ]      the conductivity of the system is determined by the average value with respect to the fluctuations of the electric field , see eq.([1.19 ] ) , we consider the average value of the expression in the second line of eq.([b6 ] ) . substituting the cooperons in the form of eq.([2.13 ] ) , we get for the interaction term of the cooperon action , see the second term in eq.([2.15 ] ) : [ b7 ]      we replace @xmath197 $ ] by @xmath198 $ ] and consider the difference @xmath199-s_{int}[\\tau=0,\\r(t)]$ ] as perturbation .",
    "the first order term in @xmath200 is of the same order as the higher order terms in the quantum part of the influence functional and can be neglected for our purposes .          in this appendix",
    "we discuss a recent paper by @xcite golubev and zaikin , which obtains a saturating dephasing time in the limit of zero temperature , a results very different from @xcite and @xcite . in our opinion",
    "the difference is due to uncontrolled approximations .",
    "it is important to note that the contradiction between @xcite and @xcite appears for @xmath203 , in which region the corrections to @xcite have been shown in the present paper to be negligible .    before discussing details ,",
    "some general remarks are in order .",
    "the result of @xcite is infrared divergent , see eq.(76 ) in @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we have shown that a consistent calculation does not require an extrinsic cut - off .",
    "this suggests that by dropping terms the authors of @xcite have lost some essential physics .",
    "we would also like to mention that the authors of @xcite , have referred to the caldeira ",
    "leggett model of a quantum particle coupled to environment @xcite as a similar model , which has to be treated in the same nonperturbative manner as paper @xcite claims to treat the weak localization .",
    "however , in the solution of the caldeira ",
    "leggett model , physical quantities are free of unphysical divergences . for example , eq.(83 ) in @xcite for the average value of the particle momentum is expressed as an integral with an intrinsic infrared cutoff .    in what follows",
    "we shall take some formulas from @xcite on faith , and question subsequent approximations .",
    "the following expression is used to calculate the conductivity of the electron system : [ 5.11 ] = -_-^0dt w(t ) , with @xmath204 .",
    "the evolution operator @xmath205 is [ 5.12 ] w(t)=u_l(t)u_r(t ) , where [ 5.13 ]            the conductivity defined by eq.([5.11 ] ) has to be averaged over fluctuations of the electric field to reproduce the conductivity of the interacting electron system . as the result of this averaging the authors of @xcite",
    "obtain the following effective action for the electrons : [ 5.11aa ] s[t,(t)]=s_r[t,]+is_i[t , ] , where [ 5.5 ]        c s_r[_1,_1,_2,_2]=_-t^+tdt_1_-t^+tdt_2 ( r(t_1-t_2,_1(t_1)-_1(t_2))(1 - 2n(_1(t_2),_1(t_2)))- .",

    "r(t_1-t_2,_2(t_1)-_1(t_2))(1 - 2n(_1(t_2),_1(t_2 ) ) ) ) .",
    "let us consider the conclusions that were drawn from these formulas .",
    "the authors of @xcite omitted the second and third terms on the right hand side of the expression for the imaginary part of the action @xmath210 $ ] , eq.([5.5 ] ) .",
    "their argument for doing this is that the first term increases linearly in time @xmath133 , while both terms in the second line have slower long time dependence .",
    "we agree that the first term is indeed important in the limit of very large @xmath133 .",
    "but the contribution to conductivity is determined by time @xmath211 which satisfies @xmath212 , calling the argument into question .",
    "indeed , one can see the correspondence between the action eq.([5.5 ] ) and the semiclassical calculations of @xcite , see also section iii .",
    "the form of eq.([5.5a ] ) is similar to that found by @xcite .",
    "if we use @xmath213 , ( see eq.(74 ) in @xcite ) , we get [ 5.6 ] s_i[t,(t)]~_-t^+tdt_1 ( 1-e^i((t_1)-(-t_1 ) ) ) here we have used the fact , that the integral over frequencies gives a narrow function of @xmath214 which vanishes for @xmath215 . then keeping in mind the inequality",
    "@xmath216 we can approximate that function by @xmath217 .",
    "the unity in the brackets corresponds to the term considered in @xcite .",
    "[ see their eq.(71 ) .",
    "] it originates from the first term in eq.([5.5 ] ) : the second term in eq.([5.6 ] ) , which originates from the second line in eq.([5.5 ] ) was neglected in @xcite .",
    "indeed , one is allowed to neglect it when the exponent @xmath218 is large . however , for the long wavelength ( @xmath219 ) modes which enter the integral in eq.([5.6 ] ) , one has to keep this term .",
    "the real part of the effective action contains the factor @xmath220 .",
    "the authors of @xcite neglected the time dependence of the momentum .",
    "we expect that the @xmath221dependence of the action is crucial for obtaining the correct result .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath222 is a sharp function of momentum near the fermi surface of the electrons .",
    "the approximation of a sharp function by its value at a particular point is at best dangerous .",
    "we will present arguments which raise questions about its validity . for this purpose we rewrite the real part of the action @xmath223 , eq.([5.8 ] ) in another form : [ 5.10 ]      eq.([5.10 ] ) is derived for the time reversed paths @xmath224 , that is for the same class of trajectories as eq.(68 ) in @xcite .",
    "we represented it in the most transparent form , so that a complicated factor @xmath225 is taken at the same moment of time for all terms of the integrand in eq.([5.10 ] ) .",
    "we see , that if @xmath226 is a constant or an even function of time @xmath133 , the real part of the effective action vanishes . in the opposite case , when @xmath226 is odd ,",
    "the real part of the effective action is of the same order , as the imaginary part , taken at @xmath227 .",
    "we can introduce the eigenstates of the system without interaction . in the interaction picture",
    "we have states @xmath228 , where @xmath84 is the energy of the state , @xmath229 labels the degenerate levels corresponding to @xmath84 .",
    "we have the following equality : [ 5.15 ] < , j , t|,j,t>=_, _ jje^-i(t - t ) . in the eigenstate basis",
    "the density matrix can be represented as [ 5.16 ] =     then , according to eq.([5.11 ] , [ 5.12 ] ) we have to evaluate [ 5.17 ] m_jj(,)=_|_i|~t , j_i , here the sum over the initial states is extended over the energy range , comparable with the temperature of the system and @xmath230 means average over the electric field fluctuations .",
    "the evolution operators , eq.(5.13 ) , are understood as an expansion of the exponential functions .",
    "then the right hand side of eq.5.17 is a series of matrix elements , which we denote as @xmath231 , where @xmath232 shows the order of the expansion of @xmath233 or @xmath234 . as an example let us take the third term of the series for @xmath233 and the first term of @xmath234 .",
    "we have [ 5.18 ]    c m^(2,0)_jj(,)=-_|_i| ~t , j_i _ 0^t dt_1 _ 0^t_1 dt_2 + < _ i , j_i,0|,j,t>= + _ _ 2,j_2_|_i| ~t ,",

    "@xmath238 is identically zero and @xmath239 does not contribute to the above matrix element due to causality .    in ref .",
    "@xcite only the imaginary part of the dielectric susceptibility of the electron system contributes to the weak localization correction .",
    "that is why we consider only the part of the matrix element @xmath240 , which contains @xmath241 .",
    "[ it was shown in @xcite , that terms with @xmath242 contribute to the interaction correction to weak localization , and do not contribute to the dephasing correction to conductivity . ] since the characteristic values of the upper limits of time integrals in eq.([5.18 ] ) are of the order of dephasing time @xmath243 , the integral over @xmath244 vanishes , unless @xmath245 .",
    "we have @xmath246 and consider the high frequencies @xmath247 .",
    "since @xmath248 , we see that the contribution of high frequencies is exponentially suppressed .",
    "one can repeat this analysis for other terms @xmath231 and observe the same type of cancellation of high frequency contributions to the conductivity in any order of perturbation theory .",
    "a similar discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "note , that one can take sum @xmath249 this expression reduces to the quantum correction found in @xcite , but in this case one has to perform a sum over the spectrum of the disordered electron system .",
    "the expression would be divergent at @xmath250 . to cure this divergence one should sum all orders of perturbation theory or introduce an external magnetic field to remove the long wave divergence .",
    "we emphasize again that the paper @xcite predicts a saturation in the dephasing rate when the inequality @xmath246 is still satisfied .",
    "our discussion in this appendix is based exactly on the same inequality . and",
    "in this case we see that terms in the second line of eq.([5.5 ] ) have to be kept and there is no contribution from electromagnetic modes with excitation energy much greater than temperature .",
