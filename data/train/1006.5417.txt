    "the standard model ( sm ) has its predictive power in neutron beta decay ( n@xmath3d ) afflicted by the fact that it has two free parameters , namely , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( the ratio of the two leading form factors at zero momentum transfer ) . in order to make precise predictions ,",

    "however , it must be stressed that our analysis is independent of @xmath19 and its error bar @xmath20 and @xmath7 .",

    "the important remark here is that there is no theoretical uncertainty in @xmath7 at this level of precision .",
    "the reason for this is that the uncertainty introduced by the model dependence of the contributions of @xmath32 to the radiative corrections is common to the numerator and denominator of @xmath7 and cancels away at the @xmath14 level .",
