    "lyman-@xmath0 blobs , discovered by steidel et al .  ( 2000 ) , consist of amoebic structures emitting profusely at the rest - frame wavelength of the lyman-@xmath0 emission line , 1216 . whilst these very large lyman-@xmath0 emitting haloes are reminiscent of the extended emission line regions observed around powerful high redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. villar - martn et al . , 2007b ) , they typically have less than 1% of the associated radio flux , raising the question as to what ionises the neutral hydrogen in order to enable the emission of lyman-@xmath0 photons .",
    "three of the most plausible explanations for this are :    * labs contain hidden qsos ( e.g. haiman & rees 2001 ; weidinger , mller & fynbo 2004 ; weidinger et al . 2005 ; barrio et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "the luminous nature of labs with typically @xmath8 erg s@xmath4 in the lyman-@xmath0 emission line alone suggests that the hard spectra , and bolometric luminosity of qsos are prime candidates to power such a galaxy s emission . *",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 emission comes from a dust - enshrouded , extreme starburst galaxy with a large scale superwind due to large numbers of luminous and short - lived ob stars ( e.g. taniguchi & shioya 2000 ; ohyama et al .  2003 ; wilman et al .",

    "a cold accretion scenario invokes collisional excitation and re - radiation of accreting neutral gas to power the profuse lyman-@xmath0 emission extended over the halo .",
    "the sources of ionisation residing within these galaxies ( which are sometimes extended over many tens of kiloparsecs ) , are currently thought to be diverse .",
    "this result is due to the discovery of a 200kpc lab in dey et al.(2005 ) associated with a 24@xmath1 m detection attributed to an obscured agn , to the discovery by chapman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of a highly luminous sub - millimetre source ( with @xmath10 ) indicative of a very high star formation rate ( @xmath11 yr@xmath4 ) residing within lab1 from steidel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and to the non - detection of any apparent source of ionization associated with a lab in the goods - south field by nilsson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "smith & jarvis ( 2007 ) discovered only the second known lyman-@xmath0 blob thought to be ionized by the process of cold accretion , residing at @xmath12 . in figure",
    "[ blob_contour ] we show the sloan - g band image of the lab from our survey , overlaid with a contour map of the heii  narrow - band data , sensitive to lyman-@xmath0 emission at the redshift of the lab .",
    "this lab was found to be extended over at least @xmath2kpc , with a lyman-@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath13 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "33@xmath14on a side and north is up while east is to the left .",
    "the object to the north and east of the core of the lyman-@xmath0 emission is a low - redshift interloper , identified as being at @xmath15 due to the presence of [ oii]@xmath16 , [ neiv]@xmath17 , mgii@xmath18 , and [ cii]@xmath19 emission in our optical spectroscopy ( for more details see smith & jarvis , 2007 ) . ]",
    "the lab in question is located at 17@xmath2009@xmath2152.3@xmath22 + 59@xmath2313@xmath24 21.72@xmath14  ( j2000 ) , on the very edge of the extragalactic component of the _",

    "was covered with any s / n at all only in the 4.5@xmath1 m band ( irac channel 2 - lacy et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "in any case , the fls observations were not deep enough for the type of study proposed here ( see below ) .",
    "agn themselves are expected to be particularly dusty due to the torus invoked by schemes of agn unification ( antonucci , 1993 ) to explain the different observed species ; this also makes them bright at mid - infrared wavelengths since the warm torus is thought to reprocess the x - ray and uv photons emitted by the central engine .",
    "indeed , through their mid - infrared emission , powerful agn ( quasars ) can be identified up to high redshifts ( e.g. lacy et al .",
    ", 2004 , martnez - sansigre et al . ,",
    "2005 ) , even when they are so heavily obscured that they are undetected at x - ray energies ( e.g. polletta et al . , 2006 , lacy et al . , 2007 , martnez - sansigre et al . , 2007 ) .    in the event",
    "that there is a 24@xmath1 m detection residing within the lab , through studying its ir sed we would be able to distinguish between an obscured agn and the starburst sed that would be expected if there was extensive ongoing star formation in the lab counterpart galaxy .",
    "labs ionized by a starburst are found to have very high star formation rates based on their fluxes at sub - millimetre wavelengths equivalent to @xmath9  yr@xmath4 ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "2001 , geach et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "the recent high - resolution sub - millimetre array ( sma ) observations of matsuda et al .",
    "( 2007 ) did not detect lab1 from steidel ( 2000 ) , despite the bright sub - millimetre continuum measured by chapman et al .",
    "matsuda et al .  ( 2007 ) argued that the sub - millimetre continuum was most likely resolved out by the high spatial resolution interferometric sma observations , suggesting that the spatial extent of the sub - millimetre emitting region was @xmath2530kpc , comparable to the extent of the lyman-@xmath0 emission itself .",
    "this reinforces the super - wind model for this lab , in which rapid star formation within the halo is widely distributed , and could be powering the lyman-@xmath0 emission . observing this new halo from smith & jarvis ( 2007 ) at millimetre wavelengths",
    "then provides an additional constraint on the properties of the ionizing source residing within .    here",
    "we present the results of two independent tests for the presence of starbursting or agn components enshrouded within the structure .",
    "this paper is organised as follows ; in section [ observations ] we describe our _ spitzer space telescope _ and mambo-2 observations , while in section [ sec : results ] we present our results , including our improved constraints on this galaxy s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , and section [ conclusions ] presents our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "the ab magnitude system is used ( oke & gunn , 1983 ) , and a standard cosmology is assumed in which @xmath26 = 71 km s@xmath4 , @xmath27 = 0.27 and @xmath28 = 0.73 ( dunkley et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "we observed the region centred on this lab in 21 dithered 30s exposures in irac channels 1 & 3 , and 33 @xmath29 30s in irac channels 2 & 4 ( 10 and 16 minutes in total , respectively ) .",
    "we designed our 24@xmath1 m mips observations to use a seven - point jittering positional offset algorithm with offsets corresponding to the six nodes of a hexagon , plus the central position .",
    "we observed at each position for 501s , resulting in a total of 3507s on source .",
    "the jittering pattern was employed to ensure effective chip artefact rejection , and result in a reasonably uniform depth over the central 5@xmath30  of the field of view .",
    "no new mips channel 2 & 3 data were acquired .    these observations were carried out under program number 40957 ; the irac data in channels 1 & 3 were observed on aug 8@xmath31 , 2007 , with channels 2 & 4 observed on august 12@xmath31 , and the mips 24@xmath1 m data observed on august 22@xmath32 .",
    "the raw data were reduced , and photometric and astrometric solutions were applied automatically using the spitzer science center pipeline version s16.1.0 .",
    "the resulting frames are calibrated to units of surface brightness ( mjy sr@xmath4 ) .",
    "the reduced irac images , centred on the lab counterpart galaxy ( circled in black ) can be seen in figure [ iracch1234 ] .    the mips pipeline - reduced frames were reduced in seven separate parent images due to the target jitter pattern employed .",
    "they were aligned according to their astrometric solutions using the iraf task wregister , before being stacked using imcombine ( also in iraf ) .",
    "the stacked mips data centred on the position of the lab ( again circled in black ) , are displayed in figure [ mipsch1 ] .    to extract meaningful fluxes from the irac / mips data ,",
    "a conversion factor must be applied to convert from mjy sr@xmath4 to something more useful , usually @xmath1jy pixel@xmath4 .",
    "the conversion factor must take into account both the difference between mjy and @xmath1jy , and the difference between a steradian and the area of each pixel ( see http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/fls/ for further details ) .",
    "since spitzer irac imaging data are calibrated to known standard source observations measured in 10@xmath14apertures ( for mips this is 35@xmath14 ) , some correction to the photometry is necessary when measuring fluxes though apertures of different sizes due to the varying amounts of the point spread function falling within the extent of the aperture . for a 4@xmath14  radius aperture in irac this factor has values of 1.074 , 1.075 , 1.080 & 1.150 for channels 1 to 4 ( 3.6 - 8.0@xmath1 m ) , whereas for mips channel 1 ( 24@xmath1 m band ) , the factor is @xmath332.4 , due to the much larger psf in mips data .",
    "the mips @xmath34 m data have a 5@xmath5 detection limit varying from @xmath35jy at the centre of the field of view to @xmath36jy towards the edges .",
    "we have the sensitivity to detect sfrs as low as 200  yr@xmath4 at 5@xmath5 in our 24@xmath1 m data ( although this does depend on the exact sed assumed , due to the relationship between 24@xmath1 m flux and far infra - red luminosity ) , and the accompanying irac sensitivity to distinguish between agn and starbursting components , were they detected in the 24@xmath1 m band .",
    "the lyman @xmath0 halo was observed between 19@xmath31 january and 3@xmath37 march 2008 using the max - planck millimetre bolometer array ( mambo-2 , kreysa et al . , 1998 )",
    "instrument at the iram 30 m telescope at pico de veleta , spain .",
    "the effective frequency of mambo-2 is 250ghz , which corresponds to 1.2 mm , with a beam fwhm of 10.7@xmath14 .",
    "the observations were carried out in mostly clear conditions with atmospheric opacity @xmath38 and low sky noise ( @xmath370  mjy  beam@xmath4 , with most of the scans having @xmath3940  mjy  beam@xmath4 ) .",
    "the targets were centred on the most sensitive pixel ( number 20 ) and standard on - off observations were carried out with a wobbler throw in azimuth of 35 - 45@xmath14 , at a rate of 2  hz to enable effective sky subtraction",
    ". individual scans of typically 20 minutes were carried out , and the total integration time was 212 minutes .    to enable effective sky - subtraction , reduce systematic errors and avoid false positive detections , we varied the wobbler throw between 35 , 40 and 45@xmath14 , and scans were conducted at different times on different days . as a result it is very unlikely for the sky observations to repeatedly fall on bright nearby sources . prior to each scan , pointing corrections were made by observing a nearby bright source , j1638@xmath40573 .",
    "the focus and opacity were checked regularly ( typically every 2  hours ) and the focus was generally found to be stable .",
    "gain calibration was performed using neptune , uranus or mars , and monitored regularly using very bright millimetre sources ( typically @xmath415 jy ) ; the resulting absolute flux scale has an uncertainty of @xmath4220% .",
    "the data were reduced by using the mopsic software ( zylka 1998 ) ; with these new data we have the sensitivity to effectively distinguish between the three most plausible sources of ionization .",
    "due to the crowded nature of the field around the lab caused by the depth of the data , 4@xmath14apertures were preferred over larger options to prevent the inclusion of flux from neighbouring sources ( although this was not possible for the mambo-2 observations , due to the 10.7@xmath14  fwhm of the beam ) .",
    "the fluxes were calculated using the function aper from the idl astronomy users library , which computes photometry in specified apertures and background annuli .",
    "aper accounts precisely for the different contributions of different square pixels overlapping on circular apertures , of greater importance here due to the comparatively large pixel size ( 1.2@xmath14 ) .",
    "photometry of the lab counterpart is presented in table [ photometry ] .",
    ".photometric data for the lab .",
    "magnitudes are measured in apertures with 4@xmath43 radii ( with the exception of the 1.2 mm data , for which the beam fwhm is 10.7@xmath14 ) , and where they are limits , they are to 1@xmath5 . the 1.2 mm flux is calculated as detailed in the text , while the radio limits are calculated according to the local rms noise in the images . the large error in the heii narrow - band filter",
    "has several causes ; the faintness of the lab , the difficulty in fitting the sky background due to the very extended nature of the lab , and the presence of the nearby low-@xmath44 interloper to the north and east of the lab counterpart galaxy all contribute .",
    "some values for the longer wavelength data are given in units of jansky ( 1 jy = 10@xmath45w  hz@xmath4 ) , which is deemed more appropriate . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ bestfit ]    since the old ssp in the maraston model fitting scheme is older ( 2 gyr ) than the old ssp used in the best fit in the bruzual - charlot scheme , one would expect it to be more quiescent .",
    "that being the case , a larger stellar mass would be required to produce the same luminosity due to the death of the more luminous ( and _ shorter - lived _ ) stars .",
    "the different mass estimates from the bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and maraston ( 2005 ) schemes are not unexpected , since one of the main disagreements between these two models of seds relates to the stellar masses implied ( e.g. maraston , 2005 ) .     for composite bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and maraston ( 2005 ) simple stellar populations ( solid and dotted lines , respectively ) .",
    "the age of the best - fit old ssp component is shown on the abscissa , with the age of the best - fit young ssp component represented by the colours ( see legend ) . ]",
    "the variation of best - fit @xmath46 as a function of input models is displayed in figure [ chi_dist_iracnorm ] for the two fitting regimes .",
    "a clear minimum occurs for the combination of 10 myr & 0.8 gyr bruzual & charlot templates .",
    "the preference for this model over other similar combinations is small , but this combination is the best fit , in agreement with the results of smith & jarvis ( 2007 ) , which suggested that the counterpart galaxy was best described by a combination of a young and an old simple stellar population .",
    "the bruzual & charlot models ( 2003 - solid lines ) better approximate our data than those of maraston ( 2005 - dotted lines ) , reflected by the lower values of @xmath46 .",
    "maraston models older than the age of the universe are included in this analysis due to the coarse sampling of population ages above 1.5 gyr , to enable the models to demonstrate a minimum @xmath46 value .",
    "thus we conclude that the host galaxy is well - described by a composite simple stellar population , with little or no evidence for additional ( e.g. agn ) components .",
    "we also note that the composite stellar population is considerably ( i.e. orders of magnitude ) less luminous between 200 & 912  than the elvis ( 1994 ) agn sed , and therefore also incapable of powering the lyman-@xmath0 halo .",
    "with our new irac , mips and mambo-2 data , as well as our new deep u , b & v band observations , we have demonstrated that the counterpart galaxy associated with the newly - discoverd lab announced in smith & jarvis ( 2007 ) is well - described by a composite stellar population . using this new multi - wavelength data - set",
    ", we find no plausible evidence for the presence either of an obscured active galactic nucleus or of an energetic starburst that would be required to ionize the neutral hydrogen gas in galaxy - wide super - wind schemes .",
    "the most likely source of ionization for this particular highly luminous lyman-@xmath0 halo is a `` cold accretion '' scenario , which may be able to supply sufficient energy for this profuse emission without invoking either of the other power sources suggested in the literature ( see fardal et al .",
    "2001 , dijkstra , et al . , 2006a , b , 2007 ) .",
    "we also place further constraints on the host galaxy , and find it to be well described by composite simple stellar populations with total masses of 3.42 @xmath47 or 4.36 @xmath48 , depending on the models used .",
