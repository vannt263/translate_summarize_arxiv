    "it is well established that a key goal to understanding the growth process is to find ( in the early , aggregation regime ) the size of the smallest stable cluster ( denoted @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the size of the critical nucleus , the largest unstable cluster @xcite ) . while there are a few methods used traditionally to do so , more recent work",
    "has shown that it is particularly fruitful to consider the distribution of the area of capture zones @xcite , i.e. voronoi ( proximity ) cells constructed from the island centers .",
    "[ f : voronoi ] . in particular",
    ", we shall see that this analysis provides information about the critical nucleus size @xmath2 , i.e.  the size of the largest island unstable to decay ( so that the size of the smallest cluster that is assumed not to decay is @xmath5 ) , a crucial ingredient in models of growth processes . for random nucleation centers , i.e.  poisson - voronoi ( pv ) diagrams , the capture - zone distribution ( czd ) is expected to follow a gamma distribution ( @xmath6d ) @xcite , @xmath7    more generally we have argued @xcite , drawing from experiences analyzing the terrace - width distributions of vicinal surfaces @xcite , that the czd is better described by the single - parameter generalized wigner distribution ( gwd ) : @xmath8 where @xmath1 is the cz area divided by its average value ( so that @xmath9 ) ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants @xcite that assure normalization and unit mean , respectively , of @xmath12 . the derivation is based on a fokker - planck approach rooted in an overdamped langevin analysis of cell size in which an external pressure from other cells hinders a cell from growing much larger than average while an entropic force impedes it from getting much smaller .",
    "the entropic term is rooted in the mean - field assumption that the island nucleation rate is proportional to @xmath13 , the product of the number @xmath14 of adatoms and the density of critical nuclei ( @xmath15 ) @xcite , leading to the prediction that @xmath16 in two dimensions ( 2d ) [ and higher ] . in 2d , which is the experimentally relevant case and so the focus of this short paper , this approximation turns out to be inadequate since nucleation occurs preferentially near cz boundaries rather than uniformly @xcite .",

    "as discussed in the following , more sophisticated analysis in 2d points to @xmath17 as better , consistent with most large - scale simulations and experiments .",
    "the need to go beyond our mean field fokker - planck analysis ( and its key finding of @xmath16 ) @xcite were made evident by extensive simulations by amar s @xcite and evans s @xcite groups .",

    "they find better fits to czds with @xmath24 than with @xmath25 .",
    "the dependence on coverage ( between 0.1 and 0.4 ml ) is negligible , but there is some dependence on @xmath26 and on which of the two models of point islands is used .",
    "they also find better scaling ( with @xmath26 ) of the peak height of the czd using @xmath24 , and comparable results for the two models .",

    "<S> we have argued that the capture - zone distribution ( czd ) in submonolayer growth can be well described by the generalized wigner distribution ( gwd ) @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the cz area divided by its average value . </S>",
    "<S> this approach offers arguably the best method to find the critical nucleus size @xmath2 , since @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> various analytical and numerical investigations , which we discuss , show that the simple gwd expression is inadequate in the tails of the distribution , it does account well for the central regime @xmath4 , where the data is sufficiently large to be reliably accessible experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize and catalog the many experiments in which this method has been applied . </S>"
