    ", one can qualitatively explain such a behaviour by an influence of the values @xmath126 on the dielectric functions for large enough integers @xmath82 . hence the peaks for the @xmath121 caused by contribution to the impedance ( [ sf_imp2 ] ) of terms with @xmath127 in case of the odd integers @xmath82 , are shifted and disappear in quantum theory in comparison with the classical spatial dispersion approach .",

    "it has been detected that for the frequencies of order and larger than the electron plasma frequency and related to the visible and ultraviolet ranges , the power coefficients in quantum approach have the same qualitative behavior as in the classical spatial dispersion degenerate plasma theory .",
