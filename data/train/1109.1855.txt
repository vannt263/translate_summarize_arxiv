    "@xcite as a candidate system for a more general experimental method .",

    "for example , heavier systems will have a higher density of states compared to lighter systems with a similar electronic potential . as alluded to earlier ,",
    "higher density of states is a favorable feature for this method as it increases the likelihood for near - degeneracies to occur between vibrational levels . at the same time , heavier systems are also known to have larger relativistic effects and , presumably , larger sensitivities to @xmath0 variation .    as another example , we note the close relationship between the proposal of demille _",
    "et al . _  and a previous proposal of flambaum and kozlov @xcite .",
    "flambaum and kozlov suggested using nearly degenerate vibrational levels associated with different fine structure components of an electronic multiplet , specifically focusing on levels near the bottom of the spectrum . while allowing for large relative sensitivity , this particular method does not promote enhanced absolute sensitivity .",
