    "fluctuation energies are well - known from the main example of the zero - point energy , an energy contribution that depends on quantum fluctuations and is evaluated for the ground state .",
    "heuristically , the ground state has a non - vanishing energy , in contrast to the classical theory , because the uncertainty principle does not allow both the position and the momentum fluctuation to be zero .",
    "while expectation values of position and momentum can minimize the classical energy function , quantum fluctuations provide an additional zero - point energy .",
    "one can see the relationship to quantum fluctuations clearly by writing the energy expectation value of the harmonic oscillator , in an arbitrary state , as @xmath0 in a stationary state , one has @xmath1 , and only the fluctuation terms remain . if one inserts the ground - state values @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one obtains the zero - point energy @xmath4 .",
    "although such fluctuation terms can contribute to any state of a system in quantum mechanics , they are usually not considered significant for semiclassical states . in this article",
    ", we discuss the analogous notion for quantum cosmology .",
    "the situation is then rather different because the systems considered in this field do not give rise to a natural ground state .",
    "the more - general notion of fluctuation energies is therefore preferred compared to zero - point energies .",
    "quantum fluctuations ( or other moments of a state ) may not seem to contribute a significant amount compared with the total matter energy contained in the universe .",
    "however , several quantum - geometry effects have been suggested for quantizations of space - time . some of them , for instance in loop quantum cosmology , imply corrections to the classical friedmann equation which are able to cancel the classical matter energy in certain regimes . if a fluctuation energy is left after the cancellation , it may have some influence on the dynamics of a universe model .",
    "the main example for such a cancellation effect is the `` bounce '' scenario proposed in loop quantum cosmology , based on the modified ( spatially flat ) friedmann equation @xmath5 with a quantum - gravity parameter @xmath6 which one can think of as being close to the planck density @xcite .",
    "( this equation has been derived in a reliable way for models sourced by a free , massless scalar @xcite . ) near @xmath7 , quantum - geometry corrections may cancel the classical term of the matter energy density . a solution with @xmath8 at one time then becomes possible , leading to a turn - around of the scale factor at high density .",
    "if there is a fluctuation - dependent contribution to ( [ modfried ] ) , viewed as an effective equation of quantum cosmology , it may become significant near @xmath7 and might change the dynamics as well as the density realized at the bounce .",
    "as it turned out , loop quantum cosmology is not viable as a stand - alone universe model .",
    "the modification seen in the isotropic background equation ( [ modfried ] ) also affects equations for inhomogeneous fields . as a consequence",
    ", one can show that the underlying space - time structure is drastically modified compared to the classical one @xcite .",
    "( it remains consistent and anomaly - free , presenting an effective model of quantum space - time . )",
    "these effects are visible only when inhomogeneity is included in the equations in a consistent way , paying due attention to covariance and the gauge transformations it is related to . if one were to fix the gauge before considering quantum corrections or to implement other restrictions of the gauge structure , these space - time effects would be missed .",
    "exactly homogeneous minisuperspace models or models in which inhomogeneous modes are added on to the minisuperspace dynamics therefore can not be considered reliable .",
    "( see @xcite for detailed discussions . )",
    "the main example for unexpected quantum space - time effects in loop quantum gravity is signature change at high density @xcite : space - time turns into a quantum version of 4-dimensional euclidean space before the density @xmath6 is reached .",
    "accordingly , equations for inhomogeneous fields in this regime are elliptic rather than hyperbolic and do not allow well - posed initial - value problems .",
    "there is no causal structure and no deterministic evolution through high density , implying that an interpretation of minisuperspace dynamics as bounce models , according to equations such as ( [ modfried ] ) , is incorrect .",
    "nevertheless , some properties of background solutions in loop quantum cosmology are of interest for details of the signature - change transition at high density . in this context",
    ", we analyze fluctuation energies contributing to ( [ modfried ] ) .",
    "we present two applications in section  [ s : app ] : an estimate of the severeness of instabilities of an initial - value formulation in the euclidean phase , and a derivation of several relationships between moments that help to explain some features seen in numerical evolutions of wave functions @xcite .",
    "an appendix provides more - technical details on expectation values and moments of observables in physical states .",

    "acting on states @xmath18 , on which the momentum @xmath19 turns into a derivative operator , we obtain a wheeler  dewitt equation @xcite of the form @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "to be specific , we have chosen one ordering of the non - commuting operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 without implying any uniqueness of this choice . as will be shown below , it implies convenient solvability features .    in loop quantum cosmology ,",
    "the derivative @xmath24 is replaced by a difference operator .",

    ", we may assume this value to equal one .",

    "the parameter @xmath28 is a label for different discretization schemes , so that a quantization of the power @xmath29 becomes equidistant .",
    "this parameter can heuristically be related to the dynamical refinement of spatial lattices underlying states in loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the most common choice is @xmath30 for equidistant volume @xmath31 @xcite , but it is not unique .",
    "the variables @xmath32 traditionally used in wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantum cosmology correspond to @xmath33 .",
    "once a value for @xmath28 has been chosen , the step - size of the corresponding equi - spaced variable @xmath27 is determined by another parameter @xmath34 , which appears in shift operators @xmath35 .",
    "one then replaces the classical @xmath36 in the friedmann equation by a suitable combination of exponentials , such as @xmath37 times some power of @xmath27 , and quantizes them to shift operators .",
    "( sometimes , the first replacement step is done only implicitly . ) instead of the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation , the classical constraint turns into a difference equation @xcite of the form @xmath38 for wave functions @xmath39 .    in ( [ wdw ] ) and ( [ diff ] )",
    ", the ordering we wrote enjoys special properties : it makes the system harmonic and free of quantum back - reaction @xcite .",
    "we note that this property is a mathematical feature , which by no means implies that the ordering is preferred on physical grounds .",
    "however , it is important even for a physical analysis because one can study more - general orderings by perturbation theory around the harmonic model @xcite ( much as one determines the physics of interacting quantum field theories by perturbation theory around a free theory . )",
    "the absence of quantum back - reaction makes it convenient to compute fluctuation energies .",
    "factor orderings other than the one used in ( [ wdw ] ) or ( [ diff ] ) imply additional fluctuation terms which one can compute once the harmonic model is understood .    by solving the wheeler  dewitt equation or the difference equation",
    ", we obtain `` relational '' wave functions of the form @xmath18 or @xmath39 instead of time - dependent ones .",
    "in this situation , there is no clear meaning of energy eigenvalues where zero - point or fluctuation energies could show up .",
    "nevertheless , expectation values computed for @xmath40 at fixed @xmath9 in a solution to the difference equation may be subject to fluctuation - dependent quantum corrections compared to the classical relationship between @xmath27 and @xmath9 . by comparing the behavior of the expectation value with the classical scale factor , these quantum corrections can be interpreted as additional energy contributions in an effective friedmann equation .    as already mentioned , the ordering matters because re - ordering terms imply additional quantum corrections which depend explicitly on @xmath41 and can compete with fluctuation terms .",
    "several other popular choices exist in loop quantum cosmology , which follow the same principles of @xcite , leading to ( [ diff ] ) , but quantize the relevant operators differently .",
    "of special importance for our purpose will be the treatment of the energy operator provided by the free , massless scalar , a quantization of the classical expression ( [ rhofree ] ) .",
    "corresponding operators have been defined in different ways and analyzed for instance regarding their boundedness properties @xcite .",
    "when fluctuation terms are interpreted as energy contributions , their precise form depends on how one defines a density expectation value .",
    "one may , for instance , define a density operator of the form @xmath42 ( provided the volume operator @xmath43 is invertible , which is not always the case and sometimes requires additional corrections as per @xcite ) . in some suitable state",
    ", this operator then gives rise to an expectation value @xmath44 which one may take as a measure for the energy density .",
    "alternatively , and perhaps more reliably if one considers that canonical quantum gravity provides operators for matter hamiltonians but not densities , one may define a measure for the energy density as @xmath45 with the energy operator @xmath46 .",
    "these two expressions differ by fluctuation terms , as shown by an expansion in moments of the state used . for this purpose , and also for later use , we follow @xcite and introduce the moments @xmath47 using totally symmetric ( weyl ) ordering .",
    "( more generally , we should refer to our @xmath27 instead of @xmath48 . for the present example , we assume @xmath30 , so that the volume , up to a constant factor , is one of our basic variables . ) for @xmath49 , we have fluctuations and covariance parameters , such as @xmath50 .",
    "any expression defined as the expectation value of some weyl - ordered operator @xmath51 formed from our basic operators can be expanded in moments by a formal taylor series @xmath52 ( if @xmath53 is a weyl - ordered polynomial in basic operators , this expression is exact . if @xmath53 is not weyl - ordered , it can be written as a sum of weyl - ordered terms some of which have explicit factors of @xmath41 @xcite . for each of them , ( [ o ] ) can be used . ) for the density expressions , we have @xmath54 to which fluctuations and other moments contribute in different ways .",
    "we extend our introductory example of the harmonic oscillator in order to discuss a general notion of fluctuation energies relevant for quantum cosmology .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can now be recognized as an example of the expansion ( [ o ] ) in terms of moments , which in this case is exact because the harmonic energy operator is a polynomial in basic operators . for a general state ,",
    "the energy expectation value is obtained as the sum of the classical energy evaluated in expectation values of basic operators , and a fluctuation term . for an energy eigenstate ,",
    "only the fluctuation term remains and determines the energy eigenvalue in this state .",

    "these considerations show that zero - point energies are just a special case of fluctuation energies as they follow from a moment expansion ( [ o ] ) . in this form",
    ", they can be computed also for quantum cosmology , where we can use ( [ o ] ) to expand a constraint operator @xmath16 instead of the energy .",
    "there will then be fluctuation terms from both the gravity and the matter contribution of the constraint .",
    "the former are more sensitive to the quantization approach used , as well as to factor - ordering ambiguities .",
    "the computation of fluctuation energies can be done exactly in harmonic models .",
    "crucial ingredients , realized by the harmonic oscillator as the prime example , are a polynomial hamiltonian for the expansion ( [ o ] ) to be exact , with a degree of at most two in canonical variables .",
    "the latter property ensures that the moments obey evolution equations by which they couple only to other moments of the same order . for more - complicated systems",
    ", one can use perturbation theory provided one can find a harmonic model sufficiently close to the one of interest .",
    "( an example for a large class of such applications is the low - energy effective action for anharmonic systems @xcite . )",
    "the harmonic oscillator is not close to all systems studied in quantum cosmology .",
    "but there are substitutes , which one may consider as harmonic models of cosmology .",
    "the procedure of canonical effective equations , based on ( [ o ] ) and ( [ dodt ] ) , is easier to perform if one can work with a hamiltonian rather than a constraint .",
    "we will therefore start with the technique of deparameterization , allowing one to reformulate constrained dynamics as formal evolution with respect to one of the degrees of freedom . after discussing deparameterized harmonic models",
    ", we will turn to additional ingredients required for a direct treatment of constraints .",
    "the models of interest here can easily be deparameterized by considering the scalar @xmath9 as an evolution parameter .",
    "if it is free and massless , the momentum @xmath10 is a constant of motion and never becomes zero .",
    "accordingly , the time derivative @xmath63 is non - zero , and @xmath64 is a monotonic function . instead of @xmath65 ,",
    "one may therefore use @xmath9 as a unique parameter along dynamical trajectories .",
    "equations of motion are then generated canonically by the function @xmath66 obtained by solving the constraint for @xmath10 : if we write the constraint as @xmath67 , the poisson - bracket relationship @xmath68 implies @xmath69 for any expression independent of @xmath9 , up to terms that vanish when @xmath13 .    for the free , massless scalar in a spatially flat frw universe , we start with the hamiltonian constraint expressed in the canonical pair @xmath70 , which can be written as @xmath71 it is sufficient to set the second parenthesis equal to zero ( amounting to a @xmath27-dependent choice of the time coordinate ) , which we do together with a simple canonical transformation from @xmath72 to @xmath73 to absorb some factors .",
    "the @xmath74-hamiltonian @xmath75 is then a quadratic function @xmath76 , or @xmath77 for the loop modification . without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose the positive sign in what follows .      in a wheeler ",
    "dewitt quantization , there are operators for both @xmath40 and @xmath78 , and we can quantize @xmath79 in a symmetric ordering .",
    "( for @xmath33 , ( [ cfact ] ) then leads to ( [ wdw ] ) . )",
    "as indicated in this expression , we drop the absolute value , with the following justification : the operator @xmath80 is preserved by evolution generated by @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , a state initially supported on the positive part of the spectral decomposition of @xmath80 will always be supported on this set . for evolution equations ( [ dodt ] ) without the absolute value in @xmath82 ,",
    "it is then sufficient to ensure initial states to be supported on the positive part of the spectrum , which can always be achieved by projection .    with this simplification",
    ", @xmath83 is a quadratic polynomial , giving an exact expansion ( [ o ] ) : @xmath84 with a `` fluctuation '' energy @xmath85 ( which is rather a covariance ) . in order to see the meaning of this energy , we transform the deparameterized equation ( [ pphiwdw ] ) back to a constraint , or an effective friedmann equation .",
    "we compute @xmath86 using ( [ dodt ] ) .",
    "we transform the @xmath74-derivative to a proper - time derivative by @xmath87 .",

    "we could then write @xmath94 which does have a moment term . however , even if one uses the fact that @xmath95 and @xmath10 are constant , this equation is not a closed effective equation because @xmath96 or @xmath97 is in general independent of @xmath98 or @xmath88 .",
    "the situation is more interesting for the constraints of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "these expressions are not polynomial in @xmath70 , but they can be made so if one transforms to non - canonical variables @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",

    "it may seem surprising that @xmath130 is added to the energy density , rather than just @xmath128 .",
    "however , using @xmath131 , we observe that there are two factors of @xmath132 in @xmath130 which transform the fluctuation energy @xmath128 ( or rather @xmath133 ) from the @xmath9-frame to the @xmath65-frame , according to the tensor - transformation law @xmath134 in isotropic models , in which only the time coordinate is being changed .",

    "this turning point has been interpreted as a bounce , but since consistent inhomogeneous extensions of the background model show that space - time turns into a quantum version of 4-dimensional euclidean space at high density , there is no deterministic evolution and the bounce picture is incorrect . instead of using an initial - value formulation ,",
    "the euclidean phase with elliptic mode equations requires a boundary - value problem including the @xmath65-direction .",

    "we will make use only of @xmath342 we can eliminate the two moments involving @xmath252 : @xmath343 the latter allows us to write @xmath344 as @xmath345      the moment @xmath259 is initially defined as a kinematical moment , in which @xmath219 and @xmath40 need not be ordered symmetrically in an explicit way because these are independent and commuting operators . once we transition to physical states by solving effective constraints , we expect the ordering to become important because @xmath346 does not commute with @xmath40 .",
    "we start with @xmath347 as a kinematical moment , which becomes @xmath348\\rangle\\ ] ] in an explicit symmetric ordering . for physical moments involving @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath219 must be ordered to the right so that we can substitute @xmath337 on physical states .",
    "( if @xmath219 appears on the left , one would have to use adjointness relations which depend on the hilbert space used , kinematical or physical , and can not be taken for granted at the effective level because @xmath346 is not a basic operator . )",
    "the commutator in ( [ qpcomplex ] ) then provides the imaginary contribution found in ( [ complexmoments ] ) .",
    "while @xmath349 as the covariance of two independent variables is no longer defined for physical states , one can interpret it as a composite moment in which @xmath219 is understood as the operator @xmath350 .",
    "there should then be a physical moment for it , which , unlike ( [ complexmoments ] ) must be real . a simple guess suggests that the physical moment is just the real part of ( [ complexmoments ] ) , or @xmath351 one can confirm this guess by computing @xmath352 for states annihilated by the constraint , that is after substituting @xmath353 for @xmath354 and symmetrizing @xmath40 and @xmath219 : @xmath355 the ordering obtained in this way is not weyl , but one can rearrange so that @xmath356 moreover , for any third - order moment of the form @xmath357 we have @xmath358 applying this for one term in our physical moment , we obtain @xmath359 which indeed agrees with the real part of ( [ complexmoments ] ) within the present approximation , in which the third - order moment @xmath360 and the re - ordering term of order @xmath361 are small compared with the second - order moments of order @xmath41 .",
    "a similar result holds for @xmath362 , which can be shown to be @xmath363 on physical states .",
    "compared with these calculations that require explicit re - orderings , deriving moments from effective constraints is much easier .      so far , in this appendix , we have not used deparameterization to distinguish one of the phase - space variables ( or an expectation value ) as time .",
    "doing so sheds more light on the complex nature of moments , as well as the time expectation value .",
    "if we choose @xmath74 as time , as in the main body of this article , expectation values and moments involving @xmath74 and @xmath75 are no longer independent of those of @xmath27 and @xmath110 .",
    "relationships for some of them are provided by effective constraints , as discussed .",
    "other moments , especially those involving @xmath74 are not even defined for physical states when deparameterization is used , just as there is no strict time fluctuation in quantum mechanics .",
    "moments involving only @xmath27 and @xmath110 , on the other hand , are physical and related to dirac observables of the effective constrained system , as shown in @xcite .",
    "moments involving @xmath75 can be obtained after solving the constraint for @xmath219 and substituting in the moments , as done in the preceding subsection and in section [ s : flucten ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ deltalambda ] ) ) .",
    "moments involving @xmath74 are not physical because they are not invariant under the gauge transformations generated by the effective constraints @xmath364 and ( [ cpl ] ) , ( [ cq ] ) , ( [ cp ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , one can see that the conditions @xmath365 are good gauge - fixing conditions for the first - order constraints @xmath255 , @xmath366 , @xmath265 and @xmath367 .",
    "( since second - order moments have a poisson structure that is not invertible , three gauge - fixing conditions suffice for four first - class constraints .",
    "see @xcite for constraints on non - symplectic spaces . )",
    "we can then immediately solve the constraint @xmath368 to obtain @xmath369 .",
    "( as a non - physical moment evaluated for physical states , this moment need not be real .",
    "the complex value ensures that the uncertainty relation is valid even with @xmath370 . )    after imposing the gauge - fixing conditions @xmath371 , only one constraint is left to the orders considered , along with a corresponding gauge flow that amounts to evolution in internal time @xmath74 .",
    "the gauge generator consistent with the gauge fixing is a linear combination @xmath372 of the four constraints which have not yet been solved ( all but @xmath255 ) so that @xmath373 for @xmath374 .",
    "computing the matrix @xmath375 and solving for the restricted components of @xmath376 , we obtain the combination @xmath377 with only one free multiplier @xmath378 .",
    "a convenient choice is @xmath379 , which gives us the @xmath74-hamiltonian @xmath380 ( we have used the constraint @xmath13 and ignored products of second - order moments . )",
    "one can easily solve some of the equations of motion to leading order , ignoring moments .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath381 so that @xmath382 is conserved .",
    "( this constant equals @xmath383 by the casimir constraint . )",
    "using @xmath384 , we can decouple the two equations , and solve for @xmath385 with this solution , we obtain @xmath386 we can then use the constraint @xmath387 to find @xmath388 the expectation value of @xmath40 ( the volume for @xmath30 ) is bounded from below by @xmath389 .",
    "( the solution for @xmath88 is exact for the harmonic ordering @xcite . )",
    "although the system is not deparameterizable by @xmath110 , effective constraints can be evaluated with local internal times valid only for a finite range . to this end",
    ", we follow the same procedure as before but choose gauge - fixing conditions @xmath390 the @xmath110-hamiltonian which preserves the new gauge - fixing conditions is now @xmath391 whose imaginary contribution comes from the complex @xmath392 ( a non - physical moment when @xmath110 is chosen as time )",
    ". the @xmath110-hamiltonian can be real only if the time expectation value @xmath393 is complex .",
    "( the expectation value @xmath394 is physical in this choice of time and must be real . ) since the imaginary contribution to @xmath395 is of the order of @xmath396 and therefore small , the imaginary contribution to @xmath397 is small and we can expand @xmath398 as well as @xmath399 with @xmath400 playing the role of an imaginary part of @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath110-hamiltonian is then real provided that @xmath401 has a vanishing imaginary part .",
    "thus , @xmath402 .",
    "we finally use this example to show that relationships between moments depend on the choice of internal time , or on the deparameterization scheme and the physical hilbert space one may construct . with the curvature parameter @xmath110 chosen as time and the gauge fixing ( [ gaugep ] ) , the general relation @xmath403 reduces to @xmath404 the complex contribution is no longer surprising .",
    "the real part of this equation implies @xmath405 for all states with the present choice of internal time , in contrast to the state - dependent and more - complicated behavior seen in the main body of this paper for @xmath74 or @xmath9 as internal time .",
    "this result serves as a reminder that the time variable and its momentum are not defined for physical states , neither as expectation values nor in moments .",
