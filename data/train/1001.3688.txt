    "the brightest galactic x - ray point sources are x - ray binaries , in which either a neutron star or a black hole accretes mass from a companion star . when the accretion flow is continuous and the x - ray luminosity remains constant within a factor of a few , a system is classified as persistent .",
    "transient x - ray binaries , on the other hand , alternate accretion outbursts that typically last for weeks to months with years to decades long episodes of quiescence , during which the x - ray luminosity is more than 2 orders of magnitude lower",
    ".    one of the phenomena that uniquely mark the compact primary as a neutron star are type - i x - ray bursts ( or shortly ` x - ray bursts ' ) ; bright flashes of x - ray emission that are caused by unstable nuclear burning on the surface of the neutron star .",
    "they are characterized by blackbody emission with a peak temperature @xmath9  kev and generally display a fast rise time followed by a slower decay phase .",
    "the initial rise can be interpreted as burning of the fuel layer , while the subsequent decay represents the cooling of the ashes .",
    "so far , x - ray bursts have only been detected from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , in which the donor star has a mass @xmath10 .",
    "the properties ( e.g. , duration , radiated energy and recurrence time ) of type - i x - ray bursts depend on the conditions of the ignition layer , such as the temperature , thickness and hydrogen ( h ) abundance . these can drastically change as the mass - accretion rate onto the neutron star varies , which results in x - ray bursts with different characteristics for different accretion regimes ( for reviews , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray bursts can be serendipitously detected by the burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard the _ swift _  satellite ; a multi - wavelength observatory that is dedicated to the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "although events from known x - ray burst sources are ignored , the bat occasionally triggers on an x - ray burst from a previously unknown burster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on 2008",
    "may 14 at 10:32:37 ut , _ swift _",
    "s bat registered an x - ray flare @xcite .",
    "the bat lightcurve and soft x - ray spectrum ( no photons detected above @xmath11 kev ) suggested that this event was not a grb @xcite .",
    "rapid follow - up observations with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) detected a bright , but quickly fading x - ray source within the 3 arcmin bat error circle @xcite .",
    "simultaneously obtained uv / optical telescope ( uvot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) images revealed a fading optical source within the xrt error circle @xcite .",
    "the uvot detection allowed for an accurate localization of the source of the bat trigger : @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( j2000 ) with a 90 per cent confidence radius of 0.56 arcsec @xcite .",
    "both the xrt and the uvot position coincide with that of the unclassified x - ray source 1rxh  j173523.7354013  ( = 1rxs  j173524.4353957=rx  j1735.33540 ; ` j1735 ' hereafter ) , which was discovered with the _ rosat _  satellite in 1990 .",
    "the bat trigger was likely the result of an x - ray burst from this system @xcite , and would thereby identify j1735  as a neutron star in , most likely , an lmxb .",
    "we note that @xcite used _",
    "swift_/xrt observations discussed in this paper to obtain a 3.5 arcsec position for the likely hard x - ray counterpart of j1735 , igr  j173533539  ( see section  [ subsec : integral ] ) . based on that position , the authors identify a bright counterpart candidate in 2mass ( _ _ ks__=@xmath14 ) and usno - b1.0 ( _ _ v__=@xmath15 ) catalogues , suggesting a possible high - mass x - ray binary nature .",
    "this object is also visible in our optical and near - infrared ( near - ir ) observations , but although it is very close to j1735  ( @xmath16  arcsec nw ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : images ] ) , it lies well outside the sub - arcsecond uvot position and is therefore not its counterpart .",
    "in this paper we report on a multi - wavelength observing campaign of j1735  following the bat trigger of 2008 may 14 .",
    "we discuss the properties of the x - ray burst and the characteristics of the persistent emission .",
    "our study comprises _ swift _",
    "data obtained with the bat , xrt and uvot , optical photometric observations carried out with the _ rapid eye mount _ ( _ rem _ ) and the _ new technology telescope _ ( _ ntt _ ) , optical spectroscopy using the _ very large telescope _",
    "( _ vlt _ ) , as well as near - ir observations performed with the _ magellan baade _ telescope .",
    "in addition , we explore archival _ rosat _ , _ integral _  and _ xmm - newton _  data to investigate the long - term flux and x - ray burst behavior of j1735 .",
    "the observations that we obtained of j1735  with different facilities are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . in the following sections these",
    "are discussed in more detail .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : burstpar ]    _ note_. the quoted fluxes are unabsorbed and for the 0.01100 kev energy range .",
