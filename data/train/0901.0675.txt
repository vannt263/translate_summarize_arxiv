    "investigation of pairing in different fermi systems is still on the forefront of active research .",
    "examples are nuclear physics @xcite and the physics of cold fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "the formation and condensation of heavier clusters in fermi systems is much less studied .    in cold atom physics the recent advent of trapping three different species of fermions",
    "@xcite has opened up the possibility of creating gases of heavier clusters . for the time",
    "being those may be trions ( bound state of three different fermions ) but in the future one also can think of quartets ( bound state of four different fermions ) .",
    "the latter are specially interesting because of their bosonic nature and the possibility of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of quartets .",
    "the description of quartet condensation to occur has been attempted with an extension of the so - called cooper problem to the four body case in @xcite . in @xcite a variational procedure for the condensation of ( @xmath0)-component fermion clusters , with @xmath1",
    "the fermion spin , has been proposed .",
    "a quartet phase has been found in a one dimensional model with four different fermions @xcite .    on the other hand , nuclear physics , because it is a four - component fermion - system ( proton / neutron spin up / down ) , all fermions attracting one another , leading to the very strongly bound @xmath2-particle , is a proto - type system for quartetting .",
    "there , the formation of clusters has been an object of study almost since the beginning of nuclear physics @xcite . of course ,",
    "pairing also exists in nuclei from where it is concluded that neutron stars are superfluid .",
    "nuclei are very small quantum objects with only a ( slowly ) fluctuating phase ( the conjugate variable to particle number @xmath3 )",
    ". actually the number of cooper pairs in nuclei generally does not exceed about a dozen ( often much less ) and yet clear signs of superfluidity are observed in nuclei ( e.g. , moments of inertia strongly reduced from their classical value ) , implying that no critical size exists from where signatures of superfluidity abruptly disappear .",
    "one , thus , can safely extrapolate from finite nuclei to superfluidity in neutron stars . on the other hand , as already mentioned , in nuclear physics the existence of quartets ( @xmath2-particles ) as subclusters of nuclei is omnipresent .",
    "as well known , many lighter nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers ( @xmath4 ) show , for instance in excited states , strong @xmath2 clustering .",
    "the concept that these @xmath2-particles may form a condensate in certain low density states of nuclei and that this may , in analogy to the pairing case , be a precursor sign of @xmath2-particle condensation in infinite matter @xcite , has come up only recently @xcite .",
    "also heavy nuclei seem to have preformed @xmath2-clusters in the surface because of their well known spontaneous @xmath2 decay properties .",
    "symmetric nuclear matter does not exist in nature because of the too strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "however , in collapsing stars , so - called proto - neutron stars , the fraction of protons is still high @xcite and the formation of @xmath2-particles and , at sufficiently low temperature , their condensation may eventually be possible . at any rate",
    ", it seems evident that nuclear matter at various degrees of asymmetry is unstable with respect to cluster formation in the low density regime . at zero temperature ,",
    "the most stable nucleus is @xmath5fe but as a function of temperature , density , asymmetry , other cluster compositions of infinite baryonic matter may be formed .",
    "several theoretical studies predict @xmath2-phases to exist in certain temperature - density- asymmetry domains @xcite .    in view of the complexity of the task ,",
    "the objective of the present work is quite modest .",
    "we want to study the critical temperature of @xmath2-particle condensation as a function of density and temperature in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "still , even this task will not be carried out down to the bec limit .",
    "we will study the critical temperature @xmath6 for the onset of formation of @xmath2-particles in a thermal gas of nucleons .",
    "this shall be done with a theory analogous to the famous thouless criterion for the onset of formation of cooper pairs in a superconductor . on the microscopic level",
    "the problem is still very challenging , since it amounts to solve an in - medium four - body problem . in spite of that",
    ", solutions have already been worked out in the past , either solving the faddeev - yakubovsky equations @xcite or with an approximate procedure @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will continue along those lines .",
    "the final objective is to reach the bec regime in a treatment similar to the one of nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory @xcite , but for quartets .",
    "needless to say that this only will be possible if the whole formalism can radically be simplified .",
    "actually , as we will show in this work , such a procedure may well exist . in any case , it is not conceivable that one treats condensation of bosonic clusters built out of @xmath3 fermions on the level of non - linear in medium @xmath3-body equations for @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known , that nuclei can satisfactorily be described , in mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "projecting these mean field ( hartree - fock ) type of solutions on zero total momentum ( @xmath8 ) will then allow these mean field clusters to bose condense .",
    "actually it is well known among the nuclear physics community that even for such a small nucleus as the @xmath2-particle a momentum projected mean field approach yields a very reasonable description @xcite .",
    "the reason for this stems , as already mentioned , from the presence of four different fermions , all attracting one another with about the same force .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we sketch the situation , indicating that the two protons and two neutrons occupy the lowest @xmath9 level of the mean field potential .",
    "actually calculations show that the @xmath9 orbital of the self - consistent mean field resembles very much an oscillator wave function of gaussian shape . in this respect the cartoon in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is not so far from reality .",
    "we suspect that the situation is generic for all strongly bound quartets which may be produced in the future and , therefore , our present study is of quite general interest .",
    "we will adopt this momentum projected mean field procedure in this work .",
    "sketch of @xmath2-particle configuration , indicating that the two protons and two neutrons occupy the lowest @xmath9 level in the mean field potential of harmonic oscillator shape.,width=151 ]",
    "in - medium four body equations are well documented in the literature since long @xcite . in the present case of an in - medium quartet ,",
    "the corresponding equation reads as follows @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11^{-1}$ ] with @xmath12 is the fermi - dirac distribution and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 : natural units ) .",
    "the matrix element of the interaction is @xmath15 with the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , @xmath16 standing for all quantum numbers as momenta , spin , isospin , etc .",
    ", as also in all other quantities in ( [ eq1 ] ) .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , when @xmath17 , this signals quartet condensation in very much the same manner as in the two body equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the approach of @xmath20 such that @xmath21 signals the transition to a superconducting or superfluid state ( the well known thouless criterion @xcite ) .",
    "of course , as already stated several times , the determination of @xmath6 needs the heavy solution of the in - medium modified four particle equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .    following the discussion in the introduction , we , therefore , make the following projected mean field ansatz for the quartet wave function @xcite , @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the spin - isospin function which we suppose to be the one of a scalar ( @xmath24 ) . we will not further mention it from now on .",
    "we work in momentum space and @xmath25 is the as - yet unknown single particle @xmath9 wave function . in position space , this leads to the usual formula @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fourier transform of @xmath28 .",
    "if we take for @xmath28 gaussian shape , this gives : @xmath29 $ ] which is the translationally invariant ansatz often used to describe @xmath2-clusters in nuclei .",
    "for instance , it is also employed in the @xmath2-particle condensate wave function of tohsaki , horiuchi , schuck , rpke ( thsr ) in @xcite .    inserting the ansatz ( [ eq3 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] ) and integrating over superfluous variables , or minimizing the energy , we arrive at the following non - linear , hartree - fock type of equation for the single particle @xmath9 wave function @xmath30    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are given by : @xmath35 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times &    ( 2\\pi)^3\\delta^{(3)}(\\sum_{i=1}^4{\\bf k}_i )   \\label{eq4c}\\\\ % % % { \\cal b}(k_1)&=&\\int \\prod^{4}_{i=2}\\frac{d^3 k_i}{(2\\pi)^3 } \\frac{d^3k_1'}{(2\\pi)^3}\\frac{d^3k_2'}{(2\\pi)^3 } ( 1-f(\\varepsilon_1)-f(\\varepsilon_2 ) ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & v_{{\\bf k}_1 { \\bf k}_2,{\\bf k}_1 ' { \\bf k}_2 ' } \\varphi(k_1')\\varphi(k_2')\\varphi(k_2)|\\varphi(k_3)|^2|\\varphi(k_4)|^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & ( 2\\pi)^3\\delta^{(3)}(\\sum_{i=1}^4{\\bf k}_i ) \\label{eq4a}\\\\ % % % { \\cal c}(k_1 ) & = & \\int \\prod^{4}_{i=2}\\frac{d^3 k_i}{(2\\pi)^3 }   \\frac{d^3k_2'}{(2\\pi)^3}\\frac{d^3k_3'}{(2\\pi)^3 } ( 1-f(\\varepsilon_2)-f(\\varepsilon_3 ) ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times&v_{{\\bf k}_2 { \\bf k}_3 , { \\bf k}_2 ' { \\bf k}_3 ' }   \\varphi(k_2)\\varphi(k_2')\\varphi(k_3)\\varphi(k_3')|\\varphi(k_4)|^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & ( 2\\pi)^3\\delta^{(3)}(\\sum_{i=1}^4{\\bf k}_i ) , \\label{eq4b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , in this pilot study , we neglect mean field shifts and effective mass contributions .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , we obtain the single particle wave function in momentum space as @xmath36 as seen in eqs .",
    "( [ eq4c ] ) , ( [ eq4a ] ) , and ( [ eq4b ] ) , since @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 depend on the wave function of @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) is strongly non - linear .",
    "its solution can be found by iteration .    for a general two body force @xmath38 ,",
    "the equation to be solved is still rather complicated .",
    "we , therefore , proceed to the last simplification and replace the two body force by a unique separable one , that is @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) are determined so that binding energy ( @xmath57 mev ) and radius ( @xmath58 fm ) of the free ( @xmath59 ) @xmath2-particle come out right .",

    "these results for @xmath6 are by about 25 percent higher than the ones of our earlier publication @xcite .",
    "we , however , checked that the underlying radius of the @xmath2-particle in that work is larger than the experimental value and that @xmath6 decreases with increasing radius of @xmath2-particle . furthermore a different variational wave function was used in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we also show the critical temperature for deuteron condensation derived from eq .",

    "the latter breaks down rather abruptly at a critical positive value of the chemical potential . roughly speaking",

    "this behavior stems from the fact that fermi - dirac distributions in the four body case , see ( [ eq1 ] ) , can never become step - like , as in the two body case , even not at zero temperature , since the pairs in an @xmath2-particle are always in motion . as a consequence ,",

    "in this work we again took up the study of the critical temperature of @xmath2-particle ( quartet ) condensation in homogeneous symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we essentially confirm the behavior of two previous studies @xcite .",
    "the objective of the paper was to show that practically same results as before can be obtained with a strongly simplifying ansatz for the four particle wave function .",
    "namely , this time , we used a momentum projected mean field variational wave function .",
    "this is based on the fact that the four different fermions of the quartet can occupy the same single particle @xmath9-wave function in the mean field .",
    "the latter is to be determined from a self - consistent non linear hf - type of equation as a function of chemical potential or density .",
    "the relation between the chemical potential and density is taken from the free fermi gas relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq - density ] ) .",
    "however , the total nucleon density of the system must be calculated from the mean single nucleon state occupation number taking into account correlations , so that the contribution of bound states to the total nucleon density is taken into account , see ref .",
    "@xcite . to calculate the critical temperature not as function of the free nucleon density , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , but of the total nucleon density , a generalization  la nsr @xcite must be performed , that is we have at least to incorporate the contribution of the @xmath2-particle density including the condensate to the single particle occupation numbers .",
    "this shall be investigated in future work .    besides , in this work , we used the isospin - independent separable potential , eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) , for the two - body interaction as a simplification .",
    "comparison with a realistic two - body interaction is interesting .",
    "this study also shall be done in the future .",
    "the self - consistent wave function has been studied in momentum and position space . for negative chemical potential",
    "the single particle wave function behaves like a gaussian .",
    "however , once the chemical potential turns positive , then the single particle wave function in @xmath90-space starts to oscillate .",
    "this is a well known feature from ordinary pairing .",
    "we , therefore , have demonstrated that a very simplifying momentum projected mean field ansatz suffices to account for the salient features of quartet condensation .",
    "this is very helpful for the next step which is more complicated , i.e. the incorporation of quartet condensation self - consistently into the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we should , however , be aware of the fact that our projected mean field ansatz for the quartet wave function can only be a valid approximation so long as well defined quartets exist . in the break down region",
    "seen on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , this is certainly no longer the case .",
    "how the quartet phase evolves into a superfluid phase of pairs is an open question . a possibility to study",
    "this very interesting problem could be to write down the in - medium four body equation ( [ eq1 ] ) directly in the bcs formalism , i.e. with the corresponding bcs coherence factors .",
    "it may be foreseen that the latter only catch on close to the transition region .",
    "another interesting problem for the future is how the present results are modified in the asymmetric case , that is in the case of neutron excess .    the success of our study to employ a very simplifying ansatz of the mean field type for the quartet wave function ,",
    "may open wide perspectives . besides to push the description of quartet condensation",
    "much further , there might exist the possibility that even for the case of a gas of trions such a projected mean field ansatz is a quite valid approach . in the case of three colors , like quarks in the constituent quark model for nucleons ,",
    "a harmonic confining potential is frequently assumed and the three quarks can occupy the lowest @xmath9 state , analogously to the case of quartets treated in the present paper . of course , trions are composite fermions and can not be treated in the same way as bosonic composites , since they shall form a new fermi gas with their own new fermi level .",
    "how this situation can eventually be treated has recently been outlined in @xcite .",
