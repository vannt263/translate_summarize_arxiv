    "spin - orbit ( so ) interaction is one of the most striking relativistic effects that can be observed in solid state systems .",
    "the seminal proposal of a spin - polarized field effect transistor by datta and das@xcite , and the range of possible applications in spintronics@xcite led to a remarkable progress in controlling@xcite and measuring@xcite not only the overall spin - orbit coupling constant@xcite but also the dresselhaus and rashba ratio@xcite .",
    "recently an increasing interest has been devoted to studying the interplay between spin - orbit ( so ) coupling and superconductivity .",
    "in particular many studies@xcite have widely analyzed the influence of so interaction on the equilibrium supercurrent ( dc josephson effect ) , pointing out that the multi - level nature of the dot is a crucial ingredient .",
    "indeed so coupling induces , in the presence of many levels , inter - band spin - flip processes which can affect the josephson current in a non trivial way .",
    "on the other hand , also _ non - equilibrium _ transport properties of nanodevices contacted to two superconducting electrodes have been a subject of intensive research since many years , from both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite sides . in particular ,",
    "semiconductor - superconductor hybrid systems are currently under spotlight , because techniques have been developed to realize highly transparent semi / super interfaces@xcite , by suppressing schottky barriers and enhancing the measured signal . in many cases",
    "such devices are based on in - as - related materials@xcite , which are known to exhibit rashba and dresselhaus so interaction .",
    "nevertheless , a systematic analysis of the interplay between finite bias superconducting transport and spin precession induced by so is lacking .",
    "the aim of the present work is to bridge this gap , investigating the effects of so on electron transport through a quantum dot ( qd ) connected to two superconducting leads , biased by a voltage @xmath4 , as sketched in fig.[setup ] .",
    "+ it is well known that the subgap i - v curve of transport through a quantum dot is characterized by andreev peaks , originating from the resonance of the dot level with a multiple andreev reflection ( mar ) trajectory , i.e. a sequence of odd andreev reflections occurring at the interfaces with the leads@xcite . in each andreev",
    "reflection the incoming and outgoing electron - hole pairs have opposite spins@xcite . in the presence of spin - orbit , however , the dot levels lack of a definite spin orientation .",
    "the question thus arises whether the resonances with dot levels and andreev processes persist , or whether spin - orbit coupling suppresses the mar peaks .",
    "another interesting issue is the role of the shape of the dot confining potential ; its anisotropies indeed affect not only the number of effective levels involved in transport , but also the relative weight of rashba and dresselhaus components .",
    "the scenario is expected to be even richer in the presence of an in - plane magnetic field , since the latter introduces a preferred spin direction competing with the spin - orbit precession .",
    "+ here we analyze how the subgap mar pattern is affected by these phenomena .",
    "our approach is based on the keldysh technique , which allows us to account for non - equilibrium regime induced by the finite voltage . in order to single out the effects of spin - orbit interaction , we neglect coulomb interaction in the dot , so that tunneling between the leads and the dot can be treated exactly .",
    "our results thus apply to the regime of relatively high dot - lead transparency ( the linewidths are assumed to be some fraction of the superconducting gap ) , so that spurious effects due to charging are avoided .",
    "we also consider different shapes for the dot confinement potential , and analyze the role of anisotropy .",
    "+ the structure of the paper is the following . in sec.[secii ]",
    "we describe the model .",
    "the expression for the current is presented and briefly outlined in sec.[seciii ] .",

    "we consider different types of shapes for the confining potential @xmath92 , from isotropic ( @xmath93 ) to strongly anisotropic ( @xmath94 ) , as shown in fig.[parabolas ] .",
    "experimentally , a tuning of the frequencies @xmath11 ( see eq .",
    "( [ vpar ] ) ) can be achieved through side gates , which do not substantially alter rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling . for the sake of clarity",
    ", it is worth pointing out that throughout the paper we use the term isotropy as referring to the confining potential @xmath92 only , and not to the full dot hamiltonian .",
    "it is indeed easily checked that , even for a isotropic potential @xmath92 and in absence of in - plane magnetic field , the hamiltonian of the dot is _ not _ invariant under rotation around @xmath14-axis , because the dresselhaus term in eq .",
    "( [ vso ] ) does not commute with the total angular momentum @xmath95 .",
    "+ we start by some general remarks . in the first instance",
    ", simple perturbation theory arguments lead to conclude that spin - orbit effects can only be observed in a multilevel quantum dot : for one single level quantum dot , spin - orbit interaction does not play any role , because the momentum operator appearing in eq .",
    "( [ vso ] ) can only couple dot levels with different quantum numbers @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( see eq .",
    "( [ spectrum0]))@xcite . for these reasons , in the following we shall consider only multilevel quantum dots .",
    "the number @xmath33 of states contributing to transport depends on the parameters of @xmath98 , and is chosen in such a way that the subgap i - v curve remains unaffected by inclusion of higher energy levels .",
    "notice that for intermediate level spacing ( i.e. for @xmath99 ) the dot excited levels are energetically too high to contribute to transport directly , but close enough to the unperturbed ground state to modify its resonance conditions via spin - orbit interaction , hence affecting transport indirectly . in this sense",
    "the effect of spin orbit can be considered as due to a single level .",
    "+ secondly , the shape of the confining potential has a crucial role in determining spin - orbit effects : it is easy to verify that entries of the dot hamiltonian ( [ ham - d ] ) originating from spin - orbit couplings ( [ vso ] ) scale as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 are the lengths associated with the frequencies of the confining potential @xmath92 . indeed",
    "the value of @xmath102 determines the number of states in the @xmath19 and @xmath103 direction that contribute to transport , and also changes the relative weight of spin - orbit terms proportional to @xmath104 with respect to those involving @xmath105 .",
    "+ finally , since we account for both rashba and dresselhaus terms , it is worth introducing a total dresselhaus / rashba coupling constant@xcite @xmath106 and a relative dresselhaus / rashba spin - orbit angle @xmath3 , defined through the relations @xmath107 with the help of eqs.([alpha ] ) and ( [ thetaso ] ) , the spin - orbit coupling ( [ vso ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the @xmath12 plane momentum and @xmath110 is a vector with components @xmath111 eq .  ( [ vso-2 ] ) describes the well known effect that , in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , the spin orientation depends on the momentum @xmath112 direction , in a manner which is also related rashba / dresselhaus angle @xmath3 . for the case of a two - dimensional electron gas ,",
    "this aspect was recently emphasized e.g. in ref .. in a quantum dot , however , states with well defined momentum are not eigenstates , due to the presence of the confining potential  @xmath92 .",
    "hence , in the presence of spin - orbit coupling the dot levels do not exhibit a definite spin orientation in general , and the question arises whether mar resonances are suppressed by spin - orbit . + in the rest of the paper we present our results addressing the following questions : i ) does spin - orbit interaction in a quantum dot suppress mar peaks ?",
    "( see fig.[fig - mar ] ) ii ) does the geometry of the dot matter in observing spin - orbit effect on electron transport ; iii ) what is the effect of the interplay between the spin - orbit angle @xmath3 and the magnetic field on the i - v curves ?",
    "+      we start our analysis from the case of an isotropic confining potential ( @xmath113 ) , without magnetic field .",
    "the solid curve of fig.[figura - sym-1 ] shows the i - v characteristics for a dot with @xmath114 and confining potential frequencies @xmath115 , so that only the ground state lies in the gap energy window .",
    "the solid curve is obtained in the presence of spin - orbit coupling @xmath116 and rashba / dresselhaus angle @xmath117 . for the sake of comparison",
    "we have also plotted the case of vanishing spin - orbit ( dashed curve ) .",
    "our result indicates that spin - orbit coupling modifies , rather than suppress , the mar pattern .",
    "this is due to the fact that , although spin - orbit coupling does not allow electrons in the dot to have a definite spin orientation , it does not break time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) . as a consequence of trs",
    ", the dot levels are always doubly degenerate and the related pair of eigenstates mutually connected by the time - reversal transformation @xmath118 where @xmath119 is complex conjugation .",
    "an electron emerging from an andreev reflection at the interface can thus tunnel into the doubly degenerate dot level , independent of its original spin - direction , even in the presence of a finite spin orbit coupling @xmath120 .",
    "with respect to the case @xmath121 , the electron simply redistributes differently between the two trs dot states .",
    "although spin - orbit effect does not destroy the mar subgap pattern , it does modify it , because the location of mar peaks and their sharpness depend on the dot resonant levels and the dot - lead linewidths , which are both affected by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the simple case of an isotropic quantum dot with 3 levels ( one @xmath122 and two orbitally degenerate @xmath46 levels ) can elucidate this effect , since the spectrum can be evaluated analytically , obtaining @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the dimensionless spin - orbit coupling .",
    "+ in conclusion , the mar pattern is quantitatively modified by spin orbit coupling @xmath120 , although it qualitatively resembles the one of a dot with appropriately renormalized levels and linewidths .",
    "+ let us now discuss the effects of the spin - orbit angle  @xmath3 . in fig.[figura - sym-2 ] the current - voltage characteristics",
    "is shown for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "one can notice that for an equal weight of rashba and dresselhaus terms ( @xmath117 ) the mar peaks are enhanced with respect to the two cases of purely rashba ( @xmath125 ) and purely dresselhaus ( @xmath126 ) interactions .",
    "indeed for the particular value @xmath117 electrons in the dot have a well defined spin orientation , since the hamiltonian ( [ ham - d ] ) commutes with the spin operator @xmath127 .",
    "in contrast , for arbitrary values of @xmath3 spin is not a good quantum number .",
    "the curves at @xmath125 and @xmath126 turn out to coincide , since the hamiltonian corresponding to these two cases can be mapped into each other by the unitary transformation on the spin variables @xmath128      the equivalence discussed above between transport properties of a dot with purely rashba and purely dresselhaus terms persists also in the presence of anisotropy in the confining potential @xmath92 of the dot . however , when the anisotropy of the dot increases , the dependence of the i - v curves on the angle @xmath3 becomes weaker ( see fig.[figura - asym-1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , for a dot with a strongly anisotropic confining potential ( e.g. for @xmath129 ) , and in absence of magnetic field , electron transport becomes insensitive to the spin - orbit angle @xmath3 , and only the total intensity @xmath120 of spin - orbit coupling matters .    in order to understand this effect one can observe that , due to the anisotropy of the confining potential , only the lowest quantum number related to the @xmath103 effectively matters . thus the operator  @xmath105 appearing in the spin - orbit interaction in eq .",
    "( [ vso ] ) does not alter the dot levels involved in transport , and can effectively be dropped from the hamiltonian .",
    "importantly , this implies that for a strongly anisotropic quantum dot the spin - orbit interaction does not induce any spin - precession , but rather determines one preferred orientation of the electron spin in the @xmath12-plane .",
    "although such spin direction formally depends on the spin - orbit angle @xmath3 , the latter can indeed be gauged away completely from the hamiltonian by performing a unitary transformation only on the spin degrees of freedom @xmath130 \\label{v - theta}\\ ] ] yielding a spin - orbit coupling @xmath131 + which involves only the @xmath19-component of spin . in absence of magnetic field all directions are thus equivalent for electron transport , and this explains the lack of dependence on @xmath3 of the i - v curves .      in this section",
    "we discuss the effect of the in - plane magnetic field , analyzing both the dependence on its intensity  @xmath17 and on the angle @xmath18 .",
    "fig.[figura - b-1 ] shows the subgap structure for different values of the dimensionless magnetic field @xmath132 in an isotropic 3-level quantum dot .",
    "as one can see , mar peaks are suppressed by increasing  @xmath133 , as expected since magnetic field breaks time reversal symmetry and suppresses the probability that an electron emerging from an andreev reflection matches resonance conditions with the appropriate spin direction . +    a more interesting scenario emerges when analyzing the dependence of the subgap structure on the magnetic field angle @xmath18 . to this purpose",
    ", it is worth discussing how the spectrum of the dot varies with @xmath18 while keeping the intensity @xmath17 constant .",
    "the shape of the confining potential turns out to play a crucial role on it .",
    "we start with the case of an isotropic quantum dot with three orbital levels ( one non - degenerate @xmath122 level and one doubly degenerate @xmath46 level ) .",
    "fig.[figura - eigval]a shows ( some of ) the levels of a dot with level spacing @xmath134 , in the presence of a spin - orbit coupling @xmath135 ( see eq .",

    "( [ b - def ] ) ) . as",
    "one can see , the eigenvalues oscillate as a function of @xmath18 and exhibit maxima and minima located at @xmath137 and @xmath138 . notice that in this case the spin - orbit angle  @xmath3 only affects the amplitude of the oscillations and not the location of the minima and maxima as a function of  @xmath18 .",
    "the origin of this effect boils down to the symmetry of the hamitonian .",
    "indeed for an isotropic dot the hamiltonian characterized by a magnetic field with an angle @xmath139 can be mapped into the one with an angle @xmath140 through the unitary transformation @xmath141 and it therefore exhibits the same spectrum as the latter . for an isotropic dot , as far as the dependence of i - v curves on the in - plane magnetic field is concerned , the role of @xmath3 is not qualitatively different from the one of spin - orbit strength @xmath120 , and it is thus difficult to extract information about spin - orbit angle by the analysis of the mar pattern as a function of @xmath18 . +    the situation is quite different for a strongly anisotropic confining potential @xmath92 .",
    "the dependence of ( some ) dot levels is shown in fig.[figura - eigval]b for a 3-level dot with spin orbit coupling @xmath135 and magnetic field intensity @xmath136 .",

    ", we recall that when the anisotropy of the dot confining potential is strong , the electron exhibits a well defined spin orientation which depends on @xmath3 ; the introduction of a magnetic field simply induces a spin precession around its direction@xcite . more formally , the transformation  ( [ v - theta ] ) yields an effectively rotated magnetic field @xmath144 whose direction depends on the spin - orbit angle @xmath3 . the structure of eq .",
