    "spatial distribution of surface functionality ,  surface heterogeneity \" , on these naturally - occurring and technologically relevant particles is consistently neglected , at length scales that vary from a few nanometers to the particle radius @xcite .",
    "patterned colloids such as janus particles @xcite and colloidal molecules @xcite have attracted intense interest for their potential to assemble into ordered periodic structures , not only for photonic applications @xcite , but also , more fundamentally , to mimic the phase transitions of molecules @xcite .",
    "the ability of engineered chemical and topographical patterns on these particles to direct their interactions suggest @xcite that the randomly distributed heterogeneities on naturally - occurring particles will influence their adhesion as well , even though the length scales of such particle features fall well below the colloidal dimensions @xcite .",
    "the literature of the past two decades contain numerous efforts that model the adhesion of flowing particles on surfaces regularly - patterned with features that approach the lengthscales of the flowing particles @xcite .",
    "the adhesion of flowing micron - sized particles on nano - scale heterogeneous collectors , however , has only been examined recently @xcite .",
    "surface heterogeneity , defined as a random arrangement of surface features , was shown to influence particle adhesion significantly , and it was demonstrated , for instance , that randomly - positioned clusters of nanoscale cationic patches on the collector can drive colloidal particle deposition onto net negative collecting surfaces @xcite . even when each nanoscale cluster or  patch \" of positive charge , positioned on the negative background surface , is individually too weakly attractive towards uniform flowing anionic particles , the concerted action of many of such patches can capture particles .",
    "modeling methods that describe particle - collector interactions have evolved considerably over the past decade , from analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite computations of systems characterized by surface roughness , to the development of the surface - element integration ( sei ) @xcite and the more recent grid - surface integration ( gsi ) @xcite techniques . while the sei technique involves the discretization of only one interacting surface , in the now - accepted @xcite gsi technique surface forces are integrated over differential elements on two opposing objects of arbitrary shapes .",
    "in many recent computational studies , patchy particles are modeled as units composed of distinct `` atoms . ''",
    "specific attributes are assigned to each atom , depending on whether it belongs to the ` patch ' or ` core ' surface area of the particle .",
    "zhang and glotzer@xcite performed brownian dynamic simulations to model the self assembly of particles patterned with patches positioned at specific locations .",
    "polyelectrolytes of varying shapes are also shown by molecular dynamic computations to assemble into charged , patchy colloids @xcite .    while theoretical work on patchy particle interactions at the molecular scale abound , only a handful of studies describe colloidal interactions of heterogeneous particles flowing near a planar wall and the effects of such heterogeneities on particle deposition .",
    "in contrast to the studies on heterogeneous fixed collectors , the system geometry comprising heterogeneous particles presents the additional complexity that , in shear flow , the particle rotates , exposing different areal elements to the collecting surface as it flows past .",
    "this rotation and turnover in the dominant surface region poses a computational challenge in the calculation of time - dependent colloidal interactions . only a limited number of studies",
    "have addressed computationally related problems : sphere - plate and sphere - sphere dlvo interactions for spheres patterned with roughness ( topographical heterogeneity ) were computed numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite and found to agree with experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "more recently , chatterjee et al . focused on the deposition of micro - particles onto janus and patchy spherical collectors @xcite .",
    "chemical heterogeneity was modeled by patterning the spherical collector with adhesion - favorable and adhesion - unfavorable surface properties assigned to the janus collectors or with relatively wide alternating stripes ( much wider than the particle radius ) that covered the spherical surface .",
    "deposition of the colloidal particles onto spherical heterogeneous collectors was analyzed as a function of collector orientation , collector patterning , and colloidal particle velocity .",
    "similarly , the adhesion of leukocytes on the vascular endothelium was studied computationally by korn and schwarz @xcite , who modeled flowing leukocytes that were captured by the binding of randomly - positioned immobilized receptors .",
    "the adhesive receptors on the leukocytes , modeled as hard spheres , were similar to the randomly distributed nano - patches on flowing micro - particles .",
    "the leukocyte capture , however , is fundamentally different from the heterogeneous particle adhesion , since the receptors underwent chemical binding according to a reaction probability when in close distance to a surface ligand .",
    "interesting motions of leukocytes , that ranged from free flow to firm adhesion , were presented as a function of the attachment and detachment rates of the cells to the wall in adhesion regime diagrams .",
    "the treatment lacked the spatially varying longer range colloidal forces of interest in the current study , but was , nonetheless , a break - through in its attention to patterned particle rotation in flow .",
    "as a result of this advance , the computations predicted interesting motion signatures such as particle rolling and skipping .",
    "the present work describes a new computational approach to calculate particle - surface interactions , trajectories and adhesion probabilities of flowing heterogeneous particles on fixed planar uniform collectors .",
    "the method expands the implementations of the grid - surface integration ( gsi ) technique by discretizing the particle surface , in order to include on its surface a random distribution of patches .",
    "dlvo ( electrostatic and van der waals ) interactions are computed within the gsi technique on the basis of parallel flat plate expressions @xcite , and flow - driven motion is obtained from the mobility matrix of the hydrodynamics problem @xcite .",
    "two heterogeneous particle - collector system geometries are , moreover , compared in detail . while one of such systems comprises electrostatically heterogeneous particles flowing past a uniform anionic collector , the alternative system consists of uniform anionic particles flowing past an electrostatically heterogeneous collector , such that surface compositions in each system are reversed .",
    "the two configurations differ in their number of particle trajectory fluctuations and their collection probability due to the particles rotational motion , given by the rotational velocity times the particle radius , that is slower than its translational motion , determined by the translational velocity .",
