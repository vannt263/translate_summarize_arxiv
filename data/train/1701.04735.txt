    ", a poverty line is set as the lowest income under which an individual is declared poor .",
    "the number of poor individuals in the sample is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "now , we consider for each @xmath13 , the takayama statistic as defined by    @xmath14    we will see in theorem [ theo1 ] that , under suitable conditions , takayama s index ( [ takayamaemp ] ) converges in probability to    @xmath15    as @xmath16 .",
    "accordingly , the number @xmath17 is defined as the takayama parameter of the _ cdf _ @xmath8 .",
    "+ this statistic has been extensively studied by many authors from the axiomatic point of view .",
    "indeed , welfare analysis researchers investigate the quality of an index with respect to a number of desired axioms . in that sense , the review paper of @xcite is a useful reference .",
    "we are going to quote @xcite , just to highlight its importance and , for this reason , we will not enter into the details of the meanings of these axioms . according to @xcite ,",
    "takayama s measure satisfies the following axioms : focus , symmetry , replication invariance , continuity , minimal transfer , restricted continuity , nonpoverty growth , normalization . and",
    "it fails to fulfill the others : weak transfer , progressive transfer , decomposability , regressive transfer , weak transfer sensitivity , subgroup consistency , weak monotonicity , strong monotonicity .",
    "+ with respect to its relation with the gini inequality , the takayama measure is a smoother translation of the gini coefficient ; but such advantage is obtained at a substantial cost .",
    "( see @xcite ) . as takayama",
    "himself admitted , his measure may violate the monotonicity axioms , which is a serious drawback .",
    "it violates every axiom that the sen measure fails to satisfy except continuity and replication invariance .",
    "the claim by takayama that his estimator is superior to that of sen has been challenged .. \" .",
    "+ one of the most desired axiom of a welfare measure is the decomposability one .",
    "let us explain this property at a statistical level .",
    "+ suppose that we are monitoring some index @xmath18 over a given population of size @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath18 is applied to the whole population , we may use the notation @xmath20 . in a large population subjected to a number of inequalities between areas and in which there are groups with specific features at the exclusion of the others",
    ", public policy efficiency usually requires to target disadvantaged areas or groups and to implement therein strong strategies aimed at improving the status of this group in relation to a given pattern ( for example poverty , health covering , education level , etc . ) , monitored by the index @xmath18 .",
    "in such a case , the population is divided into sensitive @xmath21 subgroups of interest @xmath22 of respective sizes @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the studied behavior is followed up by an index , say @xmath18 , taking the values @xmath25 in each subgroup @xmath26 , @xmath24 .",
    "+ the index @xmath18 is said to be decomposable if we may express the _ global _ index on the whole population with respect to the partial indices at the subgroup level as follows , that is    @xmath27    formula ( [ formule.decom ] ) offers the practical and comfortable latitude to work at the local level with the possibility to recompose the global index at the global level .",
    "this explains why decomposable indices are so preferred , in particular the foster - greer - thorbecke ( @xcite ) index of index @xmath28    @xmath29    the problem is that some the most interesting measures are not decomposable , in particular the weighted ones . indeed",
    ", successful policies require to target disadvantaged or vulnerable groups .",
    "for example , suppose that we are dealing with poverty .",
    "a measure that counts all poor individuals with the same weight is less interesting than another that puts bigger weights to poorer individuals .",
    "a variation of such an index in the good direction tends to be negligible if the less poor individual behave better , and to be noticeable if the poorer individuals among the poor become better off .",
    "+ our problematic is to keep using weighted measures like sen @xcite , kakwani @xcite , shorrocks @xcite and takayama measures , to cite a few , and yet , to have a quick approach to report the global situation .",
    "the solution resides certainly in the estimation of the decomposability gap .",
    "@xmath30    we will see later that we will be able to estimate this gap",
    ". then we will be able to work at a local level and to report the global index in accurate confidence interval .",
    "+ recently , haidara and lo @xcite motivated the estimation of decomposability gap of non - decomposable measures in the sense described above .",
    "but the results in @xcite , although including almost all the known measures , ignored the takayama for the main reason that this latter is not based on the poverty deficits @xmath31 nor on the relative poverty deficits @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath12 is the number of poor individuals , numbered from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the poverty line .",
    "+ this is the main motivation of studying the takayama s index with respect to two directions : + ( a ) provide a full asymptotic theory of takayama s index , in parallel with that of general poverty index ( gpi ) in which its fails to a part of it .",
    "this asymptotic theory is based on the use of the functional empirical process and provides the results in the form of asymptotic representations .",
    "+ ( b ) based on the results of point ( a ) , the same functional empirical process is used again to handle the decomposability gap .",
    "+ our best achievements are the complete description of the asymptotic distribution of the generalized takayama measure using the functional empirical process and an auxiliary empirical process we name _ residual one _ in @xcite , and the statistical estimation of decomposability gap .",
    "+ the rest of paper is organized as follows . in the rest of this section [ sec1 ] , we describe the probability space on which the proofs will take place . in section [ sec2 ] , an asymptotic representation theorem for the generalized takayama index is stated and proved . in section [ sec3 ]",
