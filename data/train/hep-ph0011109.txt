    "this talk is mainly based on earlier papers  @xcite on the light scalars and on a more recent one @xcite on the  in charm decay , including a few new comments .",
    "first we shall discuss the evidence for the light  and explain how one can understand the controversial light scalar mesons with a unitarized quark model , which includes most well established theoretical constraints :    * adler zeroes as required by chiral symmetry , * all light two - pseudoscalar ( pp ) thresholds with flavor symmetric couplings in a coupled channel framework * physically acceptable analyticity , and * unitarity .",
    "a unique feature of this model is that it simultaneously describes the whole scalar nonet and one obtains a good representation of a large set of relevant data .",
    "only six parameters , which all have a clear physical interpretation , are needed .    after describing our understanding of the @xmath2 nonet",
    ", we discuss the recently measured @xmath11 decay , where the  is clearly seen as the dominant peak .",
    "the interpretation of the nature of lightest scalar mesons has been controversial for long .",
    "there is no general agreement on where are the @xmath2 states , is there a glueball among the light scalars , are some of the scalars multiquark or @xmath12 bound states ? as for the @xmath1 , authors do not even agree on its existence as a fundamental hadron , although the number of supporters is growing rapidly .    in fig .",
    "1 we have plotted with filled circles the results of 22 different analyses on the  pole position , which are included in the 2000 edition of the review of particle physics @xcite under the entry @xmath13 or . most of these find a  pole position near 500-i250 mev .    also , at a recent meeting @xcite devoted to the @xmath1 , many groups reported preliminary analyzes , which find the resonance parameters in the same region .",
    "these are plotted as triangles in fig .",
    "it was not possible to here distinguish between breit - wigner parameters and pole positions , which of course can differ by several 100 mev for the same data .",
    "it must also be noted that many of the triangles in fig .",
    "1 rely on the same raw data and come from preliminary analyzes not yet published .",
    "we also included in fig .",
    "1 ( with a star ) the  parameters obtained from the recent e791 experiment at fermilab @xcite , where 46% of the @xmath14 dalitz plot is @xmath15 . the open circle in the same figure represents the  parameters extracted from the cleo analysis of @xmath16 @xcite .     or",
    "( filled circles ) , plotted in the complex energy plane ( in units of mev ) .",
    "the triangles represent the mass and width parameters ( plotted as @xmath17 ) , which were reported at this meeting .",
    "we could not here distinguish between pole and breit - wigner parameters .",
    "the star is the @xmath17 point obtained from the recent e791 experiment @xcite on @xmath18 ( @xmath19 mev , @xmath20 mev ) while the open circle is that obtained by the cleo analysis of @xmath21 @xcite.,width=491 ]",
    "the njl model is an effective theory which is believed to be related to qcd at low energies , when one has integrated out the gluon fields .",
    "it involves a linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "after bosonization of the njl model one finds essentially the linear sigma model ( ) as an approximate effective theory for the scalar and pseudoscalar meson sector .",
    "about 30 years ago schechter and ueda @xcite wrote down the @xmath22  for the meson sector involving a scalar and a pseudoscalar nonet .",
    "this ( renormalizable ) theory has only 6 parameters , out of which 5 can be fixed by the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the sixth parameter for the ozi rule violating 4-point coupling must be small .",
    "one can then predict , with no free parameters , the tree level scalar masses @xcite , which turn out to be not far from the lightest experimental masses , although the two quantities are exactly the same thing but can differ for the same model and data by over 100 mev .",
    "the important thing is that the scalar masses are predicted to be near the lightest experimentally seen scalar masses , and not in the 1500 mev region where many authors want to put the lightest @xmath2 scalars . the  is predicted @xcite at 620 mev with a very large width ( @xmath24 mev ) , which well agrees with fig .",
    "the @xmath25 is predicted at 1128 mev , the @xmath4 at 1190 mev , and the @xmath26 at 1120 mev , which is surprisingly good considering that loop effects are large .",
    "in figs .  2 - 4 we show the obtained fits to the @xmath27 , @xmath28 s - waves and to the  resonance peak in @xmath29 .",
    "the partial wave amplitude ( pwa ) in the case of one  resonance , such as the @xmath25 , can be written as : @xmath30},\\ ] ] where : [ pwa ] im(s)&=&_i im_i(s ) [ impi ] = -_i _ i^2(s - s_a , i)e^-k_i^2/k_0 ^ 2 ( s - s_th , i )  , + re(s)&=&1^_s_th,1 ds  . here the coupling constants @xmath31 are related by flavour symmetry and ozi rule , such that there is only one over all parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 are the positions of the adler zeroes , which are near @xmath34 .",
    "( 1 ) can be looked upon as a more general breit - wigner form , where the mass parameter is replaced by an @xmath35-dependent function ,  the running mass \" @xmath36 .    in the flavourless channels the situation is a little more complicated than in eq .",
    "( 1 ) since one has both  and states , requiring a two dimensional mass matrix ( see ref .",
    "note that the sum runs over all light pp thresholds , which means three for the : @xmath37 and three for the : @xmath38 , while for the @xmath39 s there are five channels : @xmath40 .    in fig .",
    "5 we show , as an example , the running mass , @xmath41 , and the width - like function , @xmath42 , for the i=1 channel .",
    "the crossing point of the running mass with @xmath35 gives the @xmath43 mass of the .",
    "the magnitude of the  component in the  is determined by @xmath44 , which is large in the resonance region just below the  threshold .",
    "these functions fix the pwa of eq .",
    "( 1 ) and fig .  3 .",
    "6 the running mass and width - like function for the strange channel are shown .",
    "these fix the shape of the @xmath27 phase shift and absorption parameters in fig .",
    "1 . as can be seen from figs .  1 - 3 , the model gives a good description of the relevant data .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the  was missed because only poles nearest to the physical region were looked for , and the possibility of the resonance doubling phenomenon , discussed below , was overlooked .",
    "only a little later we realized with roos @xcite that two resonances (  and @xmath45 ) can emerge although only one @xmath6 bare state is put in .",
    "in fact , it was pointed out by morgan and pennington  @xcite that for each  state there are , in general , apart from the nearest pole , also image poles , usually located far from the physical region . as explained in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of these can ( for a large enough coupling and sufficiently heavy threshold ) come so close to the physical region that they make new resonances . and ,",
    "in fact , there are more than four physical poles with different isospin , in the output spectrum of the uqm model , although only four bare states are put in!. the  and the  of the model thus turn out to be two manifestations of the same   state ( see @xcite and fig . 7 for details ) .",
    "there can be two crossings with the running mass @xmath41 , one near the threshold and another at higher mass , and each one is related to a different pole at the second sheet ( or , if the coupling is strong enough , the lower one could even become a bound state pole , below the threshold , on the first sheet ) .    similarly the  and the  could be two manifestations of the @xmath46 state . only after realizing that this resonance doubling is important we looked deeper into the second sheet and found the light and broad  @xcite .    another important effect that the model can explain",
    "is the large mass difference between the @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "because of this large splitting many authors argue that the @xmath25 and @xmath4 are not  states , since in addition to being very close to the  threshold , they are much lighter than the first strange scalar , the @xmath26 . naively one expects a mass difference between the strange and nonstrange meson to be of the order of the strange - nonstrange quark mass difference , or a little over 100 mev .",
    "this is also one of the reasons why some authors want to have a lighter strange meson , the @xmath49 , near 800 mev .",
    "cherry and pennington @xcite recently have strongly argued against its existence .",
    "figs . 5 and 6",
    "explain why one can easily understand this large mass splitting as a secondary effect of the large pseudoscalar mass splittings , and because of the large mass shifts coming from the loop diagrams involving the pp thresholds .",
    "if one puts figs . 4 and 5 on top of each other one sees that the 3 thresholds @xmath50 all lie relatively close to the @xmath25 , and all 3 contribute to a large mass shift .",
    "on the other hand , for the @xmath26 , the @xmath51 related thresholds ( @xmath52 ) lie far apart from the @xmath48 , while the @xmath53 nearly decouples because of the physical value of the pseudoscalar mixing angle .",
    "the recent experiments studying charm decay to light hadrons are opening up a new experimental window for understanding light meson spectroscopy and especially the controversial scalar mesons , which are copiously produced in these decays .",
    "in particular we refer to the e791 study of the @xmath54 decay @xcite where it is shown how adding an intermediate scalar resonance with floating mass and width in the monte carlo program simulating the dalitz plot densities , allows for an excellent fit to data provided the mass and the width of this scalar resonance are @xmath55 mev and @xmath56 mev .",
    "this resonance is a very good candidate for the @xmath1 . to check this hypothesis we adopt the e791 experimental values for its mass and width and using a constituent",
    "quark meson model ( cqm ) for heavy - light meson decays @xcite we compute the @xmath57 non - leptonic process via _ factorization _",
    "@xcite and taking the coupling of the @xmath1 to the light quarks from the linear sigma model @xcite .",
    "in such a way one is directly assuming that the scalar state needed in the e791 analysis could be the quantum of the @xmath1 field of the linear sigma model .",
    "according to the cqm model and to factorization , the amplitude describing the @xmath57 decay can be written as a product of the semileptonic amplitude @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the axial quark current , and @xmath60 .",
    "the former is parameterized by two form factors , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , connected by the condition @xmath63 , while the latter is governed by the pion decay constant @xmath64 .",
    "as far as the product of the two above mentioned amplitudes is concerned , only the form factor @xmath62 comes into the expression of the @xmath57 amplitude . moreover we need to estimate it at @xmath65 , that is the physically realized kinematical situation .",
    "cqm offers the possibility to compute this form factor through two quark - meson 1-loop diagrams that we call the _ direct _ and the _ polar _ contributions to @xmath62 .",
    "these quark - meson loops are possible since in the cqm one has effective vertices ( heavy quark)-(heavy meson)-(light quark ) that allow to _ compute _ spectator - like diagrams in which usually the external lines represent incoming or outgoing heavy mesons while the internal lines are the constituent light quark and heavy quark propagators .    in figs .",
    "8 and 9 we show respectively the _ direct _ and the _ polar _ diagrams for the semileptonic amplitude @xmath66 , the former being characterized by the axial current directly attached to the constituent quark loop , the latter involving an intermediate @xmath67 or @xmath68 state .",
    "these two diagrams are computed with an analogous technique and one finally obtains a determination of the direct and polar form factors @xmath69 .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath70 is safe for the direct form factor while is not perfectly under control for the polar form factor since the latter is more reliable at the pole @xmath71 , @xmath72 being the mass of the intermediate state in fig .",
    "we take into account the uncertainty introduced by this extrapolation procedure and signaled by the fact that we find @xmath73 ( computing @xmath74 from the polar diagram with @xmath75 intermediate polar state and @xmath76 from that with intermediate @xmath77 state ) .",
    "our estimate for @xmath78 is in reasonable agreement with an estimate of @xmath79 carried out in @xcite using the e791 data analysis and a breit - wigner like approximation for the @xmath1 .",
    "this computation indicates that the scalar resonance described in the e791 paper can be consistently understood as the @xmath1 of the linear sigma model .",
    "of course a calculation such as the one here described calls for alternative calculations and/or explanations of the e791 data for a valuable and useful comparison of point of views on the @xmath1 nature .",
    "an often raised question is : why are the mass shifts required by unitarity so much more important for the scalars than , say , for the vector mesons ?",
    "the answer is very simple , and there are two main reasons apart from chiral symmetry constraints :    * the scalar coupling to two pseudoscalars is very much larger than the corresponding coupling for the vectors , both experimentally and theoretically ( e.g. , spin counting gives 3 for the ratio of the two squared couplings ) .",
    "* for the scalars the thresholds are s - waves , giving nonlinear square root cusps in the @xmath80 function , whereas for the vectors the thresholds are p - waves , giving a smooth @xmath81 angular momentum and phase space factor .",
    ".2 cm    one could argue that the two states  and  are a kind of @xmath12 bound states ( c.f . ref .",
    "@xcite ) , since these have a large component of virtual @xmath12 in their wave functions .",
    "however , the dynamics of these states is quite different from that of normal two - hadron bound states . if one wants to consider them as  bound states , it is the @xmath82 interaction which creates their binding energy , not the hyperfine interaction as in ref .",
    "thus , although they may spend most of their time as @xmath12 , they owe their existence to the   state .",
    "therefore , it is more natural to consider the  and  as two manifestations of the same   state",
    ".    the wave function of the @xmath25 ( and @xmath4 ) can be pictured as a relatively small core of  of typical  meson size ( 0.6fm ) , which is surrounded by a much larger standing s - wave of virtual .",
    "this picture also gives a physical explanation of the narrow width : in order to decay to @xmath29 , the  component must first virtually annihilate near the origin to .",
    "then the  can decay to @xmath29 as an ozi allowed decay .",
