    "recent experimental observations of topologically protected magnetic skyrmion structures in a variety of systems ranging from bulk chiral magnets @xcite through multiferroic materials @xcite to thin films @xcite require theoretical efforts to understand their formation , stability and other physical properties that can be exploited in technological applications @xcite .",
    "an important issue is the study of finite temperature effects on the skyrmion stability @xcite .",
    "so far , the smallest skyrmions have been observed in ultrathin films at low temperature @xcite , where their diameter can be as small as a few nanometers @xcite .",
    "such real - space spin structures can conveniently be imaged by using spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) @xcite .",
    "the controlled manipulation ( creation and annihilation ) of skyrmions by sp - stm @xcite is a key to write and delete information in magnetic media .",
    "another important aspect is the systematic understanding of the sp - stm contrasts of skyrmionic structures with different topologies .",
    "dup et al .",
    "reported sp - stm contrast characteristics for a set of metastable skyrmions @xcite , where they identified circular contrasts using an out - of - plane magnetized tip and two types of contrasts employing an in - plane magnetized tip : ( i ) a two - lobes contrast for spin structures with topological charge @xmath5 and ( ii ) a four - lobes contrast for a higher - order antiskyrmion with @xmath6 .",
    "the discovery of other types of metastable skyrmionic structures in the ( pt@xmath1ir@xmath2)fe / pd(111 ) ultrathin magnetic film @xcite enables the generalization of the findings of dup et al .  for the sp - stm contrasts of topologically distinct skyrmions .",
    "our work identifies stm contrast rules by investigating metastable skyrmionic spin structures with various topological charges ( @xmath0 ) in the ( pt@xmath1ir@xmath2)fe / pd(111 ) ultrathin magnetic film employing sp - stm simulations .",
    "we suggest that these rules enable the topological characterization of skyrmionic spin structures ( magnitude and sign of @xmath4 ) based on experimentally measured sp - stm images using a minimum of two linearly independent in - plane tip magnetization orientations .",
    "we propose that our stm contrast rules are general for skyrmionic structures in other ultrathin films providing an isotropic environment , and they are not valid in anisotropic environments of skyrmion formation @xcite , e.g. , in reconstructed or confined film geometries , since distorted skyrmion shapes strongly affect the observed stm contrast .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the method section describes the employed sp - stm simulation method and parameters used .",
    "after that , sp - stm simulation results are presented and discussed , and conclusions are drawn on the relationship between the stm contrast and the skyrmion topology .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     based on our above findings , we suggest that if a single sp - stm measurement with an in - plane sensitive magnetic tip provides inequal numbers of bright and dark contrast regions then it can be excluded that the imaged spin structure has a @xmath7 topological charge .",
    "additionally , the detection of a non - preserved number of bright and dark contrast regions upon in - plane tip rotation suggests a topological charge of @xmath8 .",
    "these suggestions are , however , not generally true and apply to skyrmions formed in isotropic environment only .",
    "we have to stress that the shape of the magnetic skyrmions formed in anisotropic environments , e.g. , in reconstructed films @xcite , considerably affects the observed in - plane stm contrast and our above statements .",
    "such an example is an axially non - symmetric spin structure derived from experimental stm contrasts in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows both equal and inequal numbers of bright and dark contrast regions imaged with in - plane magnetized tips .",
    "a deeper theoretical analysis puts forward that the observed spin structure is indeed a magnetic skyrmion with @xmath5 exhibiting a non - circular shape @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity of the out - of - plane stm contrast of this reported skyrmion and our skyrmion with @xmath9 [ see fig .  [ fig2](d ) ] .",
    "the comparison of the in - plane contrasts in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] and those of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , excludes the @xmath9 skyrmion in the experiment .",
    "the reason for the distorted shape of the skyrmions in the experiment is the modified exchange interactions due to the reconstructed geometry of the magnetic film .",
    "a similar effect has also been observed in another complex magnetic ( spin spiral ) state in a confined geometry @xcite .",
    "we propose that theoretical calculations of such geometrically modified exchange interactions will explain the formation of distorted real - space magnetic textures in the future .",
    "we have investigated metastable skyrmionic spin structures with various topological charges ( @xmath0 ) in the ( pt@xmath1ir@xmath2)fe / pd(111 ) ultrathin magnetic film by means of spin - polarized scanning tunneling microscopy ( sp - stm ) simulations .",
    "we found that an out - of - plane magnetized tip already results in distinguished stm contrasts for the different skyrmions . using an in - plane magnetized tip ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the magnitude of the topological charge can be determined from the image contrast of a single sp - stm measurement : the number of bright and dark contrast regions alternating along the perimeter of the skyrmion equals @xmath3 each .",
    "we highlighted that an in - plane tip magnetization rotation provides the sign of @xmath4 independently on the sign of the effective spin polarization in the tunnel junction : in - phase rotation of the contrast with respect to the tip magnetization indicates skyrmions ( @xmath10 ) and anti - phase rotation antiskyrmions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "a special case has been identified , the `` chimera '' skyrmion with @xmath8 exhibiting a skyrmionic and an antiskyrmionic part , where the number of bright and dark contrast regions is not preserved upon in - plane tip magnetization rotation .",
    "we propose that our stm contrast rules are general for skyrmionic structures in other ultrathin films providing an isotropic environment , and they are not valid in anisotropic environments of skyrmion formation , e.g. , in reconstructed or confined film geometries .",
    "our results for the identification of the topology of skyrmionic structures can prove to be useful for engineering skyrmions in ultrathin films for practical applications in the future .",
