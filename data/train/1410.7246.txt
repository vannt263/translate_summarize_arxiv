    "the surface water wave problem considered here concerns the motion of an inviscid incompressible fluid with a free surface and over an impenetrable rigid bottom . the mathematical description of this motion involves the euler equations for perfect fluids coupled with free - surface boundary conditions .",
    "solving these equations presents a rather complex mathematical problem , and in many instances , it can be expedient to use an approximate model for the description of the free surface and the motion of the fluid below .",
    "the classical simplifications of this problem are the linear theory which may be used for waves of small amplitude , and the shallow water theory , which may be used for long waves .",
    "a third class of approximations can be found in the so - called boussinesq scaling which requires a certain relationship between the amplitude and wavelength of the waves to be described    the green - naghdi system was derived as a long - wave model for surface water waves which are long , but which may not necessarily have small amplitude . in fact , the green - naghdi system was first found in the special case of one - dimensional waves over a flat bottom @xcite , in which case it can be thought of as a higher - order nonlinear shallow - water system .",
    "the system was later extended to two - dimensional surface waves @xcite , and put into the general context of fluid sheets by @xcite .",
    "if @xmath0 is a characteristic wavelength and @xmath1 is the the mean water depth , we define the dimensionless small parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the green - naghdi equations are obtained by depth - averaging the euler system and truncating the resulting set of equations at second order in @xmath3 ; without making any assumptions on the amplitude of the waves .",
    "while the studies mentioned so far give a formal justification of the green - naghdi system as a wave model accommodating larger amplitude waves , a mathematical justification of this property was given for the green - naghdi and some related systems in @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen increased activity in both the study of modeling properties of the green - naghdi system ( @xcite ) and in the development of numerical discretization techniques , such as in @xcite .",
    "the green - naghdi system is usually written in terms of the average horizontal velocity @xmath4 and the total flow depth @xmath5 , and take the form @xmath6 @xmath7 note that if higher - order terms in are discarded , the system reduces to the classical shallow - water system .",
    "on the other hand , considering waves of infinitesimally small amplitude , one obtains the linearization of the green - naghdi system , which is identical to the linearized classical boussinesq system @xcite .",
    "smooth solutions of , also satisfy the following conservation laws : @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11the conservation law is easily seen to describe mass conservation .",
    "it can also be shown that represents momentum conservation and represents the energy conservation in the green - naghdi approximation .",
    "the last conservation law is not easily interpreted .",
    "some authors have ascribed the conservation of angular momentum to this balance equation . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite that it originates from the particle relabeling symmetry for a corresponding approximate lagrangian of the euler equations .    in the present work",
    ", the focus will be on giving a precise physical meaning to the quantities appearing in the fourth conservation law .",
    "as will come to light , the density appearing in the conservation law is proportional to the tangential fluid velocity at the free interface , while the flux can be interpreted as an approximation of the energy per unit mass of fluid .",
    "the conservation law derives from a corresponding balance law which holds exactly for the surface water - wave problem for the full euler equations , and can be written in lagrangian variables as @xmath12here @xmath13 denotes the fluid velocity , @xmath14 is the fluid particle motion , @xmath15 is the pressure , and @xmath16 is the density .",
    "the variable @xmath17 featuring in this balance law denotes a parametrization of an arc lying entirely in the fluid domain or in the free surface . in the particular case where the arc is located in the free surface",
    ", the term @xmath18 can be interpreted as the tangent velocity along the free surface , multiplied by the local element of arclength .",
    "the balance law provides the basis for the conservation law in the green - naghdi approximation .",
    "this conservation law actually holds even for the three - dimensional water - wave problem , but in this case , an additional term enters the corresponding identity in the green - naghdi approximation , so that the identity corresponding to in three dimensions is not a pure conservation law .",
    "the disposition of the present paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe how to obtain the balance equation in the context of the full euler equations .",
    "then , the green - naghdi approximation is considered , and the associate approximate density and flux are obtained using a method introduced in @xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "the three - dimensional case is considered , and section 5 contains a brief discussion .",
    "the motion of a homogeneous inviscid fluid with a free surface over a flat bottom can be described by the euler equations with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the unknowns are the surface elevation @xmath19 , and the horizontal and vertical fluid velocity components @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the problem may be posed on a domain @xmath22 which extends to infinity in the positive and negative @xmath23-direction .",
    "the two - dimensional euler equations are @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the velocity field , and @xmath26 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the free - surface boundary conditions are given by requiring the pressure to be equal to atmospheric pressure at the surface , i.e. @xmath27 if surface tension effects are neglected , and the kinematic boundary condition @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we work with the gauge pressure , so that we may take @xmath30 .",
    "we are interested in the integral of the velocity field along a portion of the free surface , and its evolution in time .",
    "let @xmath31 be a material arc lying entirely in the free surface ( cf . figure 1 ) .",
    "we define the _ total drift _ along the arc @xmath31 as @xmath32 it is convenient with a view towards the three - dimensional problem to take a somewhat more general approach , and consider the integral of the velocity over a material arc in the fluid . to this end , we introduce semi - lagrangian coordinates . following zakharov @xcite , the change of variables @xmath33 is given by the function @xmath34where @xmath35 is the solution of the equation@xmath36with the initial condition @xmath37where @xmath38 is the initial disturbance of the free surface . at each time @xmath39",
    ", this change of variables represents a foliation of the domain in @xmath40 variables by contact lines indexed by @xmath41 , and where each line corresponds to @xmath42 in the @xmath43-plane . the free surface @xmath44 corresponds to the value @xmath45 .",
    "it can be shown that in semi - lagrangian coordinates , the material derivative is defined only in terms of the horizontal velocity , and the curvilinear domain occupied by the fluid in the plane @xmath46 maps to a strip in the plane @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a finite material arc lying entirely in one of the contact lines defined above , starting at a point @xmath49 , and ending at another point @xmath50 .",
    "the arc corresponding to the value @xmath45 lies entirely in the free surface , and will be denoted simply by @xmath51 as already introduced above .     which lies entirely in the free surface.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    parametrizing the initial arc @xmath52 using the real parameter @xmath17",
    ", we obtain the description of the arc @xmath48 in the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the solution of the cauchy problem @xmath55using the euler equations , one can obtain the time evolution of the total drift along @xmath56 in the form @xmath57one may use standard transformations to see that the integral relation can also be written as the local equation along the material curve @xmath56 .",
    "in fact , the previous computation is nothing but the standard proof of kelvin s circulation theorem , but applied on a contour which is not necessarily closed .",
    "taking a contour embedded in the free surface , the pressure vanishes , and we obtain the simpler conservation law @xmath58 in order to understand the density in , we let @xmath59 be the unit normal to the free surface , scaled by the element of arclength of the free surface . by the same token , @xmath60 is the unit tangent vector to the free surface , scaled by the element of arclength .",
    "we set @xmath61and observe that we have @xmath62at the free surface .",
    "finally , in eulerian coordinates , we have @xmath63this is an exact conservation law representing the evolution of the tangent velocity @xmath64 along the free surface .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that @xmath64 falls under the scope of the work of benjamin and olver @xcite if the density @xmath65 in @xcite is differentiated with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the physical interpretation of @xmath64 is new .      in order to understand the approximation of in the green - naghdi theory",
    ", we recall the scaling which is used in the derivation of the system , .",
    "define the non - dimensional variables @xmath66 using this scaling , the quantity @xmath67 is given in non - dimensional variables as @xmath68 and the conservation law turns into @xmath69 substituting the expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath71 obtained in the derivation of the green - naghdi system yields @xmath72using similar reasoning as in @xcite , we define the non - dimensional quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 by @xmath75and @xmath76then the balance is @xmath77using the natural scalings @xmath78 and @xmath79 , the dimensional forms of these quantities are given by @xmath80 @xmath81 respectively .",
    "while the preceding analysis shows that the conservation law @xmath82 holds approximately to second order in @xmath3 , it can be seen immediately that the density @xmath83 and the flux @xmath84 are the same as the respective quantities in , so that is an exact identity .",
    "it is interesting to see what happens in the shallow - water approximation where the balance @xmath85 only holds to the order of @xmath3 . in this case , we obtain @xmath86 for the density and @xmath87 for the flux .",
    "thus in this case the equation @xmath88 also holds exactly , and in fact it is just the second equation in the shallow - water system .",
    "it can be seen clearly from this form that this is a balance law relating horizontal velocity energy density per unit mass . in the shallow - water theory ,",
    "the horizontal velocity is taken to be uniform throughout the fluid column , so that the simple form for @xmath83 and @xmath84 is achieved .",
    "however , in the present theory , the horizontal velocity is assumed to vary quadratically with the depth .",
    "this results in a more complicated set of equations , and may also be used advantageously for kinematic studies of the fluid motion , such as in @xcite .",
    "the euler equation , are written in general form , and may also be interpreted to hold in three dimensions , for a velocity field @xmath89 , a pressure @xmath90 and body forcing @xmath91 . in this case , the kinematic free surface boundary condition is given by @xmath92 at @xmath93 . note that for the purpose of this last section , we define the horizontal spatial coordinates , velocity vector field , gradient and material derivative by @xmath94respectively .",
    "an analogous vector law for the evolution of the tangent velocity can also be derived in three - dimensional case .",
    "let @xmath95 be defined by @xmath96 be the free surface , which is assumed can be projected onto the horizontal plane @xmath97 . as before , we will introduce a special lagrangian coordinate @xmath98 corresponding to the foliation of the fluid domain by the material surfaces @xmath99 .",
    "the free surface @xmath100 will correspond to the value @xmath101 .",
    "such a foliation can be achieved by solving the cauchy problem for the equation @xmath102 with the initial condition @xmath103and making then the change of variables @xmath104 , @xmath105    then we introduce the lagrangian coordinates @xmath106 which may be taken as the @xmath107 coordinates of a particle at time @xmath108 each surface @xmath109 is thus parametrized by the same parameters @xmath110 the change of variables is assumed to be invertible : @xmath111 , for @xmath112 the lagrangian coordinates @xmath113 are conserved along the particle trajectories in the eulerian coordinates .",
    "this implies that the transport equation for the lagrangian coordinates @xmath114 reduces to @xmath115 in the coordinates @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath117 taking the horizontal gradient @xmath118 of yields @xmath119since the matrix @xmath120 is symmetric , can be written in the form @xmath121 in analogy with the two - dimensional case , one may take the drift along each @xmath122 curve contained in the contact surface @xmath109 to obtain conservation laws analogous to in the form @xmath123where @xmath124 is the motion of particles along the surfaces @xmath125 evaluating at the free surface @xmath45 yields a formula analogous to . defining @xmath126 in analogy with the two - dimensional case , we can define the tangent component of the velocity vector at the free surface as @xmath127taking the partial derivative of @xmath128 with respect to time at fixed lagrangian coordinates @xmath106 we obtain @xmath129@xmath130converting to eulerian coordinates , we obtain @xmath131using , we may write the last relation as @xmath132this equation may also be written as @xmath133 \\mathbf{u}_h   + \\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{k}}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}_h}\\right)^t   \\ !       \\mathbf{u}_h",

    "moreover , it can be shown that @xmath135 can be written in the form @xmath136where @xmath137 is evaluated at the surface and @xmath138 is the vertical velocity evaluated at the interface .",
    "this is a natural generalization of the one - dimensional case considered before . since the vertical velocity @xmath138 at the free surface",
    "is given by @xmath139 may be rewritten in the form @xmath140 the equation or is an _ exact consequence of the euler equations _ expressed in terms of variables evaluated at the free surface . since @xmath135 is a vector in the @xmath141plane ( see ) , the vector @xmath142 has only one non - zero component and is orthogonal to the @xmath141plane .",
    "note that in the present three - dimensional case , the density @xmath135 is not covered by the results of @xcite because becomes a conservation law only if @xmath143 = 0 .",
    "next , we consider the approximation of in the green - naghdi regime .",
    "recall that the green - naghdi equations for three - dimensional flows are written in terms of the depth - averaged horizontal velocity @xmath144 and the total flow depth @xmath145 as @xmath146 @xmath147 where @xmath148 @xmath149.\\ ] ] in order to obtain an unbiased representation , we write the non - dimensionalized version of in terms of the principal unknown variables of the green - naghdi equation . thus in non - dimensional form , becomes @xmath150as shown in the appendix , the non - dimensional horizontal velocity field @xmath151 , and the vertical velocity component @xmath152 are given in the green - naghdi approximation at any location @xmath153 in the fluid by the following expressions in terms of the depth averaged velocity : @xmath154@xmath155moreover , in the appendix , the following important relation is established : @xmath156this relation holds as long as irrotational solutions of euler s equations are considered .",
