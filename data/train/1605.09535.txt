    "multifactorial diseases are disorders that involve multiple disease - causing mechanisms , such as genes acting in concert with environmental factors .",
    "the represent one of the most significant challenges that medical research faces today @xcite .",
    "disease - causing mechanisms may be ( and typically are ) involved in more than one disorder @xcite .",
    "if two diseases are related to the same mechanism ( say , a single point mutation , snp , or an altered metabolic pathway ) , they have a tendency to co - occur in the same patients @xcite . here we develop a novel network - medicine approach to quantify the relative contributions of genetic and environmental risk factors for diseases .",
    "the central idea of the approach is illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we consider three diseases @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( circles ) and assume that diseases @xmath0 and @xmath1 co - occur very frequently in patients ( thick line ) , whereas diseases @xmath0 and @xmath2 rarely coincide within patients ( thin line ) . assume further that @xmath0 can arise through two different disease - causing mechanisms , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where mechanism @xmath3 is also responsible for ( or involved in ) disease @xmath2 and mechanism @xmath4 for disease @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , mechanism @xmath4 explains the observed disease phenotype @xmath0 ( the frequent co - occurrence with disease @xmath1 ) much better than mechanism @xmath3 and is therefore a more probable causes for disease @xmath0 .",
    "using this idea we are able to identify the most likely causes and are able to disentangle genetic and environmental disease - causing mechanisms for 358 different disease phenotypes .",
    "we consider the three most important classes of disease - causing mechanisms .",
    "( i ) _ genetic _ mechanisms relate a disease to a specific defect or alteration in the genome .",
    "if one such defect is related to two or more pathologies , then those diseases share a genetic comorbidity .",
    "for example , it was shown that the phenotypic comorbidity between schizophrenia and parkinson s disease is almost entirely accounted for by snps in loci near nt5c2 and hla - dra @xcite .",
    "( ii ) _ pathway - based _ mechanisms are given by a defective pathway ( e.g. metabolic or signal transduction pathway ) that is involved in the etiology of the disease .",
    "pathway - based comorbidities indicate that two diseases are related to different defects in the same pathway .",
    "for instance , it is known that the pi3k / akt pathway up - regulates anti - inflammatory cytokines and inhibits proinflammatory cytokines such as il-1b , il-6 , tnf-@xmath5 , and ifn-@xmath6 that show increased levels in patients with major depressive disorder @xcite .",
    "also , inactivation of the pi3k / akt pathway through the suppression of insulin receptor substrates ( irs ) may act as the underlying mechanism for the metabolic syndrome ( i.e. the frequent concurrence of metabolic disorders such as hypertension , obesity , or diabetes ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , depression has been identified as an important comorbidity of the metabolic syndrome in various cross - sectional surveys @xcite . finally , ( iii ) _ toxicogenomic _ mechanisms characterize diseases caused by exposure to chemical substances that change the activity of certain genes .",
    "two diseases share a toxicogenomic comorbidity if they are related to different genes that interact with the same toxic substance .",
    "for example , the immunosuppressive chemical methoxychlor is used as pesticide and can cause atopic dermatitis , possibly by expressing il-13 in the skin @xcite .",
    "methoxychlor also promotes the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of kidney disease . upon prenatal exposure to methoxychlor during fetal gonadal development , offspring show increased incidence of adult - onset kidney disease that was related to differentially dna methylated regions @xcite .",
    "atopic dermatitis is indeed associated with the nephritic syndrome @xcite",
    ". there may be cases where the same diseases share genetic and environmental risk factors .",
    "such cases we regard as _ genetic _ comorbidities , because the genetic link represents a direct mechanism that explains a corresponding phenotypic comorbidity without the need for additional , environmental influences .",
    "the construction and analysis of networks of diseases that are connected by different comorbidity relations has recently lead to substantial progress in our understanding of the etiologies of various diseases @xcite .",
    "for instance , gene - disease associations collected in the online mendelian inheritance in man ( omim ) database @xcite can be used to construct a network where diseases are linked if they are related to the same mutations in one or several genes @xcite .",
    "this network allowed for the identification of clusters of diseases , such as cancers , which are held together by a small number of genes @xcite .",
    "another approach is to connect diseases if they are both associated with enzymes that catalyze reactions in the same pathway @xcite .",
    "protein - protein interaction data can be integrated with toxicogenomics data to construct a network where two diseases are linked if they are both caused by exposure to the same chemical , which has led to the successful identification of novel chemical - protein associations @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that diseases that are comorbid in the population tend to be related with clusters of proteins that are close to each other in the human protein - protein interaction network @xcite .",
    "different types of genomic , metabolomic , and proteomic disease - disease relations have also been combined to form an `` integrated disease network '' @xcite . in phenotypic comorbidity networks , nodes correspond to disease phenotypes that are linked if the two diseases tend to co - occur in the same patients @xcite .",
    "chronic , multifactorial disorders often assume the role of hubs in such networks ( i.e. nodes that are strongly connected with a large number of other diseases ) @xcite .    here",
    "we construct a generalized network that combines phenotypic comorbidity networks with those given by different types of shared disease - causing mechanisms ( genes , pathways , or exposure to chemicals ) , the _ human disease multiplex network _ ( hdmn )",
    "( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "multiplex networks are given by a set of nodes connected by multiple sets of links @xcite .",
    "one set of links in the hdmn corresponds to phenotypic comorbidity relations , whereas the other sets of links represent different classes of genetic or environmental mechanisms .",
    "we quantify how _ similar _ the phenotypic links of a particular disease are to its links in other layers in the hdmn .",
    "this allows us to derive scores for each disease of how well its phenotypic comorbidities can be explained by genetic , pathway - based , or toxicogenomic mechanisms . in this sense",
    "the derived scores quantify `` how genetic '' or how strong environmental influences are for a given disease .",
    "phenotypic disease - disease associations were obtained from a database of the main association of austrian social security institutions that contains pseudonymized claims data of all persons receiving inpatient care in austria between january 1st , 2006 and december 31st , 2007 @xcite .",
    "the data contains age , sex , main- and side - diagnoses ( icd10 codes ) @xcite for each hospital stay from @xmath7 patients .",
    "not all icd codes represent disorders , they may also indicate general examinations , injuries , collections of unspecific symptoms or disorders that are not classified elsewhere .",
    "unspecific codes are excluded and we work with the remaining @xmath8 diagnoses on the three - digit icd levels in chapters ( i.e. first - digit - levels ) @xmath3-@xmath9 , labeled by the capital index @xmath10 .",
    "we use the words disease , disorder and diagnosis interchangeably whenever referring to an icd entry .",
    "molecular disease - disease associations were obtained from molecular data of three types , namely purely genetic associations and two different types of environmental associations .",
    "( i ) _ genetic _ disease associations were extracted from the omim dataset @xcite , which provides a collection of gene - phenotype relationships .",
    "it contains for instance currently more than 30 genes that are known to play a role in type 2 diabetes , e.g. the aforementioned irs 2 gene .",
    "( ii ) _ pathway - based _ disease associations we took from the uniprotkb database @xcite .",
    "the uniprotkb database contains protein sequence and functional information that is cross - referenced with pathways in which the proteins play a role and the protein s involvement in diseases .",
    "for instance , an uniprot entry for the pi3-kinase protein cross - references about 40 different pathways , including the pi3k / akt activation pathway , in addition to three different disease phenotypes from the omim dataset .",
    "( iii ) _ toxicogenomic _ disease associations were obtained from the comparative toxicogenomic database ( ctd ) @xcite .",
    "entries in the ctd correspond to chemicals that are linked to diseases caused by exposure to the substance and with disease genes that are differentially expressed under exposure to it .",
    "for instance , according to this data the chemical methoxychlor is involved in more than ten different diseases , including atopic dermatitis where its influence is mediated by eight different genes , including il-13 . to link the molecular to the phenotypic data , a mapping between icd10 and omim disease identifiers had to be established . to obtain such mappings we compiled three different data sources , namely the human disease ontology database @xcite , orphanet @xcite , and wikipedia . for more information on data extraction and the construction of the icd10-omim mappings",
    "see si , text s1 . each of the three molecular datasets can be represented by a bipartite network @xmath11 , where @xmath5 labels the classes of mechanisms , i.e. genetic ( @xmath12 ) , pathway - based ( @xmath13 ) , or toxicogenomic ( @xmath14 ) , index @xmath0 labels disorders ( icd10 codes ) and * j * labels unique genes ( if @xmath12 ) , pathways ( if @xmath13 ) , or chemicals ( if @xmath14 ) .",
    "we set @xmath15 , if there exists is at least one relation between disease @xmath0 and gene / pathway / chemical * j * , @xmath16 , otherwise .",
    "_ heritability and drug approvals .",
    "_ information on the broad - sense heritability ( see si , text s2 ) of individual diseases @xmath0 , @xmath17 , was taken from the snpedia database @xcite . as a source for drug approvals we used the drugs@fda database from which we obtained fda - approved brand names and approval dates for all drug products approved since 1939 .",
    "these drugs were mapped via known molecular targets to diseases @xcite to obtain the number of newly approved drug products of the last twenty years for the specific disease @xmath0 , @xmath18 .",
    "we constructed a multi - layer network that encodes disease - disease associations of four different types , the hdmn , @xmath19 .",
    "this network contains one phenotypic layer , @xmath20 , and three layers that encode molecular disease - disease associations , @xmath21 .",
    "the layer of phenotypic disease associations , @xmath22 , is given by the contingency coefficient , @xmath23 , between diseases @xmath0 and @xmath1 : here @xmath24 is the number of patients with disease @xmath0 .",
    "for each pair of diseases @xmath25 we counted the number of patients that have both diseases ( @xmath26 ) , only disease @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( @xmath27 or @xmath28 , respectively ) , or neither disease ( @xmath29 ) . here",
    ", the bar denotes `` not '' .",
    "entries in the phenotypic disease network , @xmath22 , are then given by the contingency coefficient , @xmath30 values of @xmath23 are within the range @xmath31 $ ] and measure the phenotypic comorbidity strength between diseases @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the higher ( lower ) @xmath23 , the higher ( lower ) the probability that a patient with disease @xmath0 also suffers disease @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath32 indicates that occurrences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are independent from each other .",
    "we set @xmath33 , whenever the patient numbers are too low to allow for a reliable estimate of @xmath23 , i.e. whenever one of the possible outcomes for @xmath26 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 was below 5 . an age - dependent version of the phenotypic disease network for a given age interval @xmath37 is denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "patients fall within one of 11 age groups , 0y-7y , 8y-15y ,  , 80y-87y .",
    "the layers 2 , 3 , and 4 of the hdmn encode three different types of molecular associations , @xmath21 .",
    "each of these layers , @xmath39 , is obtained from the bipartite network @xmath40 as follows , @xmath41 note that this definition ensures that associations between pathologies @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the pathway , @xmath42 , and toxicogenomic , @xmath43 , layers are indeed due to shared pathways or exposure to the same chemical that can not be explained by direct genetic causes ( i.e. @xmath44 ) .",
    "the numbers of non - isolated nodes , @xmath45 , and links , @xmath46 , for each layer @xmath5 are shown in the si , table s[data ] .",
    "diseases are not included in the hdmn if they are isolated in every molecular layer @xmath47,@xmath48 , or @xmath49 .",
    "links in the phenotypic layer @xmath50 are weighted and typically close to zero @xcite .",
    "numbers for @xmath45 are between 200 and 300 for the molecular layers , whereas there are more than 350 nodes in the phenotypic layer .",
    "we introduce a relative risk indicator @xmath51 that measures how similar the phenotypic comorbidities of disease @xmath0 are to its genetic , pathway - based , or toxicogenomic comorbidities . in this sense @xmath51",
    "quantifies how much a specific class of disease - causing mechanisms contributes to the phenotype @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath51 is the quotient of the average comorbidity strengths , @xmath22 , of all diseases that are linked to @xmath0 in layer @xmath19 , and the comorbidity strengths of those diseases that are linked to @xmath0 in none of the pathophysiological layers , i.e. , @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the degree of disease @xmath0 in layer @xmath5 given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a control set of links for disease @xmath0 that contains all links @xmath1 , @xmath56 , for which @xmath57 .",
    "for convenience we also defined the logarithmic relative comorbidity risk , @xmath58 .",
    "a value of @xmath59 close to zero indicates that the presence of pathophysiological comorbidities of type @xmath5 have no relation whatsoever to the actual , phenotypic comorbidities of @xmath0 . with increasingly positive values of @xmath59 ,",
    "the probability increases that the pathophysiological comorbidities of @xmath0 are indeed observed in the population .",
    "note that the relative comorbidity risk @xmath59 can be large due to a single comorbidity @xmath1 of type @xmath5 with a very high phenotypic comorbidity strength @xmath22 , or because there are a large number of comorbidities with only moderately increased comorbidity strengths .",
    "in particular , @xmath59 might favor diseases that have a large number of connections of type @xmath5 to diseases that are physiologically very similar and that have similar icd10 diagnosis codes , see text s1 . to adjust for these biases we rescaled @xmath59 by the node degree @xmath53 to obtain a measure that favors diseases with a smaller number of highly relevant disease - causing mechanisms .",
    "the re - scaled comorbidity risk , @xmath60 , is given by @xmath61 .",
    "we performed two different statistical tests to evaluate whether @xmath59 is significantly greater than zero .",
    "first , a wilcoxon rank sum test for equal medians of two samples was performed .",
    "the samples were given by the set of comorbidity strengths @xmath22 of all diseases @xmath1 that share a link of type @xmath5 with @xmath0 , @xmath62 , and the set @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath64-value for @xmath59 , @xmath65 , was obtained from the one - sided wilcoxon rank sum test against the alternative hypothesis that the median of @xmath66 is smaller than the median of @xmath67 .",
    "a benjamini - hochberg multiple hypothesis testing correction was applied on each layer using an exploratory threshold for the false discovery rate of @xmath68 ( which corresponds to thresholds for the adjusted @xmath64-values in the range between 0.1 and 0.05 ) .",
    "second , we performed a randomization test for @xmath59 where we replace @xmath19 by a random permutation of its elements , denoted by @xmath69 .",
    "the randomized @xmath70 was computed from equation [ rr ] where @xmath19 was replaced by @xmath69 . for a given @xmath5",
    ", @xmath69 has the same number of nodes and links as @xmath19 , but is otherwise completely randomized .",
    "the estimates of the most probable disease causes can be visualized in a three - dimensional representation where the axes show the genetic , pathway - based , and toxicogenomic comorbidity risks .",
    "each disease corresponds to a point with coordinates @xmath71 , see figure [ fig3](a ) and its projections onto the ( b ) @xmath72 , ( c ) @xmath73 , and ( d ) @xmath74 planes .",
    "the size of each marker is proportional to the frequency @xmath75 of disease @xmath0 .",
    "we set @xmath76 for all diseases where @xmath59 is not significantly different from zero after the multiple hypothesis testing correction .",
    "the majority of disorders are clearly dominated by genetic risk factors ( many points are close to the @xmath77-axis ) .",
    "some disorders cluster around the @xmath48 and @xmath49 axes indicating purely pathway - based and toxicogenomic origins .",
    "intriguingly , there is precisely no disease that has a significant pathway - based _ and _ toxicogenomic comorbidity risk at the same time , see figure [ fig3](d ) .",
    "however , a number of disorders with significant pathway - based or toxicogenomic risks have also significant genetic contributions , see figures [ fig4](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "this can also be seen in table [ top10 ] , where for instance the chronic nephritic syndrome ranks high in genetic and toxicogenomic comorbidity risks .",
    "the per - link contributions , @xmath60 , of three types of pathophysiological mechanisms are shown in figures [ fig3](e)-(h ) .",
    "almost all disorders show one dominant comorbidity risk contribution , i.e. they cluster around a single axis . again , most diseases show large genetic risks , while some cluster around the @xmath48 and @xmath49 axes . in the supporting information ,",
    "si figure 2 , we show results for @xmath60 where we allow comorbidities that are at the same time genetic and pathway - based / toxicogenomic ( i.e. we drop the second condition for @xmath19 in equation [ mij ] ) .",
    "there are now disorders with , both , significant pathway - based and toxicogenomic comorbidity risks . for these comorbidities , however , there exists also a direct genetic mechanism that may account for the phenotypic comorbidities .    table [ top10 ] shows the diseases with the largest genetic , pathway - based , or toxicogenomic comorbidity risks , ranked by statistical significance .",
    "the top genetic diseases include schizo - affective and delusional disorders , as well as schizophrenia .",
    "different forms of osteoarthritis and chronic bronchitis , as well as nephrotic and nephritic syndromes also show high genetic comorbidity risks .",
    "the top pathway - based diseases are major depressive disorders , endocrine disorders such as obesity and amyloidosis , diseases of the nervous systems including epilepsy and extrapyramidal and movement disorders , as well as disorders of bone density and multiple myeloma .",
    "the top toxicogenomic diseases include various forms of dermatitis and other skin diseases such as lichen simplex chronicus and prurigo , but also aortic aneurysms , and the chronic nephritic syndrome .",
    "schizophrenia is indeed a highly heritable disorder that is associated with more than hundred gene loci @xcite .",
    "the large pathway - based risk for depressions is corroborated by strong and supposedly bi - directional associations between the metabolic syndrome and depression , which have been a long - standing puzzle in epidemiological studies @xcite .",
    "depressions also exhibit strongly significant genetic comorbidity risks ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) in consistency with the finding of a gene - by - environment interaction where individuals with a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter ( 5-ht t ) gene exhibited more depressive symptoms in relation to stressful life events @xcite .",
    "the high toxicogenomic risks for aortic aneurysms are in line with the effects of chemicals such as nicotine and prostaglandin on related disease - genes @xcite .",
