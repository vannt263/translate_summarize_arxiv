    "one of the motivations for making a small and efficient laser is to enter a regime where quantum correlations in the emitted light can be created and studied . for this purpose",
    "spontaneous photons must be emitted into the cavity mode with high efficiency ( the @xmath1 factor ) , so that the noise from the random emission in other modes is small @xcite . at the same time , the lifetime of the lasing mode needs to be large enough , to allow for stimulated emission .",
    "the fabrication of dielectric microstructures , like microspheres @xcite and vcsels ( vertical cavity surface - emitting lasers ) @xcite for the realization of strong coupling and high finesse is therefore a big challenge for cavity qed - type experiments . from a fundamental point of view",
    "this also raises the question : what are the different types of systems where a small mode volume is still compatible with little leakage ?",
    "neither an ideal sphere @xcite nor a stack of disks ( an ideal vcsel ) , for example , give rise to mathematically bound solutions .",
    "these systems have resonances with a finite width , which only vanishes for large dimensions .",
    "when these structures have dimensions of the order of one optical wavelength , the field strength of the mode may become large ( and thereby the coupling constant ) , but at the cost of an increasing loss rate .",
    "systems with exact bound states can exist in so - called photonic materials .",
    "the well known examples are photonic crystals with a point defect @xcite and disordered structures @xcite .",
    "these systems are interesting for cavity qed , because ideally ( no dissipation and infinite size ) the lifetime of the bound state is infinite and propagating modes occur at other frequencies only .",
    "photonic materials are complicated structures , however , so that fabrication and modeling is not easy . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the occurrence of exact @xmath0d - bound states in dielectric structures that are not a photonic crystal .",
    "the system with the simplest design is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this cavity consists of horizontal layers reminiscent of a vcsel , with two crossed vertical planes of a material with lower index of refraction .",
    "the occurrence of bound states relies on the use of dielectric material with particular polarization properties .",
    "as we will show , the structure of fig .  [ fig1 ] is in fact only one in a class of systems with bound modes .",
    "the systems in this class are characterized by the dielectric function @xmath2 with the tensor form @xmath3 +   ( 1-\\hat{z}\\,\\hat{z } ) w(z ) .",
    "\\label{tenschi}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 is the dielectric constant of the ( isotropic ) background medium .",
    "the functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 represent the spatial dependence of the vertical and horizontal layered structures . in the case that the layers have a lower susceptibility than the background ( for instance , when they represent air holes in dielectric material ) , @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 will be negative .",
    "these functions will be specified later . in a dielectric environment of the form ( [ tenschi ] ) , fields with a polarization in the horizontal plane",
    "will only be affected by the structures described by @xmath8 , while vertically polarized fields are only perturbed by the structures described by @xmath9 . moreover , because the structures depend on one or two spatial coordinates only , the propagation of these particular fields in the other directions is free . here",
    "we consider another specific type of polarization , which is governed by all three functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the electric field strength of this type can be expressed as @xmath10 in terms of scalar functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and eigenvalues @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "this is proven by direct substitution into the maxwell equation @xmath16 .",
    "after projecting out the cartesian vector components , one finds that this equation separates into independent equations for the scalar functions : @xmath17 the separation constants @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath14 in these equations , which denote wave vector components , must be related by @xmath20 , with the length of the wave vector given by @xmath21 .",
    "it can now be verified directly , that the field ( [ vece ] ) is transversely polarized in the isotropic background .",
    "note also that components normal to interfaces ( where @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 have steps ) of the electric field @xmath22 , the displacement field @xmath23 and of the magnetic field @xmath24 are all continuous .    that a dielectric structure of form ( [ tenschi ] ) with specific choice of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 can indeed support bound modes now follows from the following general considerations .",
    "solutions that are localized in the @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 direction can be created when @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 is negative .",
    "such solutions represent electromagnetic fields that are guided by vertical structures or a horizontal structure . because eqs .",
    "( [ fx]-[fy ] ) are schrdinger - type equations , it follows from standard wave mechanics that when @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive in a finite region , the prefactor @xmath31 must be positive for such a guided wave . in that case both functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 act as attracting potentials , but only one of the two eigenvalues @xmath28 , @xmath29 is negative .",
    "when , on the other hand , @xmath5 and @xmath6 both become negative , an attractive potential is obtained for negative @xmath34 , so that the sign in front of both functions is reversed . therefore a wave can be localized both in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions simultaneously when @xmath5 and @xmath6 become less than @xmath35 .",
    "( [ ez ] ) , is of the helmholz type , with the effective potential @xmath8 multiplied by the eigenvalue . only when @xmath7 becomes less than @xmath36 , an attractive potential with a localized solution",
    "localized solutions for each of the scalar functions @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 can also be obtained when the corresponding function @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 is periodic in two half spaces .",
    "in that situation the wave function can be a defect state in a band gap .",
    "a fully bound state for the electric field ( [ vece ] ) will occur when all three scalar wave functions are localized simultaneously .",
    "this can be achieved by means of combination of the different localizing effects .",
    "the conclusion of this analysis may be summarized as follows . when the structures described by @xmath5 and @xmath6 have a higher index of refraction than the background , the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive and a @xmath0d bound state requires periodic structures in one of the two horizontal directions and also in the vertical direction , i.e.  the system must be a @xmath40d photonic crystal .",
    "when both @xmath5 and @xmath6 become less than @xmath35 , they describe crossed vertical slabs with a low index , and a @xmath0d bound state is found with a @xmath41d periodic structure of horizontal layers .",
    "when @xmath7 describes a horizontal layer of negative - index material , a @xmath41d photonic crystal of vertical layers is needed for a @xmath0d bound state . because @xmath20 , at least one of the eigenvalues @xmath28 , @xmath29 or @xmath30 must be positive , so that localized solutions are not possible without the use of periodicity in at least one dimension . because the type of systems proposed here is not a @xmath0d photonic crystal , the frequency of a bound state will ly in the continuum of propagating modes .",
    "we will now consider the most interesting situation : the @xmath41d periodic structure illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which has a @xmath0d bound state .",
    "the vertical and horizontal layers have widths @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively and the layer - to - layer separation distance is @xmath44 , so that the fundamental resonant wavelength @xmath45 will lie in the interval between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the anisotropy inside the vertical layers is described with the dielectric tensor @xmath48 , while the tensor @xmath49 describes the horizontal layers .",
    "the ( real part of the ) dielectric constant @xmath50 must be smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "this kind of anisotropy can be obtained by drilling air holes in isotropic high - index material in , respectively , the vertical and horizontal directions .",
    "we will discuss the cavity resonances of this structure and include absorption in the layers by allowing an imaginary component of the dielectric function .",
    "the exact bound states of our system must then arize from the resonances in the limit of zero loss .",
