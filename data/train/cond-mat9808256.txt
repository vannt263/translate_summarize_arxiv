    "understanding reactions on surfaces plays an important role in a wide range of technologically relevant applications . among those are the _ heterogenous catalysis _  the majority of reactions in the chemical industry employ catalysts ; _ crystal growth _ , which determines , e.g. , the quality of semiconductor devices ; _ corrosion _ and _ lubrication _ , which influences the durability of mechanical systems ; or _ hydrogen storage _ in metals , just to mention a few .",
    "the reactions involved in these processes are often too complicated to be studied in detail as a whole . therefore in surface science one tries to understand reaction mechanisms by breaking them up into simpler steps which are then studied under well - defined conditions @xcite .",
    "studies of chemical reaction dynamics are well established in the gas phase .",
    "reactions on surfaces differ from gas - phase reactions in two fundamental aspects : first , the presence of the surface changes the symmetry significantly , and second , the substrate on which the reaction occurs represents in principle a system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom which acts as a heat bath that leads to dissipation and thermal fluctuations . as for the symmetry , while for example for the description of the dissociation of a diatomic molecule in the gas phase only the interatomic distance has to be taken into account ( all other degrees of freedom can be separated ) , in front of a surface all six degrees of freedom of the diatomic molecule have to be considered explicitly since the surface breaks the symmetry with respect to the gas phase . on the other hand ,",
    "a crystalline surface introduces new symmetries , for example the periodicity of the surface .",
    "dissociative adsorption processes are of particular importance for reactions on surfaces since they constitute the first step in heterogenous catalysis ; furthermore they are often the rate - limiting process , for example in ammonia synthesis or co oxidation .",
    "the term `` heterogenous '' refers to the fact that the reactants ( usually a gas ) and the catalyst ( usually a solid substrate ) are not in the same phase state . for the atomic or molecular adsorption process ,",
    "energy dissipation to the substrate is necessary for the particles to be trapped into an adsorption well on the surface , otherwise they would be scattered back into the gas phase . in the case of dissociative adsorption , however , there is another channel for energy transfer , which is the conversion of the kinetic and internal energy of the molecule into translational energy of the atomic fragments on the surface relative to each other . in addition , for light molecules like hydrogen there is usually only a small energy transfer to substrate phonons due to the large mass mismatch between the molecule and the substrate atoms . if furthermore no substantial surface rearrangement upon adsorption occurs  which is often fulfilled for densely packed metal surfaces",
    " then the dissociative adsorption dynamics can be described using low - dimensional potential energy surfaces ( pes ) .",
    "still the interaction of a diatomic molecule with a well - defined fixed substrate involves the six degrees of freedom of the molecule . up to recently the interaction dynamics in particular of hydrogen",
    "had been described in low - dimensional quantum studies @xcite ; higher - dimensional studies could only be performed by classical trajectory calculations @xcite or mixed quantum - classical methods @xcite on model potentials .",
    "this was due to the lack of reliable potential energy surfaces and the large computational effort for high - dimensional quantum dynamics studies ( for reviews on these dynamical studies see , e.g. , refs .",
    "this situation has changed significantly within the last five years caused by the development of efficient algorithms and the increase in computer power . for the paradigm of simple reactions on surfaces  the dissociation of hydrogen on metal surfaces  detailed potential energy surfaces obtained by density functional theory calculations are now available @xcite .",
    "this has increased the motivation to perform dynamical studies in which all hydrogen degrees of freedom are treated explicitly , and indeed the first six - dimensional quantum dynamical studies of hydrogen dissociation on metal surfaces have now been performed @xcite .    in this review",
    "i will give a overview of this rather new field of _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations of reactions on surfaces .",
    "usually these calculations require three independent steps : +    1 .",
    "determination of the _ ab initio",
    "_ pes by first - principles total - energy calculations , 2 .",
    "a fit of the total energies to an analytical or numerical continuous representation which serves as an interpolation between the actually calculated points , 3 .   a dynamical calculation on this representation of the _ ab initio _ pes that includes all relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "+    since this type of calculations is indeed derived from first principles with no adjustable parameters , i will refer to them as `` _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations '' .",
    "however , this term should not conceal the still approximative nature of these dynamics simulations .",
    "in all three steps approximations are involved which will be discussed in this review .",
    "for example , exchange and correlation effects of the electrons can not be treated exactly in total - energy calculations using density functional theory .",
    "the description of the surface by either a supercell or a cluster method is an approximation .",
    "furthermore , the fitting of the _ ab initio _ energies to a continuous representation is a highly non - trivial task .",
    "if just classical trajectories are determined , quantum effects in the motion of the nuclei are neglected which can be important , in particular for the dynamics of hydrogen . and also the question , what are the relevant degrees of freedom in the dissociation process , can not be answered unambiguously and depends , for example , on the properties that one is interested in . hence in this review also",
    "investigations , in which not all molecular degrees of freedom are treated explicitly , but which are still derived from first principles , are included .    for classical _ ab initio _ dynamics simulations , which will in the following be referred to by the term `` _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics '' ,",
    "the three steps mentioned above can actually be combined since most first - principles total - energy schemes also determine the gradients of the potential via the hellmann - feynman theorem @xcite .",
    "thus the classical equations of motion can be directly solved .",
    "for each step of the numerical integration of the equations of motion the forces are determined by a new total - energy calculation .",
    "since this is rather time - consuming , only a small number ( @xmath0 ) of trajectories can be calculated in this way .",
    "therefore this method does not allow the determination of reaction probabilities which usually require at least thousands of trajectories due to the statistical nature of the reactive events @xcite",
    ".    on the other hand , _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations with the determination of the forces `` on the fly '' do not require any fitting .",
    "this makes them very flexible . on semiconductor surfaces , the substrate rearrangement upon adsorption",
    "can not be neglected ; indeed it plays a crucial role for the adsorption and desorption mechanism @xcite .",
    "an analytical fit of an _ ab initio _ pes including several substrate degrees of freedom has not been performed yet because of its complexity .",
    "therefore , for the investigation of the dissociative adsorption and associative desorption process on semiconductor surfaces the `` traditional '' _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics method with the determination of the forces `` on the fly '' has still been used @xcite .",
    "its application is reasonable if the information obtained from a small number of trajectories is sufficient to gain insight into a particular process .    high - dimensional _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations will not make low - dimensional simulations on model potentials obsolete .",
    "these model calculations have provided us with the framework to interprete the dynamics .",
    "high - dimensional dynamics is often too complicated to be followed in detail .",
    "but this review will show that high - dimensional _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations have advanced our understanding of the dissociation dynamics tremendously and sometimes even caused the modification of established concepts .",
    "first of all , the _ ab initio _ calculation of potential energy surfaces has confronted the gas - surface dynamics community with some features of these pess which had not been expected and which challenged new interpretations and calculations . and secondly , some phenomema in the reaction dynamics on surfaces only occur in simulations if a sufficiently large number of degrees of freedom is included .",
    "thus high - dimensional simulations not only lead to progress in the quantitative , but also in the qualitative understanding of processes on surfaces .",
    "in particular for the hydrogen dissociation on transition metals surfaces _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations have proven their power .",
    "they demonstrated , e.g. , that the initial decrease of the sticking probability with kinetic energy often found experimentally in these systems is not due to a precursor mechanism , as was the common believe , but is caused by an hitherto underestimated dynamical mechanism , namely the steering effect @xcite .",
    "this review is devoted to a large part to the dissociation of hydrogen on surfaces . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", hydrogen is the simplest molecule .",
    "this does not neccessarily keep the computational effort small , but it makes the theoretical description controllable . from the experimental point of view , hydrogen molecules can be used without severe problems in molecular beam apparatuses , and they can be detected state - specifically by laser techniques .",
    "therefore hydrogen is the ideal candidate for a close collaboration between theory and experiment in order to explore the dynamics of the dissociation process on surfaces .",
    "the general concepts found in these studies will also be applicable to heavier and more complicated molecules .",
    "due to its light mass , the study of the hydrogen dissociation dynamics also allows to address some fundamental concepts in physics like the importance of quantum effects .",
    "still the hydrogen interaction with surface is technologically relevant , for example in the passivation or growth of semiconductor devices .",
    "all these facts make the study of the hydrogen dissociation dynamics on surfaces an exciting research subject .    the electronically adiabatic _ ab initio _ dynamics of adsorption and desorption has recently been reviewed from a more quantum chemical point of view @xcite . in the meantime , an _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics study of the reaction of hydrogen _ atoms _ with a hydrogen - passivated semiconductor surface has been performed @xcite in which pick up reactions of the eley - rideal type were studied .",
    "furthermore , detailed _ ab initio _ pes studies of reactions on surfaces involving heavier molecules like o@xmath1 @xcite or co@xmath1 @xcite have been performed , and probably soon dynamics calculations using these _ ab initio _ potentials will be carried out . even the laser - induced desorption which involves electronically excited states has currently been addressed from first principles , namely the laser - induced desorption of no form nio(100 ) @xcite , which will also be briefly reviewed at the end of this article .",
    "this short collection shows that _ ab initio _ dynamics studies of reactions on surface is a very active and growing field .    after this introduction , in the next section the theoretical concepts necessary in order to perform _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations are briefly introduced .",
    "then the hydrogen dissociation on metal surfaces is addressed , first on simple and noble metals where the dissociation is usually hindered by a substantial barrier , and then on transition metals which often have non - activated pathways to dissociative adsorption . in this context also the poisoning of the dissociation by an adsorbate is discussed .",
    "the interaction of hydrogen with semiconductor surfaces is treated in the following section .",
    "then the first _ ab initio _ dynamics calculation involving electronically excited states is discussed .",
    "the review ends with an outlook and some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section the theoretical methods to describe the molecule - surface interaction are briefly described .",
    "it is not intended to give a complete overview .",
    "i will rather introduce the main concepts and shortly comment on them .",
    "the schrdinger equation describing the interaction of molecules with surfaces has the general form @xmath2 in this equation @xmath3 are the ionic coordinates and @xmath4 the electronic coordinates .",
    "it is well - known that a complete analytical solution of the schrdinger equation taking into account both ionic and electronic degrees of freedom is not possible except for simple cases .",
    "one common approach is to assume that  due to the large mass difference between electrons and the nuclei ",
    "the electrons follow the motion of the nuclei adiabatically .",
    "this is the famous born - oppenheimer approximation @xcite . and",
    "since it is only an approximation , its validity has to be checked carefully .    in gas - surface scattering electronically non - adiabatic processes are indeed occuring .",
    "they are directly observable as chemiluminescence and exo - electron emission ( see , e.g. , the recent review of t. greber @xcite ) . however , the proper treatment of electronically non - adiababic effects in gas - surface dynamics is rather complex . one problem that goes with the complexity of the non - adiabaticity is that it is not easy to judge whether the dynamics in any particular system is indeed electronically adiabatic or not .",
    "the usual argument for the validity of the born - oppenheimer approximation is the smallness of the atomic velocities as compared to the electronic velocities . if in addition the adiabatic energy levels are well - separated , electronic transitions are negligible ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for metals",
    "the situation is more complicated due to the quasi - continuum of electronic states .",
    "since the effective potentials and the coupling between the electronic states can still not be computed rigorously , one is left with more or less hand - waving arguments . among them",
    "are the following : ( i ) at metal surfaces electronic excitations are very short - lived . hence electronic excitations are effectively quenched .",
    "( ii ) molecular electronic levels become rather broad upon the interaction with surfaces .",
    "broad levels correspond to short lifetimes of excited states and again , this leads to an effective quenching of electronic excitations .    on semiconductor and insulator surfaces",
    "the situation is different due to the band gap which makes the treatment of electronically excited states more tractable . at the end of this review",
    "i will present the first description of electronically non - adiabatic processes in molecular desorption from oxide surfaces on an _ ab initio _ basis . for metal surfaces ,",
    "where no band gap exists , a more practical approach has still to be applied which is just to perform electronically adiabatic dynamical studies of reactions on surfaces as well and detailed as possible and to compare the results of these high - quality calculations with experiment .",
    "as long as the consequences of these simulations are in agreement with experiment , there is apparently no need for the involvement of electronic excitations in the described processes . for the time being , we just follow this practical approach and assume that the born - oppenheimer approximation is justified .",
    "we can then write down the electronic hamiltonian in which the coordinates of the nuclei just enter as parameters .",
    "this hamiltonian has the form @xmath5 the many - electron ground state energy @xmath6 then defines the potential for the motion of the nuclei .",
    "once it is obtained , it can be plugged into the schrdinger equation for the nuclei , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is now the energy relevant for the dynamics of the nuclei , or , alternatively , it can be used to solve the classical equations of motion , @xmath9 for extended systems the most efficient approach to determine the many - electron ground state energy @xmath6 from first principles is density functional theory @xcite in combination with the supercell concept . in this approach the surface is modelled by a periodic array of slabs separated by vacuum regions , and the wave functions are expanded in a suitable basis which is often based on plane waves or augmented plane waves .",
    "almost all of the _ ab initio _",
    "potentials discussed later in this review are determined in this way , but real - space @xcite and green function methods @xcite have been proposed as well . and",
    "also quantum chemical methods are used in which the infinite substrate is modelled by a finite cluster ( see , e.g. , the recent review of whitten and yang @xcite ) . _ ab initio _ total energy calculations are briefly discussed in the next section .      in this review i will focus on the _ reaction dynamics on _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces _ , not on the determination of the pess .",
    "still i will introduce some basics about density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "for further details i refer to more extensive treatments like , e.g. , refs .",
    "dft is based upon the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite which states that the ground - state total energy of a system of interacting electrons @xmath10 can be obtained by minimizing an energy functional @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 \\ = \\ \\min ( t[n ] \\ + \\",

    "the electron density @xmath16 which minimizes the total energy can be found by solving self - consistently the kohn - sham equations @xcite @xmath17 \\psi_i ( { \\bf r } ) \\                        = \\",
    "\\varepsilon_i \\psi_i ( { \\bf r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the single - particle kinetic energy operator and @xmath19 the electrostatic potential .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential @xmath20 is the functional derivative of the exchange - correlation functional @xmath21 $ ] @xmath22}{\\delta n}.\\ ] ] the exchange - correlation functional @xmath21 $ ] can be written as @xmath23 \\ = \\",
    "\\int d^3{\\bf r } \\",
    "n({\\bf r } )   \\",
    "\\epsilon^{\\rm xc}[n]({\\bf r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath24 $ ] is the exchange - correlation energy per particle .",
    "this exchange - correlation energy is not known exactly except for some special cases like constant electron density . in a wide range of bulk and",
    "surface problems the so - called local density approximation ( lda ) , in which @xmath24 $ ] is replaced by the exchange - correlation energy for the homogeneous electron gas , has been surprisingly successful @xcite . for dissociation barriers on surfaces , however , lda is seriously in error . in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) also the gradient of the density is included in the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "different forms for the gga functional have been proposed ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the use of gga functionals leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculated barrier heights @xcite .",
    "still the validity of the gga is strongly debated , in particular in the h@xmath1/si(100 ) system @xcite .",
    "the problem in the development of more accurate exchange - correlation functionals is that they still represent in principle an uncontrolled approximation , i.e. , there is no systematic way of improving the functionals since there is no expansion in some controllable parameter ( it should be noted here that even if an expansion in some controllable parameter exists , this expansion can still be problematic ) . basically the success justifies the choice of some particular functional .",
    "hence dynamical simulations on _ ab initio _ potentials also serve the purpose to check the accuracy of the chosen exchange - correlation functional .",
    "the supercell approach allows to transfer dft algorithms , that have been very successfully applied to the determination of bulk properties , to the description of surface problems .",
    "especially the seminal paper by car and parrinello @xcite has drawn a lot of attention . due to the variational principle of density functional theory",
    "the determination of the electronic ground state can be regarded as a global optimization scheme thus avoiding the explicit diagonalization of huge matrices .",
    "such an approach was first proposed by bendt and zunger @xcite .",
    "car and parrinello demonstrated how powerful this method can be by combining dft and molecular dynamics .    in the quantum chemical approach",
    "the infinite substrate is represented by a finite cluster .",
    "dft methods have also been used to determine the total energies of the cluster @xcite , but traditionally quantum chemical methods based on the wave function dominate , i.e. hartree - fock methods without or with the inclusion of the configuration interaction ( ci ) . while supercell calculations often describe",
    "relatively high - coverage situations due to the repeated surface unit cell , cluster methods represent low - coverage situations .",
    "however , they suffer from the fact that the infinite substrate is often not appropriately modelled by a small cluster and that the total energies are often not converged as a function of the cluster size @xcite .",
    "for the treatment of electronic excitations , dft methods could in principle also be used because due to the hohenberg - kohn theorem the electronic ground state density uniquely defines the external potential @xcite and thereby also all electronically excited states . however , in practice dft methods usually only determine the total energy for the electronic ground state of a certain configuration ( there are exceptions , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to describe electronically excited states wave - function based methods are still unavoidable which necessitates the use of a finite cluster that can , however , be embedded for example in a field of point charges @xcite .",
    "one serious problem arises for the use of _ ab initio _ potential energies in particular in quantum dynamics simulations . to solve the schrdinger equation",
    ", one needs in general a continuous description of the potential since the wave functions are delocalized .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations , however , just provide total energies for discrete configurations of the nuclei . in order to obtain a continuous description , the _ ab initio _ energies have to be fitted to an analytical or numerical continuous representation of the potential energy surface .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial task .",
    "on the one hand the representation should be flexible enough to accurately reproduce the _ ab initio _",
    "input data , on the other hand it should have a limited number of parameters so that it is still controllable .",
    "ideally a good parametrisation should not only accurately interpolate between the actually calculated points , but it should also give a reliable extrapolation to regions of the potential energy surface that have actually not been determined by the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the explicit form of the chosen analytical or numerical representation of the _ ab initio _ potential varies from application to application .",
    "often the choice is dictated by the dynamics algorithm in which the representation is used .",
    "the applications have almost entirely been devoted to the interaction of a diatomic molecule with the surface .",
    "the angular orientation of the molecule has usually been expanded in spherical harmonics and the center - of - mass coordinates parallel to the surface in a fourier series @xcite . for the pes in the plane of the molecular distance from the surface and the interatomic separation",
    "a representation in reaction path coordinate has been employed @xcite , but also two - body potentials have been used @xcite . before detailed _ ab initio _",
    "potentials became available , the leps form was often used to construct a global pes @xcite .",
    "this parametrization contains only a small number of adjustable parameters which made it so attractive for model calculations , but which makes it at the same time relatively unflexible .",
    "a modified leps potential has still been successfully used to fit an _ ab initio _ pes of the interaction of atomic hydrogen with the the hydrogenated si(100 ) surface @xcite .    as an alternative approach to fit _",
    "ab initio _ energies , a genetic programming scheme has recently been proposed , in which both the best functional form and the best set of parameters are searched for @xcite .",
    "this method has so far only been used for three - dimensional potentials so that its capability still has to be proven for higher - dimensional problems .    _",
    "ab initio _ total energies are often mainly determined at high - symmetry points of the surface in order to reduce the computational cost .",
    "it is true that these high - symmetry points usually reflect the extrema in the pes .",
    "however , due to this limitation the fitted continuous pes can only contain terms that correspond to these high - symmetry situations .",
    "on the one hand this often saves computer time also in the quantum dynamics because certain additional selection rules are introduced which reduces the necessary basis set @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , of course this represents an approximation .",
    "the question , how serious the neglect of terms with lower symmetry is , remains open until these terms have been determined and included in actual dynamical calculations .    if more than just the molecular degrees of freedom should be considered in a parametrization of an _ ab initio _ pes , analytical forms become very complicated and cumbersome . as an alternative , the interpolation of _ ab initio _",
    "points by a neural network has been proposed @xcite .",
    "neural networks can fit , in principle , any real - valued , continuous function to any desired accuracy .",
    "they require no assumptions of the functional form of the underlying problem . on the other hand",
    ", there is no physical insight that is used as an input in this parametrization .",
    "hence the parameters of the neural network do not reflect any physical or chemical property .",
    "another approach is to fit the parameters of a tight - binding formalism to _ ab initio _",
    "energies @xcite .",
    "a tight - binding method is more time - consuming than an analytical representation or a neural network since it requires the diagonalization of a matrix .",
    "however , due to the fact that the quantum mechanical nature of bonding is taken into account @xcite tight - binding schemes need a smaller number of _ ab initio _ input points to perform a good interpolation _ and _ extrapolation @xcite .",
    "in addition , their parameters , the slater - koster integrals @xcite , have a physical meaning .",
    "it remains to be seen how useful the different fitting methods will be for performing _",
    "ab initio _ dynamics simulations .",
    "it has been argued that any fitting scheme using analytic potential functions introduces a possible bias into the parametrization @xcite . in order to avoid",
    "this one should use _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics methods that calculate the forces `` on the fly '' because this requires no fitting .",
    "however , approaching a problem apparently unbiased also means not to take advantage of any previous knowledge . on the contrary , using as much experience and knowledge as possible should usually make any method more efficient @xcite .",
    "an important issue is to judge the quality of the fit to an _ ab initio _ pes .",
    "usually the root mean squared ( rms ) error between fit and input data is used as a measure of the quality of a fit .",
    "if this error is zero , then everything is fine .",
    "however , normally this error is larger than zero .",
    "the systematic error of the _ ab initio _ energies is usually estimated to be of the order of 0.1  ev .",
    "often it is said that the rms error of the fit should be of the same order .",
    "but the dynamics of molecular dissociation at surfaces can be dramatically different depending on whether there is a barrier for dissociation of height 0.1  ev or not @xcite .",
    "hence for certain regions of the pes the error has to be much less than 0.1  ev , while for other regions even an error of 0.5  ev might not influence the dynamics significantly .",
    "another example occurs in a reaction path parametrization .",
    "if the curvature in the parametrization is off by a few percent , the energetic distribution of barrier heights is not changed and the dynamical properties are usually not altered significantly .",
    "however , the location of the barriers is changed and consequently the rms error can become rather large . hence one has to be cautious by just using the rms error as a quality check of the fit .",
    "unfortunately there is no other simple error function for the assessment of the quality of a fit .",
    "if it is possible , one should perform a dynamical check . obviously , if the dynamical properties calculated on a fitted pes agree with the ones calculated on the original pes , the quality of the fit should be sufficient .",
    "there are two ways to determine quantum mechanical reaction probabilities : by solving the time - dependent or the time - independent schrdinger equation . both approaches",
    "are equivalent @xcite and should give the same results .",
    "the chosen method depends on its applicability , but apparently it is often also a matter of training and personal taste .    in the most common time - independent formulation ,",
    "the concept of defining one specific reaction path coordinate is crucial .",
    "starting from the schrdinger equation @xmath25 one chooses one specific reaction path coordinate @xmath26 and separates the kinetic energy operator in this coordinate @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the original hamiltonian except for the kinetic energy operator in the reaction path coordinate .",
    "usually the use of curvelinear reaction path coordinates results in a more complicated expression for the kinetic energy operator involving cross terms @xcite , but for the sake of clarity i have neglected this in eq .",
    "[ reacham ] .",
    "as the next step one expands the wave function in the coordinates perpendicular to the reaction path coordinate in some suitable set of basis functions , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a multi - index , and the expansion coefficients @xmath31 are assumed to be a function of the reaction path coordinate .",
    "now we insert the expansion of @xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ reacham ] and multiply the schrdinger equation by @xmath33 , which corresponds to performing a multi - dimensional integral . since the basis functions @xmath34 are assumed to be independent of @xmath26 , we end up with the so - called coupled - channel equations , @xmath35 instead of a partial differential equation  the original time - independent schrdinger equation eq .",
    "[ tise ]  we now have a set of coupled ordinary differential equation .",
    "still a straightforward numerical integration of the coupled - channel equations leads to instabilities , except for in simple cases , due to exponentially increasing so - called closed channels .",
    "recently a very stable and efficient coupled - channel algorithm has been introduced @xcite . the main idea underlying this particular algorithm",
    "will be briefly sketched in the following .",
    "for the solution @xmath32 defined in eq .",
    "[ expa ] , which represents a vector in the space of the basis functions , the initial conditions are not specified .",
    "this function can also be considered as a matrix @xmath36 where the index  @xmath37 labels a solution of the schrdinger equation with an incident plane wave of amplitude one in channel  @xmath37 and zero in all other channels .",
    "formally one can then write the solution of the schrdinger equation for a scattering problem in a matrix notation as @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the reflection and transmission matrix , respectively .",
    "now one makes the following ansatz for the wave function , @xmath42 equation  [ li ] defines the _ local reflection matrix _",
    "@xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and the _ inverse local transmission matrix _  @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the boundary values for these matrices are ( except for phase factors which , however , do not affect the transition probabilities ) : @xmath47 from the schrdinger equation first order differential equations for both matrices can be derived @xcite which can be solved by starting from the known initial values at @xmath48 ; at @xmath49 one then obtains the physical reflection and transmission matrices .",
    "thus the numerically unstable boundary value problem has been transformed to a stable initial value problem .    in the time - dependent or wave - packet formulation ,",
    "the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath50 can formally be written as @xmath51 if the potential is time - independent .",
    "the most common methods to represent the time - evolution operator @xmath52 in the gas - surface dynamics community are the split - operator @xcite and the chebychev @xcite methods . in the split - operator method ,",
    "the time - evolution operator for small time steps @xmath53 is written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath56 the potential term . in the chebyshev method ,",
    "the time - evolution operator is expanded as @xmath57 where the @xmath58 are chebyshev polynomials and @xmath59 is the hamiltonian rescaled to have eigenvalues in the .",
    "both propagation schemes use the fact that the kinetic energy operator is diagonal in @xmath60-space and the potential in real - space . the wave function and the potential",
    "are represented on a numerical grid , and the switching between the @xmath60-space and real - space representations is efficiently done by fast fourier transformations ( fft ) @xcite .    in the last years",
    "the time - dependent wave - packet methods have been much more fashionable than time - independent schemes in the gas - surface dynamics community .",
    "many different groups have used wave - packet codes to study the dissociation dynamics on surfaces , up to recently almost entirely on low - dimensional model potentials @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that wave - packet methods avoid `` the problem of excessively many channels '' @xcite .",
    "but actually these methods suffer from the fact that the wave function and the potential are represented on a grid which leads to memory problems in the implementation . in each dimension between 16 and several hundred",
    "grid - points are used . in time - independent methods , on the contrary , it is for example sufficient to expand the hydrogen wave function in the interatomic distance in three or four eigenfunctions of a harmonic oscillator due to the large vibrational energy quantum .",
    "one might say that the hydrogen vibration in time - independent methods is represented by three or four points instead of more than sixteen in time - dependent methods .",
    "in addition , while in the @xmath61 scheme @xcite the matrices are successively determined along the reaction path and do not have to be stored , in wave - packet methods the wave function has always to be stored everywhere on the grid .",
    "the saving in storage requirements is one of the reasons that the first six - dimensional quantum dynamical treatment of hydrogen dissociation on surfaces was indeed a time - independent one using the @xmath61 scheme @xcite .",
    "once an analytical continuous representation of an _ ab initio _ pes is available , it is also possible to determine the gradients of the potential analytically .",
    "this allows one to perform _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics studies by integrating the classical equations of motion , @xmath62 the solution of the equations of motion can be obtained by standard numerical integration schemes like runge - kutta , burlisch - stoer or predictor - corrector methods ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "sticking corresponds to a process in which statistically distributed particles hit the surface .",
    "this means that the determination of classical sticking probabilities requires an average over typically thousands of trajectories .",

    "most _ ab initio _ total - energy programmes based on plane - wave expansions also evaluate the gradients of the potential via the hellmann - feynman theorem@xcite . with these forces the classical equations of motion can directly be solved .",
    "this `` traditional '' _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics scheme with the determination of the forces on the fly has the advantage that it does not require the fitting of the _ ab initio _ pes to any analytical or numerical representation .",
    "this is especially advantageous if surface degrees of freedom play an important role in the dissociation process . on the other hand",
    ", every step of the numerical integration of the equations of motion requires a new _ ab initio _ total - energy calculation which is still rather time - consuming . hence the number of trajectories obtainable in such a `` during the journey '' _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulation is limited to numbers well below 100 @xcite .",
    "such a simulation only makes sense if one can extract meaningful information from a low number of events . for the simulation of adsorption events",
    "this is usually not the case , but for desorption , where the particles originate from a small portion of the phase space , `` on the fly '' _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations can still be useful @xcite .",
    "but even if an analytical representation of the _ ab initio _ pes is available , there is still some computational effort to determine dissociation probabilities .",
    "it is a wide - spread believe that classical dynamical methods are much less time - consuming than quantum ones .",
    "this is certainly true if one compares the computational cost of one trajectory to a quantum calculation .",
    "the quantum calculations , however , take advantage of the delocalized nature of the wave functions .",
    "a beam of particles approaching the surface is described by a plane wave in the gas phase that includes all impact points . and a non - rotating molecule is represented by an @xmath63 rotational state , where @xmath64 is the rotational quantum number and which contains all orientations with equal probability .",
    "hence the averaging over initial conditions is done automatically in quantum mechanics .",
    "consequently , quantum dynamical simulations do not necessarily have to be more time - consuming that classical calculations , in particular if one considers the fact that in wave - packet calculations the dissociation probability for a whole range of energies is calculated in one run or that in a time - independent coupled - channel method the sticking and scattering probabilites of all open channels are determined simultaneously .",
    "the crucial difference between quantum and classical dynamics is that in the quantum dynamics the averaging is done coherently while it is done incoherently in the classical dynamics . for heavier molecules",
    "this is apparently not important , but for hydrogen dissociation this has important consequences , as will be shown below .",
    "after introducing the theoretical concepts necessary to perform _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations , i will now discuss applications .",
    "i start with the hydrogen dissociation on metal surfaces .",
    "while the dissociation of hydrogen at simple or noble metals is usually hindered by a substantial energy barrier , transition metal surfaces are rather reactive , i.e. , already at low kinetic energies the dissociative adsorption probability is often larger than 10 per cent .",
    "this reactivity has been attributed to the local density of states ( ldos ) of the partly filled @xmath65-band at the fermi level @xcite or close to the fermi level @xcite of the transition metals .",
    "recent investigations have shown that the reactivity can not be solely understood in terms of the ldos at the fermi level , but rather by the hybridization between molecular and metal states which involves the whole @xmath65-band @xcite .    in noble metals",
    "the @xmath65-band is filled , which leads to the existence of a significant barrier towards dissociative adsorption of hydrogen .",
    "first i will discuss the _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations for such an activated system , namely h@xmath1/cu which has been the benchmark system for the study of dissociative adsorption .",

    "hence there are only small directional forces , and molecules adsorbed in such a physisorption state are able to rotate almost freely @xcite . the trapping probability into the physisorption state and thus the sticking probability in the precursor model should therefore be almost independent of the initial rotational state , in contrast to the steering mechanism . in another series of experiments",

    "klner and coworkers have performed configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations for the construction of potential energy surfaces for electronically excited states describing the laser - induced desorption of no from nio(100 ) @xcite . in the ci calculations a nio@xmath111 cluster was embedded in a semi - infinite madelung potential of @xmath1122 point charges for the simulation of the nio(100 ) surface .",
    "the calculated ground state potential did in fact not reproduce the experimentally found binding energy of 0.52  ev @xcite , confirming the well - known problems in determining binding energies at surfaces by cluster calculations @xcite .",
    "the _ ab initio _ minimum has therefore been scaled to fit the experimental data @xcite . one specific charge transfer state in which one electron was transferred from the cluster to the no molecule was used as a representative electronically excited state .",
    "the potential energy surfaces were determined as a function of the no center of mass distance from the surface and the polar orientation of the molecule with respect to the surface normal .",
    "figure  [ nonio_pes ] shows the excited state potential .",
    "( 10,6.0 ) ( -2.,-10.)=12.5 cm    the dynamics of the laser - induced desorption of no from nio(100 ) were simulated by the jumping wave packet method in which the molecular distance from the surface and the polar and azimuthal orientation of the molecule were considered explicitly .",
    "the laser - induced electronic excitation was modelled by putting the three - dimensional ground state wave function of the electronic ground state onto the electronically excited pes .",
    "thereby the center of the wave function is located at the franck - condon point fc shown on fig .",
    "[ nonio_pes ] .",
    "the minimum of the excited state potential is closer to the surface than in the ground state potential leading to an acceleration of the wave packet towards the surface .",
    "this is called an antoniewicz desorption scenario @xcite .",
    "the wave packet is then propagated for a certain residence time on the excited state potential before it is transferred in a second franck - condon transition back to the electronic ground state .",
    "molecules that have gained enough kinetic energy after the franck - condon transitions are able to desorb .",
    "the finite residence time is due to the interaction of the excited state with the electronic spectrum of the substrate .",
    "the coupling strength of this interaction that causes the quenching of the electronic excitation is still unknown .",
    "hence the mean residence time , the so - called _ resonance _ time @xmath113 , enters as an adjustable parameter in the dynamics simulation .",
    "a value of @xmath114  fs has been chosen which yields a desorption probability of 3.3% in agreement with typical experimental data @xcite .    since the wave packet calculation",
    "are performed within a restricted dimensionality , quantitative agreement with the experiment @xcite can not be the ultimate goal of this theoretical study .",
    "more important is to gain a qualitative understanding of experimental trends . and",
    "indeed this study provides such a qualitative concept .",
    "the excited state potential has a complicated shape as a function of the polar orientation of the molecule .",
    "two possible pathways are sketched in fig .",
    "[ nonio_pes ] along which partial wave packets can propagate .",
    "this bifurcation of the wave packet causes a bimodality in the calculated velocity distribution of desorbing molecules .",
    "this bimodality has also been found in the experiment @xcite .",
    "hence the _ ab initio _ treatment of the laser - induced desorption relates qualitative trends in the experimental results to microscopic details of the potential energy surfaces .",
    "in this review _ ab initio _ dynamics studies of reactions on surfaces have been presented . in the last years",
    "the interaction between electronic structure calculations on the one side and dynamical calculations on the other side has been very fruitful . the availability of high - dimensional reliable potential energy surfaces has challenged the dynamics community to improve their methods in order to perform high - dimensional dynamical studies on these potentials .",
    "now quantum studies of the dissociation of hydrogen on surfaces are possible in which all six degrees of freedom of the molecule are treated dynamically . in this review",
    "i have tried to show that this achievement represents an important step forward in our understanding of the interaction of molecules with surfaces .",
    "not only the quantitative agreement with experiment is improved , but also important qualitative concepts emerge from these high - dimensional calculations .",
    "however , what are the next steps to be taken in the application of _ ab initio _ dynamics studies ?",
    "the six - dimensional dynamical treatment of hydrogen dissociation represents the achievement of a goal that has long been pursued .",
    "but due to the unfavorable scaling of the quantum dynamical methods with the number of channels there will probably be no seven- or eight - dimensional quantum calculations in the near future ( although there are nevertheless some promising approaches @xcite ) .",
    "neither will there soon be a six - dimensional quantum treatment of molecules heavier than hydrogen for the same reason .",
    "but for these heavier molecules quantum effects are not so important so that a classical treatment of the dynamics will be sufficient .    the important class of oxidation reactions",
    ", for example , will certainly soon be the subject of _ ab initio _ studies in which the dynamics is treated classically .",
    "in _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulation also the energy transfer to substrate phonons can be taken into account by explicitly including the upper layers of the surface in the trajectory calculations .",
    "still the quantum treatment of dissipation is an important goal because it would allow the energy transfer to phonons and to electron - hole pairs to be treated on an equal footing .",
    "this issue leads over to the treatment of electronically non - adiabatic processes . in this important field",
    "both the determination of excited state potentials as well as the description of non - adiabatic dynamics still represent a great challenge where much progress has to be made .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that there is still room for low - dimensional model studies . in order to find out how the reaction dynamics depends on specific details of the pes",
    "it is usually very instructive to perform dynamical simulations in which certain features of the pes are changed in a controlled fashion within a restricted dimensionality .",
    "however , without any _ ab initio _ calculations it is often impossible to even guess the general shape of the pes for a more complicated reaction .",
    "this confirms the important role that _ ab initio _ dynamics calculations play for the advancement of our understanding of reactions on surfaces , even for model studies .",
    "i am very grateful to all my collegues and coworkers who have contributed to the results presented in this review .",
    "i would like to mention michel bockstedte , thomas brunner , bjrk  hammer , peter  kratzer , eckhard  pehlke , ralf  russ , ching - ming wei , steffen  wilke , and my supervisors helmar teichler , wilhelm brenig and matthias scheffler . in particular , without the discussions and the close ongoing collaboration with wilhelm brenig and matthias scheffler this work would have been impossible .",
    "i would also like to thank them and peter kratzer and paolo ruggerone for their critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "special thanks go to peter kratzer and thorsten klner for sharing their results with me prior to publication .",

    "<S> due to the development of efficient algorithms and the improvement of computer power it is now possible to map out potential energy surfaces ( pes ) of reactions at surfaces in great detail . </S>",
    "<S> this achievement has been accompanied by an increased effort in the dynamical simulation of processes on surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the paradigm for simple reactions at surfaces  the dissociation of hydrogen on metal surfaces  can now be treated fully quantum dynamically in the molecular degrees of freedom from first principles , i.e. , without invoking any adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this relatively new field of _ ab initio _ dynamics simulations of reactions at surfaces will be reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> mainly the dissociation of hydrogen on clean and adsorbate covered metal surfaces and on semiconductor surfaces will be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics treatment of reactions of hydrogen _ atoms _ with hydrogen - passivated semiconductor surfaces and recent achievements in the _ ab initio _ description of laser - induced desorption and further developments will be addressed .    </S>",
