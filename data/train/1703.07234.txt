    "the aim of this paper is to characterize a probabilistic convergence of diffusion processes in terms of a geometric convergence of the underlying spaces . as main results ,",
    "we show that the measured gromov convergence of the underlying spaces implies ( or under some condition , is equivalent to ) the weak convergence of brownian motions under riemannian curvature - dimension ( rcd ) conditions .",
    "the rcd conditions are generalization of lower ricci curvature bounds and admits various finite- and infinite - dimensional non - smooth spaces .",
    "these spaces typically appear as gromov - hausdorff ( gh ) limit spaces of riemannian manifolds whose ricci curvatures are uniformly bounded from below .",
    "such spaces may have singularities and are generally no more manifolds ( in fact , we admit dense singularities in example [ exa : dens ] ) . furthermore the rcd framework includes infinite - dimensional spaces such as hilbert spaces with log - concave measures ( related to various stochastic partial differential equations ) ( see further in section [ sec : exa ] ) . a natural question in probability theory",
    "is whether one can construct a brownian motion on these non - smooth spaces , and if one can construct it , what properties it has . by recent developments of analysis on metric measure spaces",
    ", we can construct brownian motions on rcd spaces by using a certain quadratic form , what is called _",
    "cheeger energy_. this is a generalization of dirichlet energy on smooth manifolds and induces a quasi - regular strongly local conservative symmetric dirichlet form ( ambrosio - gigli - savar @xcite ) , which is determined only by the underlying metric measure structure .",
    "one of the important problems for brownian motions on these non - smooth spaces is to characterize the weak convergence of brownian motions in terms of some geometrical convergence of the underlying spaces , which we call the _ stability _ of brownian motions .",
    "one motivating example is : let a sequence of riemannian manifolds ( with lower ricci curvature bounds ) converge to a ( possibly non - smooth ) metric measure space in the gromov ",
    "hausdorff ( gh ) sense .",
    "if so , the question is whether a sequence of brownian motions also converge weakly to the brownian motion ( if it exists ) on the gh - limit space , or not .",
    "the significance of the stability can be explained from several different perspectives . from the standpoint of limit theorems of stochastic processes",
    ", the stability is interpreted as a geometric characterization of invariance principles for brownian motions in the sense that brownian motions on limit spaces are approximated by brownian motions on converging spaces . from the viewpoint of  well - definedness \" , the stability also enables us to verfy that brownian motions in limit spaces are  well - defined \" in the sense that brownian motions intrinsically defined by cheeger energies on limit spaces coincide with limit processes of brownian motions on approximating spaces . from the perspective that brownian motions are considered as  a map \" assigning laws of diffusions ( i.e. , probability measures on path spaces ) to each metric measure space , the stability reveals the interesting fact that this map is continuous with respect to the corresponding topologies ( e.g. , gh - topology of metric measure spaces / weak topology of probability measures on path spaces ) , which is one ideal aspect of brownian motions but has not been focused on so much until now .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to prove the stability of brownian motions in the general framework of rcd spaces , whereby many singular spaces are included .",
    "moreover , we show several equivalences of the weak convergence of brownian motions and the pmg convergence of the underlying spaces . for references to other investigations regarding the stability problem ,",
