    "_ swift _ lgrbs do not fulfill these criteria , primarily because swift , for technical reasons , has to point close to the sun a significant fraction of the time . for bursts fulfilling the above criteria , we make every possible effort to detect optical and near - infrared afterglows and to measure their redshifts .",

    "<S> they allow us to study the deaths of single ( or binary ) massive stars possibly throughout the full timespan massive stars have existed in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> grbs provide a means to infer information about the environments and typical galaxies in which massive stars are formed . </S>",
    "<S> two main obstacles remain to be crossed before the full potential of grbs as probes of massive stars can be harvested : _ i _ ) we need to build more complete and well understood samples in order not to be fooled by biases , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ii ) _ we need to understand to which extent grbs may be intrinsically biased in the sense that they are only formed by a limited subset of massive stars defined by most likely a restricted metallicity interval . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the status of an ongoing effort to build a more complete sample of long - duration grbs with measured redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> already now we can conclude that the environments of grb progenitors are very diverse with metallicities ranging from solar to a hundredth solar and extinction ranging from none to @xmath0 mag . </S>",
    "<S> we have also identified a sightline with significant escape of lyman continuum photons and another with a clear 2175   extinction bump . </S>"
