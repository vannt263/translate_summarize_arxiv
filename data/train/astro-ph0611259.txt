    "there is an intricate mutual dynamical dependence between the central massive black hole ( mbh ) and the nuclear region of the host galaxy .",
    "centres of galaxies act as resonant cavities , and the mass of the central mbh contributes to the formation and locations of the resonances @xcite,@xcite .",
    "resonances can either halt or enhance radial gas flow , and thus can control fueling of the nucleus @xcite . among resonantly - induced features ,",
    "nuclear spirals form naturally as a gas response to non - axisymmetry in the gravitational potential of a galaxy @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in fact , recent high - resolution observations often find in the innermost few hundred parsecs of disc galaxies nuclear spirals @xcite,@xcite that are likely to continue inward to within a few parsecs from galaxy s centre @xcite,@xcite . because of their ubiquity , nuclear spirals were invoked as the mechanism by which material is transported to the central mbh @xcite . in this paper , i present implications of @xcite and @xcite for the diagnostic role of nuclear spirals , and i confront model predictions with the most recent observations .",
    "nuclear spirals form naturally as morphology of waves in gas , generated by a rotating asymmetry in the galactic gravitational potential .",
    "generation and propagation of waves is governed by dynamical resonances , whose presence and positions depend on the central mass distribution in the galaxy .",
    "simple linear approximation enables to describe the morphology of nuclear spiral for most typical rotation curves @xcite : +  @xmath0 , with a linear inner rise , reflecting solid - body rotation in the innermost parts of the galaxy , i.e. constant - density core , + ",
    "@xmath1 , same as @xmath0 but with a central mbh of mass consistent with the observed correlations ( e.g. @xcite ) , + ",
    "@xmath2 , a pure power - law , corresponding to a central density cusp . +",
    "these three representative rotation curves are presented in the upper panels of fig.1 , while the shapes of the nuclear spirals generated by a rotating bisymmetry in the potential are shown in the lower panels of fig.1 .",
    "if there is no central mbh , and if the rotation curve rises linearly in its innermost parts ( case @xmath0 ) , the nuclear spiral will not extend to the centre of the galaxy ( fig.1 , left column ) .",
    "if there is a mbh in the centre ( case @xmath1 ) , the nuclear spiral extends to the centre , and it tightly winds around the central mbh ( fig.1 , central column ) . if there is a central density cusp ( case @xmath2 ) , the nuclear spiral extends to the centre , but it unwinds towards the centre ( fig.1 , right column ) .",
    "rotation curves @xmath0 and @xmath2 appear similar , but their corresponding nuclear spirals are diametrically different .",
    "ubiquity of nuclear spirals in galaxies may indicate that approximating the inner rise of the rotation curve by a straight line is often inadequate .",
    "moreover , nuclear spiral tightly winding around the galactic centre may indicate the presence of a mbh there .",
    "nuclear spirals are resonant phenomena , and they can be generated by very small departures from axial symmetry in galaxies .",
    "aside for asymmetries in stellar distribution , other asymmetries may contribute to the overall galactic gravitational potential .",
    "if mbhs in centres of galaxies form by merging of smaller black holes , then there should be a few black holes of mass one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the central ones , orbiting around the centre of a typical galaxy ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "these black holes constitute a weak perturbation in the gravitational potential , which can generate wave phenomena in gas within a disc close to the centre of a galaxy .",
    "a single orbiting black hole about ten times less massive than the central black hole generates a three - arm spiral pattern in the central gaseous disc , with density excess in the spiral arms up to 3 - 12% ( @xcite : see fig.2 , left and central panels ) .",
    "dusty filaments that have been discovered recently in the centres of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) have luminosity lower from their surroundings by @xmath3% , therefore spiral patterns in gas generated by the most massive orbiting black holes should be detectable .",
    "interestingly , one of the best investigated nuclear spirals in ngc 1097 ( @xcite,@xcite ) has three arms ( fig.2 , right panel ) , difficult to generate by the observed bisymmetric bar only .",

    "right panel : vlt naco j - band image of the nuclear spiral in ngc 1097 after subtraction of radial intensity gradient by ellipse fitting .",
    "the side of the box is 8 arcsec , corresponding to about 0.55 kpc . ]",
    "in the present - day universe , 10 - 20 per cent of galaxies show nuclear activity of seyfert type .",
    "this activity is orders of magnitude weaker than that of quasars , and internal , dynamical factors are likely to play a role in triggering it .",
    "extensive morphological studies had no success in pointing out the mechanism that triggers the nuclear activity , but they might have focused on features on too large scales .",
    "a typical local active galactic nucleus ( agn ) consumes about 0.01 of fuel per year ( e.g. @xcite ) , most likely coming from gas inflow .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath4 during its @xmath5-yr long activity .",
    "therefore there is no need to transport gas from the outskirts of a galaxy in order to feed a local agn , but significant redistribution of gas in the innermost tens and hundreds of parsecs should be expected .        in strong bar ,",
    "the nuclear spiral has the nature of a shock in gas @xcite , which can trigger gas inflow throughout the spiral .",
    "note however , that analogously to gas flow in the region of straight principal shocks in the bar ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) , not all gas in the region of nuclear spiral shows radial inflow ( fig.3 ) . in fact , most of the volume is dominated by outflow of low - density gas , but inflow of dense post - shock gas in the spiral dominates the budget .",
    "therefore exclusive use of tracers of dense gas ( e.g. molecular emission ) can result in biased estimates of integrated radial flow of galactic gas .",
    "right panel of fig.4 shows line - of - sight velocities expected for the standard model 8s20 of nuclear spiral from @xcite , when viewed at inclination of 60 , and after subtracting contribution of circular motion .",
    "large streaming motions are expected , of amplitude of up to 50 .",
    "this amplitude can only be achieved when shocks in gas are involved .",
    "recently , the same algorithm has been applied to the kinematics of nuclear spiral in ngc 1097 observed with the integral field unit gmos on the very large telescope @xcite .",
    "strong streaming motions of amplitude about 50  that show spiral morphology , have been observed .",
    "_ that observation confirms presence of shocks in nuclear spirals . _    note that the modelled kinematical spiral arms do not overlap with the spiral gas morphology ( fig.4 , left panel ) .",
    "this is because the matter distribution is point - symmetric , while the velocity vectors  point - antisymmetric .",
    "the shift between the kinematical and morphological spiral arms predicted by the models is consistent with that observed in ngc 1097 @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical models of nuclear spiral shocks indicate the rate of inflow in the innermost parsecs of a galaxy up to 0.03 @xcite .",
    "this inflow is sufficient to feed luminous local agn , and the feeding can continue over long timescales .",
    "nuclear spiral shock is less tightly wound than what the linear theory predicts , hence loosely wound spirals in the classification developed in @xcite may indicate spiral shocks .",
    "interestingly , when in that classification one groups together grand - design nuclear spirals ( explicitly linked to shocks in bars ) and loosely wound spirals , they occur considerably more often in active than in non - active galaxies @xcite,@xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical models of nuclear spirals presented here assume that galactic gas is a continuous medium , which can be statistically approximated by isothermal fluid",
    ". one may expect that this approximation breaks down at scales small enough , but it is still likely to hold on 10-pc scale , because continuous dusty nuclear spiral arms extend down to within that distance from the nucleus .",
    "perhaps this approximation is most appropriate for the dynamic interstellar medium , in which dense clouds continuously form and disperse .",
    "the shape of nuclear spiral can serve as an indicator of the presence of a mbh in a galaxy s centre , and as an estimator of its mass .",
    "the amplitude of the spiral can constrain asymmetries in the galaxy s potential , like orbiting remnant black holes left from the time of galaxy formation .",
    "nuclear spirals in galaxies can either be weak density waves which can not feed the nucleus , or strong dissipative shocks , which can generate gas inflow large enough to power luminous local agn .",
    "nuclear spiral shocks should be revealed in kinematical observations by strong streaming motions , and such motions of amplitude consistent with theoretical predictions have been recently observed .",
    "this observation makes a sound argument in support of gas inflow in nuclear spirals , which can serve as a mechanism feeding the central mbh and leading the the agn phenomenon .",
