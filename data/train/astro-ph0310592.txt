    "the uninterrupted 7-day _ asca _  observation of the tev blazar mrk  421 in 1998 has revealed that day - scale x  ray flares seen in previous observations were probably unresolved superpositions of many smaller flares @xcite .",
    "the nearly  continuous observation allowed not only the possibility to track the individual flares entirely from the rise to decay , but it also enabled quantitative statistical tests of the time series by employing the power spectrum or the structure function @xcite .",
    "the main characteristic of blazars is their high flux observed from radio to @xmath7rays coupled with strong variability and strong polarization .",
    "these properties are now successfully explained by the scenario where blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , possessing jets aligned close to the line of sight , and accordingly the doppler - boosted non - thermal emission from the jet dominates other emission components ( e.g. blandford & knigl 1979 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",
    "this is what makes blazars critical in understanding jets in agn .",
    "the broadband spectra of blazars consist of two peaks , one in the radio to optical ",
    "uv range ( and in some cases , reaching to the x  ray band ) , and the other in the hard x  ray to @xmath7ray region .",
    "the high polarization of the radio to optical emission suggests that the lower energy peak is produced via the synchrotron process by relativistic electrons in the jet .",
    "the higher energy peak is believed to be due to compton up - scattering of seed photons by the same population of relativistic electrons .",
    "several possibilities exist for the source of the seed photons ; these can be the synchrotron photons internal to the jet @xcite , but also external , such as from the broad emission line clouds @xcite or from the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "the blazars with peak synchrotron output in the x  ray range also emit strongly in the @xmath7ray energies , and the brightest of those have been detected in the tev range with ground - based cherenkov arrays .",
    "these are the so - called `` tev blazars . '' in tev blazars , variability of the synchrotron flux is measured to be the strongest and most rapid in the x  ray band , and thus it provides the best opportunity to study the electrons that are accelerated to the highest energies . in particular , the synchrotron  peak is a very important observable in two aspects : first because the flux at the peak represents the total emitted power from the blazar , and secondly because the peak frequency reflects the maximum energy of radiating particles gained in the acceleration process .",
    "mrk  421 is among the closest known blazars , at redshift of 0.031 , and was the first blazar ( and also the first extragalactic source ) discovered to be a tev emitter .",
    "it was first detected as a weak source by egret @xcite , and 9 months later , _ whipple_detected a clear signal from this object between 0.5 and 1.5 tev @xcite .",
    "flux variability on various time scales has been observed , including a very short flare with a duration of @xmath81 hour @xcite .",
    "ever since , mrk  421 has been repeatedly confirmed to be a tev source by various ground - based telescopes .",
    "it has also been one of the most studied blazars , and have been a target of several multi - wavelength campaigns @xcite .",
    "the multi - wavelength campaign of mrk  421 in 1998 was one of the first opportunities to observe a blazar in the tev range using several telescopes located in different locations in the world , so as to have as continuous coverage as possible @xcite .",

    ", the efficiency of both sis detectors below @xmath81 kev has been decreasing over time .",
    "the problem is believed to be caused by the increased residual dark current level , and also by the decrease in the charge transfer efficiency , although effort is still underway to model the effects .",
    "while it has been reported that it may be possible to parameterize the degradation by an additional absorption column as a function of time @xcite , since our observation concerns the precise shape of the continuum spectrum , we will use only the data obtained by the gis for spectral analysis .",
    "( note that the x  ray spectra in figure  2 of @xcite show the data obtained by sis .",
    "for this , there is a too strong decrease of inferred flux at the lower energy , which is due to instrumental effects described above . )      the _ rxte _  observations ( pi : g.  madejski ) were mainly coordinated to coincide with the _ asca _  observation period , but were conducted mostly only during the low - background orbits .",

    "the screening criteria excluded the data when the elevation angle from the earth s limb was lower than 10 , and the data acquired during the saa passages .",
    "since the pcus are activated during the saa passage , we used the data only after when the background level dropped to the quiescent level and became stable , which is typically 30 minutes after the peak of a saa passage .",
    "for the best signal - to - noise , we selected events only from the top xenon layer , and excluded events from other gas layers . for the maximum consistency among the observations , we used only the three detectors which were turned on for all the observations ( known as pcu0 , pcu1 , and pcu2 ) . since the pca is not an imaging detector ,",

    "for the background photons , we constructed the spectra by extracting the photons from the same detector regions using blank - sky observations .",
    "each spectrum was rebinned using the grouping templates provided by the _ bepposa@xmath0x _",

    "the _ euve _",
    "observations covered the entire campaign of mrk  421 from april 19.4 to may 1.2 ( pi : t.  takahashi ) .",
    "the source photons were extracted in a 12 arcmin aperture . in order to estimate the absolute flux in the euv range",
    ", we normalized it to be consistent with the simultaneous data obtained by the other observatories .",
    "given that the euv spectrum is difficult to determine within the rather limited bandpass , we used only the observed integrated count rate ( cf .",
    "marshall , fruscione & carone 1995 ) .",
    "for this , we used the period where the observations by all observatories overlapped ( mjd 50927.03 - 50927.34 ;  [ sec : combine ] ) . during this period , the average _ euve _  count rate was 0.46@xmath160.01 cts / s . at the same time , the 0.130.18 kev flux derived from the combined lecs , mecs , gis , and pca spectrum gives @xmath17 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath14 , where the error represents the statistical error .",
    "an additional uncertainty arises from the fact that the difference in the spectral shape is not taken in to account .",
    "this can be estimated from the results in @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath19 @xmath18 for mrk  421 , assuming that the spectrum index varies from 0.5 to 1.0 , the flux density would vary from 13631394 @xmath20jy for 1 cts / s in the _ euve _  range .",
    "this gives an additional 2.5% error as a systematic error .",
    "in the following analysis , we use the above value for scaling the observed _ euve _  count rate to flux .",

    "asca _ , _ bepposa@xmath0x _ , _ rxte _ , and also _ euve _  happened to exactly overlap continuously for 26.5 ksec ( mjd 50927.03 - 50927.34 ) .",
    "this provides us with high quality data over a very broad energy coverage , spanning more than 2 decades , from 0.12 to 25 kev . the net exposure for each instrument during the overlapping 26.5 ks period were 9.1 , 13.3 , 3.6 , and 5.5 ksec for gis , pca , lecs , mecs , respectively .",
    "we first fitted the spectrum for each instrument with a power - law model , with a low energy absorption fixed to the galactic value , @xmath23 @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in the top half of table  [ tbl : fit ] , suggesting that the fit is not adequate for any of the individual instruments .",
    "this certainly suggests that a more complex model , rather than just a simple power - law function , is required to describe the spectrum .",
    "the shape of the synchrotron  spectrum is determined from the energy distribution of the radiating electrons , which cuts off at the high energy representing the acceleration limit .",
    "as described in the introduction , the high energy end of the synchrotron  spectrum in tev blazars is located in the x  ray range ; this is most likely the reason that the high - quality x ",
    "ray data can not be described by a single power - law .    given the curved spectrum for each instrument , we fitted the combined x  ray spectrum with various functions to model the shape of the observed curvature .",
    "we note that our aim is not to develop the shape of the curvature from first principles , but rather , to reproduce the observed data . for this reason",
    ", we considered the following models for comparison : ( 1 ) a broken power - law , ( 2 ) a curved power - law , ( 3 ) a power - law with an exponential cutoff , and ( 4 ) a quadratic function in @xmath24-@xmath25@xmath9  plane .",
    "the curved power - law that we define below is similar to the broken power - law model , but the change in the spectral index is not discrete .",
    "the form attempted by us is @xmath26 .",
    "the form for the exponentially cutoff power law is @xmath27 , and the quadratic function is described as @xmath28 .",
    "since there are slight differences in the cross - calibration between the instruments , we allow the normalization to vary for each instrument .",
    "for all results below , the flux will be normalized to the gis value , unless otherwise noted .",
    "the @xmath29 is fixed to the galactic value .    by fitting the spectrum with the models above",
    ", we first found that the power - law with an exponential cutoff is not a good representation of the data : the model cutoff is too sharp at high energies .",
    "the broken power - law model is also not acceptable , and the curved power - law is significantly better .",
    "we also find that the quadratic function fits the spectrum surprisingly well .",
    "the fitted spectrum and the residuals to the quadratic model are shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] , where all lecs , mecs , gis , and pca spectra are shown to be well described with this single function . the results of the spectral fits by the 4 models are summarized in in the bottom half of table  [ tbl : fit ] .",
    "the _ euve _  observation covered the whole campaign ( april 19.4 to may 1.2 ) , and thus completely overlapped our 7-day _ asca _  observation .",
    "this adds a data point at 0.13 - 0.18 kev in addition to the _ asca _  spectrum in the 0.77 kev range , providing us the best opportunity to study the continuous spectral variability .",
    "in fact this is the longest continuous monitoring of this object so far spanning over the 0.137 kev range .",
    "we divided the whole observation into shorter segments with each having a duration of 10 ksec . in order to combine the gis and _ euve _  data ,",
    "the gis count rate spectra must first be converted to the source flux spectra as the _ euve _  count rate data converts directly into flux (  2.4 ) . for this",
    ", we first fit the gis spectrum with a curved power - law model with galactic absorption .",
    "this gives the source spectrum in the gis energy range .",
    "note that this procedure depends on the selected model , but long as it describes the spectrum well , this should introduce the smallest bias .",
    "we then combine this with the _ euve _   data , which gives the combined source spectrum .    in fitting the combined _ euve_/gis spectra , we first started with a single power - law model . in similarity to the results in  3.1",
    ", none of the 56 spectra could be fit with a single power - law function , with their average @xmath30 of 7.7 , implying the curvature of the spectra for all data sets .",
    "given that a quadratic model fits the spectrum equally well as the curved power - law model , but with fewer parameters ( see  3.1 ) , we will assume the quadratic model for all data sets hereafter .",
    "in fact , because of the energy gap between the _ euve _  and gis , the fit with a curved power - law model resulted in having multiple minima in the @xmath31 plane ( since the parameters are correlated ) , and the exact value of the best - fit parameters depended highly on the initial value .",
    "we checked whether the fit was adequate for all data segments .",
    "the @xmath30 for each fit ( shown in the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : lcpeak ] ) ranged from 0.71 to 1.45 .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ranges from 60 to 187 , which gave @xmath325% for 53 out of the total of 56 data points .",
    "for the other 3 data points ( corresponding to times 230240 , 270280 , and 450460 ksec ) , we found several line or edge - like structures in the spectra , which resulted in the increase of @xmath30 .",
    "although it is not clear whether this is due to some systematic effect or if it is a true property of the source , since our aim is to model the continuum spectrum correctly , we excluded the energy ranges where those features are present .",
    "this improved the fit significantly , which is shown as the crosses . with this , all the 56 spectra were well described with the quadratic function .",
    "the time evolution of the derived parameters in the fit is shown in the top 3 panels in figure  [ fig : lcpeak ] ; the peak flux , peak energy , and the curvature parameter @xmath33 ( see definition in table  [ tbl : fit ] ) .",
    "the peak energy is observed to shift between 0.5 kev and 1.2 kev , in which a general trend is found such that the peak energy is higher when the peak flux is higher .",
    "this is demonstrated as the filled circles in figure  [ fig : fpep - all ] .",
    "the fit results are listed in table  [ tbl : lcpeak ] .",
    "we do note that the actual validity of using a quadratic function in the entire 0.125 kev range was checked in detail ( including an examination of trends in residuals ) only for the epoch when the overlapping _ bepposa@xmath0x _",
    ", _ asca _ , and _ rxte _",
    "observations were available .",
    "since we measured only the _ euve _  flux below 0.7 kev in the combined _",
    "euve_/gis fit , the derived peak location can depend on the model function we assume .",
    "for instance if @xmath34 function was allowed , the peak can be located at any energy within the gap . for this , we emphasize that the derived peak location is the estimated peak , assuming that the spectrum gap can be extrapolated with the same quadratic function , and also that the error bar describes only the statistical error",
    ".    we also analyzed the _",
    "bepposa@xmath0x _",
    "data during the campaign .",
    "furthermore , in order to make a comparison with data obtained from another campaign , we also analyzed the _",
    "bepposa@xmath0x _",
    "data obtained in 1997 ( pi : g.  vacanti , l.  chiappetti ) .",
    "we divided the observation into segments of the same 10 ks duration , and fit the combined lecs / mecs spectra with a quadratic function .",
    "bepposa@xmath0x _  data",
    ", we also fit the spectra with a curved power - law model for comparison .",
    "the derived peak flux and peak energy from both models are listed in table  [ tbl : lcpeak_sax ] . in fitting the combined lecs / mecs spectra ,",
    "the normalizations are allowed to vary independently , and the values in table  [ tbl : lcpeak_sax ] are normalized to the mecs2 value .",
    "the fitting results show that although the spectral fit parameter is one less in the quadratic function , both models equally represent the observed spectra .",
    "in contrast to the combined _ euve_/gis data , there is no energy gap in the _ bepposa@xmath0x _  data , which provides support that our assumed quadratic form is appropriate in estimating the peak location in the _ euve_/gis case . the derived peak flux and peak energy using both functions are similar , but we also note that the quadratic function gives a slightly lower peak energy than the curved power - law function .    the derived peak flux and peak energy assuming the quadratic model for the _ bepposa@xmath0x _  observations are shown in figure  [ fig : fpep - all ] as the open circles ( for 1998 ) and squares ( for 1997 ) .",
    "note that the _ bepposa@xmath0x _  data points in figure  [ fig : fpep - all ] are multiplied by a normalization factor of 1.07 , which we adopted from the combined fit in  3.1 it can be seen that the results during the 1998 campaign lie on a similar slope as the results derived from the _ euve_/gis data during the same campaign .",
    "the relation of peak flux @xmath5 and peak energy @xmath4 for the _ euve_/gis data set can be best described with a power - law function of @xmath35 , where @xmath36=0.72@xmath160.02 ( or @xmath37=0.76@xmath160.02 in form @xmath38 ; see description below ) . by including also",

    "we fit simultaneously both 1997 and 1998 for _ bepposa@xmath0x _  data points only .",
    "this gave @xmath36=0.52@xmath160.02 ( @xmath37=0.45@xmath160.01 ) .",
    "the estimated @xmath37 is slightly smaller than reported in @xcite , which might be affected by different subdividing of the observations .",
    "nonetheless , it is worth noting that the slope derived from the combined data appears be softer ( smaller @xmath36 or @xmath37 ) than each epoch considered alone .    furthermore , the relation appeared to also vary between individual flares during the 1998 campaign . in some flares the peak energy clearly increases together with flux , while the correlation is weaker in others .",
    "this can be seen clearly in figure  [ fig : fpep - each ] , which shows the evolution of the synchrotron peak in each flare .",
    "the peak energy has a trend to shift to the higher energy and then return to the initial value together with the flux , but there is no common slope .      in the previous section",

    "given that the _ rxte _",
    "observations happen mostly during the flare minima rather than at their peaks ( see figure  1 in takahashi et al .",

    "note that the spectra are further rebinned for this figure .",
    "for each flare , we also plot a subsequent spectrum , but those only include the _ euve _  and gis data .    to see the evolution more clearly , we calculated the ratio of the rebinned spectra by dividing these `` subsequent '' spectra by the spectrum measured at the onset of a given flare ( integrated over 8090 , 260270 , 340350 ksec , respectively ) .",

    "it can be seen that flare 2 starts with a hardening at the very highest energy range with a concave shape in the ratio .",
    "as time progresses , the whole energy range becomes dominated by a new spectral slope .",
    "in contrast to this , in flare 4 the lower energy photons appear to precede the total flux rise . flare 5 was similar to flare 2 , but all energy bands increase together , with a larger amplitude at higher energies .",

    "note that the spectra are further rebinned in the figures .",
    "while each integration time is as short as several hours , it can be seen that the curved shape of the high energy peak of the synchrotron  spectrum is clearly resolved , and it is evident that the peak is located in the x  ray range .",
    "the results of fits to each x  ray spectrum concurrent with the tev pointings are summarized in table  [ tbl : xtev ] .",
    "we also list the simultaneous tev fluxes , in which the _ hegra _  data were taken by @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : xtev ] , we show the correlation of the derived location of the synchrotron   peak flux with the tev flux . since the sensitive energy ranges of the two tev telescopes are slightly different , we used the integrated flux in crab units .",
    "a good correlation can be seen , showing that the tev flux is higher when the synchrotron  peak flux is higher .",
    "a best fit to the relation with a power - law function gives @xmath41 with @xmath36=1.7@xmath160.3 .",
    "we have performed detailed analysis of the combined _ euve _ , _ asca _ , _ bepposa@xmath0x _ , and _ rxte _  data collected during the long look campaign of mrk  421 in 1998 , resulting in the measurement of the time - resolved spectrum in a broad energy range of 0.125 kev in segments as short as several ksec .",
    "these are among the highest quality spectra with regard to both photon statistics and energy coverage so far for any blazar , providing the precise spectral shape at the highest energy end of the synchrotron   spectrum .",
    "we have shown that both curved power - law function and quadratic function in @xmath24@xmath25@xmath9  space reproduce the combined _ euve _ , _ bepposa@xmath0x _ , _ asca _ , and _ rxte _  spectrum .",
    "for the epochs where _",
    "bepposa@xmath0x _  data do not exist , we assumed that the spectral gap between @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be extrapolated with a quadratic function , and we showed that the energy and the flux at the synchrotron  peak in the @xmath9  spectrum are correlated , showing an overall trend of a higher synchrotron  peak energy for higher peak flux , but the details of this relation differed from flare to flare . in particular , within the three flare beginnings , one flare started from a rise in the higher energy while another started from a rise in the lower energy .",
    "the relative amplitude of the rise in different energies also differed from flare to flare .",
    "an interesting result was shown from the 2nd flare , where it was indicated that this flare started with a hardening at the higher energy .",
    "this feature is difficult to describe by a simple cooling or acceleration of a single electron distribution ( see e.g. kataoka 2000 ) , and thus this concave curvature indicates that two different spectral components were likely to co - exist at the beginning of the flare .",
    "we remark that such a behavior is observed in only one flare , but the importance is that we observed a flare that could not be explained by a single electron distribution .",
    "this suggests an appearance of a new component , which generated the observed flare .",
    "recently , many theoretical studies has been performed to model the energy dependence , or time lags observed in the day - scale flares in blazars .",
    "one approach considers models with a homogeneous emission region @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite have suggested that a sudden increase in the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons could result in the x  ray and tev flare observed in mrk  421 .",
    "similar results were shown by @xcite , in reproducing the soft - lag observed in pks  2155304 .",
    "however , most of these models assume a change in some parameter in the emission region ( such as the magnetic field , maximum energy of electrons , number density of electrons , etc . ) .",
    "the observational results for mrk  421 described above lead us to suggest a different scenario .",
    "an alternative scenario has each flare forming as a result of a separate electron distribution .",
    "this was suggested in modeling the high state sed of mrk  501 @xcite .",
    "they applied the one - zone homogeneous synchrotron self - compton model to the sed from april 1997 , and concluded that a single electron distribution is insufficient to reproduce the observed synchrotron spectrum .",
    "this scenario could work for instance when the jet is emitted intermittently from the central engine , and several separate regions generate different emission components .",
    "another viable scenario can be provided by an internal shock model , where the light curve results from a superposition of many flares due to the collisions of shells , which may occur when a faster shell catches up to a slower shell ( ghisellini 2001 , spada et al .",
    "2001 ; sikora et al .",
    "2001 )    in fact , @xcite has shown from simulations that the internal shock model can naturally explain various variability properties observed in tev blazars .",
    "one observational fact is that the x ",
    "ray flares always appear to lie on top of an underlying offset - like component . in the internal shock model , flares can be considered as arising from collisions of shells that had the largest difference in the initial velocity .",
    "all other collisions generate smaller amplitude , longer flares , which pile up to generate the offset component . in this case",
    ", it was shown that the flares will tend to have a higher synchrotron  peak energy as compared with that of the offset component .",
    "assuming that flares are due to an emergence of a new component with a higher synchrotron  peak energy than the pre - existing component , the synchrotron  peak energy in the observed spectrum would appear as shifting to a higher energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that our observations are consistent with this , with the overall trend of the synchrotron  peak energy being higher during flares .",
    "furthermore in this case , the spectral evolution would depend on the relation of the new and pre - existing spectra .",
    "this would naturally explain the different spectral evolution among different flares .    finally , we remark again that due to the data gap between the _ euve _  and _ asca _  data in our observation , the results concerning the spectrum peak are somewhat tentative . because of the rapid variability of the source in short time scales , the effective area of the instrument is most important .",
    "long - look observations by the new observatories such as @xmath44-@xmath45 should provide data allowing a more detailed analysis of the flaring mechanism , leading to the dynamics of the accelerated electrons in blazar jets .",
