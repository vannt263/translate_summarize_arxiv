    "the last 10 years have seen a rapid advance in our understanding of gamma - ray bursts , due mainly to the study of grb afterglows .",
    "we now know that at least some of the long duration grbs ( that last for more than about 5s ) are produced in the collapse of massive ( young ) stars @xcite as proposed by @xcite and @xcite , and short duration bursts are associated with old stellar populations and are a likely product of merging neutron - star binaries @xcite ; for recent reviews please see @xcite .",
    "we also have good estimates of the total energy and beaming for these explosions as well as the property of the medium within about 1 pc of the explosion ( rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran & halpern , 1999 ; frail et al 2001 ; panaitescu & kumar , 2001 ) .",
    "however , our understanding of how the prompt @xmath0-ray emission is generated , and the mechanism for energy transport from the central engine ( via magnetic field or kinetic energy of protons - neutrons and/or electron - positron pairs ) remains highly uncertain .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a nearly model independent way of modeling the prompt @xmath0-ray emission with synchrotron or synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) processes .",
    "we determine the basic properties of the @xmath0-ray source from the data , and then determine how these can be interpreted in currently popular models such as the internal / external shock model .    in the next section we provide the basic idea and details of the technique we use to model @xmath0-ray emission",

    "2006 ) , and in  3 &  4 we describe the synchrotron and ssc results , respectively .",
    "the starting point for our modeling of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission in grbs is the assumption that the radiation is produced via the synchrotron or synchrotron - self - compton processes in a source moving relativistically outward from the inner engine .",
    "figure  [ fig : shellpars ] provides a cartoon description of our model . for a simple grb light - curve ( lc ) consisting of a single peak",
    "we determine the average source properties corresponding to the time when the observed light curve peaks , and for a multi - peak grb lc our calculation applies to individual pulses or spikes in the lightcurve .",
    "the source property can be uniquely described by the following set of 5 parameters : the magnetic field strength ( @xmath15 ) in gauss , the number of radiating particles ( @xmath16 ) i.e. , electrons and positrons , the optical depth of the source to thomson scattering ( @xmath17 ) , the lorentz factor of the source with respect to the rest frame of the grb host galaxy ( @xmath18 ) , and the minimum electron energy , however , for convenience we suppress the factor @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 at the location where particles are accelerated ( all the variables we use in this paper are defined in table 1 for easy reference ) .",
    "in addition , the particle distribution above @xmath20 is taken to be a power - law function : @xmath21 .",
    "particles cool as a result of radiative losses and with time , or as they travel away from the acceleration site , and the distribution function becomes steeper than the index @xmath22 at some energy where radiative losses become important . we calculate the modified distribution self - consistently as discussed below . we constrain this 5d parameter space with at least 4 observed quantities  the @xmath13 peak frequency @xmath23 , the spectral index below @xmath23 , the flux @xmath24 at @xmath23 , the decay time of a single pulse in a grb lc @xmath25 ; @xmath22 , the power law index , is constrained by the high energy spectral index , for @xmath26 .    -ray source properties can be described by five parameters   that determine the observed flux at one instance in time .",

    "piran 1992 ; lithwick & sari , 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we can treat the source for prompt @xmath0-ray emission as spherically symmetric , and the numerical values we quote in this paper are all isotropic equivalent quantities ; for instance @xmath16 is the total number of radiating particles in the source assuming the source to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the synchrotron injection frequency , @xmath35 , corresponding to electron minimum energy @xmath20 , is @xmath69 ( eg .",

    "the synchrotron cooling frequency , @xmath32 , the characteristic frequency at which electrons cooling on a time scale @xmath60 ( observer frame ) radiate , is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the thomson scattering cross - section , and @xmath61 the compton parameter .    for most of the calculations in this work",
    "we assume that electrons are accelerated only once , and the time scale for acceleration is taken to be much less than the duration of a pulse in the grb light - curve ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "one time acceleration is , for instance , believed to apply to shocks where electrons are accelerated at the shock front ( by crossing the front back and forth multiple times ) and not while they travel downstream ; the picture is likely very different in magnetic reconnection / dissipation . to capture some of the effects of multiple - times particle acceleration in time period of a pulse duration in grb lc we introduce a time scale , @xmath60 , which is the average time in between two successive episodes of particle acceleration or the time available for electrons to cool in between acceleration ; for one shot acceleration @xmath75 , and in the opposite limit of continuous acceleration @xmath76 when the rate of energy gain is balanced by radiative loss rate .",
    "the electron distribution function resulting from the acceleration process is taken to be @xmath77 .",
    "the distribution function in the source as a whole is different due to the radiative cooling of electrons with time .",
    "the electron distribution function averaged over the source is described by two characteristic energies viz . @xmath20 and @xmath31 ; @xmath78 is the energy of electrons that cool on time scale @xmath60 .",
    "the electron distribution for @xmath79 is proportional to @xmath80 , and the distribution between @xmath31 and @xmath20 ( for @xmath81 ) is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse - compton losses .",
    "the rate of loss of energy is affected by the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath30  electrons with characteristic synchrotron frequency below @xmath30 lose energy only via the inverse - compton scattering process .",
    "we calculate @xmath31 and @xmath30 by solving a coupled set of equations as described in @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron flux at the peak of the @xmath83 spectrum , at @xmath84 $ ] , is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "the effect of synchrotron self absorption is not included in the above expression for @xmath56 , and therefore the observed flux , in general , would be different from @xmath56 .",
    "the flux at other frequencies are calculated as described in sari , piran and narayan ( 1998 ) .    the inverse - compton flux ( in observer frame ) at frequency @xmath87 , @xmath88 ,",
    "is calculated using the following equation ( cf .",
    "rybicki & lightman , 1979 ) @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the synchrotron flux per unit frequency in the observer frame , @xmath91 is the radial extent of the source ( comoving frame ) which is related to the optical depth @xmath17 ( one of the five parameters we use to characterize the source ) , the function @xmath92 is @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the minimum lf for electron distribution .",
    "we include the klein - nishina correction to the above expression when @xmath95 .",
    "the expression for the compton y parameter is @xmath96 where the @xmath97-integral is over the comoving radial width of the source .",
    "for ease of future use we rewrite the above expression for @xmath61 as @xmath98 where @xmath99 in our 5d parameter space search , we limit the compton @xmath61-parameter for a synchrotron solution to be less than 10 and for an inverse - compton solution @xmath100 .",
    "the rationale for the constraint on the @xmath61-parameter is that we want an efficiency of @xmath101% in the @xmath0-ray energy band of @xmath102 10400 kev ; observations suggest this efficiency for a typical long duration burst from a comparison of energy in the @xmath0-ray radiation and the kinetic energy of the ejecta determined from the afterglow observations ( panaitescu & kumar , 2002 ) .",
    "we can calculate the distance of the source from the center of explosion with 2 of the 5 parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath103      we consider a @xmath0-ray source of a finite lifetime , at a distance @xmath1 from the central explosion , that is responsible for generating one pulse in the observed grb prompt lightcurve .",
    "electrons in the source are heated during some time interval , set by the central engine variability / activity time , and subsequently the source undergoes adiabatic expansion .",
    "the width of an observed grb pulse is determined by a number of different factors  the central engine variability time , the adiabatic expansion and cooling time , and the curvature time  which are described below .    1 .",
    "* central engine variability time : _ sets the observed grb pulse width if the variability time is larger than @xmath104 and if the distance where @xmath0-ray photons are generated does not increase with time ; in this case grb pulse duration is independent of @xmath1 . however ,",
    "when the source is turned off the @xmath0-ray flux would decline on a timescale of @xmath105 , the adiabatic expansion time scale ; for all the calculations in this work we use the light - curve decline time although for simplicity we continue to refer to it as pulse width . _ * 2 .",
    "* curvature timescale : _ is the time interval between arrival of photons with angular separation of @xmath106 as seen by an observer at the center of explosion .",
    "it is the minimum time scale for a @xmath0-ray pulse width , as long as the outflow from the grb has an angular size larger than @xmath107 , and is equal to @xmath108 .",
    "_ * 3 .   *",
    "adiabatic expansion time scale ",
    "_ this is the timescale for electrons / protons to cool because of expansion of the source . as the distance of the source from the center doubles its volume increases by a factor @xmath109 , and electron / proton energy drops by a factor  2 .",
    "this timescale in the observer frame is @xmath110_*. + we note that if electrons are heated by coupling with protons , then the time scale for electrons to cool down can be larger than @xmath108 ; @xmath52 cooling time in this case can be as large as @xmath111(proton energy / electron energy ) provided that protons transfer energy to electrons for this time duration , and the energy transfer rate balances the loss of energy for electrons to adiabatic and radiative coolings .",
    "however , the coupling between @xmath112s and @xmath52s is unlikely to increase the pulse width by a large factor ( @xmath113 ) unless the energy in electrons is much smaller than in @xmath112s , but in that case the efficiency of @xmath0-ray generation would be small which is not supported by observations .",
    "* radiative cooling timescale . * for @xmath114 the radiative cooling time scale is larger than the adiabatic time scale and in that case grb pulse width is equal to the adiabatic or curvature time . for @xmath115",
    "electrons cool on a smaller time scale , and once electron heating stops , the lightcurve falls off on the curvature timescale .",
    "we note that the observed pulse duration can not be larger than @xmath116 which corresponds to an elapsed time of @xmath117 in the center of explosion frame , and during this time the source has moved to @xmath1 from the center .",
    "thus we see that the observed decay time for a pulse in grb lc , produced by a relativistic source , is @xmath118 when the grb redshift is @xmath62 .",
    "the total energy in the source consists of the kinetic energy of electrons and positrons ( @xmath46 ) and the magnetic field ( @xmath47 ) : @xmath119 note that @xmath120 is the average energy per electron / positron in the source comoving frame at the acceleration site , and in the calculation of @xmath47 we took the comoving radial thickness of the source to be @xmath121 which is roughly what one expects for a causally connected source where the signal speed is close to the speed of light .",
    "we do not make any assumptions regarding the energy in protons since protons do not contribute to the observed @xmath0-ray radiation .",
    "this has the effect that the parameter space we determine is larger than it would be if protons carried a substantial amount of energy since the energy available to @xmath52 would be smaller than the upper limit of 10@xmath122 erg ( isotropic equivalent ) we impose in our search for solutions in the 5d parameter space .    for a @xmath0-ray source that arises from shock heated gas , the minimum electron energy behind the shock front , @xmath20 ( one of the five parameters we use ) ,",
    "can be related to the lorentz factor of the shocked gas wrt the unshocked gas , @xmath33 .",
    "the minimum @xmath33 needed to produce @xmath20 is @xmath1232\\gamma_i , \\label{gamsh}\\ ] ] where @xmath124 ( @xmath71 ) is proton ( electron ) mass .",
    "the factor 2 in the above expression is for the case where there is an energy equipartition between electrons and protons and there are no @xmath52 pairs in the plasma ; @xmath33 will be larger if there are pairs or if electrons have less energy than protons .",
    "energy , we would in that case overestimate @xmath33 .",
    "however , in this work we do not consider that there is a cold component to the @xmath0-ray source since such a component would not radiate and affect observations and the solutions in the 5-d parameter space .",
    "therefore , such a cold component , if present , would have little effect on all of the major results in this work ; the only quantity affected by the cold component is the value for @xmath33 which is a peripheral quantity and not part of the central flow of the logic in this paper . ]      we determine the properties of the @xmath0-ray source for a grb by finding the region in the 5-d parameter space   that satisfies the following set of observational constraints : 1 ) the frequency at the peak of the @xmath13 spectrum ( @xmath23 ) ; 2 ) the peak flux at @xmath23 ; 3 ) the spectral index above @xmath23  which constrains electron index @xmath22  and the index below @xmath23 ; 4 ) the burst duration  for a grb with a single pulse in the lc  or the duration of an individual pulse ( @xmath25 ) for grbs with complicated lc ; 5 ) optical and x - ray prompt flux or limit if available .",
    "the flux at a given observer time reflects the property of the source averaged over equal - arrival - time volume , therefore , the observed peak flux depends on the evolution of the source and this introduces uncertainty in the flux calculation by a factor of about two .",
    "for this reason we only require the theoretical flux to match the observed value to within a factor of @xmath125 .",
    "we now use this technique to find the 5d solution space and source property for grbs produced via synchrotron (  3 ) and ssc (  4 ) .",
    "we consider in this section the parameter space of solutions when the observed @xmath0-rays are produced via the synchrotron process - ray generation for those bursts that have low energy spectrum @xmath126 ( medvedev , 2000 ) .",
    "we show in appendix * b * that whenever jitter radiation dominates the observed flux to produce a @xmath126 spectrum the compton - y parameter is extremely large  @xmath127  and",
    "most of the energy of the explosion comes out in @xmath128 gev ssc photons . ] .",
    "first , we determine approximate solutions by analytically solving a system of equations for our 5 parameters  for the generic synchrotron case .",
    "the solutions for each parameter are expressed in terms of the compton @xmath61 parameter and three observed quantities : the frequency @xmath23 where @xmath13 peaks , the @xmath0-ray flux at this frequency ( @xmath24 ; in mjy ) , and the duration of a pulse in grb lc ( @xmath25 ) ; @xmath61 is a convenient and useful parameter because its value is expected to lie in a limited range , e.g. @xmath129 for the synchrotron solutions & @xmath130 for the ssc process .",
    "having the general synchrotron solutions in hand , we then apply the analytical results to the low energy spectral index cases of @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , compare the analytical and numerical results , and draw conclusions as to the process by which @xmath0-rays are generated in grbs ; the spectral index @xmath27 is defined by @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",

( 2004 ) , ramirez - ruiz & granot ( 2006 ) ; the issue of variability in external shocks is discussed in sari & piran ( 1997a ) , dermer & mitman ( 1999 ) , nakar & granot ( 2006 ) .",
    "we do nt have anything particularly enlightening to say regarding the external shock model that has not already been mentioned by one of these authors ; the general problem with shocks is discussed in  3 &  4 .",
    "the main difference between previous works and our approach is that previous works considered the forward problem i.e. , starting with a parameterization of the properties of colliding shells and resulting shocks the emergent radiation field was calculated , whereas our approach is to start with the minimum number of physical parameters needed ( five ) to calculate the observed flux and spectrum  at one instant in time or for one pulse in a multi - pulse grb lightcurve  and determine these using the observed data . for synchrotron & ic radiations the parameters needed are @xmath672 , and @xmath17 , which are determined by the observational data @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 for a pulse in grb lc .",
    "the 5 parameters in turn are used to provide constraint on the nature of grb source .",
    "the _ old _ _ forward approach _ is wedded to a particular model  either internal or external shock  whereas the method used in this work is relatively model independent .",
    "the parameters of the internal shock model can be mapped into the five parameters @xmath673 , @xmath18 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath674 in a straightforward manner  this in fact is done implicitly in all the _ forward approach _",
    "papers in order to calculate the emergent radiation .",
    "the converse of this is not true , however , since the internal shock model has more than 5 independent parameters ( appendix a describes how to go from the five parameters to providing a limit on some of the internal shock parameters such as the initial lfs of colliding shells and their comoving densities ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite carried out a fairly detailed analysis of prompt emission in the internal shock model .",
    "these authors addressed a set of questions such as the ability of synchrotron / ssc in internal shocks to produce a spectral peak near 100 kev , the observed flux in the @xmath0-ray band , and short time scale variability . @xcite and @xcite realized that the cooling time scale for electrons ( compared to the dynamical time ) for internal shocks is short and although @xcite do nt explicitly say , their work applies to grbs with @xmath132 .",
    "@xcite look at composite synchrotron / ssc spectra , however there are many free parameters and little comparison to observed properties of grbs . had these authors investigated the self - consistency of synchrotron internal - shock model for the case of @xmath131 , they would have discovered the problem reported in this paper using their _ forward modeling _ approach .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) did in fact worry about synchrotron solutions when @xmath394 and concluded that it is impossible to account for it in shock based models ( this is paraphrasing their actual wordings ) .",
    "they pointed out that electron cooling time , during prompt emission , is much smaller than the dynamical time [ as was reported in @xcite and @xcite ] and therefore the grb spectrum below the peak should be always @xmath8 if the radiation is produced via synchrotron process",
    ". ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) considered the possibility that a lower strength magnetic field would avoid the excessive cooling of electrons , and rejected it based on the argument that ic emission would dominate in this case i.e. , @xmath675 , and that ic spectrum too would be falling of as @xmath8 or steeper due to ic cooling .",
    "we find that a smaller magnetic field can avoid excessive cooling , so that @xmath131 , and at the same time compton @xmath676 .",
    "the reason for these different conclusions is that we do nt impose any restriction on the source distance that _ forward calculations _",
    "based on internal shocks do .",
    "the most serious problem with synchrotron @xmath131 case is that @xmath190 unless @xmath677 @xmath6 ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) correctly pointed out that re - acceleration of electrons , in shock based models , would not work because it requires too much energy ; one has a continuous stream of electrons crossing the shock front  and to accelerate all of these electrons to their original energy distribution , so that @xmath131 , while they are rapidly losing energy to radiation will indeed require much more energy than is available in the shock .",
    "the re - acceleration invoked in this work is not shock based .",
    "it in fact requires abandoning shock models and considering a scenario where particles are not being added to the  system \"  the source for @xmath0-ray photons  continuously ( as in shock based models ) but where the source has a fixed number of particles that are being continuously accelerated ; there is no excessive energy problem in this scenario .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the generation of @xmath0-rays in gamma - ray bursts via synchrotron or synchrotron - self - inverse - compton ( ssc ) emissions in a relativistic outflow .",
    "the ssc radiation from a relativistic source can be fully described by a set of 5 parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath18 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) ; see table 1 for definition of symbols used in the paper . for each possible low energy spectral index , we have analytically and numerically determined the region of the 5-d parameter space that is consistent with a set of grb observations ",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 , & @xmath25 . for these allowed regions  or _",
    "solution _ sub - space  we calculate the x - ray and optical fluxes that should be seen concurrent with the @xmath0-ray radiation to further narrow down the properties of @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the set of five parameters also allows us to determine the distance of the source from the center of explosion ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we find that if @xmath0-ray emission were to be produced via the synchrotron process , the required set of parameters and burst radius have extreme values that are not internally consistent and are in conflict with afterglow data .",
    "in particular , when the low energy spectrum is @xmath250 or @xmath678 , the lorentz factor of the source is required to be larger than @xmath560 , in disagreement with afterglow modeling , and the source distance ( @xmath1 ) is larger than the deceleration radius even when the density of the medium is as small as @xmath679 @xmath6 . the requirement on the magnetic field strength is also very stringent ; the comoving field strength is required to lie in a very narrow range of about @xmath68030 gauss in order to explain the radiation for a typical burst as synchrotron emission . allowing for the possibility of multiple electron acceleration episodes ,",
    "i.e. @xmath217 , alleviates the problem of large @xmath1 & @xmath18 ; in this scenario the synchrotron process could account for the prompt @xmath0-ray radiation for grbs ( see  3.1 & 3.2 ) although @xmath1 is still larger than the source distance determined for a subset of bursts detected by swift ( kumar et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the reason that synchrotron solutions with @xmath133 & 1/3 require large @xmath1 & @xmath18 is easy to understand . the number of electrons needed to produce the observed flux via the synchrotron process is @xmath681 . and in order to keep the compton - y parameter ( @xmath682 ) less than @xmath234  otherwise most of the energy will come out in ic - scattered photons at @xmath235 1 gev  the source must have small @xmath17 or large @xmath1 . moreover , since @xmath683 , large @xmath1 solutions also have large @xmath18 for a given grb pulse width of @xmath25 .",
    "the reason that @xmath217 offers a way out of this problem is also easy to understand . frequent re - acceleration of charge particles makes it possible to have larger magnetic field while keeping @xmath236 kev .",
    "this decreases the number of particles required to produce the observed flux ( @xmath24 ) , and that in turn makes it possible to have a smaller @xmath1 .    for @xmath265 ,",
    "the allowed region of the 5-d parameter space for the synchrotron process is quite reasonable .",
    "however , interpreting these solutions in terms of the internal shock model requires the ratio of lfs of the two colliding shells to be rather large ( @xmath684 ) when the ratio of magnetic energy to electron energy is @xmath685 , i.e. if we want the energy fraction in electrons to be not too small  otherwise @xmath0-ray production would be very inefficient ( see  3.3 ) .",
    "the ssc process provides viable solutions for the prompt emission of a large fraction of grbs .",
    "we have considered almost all different possibilities of the low energy spectrum for grbs : @xmath530 below the peak of @xmath529 with @xmath686 .",
    "the solution space ( a hypersurface in the 5-d parameter space ) is quite large for @xmath395 and @xmath687 .",
    "however , there are no ssc solutions when @xmath452 ; the reason is that the synchrotron characteristic and cooling frequencies should be equal ( @xmath405 ) in order that @xmath131 , and in that case the synchrotron - self - absorption frequency is shown to be roughly equal to @xmath35 as well ( see  4.1.1 ) , and therefore the low energy spectral index is @xmath526 and not @xmath688 as desired .",
    "the ssc solution space for @xmath395 and @xmath689 has source lf of order 100 , the minimum electron energy @xmath690 ( characteristic of mildly relativistic shocks ) , and @xmath691 cm is smaller than the deceleration radius .",
    "these solutions are accompanied by bright optical synchrotron flux of @xmath680 mjy ( 14@xmath587 mag ) to several hundred mjy for bursts at @xmath10 ",
    "brightest for bursts with @xmath692 and those bursts with pulse duration on the order of @xmath693s . moreover , the optical flux is correlated with @xmath1  the flux is larger for larger @xmath1  and for @xmath694 ( cf .",
    "kumar et al .",
    "2007 ) , the optical flux is @xmath474100mjy ( @xmath695 mag ) .",
    "bright optical flux contemporaneous with @xmath0-rays is a prediction of the ssc model that is in conflict with prompt optical follow up observations of a large number of bursts detected by swift ( roming et al .",
    "2006).-ray observations for a few bursts show bright optical flares .",
    "for example , grb 041219a was observed in optical and ir simultaneously with @xmath0-rays @xcite ; the optical flux peaked at 13.7 magnitude at approximately the same time as the first main pulse of the grb lightcurve ( as expected for the ssc model ) , and ir measurements @xcite show evidence of rapid variability with the last spikes in the grb light curve .",
    "grb 990123 , with a positive @xmath27 , had a peak optical flux during the burst of @xmath526jy @xcite , however the optical lightcurve was not correlated with the @xmath0-ray lightcurve .",
    "] we note that the large optical flux accompanying @xmath0-rays can be reduced only if each radiating electron is accelerated numerous times ( @xmath696 ) in time period of order the duration of a pulse in the grb lightcurve , i.e. @xmath515 .",
    "grb models based on converting kinetic energy to radiation via shocks have @xmath184 , where particles are accelerated at the shock - front and not down - stream , but continuous particle acceleration might work for some alternate scenarios such as magnetic field reconnection / dissipation . magnetic outflow model for grbs",

    "however , the model has not been developed to the extend where it can be tested with grb observations .",

    "the radiation efficiency in the grb band for the shell collision is then @xmath729 .    when considering synchrotron radiation as the primary source of emission in the @xmath0-ray band we need to take into account the energy fraction that is lost to very high energy photons ( @xmath730 kev ) produced via the inverse - compton process .",

    "using our upper limit on @xmath302 , we also calculate the expected emission from the shell 2 in the x - ray and optical bands , and include this in our analysis .",
    "a radiation mechanism , called jitter radiation , has been suggested by @xcite as the process for @xmath0-ray emission for those cases where the low energy spectrum rises more steeply than @xmath445 expected of the synchrotron radiation ( such spectra are said to lie  above the line of death \" because a non - self - absorbed synchrotron spectrum can not have this steep of a rise ) .",
    "the jitter radiation is produced when the coherence length scale for magnetic field is short and electron trajectory is perturbed before it has traveled a distance of a larmor radius .",
    "this is an attractive idea for explaining a class of grbs lying above the line of death , and we explore its applicability to grbs in this appendix .    the peak jitter frequency in lab frame ( as seen by an observer at rest in the host galaxy ) is : @xmath748 where @xmath70 is electron charge , @xmath18 is the bulk lorentz factor ( lf ) of the source , @xmath749 , @xmath31 is the thermal lf of electrons that cool on a dynamical time , @xmath20 is the minimum thermal lf of electrons behind the shock front ( note that @xmath750 ; where @xmath33 is the lf of the shock front wrt the unshocked shell ) , @xmath59 is the comoving electron density in the unshocked shell , and @xmath751  4 is the initial effective thermal lorentz factor of the streaming electrons .    in order to get the gamma - ray burst spectrum below the peak to be proportional to @xmath752 , we want @xmath753 ev ( the peak of the grb spectrum is of order 100 kev ) .",
    "therefore , from the above equation we find the following condition on comoving electron density in the unshocked shell : @xmath754 or the optical depth of the source to thomson scattering is : @xmath755 where @xmath1 is the distance of the source from the center of the explosion , and @xmath756 is the grb variability time scale .    for internal shock",
    "@xmath33 is of order a few , and therefore , @xmath757 . in this case",
    "we find the optical depth of the source to be @xmath758 or @xmath759 for @xmath760 sec , and @xmath761 .",
    "the next step is to estimate the lf of cooling electrons ( @xmath31 ) , which can be shown to be : @xmath762 where b is the magnetic field in the source co - moving frame , and y is the compton - y - parameter ; @xmath763 ( for @xmath764 ) .",
    "if @xmath31 is not much less than @xmath20 then y is very large ( of order a million ) , and most of the radiation energy will come out as ssc photons at @xmath765 gev . and moreover , electrons cool very rapidly resulting in the synchrotron cooling frequency ( @xmath32 ) to be much less than 100 kev , and therefore the spectrum below the peak will be @xmath8 and not @xmath766 . even if we take @xmath31 to be order unity , we still run into similar problems ."
