    "the most important breakthrough for coded modulation ( cm ) in fading channels came in 1992 , when zehavi introduced the so - called bit - interleaved coded modulation ( bicm ) @xcite , usually referred to as a pragmatic approach for cm @xcite . despite",

    "geometrical shaping was studied in @xcite , and probabilistic shaping , i.e. , varying the probabilities of the bit streams , was first proposed in @xcite and developed further in @xcite .",
    "probabilistic shaping offers another degree of freedom in the bicm design , which can be used to make the discrete input distribution more similar to the optimal distribution ( which is in general unknown ) .",
    "this is particularly advantageous at low and medium snr .",
    "for the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , the so - called shannon limit ( sl ) @xmath0 represents the average bit energy - to - noise ratio needed to transmit information reliably when the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) tends to zero @xcite , i.e. , in the wideband regime . when discrete input alphabets are considered at the transmitter and a bicm decoder is used at the receiver , the sl is not always achieved as first noticed in @xcite .",
    "this was later shown to be caused by the selection of the binary labeling @xcite .",
    "the behavior of bicm in the wideband regime was studied in @xcite as a function of the alphabet ( @xmath1 ) and the binary labeling ( @xmath2 ) , _ assuming a uniform input distribution_. first - order optimal ( foo ) constellations were defined in @xcite as the triplet @xmath3 $ ] that make a bicm system achieve the sl , where @xmath4 represents the input distribution .    in this paper ,",

    "more particularly , the geometrical and/or probabilistic shaping rules that should be applied to a constellation to make it foo are found .",
    "the main conclusion is that probabilistic shaping offers no extra degrees of freedom in addition to what is provided by geometrical shaping for bicm in the wideband regime .",
