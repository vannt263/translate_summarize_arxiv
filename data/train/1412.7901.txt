    "recent use of topology in condensed matter substantially revised our view on the characterization of materials especially for the gapped phases@xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of a topological view is robustness against continuous deformation .",
    "one can use a topological quantity to distinguish topological phases since the quantized nature of it guarantees its invariance against continuous deformation @xcite . due to the theorem by von neumann - wigner ,",
    "however , truly generic phase can be a single class since any generic states can be adiabatically connected .",
    "then , the symmetry restriction is essential .",
    "the symmetry can be gauge symmetry , time - reversal , particle - hole , reflection , etc@xcite .",
    "when these restrictions give rise to a new nontrivial phase , it is a symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phase .",
    "a typical spt order parameter is the berry phase , which takes any value without symmetry , but can be quantized with the appropriate symmetry .",
    "the continuous deformation , or adiabatic continuation , is also essential for establishing the bulk",
    " edge correspondence@xcite , which is one of the fundamental concepts for characterizing topological phases .",
    "physics at the bulk and the edges are not independent and related each other especially for the gapped case .",
    "introduction of a boundary sometimes breaks symmetries of the bulk system , but sometimes does not . from the viewpoint of the symmetry protection , whether the edge respects a bulk symmetry or not has a special importance .    in this paper , topological properties of a dimerized spin-1/2 heisenberg ladder with antiferromagnetic coupling",
    "is investigated focusing on the plateau phase at half of the saturation , which we call a 1/2-plateau phase .",
    "the 1/2-plateau phase appears in the applied magnetic field , which breaks most of the symmetry of the system .",
    "the ladder model itself has been studied extensively@xcite , and some of the studies shed lights on the topological aspects of the ladder model@xcite , but the focus was mainly on the case without magnetic field .",
    "( very recently , plateau phases at finite magnetization in spin chains are studied by a spt viewpoint in ref .  . )",
    "a main purpose of this paper is to show the 1/2-plateau phase here is a spt phase protected by the spatial inversion symmetry that survives even with the finite external magnetic field .",
    "the berry phase and the entanglement entropy are employed to characterize a spt phase .",
    "as we will explain later , boundary shapes are essential for both of the berry phase and the entanglement entropy , and the boundary that keeps the inversion symmetry is mainly used not to destroy the symmetry effects .",
    "importance of the symmetry is also demonstrated by introducing artificial symmetry breaking , and by a spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by a ring exchange .",
    "we further study edge states to establish the bulk  edge correspondence . in order to complement the above arguments , a boundary that breaks inversion symmetry is also treated .",
    "naively , one may think that such a symmetry breaking boundary is not useful for characterizing symmetry protected topological phases .",
    "however , for a specific type of symmetry breaking boundary , we found a unique quantization of the berry phase , i.e. , a fractional quantization of the berry phase into @xmath3 , instead of the widely observed 0/@xmath2-quantization .",
    "further , it is shown that edge states are also unique for the @xmath3-quantization case : there appear `` polarized '' edge state such that up and down spins are localized at the opposite ends of the finite system .",
    "the applied magnetic field is essential for achieving the fractional quantization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : model_methods ] , a model hamiltonian and physical quantities used in our topological characterization are introduced . then , the numerical methods to obtain those physical quantities , the exact diagonalization and the infinite time - evolving block decimation@xcite ( itebd ) , are explained .",
    "there , we also explain how the topological character of the system is encoded in the matrix product state , in terms of the transformation law against the symmetry operation .",
    "section  [ sec : results_discussions ] contains main results of this paper .",
    "first , the magnetization curve is shown to take a glance at the plateau phase on which we focus in this paper .",
    "after that , the topological properties of the 1/2-plateau phase , such as the quantized berry phase and the bulk - edge correspondence are discussed in detail .",
    "the effects of ring exchange is also considered .",
    "finally , we make a comparison between the 0-plateau phase and the 1/2-plateau phase .",

    "a parameter @xmath6 is introduced as @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , the minimum unit cell is composed of four spins ,",
    "while if @xmath9 , it is composed of two .",
    "this unit cell structure is essential to obtain the 1/2-plateau phase@xcite that we concentrate on .",
    "when @xmath10 , the system has the rotational symmetry in the spin space and the time reversal symmetry , but those symmetries are broken for finite @xmath11 . however , even with finite @xmath11 , the system retains the spatial inversion symmetry , which is essential for protecting the topological phase in the 1/2-plateau phase .        in order to elucidate the topological properties of the model",
    ", we calculate the magnetization , the berry phase , and the entanglement entropy .",
    "the magnetization is calculated to show the existence of the plateau phase .",
    "the berry phase defined below works as a symmetry protected topological order parameter to identify two topologically distinct states having the same symmetry@xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy for the spatial bipartition is evaluated to check whether the two states can be smoothly connected or not .",
    "also the entanglement entropy gives a picture of the bulk - edge correspondence because the topological character of the system is encoded in the entanglement spectrum@xcite , and the entanglement entropy contains a contribution from the edge states@xcite .",
    "analysis based on the transformation law of the matrices in the matrix product state ( mps ) representation is also performed to complement the berry phase based arguments , i.e. , we extract a topological order parameter other than the quantized berry phase from the mps representation .",
    "in addition , by making use of the translationally invariant mps representation that enables us to access the thermodynamic limit , we can discuss the collapse of the spt phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the calculations of the berry phase and the investigation of the edge states are performed by the exact diagonalization of the finite size system .",
    "the ground state energy and the wave function are numerically evaluated by the lanczos algorithm combined with the inverse iteration method . in order to define the berry phase",

    "however , as far as the berry phase is quantized due to some symmetry , as we will see soon later , there is practically no size effect on the numerically obtained berry phases .    in order to obtain the entanglement entropy and the mps ,",
    "the itebd method is employed@xcite . in the itebd",
    ", a translationally invariant mps representation of the ground state is iteratively obtained .",
    "it becomes exact in the large @xmath23 limit , where @xmath23 is truncation dimension corresponding to the dimension of the matrix in the mps representation .",
    "for gapped phases , small @xmath23 is sufficient to obtain results in practical precision .",
    "an advantage of the itebd is accessibility to the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , it is free from the finite size effect , because it provides a translationally invariant mps representation by construction .",
    "the finite size effect free nature is essential for discussing spontaneous symmetry breaking . to perform the itebd , translation symmetry is essential , and the target system is assumed to be composed of repetition of unit objects .",
    "then , the itebd naturally gives entanglement entropy for the bipartition such that the system is divided into two parts in between the two neighboring unit objects . in the following",
    ", unit objects are appropriately chosen so as to make a given boundary in between two of them . in this way , the entanglement entropy depends on shapes of given boundary as it should do .    with the itebd ,",
    "it is possible to obtain the translationally invariant canonical mps representation@xcite of the state such that @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the labels of local states , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath28 matrices .",
    "@xmath27 is a diagonal matrix whose entries are nonnegative , and related to the entanglement entropy @xmath29 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the diagonal elements of @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath32 respects some symmetry , @xmath26 must react against the symmetry operation appropriately .",
    "then , physical states with the same symmetry can be classified by this transformation law of @xmath26 .",

    "mathematically , @xmath36 gives a projective representation of the symmetry operation , and the states are distinguished by its factor set@xcite .",
    "if the operation involves the spatial inversion symmetry , which plays a central role in this paper , @xmath34 at the left hand side of eq .   is replaced by @xmath38 that is the transpose of @xmath34@xcite , since the inversion operation reverses the order of @xmath25 . in general , a cyclic group generated by a single element , like the case that there is only inversion symmetry , leads no interesting factor set .",
    "however , this transposition makes the inversion symmetry useful in classification of the states .",
    "namely , there is a restriction on @xmath36 for the spatial inversion symmetry ( denoted as @xmath39 hereafter ) such that @xmath40 , which means that @xmath39 should be symmetric or antisymmetric@xcite . for antisymmetric @xmath39 , the relation @xmath41=0",
    "$ ] gives degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum , in which the topological properties of the system is encoded@xcite .",

    "the essential features of the curves are consistent with those in ref .  .",
    "namely , there are two plateau phases , for @xmath61 ( 0-plateau ) and @xmath62 ( 1/2-plateau ) .",
    "the width of the 1/2-plateau depends on the strength of the dimerization @xmath6 .",
    "if there is no dimerization , the unit cell contains only two sublattices , and the plateau at @xmath63 , which is a half of the saturation magnetization , is not allowed . on the other hand ,",
    "the 0-plateau phase does not vanish in the zero dimerization limit .",
    "this is natural because the 0-plateau phase without dimerization is actually in the rung singlet phase@xcite , and the rung singlet is expected to be stable for small dimerization .",
    "let us move on to the topological properties of the 1/2-plateau phase .",
    "figures .",
    "[ fig : type1](a ) and [ fig : type1](b ) show the numerically obtained berry phase and entanglement entropy for the 1/2-plateau phase .",

    "( later we will discuss the edge states and then the diagonal edge is also used . )",
    "what is important is that the vertical edge does not break the inversion symmetry whose inversion center is at the boundary .",

    "[ fig : type1](b ) .",
    "this quantization is caused by the spatial inversion symmetry@xcite . here",
    ", the inversion symmetry means that the hamiltonian with the gauge twist @xmath16 satisfies @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an appropriate unitary matrix .",

    "this phase transition is also detected by the entanglement entropy as its divergent behavior .     as a function of @xmath6 for the vertical edge .",
    "the entanglement entropy is calculated with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the berry phase is obtained with the @xmath62 sector in the six unit cell ( 24 spins ) system .",
    "@xmath43 is calculated with @xmath70 . ]",
    "analysis of the transformation law of @xmath26 also supports this conclusion .",
    "in fact , as is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : type1](c ) , @xmath43 is 1 for @xmath71 and @xmath46 for @xmath72 , which confirms that the both states respect the spatial inversion symmetry , but are topologically distinct from each other . for @xmath72 ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is always larger than @xmath42 , due to the double degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum that is associated with @xmath73 .",
    "importantly , @xmath73 is found in the phase with @xmath74 , which implies consistency between @xmath17 and @xmath43 as a topological order parameter .",
    "since we are considering the finite @xmath11 case , the time reversal symmetry and the rotational symmetry in spin space can not be used here .    for this classification of the phases , choice of the position of the boundary",
    "is essential because the states with @xmath72 and that with @xmath71 are equivalent by a single site translation of the whole system .",
    "this means that the observed transition is similar to that of the su - schrieffer - heeger model@xcite , or of the dimerized spin-1/2 heisenberg chain@xcite .",
    "a relation to the dimerized chain is understood by considering the strong rung coupling limit , though our calculation so far assumes the comparable rung and leg couplings .",
    "the spin-1/2 ladder in the strong rung coupling limit at @xmath62 is effectively described by a xxz chain model at _ zero _ magnetization with easy plane anisotropy@xcite .",

    "no significant change of the local magnetization is found in the bulk part . on the other hand , for @xmath81",
    ", the ground state magnetization exactly satisfies @xmath62 , and the local magnetization is only weakly affected at the boundary .",
    "these behaviors are clearly explained in the @xmath89 limit , i.e. , the decoupled limit . in this limit",

    "a cluster at the boundary is broken , and the lowest energies of the broken cluster at each magnetization are obtained as @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 ( @xmath62 ) , and @xmath95 ( @xmath61 ) . in the present case , @xmath58 and @xmath96 , the fully polarized state ( @xmath97 )",
    "is chosen at the boundary , which indicates that the extra up spin is localized at the boundary .",
    "the @xmath88 cases are adiabatically connected to the case with @xmath89 .",
    "existence of the edge states is also reflected in the entanglement entropy .",

    "first , the berry phase for the diagonal edge in the 1/2-plateau phase is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : type2 ] .",
    "there , we can see that the berry phase is quantized into @xmath3 , that is , the berry phase shows the unique fractional quantization@xcite .",
    "this fractional quantization obeys from the formula @xmath103 derived in the similar way as in refs .   or .",
    "since @xmath104 is quantized into 0 or @xmath2 by the spatial inversion symmetry , and @xmath105 is fixed to 1/4 owing to the symmetry of the model , @xmath106 is quantized into @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : type2](b ) indicates that the topological phase transition is captured as a jump in @xmath17 since the bulk symmetry is kept , but 0/@xmath2-quantization is broken because of the symmetry breaking boundary .    the entanglement entropy is also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : type2 ] .",
    "different from the case of 0/@xmath2 quantization , the entanglement entropy is finite in the both of the positive and negative sides of the @xmath98 limit . as in the case of the vertical edge",

    "( see appendix  [ appendix ] ) .",
    "although the topological phase transition is detected as a diverging behavior due to the bulk nature of the entanglement entropy , degeneracy of the entanglement entropy originating from the inversion symmetry does not take place for the symmetry breaking boundary and we have a situation that the entanglement entropy becomes smaller than @xmath42 , for instance , @xmath108 .",

    "these features give a physical picture of the @xmath3-quantization .",

    "[ fig : site_resolved ] corresponds to the electronically polarized state associated with the finite berry phase .",
    "note that @xmath74 represents the situation where the mean position of the electrons is at the middle point between two lattice points , which means that there is no electronic polarization even though the berry phase is finite .",

    "the ladder structure and the applied magnetic field are essential .",
    "first of all , the ladder structure allows us to consider the diagonal edge for which the fractional quantization is achieved .",
    "further , eq .   implies that we need to look at the plateau phase with @xmath62 to have the fractional quantization .",
    "although the plateau phase under consideration can be mapped to the zero magnetization phase in the xxz chain in the strong rung coupling limit , the fractional quantization is not expected in the xxz chain since it does not admit the diagonal edge .",
    "so far , we have considered the 1/2-plateau phase induced by the dimerization . for the uniform case without dimerization ,",
    "a plateau phase at the same magnetization @xmath62 is induced by a ring exchange@xcite , which is written as@xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) is an operator acting on the minimal four - site plaquette that causes a clockwise ( anticlockwise ) shift of the spins on that plaquette .",
    "that is , if we denote the states of four spins on a plaquette as @xmath114 , @xmath112 operates as @xmath115 intuitive understanding of the ring exchange is possible for the strong rung coupling limit .",
    "there , we have noted that the model is effectively described by a xxz chain model .",
    "the ring exchange term modifies the anisotropy of the effective xxz model , i.e. , the anisotropy is modified from the easy plane type to the easy axis type ( ising type ) for sufficiently large positive @xmath116 .",
    "then , the antiferromagnetic order is developed in the effective model , and this ordered phase corresponds to the 1/2-plateau phase in the original model@xcite . due to the antiferromagnetic nature of the state , the spatial inversion symmetry that is essential for the spt phase is broken .",
    "then , a transition between the spt phase and the symmetry broken phase _ within the 1/2-plateau phase _ is expected when the strength of the ring exchange is suitably tuned .",

    "[ fig : ring ] confirms this idea .",
    "namely , @xmath121 gets finite at a certain value of @xmath77 as @xmath77 increases , while @xmath122 is always 0.5 .    in order to clarify the difference between zero @xmath121 phase and finite @xmath121 phase in terms of spt , the entanglement spectra for @xmath123 and @xmath124",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] .",
    "we did not use the berry phase since it requires a finite size system for calculation , which means that it is difficult to treat the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking . here",
    ", we only use the vertical edges . still , there are two choices of the vertical edges , one breaks @xmath125 bonds and the other breaks @xmath126 bonds .",
    "therefore , for each value of @xmath77 , two spectra are plotted . at @xmath123 ,",
    "we observe double degeneracy of the spectrum for the edge on @xmath126 bonds .",
    "this degeneracy stems from the nontrivial projective representation , @xmath73 , and signals a spt phase . on the other hand , for @xmath127 ,",
    "neither of the edges on @xmath125 and @xmath126 bonds leads to the degeneracy of the spectra .",
    "these observation implies that the transition in fig .",
    "[ fig : ring ] is a typical and concrete example for collapse of the spt phase by a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "and @xmath121 obtained with @xmath68 and @xmath128 .",
    "insets show the entanglement spectra for @xmath123 and @xmath124 . for each value of @xmath77 ,",
    "the left column is for the edge on @xmath125 bond , and the right column is for the edge on @xmath126 bond . ]      finally , we briefly discuss the 0-plateau phase near zero magnetic field . in this case",
    "there is no sign of the phase transition in both of the berry phases and the entanglement entropy plotted as a function of @xmath6 ( not shown ) .",
    "this is natural because @xmath9 state is not critical but described as a rung singlet state@xcite without the zeeman field .",
    "in contrast , the dimerized _ chain _ is critical when @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , actually , there is no jump at @xmath9 in the berry phase as a function of @xmath6 , even in the small rung coupling limit .",
    "this is because we apply gauge twists on _ all _ bonds across the boundary .",
    "then , even for @xmath6 for which a topologically nontrivial phase is expected in the dimerized _ chain _ , the berry phase is 0 for the dimerized ladder because each chain contributes @xmath2 to @xmath17 , which results in @xmath129 ( mod @xmath67 ) .",
    "if we apply different kinds of gauge twist , not limited to the one that is possible to be reduced to a twisted boundary condition , it is possible to detect dimer structures@xcite .",
    "we have also confirmed the absence of the topological phase protected by the spatial inversion symmetry in 0-plateau phase by the mps representation .",
    "that is , in the 0-plateau phase , @xmath43 is always 1 irrespective of the sign of @xmath6 .",
    "to summarize , it is established that there is a symmetry protected topological phase in the 1/2-plateau phase in the dimerized spin-1/2 heisenberg ladder .",
    "even with the magnetic field , which is necessary to access the 1/2-plateau phase and reduces the symmetry of the system , the spatial inversion symmetry remains and protects the topological phase .",
    "namely , the inversion symmetry makes the berry phase quantized into @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and allow us to regard the berry phase as a topological order parameter .",
    "the entanglement entropy is also used to characterize the topological phase . in order to complement the berry phase based arguments",
    ", the topological order parameter other than the berry phase is extracted from the mps representation of the state . that topological order parameter determines the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum , and gives lower bound of the entanglement entropy .",
    "the importance of the symmetry is demonstrated by introducing a symmetry breaking term and by spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the ring exchange .",
    "because of the importance of the inversion symmetry , the boundary that respects the inversion symmetry is mainly used to define the berry phase and the entanglement entropy .",
    "however , our analysis on a specific shape of boundary reveals that the symmetry breaking boundary can lead to a new type of the bulk  edge correspondence . in specific ,",
    "we find a fractional quantization of the berry phase into @xmath3 for such a symmetry breaking boundary .",
    "further it is shown that there are unique edge states , which shows polarization , i.e. , up and down spins are accumulated at the opposite ends of the finite system , for the case with @xmath3-quantization .",
    "this finding implies new possible applications of the berry phase for exploring the topological properties of given systems .",
    "for instance , the idea of the fractional quantization of the berry phase will have some applications also in two- or three - dimensional systems in the magnetic fields .",
    "other types of the fractional quantization can be possible for the different plateau phases .",

    "for a four - site plaquette with @xmath62 , there are four basis states written as @xmath130 the hamiltonian of the plaquette acts on these basis states as @xmath131 if @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the ground state is obtained as @xmath134      for a given bipartition , a state is expressed as @xmath135 where each of @xmath136 and @xmath137 is a state in either part of the bipartitioned system . using the singular value decomposition ,",
    "a matrix @xmath138 can be always written as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a diagonal matrix whose elements are nonnegative , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 are unitary matrices .",
    "then , @xmath143 is rewritten as @xmath144 with @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the diagonal elements of @xmath140 .",
    "first , we consider the vertical edge that breaks a four site plaquette into two parts with two spins . taking a set @xmath148 as @xmath136 and @xmath149",
    ", @xmath150 can be written in the form as eq .   with @xmath138 being @xmath151 then , it is straightforward to confirm that @xmath141 , @xmath152 , and @xmath140 for this case become @xmath153 and @xmath154 as a result , we have @xmath155    next ,",
