    "finite volume methods have been widely used in computational fluid dynamics for a long time ; they are well adapted to the discretization of partial differential equations under conservative form ; one of their attractive features is that the resulting discretized equation has a clear physical interpretation @xcite . in the framework of incompressible fluid flows ,",
    "two strategies are often opposed , namely staggered and collocated schemes .",
    "the staggered strategy , which has become very popular since patankar s book @xcite , remains mainly restricted to geometrical domains with parallel and orthogonal boundary faces .",
    "therefore , for computations on complex domains with general meshes , the collocated strategy which consists in approximating all unknowns on the same set of points ( called collocation points but also cell centers or simply centers ) , is often preferred , even though the pressure - velocity coupling demands some cure for the stabilization of the well - known checkerboard pressure modes ; to this purpose , various pressure stabilization procedures , based on improvements of the _ momentum interpolation method _ proposed by rhie and chow @xcite , are frequently used @xcite . + in @xcite , a collocated finite volume scheme for incompressible flows",
    "is developed on so called  admissible \" unstructured meshes , that are meshes satisfying the two following conditions : the straight line joining the centers of two adjacent control volumes is perpendicular to the common edge , and the neighboring control volumes and the associated centers are arranged in the same order , with respect to the common edge .",
    "rectangular or orthogonal parallelepipedic meshes , triangular ( 2d ) or tetrahedral ( 3d ) delaunay meshes , and voronoi meshes fulfill these requirements . under this assumption ,",
    "the isotropic diffusion fluxes can be consistently approximated by a two - point finite difference scheme .",
    "using this approximation for a pure diffusion problem yields a symmetric `` m - matrix '' ( which ensures monotony ) ; the stencil is limited to the control volume itself and its natural neighbors and it leads to the classical 5- and 7-point schemes on rectangles and orthogonal parallelepipeds .",
    "unfortunately , although the use of such grids considerably widens the variety of geometric shapes which can be gridded , it is far from solving all the critical needs resulting from actual problems :    * for complex 3d domains , it is well known that the use of a large number of flat tetrahedra produces high discretization errors ; generalized hexahedric meshes are often preferred : these are made of 3d elevations of quadrangular meshes , for which the faces of the control volumes may no longer be planar . * to our knowledge",
    ", there is yet no mesh software able to grid any geometrical shape in 3d using voronoi or delaunay tessellations while respecting the boundaries and the local refinement requirements . * in compressible flows ,",
    "the approximation of the full tensor by the usual two point scheme is no longer consistent even on admissible meshes ; multi - point approximations are therefore required . *",
    "boundary layers are classically meshed with refined grids , so that the discretization scheme should be able to deal with non - conforming meshes .    whereas there is no real difficulty to discretize the convective terms for general non - conforming grids , writing accurate diffusion approximations , particularly relevant for low reynolds ( pclet ) flows , is still a challenge on such meshes .",
    "+ in the early 80 s , kershaw @xcite first proposed a nine - point scheme on structured quadrilateral grids by using the restrictive assumption of a smooth mapping between the logical mesh and the spatial coordinates . since then , numerous works have been published to efficiently solve the diffusion equations in general geometry ( see @xcite for a review of recent papers ) .",
    "the drawbacks of the actual schemes for diffusion are often linked with one or several of these key points :    * a non - local stencil ( quite dense matrices ) ; * cell - centered but also face - centered unknowns ( large matrices ) ; * non - symmetric definite positive matrices ( loss of the energy balance ) ; * loss of the convergence or of the accuracy on some particular grids ; * loss of monotony for solutions in purely diffusive problems ( the resulting matrix is not an `` m - matrix '' ) .",
    "we focus in this paper on the approximation of the navier - stokes and energy equations under the boussinesq assumption , using a new scheme for diffusion terms .",
    "this scheme is shown to provide a cell - centered approximation with a quite reduced stencil , leading to symmetric definite positive matrices and allowing a mathematical proof of convergence .",
    "although the diffusion matrix may not be shown to be an m - matrix in the general case , the maximum principle is nevertheless preserved in our numerical three - dimensional simulations . in this scheme , the discrete pressure gradient and the non - linear contributions",
    "are approximated so that the discrete kinetic and energy balances mimic their continuous counterparts .",
    "indeed , the pressure gradient is chosen as the dual operator of the discrete divergence , and the discretization is such that there is no contribution of the non - linear velocity transport in the increase of kinetic energy . in order to suppress the pressure checkerboard modes ,",
    "the mass balance is stabilized by a pressure term which only redistributes the fluid mass within subsets of control volumes , the characteristic size of which is two or three times the local mesh size .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is divided into four sections . in section 2 ,",
    "the continuous formulation is presented in the framework of free convection .",
    "section 3 presents the discrete scheme for general non - conforming meshes , with illustrations in the simplified case of uniform rectangular grids , and some mathematical properties .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the numerical validation , first with analytical solutions and then with a classical natural convection problem .",

    "unlike the previous mesh , which consists in hexahedra with plane faces , the four edges of a face are now not included in a same plane , with the exception of edges which belong to the boundaries of the cubic domain . since the consistency of the discrete gradient defined in ( and therefore of that defined in ) holds if the faces @xmath78 are plane , we replace each of the non planar faces by two triangular faces .",

    "another velocity reference should be used , based on the viscous diffusivity ) .",
    "table  ( [ tab : slopes_nvstks ] ) indicates that the convergence rates of the velocity components are larger than @xmath308 on the three finer meshes when the relative error is based on the @xmath279-norm and first order accurate for the pressure for distorted meshes . in accordance with the diffusion problem when the @xmath278-norm is used ,",
    "the orders of convergence slightly decrease for the velocity but a convergence rate larger than @xmath309 is still measured .",

    "unsurprisingly , the @xmath278 and @xmath280-norms of the pressure do not tend to zero with the mesh size because it simply appears in the momentum equation as lagrangian multiplier of the mass equation .",

    "the cubic meshes , the relative differences with respect to reference data seem to tend to zero : for the finer mesh , our results depart from less than @xmath319 with respect to the reference values .",
    "although the solutions are less accurate for the shaken meshes , a convergent behavior is also observed .",
    "the relatively large differences measured on @xmath320 , in comparison with the other velocity components , are probably the result of the flow shape in which the main motion occurs in the @xmath321-planes with a small secondary flow in the transverse planes .",
    "it is also interesting to note the good accuracy of the average nusselt numbers .",
    "this accuracy is essentially obtained thanks to the use of the stabilized mass flux @xmath322 in the heat transport expression which ensures the conservation of the average heat flux balance on the boundaries of the cavity .",
    "in this paper we presented a new scheme which is well suited for the simulation of incompressible viscous flows on irregular and non - conforming grids . this possibility seems to open a large field of new applications ( grid refinement as a function of an _ a posteriori _ error computation , free boundaries ,  ) .",
