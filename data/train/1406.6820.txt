    "such maps play an important role in astrophysical constraints on @xmath0 gravity  @xcite , which can place much tighter constraint than what can be obtained from cosmological observations .",
    "nevertheless , there are some caveats before applying the conclusions made in this section to real galaxies . in the widely accepted picture",
    ", galaxies often form inside dark matter haloes , which are highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter field . to make the necessary connections",
    ", we will extend our analysis to dark matter haloes in the next section .",
    "from the previous analysis , we know that the screening in @xmath0 gravity depends mainly on the depth of the gravitational potential . from the condition @xmath192 , we can infer that there are two possible ways for a dark matter halo to be screened .",
    "firstly , the halo itself is so massive that it can generate a deep enough potential well that satisfies @xmath197 : this case is dubbed _ self - screening _  @xcite .",
    "secondly , for a halo too small to be self - screened but lying in a very deep potential well , if the magnitude of the total local potential satisfies @xmath197 , then the halo can still become screened : this case is called _ environmental - screening _  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will discuss these two different screening scenarios in detail .",
    "we identify haloes in our simulations using a modified version of the ahf code  @xcite .",
    "we follow the standard procedure in the ahf code to locate density peaks as the positions of the dark matter haloes , but remove the unbound particles in haloes by taking into account the modification to gravity .",
    "we use the effective density @xmath198 instead of @xmath130 to calculate the gravitational potential . in order to characterise screened and unscreened dark matter haloes , we follow  @xcite by defining the lensing mass @xmath199 and dynamical mass @xmath200 for a dark matter halo .",
    "the lensing mass is the bare mass of the dark matter haloes , which is defined by @xmath201 the dynamic mass , on the other hand , is defined by @xmath202 which includes the effect of the scalar field . for a totally unscreened halo ,",
    "the ratio between the two masses is @xmath203 , while for a well screened halo we have @xmath204 . in general , however , the value of @xmath205 is somewhere in between .",
    "we now present our results for several representative models .",
    "show in figs .",
    "[ f4halo ] , [ f5halo ] , [ f6halo ] are the numerical results for the two @xmath0 models with @xmath152 at @xmath206 ( in fig .",
    "[ f4halo ] , note that we do not show the @xmath90 results for @xmath152 , because all haloes in this case are simply unscreened ) and the models with @xmath207 , @xmath208 at @xmath90 , respectively . in these figures ,",
    "each point represents a dark matter halo and the colour of the point describes the ratio between the dynamical mass and the lensing mass .",
    "we find the maximal value of the gravitational potential @xmath148 inside a dark matter halo and show @xmath209 $ ] with respect to the lensing mass of the said halo . for convenience ,",
    "the potential @xmath210 is in code units , and @xmath211 is the critical potential we have defined in the previous section . from these figures , we can see that if @xmath212 , the completely screened dark matter haloes ( @xmath213 ) only appear in potentials much deeper than the critical potential @xmath214 .",
    "it is also evident that below this critical potential , almost all the haloes are completely unscreened ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "these observations apply to both @xmath0 models under consideration and for different values of @xmath91 .",
    "next , we look at the two different ways of screening haloes as mentioned before .",
    "the efficiency of the screening depends on the depth of the potential well , @xmath215 . in the @xmath152 case , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4halo ] , the dark matter haloes , even the largest ones , can not generate a deep enough potential well for self - screening , and most of them are completely unscreened",
    ". however , we also see that there are several small haloes that are well screened . in these cases ,",
    "the screened haloes are environmentally screened , because they reside in deep potential wells generated by nearby structures . in order to confirm this point , in fig .",
    "[ f4haloesmall ] , we show the minimal values of the gravitational potential @xmath148 found inside dark matter haloes with respect to the lensing mass of the haloes . compared with fig .",
    "[ f4halo ] , for the large haloes , we find that although the maximal depth of the potential well ( @xmath209 $ ] ) inside the haloes is far above the critical potential , the minimal depth @xmath216 $ ] can be below it : the large haloes are therefore only partially screened , leading to @xmath217 . on the other hand , for the well - screened small haloes , from fig .  [ f4haloesmall ] , we can see that even the minimal depths of the potential inside the haloes are far above the critical potential ( see the blue points in fig .",
    "[ f4haloesmall ] ) : since the small haloes themselves could not produce such deep potentials , the latter should have been generated by their environments ( note that the results are unlikely to be noise as a halo normally contain at least hundreds of simulation particles ) .",
    "if the background field @xmath126 is small ( e.g. , @xmath208 ) , most haloes can generate relatively deeper potential wells than the small critical potential @xmath214 and thus easily be self - screened . from fig .",
    "[ f6halo ] , we find that all haloes more massive than about @xmath218 are well screened",
    ". however , not all the small haloes less massive than @xmath219 are unscreened .",
    "as explained in the above , there are a substantial fraction of the small haloes which are environmentally screened : as the critical potential @xmath220 is smaller for @xmath208 , there will be more regions in which nearby structures can create a potential well deeper than @xmath185 .",
    "further , statistically speaking , the screening level @xmath221 also depends on the depth of the potential well . in fig .",
    "[ screeing ] we show the distribution of @xmath221 with respect to @xmath222 and the maximal value of the gravitational potential , @xmath209 $ ] , of each halo .",
    "it is evident that the scatter of @xmath221 as functions of the potentials is much smaller than that of the halo masses .",
    "there are clear statistical transition features of haloes from being completely unscreened to being very well screened as the potential deepens .",
    "the transition is much sharper in @xmath208 than in @xmath207 , which is as expected given that the condition @xmath223 can be more easily satisfied in @xmath208 case .    in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ screeing ] , we show the screening level for isolated haloes with respect to lensing masses for @xmath207 and @xmath208 , respectively .",
    "the isolated halo is defined as a halo with no neighbours around , by @xmath224 in which @xmath225 is the position of a halo s centre and @xmath226 is its viral radius ; @xmath65 characterises the separation of haloes , and we take @xmath227 in this work . from the bottom row of fig.[screeing ] , it is clear that most of the isolated haloes are completely unscreened . in the @xmath208 case ,",
    "the screening level shows clear dependence on the halo mass , because for isolated haloes the screening is mainly self - screening , determined by the halo mass .",
    "so far , our analysis of the screening mechanism is based on comparing the local gravitational potential @xmath148 , to the value of the background field @xmath228 .",
    "the condition @xmath229 is useful for identifying unscreened haloes theoretically .",
    "however , in practice a global map of potential @xmath148 may not be easily constructed in real galaxy surveys , and we need to use the standard newtonian potential @xmath136 , namely the lensing potential , which is related to @xmath2 by eq .",
    "( [ nphi ] ) .",
    "there are two reasons for this :    * first , a global map of @xmath136 can be easily constructed in real galaxy surveys if a group catalog @xcite is available , because @xmath136 satisfies the linear equation , eq .",
    "( [ poissonn ] ) .",
    "@xmath2 , on the other hand , can not be reconstructed without solving the more complicated nonlinear scalar field equation . *",
    "second , measurements of galaxy shear also have the potential to reconstruct the 3-dimensional map of the lensing potential @xmath136 using weak lensing tomography @xcite .    as we have discussed in the previous section , for identifying the unscreened haloes , the condition @xmath230 is stronger than @xmath229 .",
    "let us now examine the power of the condition @xmath230 for identifying unscreened haloes . in fig .",
    "[ f6nhalo ] , we show the maximal value of the newtonian potential @xmath136 inside a halo ( @xmath231 $ ] ) with respect to the lensing mass of the halo for @xmath152 models at @xmath206 ( top panel ) and @xmath207 ( middle panel ) and @xmath208 ( bottom panel ) models at @xmath90 .",
    "the horizontal lines indicate the critical potentials for the newtonian potential @xmath136 , which is defined by @xmath232 we can see that @xmath233 is not very useful for identifying screened haloes .",

    "[ f6nhalo ] , not all haloes with @xmath235<|-\\phi_{nc}|$ ] are completely unscreened : several of them ( mainly the more massive ones ) are only partially unscreened . however , the condition @xmath234 in this case does distinguish unscreened haloes ( including partially unscreened ones ) from _ well - screened _ haloes ( dark blue points in fig .",
    "[ f6nhalo ] ) . in order to show this point , in fig .",
    "[ hisgram ] we present a histogram for the distribution of the well - screened dark haloes ( @xmath236 ) with respect to the maximal potential @xmath237 inside the halo .",

    "the chameleon screening plays an important role in the viability of @xmath0 gravity . in this paper , we have reexamined the screening in @xmath0 cosmology using a suite of @xmath65-body simulations and found a number of useful results , which are summarised as follows .    * in low - density regions , we find that the local curvature @xmath3 has a nonzero lower bound given by @xmath122 this conclusion applies to a large family of @xmath0 models that can closely mimic the @xmath5cdm background expansion regardless the functional form of @xmath0 .",
    "a practical application of this result is that the approximation for the scalar field @xmath42 only needs to be accurate in the range @xmath119 .",
    "* in high - density regions , we find an inequality @xmath239 that plays an important role in understanding the screening .",
    "we find that screening happens only if the depth of the local potential , @xmath148 , is close to or above the value of the background field , namely @xmath192 .",
    "however , this condition is not sufficient for all haloes to be well screened . on the other hand , we find that the opposite case , @xmath240 , can be reliably used to identify completely unscreened haloes in the simulations .",
    "+ to make connection between our results and real galaxy surveys , we have also expressed the condition in terms of the standard newtonian potential @xmath136 , or the lensing potential , which can be more straightforwardly inferred from observations .",
    "we show that @xmath241 is a stronger and more conservative criterion to find unscreened haloes .",
    "it works very well in the @xmath242 and @xmath243 cases , for which below the threshold potential @xmath244 all our dark matter haloes are completely unscreened . in the case of @xmath245 , although the criterion in eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) no longer guarantees that all the selected haloes are completely unscreened , it does cleanly separates unscreened haloes from the well - screened ones , and the contamination of the unscreened samples is very low .",
    "we point out that the way we separate self and environmental screenings of dark matter haloes is slightly different from some works in the literature .",
    "when talking about environmental screening , people often use a criterion similar to eq .",
    "( [ inequality ] ) , but with ( i ) @xmath246 replaced by its ` local ' version @xmath247 , where the subscript @xmath248 means that @xmath247 is the average over a region of size @xmath248 , usually assumed as comparable to the compton wavelength of @xmath42 , and ( ii ) @xmath136 taken as the newtonian potential _ generated by _ the object ( halo or galaxy ) being considered , instead of the total newtonian potential _ measured near _ the said object ( the latter could have contribution from nearby objects ) .",
    "our criterion is more directly related to observations , as we can only measure the total @xmath136 with gravitational lensing  if the latter is known , we know the total screening and the separation of self and environmental screening is of no practical interest .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath136 satisfies the usual superposition principle , while @xmath2 does not , and thus the use of @xmath136 makes it easier to estimate the contributions from environment ( neighbouring structures ) .",
    "although our conclusions are based on pure dark matter simulations , we would like to point out that the screening of a galaxy should be generally determined by the screening of the underling dark matter field since the baryon field only accounts for a small fraction of the total matter field on the scale of halos .",
    "state - of - the - art hydro simulations in the standard @xmath5cdm model , such as the eagle @xcite project , have led to clear pictures of the baryon distribution in dark matter haloes . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we assume that this picture also roughly holds for @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the baryon contribution to halo masses is just @xmath249 for haloes of @xmath250 , rising gradually to @xmath251% for haloes of @xmath252 .",
    "it is clear that the baryons only account for a small fraction of the halos mass and further only a small fraction of baryons come into the form of the stellar mass .    within dark matter haloes ,",
    "dark matter dominates the matter field when the radius is above @xmath253 halos radius @xmath254 , where the density profile is well described by the nfw profile . in the core part of the halo @xmath255",
    ", baryons would make up a significantly larger fraction of the total masses , at @xmath256 for haloes of @xmath257 . in this region , baryons are almost completely in the form of stars . although the total density profile in this region is deeper than nfw , using the fitting results of @xcite , we find that the baryons still contribute a sub - dominate fraction to a halo s own potential @xmath136 .",
    "it is about @xmath258 in haloes of @xmath259 , rising to @xmath260 for haloes of @xmath261 and then decrease to below @xmath262 for haloes of @xmath263 .",
    "the presence of a galaxy near the halo centre therefore will not dramatically change the screening property therein , though it can make a quantitative difference .",
    "although the screening properties on the scale of a galaxy is determined by the dark matter field , it is important to note that on the scale of stars , the screening is determined by the baryon field itself since dark matters can not be localized in such a small dense region .",
    "if the star is dense enough , the potential in the center region will be very deep .",
    "the star , at least , will be partially self - screened .",
    "it is very interesting to note that , in an unscreened halo , the stars can be treated as if living on the cosmological background .",
    "we take @xmath208 for instance . if a halo is unscreened , it means that its @xmath264 is smaller than @xmath265 , the halo has a mass of @xmath261 and its baryons contribute an additional potential of @xmath266 , which is still not enough to screen the halo .",
    "the contribution from the halo and galaxy to the potential of stars can be neglected , which , in turn , means that the screening of a star is determined by the depth of its own potential relative to the cosmological background field @xmath267 .",
    "comparing the properties of galaxies in screened versus unscreened haloes could potentially provide one of the most robust tests of @xmath0 gravity @xcite , because the formation and evolution of galaxies in these regions should differ significantly due to the @xmath268 enhancement of the gravitational force .",
    "however , caution must be taken when performing and interpreting these tests , due to the difficulty of correctly modelling the nonlinear environmental effects .",
    "detailed simulations and analysis of galaxy formation in @xmath0 gravity are needed before drawing quantitative conclusions .    when making applications to real galaxy surveys , the first step is to build a screening map @xcite .",
    "the unscreened samples are of particular interest . as is discussed above , massive components in the galaxy , such as stars , can self screen if they can generate deep enough local potential wells such that @xmath269 , where the threshold potential @xmath270 for models with different values of @xmath91 at @xmath271 are listed in table  [ values ] . here",
    "remember that @xmath136 has additional contributions from the galaxy , its host halo and their large - scale environment .",
    "the sun typically has the potential as @xmath272 and consequently main sequence stars similar to or more massive than the sun could be at least partially self - screened for @xmath0 models with @xmath273 . only low density components like the gaseous disk and low - mass stars , in unscreened haloes ,",
    "are unscreened .",
    "this picture of partially - screened galaxy opens a novel opportunity to test @xmath0 gravity by examining the different dynamics between their screened and unscreened components  @xcite .    however , as is pointed out in this work , to accurately identify unscreened galaxies in real surveys , we need to estimate the _ total _ newtonian potential @xmath274 at the positions of the galaxies , considering the latter to be tracers of the underlying dark matter field .",
    "a group catalogue could be used for this kind of study ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and it is crucial to understand how well the group luminosity of galaxy samples can trace the underling dark matter halo mass in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "when converting the group luminosity to the halo mass , further caution must be taken because there may be significant difference in the biases of screened and unscreened haloes .",
    "this work requires a careful investigation of halo and galaxy formation in @xmath0 gravity and therefore higher resolution simulations , which will be addressed in our future work .",
    "furthermore , the galaxy shear measurements may have the potential of determining the newtonian potential @xmath136 , namely the lensing potential , with significantly improved precisions .",
    "coming surveys such as euclid  @xcite will be able to reconstruct the three - dimensional lensing potential using weak lensing tomography @xcite . with these , the method presented in this paper offers a reliable way to select unscreened samples from galaxy surveys .",
    "combining galaxy shear measurements , galaxy surveys and additional observations on the galaxy properties may yield powerful tests on @xmath0 gravity in the future .",
    "finally , we would like to remark here that the efficiency of screening depends on the absolute depth of the potential well .",
    "this is due to the non - linear nature of the scalar field equation eq .",
    "( [ frpoisson ] ) .",
    "the reference of the depth of the potential well @xmath1 can not be chosen arbitrarily because @xmath1 should vanish for the homogenous density field , which actually defines the zero point of @xmath1 .",
