    "superfluid @xmath1he films adsorbed in porous media is an actual topic in physics of superfluidity@xcite .",
    "studying of this system gives a unique possibility to investigate the interplay between 2d and 3d physics , especially the character of the transition to the superfluid state .",
    "on one side , torsion - oscillator experiments reveal the dissipation peak near the temperature of the superfluid onset @xmath2 , which is predicted by the dynamical theory of vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite based on the kosterlitz - thouless theory for 2d films @xcite . on another side",
    ", they found that in films on porous substrates the superfluid density critical index @xmath3 @xcite of the 3d system and the sharp cusp of the specific heat @xcite at @xmath2 are similar to those near the @xmath4 transition of the bulk @xmath1he .",
    "an important insight into physics of superfluid films in porous media is provided by torsion - oscillator experiments with rotating substrates .",
    "the porous substrate is usually modeled with a jungle gym  structure @xcite : a 3d cubic lattice of intersecting cylinders of diameter @xmath5 with period @xmath6 ( fig.fig1 ) .",
    "multiple connectivity of superfluid films in porous media allows a variety of vortex configurations , and probably most important from them is a coreless , or pore 3d vortex , which is just a flow around the vortex pores having nonzero circulation .",
    "due to the presence of a new type of topological defects , one could expect an essential difference in the response between the plane film and the porous - medium film under rotation .",
    "this expectation was confirmed by torsional - oscillator experiments , which revealed a rotation - induced peak in dissipation ( inverse quality factor ) as a function of temperature .",
    "the additional peak was shifted from the stationary ( static ) peak that was observed without rotation fukuda_jltp_98,fukuda04 . double - peak structure essentially differs from the case of the plane film , where the only effect of rotation was to broaden the stationary peak @xcite .",
    "a semi - empirical interpretation of the rotation - induced dissipation peak was suggested in ref . .",
    "it is clear that the rotation can affect dissipation via rotation contribution to the velocity field .",
    "so it is a nonlinear correction to the response . instead of the derivation of such a correction from the theory , the authors of ref .",
    "used the data on the nonlinear response taken from the independent experiment on large - amplitude torsion - oscillations .",
    "this provided a qualitative explanation of the rotation peak , and even of some quantitative features of it , but could not pretend to be a full theory of the effect .",
    "the present work suggests really a theory of the rotation peak deriving the parameters of the peak from the parameters of the film and the substrate .",
    "the key role in our scenario is played by the 3d coreless vortices .",
    "we derived dynamics of these vortices from dynamics of 2d films adsorbed in porous media .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that motion of the coreless 3d vortices occurs in a creeping manner by jumping from cell to cell .",
    "these jumps are related to dissociation of the vortex - antivortex pair on one side of a rod separating different pores , with subsequent annihilation of the pair on another side of a rod .",
    "the result of the jump is a shift of velocity circulation to a neighboring pore .",
    "though our analysis was focused on application to the torsion - oscillator experiments , it is valid for description 3d vortex motion in many other cases , at least in those , where the vortex moves to distances much larger than the average period of the substrate structure .",
    "an important example is steady vortex motion in zero - frequency experiments .    in sec . [ 2 - 3d ]",
    "we describe how dynamics of 3d coreless vortices is connected with dynamics of 2d films covering the substrate .",
    "this provides a bridge between the effective - continuous - medium 3d description and dynamics of 2d films .",
    "section [ pd ] reviews the theory of dissociation of vortex - antivortex pairs on the basis of the kosterlitz - thouless theory . in sec .",
    "[ cp ] the pair - dissociation rate is analyzed near the critical temperature , where there is an analytical solution of kosterlitz s recursion equations . the theory is applied to the analysis of the torsion - oscillation experiments in sec .  [ to ] .",
    "the rotation - induced dissipation peak directly follows from the theory , and its position , shape and even height are in a good agreement with the experiment .",
    "section [ concl ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in a continuous medium a vortex is a topological defect with nonzero circulation around the vortex axis .",
    "there is an area around the vortex line with a suppressed order parameter , which is called vortex core .",
    "but topology of a porous medium allows circulation of superfluid velocity around a pore _ without suppression of the order parameter anywhere inside the superfluid film_. this leads to the concept of a coreless vortex .",
    "the vortex `` line '' in this case is not a line at all ; this is a chain of the jungle gym structure cells with nonzero circulation around them .",
    "schematically the coreless vortex is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "this coreless structure of a vortex rules out usual type of vortex motion in a continuous medium simply because the coreless vortex has no continuous coordinate : its position is discrete and is determined by a cell with nonzero circulation around it .",
    "the only way for the vortex to move is to jump from cell to cell .",
    "they call such a type of vortex motion _ vortex creep_. but any jump is in fact a process in time ( whatever short ) during which the vortex line inevitably cross a rod covered by a superfluid film .",
    "so during the jump the `` coreless '' vortex does have cores : at the place where it enters the rod and at the place where it comes out from the rod ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "these two cores together form a 2d vortex - antivortex pair , which should grow , dissociate , and eventually annihilate on the other side of the rod .",
    "this process lead to a discrete shift of the vortex line to a neighboring cell .",
    "for better illustration a two - dimensional picture of this process is shown in fig .",
    "it shows two cells : upper ( u ) and lower ( l ) . before the process ( fig .",
    "fig2a ) there is circulation @xmath7 around the lower cell as shown in the figure .",
    "provided that there is no other coreless vortices nearby , the same circulation exists around any path inclusive of the cell ( l ) as shown for the path around the both two cells .",
    "the transient process of the `` jump '' from the cell ( l ) to the cell ( u ) is shown in fig .",
    "the vortex - antivortex pair is present in the film between two pores .",
    "this makes circulation around any of the two cells undefined : it depends on whether the path goes outside or inside the pair .",
    "only circulation around the two cells together remains equal to @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig2]c shows the state after the process : the coreless vortex is now located in cell ( u ) . though this scenario is shown in the plane picture ,",
    "it is directly applicable to the 3d jungle gym structure with the 2d vortex and antivortex moving around a cylindric rod .     along the axis @xmath9 , and the vortex creeps along the axis @xmath10 .",
    "( a ) the state before the jump .",
    "there is circulation @xmath11 around the lower cell ( l ) as it is shown in picture .",
    "the same circulation exists around any path inclusive cell ( l ) .",
    "the circulation around two cells ( l ) and ( u ) is shown .",
    "the coreless vortex is located at the cell ( l ) .",
    "( b ) the vortex on the way between cells ( l ) and ( u ) . there is the vortex - antivortex pair ( vap ) in the film .",
    "circulations around the paths inclusive only of cell ( l ) or ( u ) are not defined , while for the path around the two cells circulation is equal to @xmath11 as before .",
    "( c ) the state after the jump .",
    "the coreless vortex is located at the cell ( u ) .",
    "no circulation around the cell ( l ) anymore , but there is circulation around the cell ( u ) , or around the two of them.,width=566 ]    in reality creation and dissociation of vortex - antivortex pairs is a stochastic process , which is determined by the average dissociation rate @xmath12 ( number of dissociation events per second and per unit area of a film ) , which depends on temperature @xmath13 and , most important for us , on average superfluid velocity @xmath14 in the film . in our case",
    "the superfluid velocity field consists of two parts : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 originates from a circular flow around the vortex line at rest and @xmath17 is a transport superfluid velocity with respect to a moving substrate . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the velocity @xmath18 is directed along the axis @xmath9 .",
    "so it it is added to the circular velocity @xmath16 above the cell with circulation @xmath19 and is subtracted from @xmath16 below this cell",
    ". therefore the jumps of the vortex line up and down are unbalanced and result in some average drift ( creep ) of the vortex line up the picture in fig .",
    "this jump - like process can , nevertheless , be described with an average vortex velocity determined as @xmath20where @xmath6 is the period of the jungle gym structure , and @xmath21 is the area of the rod separating neighboring pores . according to this scenario of vortex motion the vortex velocity @xmath22 is strictly normal to the velocity @xmath17 .",
    "let us compare the relation ( [ vly ] ) with the general relation connecting the vortex velocity of the vortex line with the normal and the superfluid velocities @xcite : @xmath23 in the problem under consideration we can assume that the normal component is clamped to the porous - glass substrate oscillating with the velocity @xmath24 .",
    "so their velocities coincide : @xmath25 .",
    "in fact equation ( [ vly ] ) is written for the system moving with the substrate , where @xmath26 .",
    "eventually eqs .",
    "( vly ) and ( [ vl_standard ] ) agree if @xmath27note that the condition @xmath28 providing that vortices move normally to the superfluid motion means the absence of the effective  magnus force @xcite , which is defined as the term @xmath29 $ ] is the balance of forces on the vortex . in superconductors",
    "this leads to the total absence of the hall effect .",
    "absence of the effective magnus force is typical for lattice systems @xcite , in contrast to uniform continuous media with galilean invariance .",
    "the crossover between these two cases was recently studied by numerically solving the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite .",
    "so we have demonstrated that the creep of coreless vortices , which is realized via sequences of discrete jumps from cell to cell , can be described in the terms usually used for 3d vortices moving in a continuous medium .",
    "still the parameters of this 3d effective - medium  description must be determined within the theory of 2d films covering the multi - connected substrate .",
    "the crucial parameter to be determined is the derivative @xmath30 of the dissociation rate @xmath31 .",
