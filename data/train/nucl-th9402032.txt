    "this challenge arises , in part , because boundary conditions are more naturally imposed in coordinate space , and , in part , because non - normalizable states can not be fourier transformed@xcite . in spite of the difficulties , momentum - space calculations are important because fewer approximations are needed there to handle the nonlocal potentials arising in many - body and field theories .",

    "we now effectively deduce the intermediate @xmath50 phase shift from the diagonal elements , do the vp matching with the corresponding @xmath53 s as in ( [ spinless ] ) ( this effectively determines the final phase shift @xmath54 ) , and then we use the original u matrix to transform back to the basis in which we calculate observables : @xmath55= [ u]^{-1}[s'][u ] \\ .\\ ] ] even though the method is guaranteed to diagonalize the s matrix , as an internal test we check that @xmath56 and that @xmath57 .",
    "we have modified the lpotp code@xcite to include the coulomb potential in the different spin channels . as a first test of our precision we solved the lippmann - schwinger equation with a point coulomb potential and checked that our answers reproduced the point coulomb phase shifts @xmath58 [ after removal of the @xmath59 term in ( [ coulwf ] ) ] .",
    "we concluded from this severe test that 4864 grid points are required to solve the lippmann - schwinger equation and obtain four  five place precision in @xmath58 [ there is enough cancellation that three  place precision does not reproduce the point coulomb scattering amplitude @xmath60 ( [ fpt ] ) ] .",
    "after an overall @xmath61 is factored out from the sum in ( [ fpt ] ) , good agreement for @xmath60 was found ( indistinguishable from the analytic amplitude on a five - decade semi - logarithmic plot ) .    as the next test we computed pure - coulomb scattering of @xmath62 mev protons from the charge distribution of @xmath2he .",
    "we were able to obtain essentially perfect reproduction of the born - approximation amplitude , @xmath63 which proves that we can include short - ranged effects  in addition to the long - range coulomb force  with precision of at least @xmath64 . to actually obtain this agreement we used 48 grid points in the solution of the lippmann ",
    "schwinger equation ( [ ls2 ] ) , and increased the precision of our partial - wave projection : @xmath65 until the partial wave summation , @xmath66 reproduced all oscillations present in @xmath67 .",

    "ten - place reproduction demanded @xmath70 .",
    "we expect these number to scale as @xmath71 , and so larger nuclei or higher energies will require more partial waves and grid points . for these calculations we used analytic nuclear form factors@xcite , though we also were successful for @xmath3c using numerical fourier transforms of wood - saxon densities@xcite .",
    "however , noise and instability do appear for form factors which fall off slowly in @xmath7 .",
    "an important requirement on the vp method is that the matching radius , which we take equal to @xmath9 , be larger than the range of the nuclear force ( in order to be able to express the outer wavefunction as a linear combination of coulomb waves ) .",
    "however , increasing @xmath9 makes the cut - off coulomb potential more oscillatory and more difficult to reproduce .",
    "in fact , it was the sensitivity to changes in @xmath9 which led ref.@xcite to search for an alternative to the matching method .",
    "we find that using @xmath72 fm produces unstable results ( presumably cutting off the nuclear potential ) , but , as seen in figure  [ fig.sig ] , we obtain stable results for @xmath73 .    in figure  [ fig.sig+a ]",
    "we compare the nuclear  plus coulomb cross section and polarization ( solid curves ) to those calculated without coulomb ( dashed curves ) .",
    "the exact handling of the coulomb potential is seen to have a significant , although small , effect in the semilog plot of @xmath74 , and a more pronounced effect for @xmath75 .",

    "we also generalized the blatt - biedenharn phase shift analysis for the scattering of two spin @xmath13 particles to cases where the s matrix is no longer symmetric .",
    "although our formulation and calculational procedure is for a more complicated spin case , we confirm the finding of arrellano et al.@xcite that the vp procedure can be made sufficiently accurate for intermediate - energy proton scattering if high - precision partial - wave expansions and large numbers of partial waves are used .",
