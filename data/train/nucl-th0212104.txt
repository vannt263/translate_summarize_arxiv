    "the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite with the self - consistent mean - field derived with making use of the gogny s interaction@xcite or the skyrme - type interactions@xcite is nowadays one of the standard tool to perform nuclear structure calculations .",
    "many properties of the nuclear collective states can be described successfully within such models @xcite .",
    "due to the anharmonicity of vibrations there is a coupling between one - phonon and more complex states @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is that the complexity of calculations beyond the standard rpa increases rapidly with the size of the configuration space and one has to work within limited spaces .",
    "it is well known that using simple separable forces one can perform calculations of nuclear characteristics in very large configuration spaces since there is no need to diagonalize matrices whose dimensions grow with the size of configuration space . for example , the well - known quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite belongs to such a model .",
    "very detailed predictions can be made by qpm for nuclei away from closed shells@xcite .",
    "that is why a finite rank approximation for the particle  hole ( p - h ) interaction resulting from skyrme - type forces has been suggested in our previous work @xcite .",
    "thus , the self - consistent mean field can be calculated in the standard way with the original skyrme interaction whereas the rpa solutions would be obtained with the finite rank approximation to the p - h  matrix elements .",
    "it was found that the finite rank approximation reproduces reasonably well the dipole and quadrupole strength distributions in ar isotopes @xcite .",
    "recently , we extended the finite rank approximation for p - h interactions of skyrme type to take into account pairing @xcite .",
    "we tested our approach to calculate characteristics of the low - lying quadrupole and octupole states in some spherical nuclei . in this paper",
    "we apply our approach to study the low lying quadrupole and octupole states in some s isotopes . choosing as examples some spherical nuclei we demonstrate an ability of the method to describe correctly the strength distributions in a broad excitation energy interval .",
    "we start from the effective skyrme interaction@xcite and use the notation of ref.@xcite containing explicit density dependence and all spin - exchange terms .",
    "the single - particle spectrum is calculated within the hf method .",
    "the continuous part of the single - particle spectrum is discretized by diagonalizing the hf hamiltonian on the harmonic oscillator basis@xcite .",
    "the p - h residual interaction @xmath0 corresponding to the skyrme force and including both direct and exchange terms can be obtained as the second derivative of the energy density functional with respect to the density@xcite .",
    "following our previous papers@xcite we simplify @xmath0 by approximating it by its landau - migdal form . for skyrme interactions all landau parameters @xmath1 with @xmath2",
    "are zero . here , we keep only the @xmath3 terms in @xmath4 and in the coordinate representation one can write it in the following form : @xmath5 \\delta ( { \\bf r}_1-{\\bf r } _ 2 )   \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the spin and isospin operators , and @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 standing for the fermi momentum and nucleon effective mass .",
    "the expressions for @xmath11 in terms of the skyrme force parameters can be found in ref.@xcite . because of the density dependence of the interaction the landau parameters of eq.([eq2 ] ) are functions of the coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "the p - h residual interaction can be presented as a sum of @xmath13 separable terms . to illustrate a procedure for making the finite rank approximation we examine only the contribution of the term @xmath14 . in what follows we use the second quantized representation and @xmath4",
    "can be written as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the particle creation ( annihilation ) operator and @xmath18 denotes the quantum numbers @xmath19 ,    @xmath20    @xmath21    in the above equation , @xmath22 is the reduced matrix element of the spherical harmonics @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the radial integral : @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the radial part of the hf single - particle wavefunction .",
    "as it is shown in @xcite the radial integrals can be calculated accurately by choosing a large enough cutoff radius @xmath28 and using a @xmath13-point integration gauss formula with abscissas @xmath29 and weights @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31    so we employ the hamiltonian including an average nuclear hf field , pairing interactions , the isoscalar and isovector particle  hole residual forces in the finite rank separable form @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian has the same form as the qpm hamiltonian with @xmath13 separable terms @xcite , but in contrast to the qpm all parameters of this hamiltonian are expressed through parameters of the skyrme forces .    in what follows we work in the quasiparticle representation defined by the canonical bogoliubov transformation : @xmath32 the single - particle states are specified by the quantum numbers @xmath33 the quasiparticle energies ,",
    "the chemical potentials , the energy gap and the coefficients @xmath34,@xmath35 of the bogoliubov transformations ( [ b ] ) are determined from the bcs equations .",
    "we introduce the phonon creation operators @xmath36    where @xmath37    the index @xmath38 denotes total angular momentum and @xmath39 is its z - projection in the laboratory system .",
    "one assumes that the qrpa ground state is the phonon vacuum @xmath40 , + i.e. @xmath41 .",
    "we define the excited states for this approximation by @xmath42 .",
    "making use of the linearized equation - of - motion approach @xcite one can derive the qrpa equations @xcite :    @xmath43    in qrpa problems there appear two types of interaction matrix elements , the matrix related to forward - going graphs @xmath44 and the matrix related to backward - going graphs @xmath45",
    ". solutions of this set of linear equations yield the eigen - energies and the amplitudes @xmath46 of the excited states .",
    "a dimension of the matrixes @xmath47 is a space size of the two - quasiparticle configurations .",
    "expressions for @xmath47 and @xmath46 are given in @xcite .",
    "using the finite rank approximation we need to invert a matrix having a dimension @xmath48 independently of the configuration space size .",
    "one can find a prescription how to solve the system ( [ eq14 ] ) within our approach in @xcite .",
    "the qrpa equations in the qpm @xcite have the same form as the equations derived within our approach@xcite , but the single - particle spectrum and parameters of the p - h residual interaction are calculated making use of the skyrme forces .    in this work we use the standard parametrization siii @xcite of the skyrme force .",
    "spherical symmetry is assumed for the hf ground states . it is well known @xcite that the constant gap approximation leads to an overestimating of occupation probabilities for subshells that are far from the fermi level and it is necessary to introduce a cut - off in the single - particle space . above this",
    "cut - off subshells do nt participate in the pairing effect . in our calculations",
    "we choose the bcs subspace to include all subshells lying below 5 mev .",
    "the pairing constants are fixed to reproduce the odd - even mass difference of neighboring nuclei . in order to perform rpa calculations ,",
    "the single - particle continuum is discretized @xcite by diagonalizing the hf hamiltonian on a basis of twelve harmonic oscillator shells and cutting off the single - particle spectra at the energy of 160 mev .",
    "this is sufficient to exhaust practically all the energy - weighted sum rule .",
    "our investigations @xcite enable us to conclude that @xmath13=45 is enough for multipolarities @xmath49 in nuclei with @xmath50 .",
    "increasing @xmath13 , for example , up to @xmath13=60 in @xmath51pb changes results for energies and transition probabilities not more than by 1% , so all calculations in what follows have been done with @xmath13=45 .",
    "our calculations show that , for the normal parity states one can neglect the spin - multipole interactions as a rule and this reduces by a factor 2 the total matrix dimension .",
    "for example , for the octupole excitations in @xmath52pb @xcite we need to invert a matrix having a dimension 2n=90 instead of diagonalizing a @xmath53 matrix as it would be without the finite rank approximation . for light nuclei",
    "the reduction of matrix dimensions due to the finite rank approximation is 3 or 4 .",
    "so , for heavy nuclei our approach gives a large gain in comparison with an exact diagonalization .",
    "it is worth to point out that after solving the rpa problem with a separable interaction , to take into account the coupling with two - phonon configurations demands to diagonalize a matrix having a size that does not exceed 40 for the giant resonance calculations in heavy nuclei whereas one would need to diagonalize a matrix with a dimension of the order of a few thousands at least for a non - separable case .",
    "as a first example we examine the @xmath54 and @xmath55 state energies and transition probabilities in some s isotopes .",
    "the results of our calculations for the energies and b(e2)-values and the experimental data @xcite are shown in table 1 .",
    "one can see that there is a rather good agreement with experimental data .",
    "results of our calculations for s isotopes are close to those of qrpa with skyrme forces @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the b(e2)-values in the s isotopes demonstrates clearly the pairing effects .",
    "the experimental and calculated b(e2)-values in @xmath56s are two times less than those in @xmath57s .",
    "the neutron shell closure leads to the vanishing of the neutron pairing and a reduction of the proton gap . as a result",
    "there is a remarkable reduction of the e2 transition probability in @xmath56s .",
    "some overestimate of the energies in @xmath57s indicates that there is room for two - phonon effects .",
    "the study of the influence of two - phonon configurations on properties of the low - lying states within our approach is in progress now .",
    "results of our calculations for the @xmath55 energies and the transition probabilities b(e3 ) are compared with experimental data @xcite in table 2 .",
    "generally there is a good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "an additional information about the structure of the first @xmath58 states can be extracted by looking at the ratio of the multipole transition matrix elements @xmath59 that depend on the relative contributions of the proton and neutron configurations . in the framework of the collective model for isoscalar excitations",
    "this ratio is equal to @xmath60 and any deviation from this value can indicate an isovector character of the state .",
    "the @xmath59 ratio can be determined experimentally by using different external probes @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , qrpa calculations of the @xmath59 ratios for the @xmath54 states in some s isotopes have been done .",
    "the predicted results are in good agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "our calculated values of the @xmath59 ratios for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 states are shown in tables 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "our results support the conclusions of refs .",
    "@xcite about the isovector character of the @xmath54 states in @xmath56s",
    ". as one can see from table 2 our calculations predict that the @xmath59 ratios for the @xmath55 states are rather close to @xmath61 , thus indicating their isoscalar character .    to test our approach for high lying states we examine the dipole strength distributions .",
    "the calculated dipole strength distributions ( gdr ) in @xmath56ar , @xmath62sn and @xmath51pb are displayed in fig .",
    "1 . for the energy centroids",
    "@xmath63 we get 19.9 mev , 15.8 mev and 12.7 mev in @xmath56ar , @xmath62sn and @xmath51pb respectively .",
    "the calculated energy centroid for @xmath51pb is in a satisfactory agreement with the experimental value @xcite ( 13.4 mev ) .",
    "the values of energy centroids for @xmath56ar and @xmath62sn are rather close to the empirical systematics @xcite @xmath64 mev . for @xmath56ar",
    "the qrpa gives results that are very similar to our previous calculations with the particle - hole rpa @xcite because the influence of pairing on the giant resonance properties is weak .",
    "it is worth to mention that experimental data for the giant resonances in light nuclei are very scarce .",
    "the octupole strength distribution in @xmath51pb is rather well studied in many experiments @xcite .",
    "the calculated octupole strength distribution up to the excitation energy 35 mev is shown in fig .",
    "according to experimental data @xcite for the @xmath55 state in @xmath51pb the excitation energy equals to @xmath65 mev and the energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) is exhausted by 20.4% that can be compared with the calculated values @xmath66 mev and ewsr=21% . for the low - energy octupole resonance below 7.5 mev",
    "our calculation gives the centroid energy @xmath67mev and ewsr=12% and experimental values are 5.4 mev and 15.2% accordingly .",
    "for the high - energy octupole resonance we get values @xmath68 mev and ewsr=61% that are in a good agreement with experimental findings @xmath69 mev and ewsr=@xmath70% @xcite",
    ". one can conclude that present calculations reproduce correctly not only the @xmath55 characteristics , but the whole octupole strength distribution in @xmath51pb .",
    "a finite rank separable approximation for the qrpa calculations with skyrme interactions that was proposed in our previous work is applied to study the evolution of dipole , quadrupole and octupole excitations in several nuclei .",
    "it is shown that the suggested approach enables one to reduce remarkably the dimensions of the matrices that must be inverted to perform structure calculations in very large configuration spaces .    as an illustration of the method we have calculated the energies and transition probabilities of the @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 states in some s , ar , sn and pb isotopes .",
    "the calculated values are very close to those that were calculated in qrpa with the full skyrme interactions .",
    "they are in an agreement with available experimental data .",
