    "it is widely believed that cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large scale structure of the universe we observe today originate from fluctuations generated during the time of inflation .",
    "it is often assumed that the quantum fluctuation of the inflaton is responsible for that . during inflation ,",
    "the inflaton slowly rolls down its potential , which gives almost scale - invariant primordial fluctuations and some gravity waves can also be generated .",
    "usually the primordial fluctuations are characterized by the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "once the potential for the inflaton is given , one can predict these quantities to compare with cosmological observations .",
    "current cosmological data are very precise to severely constrain models of inflation and some models are considered to have been already excluded @xcite .",
    "in fact , the considerations of the spectral index and tensor modes may not be enough to probe primordial fluctuations .",
    "the non - gaussianity of the fluctuations can also be measured by cosmological observations and be used to test the scenario generating primordial fluctuations . in particular , there has recently been reported that non - gaussianity is detected in the cosmic microwave background almost at 3@xmath3 level @xcite .",
    "since simple single - field inflation models predict very small non - gaussianity , if the evidence for large non - gaussianity is mounting in the future , these models which at present are judged to be successful as regards the amplitude and scale dependence for primordial curvature fluctuations may suffer from a great difficulty .",
    "however , notice that another source of fluctuations other than the inflaton can contribute to the cosmic density fluctuations . among such possibilities , the curvaton mechanism @xcite and modulated reheating scenarios @xcite , for example , have been proposed and some of their observational consequences including issues of the non - gaussianity have also been investigated . in particular",
    ", it is discussed that large non - gaussianity can be produced in these scenarios .",
    "it should be reminded that cosmic density fluctuations can originate from one of these mechanisms including the inflaton or from some combination of these .",
    "thus , even though almost perfect gaussian fluctuations are generated in simple inflation models where they originate only from the inflaton , large non - gaussianity can be produced for total by adding the contribution from another generation mechanism .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to study the issue of non - gaussianity in models of this kind , paying particular attention to a mixed scenario where fluctuations of the inflaton and the curvaton can both contribute to primordial fluctuations . in investigating the non - gaussianity ,",
    "we focus not only on the bispectrum but also on the trispectrum which is a potentially useful observable in the near future .",
    "it should also be noticed that the predictions of the amplitude , the spectral index and tensor modes can be affected when another source of fluctuations is introduced in the model .",
    "interestingly , some models of inflation which are disfavored by the data can be liberated by assuming the curvaton mechanism to work because of such modifications @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been studied in what cases models of inflation can be relaxed by adding fluctuations from the curvaton in some detail assuming some concrete inflation models focusing on the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio . in any case , since we can expect much more precise measurements of these quantities in the future experiment such as planck , we should also investigate the predictions for the scale dependence of primordial curvature fluctuations and tensor modes in the mixed scenario as well as that for non - gaussianity .",
    "another aim of this paper is to analyze this issue extending the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to include the case where the curvaton is always subdominant component in the history of the universe , which was not considered in ref .",
    ". then we study the effects of the curvaton on inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio and compare with recent observations of wmap .",
    "furthermore , we also discuss in what cases / models large non - gaussianity can be generated satisfying the constraints on the scale dependence and tensor modes of primordial fluctuations in the scenario .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the formalism to study observational quantities in models with mixed fluctuations from the inflaton and the curvaton .",
    "we derive the expressions for the scalar spectral index , its running , the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the non - linearity parameters for such mixed models .",
    "then , in section [ sec : obs ] , we investigate those inflationary parameters assuming several concrete inflation models .",
    "first of all , we study the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio for each model and then discuss whether they are compatible with current observations . for inflation models which are considered to have been already excluded by the data , we discuss in what case",
    "the curvaton can liberate the model .",
    "specifically , we discuss in what cases non - gaussianity can be large .",
    "the final section is devoted to conclusion and summary of this paper .",
    "in the following , we adopt the @xmath4 formalism @xcite to calculate the primordial power spectrum and some non - linearity parameters . thus we briefly review the @xmath4 formalism here .    in the @xmath4 formalism , the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath5 on the uniform energy density hypersurface at the time @xmath6 is equal to the perturbation in the local expansion defined with respect to an initial spatially flat hypersurface .",
    "on sufficiently large scales where the spatial gradient can be neglected , the local expansion is well approximated by the expansion of the unperturbed universe , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the local hubble expansion and @xmath9 is some time during inflation .",
    "then the primordial curvature perturbation can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the expansion in the background spacetime : @xmath12 if we take @xmath9 as a time when the cosmological scale crossed the horizon scale during inflation , then @xmath13 becomes a function of the scalar field at the time of horizon crossing .",
    "hence @xmath5 can be written as , @xmath14 where the summation is implied over repeated indices which label the scalar field .",
    "here @xmath15 is the perturbation of the scalar field @xmath16 on the flat slicing at the time of horizon crossing . in the following ,",
    "when the asterisk @xmath17 is shown in the subscript , it indicates that the quantities are evaluated at the time of horizon crossing .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 for the purpose of this paper , we include the terms up to cubic order in the perturbations of the scalar field .",
    "if we choose @xmath22 well after the reheating , then @xmath23 gives the primordial adiabatic perturbations .",
    "now we write down the expression for the primordial power spectrum which is defined as @xmath24 by using eq .  , we can express @xmath25 with the fluctuations of scalar fields as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the power spectrum of scalar fields : @xmath28 in this paper , we consider two scalar fields , the inflaton and the curvaton which are denoted as @xmath29 and @xmath3 and their fluctuations are indicated as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "thus the indices for scalar fields are understood to represent either of these fields in the following .",
    "the fluctuations at the time of horizon crossing @xmath32 and @xmath33 are assumed to be uncorrelated random fields with the same amplitude .",
    "hence we have @xmath34 then at leading order in fluctuations of the scalar fields , the power spectrum can be written as @xmath35 the expression for @xmath18 will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "now we discuss quantities which represent non - gaussianity , the bispectrum and trispectrum .",
    "the definition of the bispectrum @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 as is the case with the power spectrum , the leading order bispectrum can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the bispectrum of the scalar fields @xmath40    the trispectrum @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 and can be given with the power spectrum @xmath43 , the bispectrum @xmath39 and the trispectrum @xmath44 for the scalar fields , @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath44 is given by @xmath47 expressions for @xmath48 and @xmath49 were provided in @xcite and @xcite for general multiple - fields slow - roll inflation ( see also @xcite ) . in the following , we will neglect @xmath48 and @xmath49 because the inclusion of these terms only gives corrections of slow - roll order to the primordial bispectrum and trispectrum , which are far below the observational sensitivity expected for the planck satellite .",
    "then @xmath36 and @xmath41 can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constant parameters which are given in terms of the derivatives of the number of @xmath53-folding with respect to the scalar fields as @xcite , @xmath54 these expressions are valid for the case where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are negligibly small .",
    "furthermore , an interesting inequality can be obtained with the help of the cauchy - schwartz inequality @xcite : @xmath55 this inequality holds for the scenarios such as the curvaton and the modulated reheating scenarios where the leading non - gaussianity comes from super - horizon evolution .    to calculate the primordial power spectrum and the non - linearity parameters , we need to know the number of @xmath53-folding as a function of the field value of the scalar fields , the inflaton and the curvaton , from the time when the cosmological scales crossed the horizon to the time when the universe becomes radiation - dominated connected to big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . in the next subsection",
    ", we discuss this issue in detail .      here",
    "we give an explicit expression for the number of @xmath53-folding in models with the inflaton and the curvaton .",
    "for the potential of the curvaton , we take a quadratic potential , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the curvaton mass .",
    "we assume that the energy density of the curvaton is subdominant during inflation and at least until the time when the inflaton decays into radiation .",
    "in addition , the the curvaton mass is assumed as @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the hubble parameter during inflation . in this case",
    ", the curvaton field almost stays at the initial value during inflation .",
    "after inflation ends , the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of its potential for some time , then decays into radiation .",
    "the curvaton also begins to oscillate    at around a time when @xmath60 and decays into radiation . in the following , we assume that the curvaton decays long after the onset of the curvaton oscillations , which is equivalent to assume that @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the decay rate of the curvaton .    here",
    "we give a rough sketch of the thermal history of the universe in this scenario .",
    "in fact , depending on the initial amplitude of the curvaton field , the thermal history after the inflaton decay can become different .",
    "when the initial value of the curvaton @xmath63 is small enough , typically as @xmath64 , the curvaton begins to oscillate around the minimum of the potential during radiation - dominated epoch due to the inflaton decay . with the potential eq .  , the energy density of the curvaton decreases as @xmath65 when @xmath3 oscillates . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy density of radiation decreases as @xmath66 , thus the curvaton can become dominant if the curvaton oscillates around the potential minimum long enough before decaying into radiation",
    ". if the decay rate of the curvaton is not so small , it can decay before it becomes a dominant component . in any case ,",
    "when the rate of the hubble expansion @xmath8 becomes comparable to the decay rate of the curvaton , the curvaton decays into radiation .",
    "after the curvaton decays into radiation , the universe is radiation - dominated and is led to bbn epoch .",
    "when the initial value for the curvaton field is large enough , typically as @xmath67 , the curvaton almost stays at the initial value and drives the second inflation even after the onset of the radiation - dominated epoch due to the inflaton decay .",
    "the thermal history in this case is as follows : after the inflation driven by the inflaton ends , the inflaton decays into radiation , then the universe becomes radiation dominated",
    ". when the initial amplitude of the curvaton is large , @xmath3 stays at the initial value until long after the inflaton decays into radiation . since the energy density of such a scalar field is constant , at some epoch , the energy density of the curvaton dominates to give the second inflationary epoch",
    "this situation is similar to that of a double inflation model @xcite .",
    "after the curvaton drives the second inflation , it begins to oscillate around the minimum of the potential when the hubble parameter decreases as @xmath68 .",
    "then the curvaton decays into radiation when @xmath69 .",
    "since we would like to calculate the primordial power spectrum and some non - linearity parameters during the radiation - dominated epoch after the curvaton decay , we need to know the @xmath53-folding number from the time when the cosmological scale exits the horizon during inflation to the time after the decay of the curvaton .",
    "we denote the number of @xmath53-folding during these epochs as @xmath70 . for later convenience",
    ", we divide @xmath70 into several parts as @xmath71 where @xmath72 represents the number of @xmath53-folding during inflation driven by the inflaton .",
    "@xmath73 is for the epoch from the end of inflation to some time after the decay of the inflaton .",
    "@xmath74 refers to the @xmath53-folding number from that time to the time well after the curvaton decay .",
    "@xmath74 is relevant to the curvaton dynamics .",
    "now we make detailed discussion on @xmath75 and @xmath74 in order to calculate the primordial power spectrum and the non - linearity parameters in the @xmath4 formalism .",
    "we do not discuss @xmath73 here since it is irrelevant to the primordial fluctuation depends on @xmath76 so that it is also relevant to the primordial fluctuations .",
    "however , as stated in the paragraph below eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_sigma ] ) , we do not consider such a case in this paper . ] .",
    "however , when we relate the cosmological scales observed today to the time of horizon exit during inflation , we also need @xmath77 , which we will discuss in the subsection  [ sec : scale ] .",
    "first we start with @xmath72 , the number of @xmath53-folding during inflation .",
    "it is determined by the dynamics of the inflaton whose equation of motion is @xmath78 where a dot represents the derivative with respect to the cosmic time and @xmath79 . during the inflation ,",
    "the so - called slow - roll ( sr ) approximation is valid .",
    "hence @xmath72 can be written as , by using @xmath80 , @xmath81 where @xmath9 and @xmath82 respectively represent the times when a scale exits the horizon and when the inflation ends .",
    "similarly , @xmath83 and @xmath84 indicate the scalar field values at corresponding epochs . to give a more concrete expression for @xmath72 , we need to specify the potential for the inflaton .",
    "next we consider @xmath74 .",
    "after the inflaton decays into the radiation , the universe is composed of radiation and the curvaton . hence the background equations are given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are energy densities of radiation and the curvaton , respectively .",
    "to obtain @xmath74 , we solve the above equations from the time @xmath88 which corresponds to some time after the reheating epoch due to the decay of the inflaton with the initial conditions @xmath89 to the time @xmath22 when the hubble parameter becomes much smaller than @xmath62 , i.e.,@xmath90 .",
    "here we denote the initial amplitude for the curvaton field with an asterisk as @xmath76 .",
    "remind that we are using an asterisk to represent that a quantity is evaluated at the time of horizon exit .",
    "since @xmath3 almost stays at the initial position during inflation , the initial value for @xmath3 here is the same as that at the horizon exit during inflation . by integrating eq .",
    ", we can write @xmath74 formally as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined as @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in general , we need a numerical calculation to evaluate @xmath95",
    ". however , for some cases , we can integrate analytically the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_q ] ) , which will be explicitly given in the next subsection .",
    "it should be noted here that , when the curvaton does not drive the secondary inflation and begins to oscillate during the radiation - dominated epoch caused by the inflaton decay , the value of @xmath96 depends only on the combination @xmath97 when the curvaton is oscillating , it can be regarded as a matter fluid as long as the background evolution is concerned .",
    "then the universe can be regarded as a two component system which consists of matter and radiation . in this case",
    ", it has been shown that the solution for the system of eqs .  , and depends only on the single parameter @xmath98 defined above @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath96 can be determined once @xmath98 is fixed for such a case .",
    "when the second inflation driven by the curvaton occurs , the curvaton can not be regarded as matter . however , even in this case , the value of @xmath96 can be determined once @xmath76 and the combination @xmath99 are given . during the second inflationary phase , the slow - roll approximation is valid for the curvaton field as in the case during inflation . in this case , @xmath74 can be written as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the value of @xmath3 at the end of the second inflation .",
    "@xmath102 represents the @xmath53-folding number from the end of the second inflation to the time well after the curvaton decay and does not depend on @xmath103 .",
    "thus , even in this case , once the combination @xmath104 is given along with @xmath76 , the number of @xmath53-folding @xmath74 is determined .",

    "we showed that some inflation models already excluded by the current data such as chaotic inflation with higher polynomials @xmath271 and @xmath262 can be liberated depending on the parameters which characterize the curvaton . by presenting contours of @xmath132 and @xmath121 in the @xmath133@xmath76 plane ,",
    "we have explicitly shown in what cases such models can be relaxed to be allowed by the data .",
    "we have also presented contours of the non - linearity parameters in the @xmath133@xmath76 plane . in particular",
    ", it should be noticed that , the non - gaussianity can be large due to the contribution from the curvaton without conflicting with the data .    on the other hand , some inflation models such as the new inflation where the slow - roll parameter @xmath194 is very small are scarcely affected by the curvaton .",
    "the effects of the curvaton on @xmath132 and @xmath121 appear as in the combination of @xmath322 , thus the size of @xmath194 is crucial when one considers how the curvaton affects the inflationary predictions .",
    "furthermore , non - gaussianity can not be large in this model even if we introduce the curvaton because the @xmath194 parameter is very small in this model .",
    "as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f_nl])@xmath347([eq : g_nl ] ) , the curvaton contribution to the non - linearity parameters is always associated with @xmath194 .",
    "thus inflation models with very small @xmath194 can not generate large non - gaussianity even with the curvaton .",
    "although we have concentrated on adiabatic fluctuations thus far , isocurvature fluctuations can be produced in principle , depending on the thermal history of the universe .",
    "it can happen when dark matter or baryon was generated ( and its number is conserved ) before the decay of the curvaton or from the decay products of the curvaton @xcite . in the case where dark matter and baryon were produced after the decay of the curvaton ,",
    "no isocurvature perturbation is generated even in our mixed model .",
    "in this paper , we have considered this kind of case to avoid complexities coming from the contamination of isocurvature modes when we interpret observational signatures .",
    "however , here we comment on the cases where some isocurvature fluctuations are generated .",
    "first of all , since pure cold dark matter ( cdm)/bayron isocurvature modes ( regardless of its correlation with adiabatic mode ) are severely constrained by observations , the pure curvaton scenario with isocurvature fluctuations such as the above mentioned cases are disfavored from current observations .",
    "however , it should be noted here that the constraint can be relaxed when adiabatic fluctuations from the inflaton contribute to the total density fluctuations , which is the case for the mixed scenario .",
    "this is simply because the contribution from adiabatic mode decreases the fraction of the isocurvature contribution to the total fluctuations .",
    "thus the mixed scenario may have interesting implications on scenarios with isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "for example , even in the case where dark matter was generated before the decay of the curvaton , the mixed scenario is still allowed if adiabatic fluctuations from the inflaton is bigger than that from the curvaton to some extent . similarly , although a scenario where dark matter was generated from the decay products of the curvaton is severely constrained by the argument of isocurvature fluctuations , as in the case discussed above , the constraint is significantly relaxed in the mixed scenario if adiabatic fluctuation from the inflaton is much bigger than that from the curvaton .",
    "it should be noticed that large non - gaussianity would not be produced when the contribution from the inflaton is large compared to that from the curvaton . on the other hand ,",
    "when the contribution from the curvaton with isocurvature mode is large , such a scenario is severely constrained by the consideration of isocurvature mode , which corresponds to the case where the fraction of energy density of the curvaton to the total one becomes comparable to that of the inflaton .",
    "remind that large non - gaussianity can be generated when the fraction of energy density of the curvaton to the total one is very small .",
    "thus non - gaussianity would not be so large in this case too .",
    "since a simple single - field inflation model can only generate very small non - gaussianity , if the evidence of non - gaussianity , which was recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , is established in the future , this mechanism of generating large non - gaussianity will be very interesting .",
    "although we concentrate on the mixed model of the inflaton and the curvaton in this paper , other mixed model may also be worth investigating .",
    "in particular , large non - gaussianity can also be generated in the modulated reheating @xcite and preheating scenarios @xcite so that the implications of such a mixed model on the inflationary parameters and non - gaussianity are of great interest and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
