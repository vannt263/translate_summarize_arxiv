    "the field of two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) has witnessed rapid expansion in the last several years , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically.@xcite along with fundamental interest in the properties of such systems , and as a test ground for highly correlated electrons , a major motivation for these growing endeavors has been the promising outlook and potential of quantum dots concerning the implementation of solid - state quantum computing and quantum information devices .",
    "@xcite to this effect highly precise control of the space and spin degrees of freedom of a small number @xmath3 of confined electrons ( down to an empty @xcite qd ) needs to be achieved , and experimentally this was demonstrated recently for two electrons in a lateral double quantum dot molecule ( see ref .  , and references therein ) .",
    "from the theoretical standpoint , high - level computational methods that reach beyond the level of mean - field approximation are needed , @xcite with the ability to provide solutions that preserve all the symmetries of the many - body hamiltonian , and in particular those associated with the total spin . in this context ,",
    "electrons in quantum dots exhibit localization in space and formation of wigner molecules ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "when the spin degree of freedom is considered , such wigner molecules may be viewed as finite heisenberg spin clusters @xcite whose quantum behavior ( due to finite - size fluctuations and correlation effects ) differs drastically from the behavior expected from magnetic systems in the thermodynamic limit.@xcite    there is an abundance of experimental and theoretical publications concerning _ circular single _ quantum dots with a small number of electrons .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we use exact diagonalization @xcite ( exd ) to investigate the properties of _ lateral double quantum dots _ ( dqds ) containing four electrons .",
    "dqds are referred to also as artificial molecules . specifically in the case of four electrons they can be viewed as artificial _ quantum dot helium molecules_.@xcite dqds containing two electrons have been already studied extensively both experimentally @xcite and theoretically.@xcite however , experimental studies of dqds with more than two electrons are relatively few.@xcite we are aware of a single theoretical exd study of a lateral dqd with three electrons,@xcite and another one of two laterally coupled quantum rings with three electrons.@xcite    in light of the novel quantum behavior discovered in our investigations ( compared to circular qds with regard to the spectra , spin structures , and analogies with heisenberg clusters ) , we hope that the present work would serve as an impetus for further experimental studies on lateral dqds .",
    "in particular , as a function of the magnetic field , we find that : ( 1 ) a low - energy band of six states develops as the strength of the coulomb repulsion increases , separated by an energy gap from the other excited states , and ( 2 ) all six states appear to `` cross '' at a single value of the magnetic field .",
    "the crossing point gets sharper for larger interdot distances .",
    "we find that the specific number of crossing states ( six ) derives from the spin degeneracies and multiplicities expressed by the branching diagram.@xcite    the formation of the low - energy band is a consequence of the localization of the four electrons within each dot ( with two electrons in each dot ) .",
    "this localization leads to formation ( with increasing strength of the coulomb repulsion ) of a wigner supermolecule,@xcite with the four localized electrons ( two in each dot ) being located at the corners of a rectangular parallelogram ( rp ) . using the spin - resolved pair - correlation functions ,",
    "we show how to map the exd many - body wave functions onto the spin functions associated with the four localized spins .",
    "this mapping leads us naturally to study analogies with finite systems described by a model heisenberg hamiltonian ( often referred to as finite heisenberg clusters ) .",
    "specifically , we provide a detailed interpretation of the exd spin functions and exd spectra associated with the low - energy band via a 4-site finite heisenberg cluster characterized by two ( intradot and interdot ) exchange integrals .    more importantly",
    ", our exd calculations exhibit a prominent oscillatory magnetic - field dependence of the two exchange integrals entering in this 4-site heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "such strong @xmath2-dependence of the exchange integrals has been found in previous theoretical studies in the simpler case of two electrons in double quantum dots , @xcite as well as in anisotropic single quantum dots.@xcite the @xmath2-dependence in the case of two electrons in quantum dots has also been observed experimentally.@xcite following an earlier proposal,@xcite the @xmath2-dependence of the exchange integral for the two - electron case has developed into a central theme in experimental efforts aiming at solid - state implementation of quantum computing.@xcite our exd results in this paper extend the @xmath2-dependence of the exchange integrals to larger numbers @xmath4 of electrons in quantum dot molecules .",
    "we further discuss that the determination of the equivalent spin functions enables consideration of aspects of entanglement regarding the exd solutions .",
    "in particular , we show that the formation of wigner supermolecules leads to strongly entangled states known in the literature of quantum information as @xmath3-qubit dicke states.@xcite    we finally mention that the trends in the excitation spectra ( e.g. , formation of a low - energy band ) and entanglement characteristics ( e.g. , mapping to spin functions of localized electrons ) found in the case of double quantum dots have many analogies with those found in other deformed configurations , and in particular single anisotropic quantum dots ; see , e.g. , the case of three electrons in ref .  .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows :    * section ii describes the two - dimensional two - center - oscillator ( tco ) external confining potential that models the double quantum dot . *",
    "section iii reviews the many - body hamiltonian and the exact - diagonalization method as implemented in this paper .",
    "* section iv outlines some theoretical background regarding the general form of four - electron spin eigenfunctions and the branching diagram ( which describes the break - down of spin multiplicities for given @xmath3 ) . *",
    "section v describes our numerical results from the exact diagonalization , that is , the exd spectra , the electron densities , and the spin - resolved conditional probability distributions ( cpds ) . *",
    "section vi provides an interpretation of the numerical exd results for the 6-state lower - energy band with the help of a 4-site heisenberg hamiltonian . * section",
    "vii contains two parts which discuss ( a ) the importance of @xmath2-dependent exchange integrals in the heisenberg hamiltonian and ( b ) the aspects of entanglement exhibited by the exd wave functions .",
    "* section viii offers a summary . *",
    "finally , the appendix describes the single - particle spectrum of the two - center oscillator ( when the two - body coulomb interaction is omitted ; non - interacting model ) .",
    "in the two - dimensional two - center - oscillator , the single - particle levels associated with the confining potential of the artificial molecule are determined by the single - particle hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 with @xmath7 for @xmath8 ( left ) and @xmath9 for @xmath10 ( right ) , and the @xmath11 s control the relative well - depth , thus allowing studies of hetero - qdms .",

    "we stress here that the ability to describe spin multiplicities is an advantage of the exd method compared to the more familiar spin - density functional approaches whose single - determinantal wave functions preserve only the third projection @xmath89 of the total spin , and thus are subject to `` spin contamination '' errors .",
    "as we will discuss below , the spin multiplicities of the exd wave functions lead naturally to formation of highly entangled dicke states,@xcite and most importantly to analogies with finite heisenberg clusters.@xcite    a basic property of spin eigenfunctions is that they exhibit degeneracies for @xmath114 , i.e. , there may be more than one linearly independent ( and orthogonal ) spin functions that are simultaneous eigenstates of both @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",

    "the interdot barrier parameter was taken as @xmath146 ( because @xmath142 , one has @xmath147 ; see section [ 2dhopot ] for the definitions ) . in all cases , we calculated the eight lowest energy levels .",
    "we observe that the lowest six levels form a band that separates from the rest of the spectrum through the opening of a gap .",
    "this happens already at a relatively weak interelectron repulsion , and it is well developed for the intermediate case ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "it is of interest to note that the number of levels in the band ( six ) coincides with the total number of spin eigenfunctions for @xmath0 fermions , as can be seen from the branching diagram displaying the spin degeneracies . in particular , there is one level with total spin @xmath119 ( and parity @xmath148 ) , three levels with total spin @xmath120 ( two with @xmath148 and one with @xmath149 ) , and two levels with total spin @xmath121 ( one with @xmath148 and the second with @xmath149 ) .",

    "the trends associated with the opening of a gap and the formation of a six - state low band appear further reinforced for the larger interdot distance of @xmath153 nm ( displayed in fig .",
    "[ spd60e05 ] for the three values of the dielectric constant @xmath143 , 6 , and 2 , respectively ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the six lower curves `` cross '' now at a sharply defined point @xcite ( situated at @xmath154 t for @xmath143 , @xmath155 t for @xmath144 , and @xmath156 t for @xmath145 ) .",
    "the six curves demonstrate additional near degeneracies regrouping approximately to three curves before and after the crossing point , which results in a remarkable simplification of the spectrum .    for strong repulsion ( @xmath145 ) ,",
    "all six states in the low band are almost degenerate for both distances [ @xmath157 nm ; see fig .",
    "[ spd30e05](c ) and @xmath153 nm ; see fig .",
    "[ spd60e05](c ) ] .",
    "this is a consequence of the formation of a near - rigid wigner molecule ( wm ) with strongly localized electrons .",
    "namely , the overlaps between the orbitals of localized electrons are very small ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , yielding small exchange contributions in the total energies,@xcite and thus all six possible spin multiplicities tend to become degenerate in energy .",
    "furthermore the physical picture of a near - rigid wigner molecule suggests that the energy gap to the next group of states corresponds to excitation of the lowest stretching vibrational mode of the 4-electron molecule .    since the main panels in figs .",
    "[ spd30e05 ] and [ spd60e05 ] display only the four lowest - in - energy states with positive parity and the four corresponding states with negative parity , one needs a larger part of the spectrum to ascertain whether higher bands are formed . to this end , the inset in fig .",
    "[ spd60e05](c ) displays the twelve lowest - in - energy curves with @xmath158 and the ten corresponding curves with @xmath159 .",
    "in addition to the 6-state low band , the inset indicates formation of a higher band comprising a total of 12 states ( not labeled ) ; however , a detailed study of this higher band falls outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "it is natural to anticipate at this point that the above behavior of the low - energy exd spectra at low @xmath2 can be generalized to an arbitrary number of electrons @xmath3 in a double qd .",
    "namely , as the strength of the interelectron interaction increases , a low - energy band comprising all possible spin multiplicities will form and it will become progressively well separated by an energy gap from the higher excitations .",
    "for example , for @xmath160 , an inspection of the branching diagram in fig.[brandiag ] leads us to the prediction that there will be 20 states in this low - energy band .",
    "a similar behavior emerges also in the case of a _ single _ , but strongly _ anisotropic _ quantum dot ; indeed a low - energy band of three states ( see the branching diagram in fig .  [ brandiag ] ) has been found for @xmath161 electrons in ref .  .",
    "it is of interest to contrast the above behavior of the excitation spectra in a double qd with that of an @xmath3-electron circular dot .",
    "specifically , in the circular qd , large inetelectron repulsion leads to formation of a near - rigid _ rotating _ wigner molecule that exhibits a rigid moment of inertia .",
    "then the states inside the low - energy band ( two states for @xmath162 , three for @xmath161 , six for @xmath0 , etc . ) do not become degenerate in energy , but form an yrast rotational band @xcite specified by @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the total angular momentum and @xmath165 is the classical moment of inertia .",
    "we note that the energy splittings among the yrast rotational states are much smaller than the vibrational energy gap in circular dots associated with the quantum of energy @xmath166 of the stretching ( often referred to as breathing ) mode of the polygonal - ring configuration of the quasiclassical wigner molecule .",

    "specifically it was found ( section [ exdspec ] ) that , as a function of the magnetic field , the energy spectra exhibit a low - energy band consisting of a group of six states , and that this number six is not accidental , but a consequence of the conservation of the total spin and of the ensuing spin degeneracies and supermultiplicities expressed in the branching diagram ( described in section [ mbsfs ] ) .",
    "these six states appear to cross at a single value of the magnetic field , and the crossing point gets sharper for larger interdot distances .",
    "as the strength of the coulomb repulsion increases , the six states tend to become degenerate and a well defined energy gap separates them from the higher - in - energy excited states .",
    "the formation of the low - energy band is a consequence of the localization of the four electrons within each dot ( with two electrons on each dot ) .",
    "the result is formation ( with increasing strength of the coulomb repulsion ) of a wigner supermolecule , with the four localized electrons at the corners of a rectangular parallelogram . using the spin - resolved pair - correlation functions",
    ", it was shown that one can map the exd many - body wave functions to the spin functions associated with four localized spins ( section [ cpdsb0 ] ) .",
    "this mapping led us naturally to studying analogies with finite systems described by model heisenberg hamiltonians ( referred to often as finite heisenberg clusters ) .",
    "specifically , we provided a detailed interpretation of the exd spin functions and exd spectra associated with the low - energy band via a 4-site finite heisenberg cluster characterized by two ( intradot and interdot ) exchange integrals .",
    "more importantly , our exd calculations suggest a prominent oscillatory magnetic - field dependence of the two exchange integrals entering in this 4-site heisenberg hamiltonian ( section [ heis ] ) .",
    "such strong @xmath2-dependence of the exchange integrals has been found in previous theoretical and experimental studies in the simpler case of two electrons in quantum dots , and it has developed into a central theme in experimental efforts aiming at solid - state implementation of quantum computing .",
    "our exd results in this paper extend the @xmath2-dependence of the exchange integrals to larger numbers @xmath4 of electrons in quantum dot molecules ( see discussion in section [ disca ] ) .",
    "finally , it was discussed that the exd spin functions correspond to strongly entangled states known in the literature of quantum information as @xmath3-qubit dicke states ( section [ discb ] ) .",
    "this work was supported by the us d.o.e .",
    "( grant no .",
    "fg05 - 86er45234 ) .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss briefly the energy spectra associated with the single - particle states of the two - center oscillator hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ hsp ] ) .",
    "we follow here the notation presented first in ref .  .",
    "for further details , see ref .  .",
    "the calculated two - center oscillator single - particle spectrum for a double quantum dot made of two tunnel - coupled identical qds ( with @xmath354 mev ) plotted versus the distance , @xmath317 , between the centers of the two dots , is given in fig .",
    "[ espd ] . in these calculations ,",
    "the height of the barrier between the dots varies as a function of @xmath317 , thus simulating reduced tunnel coupling between them as they are separated ; we take the barrier control parameter as @xmath355 . in the calculations in this appendix , we used gaas values , @xmath356 and a dielectric constant @xmath357 . for the separated single qds ( large @xmath317 ) and the unified qd ( @xmath358 ) limits ,",
    "the spectra are the same , corresponding to that of a 2d harmonic oscillator ( being doubly degenerate for the separated single qds ) with a level degeneracy of 1 , 2 , 3 , ... . in analogy with real molecules , the single - particle states in the intermediate region ( @xmath359 )",
    "may be interpreted as molecular orbitals ( mos ) made of linear superpositions of the states of the two dots comprising the dq this qualitative description is intuitively appealing , though it is more appropriate for the weaker coupling regime ( large @xmath317 ) ; nevertheless we continue to use it for the whole range of tunnel - coupling strengths between the dots , including the strong coupling regime where reference to the states of the individual dots is only approximate .",
    "thus , for example , as the two dots approach each other , the lowest levels ( @xmath360 , @xmath361 ) with @xmath362 on the two dots may combine symmetrically ( `` bonding '' ) or antisymmetrically ( `` antibonding '' ) to form [ 0,0;0 ] and [ 0,0;1 ] mos , with the third index denoting the total number of nodes of the mo along the interdot axis ( @xmath13 ) , that is , @xmath363 , @xmath364 0 or 1 ; for symmetric combinations ( @xmath365 ) , this index is even and for antisymmetric ones ( @xmath366 ) , it is odd . between the separated - single - qds and the unified - qd limits , the degeneracies of the individual dots states",
    "are lifted , and in correlating these two limits the number of @xmath13-nodes is conserved ; for example the [ 0,0;1 ] mo converts in the unified - qd limit into the ( 1,0 ) state of a single qd , the [ 1,0;2 ] mo into the ( 2,0 ) state , and the [ 0,1;1 ] mo into the ( 1,1 ) state ( see fig .",
    "[ espd ] ) .",
    "note that mos of different symmetries may cross , while they do not if they are of the same symmetry .    in a magnetic field ,",
    "the tco model consitutes a generalization of the darwin - fock model @xcite for non - interacting electrons in a single circular qd .",
    "the single - particle spectra for the dqd ( @xmath367 nm , @xmath368 mev ) in a magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ espb ] ( here we neglect the zeeman interaction which is small for our range of @xmath2 values with @xmath369 for gaas ) .",
    "the main features are : ( i ) the multiple crossings ( and avoided crossings ) as @xmath2 increases , ( ii ) the decrease of the energy gap between levels , occurring in pairs ( such as the lowest bonding - antibonding pair ) , portraying an effective reduced tunnel coupling between the qds comprising the dqd as @xmath2 increases , ( iii ) the `` condensation '' of the spectrum into the sequence of landau levels @xmath370 , @xmath371 0 , 1 , 2 , ... ( the @xmath372 and @xmath373 bands are depicted , respectively , by the lower and upper dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ espb ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the behavior of the single - particle darwin - fock spectrum for harmonically confined electrons in a circular qd @xcite ( note however that the geometry of the dqd is non - circular and deviates from a simple harmonic confinement ) .",
