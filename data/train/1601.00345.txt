    "<S> this is in remarkable agreement with the theory which predicts a saturation value of @xmath66 proportional to the debye length @xcite , and fully consistent with the expectation that a thicker layer is more difficult to bend . as @xmath80 also fixes independently cutoff frequencies via water conductivity , </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that the effect on tension results from an amplification of charge fluctuations at the membrane.the effect on rigidity comes from couplings inside the electric double layer , and can only be understood by using the full non- linear poisson - boltzmann theory . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of voltage and ac field frequency has been characterized . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between the stabilizing effect on bending rigidity ( mainly acting at lengthscales @xmath90 ) and destabilizing effect on tension ( at lengthscales @xmath91 ) leads to @xmath92 vesicle formation as observed . </S>",
