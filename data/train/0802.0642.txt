    "the problem of separating the two components of the radio continuum emission , free - free ( thermal ) and synchrotron ( nonthermal ) emission , dates back to the beginnings of radio astronomy .",
    "the usually applied technique is based on the assumption of a constant nonthermal spectral index .",
    "although this assumption may be reasonable for global studies , it does not lead to a correct thermal / nonthermal distribution in detailed studies , and it is not possible to investigate the origin and energy - loss processes of the electron component of cosmic rays ( crs ) .",
    "the dust color temperature obtained between mips 70@xmath0 m and 160@xmath0 m ( tabatabaei et al .",
    "2007a ) shows variations between 19k and 28k with a most probable value at 21.5k .",
    "using the 160@xmath0 m column density and the dust temperature maps , we mapped the dust optical depth at 160@xmath0 m and then at h@xmath1 wavelength ( @xmath2 ) . in the extended central region and in the two main arms in and is , @xmath3 0.5 and between 0.2 and 0.4 in other arms .",
    "we found a radial gradient for the mean extinction in rings given by : @xmath4 . assuming a homogeneous distribution of the emitting and attenuating medium in the line of sight ( for @xmath50.4kpc spatial resolution ) , we de - reddened the observed h@xmath1 emission ( tabatabaei et al .",
    "we found that less than 25% of the total h@xmath1 emission is obscured by dust in m33 . the intrinsic h@xmath1 emission measure converted to the thermal radio emission ( assuming recombination case - b , e.g. dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ) . subtracting the thermal emission from the observed 3.6 cm and 20 cm emission ( tabatabaei et al . ,",
    "2007b ) , the nonthermal maps were derived .",
    "we obtained a total thermal fraction of @xmath617% at 20 cm and @xmath650% at 3.6 cm for galactocentric radii r@xmath77.5kpc .",
    "the nonthermal emission is more smoothly distributed than the thermal emission .",
    "furthermore , the structure of the nonthermal emission is smoother at 20 cm than at 3.6 cm , indicating a stronger diffuse component of the synchrotron emission ( in the form of a diffuse disk or halo ) at 20 cm ( see also tabatabaei et al .",
    "using the nonthermal maps at 20 and 3.6 cm , the nonthermal spectral index map was obtained . in the star forming regions ,",
    "the nonthermal spectrum is relatively flat with an average value of 0.6@xmath80.1 , the typical spectral index of supernova remnants , but it increases to 1.2@xmath80.2 in the interarm regions and outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "this indicates energy losses of the relativistic electrons while they diffuse away from their origin in starforming regions towards the interarm regions and the outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "for the first time , a nonthermal spectral index map can be used to achieve more realistic models for the propagation of cr electrons . figure .",
    "1 shows that the total radio emission is mostly nonthermal at r@xmath94.5 kpc in m33 , where the spectral index is dominated by synchrotron and inverse compton loss .",
