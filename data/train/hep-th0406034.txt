    "in an attempt to unify electrodynamics and general relativity , kaluza introduced an extra , a fifth dimension @xcite and assumed all fields to be independent of the extra dimension .",
    "klein @xcite followed this idea , however , he assumed the fifth dimension to be compactified on a circle of planck length .",
    "the resulting theory describes @xmath0-dimensional einstein gravity plus maxwell s equations .",
    "one of the new fields appearing in this model is the dilaton , a scalar companion of the metric tensor . in an analogue way",
    ", this field arises in the low energy effective action of superstring theories and is associated with the classical scale invariance of these models @xcite .    both string theories @xcite as well as",
    "so - called `` brane worlds '' @xcite assume that space - time possesses more than four dimensions .",
    "in string theories , these extra dimensions are -following the idea of klein- compactified on a scale of the planck length , while in brane worlds , which assume the standard model fields to be confined on a 3-brane , they are large and even infinite",
    ". it should thus be interesting to study classical solutions of non - abelian gauge theories in higher dimensions .",
    "an einstein - yang - mills model in @xmath1 dimensions was studied recently @xcite . assuming the metric and matter fields to be independent on the extra coordinates",
    ", an effective 4-dimensional einstein - yang - mills - higs - dilaton model appears with one higgs triplet and one scalar dilaton .",
    "this idea was taken further to @xmath2 dimensions @xcite , where @xmath3 higgs triplets and @xmath3 dilatons appear .",
    "in contrast to one extra dimension , however , it appeared that in two or more extra dimensions , constraints result from the off - diagonal terms of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this leads to the fact that only solutions with either only one non - zero higgs field or with all higgs fields constant are allowed . in this paper",
    ", we study an einstein - yang - mills model in @xmath4 dimensions and we introduce an off - diagonal term in the metric associated with the extra dimensions in order to be able to obtain non - trivial solutions .",
    "we introduce the model in section ii and give the ansatz and equations of motion in section iii . in section iv , we give the 4-dimensional effective action from which the equations of motion can equally well be derived . in section",
    "v , we present our numerical results and finally , in section vi we give our conclusions .",

    "we will study globally regular , asymptotically flat solutions of the system above .",

    "the function @xmath20 appears as a new dynamical scalar field in the effective action .",
    "the system of non - linear differential equations can only be solved numerically .",
    "we have solved this system for numerous values of @xmath66 . for the numerical analysis",
    "we assume @xmath67 , but we believe that the pattern of solutions remains qualitatively equal for @xmath68 . in the limit @xmath69 the metric is flat ( minkowski metric ) ( implying @xmath70 ) and the solution of the equations is the t hooft - polyakov magnetic monopole @xcite . due to the presence of two -linearly superposed- higgs fields , the flat solution has mass @xmath71 , which is confirmed by our numerical results . for @xmath72 the solution is progressively deformed by gravity , the fields @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 become non - trivial .",
    "in particular , @xmath76 develops a local minimum at some finite radius @xmath77 , @xmath78 represents the minimum of the function @xmath75 , the dilaton field @xmath79 is negative and monotonically increasing , while the function @xmath73 is positive and decreases monotonically from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "the profiles of the different functions is presented in fig.[fi45f1 ] for two different values of @xmath66 .",
    "this figure shows that @xmath82 is larger than @xmath83 .",
    "the values @xmath84 and @xmath85 are plotted as functions of @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fi45f2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fi45f4 ] , respectively .",
    "the branch which arises from the gravitational deformation of the flat monopole is indexed by the label `` 1 '' in the figures . in fig.[fi45f2 ] we also plot the adm mass of the solution , which decreases with increasing @xmath66 .",
    "the figures further demonstrate that the branch `` 1 '' of solutions does not exist for arbitrary large values of @xmath66 .",
    "rather , the solutions exist only for @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , another branch of solutions exists for @xmath88 .",
    "more precisely , we have managed to construct a second branch of solution ( labelled `` 2 '' in the figures ) for @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) .",
    "again , starting from @xmath91 and increasing @xmath66 , our numerical analysis strongly suggests the existence of a third branch labelled `` 3 '' .",
    "note that the adm mass of the solutions of branch `` 3 '' is very close to that of the solutions of branch `` 2 '' .",
    "this is why the two branches can not be distinguished on the plot as far as their adm mass is concerned . continuing this construction ,",
    "there probably exist a large ( possibly infinite ) number of branches on smaller and smaller intervals concentrated around the value @xmath92 .",
    "this pattern is very reminiscent to the one occuring in the case with @xmath93 first discussed by volkov @xcite .",
    "however the behaviour of the mass of the solutions in the @xmath93 case and in the @xmath5 cases is considerably different . indeed , for @xmath93 ,",
    "the mass of the solutions on the branches `` 2'',``3 '' is higher than the mass of the solution on the branch `` 1 '' ; in the present case , it is the contrary .",
    "said in other words , for @xmath94 the solution with the lowest mass is the one of branch `` 2 '' .    at first glance",
    "this result may appear paradoxal , since it is known that the monopole is topologically stable .",
    "however , we believe that this peculiar behaviour of the mass is deeply connected to the direct coupling between the two higgs fields in the effective action . roughly speaking the two higgs fields",
    "are coupled with a factor @xmath95 ( remember that this term is absent in absence of gravity @xmath96 ) . for @xmath97",
    "it turns out that the three contributions due to the terms quadratic in the derivative of the higgs fields have a tendency to compensate . for",
    "the solutions of the second branch , the dilatons @xmath98 and the function @xmath73 deviate stronger from their flat space - time values than on the branch `` 1 '' .",
    "specifically , @xmath73 becomes large enough to dimnish considerably the contribution of the higgs field to the mass . as a consequence , the mass becomes smaller than the mass on the first branch .    analyzing this result from the point of view of catastrophe theory it it tempting to conclude that the solutions on the branch `` 1 '' are unstable ( they are sphaleron - like ) and it is very likely that the monopole looses its non - trivial topology and its status of being a local minimum when it is coupled to the other fields appearing in the 4-dimensional effective model .",
    "there are @xmath99 negative -unstable- modes while the solution of branch `` 2 '' have @xmath100 unstable modes .",
    "a direct analysis of the stability should definitely confirm this conclusion and provide the value of @xmath99 .",
    "the dimensional reduction of the einstein - yang - mills theory from @xmath2 dimensions down to the standard @xmath0 dimensions is an interesting problem .",
    "the main source of uncertainty is the way the fields depend on the extra dimensions .",
    "one can adopt , for the simplest case , the point of view that , in an appropriate gauge and with appropriate variables , the gauge and metric fields are independent on the extra coordinates .",
    "a 4-dimensional effective action which encodes all the effects of the extra dimension into a more or less `` conventional '' field theory can then be constructed .    in the case of @xmath101",
    ", it was shown that the effective action is a georgi - glashow model appropriately coupled to one dilaton field @xcite .",
    "here we have studied in details the case @xmath102 .",
    "one of the main differences in comparison to the @xmath101 case is that the einstein - yang - mills equations are consistent only if the metric has off - diagonal terms in the subspace of the extra dimensions .",
    "the corresponding effective action is a standard einstein - yang - mills action supplemented by two higgs triplets and three scalar fields , originating from the parametrization of the metric in the codimensions .",
    "the function corresponding to the off - diagonal term of the metric plays a very important role in the effective action , largely determining an interaction between the two higgs fields .",
    "all these fields acquire kinetic parts as well as specific interactions .",
    "several possibilities of extension of the result can be investigated , namely ( 1 ) the construction of non - abelian black hole , ( 2 ) the stability analysis of the different branches of regular solutions , ( 3 ) the addition of higher order terms in the yang - mills action ( `` born - infeld '' terms ) and ( 4 ) the construction of axially symmetric solutions .",
