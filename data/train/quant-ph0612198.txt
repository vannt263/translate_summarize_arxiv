    "quantum correlations have been the subject of intensive investigations and sub - shot - noise in photon - number correlations have been indeed observed through the generation of the so - called _ twin - beam _ of light .",
    "so far twin - beams have been obtained in the macroscopic regime from parametric oscillators @xcite or from seeded parametric amplifiers @xcite and , with much lower photon numbers , from traveling - wave optical parametric amplifiers ( opa ) @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations between light beams play a crucial role in fundamental quantum optics @xcite and find applications in quantum cryptography @xcite and communication @xcite , spectroscopy @xcite , interferometry @xcite , as well as in enhancing sensitivity in imaging @xcite and high - precision measurements @xcite .",
    "ideal twin - beam states , as those generated by traveling - wave opa starting from vacuum , exhibit perfect quantum correlations in the photon number for any average photon number , whereas approximations to them can be obtained by optical parametric oscillators ( opo ) , where the increased intensity is obtained at the price of introducing additional noise . on the other hand , existence of quantum correlations in mesoscopic / macroscopic twin - beam states may be demonstrated for continuous - wave opos via indirect measurements of the difference photocurrent , upon spectral filtering , by analysis in a narrow frequency bandwidth .",
    "these procedures directly give the amount of noise reduction in the system but lose information on the number of photons in each party of the twin - beam . notice that opo - based systems are unavoidably spatially multimode @xcite , as it is shown by the poissonian distribution of the intensities of signal and idler .",
    "the shot - noise limit ( snl ) in any photodetection process is defined as the lowest level of noise that can be obtained by using semiclassical states of light , that is glauber coherent states .",
    "if one measures the photon numbers of two beams and evaluates their difference , the snl is the lower limit of the noise that can be reached when the beams are classically correlated . on the other hand , when intensity correlations below snl are observed , we have a genuine quantum effect .    in this paper",
    "we present the demonstration of sub - shot noise correlations in a twin - beam obtained from a pulsed opa starting from the vacuum state .",
    "our scheme involves a traveling - wave opa not operated at frequency degeneracy .",
    "the resulting twin - beam are mesoscopic ( more than @xmath0 detected photons ) and sub - shot noise correlations have been demonstrated by direct measurement of the number of photons in the two parties of the twin state .",
    "this procedure yields complete information on the photon statistics and makes the system available for applications , such as the production of conditional states , which is actually feasible as described in the following .",
    "notice that in our system we selected single coherence twin areas in the signal and idler light in order to match the single - mode theoretical description and demonstrated that this experimental condition minimizes the amount of detected spurious light and maximizes the quantum noise reduction .",
    "the scheme is conceptually simple : the signal and idler beams at the output of the amplifier are individually measured by direct detection .",
    "the resulting photon - counts , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are highly correlated , are subtracted from each other to demonstrate quantum noise reduction in the difference @xmath3 .",
    "we calculate the variance of the difference , @xmath4 , and show that @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the average numbers of detected photons in the two output beams .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is the snl , _",
    "i.e _ the value of @xmath4 that would be obtained for uncorrelated coherent beams .    , @xmath9 : converging lenses ; ph@xmath10 , 100 @xmath11 m diameter pin - holes ; d@xmath10 , pin detectors ; bp@xmath10 , band - pass filters ; nd , variable neutral - density filter . the boxes on the right side of the figure indicate the parts of the signal amplification and acquisition chains.,width=283 ]",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in fig .  [ setup ] . a frequency - tripled continuous - wave ( cw ) mode - locked nd : ylf laser regeneratively amplified at a repetition rate of 500 hz ( high q laser production , hohenems , austria ) produces linearly polarized pump pulses at 349 nm with pulse duration of 4.45 ps , as calculated from that of the fundamental pulse @xcite .",
    "after passing through a @xmath12-mm focal - length lens the pump beam comes to a focus ( diameter @xmath13 @xmath11 m ) at the position where a 4-mm - thick uncoated @xmath14-bab@xmath15o@xmath16 crystal ( bbo i ) is placed ( fujian castech crystals , fuzhou , china ) .",
    "the crystal is cut for type i interaction at a 38.4-deg angle and it is adjusted to yield efficient parametric amplification of a cw he - ne laser beam at 632.8 nm that hits the crystal at a 5.85-deg angle ( external angle ) to the pump beam . after the bbo i , at distances d@xmath17 cm and d@xmath18 cm respectively , two pin - holes of 100 @xmath11 m diameter are positioned so as to be centered with the amplified signal beam at 632.8 nm and with the idler beam at 778.2 nm .",
    "the two different values chosen for the distances compensate the difference in the divergence of signal and idler related to their wavelengths .",
    "stray light is blocked by two suitable band - pass filters , bp@xmath19 and bp@xmath15 , placed before the pin - holes while the light transmitted by the pin - holes is conveyed to the detectors , d@xmath19 and d@xmath15 , by two 25-mm focal - length lenses that are placed just beyond the pin - holes . the interaction seeded by the cw light at the signal wavelength",
    "is only used for the preliminary alignment of the pin - holes .",
    "the d@xmath19 and d@xmath15 detectors are pin photodiodes ( s5973 - 02 and s3883 , hamamatsu photonics k.k . ,",
    "japan ) with nominal quantum efficiencies of 86@xmath20 and 90@xmath20 at the signal and idler wavelengths , respectively .",
    "as the combinations of detectors and band - pass filters yield detection efficiencies of 55.0@xmath20 in the signal arm and of 57.6@xmath20 in the idler arm , the latter is lowered by adding an adjustable neutral - density filter , nd in fig .",
    "[ setup ] , in order to obtain the same overall detection efficiency , @xmath21 , on both arms .",
    "the current outputs of the detectors are amplified by means of low - noise charge - sensitive pre - amplifiers ( cr-110 , cremat , watertown , ma ) followed by amplifiers ( cr-200 - 4 @xmath11s , cremat , watertown , ma ) , which are identical in the two arms .",
    "the two amplified outputs are integrated over gates of 15 @xmath11s duration synchronized with the pump pulse by gated int@xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ setup ] ( sr250 , stanford research systems , palo alto , ca ) .",
    "the voltage outputs are sampled , digitized and recorded by a computer .",
    "accurate calibrations of the voltage outputs per electron in the detector current pulses give 33.087 @xmath11v / el for the d@xmath19 arm and 24.803 @xmath11v / el for the d@xmath15 arm .",
    "all the data presented in this letter are in units of electrons in the d@xmath19 and d@xmath15 output current pulses , thus corresponding to the number of photons detected in the signal and idler pulses .",
    "the size of the pin - holes and their distance from the crystal have been chosen so as to collect twin spatial modes in the downconversion pattern .",
    "in fact , the size of coherence areas in the downconverted light depends on the pump intensity @xcite . in single - photon experiments",
    "this fact usually does not affect the measurement of correlations since the probability of accidental coincidences is very low .",
    "on the other hand , when many photons are involved , one should carefully select twin modes , _",
    "i.e. _ twin coherence areas . in our measurements , we have optimized the collection of the light by fixing distances and sizes of the pin - holes and maximizing correlations against the pump intensity .",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ correl ] ) must be corrected by taking into account the presence of noise , both in terms of possible correlation and in terms of increased variance .",
    "in fact , typical values of the noise r.m.s . were @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for the data in the inset , we obtained a value of the correlation coefficient @xmath33 that indicates a high degree of the correlation .",
    ", measured over @xmath34 subsequent laser shots . , width=302 ]    as we emphasized in @xcite , a high value of correlation is not sufficient to discriminate between quantum and classical correlations since in both cases @xmath35 .",
    "an explicit marker of nonclassicality can be obtained by considering the distribution of the photon - count difference @xmath36 , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ diff ] for the same data displayed in the inset of fig  [ corr ] .",
    "the distribution appears symmetrical and centered at zero , which indicates both accurate balance of the overall efficiencies of the detectors and high correlation in signal / idler photon numbers . in order to assess the nonclassicality of the twin - beam , we calculate the quantum noise reduction @xmath37 @xmath38 where , as in the case of the correlation function",
    ", the variance of the photon - count difference must be corrected for the electronic noise in the absence of light @xmath39 .    in principle , we have quantum noise reduction whenever the noise reduction falls in the range @xmath40 and the whole range is achievable . on the other hand , in order to assess quantitatively the quantum noise reduction , the overall detection efficiency @xmath41 , which somewhat degrades the observed correlations , should be taken into account . by assuming that both arms of the measurement have the same efficiency and that dark counts have been already subtracted , the probability operator - valued measure ( povm ) of each detector is given by a bernoullian convolution of the ideal number operator spectral measure @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "the joint distribution of detected photons @xmath44 in the idler and signal beams can be evaluated by tracing over the density matrix of the two modes , while the moments of the distribution are evaluated by means of the operators @xmath45 where @xmath46 . of course , since @xmath47 are operatorial moments of a povm , we have , in general , @xmath48 .",
    "the first two moments correspond to the operators @xmath49 as a consequence , the variances of the two photocurrents are larger than the corresponding photon number variances .",
    "we have @xmath50",
    "using this relations we may evaluate the expected noise reduction , which , for our multimode twin - beam obtained by spontaneous down - conversion , is given by @xmath51 independently of the gain of the amplifier .    if @xmath52 the field displays nonclassical correlations @xcite , whereas @xmath53 marks the boundary between classical and nonclassical behaviors .",
    "for the data in fig .",
    "[ corr ] , which correspond to maximum noise reduction , we get a value @xmath54 db below snl .",
    "notice that given the overall detection efficiency @xmath55 ( @xmath56 db ) , this is almost the maximum detectable noise reduction and corresponds to an ideal noise reduction ( corrected for the quantum efficiency , _",
    "i.e. _ measured by @xmath57-efficient detectors at the output of the crystal ) equal to @xmath58 db .",
    "notice also that the use of spontaneous ( not seeded ) downconversion allows us to have a quantum noise reduction that is independent of the gain of the parametric amplifier .",
    "in fact , for an amplifier seeded by a coherent signal @xcite the noise reduction is expected to be @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the amplitude of the coherent seed and @xmath61 is the gain of the opa .",
    "for @xmath62 we have @xmath63 and sub - shot - noise correlations may be observed only for high - gain amplifiers .    the study of @xmath37 as a function of the pump intensity represents an useful criterion for the selection of a single coherence area . to this aim , in fig .",
    "[ subshot ] we show the values of @xmath37 measured by keeping fixed the collection areas ( same pin - holes located at the same distances as for the data in the previous figures ) and by varying the intensity of the pumping beam .",
    "the figure shows that there is an optimum condition at which @xmath37 is minimum .",
    "in fact , increasing the pump intensity leads to the enlargement of the coherence areas so that they are only partially transmitted by the pin - holes ( values on the right side of fig .",
    "[ subshot ] with respect to the minimum ) . on the contrary",
    ", lowering the pump intensity reduces the size of the coherence areas and hence introduces uncorrelated light in the pin - holes ( values on the left side of fig .",
    "[ subshot ] with respect to the minimum ) .",
    "note that the values of @xmath37 corresponding to the selection of more than a single coherence area remain below the snl or quite close to it as the information contained in the twin areas is not lost , but only made more noisy . on the other hand , selecting only part of the areas causes a loss of information thus determining an abrupt increase of @xmath37 above the snl .",
    "we interpret this result as an indication of the need of perfect matching of the pin - hole areas in order to obtain sub - shot noise correlations the coherence areas with .",
    "note that , as the detected twin - beam is dichromatic , errors in the positioning of the pin - holes do not affect the two parties of the twinbeam in the same way .",
    "( in units of db ) as a function of the average number of detected photons in the signal and idler beams .",
    "solid and dashed lines denote the shot - noise level and the minimum value @xmath64 of the noise reduction , respectively .",
    "error bars are within the size of the plotted points.,width=302 ]    the results reported so far demonstrate the sub - shot - noise , _",
    "i.e. _ quantum , nature of the intensity correlations in our twin - beam .",
    "these features should not be confused with the presence of entanglement , which , though expected in our system , can not be claimed on the basis of the present measurements ( a direct evidence of entanglement would be achievable by measuring two conjugated quadratures by homodyne detection ) .",
    "the correlated states produced by our system are suitable to generate mesoscopic single - beam nonclassical states by conditional measurements @xcite .",
    "the conditional measurement is made as follows : the number of detected photons in the idler , @xmath2 , is kept only if the number of detected photons in the signal , @xmath1 , falls into a specific interval @xmath65 far from its mean value .",
    "the conditional distribution @xmath66 is reported in fig .  [",
    "f : condm ] together with the unconditional marginal distribution @xmath67 , @xmath68 being the joint idler - signal photon distribution .",
    "the narrowing of the conditional distribution below the snl is apparent .",
    "the fano factor ( @xmath69 ) of the idler conditional distribution , suitably corrected for the noise , is given by @xmath70 ( to be compared to that of the corresponding unconditional marginal distribution @xmath71 ) , which corresponds to a noise reduction of about @xmath72 db below the single - beam shot - noise level .",
    "the probability of success , _ i.e. _ the fraction of data that are kept to build the distribution is @xmath73 .",
    "the success probability may be increased by enlarging the interval of acceptance , at the price of increasing the fano factor , which goes above unity if the acceptance window is too large or closer to the mean value of the unconditional distribution @xcite .     for the idler beam ( solid columns ) , as obtained by selecting detected signal photon in the interval @xmath65 indicated in the inset .",
    "we also report the idler unconditional marginal distribution ( patterned gray).,width=302 ]    our detection scheme , being based on direct detection of the photons in the two arms of the twin - beam , is somehow more noisy as compared to the schemes adopted in @xcite , which make use of electronic subtraction of the pin photocurrents of signal and idler . on the other hand , our technique has the advantage of keeping the information about the marginal probability distributions , whose data can be used for state conditioning / engineering by post - selection on one of the two parties .",
    "of course , when the information on the marginal distributions is not required , the direct measurement of the difference photocurrent is preferable .",
    "our technique , being based on the ability of properly selecting the twin coherence areas , provides a system suitable for many applications exploiting the sub - shot - noise correlations of the twin - beam @xcite .",
    "indeed , the twin - beam may be used as a maximally effective probe to reveal either tiny displacements imposed by light - matter interactions or by external perturbations .",
    "for instance , one can implement absorption measurements of weakly absorbing samples by looking at the degradation of the noise reduction or at the variation of the fano factor in conditional measurements , thus improving the performances of single - mode techniques @xcite . in this framework , the fact that the twin - beam is dichromatic , and hence its two parties are tunable in frequency , is undoubtedly relevant .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the possibility of obtaining sub - shot - noise intensity correlations in the ps - pulsed mesoscopic regime by properly selecting the twin coherence areas on the parties of the twin - beam .",
    "our system , which is based on spontaneous downconversion , does not suffer from limitations due to the finite gain of the parametric process and allows us to demonstrate conditional generation of sub - poissonian light .",
    "the mesoscopic nature of our twin - beams makes them a promising system to reveal the presence of small perturbations , _",
    "e.g. _ weakly absorbing biological samples , in a non - destructive illumination regime suitable to preserve even photolabile compounds .",
