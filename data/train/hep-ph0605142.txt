    "the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) is attractive as one of the simplest extensions of the standard model that admits additional cp violation @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting possibility , given the unexplained baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , and the possibility of exploring relevant , new physics at the lhc @xcite . in particular , the model can lead to cp violation in @xmath5 production , a process which has received considerable theoretical attention @xcite , since it will become possible to severely constrain or even measure it .",
    "cp violation can be induced in @xmath5 production at the one - loop level , by the exchange of neutral higgs bosons which are not eigenstates under cp .",
    "this effect is only large enough to be of experimental interest if the neutral higgs bosons are reasonably light , and have strong couplings to the top quarks .    within the 2hdm ( ii ) , where the top quark gets its mass from coupling to the higgs field @xmath6 @xcite ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : yukawa ] ) , the condition of having sizable @xmath7 couplings forces us to consider small values of @xmath0 . a first exploration of this limit was presented in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the general conditions for measurability of cp violation in @xmath8 at the lhc @xcite were found to be satisfied in a certain region of the 2hdm parameter space .",
    "in addition to having small @xmath0 , in order to have a measurable signal with a realistic amount of data ( of the order of a million @xmath5 events ) , it was found necessary that the lightest neutral higgs boson be light , and that the spectrum not be approximately degenerate .",
    "in fact , it was found that in the most favourable observable considered , the effect would not reach the per mil level unless there is one and only one higgs boson below the @xmath5 threshold , and that @xmath0 is at most of order unity .",
    "we here extend the analysis of @xcite to the more general case , allowing the most general quartic couplings in the potential .    at small @xmath0 ,",
    "also certain yukawa couplings to charged higgs bosons are enhanced .",
    "such couplings contribute to effects that are known experimentally to very high precision .",
    "in particular , at low @xmath0 the @xmath9@xmath10 oscillation data and the effective @xmath11 coupling , measured via @xmath12 @xcite severely constrain the model , whereas the @xmath13 data @xcite constrain it at low @xmath14 . furthermore , the high - precision measurement of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 masses , as expressed via @xmath17 @xcite constrains the splitting of the higgs mass spectrum . unless there are cancellations",
    ", the charged higgs boson can not be very much heavier than the lightest neutral one , and the lightest neutral one can not be far away from the mass scale of the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "also , the lightest one is constrained by the direct searches at lep @xcite .",
    "we shall here study the interplay of these constraints , and estimate the amount of cp violation that may be measurable at the lhc in selected favorable regions of the remaining parameter space .",
    "an important characteristic of the 2hdm ( as opposed to the mssm @xcite ) is the fact that , at the level of the mathematics , the masses of the neutral and the charged higgs bosons are rather independent ( see sect .  [ sect:2hdmreview ] ) .",
    "however , the experimental precision on @xmath18 ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : lep - rho ] ) forces the charged higgs mass to be comparable in magnitude to the neutral higgs masses .",
    "another important difference is that whereas small values of @xmath0 are practically excluded in the mssm @xcite , in the 2hdm , which has more free parameters , they are not .    for a recent comprehensive discussion of the experimental constraints on the 2hdm ( though mostly restricted to the cp - conserving limit ) , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter study , which considers the cp - conserving limit , concludes that the model is practically excluded , with the muon anomalous moment being very constraining .",
    "however , the interpretation of the data is now considered less firm , and furthermore , that study focuses on large @xmath0 , and is thus less relevant for the present work .",

    "[ sect : summary ] contains a summary and conclusions .",
    "the 2hdm may be seen as an unconstrained version of the higgs sector of the mssm . while at tree level the latter can be parametrized in terms of only two parameters , conventionally taken to be @xmath0 and @xmath21",
    ", the 2hdm has much more freedom .",
    "in particular , the neutral and charged higgs masses are rather independent .    traditionally , the 2hdm is defined in terms of the potential .",
    "the parameters of the potential ( quartic and quadratic couplings ) determine the masses of the neutral and the charged higgs bosons .",
    "alternatively , and this is the approach followed here and in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can take masses and mixing angles as input , and determine parameters of the potential as derived quantities .",
    "this approach highlights the fact that the neutral and charged sectors are rather independent , as well as masses being physically more accessible than quartic couplings .",
    "however , some choices of input will lead to physically acceptable potentials , others will not . this way , the two sectors remain correlated .",
    "in addition , the 2hdm neutral sector may or may not lead to cp violation , depending on the choice of potential .",
    "we shall here consider the so - called model ii , where @xmath22-type quarks acquire masses from a yukawa coupling to one higgs doublet , @xmath6 , whereas the @xmath23-type quarks couple to the other , @xmath24 .",
    "this structure is the same as in the mssm .",
    "the amount of cp violation that can be measured in @xmath5 production was related to the higgs mass spectrum and other model parameters in @xcite . in that paper , the higgs potential studied was parametrized as @xcite @xmath25   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\{m_{11}^2(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1 ) + \\left[m_{12}^2 ( \\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)+{\\rm h.c.}\\right ] + m_{22}^2(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expanding the higgs - doublet fields as @xmath26   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(v_i+\\eta_i+i\\chi_i ) \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] and choosing phases of @xmath27 such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both real @xcite , it is convenient to define @xmath30 orthogonal to the neutral goldstone boson @xmath31 . in the basis @xmath32 , the resulting mass - squared matrix @xmath33 of the neutral sector ,",

    "@xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath42 is chosen such that in the limit of no cp violation ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) then @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the familiar mixing angle of the cp - even sector , and the additional @xmath47 provides the mapping @xmath48 , instead of @xmath49 being in the @xmath50 position of @xmath51 , as is used in the mssm @xcite .",
    "while the signs of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fixed by our choice of taking the vacuum expectation values real and positive @xcite , the phase of @xmath54 has no physical consequence .",
    "one may therefore freely change the sign of one or more rows , e.g. , let @xmath55 ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : rotation - symmetries ] ) .    rather than describing the phenomenology in terms of the parameters of the potential ( [ eq : pot - ko ] ) , in @xcite the physical mass of the charged higgs boson , as well as those of the two lightest neutral ones , were taken as input , together with the rotation matrix @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the input can be summarized as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "this approach provides better control of the physical content of the model .",
    "in particular , the elements @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the rotation matrix must be non - zero in order to yield cp violation .",
    "for consistency , this requires @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( as derived quantities ) to be non - zero .      for the potential , in this study , we take @xmath65(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2 ) + { \\rm h.c.}\\right\\}.\\ ] ] the new terms proportional to @xmath66 and @xmath67 have to be carefully constrained , since this potential does not satisfy natural flavour conservation @xcite , even if each doublet is coupled only to up - type or only to down - type flavours .",
