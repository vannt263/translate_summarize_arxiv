    "one of the most challenging problems in mathematical fluid dynamics is to understand whether a solution of the 3d incompressible euler equations can develop a finite time singularity from smooth initial data with finite energy .",
    "a main difficulty is due to the presence of the vortex stretching term , which has a formal quadratic nonlinearity in vorticity .",
    "this problem has attracted a lot of attention in the mathematics community and many people have contributed to its understanding , see the recent book by majda and bertozzi @xcite for a review of this subject .",
    "an important development in recent years is the work by constantin , fefferman , and majda who showed that the local geometric regularity of vortex lines can lead to depletion of nonlinear vortex stretching @xcite .",
    "inspired by the work of @xcite , deng , hou , and yu @xcite obtained more localized non - blowup criteria by exploiting the geometric regularity of a vortex line segment whose arclength may shrink to zero at the potential singularity time . to obtain these results ,",
    "deng - hou - yu @xcite used a lagrangian approach and explored the connection between the local geometric regularity of vortex lines and the growth of vorticity .",
    "guided by this local geometric non - blowup analysis , hou and li @xcite performed large scale computations with resolution up to @xmath0 to re - examine some of the most well - known blow - up scenarios , including the two slightly perturbed anti - parallel vortex tubes that was originally investigated by kerr @xcite .",
    "the computations of hou and li @xcite provide strong numerical evidence that the geometric regularity of vortex lines , even in an extremely localized region near the support of maximum vorticity , can lead to depletion of vortex stretching .",
    "we refer to a recent survey paper @xcite for more discussions on this topic .    in this paper",
    ", we derive new growth rate estimates of maximum vorticity for the 3d incompressible euler equations .",
    "we use a framework similar to that adopted by deng - hou - yu @xcite .",
    "the main innovation of this work is to introduce a method of analysis to study the dynamic evolution of the integral of the absolute value of vorticity along a local vortex line segment . specifically , we derive a dynamic estimate for the quantity : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a parameterization of a vortex line segment , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the arclength of @xmath3 .",
    "the assumption on @xmath2 is less restrictive than that in @xcite . as in @xcite , we assume that the vorticity along @xmath3 is comparable to the maximum vorticity , i.e. @xmath5 .",

    ", we derive a relatively sharp growth estimate for @xmath12 , which can be used to obtain an upper bound on the growth rate of the maximum vorticity : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 depend on @xmath16 .",
    "if we further assume that @xmath4 has a positive lower bound , the above estimate implies no blow - up up to @xmath17 , if @xmath18 .",
    "this generalizes the result of cordoba and fefferman @xcite .",
    "the above estimate extends the result of deng - hou - yu in @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is easy to check that under the assumption that @xmath19 and @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the right hand side of ( [ vorticity_growth ] ) remains bounded up to the time @xmath17 , implying no blow - up up to @xmath17 .",
    "our result can be also applied to the critical case when @xmath22 , which was considered in @xcite . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath23 if we further assume that there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 depends on @xmath16 , and the scaling constants in @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath4 , then our growth estimate implies that @xmath29 application of the beale - kato - majda non - blow - up criterion @xcite would exclude blow - up at @xmath17 since @xmath30 implies @xmath31 .    of particular interest",
    "is the case when the vorticity has a local clebsch representation . in this case",
    ", the vorticity can be represented by the two clebsch variables @xmath32 and @xmath33 near the support of maximum vorticity as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are carried by the flow , that is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the velocity field .",
    "in addition to the geometric regularity assumption on @xmath3 , if we further assume that one of the clebsch variables has a bounded gradient and @xmath37 , then we prove that the maximum vorticity can not grow faster than double exponential in time , i.e. @xmath38 .    as an application of this result , we re -",

    "1 ) , the vorticity field seems to have a local clebsch representation .",
    "one of the clebsch variables may be chosen along the vortex tube direction , which appears to be regular . moreover",
    ", the vortex lines within the support of maximum vorticity seem to be quite smooth and has length of order one , implying that @xmath4 has a positive lower bound .",
    "thus the result that we described above may apply .",
    "one of the important findings of the hou - li computations is that the maximum vorticity does not grow faster than double exponential in time .",
    "our new estimate on the vorticity growth may offer a theoretical explanation to the mechanism that leads to this dynamic depletion of vortex stretching .    .",
