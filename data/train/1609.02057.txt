    ", in compliance with experimental findings  @xcite , the efficiency of thg at the md resonance is noted to significantly exceed that at the ed resonance .",
    "remarkably , due to a larger mode volume of the magnetic mie mode compared to the electric mode of the same order , the magnetic dipole resonance also superiorly enhances raman scattering by individual silicon nanospheres  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the approaches for manipulating and directing the resonantly enhanced nonlinear emission by changing shapes and combining dielectic nanoparticles in oligomers are demonstrated .",
    "this concept is illustrated with an example of a nanoparticle trimer composed of a symmetric dimer of identical silicon spheres placed nearby a smaller nanoparticle .",
    "interparticle interaction influences the multipolar content of the field scattered by a trimer , and the resultant constructive interference between the excited multipoles may provide high directivity of both the linear and nonlinear scattering simultaneously .",

    "_ ultrafast switching .",
    "_ silicon nanoparticles employed as nonlinear mie - type cavities furthermore offer a platform for engineering compact and very speedy photonic switchers . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors distinguish three basic classes of nonlinear phenomena responsible for the optical self - action effect in silicon : ( i ) kerr - type processes , including nonlinear refraction and two - photon absorption ( tpa ) , ( ii ) free carriers ( fc ) generation , and ( iii ) thermo - optical effect .",
    "they were able to design a metasurface of amorphous silicon nanodisks , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](d ) , where the undesirable free - carrier effects , which are generally slow and pose serious restrictions on the speed of signal conversion , are suppressed , leaving the dominant fast tpa contribution in the nonlinear response .",
    "this silicon - based metasurface allowed achieving strong self - modulation of femtosecond pulses with a depth of 60@xmath75 at picojoule - per - nanodisk pump energies .",
    "pump - probe measurements demonstrated that switching in the nanodisks can be governed by pulse - limited 65 fs - long two - photon absorption being enhanced by a factor of 80 with respect to the unstructured silicon film .",
    "this result represents an important step towards novel and efficient active photonic devices , such as transistors and logic elements to be built in integrated circuits  @xcite .",
    "such switching speeds potentially allow for creating data transmission and processing devices operating at tens and hundreds terabits per second .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , kerr and tpa effect - based transmission modulation was reported for a fano - resonant metasurface in ref .",
    "nonlinear light manipulation by scattering diagram and spectra of individual silicon nanoparticles also envisions interesting possibilities for all - optical routing . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was demonstrated , both theoretically and experimentally , that ultrafast transient modulation of the dielectric permittivity due to variation of free - carrier ( electron - hole plasma ) density in silicon , induced via its photoexcitation by fs laser irradiation , significantly alters scattering behavior of a silicon nanoparticle , supporting a magnetic dipole resonance .",
    "later , accelerated reconfiguration of a radiation pattern from dipole - like to unidirectional ( huygens - source scattering ) regime mediated by ultrafast ( with times scales of about 2.5 ps ) generation of electron - hole plasma during laser pulse - nanoantenna interaction was described in ref .",

    "_ second - harmonic generation .",
    "_ for efficient second - order nonlinear applications , advantageous can be excitation of low - order mie modes in nanoantennas made of high - permittivity noncentrosymmetric semiconductors .",
    "while in plasmonic nanoparticles the second - order nonlinear response is dominated by surface nonlinearities enhanced by plasmon resonances , in high - index dielectic nanostructures the bulk nonlinearity may dominate the optical nonlinear interaction in volume , giving rise to better conversion efficiency . in ref .",
    "@xcite the disk - shaped nanoantenna made of aluminum gallium arsenide ( algaas ) is designed for shg at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the authors consider this choice of material favorable because algaas possesses a large volume quadratic susceptibility and parasitic tpa effects can be avoided at wavelengths close to 1.55 @xmath76 m by engineering the al molar fraction in the alloy composition . the second - order bulk nonlinear susceptibility tensor of algaas , possessing a zinc blende crystalline structure , is anisotropic and contains only off - diagonal elements @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "thus , in the principal - axis system of the crystal , the @xmath79th component of the nonlinear source polarization at sh frequency is given by @xmath80 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows that the maximum shg efficiency is achieved for a pump wavelength of 1675 nm , which is close to the magnetic dipole resonance wavelength , and predicted to reach values as high as @xmath81 at 1 gw / cm@xmath56 .",
    "the conversion efficiency strongly depends on the overlap between the induced nonlinear source and modes generated at sh frequency , and its peak appears slightly shifted from the resonance seen in the linear scattering .",
    "the sh nonlinear current distribution resembles an electric quadrupole in this case , and pronounced quadrupolar lobes can be recognized in the multilobe sh far - field radiation pattern  @xcite . in the recent experiment ,",
    "sh conversion efficiency exceeding @xmath83 has been measured for algaas nanocylinders with an optimized geometry pumped at the wavelength of 1.55 @xmath76 m  @xcite .",
    "@xcite further theoretically discusses shaping sh radiation profile of algaas cylindrical nanoantennas through the engineered multipolar interference by manipulating the pump beam ( polarization state , incidence angle , spatial structure ) and by changing the disk geometry .",
    "in particular , whereas no sh emission can be generated by the algaas nanodisk in the normal forward or backward direction under normal excitation because of the structural symmetry and properties of the algaas nonlinear susceptibility , using a pump beam at tilted incidence is beneficial for obtaining sh signal in the normal directions and increasing the detectable sh power that can be measured through a finite numerical aperture microscope objective .",

    "insets show profiles of the electric field amplitude in a e - plane cross - section cut through the center of the cylinder , which correspond to the maxima of two dependencies dominated by md and eq modes , respectively . adopted from refs .  @xcite . ]",
    "we have discussed multipolar nonlinear effects in resonant metallic , metal - dielectric , and all - dielectric photonic structures .",
    "the studies of nonlinear phenomena accompanying the propagation and scattering of light in nanostructured media have been stimulated by a rapid progress in nanofabrication techniques , such as electron beam lithography and wet chemical growth , and a growing interest in photonic metamaterials with optically - induced magnetic response .",
    "the approach based on the multipolar expansion of the electromagnetic fields is closely associated with the mie scattering theory , and it provides an unified description and useful insights into the physics underlying the nonlinear processes with resonantly driven nanoparticles and nanoparticle clusters .",
    "the realization of submicron structures of simple geometries exhibiting intense nonlinear response is eminently promising for the optics - based data manipulation and storage technology , sensing applications , and topological photonics .",
    "while the extensive theoretical and experimental studies of nonlinear optical properties of metallic nanoparticles laid the foundation of contemporary nonlinear nanoplasmonics , in many cases appealing to the electric dipole resonances , all - dielectric systems have recently been demonstrated to offer stronger nonlinear effects and novel functionalities enabled by pronounced magnetic dipole and higher - order mie - type resonances .",
    "the coexistence of strong electric and magnetic resonances and their interference in high - index dielectric and semiconductor nanostructures bring new physics to simple geometries , opening unique prospects for constructing optical nanoantennas and metasurfaces with reduced dissipative losses and considerable enhancement of the nonlinearly generated fields .",
    "these recent developments suggest intriguing opportunities for a design of nonlinear subwavelength light sources with reconfigurable radiation characteristics and engineering large effective optical nonlinearities at the nanoscale , which could have important implications for novel nonlinear photonic metadevices operating beyond the diffraction limit .",

    "<S> nonlinear nanophotonics is a rapidly developing field with many useful applications for a design of nonlinear nanoantennas , light sources , nanolasers , sensors , and ultrafast miniature metadevices </S>",
    "<S> . a tight confinement of the local electromagnetic fields in resonant photonic nanostructures can boost nonlinear optical effects , thus offering versatile opportunities for subwavelength control of light . to achieve the desired functionalities , it is essential to gain flexible control over the near- and far - field properties of nanostructures . thus , both modal and multipolar analyses are widely exploited for engineering nonlinear scattering from resonant nanoscale elements , in particular for enhancing the near - field interaction , tailoring the far - field multipolar interference , and optimization of the radiation directionality . here , we review the recent advances in this recently emerged research field ranging from metallic structures exhibiting localized plasmonic resonances to hybrid metal - dielectric and all - dielectric nanostructures driven by mie - type multipolar resonances and optically - induced magnetic response . </S>"
