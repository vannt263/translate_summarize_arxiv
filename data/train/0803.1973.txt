    "on the one hand a state representing the system in its excited state with no boson and on the other hand a continuum representing the system in its fundamental state together with one boson whose state is assumed to depend only on a scalar parameter .",
    "the set of resonances which do not come from the energy levels of the decoupled system , resonances which we called elsewhere nonstandard ( or of @xmath1-type ) depends on the singularities at a finite or infinite distance of the coupling function given by the hamiltonian matrix elements between the above mentioned two kinds of states .",
    "these singularities are not mathematical curiosities ; they necessarily exist and in certain cases have a clear physical meaning .",
    "the coupling function depends on the wave functions of the two considered levels and its singularities depend on the space extent of these wave functions .",
    "if the system is a particle in a potential , these singularities depend on the chosen potential .",
    "it is interesting to study the set of resonances for different potentials . after having studied the square - well case ( ref .",
    "3 ) we now treat the coulombian and harmonic potentials when the coupling to the field is strong .",
    "our concern is to store up results on the position of in different contexts in order to understand them better .",
    "a particular aspect we focus on is the relation between the width of these resonances and the space extent of the wave functions associated with the two quantum levels of the system .",
    "we are also particularly motivated by the following question .",
    "let us consider a particle @xmath2 bound to its antiparticle @xmath3 , this system interacting strongly with the field of a massless boson .",
    "when the field interacts with sufficiently excited @xmath2@xmath3 states , that is to say with particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 sufficiently apart , can new particles be created , as hybrid states , of zero or very small width . and does this possibility increase with the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in one of the levels of the pair ?",
    "the calculation of the resonances in the coulomb potential case was already tackled in ref .",
    "4 with the electromagnetic coupling as the coupling to the field . in sec .",
    "2 we now treat a strong coupling , and larger masses .",
    "it makes the pertinent , whereas their widths were extremely large for the electron and its coupling to the transverse photon .",
    "we calculate a certain number of them for a certain value of the coupling constant .",
    "the harmonic potential case was tackled in ref . 5 with the same electromagnetic coupling .",
    "we are now also going to treat a strong coupling case , showing in sec .",
    "3 resonances we did not take into account in ref .",
    "both sections end with a concluding subsection which sums up the main results qualitatively .",
    "a synthesis is made in section 4 .",
    "apart from the discussion of the above mentioned question , studies for these two potentials are also a preparation for studying a realistic quark - antiquark potential later , a potential for which computations are more difficult . a first calculation of a nonstandard resonance for such a potential is presented in ref .",
    "such a future study should take more than two levels into account .",
    "let us reduce the above - mentioned two - particle system to a mass @xmath5 particle attracted by the origin with the strength @xmath6 .",
    "besides , this particle is coupled to a transverse massless vector field @xmath7 through the hamiltonian @xmath8 when the particle is the electron , the force is the attraction that a proton placed at the origin exerts on it and @xmath9 is the coupling to the transverse electromagnetic field . ( the factor @xmath10 , containing the vacuum permittivity , usually present in @xmath11 has been suppressed and transfered into the factor in front of @xmath12 . ) in the present study we are going to consider an interaction in which @xmath13 is no longer @xmath14 but is of the order of @xmath15 . besides , the particle is no longer light like the electron but has a mass of the order of the light quarks one .",
    "we are going to show into which resonances the unperturbed levels of the particle in the potential are transformed when the coupling constant changes from @xmath16 to @xmath15 ( sec .",
    "but our main concern is to calculate other resonances that the coupling to the field yields .",
    "let us consider the energy levels of the particle in the @xmath4 potential , levels which are made instable by the interaction @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested either in the transition from a state @xmath17 ( _ h _ for high ) , with principal quantum number @xmath18 and energy @xmath19 , toward a state @xmath20 ( _ l _ for low ) , with principal quantum number @xmath21 and energy @xmath22 , this transition being accompanied with the emission of a boson of the field , or in the inverse transition and the absorption of the boson .",
    "we assume the quantum numbers of the boson are @xmath23 and its helicity is @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the orbital momentum of state @xmath20 is @xmath25 , this entailing taking @xmath26 . wanting to reduce the problem to a two - level problem , since this is the only one we know how to treat , we forget all levels except the two we mentioned",
    ". then the states of the particle - field system are in the space spanned by @xmath17 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is in @xmath29 .",
    "the hamiltonian acting in this space is @xmath30 with @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see ref . 7 . )",
    "the @xmath34 s are functions of @xmath35 .",
    "we set @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; then @xmath39    set @xmath40 .",
    "the energy @xmath41 of the resonances is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a zero of the analytic continuation into the second sheet of the function @xmath44 setting @xmath45 , and using @xmath46 , we can write @xmath47 as @xmath48 the analytic continuation @xmath49 of this function into the lower half - plane , across @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 the key point in our study , a point our preceding works were focused on , is that the singularities of @xmath52 are the cause of the existence of resonances which do not tend to @xmath19 , the energy of the excited state , when the coupling tends to @xmath16 .",
    "they are the nonstandard resonances .",
    "we get here the precise meaning of the expression `` do not come from '' used as a shortening in the first paragraph of the introduction .",
    "the pole of @xmath52 entails a pole in @xmath43 of the integral and hence of @xmath49 , and , when @xmath13 is small , the zeros of @xmath49 , corresponding to the nonstandard resonances , are close to this pole of the integral .      for the system we consider here , we showed ( ref .",
    "4 ) that the singularities of @xmath52 in the lower half - plane reduce to one pole . ( it must be noted , however , that its multiplicity varies with the pair of levels which is considered . )    the imaginary part of this pole is related to the space extension of states @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "more precisely , the two wave functions of @xmath17 and @xmath20 decreasing at infinity like @xmath53 , @xmath54 , let @xmath55 denote half the harmonic mean of distances @xmath56 and @xmath57 , in units of @xmath58 , @xmath59 times the particle s compton wave - length .",
    "the imaginary part of the pole is then @xmath60 ( see ref .",
    "we have @xmath61 .",
    "the more extended the pair , hence the more excited its states , the closer to the real axis the    pole of @xmath52 ( see table 1 ) , and therefore the closer to the real axis the resonances if @xmath13 is small .",
    "( the nevertheless remain far from the reals for the atom in the electromagnetic field ; see below . )",
    "if @xmath13 is not small , for instance if it is of the order of @xmath15 , a precise study must be carried ; this is the aim of this sec .",
    "2 .    denoted by @xmath62 in @xmath63 units ,",
    "the energies corresponding to these poles in @xmath43 are -0.2 cm @xmath64 -0.2 cm for pair @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we approximately recover the width of the we calculated in ref . 4 in the electron case . indeed , we have : @xmath67 kev @xmath68 kev , the width of the being @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 kev .",
    "the width of level @xmath72 is approximately @xmath73 ev ( if one considers one helicity only ) , which makes a factor of @xmath74 between the two widths .",
    "in contrast , for a mass of @xmath75 mev , @xmath76 , and pair ( 2,1 ) , the absolute value of the imaginary part of the pole of the resolvent s matrix element is @xmath77 mev@xmath78 mev , a value much more interesting than that of the electromagnetic case .      for information only , let us give some coupling functions ( the referred pair is indicated in the subscript ) : @xmath80 fig .",
    "1 gives the result of the numerical computation of the for the first six pairs of levels .",
    "they are shown by bold points in the complex energy plane .",
    "the energy unit on the axes is @xmath63 .",
    "the level energies in this unit are given in table 2 .",
    "the real part of @xmath62 gives the energy of the lowest level of the pair .",
    "the absolute value of the resonances imaginary parts are to be interpreted as usual as their widths .",
    "0.7 cm    the number of resonances increases with the excitation of the pair ( because the order of the pole of @xmath52 , and therefore the order of that of @xmath49 , increases ) and their energies are disposed around the value @xmath62 , represented by a finer point in the figure .",
    "resonances being all the more interesting when their width is small , we are going firstly to focus on these widths and particularly on their dependence on the space extent of the states , through @xmath81 .      when the extent of the pair increases , the fact that the pole of @xmath52 comes closer to the reals manifests itself in @xmath62 coming closer to the reals .",
    "some resonances have a width greater , others a width smaller than @xmath81 .",
    "we leave the problem of the physical meaning of each resonance aside and we focus on the resonance with the smallest width . its value together with @xmath55 , the mean extent of the pair , is given in table 2 .",
    "@xmath82 represents the strength of the coupling , in @xmath83 units , i.e. @xmath84 .    the width for pairs ( 2,1 ) , ( 3,1 ) , ( 4,1 ) is about @xmath85 mev ; it falls down to @xmath86 mev for pairs ( 3,2 ) and ( 4,2 ) which have a greater space extent and to @xmath87 mev for pair ( 4,3 ) the space extent of which is still greater . but one has to take into account the fact that the level spacing decreases so that the ratio of the widths to this level spacing in fact increases : widths are greater than @xmath83 by a factor of 2 or 3 for pairs based on level 1 , a factor of 5 or 7 for those based on level 2 and a factor of 10 for level 3 .",
    "this limits the physical meaning that can be given to these states , for the considered @xmath13 value .",
    "let us consider pairs @xmath88 and examine whether narrow resonances could be obtained through making @xmath89 large .",
    "the extent @xmath55 is @xmath90 and its upper limit is @xmath15 if @xmath89 goes to infinity .",
    "the pole of @xmath52 approaches the reals up to the limit value @xmath91 , corresponding to @xmath92 .",
    "the ratio @xmath93 is @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , the answer is no . for the series @xmath94 , the limit of @xmath55 is @xmath72 and the pole of @xmath52 approaches the reals up to @xmath95 , which corresponds to @xmath96 .",
    "the width does decrease when we change from @xmath88 to @xmath97 , but the ratio to the level spacing increases : it is now @xmath98 . we see that we never get small ratios . therefore , as regards the question mentioned in the introduction about the creation of narrow states for large @xmath89 , we see that the @xmath4 potential does not provide an interesting setting .",
    "when both principal quantum numbers increase , @xmath62 approaches the reals .",
    "the calculation gets more and more difficult , if only because of the increasing number of resonances .",
    "however we can get an idea of the displacement of the cluster in the case where @xmath99 becomes large and @xmath100 .",
    "we saw that @xmath101 . for @xmath100 and large @xmath99",
    ", we have @xmath102 for large @xmath99 , @xmath103 may become quite small .",
    "for instance , with @xmath79 mev , and @xmath104 , @xmath105 mev and for @xmath106 , @xmath107 mev .",
    "therefore , we can expect narrow resonances .",
    "but the difference between the energies of the two considered levels also becomes small , decreasing as @xmath108 . as a consequence the ratio of the width to the level spacing increases like @xmath109 .",
    "hence the resonances will not be seen for large @xmath99 , in our two - level approximation .",
    "nevertheless , for larger @xmath13 values , the resonances width may be small , as fig .",
    "2 shows it .",
    "for pair ( 2,1 ) , the figure shows the energy and width ( vertical line ) of the narrowest nonstandard resonance for different @xmath13 values .",
    "( the unperturbed levels are drawn in bold lines . )",
    "since the `` ionization energy '' increases like @xmath110 ( the potential is proportional to @xmath13 ) and @xmath103 behaves like @xmath13 , we already expect the ratio of the widths to the level spacing to decrease when @xmath13 increases .",
    "but the diagram shows that the width itself decreases . besides , the resonance s energy approaches the lowest level of the pair .",
    "the resonance even becomes real negative , that is to say an eigenvalue of the hamiltonian , if @xmath111 .    in order to see what role actually play in strong interactions",
    ", it is thus important to know what coupling constant should be used .",
    "it is also necessary of course to know what potential is the most appropriate . in this respect ,",
    "let us mention the result of a calculation for the two lowest levels in a model where two @xmath75 mev masses attract each over through a potential of the form @xmath112 , this system being coupled to the field of a massless vector boson , with a coupling constant @xmath113 : we find a nonstandard resonance of @xmath114 mev , whose width is only @xmath115 times the energy difference between the two uncoupled states at @xmath116 mev and @xmath117 mev .",
    "( there is an error in ref .",
    "3 due to an extra factor of 2 in the coupling @xmath118 . )",
    "hence there are physically reasonable potential for which the are more interesting than those obtained with the @xmath4 potential and @xmath76 .",
    "we are going to see what happens in the harmonic oscillator case in sec .",
    "3 .    for pair @xmath65",
    ", we noted that , if the coupling is strong enough , the width decreases when the coupling increases , becoming even @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath81 also decreases at fixed @xmath13 , for pairs @xmath88 , if @xmath89 increases .",
    "hence one could look for narrow widths for large @xmath89 and large @xmath13 , the latter not too large to keep a physical meaning .",
    "for example : do we find narrow resonances for pairs @xmath88 with a coupling @xmath119 or @xmath120 ?",
    "the computation shows that the answer is no : for pair @xmath121 , the width increases with @xmath13 for @xmath122 ( whereas it decreased for pair @xmath65 for @xmath123 ) .",
    "the width starts decreasing only for greater values of @xmath13 .",
    "it vanishes for @xmath124 .",
    "we recall that the critical value for pair @xmath65 was @xmath125 .",
    "the space extent of the levels does not provide easily measurable although their width are much smaller with respect to the level spacing than for the electron and the electromagnetic coupling .    up to now",
    "we have been interested in the widths of the nonstandard resonances , widths which are closely related to the poles of @xmath52 .",
    "let us now focus on how the resonances energy vary when the particle moves away from the origin .      for pairs ( 2,1 ) ,",
    "( 3,1 ) and ( 4,1 ) on the one hand and for pairs ( 3,2 ) and ( 4,2 ) on the other hand , table 2 shows a lowering of the energy of the narrowest resonance down toward the lowest energy of the pair , whereas the widths are almost constant in the two series . thus making the distance of the particle from the attraction center ( or the distance between two particles ) larger when considering",
    "successively states 2,3 and 4 or states 3 and 4 lowers the energy of one of the associated with the transition from the fundamental state to these states .",
    "this property is noticeable , although it would be more interesting if the resonances were narrower .",
    "but we will see this property is also true for the system studied in sec .",
    "3 . in the following section",
    "we show that the property holds for @xmath126 , whereas the situation is more complicated for @xmath119 .      for @xmath119 , which gives @xmath127 , and still for the narrowest resonance , the gap to the fundamental does not decrease but increases when we shift from pair @xmath65 to pair @xmath121 : it goes from @xmath128 to @xmath129 ( the width also increases , going from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , whereas the two widths were almost equal for @xmath76 ) .",
    "but for pair @xmath121 , there is a resonance with a lower energy and a width only slightly greater than the one we just considered : this resonance is circled in fig . 3 which gives all the for pair ( 3,1 ) , in the complex energy plane and in @xmath63 units .",
    "this resonance is @xmath132 above @xmath133 , this time closer to @xmath133 than the narrowest resonance for pair ( 2,1 ) .",
    "we would then recover the lowering .",
    "however we see that the great number of complicates the qualitative analysis of the influence of the particle s position on the energy of the resonances . for pair ( 4,1 ) , and still for @xmath119 , there is a resonance with about the same energy as the one we just mentioned ( and also the same width @xmath134 ) .    on the contrary ,",
    "the phenomenon we saw for @xmath76 repeats itself for @xmath126 , since the gap between the narrowest resonance and the fundamental decreases , going from @xmath135 to @xmath136 when we change from pair ( 2,1 ) to pair ( 3,1 ) .",
    "( the width also decreases , going from @xmath137 to @xmath138 , the level spacing being @xmath139 for ( 2,1 ) . )    in any case , for the three values of @xmath13 we considered , the interest of the resonances seems limited by their large widths .",
    "the perturbed levels energies are close to the unperturbed ones and we do not give them here .",
    "as regards the width @xmath140 ( _ s _ for standard ) that the upper level of the pair acquire through the coupling to the field , its ratio to @xmath83 is given in table 3 .",
    "for pair ( 2,1 ) , @xmath76 and @xmath79 mev , the energies of the two levels being @xmath141 mev and @xmath142 mev , the energy of the narrowest nonstandard resonance is @xmath143 mev .",
    "the width is large but not very large .",
    "increasing the coupling sufficiently allows to reduce the width of nonstandard resonances , but we need quite strong couplings to change these resonances into stable states . for example @xmath144 for pair ( 2,1 ) , and @xmath145 for pair ( 3,1 ) .",
    "going from level 2 to levels 3 and 4 , therefore increasing the distance between the particle and the attraction centerer , lowers the energy of the narrowest nonstandard resonance toward level 1 , for @xmath76 or @xmath126 .",
    "however , its width is not small .    considering pairs of very excited levels yield whose widths are small , for example @xmath146 mev , but large compared to the level spacing , a spacing that decreases as the excitation increases .",
    "we are now going to consider a system for which the excitation of the levels does not go together with their narrowing . in this case",
    ", the influence of the space extent of the uncoupled states on the energy and width of the will be more perceptible .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath5 and frequency @xmath147 . les us assume it is coupled to the field of a massless scalar boson whose states are described in @xmath148 . we assume the only non - zero matrix elements of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath9 are @xmath149 where @xmath150 .",

    "note that we do not set ourselves here in the frame of the wigner - weisskopf model ( see for instance ref . 8 , or ref .",
    "the latter excludes transitions between states the quantum numbers of which differ by more than one and it only involves one coupling function @xmath156 .",

    "4 , this width is only a fraction of the gap between the two levels . for pair @xmath229 ,",
    "the width of the resonance with the lowest energy above @xmath206 is @xmath230 mev , but it is seven times less than the energy difference between the two levels ( @xmath231 mev ) .",
    "later on , we are going to see that the same lowering phenomenon occurs for pairs @xmath189 but this time with narrow widths .",
    "let us note here incidentally that there is a resonance with a small width of @xmath232 mev for pair @xmath121 .",
    "( we give these figures just to point out the possible importance of some nonstandard resonances in a concrete way ; we of course do not claim here , nor elsewhere in this paper , to any precise realistic description of strong interactions . )",
    "it has to be noted that resonances with energies greater than @xmath216 s may also have small widths : for instance , for pair @xmath233 , @xmath234 mev .    for the family @xmath189 , let us consider the lowest energy resonance once we have put the already mentioned eigenvalue aside .",
    "its energy lowers toward @xmath235 when @xmath89 increases . indeed , for pair ( 2,1 )",
    ", the energy is @xmath236 mev , @xmath237 mev above @xmath238 , and the width is @xmath239 mev ; for @xmath240 , the energy is @xmath241 mev , that is to say @xmath242 mev above @xmath133 , and the width is @xmath243 mev ; for @xmath244 , the energy is @xmath245 mev , @xmath246 mev above @xmath247 , and the width is @xmath248 mev .",
    "we see the widths are small , which gives the energy of these resonances more meaning .",
    "the result can be expressed through saying that the gap to the lower level is a decreasing function of the above defined pair s mean extent , for @xmath249 .",
    "table 4 gives this gap in mev as a function of @xmath250 ( in fermi ) , for various @xmath89 s .      as the standard resonance is concerned , widths are of the order of a few mev for pairs @xmath189 , @xmath89 varying from @xmath15 to @xmath251 , or for pair @xmath121 .",
    "we thus note the widths of the are comparable , for these pairs , to those of the above mentioned nonstandard resonances .",
    "the widths of the become smaller and sometimes very small for pairs @xmath252 , or @xmath253 .",
    "contrary to what might be expected ,",
    "the reason why the widths are so small is not that the strength of the coupling gets small : for example we have @xmath254 , whereas the width is of the order of @xmath255 .",
    "the smallness rather holds to the way the resonance depends on @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , for pair ( 4,0 ) , when @xmath13 increases starting from @xmath16 , the resonance follows the curve shown in fig . 6 in the complex plane of variable @xmath43 .",
    "we thus see that increasing the coupling strength does not increase the resonance s width , but on the contrary diminishes it .",
    "we already met this phenomenon in such a two - level problem , when the coupling function is such that the standard resonance becomes a negative eigenvalue as the coupling increases ( ref . 10 ) .",
    "of course , in some situations , the resonance s width may also increase with the coupling ( fig .",
    "it all depends on the coupling function of the problem that is considered ( its shape , its width and the coupling strength ) .      in summary",
    ", we showed various types of quite narrow resonances ( widths between @xmath16 and @xmath256 mev ) , apart from the standard resonance which is always narrow in the case we considered : resonances @xmath187 for pairs @xmath189 ( zero width ) and pairs @xmath257 one the one hand ; resonances @xmath216 for pairs @xmath258 on the other hand .",
    "for other pairs for which the widths are larger , these widths may still be small in comparison with the energy difference between the two levels .    when the space extent of the pair increases , we see for each of the families : @xmath189 , @xmath226 , @xmath221 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , that resonance @xmath216 comes nearer to the lower level of the pair when @xmath89 increases .",
    "for all the series but the first one , if @xmath89 increases , the transition to the upper level is a transition from a fixed state to a state where the particle sits farther from its attraction center . for resonance @xmath187 , except for the series @xmath189 , the lowering also occurs but is only relative .",
    "for the two systems we have been considering , the interest of taking account of has been confirmed , as regards both characteristics of these resonances .",
    "firstly their widths .",
    "we showed cases where they are small or vanish . secondly their energies , which have a greater physical meaning when the width is small , absolutely or relatively to the gap between the two levels .",
    "we found energies comparable to those of the considered levels . for example , they may be below the lower level or between the two levels . when the resonances are narrow ( respectively of zero width ) , one might say that the building of such a resonance ( resp . a mixed mater - field state ) by the field is in competition with the excitation of the particle up to the upper level .    we get a partial answer to the question raised in the introduction about states appearing when the particles bound by certain potentials move apart from each other .",
    "we have seen how the excitation of the levels influence the energies of the together with their widths .",
    "such a relation had already been noticed in the case of the square - well potential studied in ref .",
    "3 . here , in several cases we noted that the larger the space extent of the pair , the smaller the gap between the energy of one of the and the lower level of the pair .",
    "this space extension may be realized through the excitation of the only upper level or through the excitation of both levels .",
    "the former case corresponds to the particle moving away from the origin .",
    "this moving away is thus accompanied by the presence of a more and more bound ( unstable ) `` state '' . in the harmonic oscillator case ,",
    "the smallness of the resonances widths makes the phenomenon particularly interesting . for the @xmath4 potential , the connection between the extent of the pair and the lowering of the resonances energy that we saw for the first values of @xmath89 is less interesting because of the resonances width .",
    "the two examples differ in that , when the excitation degree increases , the spacing of two consecutive levels diminishes in one case and is constant in the other case .",
    "let us point out an other difference between the two cases , as regards the nonstandard resonances origin seen from a mathematical point of view . for the @xmath4 potential ,",
    "the coupling functions are bounded at infinity but they have a pole in the lower half - plane .",
    "it is toward this pole that the tend when @xmath13 goes to @xmath16 . for the harmonic oscillator",
    ", the coupling functions do not have any finite distance pole but are not bounded at infinity .",
    "the then tend to infinity when the coupling to the field tends to @xmath16 .",
    "the fact that there is several for each pair is due in both cases to the fact that the singularity of the coupling function is not simple .",
    "this study completes our preceding works on the interaction of a system with a massless boson field .",
    "we now have calculations of in several cases : a particle in a square - well coupled to the boson ( ref .",
    "3 ) ; a two - level atom coupled to the electromagnetic field in a cavity with various quality factors , the coupling being modeled by a lorentzian function ( ref .",
    "4 ) ; a particle in a @xmath4 potential weakly or strongly coupled to the boson ( ref . 4 and the present study ) ;",
    "a harmonic oscillator weakly or strongly coupled to the boson ( ref . 5 and the present study ) ;",
    "a particle in a @xmath261 potential strongly coupled to the boson ( ref .",
    "we note that singularities of the coupling function at infinity play a role in both the square - well and the harmonic oscillator cases ; therefore they are not to be neglected .",
    "we have not studied them in the @xmath261-case .    in all the cases we studied ,",
    "the calculations of the resonances required that we considered only two levels . in order to go beyond the qualitative results that this assumption has provided and to get quantitative predictions for a realistic quark - antiquark potential",
    ", it would be interesting to know how to tackle a three - level problem .",
    "this problem seems to be complicated , if only because of the involved multivalued analytic structure of the functions coming into play .",
    "we would like to know what becomes of the resonances we have constructed through artificially selecting two levels ; the change in the structure of the set of resonances is likely to be important .",
    "our simplification has provided some ideas to be tested in more elaborate models .    in the introduction , we mentioned possible calculations with the @xmath261 potential which contains a confining term .",
    "another line of research might be to consider a potential without any confining force , such as the yukawa potential , and determine whether there exist resonances of lower and lower energies analogous to the ones we saw in this paper and whether this could be related to a confinement mechanism ."
