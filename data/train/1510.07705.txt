    "the yukawa one - component - plasma ( ocp ) model , in which particles interact through a screened , repulsive @xmath3 potential ( eq .  [ yukawainteraction ] ) , is used to describe systems such as the cores of white dwarf stars @xcite and jovian planets @xcite , plasmas produced during inertial confinement fusion @xcite , dusty plasmas consisting of highly charged dust particles @xcite , charge - stabilized colloidal systems such as latex spheres in a polar solvent @xcite , and ions in ultracold neutral plasmas ( unps ) @xcite , which are the focus of this work .",
    "such systems contain one species of interest ( e.g. ions ) and at least one other species ( e.g. electrons , polar molecules ) that acts to screen interactions between particles of the species of interest .",
    "in addition to describing many real systems , this model is also used in molecular dynamics studies of strongly coupled plasmas @xcite , and for research on phase transitions @xcite .",
    "interactions in the yukawa model take the form :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a measure of the interaction strength , and @xmath7 is known as the debye screening length .",

    "this universal scaling follows from the classical scaling invariance for a system of charged particles , and it allows for comparisons to be made between systems with different @xmath10 , @xmath6 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the temperature .    in this paper , we demonstrate universal scaling in the ion component of unps created by photoionizing a laser cooled ( @xmath1mk ) magneto - optically trapped gas @xcite .",

    "this leads to the normalized units chosen here of energy @xmath14 , position @xmath15 , and time @xmath16 , where the time scaling factor is the ion plasma oscillation frequency @xmath17 .",
    "universal scaling is demonstrated by measuring the evolution of the ion kinetic energy after photoionization , which can be thought of as a rapid quench from @xmath2 ( i.e. the non - interacting gas ) to @xmath18 , where @xmath18 is an experimentally adjustable parameter ( see sec .  [ unps ] ) .",
    "we verify that , in appropriately scaled units , the post - quench kinetic energy evolution in plasmas with the same value of @xmath18 are identical even if the density is varied over a factor of 30 ( @xmath19m@xmath20 ) and the electron temperature is varied over an order of magnitude ( @xmath21k ) .",

    "the scaling of the dynamics of three - body recombination in an ultracold neutral plasma was investigated with molecular dynamics simulations in  @xcite .",
    "one interesting feature of the quench of an infinitely screened yukawa ocp is that it automatically results in a strongly coupled plasma ( scp ) @xcite .",
    "coupling is parameterized by the ratio of the nearest neighbor coulomb interaction energy to the kinetic energy    @xmath22    where the ratio @xmath23 is the coulomb coupling parameter for species @xmath24 at temperature @xmath25 . for strong coupling , @xmath26 .",

    "fluorescence is excited in a 1 mm thick sheet passing through the center of the plasma .",
    "this ensures that fluorescence is excited in a region with little density variation along the unresolvable imaging axis ( for our smallest width , @xmath91 mm , density varies by @xmath92 along the image axis ) .",
    "we define our coordinate system such that the lif laser lies in the x - y plane , propagating along the x - axis , at approximately z=0 .",
    "a fraction of the fluorescence emitted perpendicular to the sheet is then collected and imaged via a 1:1 optical relay onto an intensified charge coupled device ( iccd ) with a 13@xmath52 m pixel size .",

    "[ mdsim ] , the assumption of a thermalized plasma is not strictly valid during dih ; the velocity distribution can differ slightly from a gaussian , especially during the initial rise in kinetic energy .",

    "another source of complication is that @xmath104 will vary with density throughout the plasma during the dih process , as both the frequency of the keos and the overall energy scaling are both density dependent .",
    "thus , we restrict our analysis to a region of area @xmath109mm@xmath110 mm ( 80@xmath11180 pixels ) centered on the center of the plasma as a compromise between the desire to maximize signal and the desire to keep the density relatively uniform over the analysis region .",
    "it is important to note that the plasma is unconfined , and that after it is created the electron thermal pressure causes it to expand radially .",

    "[ fig : nfitvncam ] ) and the fitted electron temperatures are too low ( fig .  [",
    "fig : tefitvtedial ] ) .",
    "these deviations can , at least in part , be explained by additional dephasing in the dih curve caused by density fluctuations : fluctuations arise from shot - to - shot experimental variation and the inhomogeneous , gaussian density distribution of the plasma .",
    "the measurement effectively averages oscillations of different frequencies due to the dependence of @xmath76 on @xmath10 .",
    "the additional dephasing mimics the damping that would result from increasing the screening parameter @xmath0 , therefore , this dephasing should push @xmath164 down with respect to @xmath166 , as @xmath149 . however , a higher fitted @xmath0 value also would reduce the expected dih for a plasma of density @xmath165 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamvkap ] ) ; @xmath163 is therefore pushed higher than @xmath170 in order to increase the energy scaling parameter @xmath171 enough to compensate for the reduction in dih .",
    "the difference between @xmath163 and @xmath165 has a negligible effect on the fitted @xmath0 relative to the difference between @xmath164 and @xmath166 .",
    "we simulate this effect using our md library as discussed in further detail in the appendix . by fitting the simulated curves in the same way we fit experimental @xmath144 data , we acquired the gold curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : nfitvncam ] and  [ fig : tefitvtedial ] , which largely account for the observed deviation in both @xmath10 and @xmath40 .",
    "these curves correspond to a 20% shot - to - shot variation in density , which agrees with the estimate of shot - to - shot density variation obtained from images of individual plasmas . for both parameters ,",
    "the deviation of the fit value from the actual value varies weakly with @xmath0 .",
    "but , this effect is small compared to the size of the deviation ( @xmath172% in our range ) .",
    "so , we neglect it here , and show a single curve of the fit parameters versus the actual plasma parameters to describe all the @xmath0 values in our range .",
    "this work represents a clear demonstration of the universal scaling of yukawa ocp dynamics with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "we have confirmed that plasma dynamics after a rapid quench from @xmath2 to @xmath157 are universal in @xmath0 over nearly two orders of magnitude in @xmath10 .",
    "this work expands on prior studies of dih in unps @xcite by showing with simulation and experiment that the universal scaling holds over the entire equilibration period , encompassing the initial disorder - induced heating phase , damped kinetic energy oscillations , and the slow approach to equilibrium over several inverse plasma periods .",
    "we have also demonstrated that universal scaling can be used as a tool for measuring the plasma density and , to a lesser degree , the electron temperature .",
    "future work will focus on the excitation and damping of collective modes during equilibration , and the influence of @xmath0 on these phenomena .",

    "here we consider the effect of experimental density variations on our analysis of dih and the keos .",
    "density fluctuations arise in two ways in the experiment .",
    "first , underlying each lif spectrum are images of @xmath173 plasmas , which is necessary for good statistics .",
    "ideally , all of those plasmas would have the same size , density , electron temperature , etc .",
    "however , there is natural shot to shot fluctuation in all of these parameters .",
    "second , plasmas inherit the gaussian spatial distribution of the mot , i.e. , they have non - uniform density . the largest region that is used when measuring @xmath106 is a @xmath174 region in the center of the plasma , selected by the lif laser beam and region of interest on the camera .",
    "the variation in density within this region forms another source of density variation .",
    "the spread in @xmath0 and @xmath171 from density variations is small .",
    "however , since the frequency of the keos depends on density through @xmath76 , averaging curves corresponding to different densities results in apparent increased damping through dephasing . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dephasing ] , we examine the effect of both sources of density fluctuations using the md data .",
    "md dih curve ( blue ) and the curves with regional and/or shot - to - shot density fluctuations taken into account .",
    "the shot - to - shot fluctuations are the larger source of dephasing , becoming significant when the fluctuations are on the 20% level ( green ) ]    for a given peak density @xmath175 and temperature @xmath40 , the regional variation is described by dividing the @xmath174 box into sub - boxes of size @xmath176 , with the density in each sub - box calculated using the measured gaussian density distribution @xmath177 $ ] , where @xmath178 are the sub - box coordinates .",
    "we then unscale md dih data for @xmath179 in each sub - box ( i.e. , in each sub - box we convert the md @xmath180 to @xmath144 with the scaling factors determined by @xmath181 ) .",
    "@xmath144 curves are then averaged together and then rescaled back to @xmath134 using @xmath175 .",
    "the shot - to - shot fluctuations are taken into account by repeating that procedure for a set of 1000 values of @xmath175 taken from a normal distribution with standard deviation of either 10% or 20% .",
    "figure  [ fig : dephasing ] shows the effect of density variation .",
    "the regional variation of density has a small effect on the fit parameters , but the shot - to - shot fluctuations are significant . by fitting this simulated data for @xmath10 and @xmath40 in the same way we fit our real experimental data , we determine that the fitted electron temperature is reduced , as the additional dephasing is indistinguishable from a increase in @xmath0 , and thus a decrease in @xmath40 ( see fig .",
