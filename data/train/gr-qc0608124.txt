    "historically , compton effect is one of the most important evidence of particle nature of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "compton scattering or equivalently compton effect , is the reduction of energy ( or increase of wavelength ) of an x - ray or gamma ray photon , when it interacts with matter .",
    "the amount the wavelength increases by is called the compton shift .",
    "although nuclear compton scattering exists , what is meant by compton scattering usually is the interaction involving only the electrons of an atom .",
    "this effect is important because it demonstrates that light can not be explained purely as a wave phenomenon .",
    "thomson scattering , the classical theory of charged particles scattered by an electromagnetic wave , can not explain any shift in wavelength .",
    "light must behave as if it consists of particles in order to explain the compton scattering .",
    "compton s experiment convinced physicists that light can behave as a stream of particles whose energy are proportional to the frequency[1 ] .",
    "when a high energy photon collides an electron , part of its initial energy will transfer to electron and cause it to recoil .",
    "the other part of initial photon energy leads to creation of a new photon and this photon moves in a direction which satisfy the total momentum conservation .",
    "compton scattering occurs in all materials and predominantly with photons of medium energy , i.e. about 0.5 to 3.5 mev .",
    "+ recently it has been revealed that lorentz symmetry is not an exact symmetry of the nature .",
    "possible violation of lorentz invariance has been studied from several view points [ 2,3,4 ] . from a loop quantum gravity point of view",
    ", a lorentz invariance violation can be formulated in the modification of standard dispersion relation . since formulation of ordinary compton effect",
    "is based on the standard dispersion relation , possible modification of this dispersion relation may affect the calculations and their interpretations . here",
    "we are going to incorporate these quantum gravity effects in the formulation of the compton effect .",
    "although numerical values of these modifications are very small , possible detection of these small effects will support underlying quantum gravity proposal .",
    "we use uhecr data to estimate typical wave length shift due to these quantum gravity effects . in this manner",
    "we constraint threshold momentum to a lower value relative to existing prescriptions . + the paper is organized as follows : section 2 is devoted to a brief review of standard compton effect and its formulation focusing on the central role played by dispersion relation .",
    "section 3 gives an overview of modified dispersion relations .",
    "our calculations are presented in section 4 .",
    "the paper follows by a numerical estimation of the wavelength shift and related discussion .",
    "suppose that a photon with known wavelength collides with a thin metallic surface .",
    "in classical theory of light scattering , photon will be reflected by oscillating electron in such a way that its angular distribution varies as @xmath3 .",
    "compton had been noticed that scattered photons consist of two different wavelength : a part with the same wavelength as original photons .",
    "these photons have been scattered by the whole of the atom .",
    "another part of scattered photons have shifted wavelength relative to incident photons and their wavelength depend on the angular parameter .",

    "a simple calculation leads to the following expression @xmath21 which can be rewritten as follows @xmath22    where @xmath23 is called the compton wavelength .",

    "lorentz invariance violation at quantum gravity level can be addressed by the modification of the standard dispersion relations . recently these modified dispersion relations have been used to describe anomalies in astrophysical phenomena such as the gzk cutoff anomaly[5,6 ] as well as a large number of problems in the spirit of quantum mechanics(see for instance [ 5 ] and references therein ) .",
    "modified dispersion relations have support on several alternative approaches to quantum gravity problem[7,8 ] .",

    "if we look at equation ( 25 ) and demand that both photon frequencies be positive , then we learn that @xmath63 should be negative and one of the polarizations is ruled out .",

    "+ now we consider the more general case where photon dispersion relation is modified by quantum gravity effect also . for photons",
    ", the modified dispersion relation can be written as [ 11 ] @xmath75\\ ] ] where @xmath76 in this relation , @xmath77 and @xmath32 are the respective energy and momentum of the photon , while @xmath78 and @xmath79 are adimensionl parameters of order one , and @xmath80 is a free parameter that still needs interpretation parameter in the fermion dispersion relation was not considered in some literature such as [ 12 ] ] .",

    "when gamma ray burst ( grb ) data are analyzed to restrict @xmath82 [ 14 ] , the following condition arises @xmath83 for photon s dispersion relation which we have considered , ( 32 ) can be interpreted as the bound @xmath84 . to consider photon(boson ) dispersion relation in our analysis , we start with equation ( 20 ) and we obtain @xmath85-p'[a_\\gamma-\\theta_3(l_pp')^2\\pm\\theta_8l_pp']=e - e_0=(a^2p^2+\\eta p^4\\pm 2\\gamma p+m^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}-m\\ ] ] this equation has several parameters which should be constraint from experimental or observational data .",
    "another form of this relation can be obtain using equation ( 31 ) @xmath86^\\frac{1}{2}-p ' \\left [ 1- 2 m_{d}^{-1 } p ' \\right]^\\frac{1}{2}=e - e_0=(a^2p^2+\\eta p^4\\pm 2\\gamma p+m^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}-m.\\ ] ] these two relations are more general than ( 25 ) and ( 29 ) .",
    "one can use this relations for an estimation of induced wavelength shift .",
    "however , in which follows , for simplicity we consider only relation ( 30 ) to estimate a typical wavelength shift .",
    "in this paper we have focused on an interaction which contains photons and electrons . in this way , we are able to obtain rather strong constraints on the allowed parameter space from threshold analysis[18 ] .",
    "based on these analysis the photon decay rate goes like @xmath31 above threshold , so any gamma ray which propagates over macroscopic distances must have energy below the threshold .",
    "this threshold now is supposed to be @xmath87 [ 17,18 ] .",
    "if we accept this threshold , we can estimate the value of the wavelength shift due to loop quantum gravity effect in a typical compton effect . for simplicity",
    "we consider relation ( 30 ) . in this relation",
    ", @xmath88 causes the appearance of threshold effects at momenta @xmath89 , where @xmath90 .",
    "it is these effects which allows to explore quantum gravity at energies much lower than @xmath88 [ 15 ] .",
    "carmona and cortes have argued that for @xmath91 and a typical hadronic process , one gets @xmath92 in the case @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the case @xmath95 . in both cases ,",
    "one has modifications to relativistic kinematics at energies below the gzk cutoff , so that the observed violations of this cutoff in the cosmic ray spectrum[15 ] could be a footprint of a lorentz invariance violation at high energies[8 ] .",
    "first we try to find a wavelength shift using carmona - cortes threshold .",
    "suppose that a photon with wavelength @xmath96(which is the wavelength of photon in original compton experiment ) is scattered by electron via compton process at angle @xmath97 .",
    "using the relation ( 30 ) we find an unacceptable wavelength shift : an extremely small negative shift which is unacceptable due to its negative sign .",
    "this may reflect the fact that carmona - cortes threshold is not acceptable on physical ground . using relation ( 30 )",
    "we can obtain a reasonable wavelength shift of the scattered photon .",
    "our calculations show a shifted wavelength of @xmath98 which leads to @xmath99 .",
    "note that we have used @xmath100 to have a reasonable wavelength shift .",
    "looking back to relation ( 30 ) we see that the only arbitrary quantity is @xmath71 . in our situation , only when @xmath100 we find a reasonable wavelength shift .",
    "this threshold is one order of magnitude smaller than threshold presented by jacobson _",
    "so , we may conclude that the reasonable threshold should be @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath101 is the ordinary wavelength shift via compton process . in summary , we conclude that to have a reasonable wavelength shift due to loop quantum gravity effect , threshold effects should take place at @xmath102 . for comparison ,",
    "note that carmona and cortes[10 ] have considered @xmath103 for @xmath93 while jacobson _",
    "et al _ have considered @xmath104[17 ] .",
    "our analysis shows that jacobson _",
    "et al _ framework gives more reliable result of threshold effect .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that lowering of this threshold may affect several of arguments in this research area .",
    "the results of our analysis of compton effect within the framework of modified dispersion relations can be summarized as follows :    * the wavelength shift due to loop quantum gravity effect is wavelength dependent itself . in another words ,",
    "the value of the wavelength shift depends on the wavelength of incident photon . * through a threshold analysis we have found a threshold for the momentum of electron as @xmath100 .",
    "our analysis shows that jacobson _",
    "et al _ framework[17,18 ] gives more reliable result of threshold effect .",
    "* the analysis presented here provides a direct test of loop quantum gravity and lorentz invariance violation .",
    "any wavelength shift of scattered photon after subtraction of ordinary compton shift will show the violation of lorentz invariance and provides a direct test of loop quantum gravity .",
