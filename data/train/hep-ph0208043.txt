    "electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite provides a predictive framework for the computation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most attractive feature of this mechanism is that it relies on anomalous baryon number violation processes which are present in the standard model  @xcite . at temperatures far above the electroweak phase transition scale ,",
    "these anomalous processes are unsuppressed and , in the absence of any @xmath0 asymmetry , they lead to the erasure of any baryon or lepton number generated at high energy scales  @xcite . these baryon number violation processes are , instead , exponentially suppressed in the electroweak symmetry broken phase , at temperatures far below the electroweak phase transition  @xcite . at the electroweak phase transition , non - equilibrium processes may generate a non - vanishing baryon number which may efficiently diffuse into the broken phase  @xcite .",
    "the generated baryon number depends on the cp - violating currents present in the model .",
    "the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis may become effective if the cp - violating sources are strong and , at the electroweak phase transition temperature , the baryon number violation processes in the broken phase are sufficiently suppressed , leading to a baryon number density in the broken phase consistent with observations .",
    "this , in turn , demands a strongly first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "it has been long ago realized that in the standard model the cp violating sources are too weak to lead to an acceptable baryon number density  @xcite",
    ". moreover , even if the sources were strong enough to lead to a reasonable baryon number generation , the phase transition is weakly first order , leading to a strong exponential suppression of the baryon number generated in the broken phase  @xcite .",
    "a minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , instead , has all the necessary ingredients to improve on both problems  @xcite .",
    "first , there are additional sources of cp - violation , associated with the cp - violating phases of the supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "second , in the presence of a light stop , the phase transition may become strong enough to allow the preservation of the baryon number generated at the electroweak symmetry breaking scale  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although there is general agreement on both the existence and nature of the new sources and also on the parameter space leading to a strongly first order phase transition , the results regarding the strength and specific form of the cp - violating sources are still controversial .",
    "most groups working on the subject have found that , for values of the cp - odd higgs mass of the order of the weak scale , the sources are dominated by a term proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denote the expectation value of the neutral components of the two higgs doublets present at low energies  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , however , it has been claimed that this contribution is absent , leading to a suppressed result for the baryon asymmetry contribution within the mssm proportional to @xmath3  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we proceed to perform a critical re - analysis of the diffusion equations leading to the baryon asymmetry and of the sources for those diffusion equations . in particular , we demonstrate that the sources can be expressed in terms of appropriate differential operators times the cp - violating currents we computed in a very recent work .",
    "we find no suppression of the dominant sources proportional to @xmath4 . indeed , we show that the suppression claimed the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite is an artifact of the approximation they used in order to compute the currents .",
    "the organization of the article is as follows . in section 2",
    "we provide the derivation of the diffusion equations . in section 3",
    "we review the derivation of the cp - violating currents and we show explicitly where our results differ from the ones of ref .  @xcite . in section 4",
    "we discuss the results for the baryon asymmetry within the mssm and section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "finally some useful formulae concerning the chargino sector of the mssm are summarized in appendix  a.",
    "we will start considering a system of particles propagating in a non - trivial cp - violating background localized in the bubble wall , where the bubble is expanding with a speed @xmath5 in the plasma frame .",

    "the term on the right - hand side @xmath12 encodes the effect on the distribution of the particle number changing reactions and elastic collisions .    in the bubble - wall frame and neglecting the curvature of the bubble wall the distribution functions can be written as , @xmath13}\\pm 1}+\\delta f_i^p\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the chemical potential , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the energy and momentum of the particle , the momentum - dependent part @xmath17 describes departure of the system from kinetic equilibrium and we have introduced a slowly varying cp - even function of @xmath16 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , which tends to 1 in the absence of forces .",

    "we now define @xmath31 and using the decomposition @xmath32 and the definition of the current @xmath33 we can relate the cp - violating current with the chemical potential and the function @xmath34 as , @xmath35 where , again , we have neglected terms proportional to derivatives of @xmath30 .",

    "the cp - violating forces are provided by the interaction of the different fields with the higgs profiles , which vary along the bubble wall .",
    "these cp - violating forces induce cp - violating currents for the different fields , which lead to @xmath60 after elastic and inelastic interactions with the other fields present in the plasma .",
    "the resulting currents have then two components . the first one , @xmath61 , the background component , is the one that would be obtained in the presence of only the interaction with the background higgs field , and the second one , the `` collision '' component comes from the interaction with the plasma fields and lead to the diffusion process .",

    "@xcite .    to conclude this section we would like to make some final comments concerning the origin of our discrepancy with the results presented in ref",
    ".  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is correctly argued that , in the absence of particle - changing interactions and in the mass eigenstate basis at a given point @xmath18 , terms proportional to @xmath153 only appear in the off - diagonal elements of the two - by - two matrix of green functions .",
    "this is in agreement with the result obtained in eq .",
    "( [ inicio2 ] ) . from here , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite conclude that the sources receive no contribution proportional to @xmath154 at first order in the derivative expansion .",
    "this conclusion is not correct as we will now explain .",
    "first of all , let us emphasize that the particle changing interactions are essential in order to convert the original higgsino density into a left - handed quark one . in the absence of these interactions with the plasma the net result for",
    "the baryon asymmetry will be much smaller than the one required for consistency with big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the higgsino states can not be associated with the mass eigenstates at any point @xmath18 along the bubble wall , where the higgs background is non - vanishing . in order to treat the particle changing interactions",
    "one has to transform to the weak interaction basis .",
    "second , observe that the currents are completely determined by @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the dominant , diagonal contribution @xmath121 ( @xmath120 ) plays no role in the definition of the cp - violating densities at this order .",
    "the cp - violating densities receive contributions from both the diagonal and off - diagonal terms after rotating to the weak eigenstate basis as in ( [ sb ] ) and both contributions appear at first order . therefore , one should compute both the diagonal and off - diagonal contribution to the green functions .",
    "the fact that the diagonal terms have no dependence on the combination @xmath157 does not imply that the sources share such an independence , since the off - diagonal terms in the mass eigenstate basis play an important role when interactions are included . actually , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , depending on the parameter space , the contributions proportional to @xmath158 may be the dominant ones in the generation of a relevant baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "similar arguments can be used to show that the considerations of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , leading to the absence of a dependence of the sources on @xmath157 can not be sustained . indeed ,",
    "@xcite tries to provide a formal proof to these considerations .",
    "moreover , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite neglect the chargino mixing in the interaction terms , in spite of the fact that mixing is essential for a non - vanishing source .",
    "therefore , their treatment relies on an approximation that is invalid in the interesting region where @xmath159 is close to @xmath160 . as we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is precisely in this region of parameters where the sources proportional to @xmath161 become most relevant in the baryon asymmetry generation ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the detailed evaluation of the currents necessary to compute the sources for the diffusion equations presented in the last section was already provided in a previous article  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resulting baryon asymmetry was computed under the assumption that the connection between the sources for the diffusion equations and the cp - violating currents was that presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath162 . in section 2",
    "we showed that , contrary to this assumption , the real sources , eq .  ( [ source ] ) , have a form that depends on derivatives of the cp - violating currents computed in the presence of the background fields .",
    "therefore , the resulting value of the baryon asymmetry is different from the one computed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the baryon asymmetry resulting from the solution of the diffusion equations depends on integral functions along the wall of the temperature dependent value of the sources times exponential factors which are slowly varying along the bubble wall  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the new values can be simply obtained from the earlier ones by integration by parts , taking care of the proper boundary conditions .    as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the total baryon asymmetry depends on two different contributions .",
    "the first one is proportional to @xmath163 this expression , eq .",
    "( [ asymm ] ) , is proportional to the variation of the angle @xmath164\\ ] ] at the wall of the expanding bubble , which tends to zero for large values of @xmath165 .",
    "furthermore , independently of @xmath165 , for large values of @xmath166 , @xmath167 varies only slightly from its value @xmath168 and therefore the baryon asymmetry tends to be suppressed . finally , this contribution to the sources of the baryon asymmetry has a resonant behaviour for @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , it becomes more relevant for moderate values of @xmath165 and @xmath166 and for values of @xmath170 .",
    "the second contribution to the baryon asymmetry depends on @xmath171 similarly to ( [ asymm ] ) , the first term in the expresion ( [ symm ] ) is suppressed for large values of @xmath165 and/or @xmath166 .",
    "although the second term is also suppressed for large values of @xmath166 , it is unsuppressed for large values of @xmath165",
    ". therefore , we expect this contribution to become the dominant one for large values of @xmath165 , particulary in the non - resonant regions with values of @xmath159 very different from @xmath172",
    ".    finally , let us remark that the final baryon asymmetry is obtained by solving the diffusion equation for the total baryon number .",
    "this equation may be easily derived by summing up the diffusion equations for the thirty six chiral quarks of the standard model ( three generations , two flavors of quark per generation , two chiralities and three colors per quark ) .",
    "the sum of the quarks densities is just three times the total baryon number density ( each quark carries a baryon number @xmath173 ) .",
    "the variation of the baryon number is governed by the sphaleron processes , which affect only the left - handed chiral quarks and leptons .",
    "the left - handed quark chemical potentials receive two contributions .",
    "the dominant one may be obtained by solving the diffusion equation for the different colors of quarks in the presence of gauge , yukawa , mass and strong sphaleron interactions . since no baryon number violating processes",
    "are included , the solutions to these diffusion equations lead to an equal number of baryons of a given chirality and antibaryons of the opposite chirality . these dominant densities",
    "may be considered as approximately constant during the characteristic long times in which the weak sphaleron processes take place .",
    "the left - handed densities receive also a subdominant contribution coming from the weak sphaleron interactions .",
    "this contribution is associated with a net - baryon number which , considering effective mixing between the different flavors and colors of quarks , is shared in approximately equal parts by all 36 of them . finally , there is also a net lepton number created which due to charge conservation is equal to the net baryon number .    taking all these considerations into account , and considering the right - handed leptons out of equilibrium , one arrives to the equation @xmath174 where @xmath175 ( @xmath176 is the weak coupling constant ) , with @xmath177  @xcite being the weak sphaleron rate , while @xmath178 is equal to the sum over the three generations of the left - handed up and down quark chemical potentials associated with a given color of quarks , as obtained by solving their diffusion equations in the absence of the slow sphaleron interactions .",
    "in the numerical simulations , we have considered heavy all squarks and sleptons except for the lightest stop , in which case the coefficient @xmath179 , which differs only slightly from the sm result @xmath180 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we show the comparison of the baryon number to entropy ratio @xmath181 computed within the present model with the mean value of the one consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , @xmath182  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen soft supersymmetry breaking parameters in the stop sector such that they lead to a value of the higgs boson mass consistent with the present experimental constraints , and the lightest stop light enough so that the phase transition becomes strongly first order , @xmath183  @xcite .",
    "since the dominant component of the sources comes from the chargino sector  @xcite , the results of the baryon asymmetry depend only indirectly on the stop parameters , through the values of @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "different choices of the parameters lead to variations of the final result by a factor of order one .",
    "since the method of computation has implicit uncertainties of similar order , so far @xmath186 , the specific choice of the parameters does not affect the results for the baryon asymmetry in any significant way .",
    "we have chosen a maximal value of the phase of the @xmath160 parameter , @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , the inverse of the values shown in the figure can be interpreted as the value of @xmath188 necessary to obtain a prediction consistent with bbn .",
    "observe that due to the uncertainty in the value of @xmath189  @xcite , the value of @xmath189 may be a factor 2 smaller than the above quoted mean value and therefore the value of the phase may be a factor 2 smaller than the value obtained by the procedure described above .",
    "hence , from fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] we see that for @xmath165 consistent with the present experimental constraints , values of @xmath190 are preferred .    in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] we present the values of the ratio @xmath191 as a function of @xmath160 , for a fixed value of @xmath192 gev . for small values of @xmath165",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the resonant behavior at @xmath169 .",
    "however , as @xmath165 increases the maximum of @xmath193 is obtained for values of @xmath160 much larger than @xmath159 .",
    "the dominant , non - resonant component has opposite sign to the resonant one and for large values of @xmath160 compared to @xmath159 , it becomes only slightly dependent on @xmath165 , in agreement with our discussion above .",
    "we see that even for large values of @xmath165 , values of the baryon asymmetry consistent with bbn predictions may be obtained for phases of order one .",
    "observe that the baryon asymmetry tends to zero for large values of @xmath160 , since the higgsino component of the lightest chargino , present in the plasma , tends to zero in this limit .",
    "the above results are important in view of the constraints coming from electric dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently observed that , even in the presence of very heavy squarks and leptons , the electric dipole moment contributions may not be small , due to the existence of two loop diagrams involving chargino loops and the non - sm like higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "these contributions are enhanced with increasing @xmath166 , but become rapidly small for large values of @xmath165 and small mixing in the chargino sector .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] show that a relevant baryon asymmetry may be obtained even in this particular regime of parameters .",
    "in this article , we have derived the diffusion equations governing the result for the baryon density generated by the passage of the expanding wall at temperatures close to the electroweak phase transition temperature .",
    "important for this result was the identification of the sources for the diffusion equations in terms of the currents generated by the non - trivial higgs backgrounds , which vary along the bubble wall .",
    "we demonstrated that there are two different contributions to these sources , one proportional to @xmath194 and the other proportional to @xmath195 .",
    "contrary to previous claims , we showed that none of these contributions to the sources vanish .",
    "we clarified the origin of the discrepancy of our results with those of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two contributions to the sources have a different dependence on the parameters of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "while the former contribution has a resonant behaviour for @xmath169 and goes to zero for large values of @xmath165 , the latter has no resonant behaviour and remains non - vanishing for large values of @xmath165 .",
    "the final result for the baryon asymmetry shows that consistency with big bang nucleosynthesis demands the relative phase between @xmath160 and the gaugino mass parameter @xmath159 ( or @xmath196 , if we consider the neutralino contribution ) to be sizeable .",
    "our calculations lead to a bound on the value of the cp - violating phase , @xmath197 , but due to the natural uncertainties associated with our simplified treatment of the baryon asymmetry calculation , and the experimental error in the determination of @xmath189 , we can not reliably rule out the possibility that somewhat smaller values of the phase @xmath198 may lead to consistency with the bbn predictions .",
    "on the other hand , for sizeable values of the cp - violating phase @xmath199 , cancellation of the potentially large electric dipole moment contributions is required .",
    "these contributions are dominated by one - loop effects with scalar particles and gauginos participating in the loop .",
    "these corrections may be efficiently suppressed for large values of the scalar masses of the first and second generation  @xcite . under these conditions ,",
    "non - vanishing corrections still appear at the two - loop level  @xcite .",
    "the most relevant two - loop corrections are enhanced for large values of @xmath166 , but are suppressed for large values of the cp - odd mass parameter @xmath165 .",
    "it is reassuring to observe that even for large values of the cp - odd mass parameter a baryon asymmetry consistent with bbn may be obtained .    in summary within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , the realization of the electroweak baryogenesis scenario requires the presence of a light higgs boson , with mass smaller than about 120 gev , and a light stop , with mass smaller than the top quark mass  @xcite-@xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been found that this baryogenesis mechanism does not guarantee a new cp violating signal at the @xmath200-factories  @xcite .",
    "therefore , apart from the experimental constraints coming from electric dipole moments , a definitive test of the electroweak scenario withih the mssm will come from higgs  @xcite and stop  @xcite searches at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
