    "an understanding of high curvature regimes of a universe is likely to require a quantization of gravity which is non - perturbative and background independent .",
    "background independence means that one does not base the theory on pre - existing causal or geometrical structures because they are to be provided by the quantized gravitational field itself .",
    "not surprisingly , many difficulties in this new setting have to be overcome even when the aim is `` only '' to verify that a proposed theory will have the correct semiclassical limit .",
    "one first has to determine appropriate semiclassical states of the _ interacting _ quantum theory of gravity .",
    "thus , already in the definition of states in which the classical limit is to be probed one has to face quantum dynamics . unlike perturbative quantizations on a background , no exactly known free vacuum state is available which one could use to determine properties of an interacting vacuum state perturbatively .",
    "vacuum or coherent states of general interacting theories then have to be constructed anew , which can show properties quite different from the well - known ( gaussian ) states of free theories or the harmonic oscillator .",
    "although it is often assumed , gaussian states may not capture the right semiclassical properties in any given system .",
    "they may be assumed as `` prepared '' initial states , but crucial deviations from gaussian form can occur especially in systems with long evolution times , for which cosmology is the example _ par excellence . _    quantum gravity is not only an interacting quantum field theory whose interacting semiclassical states are to be determined , it also , in general , has no close relation to a free quantum field theory as it is often exploited in effective field theories of particle physics . for correct predictions",
    "it is , first of all , necessary to determine precise states which capture semiclassical properties . in this paper , a model , introduced in @xcite ,",
    "is studied which is exactly solvable and includes characteristic effects of loop quantum gravity , one candidate for a background independent quantization @xcite .",
    "the model itself is based on loop quantum cosmology @xcite . with new techniques @xcite ,",
    "coherent state properties can be determined explicitly . in this sense ,",
    "the model is analogous to the harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics and it has indeed the same solvability properties as explained in more detail below .",
    "this will allow us to perform a complete dynamical coherent state analysis , demonstrating how properties can differ considerably for distinct systems even when one considers only solvable models .",
    "the model we study is not only illuminating in this regard , but it also is of direct physical interest since it describes non - singular cosmological bounce models .",
    "bouncing solutions of cosmological models have recently received much attention .",
    "although they are generally very special , they can indicate how transitions through the classical big bang singularity may be possible .",
    "many different examples exist by now , which have most systematically been developed in loop quantum cosmology .",
    "most arguments are based on `` effective '' equations which import some quantum effects into classical equations , and which sometimes allow exact analytical solutions ( such as in @xcite ) or can at least be studied numerically ; see e.g.@xcite .",
    "also in this context the above question of what a semiclassical state of an interacting quantum theory looks like is relevant , although it is often overlooked .",
    "it enters in the derivation or justification of those effective equations which are supposed to capture properties of semiclassical states .",
    "if the correct type of semiclassical states is not known , one can not be sure to have included all relevant corrections to the classical equations in the right way . as a byproduct",
    ", our solvable model presents the first case of a complete set of effective equations in quantum cosmology .",
    "our model , used to illustrate semiclassical state issues , is solvable exactly at the quantum level @xcite .",
    "this is much stronger than having analytical solutions of effective equations since full states , including not only expectation values but also fluctuations and higher moments , are under full control . in this sense ,",
    "the system is comparable to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "a complete analysis becomes possible , including e.g.  the evolution of coherent states and their long - term dynamical properties .",
    "this is especially relevant in the light of recent numerical analyses of related models where initial gaussian states without squeezing were evolved @xcite .",
    "we will see that the coherent state structure of the model is much richer than that of unsqueezed gaussian states , with squeezing influencing the general behavior significantly .",
    "this is an instructive example for the importance of a dedicated coherent state analysis , rather than taking over harmonic oscillator properties to a new model .",
    "the model is paradigmatic for background independent quantum gravity obtained from a loop quantization where the usual free field theory basis is not available .",
    "since the bounce model is exactly solvable , it can provide a perturbative basis for quantum gravity including all possible interactions and degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the form of coherent states determined here is relevant not only for the model itself but for quantum gravity in general . at this stage , perturbative inhomogeneities",
    "are not included explicitly and thus the question of how they evolve through a bounce is not addressed in this paper .",
    "we rather show and emphasize that even the unperturbed isotropic situation poses several important questions for how quantum fluctuations of the isotropic mode evolve through a bounce .",
    "we follow a general method , summarized in sec .",

    "the solvable models relevant for cosmology are introduced and analyzed in sec .",

    "in what follows , we will not use a fixed , or any , representation of our quantum system on a specific hilbert space .",
    "rather , we take an algebraic viewpoint and treat the algebra of basic operators , such as @xmath0=i\\hbar$ ] in quantum mechanics , together with the hamiltonian @xmath1 as primary .",
    "the quantities we are most interested in are expectation values @xmath2 , @xmath3 in a given state @xmath4 , which we often drop as a label if no confusion can arise , and fluctuations and correlations @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "higher moments , involving higher than quadratic powers of basic operators , could be included by the same means although we will not need to do so here .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to note that , would we determine all the moments , we could reconstruct the state @xmath4 provided that the moments satisfy appropriate conditions .",
    "the most basic such condition is heisenberg s uncertainty relation @xmath8 ( also called schrdinger  robertson uncertainty relation in this form ) which will be used frequently below . as in @xcite ,",
    "we call all fluctuations , correlations and higher moments _ quantum variables _ since , unlike expectation values , they describe typical quantum properties .    determining the evolution of moments is thus sufficient to find properties of states .",
    "one can side - step the explicit construction of states in a representation by deriving and solving equations of motion for moments directly , such as @xmath9\\rangle / i\\hbar$ ] and @xmath10\\rangle / i\\hbar- 2\\langle\\hat{p}\\rangle{{\\mathrm{d}}}\\langle\\hat{p}\\rangle/{{\\mathrm{d}}}t$ ] . in general , this set of equations is highly coupled because , unless @xmath11 $ ] is linear in basic operators , @xmath12\\rangle$ ] is a function of expectation values and quantum variables . the quantum variables , in turn , will satisfy equations of motion involving moments of higher degree .",
    "( see @xcite for examples . )",
    "this coupling describes the back - reaction of spreading and deformations on the peak trajectory of a state , which is a crucial quantum effect .",
    "it is , for instance , the reason for the usual non - locality in time of effective actions .",
    "this is the place where solvability properties of a model become important .",

    "more generally , this happens whenever basic operators taken together with the hamiltonian form a linear commutator algebra .",
    "our solvable bounce model is precisely of this type .",
    "it is then feasible to solve equations of motion for @xmath16 , @xmath17 and any desired quantum variables directly without taking the detour of first computing a state in a chosen representation .",
    "many representation dependent difficulties can be avoided , such as explicit formulas for inner products and normalizations .",
    "instead , properties of the hilbert space structure , such as the self - adjointness of operators , can be implemented straightforwardly through reality conditions for the solutions of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and quantum variables .",
    "a free isotropic scalar field @xmath18 couples to gravity through the friedmann equation @xmath19 we use canonical variables , explained in more detail in @xcite , whose relation to the scale factor @xmath20 , the scalar @xmath18 and their derivatives in proper time @xmath21 is @xmath22 ( extrinsic curvature ) , @xmath23 ( volume ) and @xmath24 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath25 is the isotropic component of a densitized triad and can be positive or negative for the two triad representations . in",
    "what follows , we assume positive @xmath25 without loss of generality and drop absolute values .",
    "moreover , for later convenience we rescale @xmath18 by @xmath26 and drop factors of @xmath27 such that @xmath28 . solving ( [ friedmann ] ) for @xmath29 , which is a constant of motion , yields @xmath30 , allowing four possible choices for the signs : @xmath31 can be positive ( expanding universe ) or negative ( contracting universe ) , and for each case @xmath29 can take any sign ( such that @xmath18 runs opposite or along coordinate time @xmath21 ) .",
    "we can interpret @xmath32 as the hamiltonian which generates the flow in the variable @xmath18 , playing the role of internal time .",
    "the deparameterized hamiltonian constraint then reads @xmath33 .",
    "this hamiltonian is quadratic , although not of the harmonic oscillator form , and thus solvable as explained above . unlike for the harmonic oscillator",
    ", the hamiltonian does not have a definite sign .",
    "one can easily understand the behavior of solutions , and of the energy spectrum of the quantum theory , by performing a canonical transformation to new canonical variables @xmath34 in which @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes the upside - down harmonic oscillator @xmath37 which obviously allows positive as well as negative energy solutions .",
    "classical solutions can easily be determined as @xmath38 , @xmath39 . in terms of the integration constants",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 , the hamiltonian is @xmath42 .",

    "this assumption implies @xmath47 .",
    "the sign of @xmath48 then depends on whether we describe an expanding or contracting universe , @xmath49 implying @xmath50 while @xmath51 implies @xmath52 . in the first case , @xmath53 and @xmath18 runs opposite to proper time , while it runs along proper time for a collapsing universe . the opposite case would be realized",

    "it is thus helpful to recall the properties of the resulting quantum system as derived in @xcite using the method summarized in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian implies that the system is solvable , which can be exploited to determine explicit solutions @xmath54 and @xmath55 for expectation values of the basic operators @xmath56 and @xmath15 , in full agreement with the classical solutions .",
    "although the functional expressions for expectation values agree with classical solutions , a difference to the classical case is that states may be superpositions of positive and negative eigenfunctions of @xmath1 even though the expectation value of @xmath15 is either contracting or expanding .",
    "we will later discuss the effect of possible admixtures of negative to positive energy states in solutions .",
    "moreover , fluctuations can be solved explicitly by the same methods .",
    "they are @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the correlation . while fluctuations are not constant , they satisfy @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "uncertainty relations require @xmath62 .",
    "typically , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are thus of the order @xmath65 , although the precise value requires more specific information about the state . for dimensional reasons , this must involve the only available scale @xmath48 such as in the form @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "in contrast to the harmonic oscillator where the ground state provides specific values for fluctuations , no distinguished state is available for the hamiltonian encountered here .",
    "later on we will see that the loop quantization does provide more information which one can use to estimate fluctuations .",
    "still , the information will not be as complete as it is for the harmonic oscillator ground state .",
    "the key feature of a loop quantization is that its representation does not provide a @xmath31-operator but only operators for almost periodic functions of @xmath31 @xcite ( i.e.  countable superpositions of @xmath68 with @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is sufficient for constructing a hamiltonian operator which is well - defined and agrees with the classical one , @xmath70 , in low curvature regimes where @xmath71 .",
    "a loop quantization can thus be understood as implying that @xmath31 in the classical hamiltonian is replaced by @xmath72 when it is quantized . instead of @xmath72",
    "one could , of course , choose any other almost periodic function which reduces to @xmath31 when @xmath73 .",
    "the freedom can be restricted by relating the model to quantizations of the hamiltonian constraint as it can be defined in the full theory @xcite .",
    "this distinguishes the use of @xmath72 as it follows from the original derivations in @xcite , although other choices remain @xcite . in any case",
    ", the resulting hamiltonian is no longer quadratic in the variables @xmath74 and thus appears quite complicated .",
    "however , if we introduce the operators @xmath15 and @xmath75 , the _ linear _ hamiltonian operator @xmath76 reduces to the classical hamiltonian when curvature @xmath31 is small , and it depends on @xmath31 only through @xmath77 which is required by loop quantum cosmology",
    ". it can be viewed as a quantization of @xmath78 in a specific factor ordering .",
    "a linear hamiltonian usually simplifies the dynamics very much , but only if the basic variables in which it is linear form a closed algebra ( see @xcite for a discussion in the general context of effective equations ) .",
    "since we transformed from canonical variables @xmath74 to non - canonical ones @xmath79 , the system is not guaranteed to simplify even with a linear @xmath1 .",

    "is the mass of the black hole , which one requires to be positive , selecting the discrete positive series of @xmath80-representations .",
    "note the resemblence of the basic variables @xmath25 and @xmath84 to the variables used in affine quantum gravity @xcite . in that case , as with @xmath82 here , one multiplies the metric with momenta to ensure the existence of representations of the resulting affine commutation relations where the metric is positive definite .",
    "although we use triad variables and do not need to require positivity for them , there are representations where @xmath15 is indeed positive definite .",
    "also in quantum optics , and even for the harmonic oscillator itself , the @xmath80 algebra plays a role @xcite .",
    "] this is the reason for the exact solvability of the system which we will use below .",
    "representations of @xmath80 do not allow one to have a purely positive spectrum for @xmath85 .",
    "thus , any representation space contains positive and negative energy solutions and we will have to dicsuss appropriate restrictions on states to rule out superpositions of negative energy contributions to positive energy states if superpositions of expanding and collapsing universe branches are not to be allowed .    before analyzing equations of motion",
    "we note that the system can be generalized by performing a canonical transformation such as @xmath86 , @xmath87 and using the new canonical variables @xmath88 instead of @xmath74 in the definition of @xmath15 and @xmath82 .",
    "properties of the system to be discussed below are not affected by this re - interpretation of the variables .",
    "such transformations can be motivated by taking into account features of nearly isotropic but inhomogeneous lattice states of loop quantum gravity and possible dynamical refinements of the underlying lattice @xcite .",
    "the special value @xmath89 then corresponds to a fixed lattice as realized in @xcite , while @xmath90 , introduced independently in @xcite , corresponds to a refinement such that the number of lattice vertices increases linearly as a function of volume .      as discussed before ,",
    "the system can much more easily be understood if we do not first solve for wave functions , subject to @xmath91 , and then compute expectation values and fluctuations from solutions .",
    "instead , using a more algebraic point of view we derive equations of motion directly for expectation values , fluctuations and higher moments and solve them @xcite .    for expectation values ,",
    "now simply denoted as @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 in an arbitrary normalized state , equations of motion follow immediately by taking expectation values of heisenberg equations of motion , or by using the schrdinger equation for the state appearing in the expectation value , @xmath95\\rangle=   -\\frac{1}{2}(j+\\bar{j } ) \\quad,\\quad    \\dot{j}= \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\langle[\\hat{j},\\hat{h}]\\rangle=   -p-\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar=\\dot{\\bar{j}}\\ , .",
    "\\label{jdot}\\ ] ] that these equations form a closed system is a consequence of the linear nature of the variables and hamiltonian . in general",
    ", the evolution of expectation values would also depend on all higher moments of the state : during evolution the state spreads and deforms , which then back - reacts on the peak position of a wave packet .",
    "this back - reaction is the dynamical essence of a quantum system , captured in effective equations .",
    "in fact , a state is characterized not just by its expectation values of basic operators but also by the infinitely many quantum variables which specify fluctuations and higher moments of a state .",
    "fluctuations ( and correlations ) can be defined , as usually , by @xmath96 since we use partially complex variables there are initially more than three independent fluctuations .",
    "however , reality conditions to be imposed later at the quantum level will lead to additional relations and reduce the number of independent degrees of freedom to the correct value .",
    "higher moments are defined analogously , using totally symmetric orderings in expressions where both @xmath15 and @xmath82 are involved .",
    "fluctuations are not expectation values of a single operator and their equations of motion do not follow directly as before .",
    "but they can easily be derived using linearity and the leibniz rule .",

    ", all these equations of motion are linear in the quantum variables and only finitely many ones are coupled to each other .",
    "they can thus be solved straightforwardly , such as @xmath99 ( using @xmath100 ) for the expectation values . to decouple the six equations for fluctuations , we first note that @xmath101 and @xmath102 implies @xmath103 with constants @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "moreover , only two sets of two coupled equations , one for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 and one for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , @xmath111 remain .",
    "they yield @xmath112 with further constants of integration .",
    "although we are not dealing explicitly with states , properties of the hilbert space must be reflected in the structure of our quantum variables .",
    "the equations of motion , for instance , are only valid if we understand the quantum variables to be defined with normalized states since @xmath113 has been used , for instance when taking an expectation value of @xmath114= -2\\hbar\\hat{p}-\\hbar^2 $ ] to compute @xmath115 in ( [ jdot ] ) .",
    "the system is , initially , defined through the friedmann equation as a constraint on the space where both the metric and scalar field degrees of freedom are quantized .",
    "after quantizing this equation , it is re - interpreted as describing relational motion in @xmath18 .",
    "loop quantum cosmology provides the kinematical inner product on the original hilbert space where the constraint operator is defined , but not immediately one on the solution space .",
    "such a physical inner product can be difficult to determine explicitly in a representation of states .",
    "it can be derived , for instance , by requiring that basic operators are self - adjoint if they correspond to real classical variables .",
    "this then directly implies that all quantum variables defined from self - adjoint operators must be real , which in our procedure is the analog of using the physical inner product in deriving expectation values through states .",
    "since such reality conditions can be imposed directly for quantum variables , implementing physical inner product properties at this level can be much more straightforward than at the level of states .",
    "one reason is the representation independence of the formalism which allows one to avoid looking for a representation of states in which a computation of the physical inner product may be feasible .",
    "this is especially useful for quantum gravity where the general physical inner product problem is one of the major issues .",
    "in our case , we use one complex classical variable @xmath116 , and thus can not refer to a self - adjoint quantization of @xmath31 directly since no such operator exists at all in a loop quantization .",
    "reality conditions implementing the physical inner product must be formulated in a more complicated way : in addition to the simple adjointness relation @xmath117 quantizing the real variable @xmath25 , we have a non - linear relation @xmath118 which follows from the fact that @xmath119 must be quantized to a unitary operator for @xmath31 to be real .",
    "( however , @xmath120 in the ordering chosen for the definition of @xmath121 . )    taking expectation values of this equation , we obtain a relation between quantum variables and expectation values : using the commutation relations ( [ comm ] ) in @xmath122 we have @xmath123 and thus @xmath124 this condition mixes expectation values and quantum variables , but depends on fluctuations only through the constant @xmath104 .",
    "an initial state thus determines how the reality conditions between expectation values are realized .",
    "the relation ( [ reality ] ) is then preserved in time since @xmath125 is constant as derived in ( [ eomc1 ] ) .",
    "if fluctuations are small , as in semiclassical states , we have @xmath126 which , as it should , is the classical relation satisfied up to quantum corrections .",
    "although not directly related to the physical inner product , we include in this section a discussion of the requirement of a definite sign for the hamiltonian in superposed states .",
    "one may or may not wish to allow superpositions of expanding and contracting universe branches in quantum cosmology , but arguments using the physical inner product in analogy to the klein  gordon equation suggest that only energy eigenstates of a definite sign should be allowed in superpositions @xcite . for a linear system",
    ", we did not explicitly take an absolute value of the hamiltonian operator , which implies that in general we are not guaranteed that only positive energy solutions enter states corresponding to our solutions . in a language",
    "more suitable to quantum cosmology , `` positive energy '' means that at any fixed time @xmath18 we should not allow superpositions of expanding and contracting branches of a universe ( while at different times the universe certainly does not need to be always expanding or always contracting ) . to rule out significant contributions from a superposed branch we have to pose further conditions for our quantum variables ensuring that they arise from expectation values in states which are superpositions of only positive energy eigenstates ( or only negative energy eigenstates ) . in general , expressing the positivity of operators through expectation values can be complicated .",

    "so we can already note here that there are quite unfamiliar properties compared to what one knows from harmonic oscillator coherent states .",

    "this relation also indicates that equally distributed fluctuations are typically of the size @xmath185 and thus @xmath186 .      of particular interest",
    "is the case of coherent states which saturate the uncertainty relations . for the harmonic oscillator",

    "is only a phase factor , @xmath192 and @xmath193 determine the peak and fluctuations of the state .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath194 such that indeed @xmath195 as is well known , these states even describe dynamical coherent states of the harmonic oscillator , i.e.  their form is preserved during evolution .",
    "saturation of the uncertainty relation leaves two free second moments such as one spread parameter @xmath196 and squeezing @xmath197 .",
    "unsqueezed states imply @xmath198 and only one free parameter specifies the width of the gaussian .",
    "our system is different and no operator for @xmath31 ( which would be an analog of @xmath14 ) exists",

    "the form must anyway be different since we are not dealing with the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian .",
    "thanks to the solvability of our model we are still able to determine properties of dynamical coherent states explicitly .",
    "this provides an instructive example of how properties of coherent states , and physical implications , can change when a system is not closely related to a harmonic oscillator .",

    "however , as we already saw , the reality condition allows such solutions only if @xmath244 is large and negative . for states saturating the uncertainty relations",
    ", this implies that @xmath183 is of the same size as @xmath245 and thus too large for the state to be semiclassical at any time .    for the last possibility ( [ 1bii ] )",
    ", @xmath230 can be small compared to @xmath132 . for instance , if @xmath104 is of the order @xmath246 , which is allowed for semiclassical states , we have @xmath247 .",
    "moreover , @xmath248 such that this final possibility does allow semiclassical states with equal spread before and after the bounce .",
    "this confirms the earlier indication that equally distributed fluctuations typically satisfy @xmath249 .",
    "although there is a factor of @xmath133 , fluctuations are rather large due to the factor of @xmath48 which , for a universe with large matter energy , is a large number .",
    "it is possible to have smaller fluctuations which are not magnified by the matter energy , but only at one side of the bounce and at the expense of having much larger fluctuations at the other side of the bounce .",
    "there is an easier way to have symmetric fluctuations if one does not require that all uncertainty relations be saturated .",
    "one can argue that ( [ uncertii ] ) is of primary interest since it determines the fluctuations of @xmath25 and @xmath48 , and that only this relation should be saturated .",
    "if this is done , symmetric fluctuations before and after the bounce are easily allowed .",
    "however , this can only be put in by assumption and not be inferred from conditions at one time after the bounce : only one of the relevant parameters @xmath183 or @xmath184 is controlled by the uncertainty relation at one late or early time @xmath18 while the other one would be suppressed exponentially by @xmath250 .",
    "symmetric fluctuations before and after the bounce can thus not be proven but only be assumed for coherent states of this system .",
    "generically , even a universe which is semiclassical at late times can have been highly quantum before the big bang .",
    "examples for one symmetric and the generic non - symmetric bounces are shown in fig .",
    "[ effbounce ] .     and the spread around it .",
    "generic states have different spread before and after the bounce ( dashed lines ) , while unsqueezed gaussian initial states lead to solutions which are symmetric around the bounce not only in their expectation values but also in spreads ( solid lines ) . [ effbounce ] ]      this seems to be in conflict with recent numerical results @xcite where the @xmath25-fluctuations turned out to be very close to each other before and after the bounce .",
    "indeed , this gave rise to statements to the extent that the universe was as semiclassical before the big bang as it is now .",
    "to resolve the apparent contradiction we have to look at _ unsqueezed gaussian states _ as they were used by construction in those numerical simulations ( explicitly removing phase factors so as to de - squeeze states ) , but are not covered by our preceding coherent state analysis . as emphasized before gaussian states do not saturate the uncertainty relations in this system .",
    "they are thus not coherent , and not distinguished as they would be for usual quantum mechanical systems",
    ". nevertheless , their properties are quite interesting .",
    "let us thus assume that we have a state of the form @xmath251 , supported on integer @xmath25 , with @xmath252 .",
    "although these states have the same form as in standard quantum mechanics , the representation of basic operators is different .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath253 where we sum over integers and the shift by @xmath133 arises from the action of @xmath254 which is a shift operator in @xmath25 . for states which are nearly constant on the discrete scale of @xmath25 ,",
    "the expressions can be seen as riemann sums and approximated by gaussian integrals which one can compute explicitly .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath255 these expressions involving @xmath84 are much more messy than the corresponding ones for gaussian states in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that gaussian states for the system considered here are not natural at all .",
    "nevertheless , the expressions simplify somewhat if one assumes that the state is unsqueezed , @xmath256 .",
    "moreover , for semiclassical states we can use @xmath257 which implies @xmath258 .",
    "then , the leading order contribution to the energy fluctuations , derived using @xmath259 and @xmath260 is @xmath261 and with @xmath262 we have @xmath263 whose left hand side is constant throughout the whole evolution . at late and early times @xmath264 becomes small such that @xmath265 .",
    "this relates @xmath266 which determines the @xmath25-fluctuation to @xmath264 which determines the peak position of the wave packet .",
    "thus , for unsqueezed gaussians we prove that the fluctuations before and after the bounce are the same at times where @xmath267 takes the same value .",
    "since the expectation value solutions ( [ psol ] ) are symmetric around the bounce point for any state , _ fluctuations of unsqueezed gaussian states are shown to be symmetric around the bounce . _    this reconciles our calculations with the numerical calculations of @xcite and reinforces their validity .",
    "however , it also demonstrates that the result of identical fluctuations before and after the bounce is a consequence not of the generic dynamics of semiclassical states , but relies on the assumption that states are unsqueezed gaussians .",
    "it is then not very surprising to find symmetric spreads since there is a single parameter determining the state , other than its expectation values .",
    "the fact that @xmath129 is constant then implies directly that there is a fixed relation between this parameter , @xmath266 , and the peak position .",
    "since expectation values are symmetric around the bounce for any solution , the spread must satisfy the same symmetry in this restricted case . as discussed before",
    ", there is no intrinsic basis in this model to restrict states to such a form .",
    "they do not saturate the uncertainty relations , and even if the gaussian form is assumed but general squeezing is allowed fluctuations before and after the bounce become independent of each other .",
    "there is then an additional parameter @xmath268 and only a certain function of spread @xmath266 and squeezing @xmath268 is fixed at the bounce - reflected point .",
    "this does not suffice to fix the spread to be symmetric .",
    "the precise relation follows by estimating @xmath129 as above , now keeping @xmath269 .",
    "then , @xmath270 with @xmath271 and @xmath272 provides the relation between @xmath266 and @xmath268 in terms of the expectation values .",
    "one could suspect that non - symmetric fluctuations are a consequence of small admixtures of superposed expanding branches on an initial contracting one , while superpositions of energy eigenstates of definite sign might always have symmetric fluctuations . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ superposed ] , we choose two states @xmath165 and @xmath273 at @xmath274 which are peaked at the same value @xmath275 of @xmath25 with the same @xmath25-fluctuations . if the first state is expanding , @xmath276 , while the second one is contracting , @xmath277 , they are sharply peaked at different @xmath48 , and thus @xmath278 .",
    "any superposition @xmath279 , where @xmath273 presents an admixture of a negative-@xmath48 state , is then sharply peaked at @xmath275 . at @xmath280 ,",
    "expectation values of @xmath15 in the two states of the superpositon have evolved away from each other and the combined spread @xmath64 can be much larger than individual spreads @xmath281 and @xmath282 measured in @xmath165 and @xmath273 , respectively .     at @xmath283 , but one being collapsing the other expanding .",
    "after the bounce of the first solution at @xmath205 , the wave packets deviate strongly at @xmath284 .",
    "both wave packets are illustrated by their expectation values and spreads , assumed to be symmetric around the bounce for the sake of the argument .",
    "[ superposed ] ]    this can be analyzed more quantitatively : for simplicity , we assume that the @xmath48-fluctuations of the two states are nearly equal , @xmath285 . in the state @xmath166 , we have @xmath286 where subscripts of 1 and 2 at right brackets and @xmath287 indicate which state is used for the expectation values . now assuming @xmath288 , we obtain @xmath289 thus , the admixture changes the @xmath48-fluctuations only slightly and preserves @xmath290 if @xmath291 is sufficiently small . it would thus be allowed in our approximation , although not in a superposition of only positive energy eigenstates .",
    "we will now see how the admixture can influence spreads of @xmath15 before and after the bounce .    while @xmath292 is constant in time , @xmath293 changes and the initial value which by construction is close to @xmath294 is not conserved . using the behavior of exact solutions of expectation values , one can compute @xmath25-fluctuations at the bounce - reflected point of the initial state . at this time , the two states will , in the @xmath25-representation , have evolved away from each other since one state corresponds to an expanding branch and the other to a collapsing one .",
    "we have @xmath295 in the last step we used the fact that by construction @xmath273 is in the expanding branch at all times considered , thus @xmath296 away from the bounce and @xmath297 .",
    "for instance , at the bounce - reflected @xmath284 of @xmath165 with large @xmath284 , we have @xmath298 and thus @xmath299 due to the large factor @xmath300 for an initial state peaked at large volume , the @xmath25-fluctuation have grown much more than the @xmath48-fluctuation if we pass through the bounce .    to verify that this implies non - symmetric fluctuations we have to compute @xmath64 at the bounce - reflected point of @xmath17 , which is not @xmath284 due to the contribution from @xmath273 . from @xmath301 for small @xmath291 , we have @xmath302 which has its minimum at @xmath303 . the bounce - reflected point for @xmath17",
    "is thus at @xmath304 . evaluating ( [ pspread ] ) at this point , for simplicity assuming @xmath305 which presents a characteristic example for an admixture at large initial volume , gives @xmath306 in terms of the initial values at @xmath283 .",
    "the additional inverse powers of the small @xmath291 compared to the spread of @xmath48 show the growth of @xmath25-fluctuations after the bounce , demonstrating that the superposition will not have symmetric spread .",
    "one could thus suspect that such an admixture , which would not violate our condition @xmath290 if @xmath307 is sufficiently small , could be the reason for unequal dispersions before and after the bounce , while solutions of exactly positive @xmath48 would have symmetric dispersions as explicitly shown for unsqueezed gaussians .",
    "this conjecture can not be true , however , because the solutions we studied earlier only refer to expectation values and dispersions and , due to the decoupling in our solvable model , are completely independent of higher moments .",
    "the preceding construction of the admixture does provide states with suitable initial dispersions and expectation values , but the specific states @xmath279 also have fixed higher moments .",
    "there are many other states having the same expectation values and dispersions but different higher moments , not corresponding to what one obtains from an admixture of a negative energy state .",
    "such states allow for positivity as well as non - symmetric dispersions , which thus can not be an artifact of a negative energy admixture . in short ,",
    "the calculation confirms the intuitive expectation that an admixture does give non - symmetric spreads even if each state in the superposition has symmetric spreads .",
    "but it does not show the converse , namely that non - symmetric fluctuations could only be caused by an admixture of a negative energy state .",
    "a solvable model such as the one discussed here allows a detailed analysis of dynamical coherent states which would otherwise be difficult to handle .",
    "this provides valuable information for quantum cosmology , just as the harmonic oscillator does traditionally for quantum optics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "compared to the harmonic oscillator , our system shows several new properties with implications for cosmology .",
    "although the spreads are not constant for solutions to our system , ratios such as @xmath293 are nearly constant in each pre- and post - bounce branch .",
    "nevertheless , this ratio can , and in general does , take different values in both branches . dynamical coherent states which exactly saturate the uncertainty relations and have spreads symmetric around the bounce point do exist but are not generic .",
    "nevertheless , they are distinguished in a certain sense and can thus be seen as analogs of the harmonic oscillator ground state ( although no unique symmetric state exists ) .",
    "indeed , for such states the scale of fluctuations , @xmath308 , is determined more sharply than without the symmetry assumption .",
    "dynamical coherent states for the loop quantization are not gaussians which turn out to have different and rather special properties .",
    "nevertheless , gaussian states can also be analyzed straightforwardly in this setting , with results being ultimately in agreement with recent numerical investigations .",
    "interestingly , _",
    "unsqueezed _ gaussian states do have identical spread before and after the bounce",
    ". they can not be coherent but may well serve as a special version of semiclassical states .",
    "this illustrates how differently coherent states in a new system can behave from those well - known for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "it also shows that a dynamical analysis of coherent and semiclassical states is always necessary even to select suitable initial states to be evolved .",
    "while dynamical coherent states are difficult to describe in most systems , solvable models make this possible which is now also available for cosmological systems .",
    "as demonstrated , the techniques of @xcite reviewed in sec .  [ method ] provide an efficient way to derive coherent state properties .",
    "moreover , they allow one to see how properties can change under perturbations away from the solvable model , such as by including a scalar potential . although this has not been dealt with in the present paper , our detailed analysis of dynamical coherent states of the solvable system provides crucial information for the zeroth order of such a perturbation theory .",
    "there is only scant information on properties of the present state of our universe other than that it is , to a high degree , semiclassical .",
    "but this does not tell us which semiclassical or even coherent state describes it best . from the harmonic oscillator or free quantum field theories one",
    "is used to unsqueezed gaussians to represent the vacuum state .",
    "but the form of such states depends on the system being looked at , and quantum cosmology is not close to either the harmonic oscillator or free quantum field theory .",
    "moreover , there is no obvious vacuum state for quantum cosmology , and even if a hamiltonian should allow a ground state , it is unlikely to describe a universe able to expand to large volume .",
    "a dedicated analysis as done here shows which coherent states are available and what their generic properties are .",
    "these properties must be taken into account for robust statements about quantum cosmological systems .",
    "for instance , we have seen that squeezing must be allowed for generic states , which crucially changes properties such as the symmetry of spreads before and after a bounce .",
    "in fact , squeezing of semiclassical states often plays a large role for decoherence or the transition to classical behavior ( e.g.  in the context of inflation @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a semiclassical state at large volume of a cosmological model should indeed be assumed to be highly squeezed .",
    "lacking additional input , robust cosmological conclusions can be drawn only with reference to _ generic _ coherent states .",
    "then , no strong restrictions on fluctuations of a state before the bounce are justified .",
    "for all we know , it could have been coherent but with large quantum fluctuations .",
    "although we have proven that the solvable quantum system is _ exactly _ described by the effective hamiltonian @xmath309 ( determining the same equations of motion for @xmath25 and @xmath84 as @xmath1 does for @xmath17 and @xmath310 ) it is possible , depending on the initial state , that the system does not bounce but reaches @xmath136 in finite proper time .",
    "this looks contradictory at first sight since such an effective hamiltonian implies the effective constraint equation @xmath311 with @xmath29 constant and @xmath312 there must be a non - zero lower bound for @xmath25 , the bounce scale .",
    "however , while the effective hamiltonian of our linear system does not receive corrections from quantum back - reaction of fluctuations and other quantum variables , the reality condition @xmath313 is non - linear .",
    "classically , this condition implies that @xmath31 is real and thus @xmath312 .",
    "but the reality condition ( [ reality ] ) now receives quantum corrections of second order in quantum variables which , for suitable states , can remove the bounce .",
    "a state can then enter the `` classically forbidden region '' where @xmath314 while still respecting the quantum reality condition .    as shown explicitly ,",
    "zero volume is reached when the parameter @xmath104 is negative and large .",
    "while this can be achieved respecting the spositivity condition @xmath290 , such a state would never be semiclassical .",
    "thus , _ any state which is semiclassical at one time will give rise to a bounce .",
    "_ these are all relevant states since a boundary condition for modelling our universe , however distantly , is always that there is at least one large volume regime in which the state is semiclassical .",
    "but the possibility of states which do not bounce demonstrates the non - triviality of the result .",
    "simply replacing @xmath315 in the friedmann equation by a bounded function is not enough ; any such replacement would have to be followed up by a coherent state analysis which is much more non - trivial than an analysis of the resulting `` effective '' friedmann equation obtained by the naive replacement .",
    "loop quantum cosmology with a free scalar passes this more stringent test and thus provides the first example in loop quantum gravity where complete effective equations have been computed .",
    "we end by repeating that any physical statements derived from a single model have to be confirmed by a perturbation analysis around the model .",
    "this is feasible in our case , as it is for perturbations around any solvable model , but still requires detailed work which is now in progress .",
    "only such an analysis could justify the transfer of results from single models to our own universe .",
    "it may well be that this removes the bounce through back - reaction of quantum variables @xmath316 on the expectation values .",
    "in particular , it is then conceivable that a state starts out perfectly semiclassically at large volume where its expected volume collapses , evolves for a long time to small volume and all along picks up corrections from quantum back - reaction .",
    "since also quantum variables evolve , it can not be ruled out without further analysis that the analog of @xmath104 does become negative and large close to the would - be bounce .",
    "if this happens , the bounce is avoided for the self - interacting state even if it starts out semiclassically by all possible conditions one could pose .",
    "this is only one possibility out of many which can only be ruled out by performing a comprehensive perturbation analysis for which the results of this paper present the zeroth order basis .",

    "<S> the detailed analysis is remarkably different from what is known for harmonic oscillator coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> results are evaluated with regard to their implications in cosmology , including a demonstration that in general quantum fluctuations before and after the bounce are unrelated . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even within this solvable model the condition of classicality at late times does not imply classicality at early times before the bounce without further assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the quantum state does evolve deterministically through the bounce .    </S>",
