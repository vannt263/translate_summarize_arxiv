    "the last few years have seen several remarkable breakthroughs in the study of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities . these are refinements of the classical isoperimetric inequality , since they control the area distance to the ball with a function of the perimeters difference , and can be viewed as stability results . in this paper",
    "we will deal with the so called _ fraenkel asymmetry _ and the _",
    "isoperimetric deficit_.    let @xmath4 be a borel set , with lebesgue measure @xmath5 .",
    "its isoperimetric deficit is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a ball and @xmath8 is the perimeter of @xmath0 in the sense of de giorgi .",
    "the isoperimetric inequality guarantees that @xmath9 is positive and null only if @xmath0 is a ball .",
    "the fraenkel asymmetry of the set @xmath0 is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a ball centered at @xmath12 .",
    "it is a natural @xmath13 distance between @xmath0 and its _ closest _ ball .",
    "the quantitative isoperimetric inequality , first proved by n. fusco , f. maggi and a. pratelli in @xcite , affirms the existence of a constant @xmath14 , depending only on the dimension , such that for every @xmath15 one has @xmath16 see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for alternative proofs of the same result .",
    "for more on the surrounding literature , in particular for variants or generalizations of inequality ( [ qisop ] ) , we refer to @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .    despite this recent progress ,",
    "the optimal value @xmath17 of the constant in ( [ qisop ] ) is still not known , even in dimension two .",
    "the value of @xmath17 can be defined as @xmath18 this can be seen as a non - standard shape optimization problem , since the class of admissible domains is the class of all measurable sets but the balls . in this paper",
    "we prove existence of a minimizer for this problem in the plane :    [ thm_existence_minimizer ] there exists a set @xmath19 which minimizes the shape functional @xmath20 among all the subsets of @xmath21 ( the ball excluded ) .",
    "this existence result in fact provides a new proof of the quantitative isoperimetric inequality in the plane . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , the minimization problem ( [ shop ] ) was studied in the restricted class of planar convex sets . in particular , one may find the following result in @xcite .",
    "[ thmafn ] let @xmath22 be the class of planar convex sets ; then @xmath23 and the minimum is attained at a particular `` stadium '' .",
    "this optimal stadium will be useful for us in excluding possible minimizing sequences converging to the ball .",
    "in @xcite , cicalese and leonardi addressed the same question , among all the subsets of @xmath24 , by considering the functional @xmath25 ( extended by relaxation to the ball @xmath7 ) defined by : @xmath26 by using an _ iterative selection principle _ and by applying bonnesen s annular symmetrization , they showed that a minimizing sequence for the above infimum is made up of _ ovals _ , that is , @xmath27 convex sets , with two orthogonal axes of symmetry , whose boundary is the union of two congruent arcs of circle .",
    "they proved this result using properties of this family of sets established in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a different approach based on a new kind of symmetrization .",
    "we replace any set @xmath0 by a new set @xmath28 having two orthogonal axes of symmetry and whose boundary is composed by four arcs of circle .",
    "this is done in such a way that the areas of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath7 is an optimal ball , are conserved .",
    "the key point in our construction is proposition [ prop_simmetrizzazione ] where we prove that , for sets converging to the ball , this symmetrization decreases the functional @xmath31 asymptotically .",
    "it suffices then to explicitly compute @xmath31 for this family of sets and to prove that the limit of the symmetrized minimizing sequence is greater than the quantity @xmath32 .",
    "this is done in theorem [ casabcd ] , section [ sec2 ] .",
    "finally , theorem [ thmafn ] shows that any sequence converging to the ball is excluded from being a minimizing sequence for @xmath31 , thereby concluding the argument .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we prove the existence result , theorem [ thm_existence_minimizer ] .",
    "once we know that a minimizing sequence @xmath33 can not converge to the ball , we need to prove that it is uniformly bounded in a sufficiently large set @xmath34 . this is done by proving that we can replace the sequence @xmath33 by a new sequence with a fixed finite number of connected components , see proposition [ perimeter ] .",
    "we conclude in a classical way , using the compact embedding @xmath35 .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] we establish some qualitative properties of the optimal set .",
    "our main contribution is the proof that the optimal set has at least two balls realizing the fraenkel asymmetry .",
    "the case by case proof we provide is lengthy , but rather simple .",
    "we also give a bound on the number of connected components of an optimal set in theorem [ thmqualit ] .    in the last section , we present in detail a possible ( non convex ) candidate for the optimal set for which the value of the functional @xmath31 approximatively equals 0.3931 .",
    "this would give a value of 2.5436 for the optimal constant @xmath36 .",
    "notice that the same value @xmath37 was conjectured in @xcite , where it was also shown that it corresponds to a certain shape referred to as a _",
    "mask_. we will keep this denomination .",
    "we also explain what remains to show that the mask is an optimal set for @xmath31 .",
    "since the class of admissible domains for @xmath31 is composed of any domains but the balls , a convergent minimizing sequence has two possible behaviours : either it converges to a ball or it converges to a domain @xmath19 different to a ball and this will provide a minimizer of @xmath38 notice that , since we are dealing with the fraenkel asymmetry , the convergences of sets that we consider are convergences of the measure of the symmetric difference to zero .    in this section we are going to study the behaviour of sequences of sets converging to a ball . to do that , we will define a new kind of symmetrization of sets which turns out to decrease ( at least asymptotically ) the functional @xmath31 . since our functional is scale invariant , without loss of generality",
    ", we can fix the area of admissible domains equal to @xmath39 , if not differently stated .    in the sequel a special class of sets , named _",
