    "the space - based gravitational - wave detector lisa @xcite is being designed to make very precise measurements of the characteristics of black hole spacetimes .",
    "one source that is particularly well - suited for such measurements is the inspiral of a small ( mass @xmath3 ) compact body into a massive ( @xmath4 ) kerr black hole . depending upon the values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the hole s",
    "spin @xmath7 , such an inspiral will spend several months to several years in lisa s frequency band @xcite , radiating @xmath8 gravitational - wave cycles . by accurately measuring these cycles",
    ", lisa should be able to build a `` map '' @xcite of the spacetime , testing in detail the predictions of general relativity .",
    "as the community begins developing strategies for analyzing lisa s datastream , it is important to revisit and carefully analyze the sources one expects to measure . for extreme mass ratio inspirals , this means understanding more deeply the character of kerr black hole orbits and the nature of gravitational radiation reaction deep in the kerr metric s strong field . of particular interest",
    "are features that might simplify data analysis ( which is likely to be very difficult , given the many cycles that must be tracked ) or that might constitute a strong signature of the spacetime . in this paper ,",
    "i analyze what might be such a feature  a unique signature of the inspiral of a body through the extreme strong field of rapidly rotating black holes .    the key piece of this analysis was first discussed by wilkins .",
    "reference @xcite contains a detailed examination of circular orbits of extreme ( @xmath9 ) . ]",
    "kerr black holes .",
    "( in this context , `` circular orbit '' means `` orbit of constant boyer - lindquist coordinate radius '' . )",
    "one very interesting result given in @xcite is the existence of `` horizon skimming '' orbits .",
    "these are circular orbits of varying inclination angle at the same coordinate radius as the event horizon , @xmath0 .",
    "( despite being at the same radial coordinate , one can show that these orbits have distinct proper separation , and in particular lie outside the event horizon ; see ref .",
    "@xcite , particularly fig .  2 .",
    ") an extremely interesting feature of the horizon skimming orbits is that as an orbit s inclination angle @xmath10 is increased , its angular momentum component @xmath1 likewise increases : @xmath11 for the horizon skimming orbits .",
    "this property holds over a sizable range of radius , out to @xmath12 .",
    "i will call the full set of orbits for which @xmath13 the `` nearly horizon skimming '' ( nhs ) orbits .",
    "this defining property of nhs orbits is opposite to weak - field intuition .",
    "for example , in newtonian theory , orbits at constant radius have @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the same for all orbits at radius @xmath16 ) , which decreases as @xmath10 increases .",
    "intuition from newtonian theory is highly suspect in the strong field of black holes .",
    "however , the true behavior of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath10 is qualitatively the same as in newtonian theory over a wide range of orbital radii and spins .",
    "for example , when @xmath17 , @xmath18 for all circular orbits , so there are no nhs orbits when @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that nhs orbits can only exist when @xmath2 .",
    "this is the smallest spin for which stable orbits come close enough to the hole s event horizon that @xmath19 can switch sign : the property @xmath11 arises because , very close to the black hole , all physical processes become `` locked '' or `` frozen '' to the hole s event horizon @xcite . in particular",
    ", their orbital motion locks to the horizon s spin .",
    "this locking dominates the `` keplerian '' tendency of an orbit to move more quickly at smaller radius ( @xmath20 ) , forcing a body to actually slow in the innermost orbits .",
    "the locking is particularly strong for the most - bound orbits .",
    "as i show below , the least - bound orbits do not strongly lock to the black hole s spin until they have very nearly reached the innermost orbit .",
    "the nhs orbit s @xmath21 behavior follows from the fact that the most - bound orbit locks to the horizon more readily than the least - bound orbit .",
    "this behavior could have interesting observational consequences .",
    "it has been well - understood for some time that the inclination angle of an inspiraling body increases due to gravitational - wave emission @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves carry @xmath1 away from the orbit , so that @xmath22 .",
    "since `` normal '' orbits have @xmath18 , it follows that @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath19 switches sign , then @xmath24 will switch sign as well : an inspiraling body will evolve toward an equatorial orbit . if the change in @xmath10 is large , it could have a large effect on the gravitational waveform .",
    "for example , the spin - orbit modulation of the wave s amplitude and phase is due to motion in the @xmath25 coordinate .",
    "this modulation will be reduced as the body s @xmath25 motion reduces .",
    "since the size of nhs orbits is significant near the `` astrophysically maximal '' value @xmath26 ( the value at which a hole s spin tends to be buffered due to photon capture from thin disk accretion ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , astrophysical black holes might spin quickly enough for nhs orbits to play some important role .",
    "this motivates a careful analysis to see what role , if any , nhs orbits might play in gravitational - wave sources .",
    "i use the code described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which uses the teukolsky and sasaki - nakamura equations @xcite to compute the flux of energy and @xmath1 carried away from the orbit by gravitational waves ) to study how a small body s motion evolves as it spirals through the nhs region . by computing the change @xmath27 at a large number of points , it is straightforward to construct the inspiral trajectory for a small body @xcite .",
    "i find that the total change in inclination angle as a body spirals through the nhs region is very small  at most , @xmath28 .",
    "( see fig . ; note that the _ shape _ of the curves in this figure are independent of the values of @xmath29 and @xmath5 , although the timescales strongly depend on @xmath29 and @xmath5 . )",
    "the inspiral code relies on the fact that circular orbits remain circular as they evolve on an adiabatic timescale @xcite .",
    "it is thus explicitly restricted to the evolution of circular orbits , and can not say anything about the evolution of eccentric orbits , which are much more realistic as lisa sources @xcite . based on the leading order corrections to @xmath24 seen from a post - newtonian analysis @xcite",
    ", i speculate that the change in @xmath10 might be much larger when eccentric , inclined orbits evolve through the strong field . verifying this , however , will require a strong - field radiation reaction formalism that can evolve generic kerr orbits : orbits that are inclined _ and _ eccentric .",
    "such a formalism may need to be based on a local radiation reaction force @xcite , although recent discussion suggests it may be possible to evolve generic orbits using gravitational - wave fluxes alone @xcite .",

    "any unusual features in the behavior of @xmath1 must arise from features in @xmath119 and @xmath118 .",

    "the linear momentum is so much larger , in turn , because the most - bound orbit is strongly locked to the spin of the black hole .",

    "however , it does not lock as strongly : being so energetic , the least - bound orbit only locks as the very innermost orbits are approached . hence , nhs orbits exist because very close orbits are forced to move in rigid corotation with the event horizon .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , binary systems consisting of a small body spiraling into a massive black hole are one of the more anticipated sources of gravitational waves for space - based detectors such as lisa .",
    "the nhs region is still rather large for @xmath125 ( cf .",

    "in other words , the timescale for gravitational - wave emission to change an orbiting body s parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath34 , @xmath1 , @xmath35 ) should be significantly longer than an orbital period : @xmath126 .",
    "( more careful discussion of this point can be found in ref .",

    "it is thus useful to regard the body s true , radiatively evolving trajectory as motion through a sequence of geodesic orbits . for circular orbits , we regard the body s inspiral trajectory as the evolution of its radius and inclination angle .",

    "for example , a point on either the top or the bottom panels of fig .",
    "lying between the most - bound and least - bound orbit curves represents a physically allowed orbit .",
    "radiation reaction will tend to drive this point downward and to the left in this figure : gravitational - wave emission shrinks an object s radius and reduces @xmath1 . for a `` normal '' orbit , as in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : motivate_nhs ] , the body is pushed toward less - bound orbits , increasing @xmath10 .",
    "this behavior was predicted by weak - field calculations @xcite and was recently confirmed in the strong field @xcite .",
    "the evolution is in the opposite direction inside the nhs region  radiation emission pushes the body toward the sequence of most - bound orbits , so that @xmath10 decreases",
    ".    decreasing inclination angle could have important consequences for the gravitational - wave signal .",
    "inclined circular orbits emit waves characterized by harmonics of @xmath128 and @xmath129 ( where @xmath130 is the period of a full range of @xmath31 motion , and @xmath131 is the period of @xmath25 motion ) @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the @xmath25 motion modulates the gravitational waveform .",
    "the waves emitted by a body in an equatorial orbit , on the other hand , depend only on @xmath132  there is no motion in @xmath25 , so the amplitudes of @xmath133 harmonics vanish .",
    "as the orbiting body moves toward the equatorial plane , the importance of the @xmath133 harmonics decreases , simplifying the waveform . observing such simplification would be a clear signal that the small body is evolving toward the equatorial plane .",
    "a rigorous analysis of nhs evolution requires a radiation reaction formalism good deep in the strong field .",
    "such a formalism , specialized to the adiabatic evolution of circular orbits , is given in ref .",
    "the code described there solves the teukolsky equation @xcite to calculate the flux of @xmath34 and @xmath1 to infinity and down the event horizon .",
    "it then applies the proof that circular orbits remain circular ( changing only their radius and inclination angle ) when they evolve adiabatically under radiation emission @xcite to compute the change in @xmath35 . from this information , it is simple to obtain the change in @xmath16 and @xmath10 . by computing @xmath134 and @xmath24 at a large number of points ,",
    "it is not difficult to compute the inspiral trajectory followed by a body that starts in an inclined , circular orbit . an algorithm and code for computing such trajectories will be presented at a later date @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : nhs_seq ] shows some trajectories in the nhs region for the inspiral of a @xmath135 compact body into a @xmath136 kerr black hole .",
    "the hole has spin @xmath26 .",
    "the inspiral time for most trajectories is significant .",
    "the number of orbits around the spin axis of the black hole by the body varies from @xmath137 for the inspiral beginning at @xmath57 to @xmath138 for the inspiral beginning at @xmath139 .",
    "the number of gravitational - wave cycles is roughly proportional to @xmath140 , indicating that waves from the nhs region could contribute substantially to a measured signal .",
    "the inspiral duration scales with @xmath141 , and the number of orbits with @xmath142 .",
    "these quantities should be of interesting magnitude for a reasonably wide range of masses , at least for spin @xmath26 .",
    "( as the spin of the black hole is dialed down to @xmath143 , the nhs orbits lose significance and inspiral through them becomes irrelevant . ) gravitational waves produced in the nhs region will form a significant part of the data measured from inspirals into rapidly rotating black holes .",
    "figure [ fig : nhs_seq ] also indicates that the signature of nhs inspiral is not very large .",
    "although @xmath10 does decrease , as expected , the degree of decrease is quite small . for the inspirals shown ,",
    "the largest change in @xmath10 is for the trajectory that starts at @xmath144 : the final inclination is @xmath145 .",
    "the change @xmath146 is a rather paltry effect , not at all a robust signature of the strong field .",
    "it seems that the unique signature of orbital evolution through the nhs region is not likely to be of observational interest . before dismissing the idea entirely ,",
    "let us speculate for a moment on how eccentricity might affect this conclusion . using a weak - field radiation reaction force",
    ", ryan has calculated the leading order evolution of the parameters of an inclined , eccentric orbit of a kerr black hole due to gravitational - wave emission @xcite .",
    "his results indicate that the eccentricity @xmath147 can significantly magnify the rate at which @xmath10 changes : @xmath148 this relation is derived under the assumption that @xmath149 , so there is no reason to believe it holds in the nhs region . however , it could be indicative of the effect that eccentricity has in the strong field .",
    "notice that as eccentricity varies over the range @xmath150 ( a reasonable range for sources that lisa is likely to measure @xcite ) , the factor magnifying @xmath24 increases from @xmath151 to about @xmath152 .",
    "one can speculate that @xmath24 will be magnified by a similar factor ( at least to order of magnitude ) under strong - field radiation reaction . at this time",
    ", there is no way to tell .",
    "hopefully , strong - field radiation reaction programs @xcite will be able to model the evolution of generic kerr orbits soon .",
    "if this speculation proves correct , then the gravitational - waves emitted by inspiral through the nhs region will contain a very strong signature of the kerr metric strong field .",
    "the result of this analysis is somewhat equivocal .",
    "i have shown that the `` horizon skimming '' orbits found by wilkins are a subgroup of a larger family of orbits , the `` nearly horizon skimming '' orbits existing around any black hole with spin @xmath153 .",
    "the signature characteristic of these nhs orbits is that , at fixed orbital radius , the @xmath37-component of orbital angular momentum increases as the orbit s tilt increases , in opposition to the `` normal '' behavior .",
    "this has the consequence that radiation emission , which carries angular momentum away from the orbit , tends to drive the system into an equatorial orbit  the system s inclination angle _ decreases _ rather than increases .",
    "the fact that radiation emission drives these orbits toward the equator is a consequence of the motion of bodies in the strong field of kerr black holes .",
    "as a body spirals in from large radius , its orbital speed initially increases , in accordance with keplerian intuition that a body in a circular orbit of radius @xmath16 has a speed @xmath154 . as the body gets very close to the black hole , however , its dynamics become dominated by the nearness of the hole s event horizon .",
    "all physical processes become `` locked '' to the hole as the horizon is approached . eventually the motion of orbiting bodies synchronizes with the hole s spin .",
    "the least - bound orbit does not lock as quickly as the the most - bound orbit : close to the horizon , a less - bound orbit moves quite a bit faster than a highly bound orbit , not locking to the hole s spin until the very innermost orbits are reached .",
    "this effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vphi_pphi ] .    as an inspiraling body s inclination decreases , the modulation of its gravitational waveform by the @xmath25 motion decreases .",
    "measuring this decreasing modulation could be an observational hallmark of the kerr strong field .",
    "unfortunately , at the moment the most mature formalism for computing the effects of gravitational radiation reaction on the orbits of small bodies can only tackle the evolution of circular , inclined orbits .",
    "in this restricted case , the total change in inclination angle as a body evolves through the nhs region is quite small  at most , the orbital inclination changes by about @xmath155 degrees .",
    "although i have not examined the effect of this change on the waveform , it is hard to imagine it will be particularly marked .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that realistic extreme mass ratio inspirals will be circular .",
    "when such binaries initially form , their eccentricities are likely to be rather close to @xmath151 @xcite , and remain significant by the time that the binary enters the sensitivity band of lisa .",
    "weak field calculations suggest that the rate by which the inclination angle changes might be magnified by a rather large factor . if we take the leading order results at face value [ cf .",
    "eq.([eq : eccentric_effect ] ) ] , the change might be so strong that the orbit is driven nearly into the equatorial plane .    because the nhs region is so deep in the strong field , however , it is a mistake to infer too much from leading order effects .",
    "further progress will require a scheme to calculate radiation reaction in the strong field for _ generic _ kerr orbits  orbits that are inclined and eccentric .",
    "this may require local radiation reaction forces @xcite , or a clever scheme for extracting the change in the carter constant from the radiation flux @xcite .",
    "the fact that observations might be able to detect a strong signature of the kerr strong field will hopefully motivate future progress .",
    "this work grew out of a more general program to compute waveforms and radiation reaction sequences from extreme mass ratio circular orbit inspirals .",
    "that work , in turn , has benefitted greatly from conversations with lior burko , curt cutler , dan kennefick , sam finn , lee lindblom , sterl phinney , and kip thorne .",
