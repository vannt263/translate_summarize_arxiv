    "in this case we will see that great differences , at least at the level of the mean field approximation , between the blume  capel and the cross pca case will emerge .",
    "one of the distinguishing features of the blume  capel model is the presence of a triple point in the zero  temperature phase diagram corresponding to zero chemical potential and magnetic field . in this point",

    "we prove a similar structure for the zero  temperature phase diagram : the triple point is at zero self  interaction intensity and magnetic field . at this point",
    "the four ground states ( homogeneous plus , minus , even checkerboard , and odd checkerboard ) coexist . due to the presence of four coexisting ground states , an entropy argument similar to the one developed for the blume ",

    "the most important remark is that the triple point is not affected by the temperature , indeed , its position is constantly the origin of the @xmath83@xmath93 plane for each value of @xmath58 .",
    "in other words the mean field approximation confirms the conjecture based on the entropy argument quoted in the introduction  @xcite .    for the sake of completeness we briefly recall this argument .",
    "at finite temperature , ground states are perturbed because small droplets of different phases show up .",
    "the idea is to calculate the energetic cost of a perturbation of one of the four coexisting states via the formation of a square droplet of a different phase .",
    "if it results that one of the four ground states is more easily perturbed , then we will conclude that this is the equilibrium phase at finite temperature .",
    "the energy cost of a square droplet of side length @xmath255 of one of the two homogeneous ferromagnetic ground states plunged in one of the two checkerboards ( or vice versa ) is equal to @xmath256 .",
    "on the other hand if an homogeneous phase is perturbed as above by the other homogeneous phases , or one of the two checkerboards is perturbed by the other one , then the energy cost is @xmath257 .",
    "hence , from the energetic point of view the most convenient excitations are those in which a homogeneous phase is perturbed by a checkerboard or vice versa . moreover , for each state @xmath258 there exist two possible energetically convenient excitations : there is no entropic reason to prefer one of the four ground states to the others when a finite low  temperature is considered .",
    "this is why it is possible to conjecture that at small finite temperature the four ground states still coexist .",
    "finally we note that the mean field prediction for the ferro ",
    "checkerboard phase transition is that such a transition is discontinuous . and",
    "this result does not depend on the value of the temperature .",

    "<S> cellular automata are discrete  time dynamical systems on a spatially extended discrete space which provide paradigmatic examples of nonlinear phenomena . their stochastic generalizations , i.e. , probabilistic cellular automata ( pca ) , are discrete time markov chains on lattice with finite single  cell states </S>",
    "<S> whose distinguishing feature is the _ parallel _ character of the updating rule . </S>",
    "<S> we study the ground states of the hamiltonian and the low  temperature phase diagram of the related gibbs measure naturally associated with a class of reversible pca , called the _ </S>",
    "<S> cross pca_. in such a model the updating rule of a cell depends indeed only on the status of the five cells forming a cross centered at the original cell itself . in particular , it depends on the value of the center spin ( _ self  interaction _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the paper is that of investigating the role played by the self  interaction parameter in connection with the ground states of the hamiltonian and the low  temperature phase diagram of the gibbs measure associated with this particular pca . </S>"
