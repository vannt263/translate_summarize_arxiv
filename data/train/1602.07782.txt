    "heavy electron materials with their rich emergent phenomena provide an important laboratory playground for studying the underlying organizing principles of strongly correlated electrons @xcite .",
    "one of the important recent progresses is the prediction of the fano interference in the scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) and the point contact spectroscopy ( pcs ) , first in ref . and then elaborated in a number of papers@xcite .",
    "the typical fano lineshape in the conductance spectrum has now been observed in a number of heavy - fermion materials including cecoin@xmath1 @xcite , uru@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite , ybrh@xmath2si@xmath2 @xcite , ybal@xmath3 @xcite , and the recently proposed topological kondo insulator smb@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these works confirm the microscopic origin of the emergent heavy electron quasiparticles as the composition of conduction electrons and localized @xmath0-spins .",
    "however , despite of these important progresses , detailed analysis of experimental data has proved difficult , because of the lack of a thorough microscopic understanding of the underlying physical processes behind these techniques , not to mention the strongly correlated nature of the heavy - electron physics and the complex band properties . in particular , it is known experimentally that sts and pcs yield very different conductance spectra for the same individual material and cause difficulty and ambiguity in the interpretation of the experimental data and the underlying physics . for example , while the typical feature of the hybridization gap has been generally observed in sts , it has been missing in many pcs measurements such as cecoin@xmath1 in the normal metallic state @xcite . in uru@xmath2si@xmath2 , it remains unclear if the observation of the hybridization gap in the pcs is necessarily associated with the hidden order state @xcite .",
    "in contrast to stm / sts , it is also highly debated whether pcs can provide useful information related to the electronic band structures @xcite .     with @xmath5 here and ( b ) @xmath6 .",
    "the arrows indicate different pathways for the electron to inject into the lattice that cause spatial interference and modulation to the differential conductance . ]    in this work , we study the physical processes underlying both techniques by using a much simplified toy model under the large-@xmath7 mean - field approximation .",
    "we discretize the lead and the interface between the periodic anderson lattice and the metallic lead @xcite .",
    "the overall setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figsetup ] .",
    "the model has neglected many of the properties of a real heavy fermion system and may not represent the realistic situation of a scanning tunneling or point contact experiment , but it allows us to capture some of the essential features of the underlying physics such as the typical hybridization gap of the heavy fermion system and the interference effect of the electron transport through the interface .",
    "moreover , by gradually increasing the size of the interface , we can see how the conductance spectra evolve from the case of a local metallic tip to a point contact of finite size , which may reveal some of the similarities and differences between sts and pcs in a very crude approximation .    as a matter of fact",
    ", our model reveals not only the band features such as the hybridization gap and the well - known fano interference , but also additional spatial interference effect for electrons entering the lattice through different paths at the interface .",
    "we find that the conductance spectra are highly modulated by the pattern of this spatial interference .",
    "for example , the edges of the hybridization gap that are clearly seen in the @xmath8 configuration could be smoothed out for larger contact , causing possible confusion between the hybridization gap and the typical destructive interference in the fano effect , both of which are seen as a broad minimum in the conductance spectra .",
    "the van hove singularity originated from the two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice model could also be completely suppressed in the @xmath9 configuration .",
    "the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath9 configurations may be connected to the stm measurement on uru@xmath2si@xmath2 , where one may find different conductance spectra for the tip located right on top of an @xmath10-site or in the middle of a cell @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the spatial interference may also lead to asymmetry in the conductance spectrum with respect to the bias voltage . this may be understood as a weighted average in the momentum space and prevent a faithful probe of the local electronic density of states in pcs , in contrast to the case of sts . for heavy - fermion materials , this leads to a constraint on the momentum space and suppresses the probe of the @xmath0-electron spectral weight in pcs , which we believe is one of the major differences between the two techniques . on the other hand",
    ", it also indicates that pcs has the potential to detect certain changes in the fermi surface that can not be averaged out , as studied in ref . .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes in detail the experimental setup and the model hamiltonian , where we derive the current formula by using the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function technique and solve the model with numerical simulations under the large-@xmath7 mean field approximation .",
    "section iii presents our main numerical results and discuss the implication of these results .",
    "we will focus on the effect of the fano interference and the spatial interference and their interplay with the band features including the hybridization gap and the van hove singularity . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss briefly the validity and limitation of our approach .",
    "we start by considering a much simplified model for the experimental setup as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figsetup ] .",
    "the whole setup includes a periodic lattice of the heavy fermion material under consideration and a metallic lead that is modelled by a discretized quasi - one - dimensional chain .",
    "the lead forms a junction with the heavy fermion lattice at one end and extends to infinity at the other end . in this work",
    ", the junction is assumed to have a square cross section of the size of @xmath11 on the lead side which are then coupled to a chosen number of the lattice sites .",
    "figure [ figsetup ] illustrates two different configurations with a junction of @xmath12 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "thus we may tune the size of the cross section and the couplings to control the number of transport channels to resemble the change from a local stm tip to the point contact and study the gradual change of the electron conductance in the combined system . for simplicity",
    ", we have neglected all possible complications such as diffusion or energy relaxation , surface reconstruction , or scattering due to boson excitations at the interface .",
    "this approximation allows us to model the system in a simple way using the standard technique of quantum transport . in this sense",
    ", our model may be considered as a `` quantum '' point contact .",
    "we note that this much simplified model may not be completely appropriate in describing the realistic point contact experiment .",
    "however , as we will show below , it could indeed capture some of the basic physics of the underlying processes and provide us with interesting insight concerning both techniques for a better understanding of the similarities and differences between sts and pcs .",
    "we model the system using the following microscopic hamiltonian that contains three parts , @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 describe the metallic lead ( @xmath17 ) , the heavy fermion system ( @xmath18 ) , and their coupling at the interface ( @xmath19 ) , respectively .",
    "the lead is then approximated as a semi - infinite quasi - one - dimensional chain with a square cross section of @xmath11 lattice sites described by @xmath20 in which the operator @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath23 with spin @xmath24 inside the lead .",
    "we make further assumptions that the electrons in the lead are noninteracting .",
    "we will see that the exact model of the lead will not affect the qualitative conclusion on the properties of the electron transport in the combined system .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian between the lead ( left ) and the heavy fermion lattice ( right ) is written as , @xmath25 which describes the electron hopping into the lattice .",
    "@xmath26 is the annihilation operator of the lattice electron at site @xmath23 with spin @xmath24 and orbit @xmath27 ( corresponding to the conduction or @xmath0-band ) .",
    "@xmath15 is introduced later . here",
    "the hamiltonian is written in real space and the hopping is only allowed between adjacent lattice points within the contact region of the junction .",
    "the detailed form of the hopping matrix may be very complicated depending on the specific geometry of the contact .",
    "for example , in the case of stm , the tip is very sharp so that only one local site at the tip is considered and the hopping of the electrons from the tip to the nearest lattice site may be modelled as a @xmath28 configuration . on the other hand ,",
    "if the tip is located near the center of a unit cell of a square lattice , then the electrons on the tip may have equal probability to hop to its four neighboring lattice sites and this should be modelled as a @xmath9 configuration . in the case of pcs , there may exist hundreds of small contacts on the interface , and each small contact may cover a large number of lattice sites @xcite , which may instead be modelled as a @xmath29 configuration with a large @xmath30 . for simplicity , we neglect the details of the geometry of the contact region and assume constant hopping parameters for each orbit @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ figsetup ] illustrates two possible configurations corresponding to the @xmath29 case and the @xmath31 case with @xmath5 .",
    "now we derive the current formula for the above setup using the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function formalism .",
    "the electron current is given by @xcite , @xmath32\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 2\\frac{ie}{\\hbar}{\\rm tr}\\langle \\hat a_l^\\dag \\check h_{ls}\\hat c_s-\\hat c_s^\\dag \\check",

    "the above formula is exact for a noninteracting system . in general",
    ", the coupling may have more subtle effects on the lattice green s function , but these are all higher - order contributions and can be safely neglected in our case for a qualitative study of the conductance spectrum of the heavy fermion state .    the lesser green s function in eq .",
    "( [ currentformula3 ] ) , however , has a more complicated form ( see appendix [ appendixcformula ] ) , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the fermi distribution function in the lattice .",
    "in addition to the common ( first ) term that may be derived from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem for the lattice system , we find in the above equation a new ( second ) term that is associated with the difference in the fermi distribution functions of the lead and the lattice , @xmath55 .",
    "it is therefore a genuine nonequilibrium effect and originates from the redistribution of the electron energy spectra at the interface due to the difference in the chemical potentials , which indicates that the combined system is not in the equilibrium state and the usual fluctuation - dissipation theorem does not apply .    using the above results , we can eventually rewrite the current formula as @xmath56 , \\label{currentformula1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all the green s functions are written in a matrix form in real space . at zero temperature ,",

    "( [ eqgle ] ) .",
    "it is of higher order in @xmath58 and usually not important in the weak coupling regime with @xmath59 or @xmath58 much smaller than the typical energy scale of the lattice electrons .",
    "however , as we will discuss later , in the strong coupling regime , it can not be neglected and may in fact play a crucial role and cause some unexpected results in the conductance spectrum . as discussed above",
    ", this second term originates from the local nonequilibrium effect that modifies the electron distribution at the interface of the lead and the lattice .",
    "this change in the electron distribution provides a negative feedback and reduces the probability for the electron transmission .",
    "as shown in appendix [ appendixscattering ] , our formula is consistent with the well - known landauer formula @xcite .",
    "heavy fermion systems are typically described by the periodic anderson model , which is , however , a strongly correlated model and can not be solved exactly . for simplicity , we consider the large-@xmath7 limit @xcite ( @xmath60 ) , where , neglecting the finite self - energy , the low - energy quasiparticles can be approximately described by an effective mean - field hamiltonian , @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the annihilation operator of the conduction electron and the @xmath0-electron of momentum @xmath65 and spin @xmath24 , respectively .",

    "we use @xmath80 and @xmath81 to denote the hopping parameters to the conduction electrons and the @xmath0-electrons , respectively , and further assume that both are constant .",
    "we now discuss in detail the resulting conductance spectra calculated for different configurations and input parameters using the above model .",
    "we consider in particular the following configurations : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath29 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . because of the coupling to the lead , the planar translational symmetry of the lattice is broken , so that the self - energy @xmath84 and the full green s functions , @xmath79 , can only be calculated numerically in real space @xcite . in the following , we focus first on the variation of the conductance spectra as a function of the ratio @xmath85 in the weak coupling ( @xmath86 ) case , which is the typical situation for sts . the strong coupling ( @xmath87 ) case",
    "is discussed briefly at the end of this section . in the case of pcs , the coupling strength @xmath88 could be larger because of the direct contact .",
    "however , their values actually depend on the overlap with the electron orbitals in the leads and those on the cleaved surface of the lattice . for example",
    ", @xmath80 could be small if the cleaved surface is not in the conduction plane that is responsible for the hybridization . on the other hand ,",
    "as we will show later , the magnitude @xmath88 only becomes important for the stm case ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "its effect is suppressed for pcs with large @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , for direct comparisons , we study both parameter ranges to see clear the evolution as a function of the size of the contact .",
    "our results reveal important interference effects for electron transport through different channels ( the conduction and @xmath0-electron bands ) and different paths ( different sites at the interface ) .",
    "these lead to the interplay between the so - called fano interference and the spatial interference .",
    "we further show that the spatial interference is equivalent to a weighted average in the momentum space of the lattice electrons .",
    "both effects may interplay with the band properties such as the van hove singularity and the hybridization gap to determine the overall features of the conductance spectra .",
    "we first calculate the differential conductance for the @xmath28 configuration .",
    "it is now well - known that electrons tunneling through both the conduction and @xmath0-electron channels exhibit the so - called fano interference @xcite .",
    "figure [ figfano01](a ) shows the variation of the calculated spectra with the fano parameter , @xmath85 , whose value determines the exact location of the conductance minimum due to the fano destructive interference . for @xmath90 , the tip couples locally only to the conduction band so that the spectrum follows exactly the density of states of the conduction electrons and displays clearly the van hove peak and the hybridization gap .",
    "however , with increasing @xmath91 , a complicated change is seen in the overall features of the spectra .",
    "whereas the right edge is always enhanced and gets sharper with increasing @xmath91 due to the increasing probability of tunneling into the @xmath0-electron channel whose spectral weight peaks at the edge of the hybridization gap , the left edge of the hybridization gap is first suppressed for @xmath92 , and then reappears for larger values of @xmath91 . in the mean time , the van hove peak is gradually suppressed and completely disappears at @xmath93 .",
    "this nonmonotonic variation of the left edge and the suppression of the van hove peak originate from the shift of the fano minimum in the conductance and manifest an interesting interplay of the fano destructive interference with the hybridization gap and the van hove singularity .",

    "the above constraint is not limited to our particular model .",
    "in general , the planar momentum for electrons at the fermi energy is constrained by the projection of the lead s three - dimensional fermi surface on the @xmath178 plane , or the range of the energy dispersion in the perpendicular direction , namely , @xmath179 , where , in our particular model , @xmath180 . hence , in contrast to stm or the @xmath8 configuration , which can probe the whole momentum space of the lattice electrons , the differential conductance in the case of large @xmath30 , as may be the case of pcs , can only sample part of the momentum space depending on the fermi surface of the lead .",
    "this , in combination with the energy conservation condition , may lead to `` dark '' regions in the brillouin zone of the lattice electrons that do not satisfy the constraint and therefore can not be probed . in the heavy fermion case ,",

    "we see in all the cases , the finite @xmath185 leads to a broadening of the spectra . for @xmath90 ,",
    "the spectra then exhibit a broad minimum and become asymmetric with respect to the bias voltage due to the van hove singularity , which could be easily confused with the typical asymmetric fano lineshape at finite @xmath91 . for @xmath93 , the sharp `` mid - gap '' peak is slightly broadened but remains robust for @xmath186 .",
    "it only disappears at an extremely large @xmath187 , where the spectra show a broad peak locating at different energies for the two configurations , reflecting the suppression of the @xmath0-electron contribution for large @xmath30 .",

    "we see no qualitative change in the spectra , except that the asymmetry of the spectra is somewhat suppressed for larger @xmath80 .",
    "this effect comes from the second term of the current formula in eq .",
    "( [ eqconductance01 ] ) , which contributes a nonequilibrium feedback on the interface and partly suppresses the electron transport .",
    "however , further increasing the hopping parameter @xmath81 reveals a small peak inside the hybridization gap , as shown fig .",
    "[ figs2_2](a ) for @xmath191 , or @xmath192 , a very strong coupling between the lead and the @xmath0-electron site .",
    "we hence interpret this peak to originate from the impurity effect introduced by the local tip .",
    "mathematically , this also comes from the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eqconductance01 ] ) . for the @xmath28 configuration , the first term is directly related to the density of states or imaginary part of the lattice green s functions .",
    "however , the real part , which diverges at the edge of the hybridization gap , may also have a large counter - contribution in the second term , leading to the suppression of the conductance at the gap edges and hence the `` mid - gap '' peak . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs2_2](b ) , this peak feature is enhanced for moderate @xmath185 before it is eventually smeared out .",
    "figure [ figs2_2](c ) shows the results for other configurations .",
    "we see the peak is gradually suppressed with increasing @xmath30 , possibly due to the suppression of the impurity state .",
    "we note that the extremely large @xmath135 or @xmath81 may not be realistic in real scanning tunneling or point contact measurements , but they may be realized in some special experimental design .",
    "we have presented systematic study of the variation of the conductance spectra as a function of the fano parameter @xmath91 and the size of the junction interface @xmath30 for a periodic anderson lattice .",
    "our results reproduce the well - known fano interference @xcite and reveal new features such as the spatial interference effect for finite interface .",
    "we show interesting interplay between both effects and the band features including the hybridization gap and the van hove singularity .",
    "our study reflects some of the features of sts at small @xmath30 and pcs at large @xmath30 and shows several essential differences between these two important techniques .",
    "first , the pcs differential conductance is modulated by spatial interference effect , which could suppress some of the band features and , in the large @xmath30 limit , impose a constraint on the momentum space .",
    "it may therefore miss some @xmath0-electron spectral weight at the edges of the hybridization gap . as a possible `` smoking gun ''",
    ", we would like to propose that in the case of kondo insulators , pcs or planar junction might overestimate the size of the insulating gap and yield wrong signatures on the insulator - to - metal transition with doping . as a matter of fact",
    ", the bulk insulating gap in smb@xmath4 was found to be @xmath193mev in pcs and junctions @xcite and @xmath194mev in sts @xcite .",
    "our observation is a general result based purely on the momentum and energy conservation in the @xmath162 limit and may be extended to other materials . for semimetals or topological surface states",
    "in which the fermi pockets locate in a small region of the brillouin zone , pcs might also miss the states near the fermi energy and yield a finite insulating gap .",
    "for example , for the particular lead in our model , it may miss the dirac point at @xmath195 in the surface brillouin zone in smb@xmath4 .",
    "one has to be careful in data analysis . in the case of sts , on the other hand , this is typically not an issue but spatial interference may also occur depending on the location of the tip .",
    "in general , pcs measures a weighted average over the brillouin zone , causing its insensitivity over some electronic features .",
    "however , we expect that phase transitions accompanied with abrupt change of the whole fermi surface should usually be detectable in pcs .",
    "second , in the strong coupling limit , sts may exhibit a mid - gap peak due to impurity effect , while it is not present in pcs .",
    "this peak should not be confused with the very exotic majorana mode at zero bias .",
    "third , pcs often involves many relaxation processes and incoherent scatterings which are not included in this study .",
    "these effects will also cause broadening of the pcs spectra and , together with the interference effect , explain the suppression of the hybridization gap feature seen in many experiments .",
    "for example , in @xmath196 hybridization gap is observed in sts @xcite but not in pcs @xcite .",
    "the realistic situations are of course more complicated . in point contact experiments ,",
    "the junction between the lead and the lattice may contain hundreds of small contacts at the interface with different hopping configurations and different coupling strengths , so the pcs may only be understood as a statistical average of these small contacts .",
    "we have shown that the spatial interference effect strongly depends on the particular configuration of the interface",
    ". however , the results are qualitatively unchanged for large @xmath30 . we hence expect that our toy model captures some truth of the fundamental physics involving the electron transport , such as the fano interference due to the existence of both the conduction and @xmath0-electron channels and the spatial interference effect due to the finite size of the junction .",
    "we further note that the mean - field treatment of the periodic anderson lattice may also miss a lot of interesting physics in a heavy fermion system , such as the effect of the quantum criticality .",
    "a complete treatment also needs to take into account some other details including self - consistent modifications on the local hybridization gap .",
    "this is , however , beyond the purpose of our toy model to give a simple illustration of the underlying physical mechanism of the electron transport alone .",
    "we therefore leave it for future investigations .",
    "nevertheless , our observation of the interesting interplay between these interference effects and the band features such as the van hove singularity and the hybridization gap provides new insights into the electron transport of heavy - fermion materials .",
    "most importantly , we show based on general principles that pcs and planar junction may not be able to cover all the electronic states in the brillouin zone .",
    "these call for caution in interpreting the experimental data in realistic measurement .",
