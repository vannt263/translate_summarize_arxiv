    "in this talk i will review recent progress in heavy flavour production .",
    "current interest in this field is expecially motivated by the need to predict cross sections and estimating backgrounds for collider physics , and by its potential for qcd tests and for constraining the parton densities .",
    "the availability of relatively light ( charm ) , moderately heavy ( bottom ) , and very heavy ( top ) quarks opens the possibility of studying the impact of low scale , non perturbative effects in the production mechanism .",
    "heavy quark production cross sections in hadronic collisions are known to order @xmath0 for the total cross section @xcite @xcite , for the 1-particle inclusive distributions @xcite @xcite , and for the 2-particle inclusive distributions @xcite .",
    "a recent review has appeared in @xcite , where a comprehensive bibliography can also be found .",
    "recently , calculations of heavy flavour production in @xmath1 annihilation at order @xmath2 have been completed @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "their most direct applications are in the field of jet studies .",
    "they are sometimes referred to as @xmath3 mass measurements from jets @xcite @xcite , or as studies of the flavour independence of the strong charge @xcite .",
    "other interesting applications are the study of correlations in @xmath4 momenta @xcite , which is an important systematics in the study of @xmath5 , and fragmentation function studies @xcite .",
    "it is quite clear that other important applications will arise with future @xmath1 colliders above the @xmath6 threshold .    in this talk",
    "i will discuss in more detail problems that go beyond the fixed order perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , i will focus on a recent calculation of soft gluon resummation effects at next - to - leading order @xcite , and on the high transverse momentum heavy flavour production @xcite .",
    "in special kinematic regions , large logarithms in the coefficients of the perturbative expansion spoil its convergence .",
    "in particular , for    * total cross - sections : * * at very high energy , one expects terms of order @xmath7^n$ ] to arise at all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this problem , related to the small - x problem in dis physics , is relevent , for example , for bottom production at the tevatron and at the lhc . * * when we approach the threshold region for the production of the heavy flavour pair , terms of order @xmath8^n$ ] arise .",
    "these terms are relevant for the production of top at the tevatron , for the production of @xmath3 at herab , and for the production of charm at relatively low cm energy .",
    "* differential distributions : * * for the production of heavy flavour at high transverse momenta one expects terms of order @xmath9^n$ ] to arise at all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this problem is relevant for the production of charm and bottom at high transverse momentum at the tevatron , but also , perhaps , for the production of very high transverse momentum top quarks at the lhc . * * for the production of a heavy flavour pair , when the transverse momentum of the pair is small , one expects terms of order @xmath10^n$ ] .",
    "the resummation of these terms is analogous to the problem of computing the transverse momentum of the @xmath11 in hadronic collisions .",
    "most of these problems have received some attention in the literature . in this talk",
    "i will discuss the resummation of logarithms arising from the threshold region , and the @xmath12 spectrum of a heavy quark , since some progress has been made recently on these two topics .",
    "qcd favours soft gluon radiation .",
    "when radiation is restricted because of phase - space constraints , the cross section is reduced ( sudakov suppression ) . suppression may become enhancement , depending upon how big a fraction of the gluon radiation effects are incorporated already in the structure functions , and must therefore be subtracted .",
    "the organization of the large logarithms generated by soft gluon emissions is as follows @xmath13\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a mass parameter related to the typical distance from threshold of the production process .",
    "for example , one may think of the @xmath15 as the average value of @xmath16 . the functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 have a power expansion in their argument : @xmath19 leading logarithmic ( ll ) resummation includes only the term @xmath17 in the exponent , while next - to - leading ( nll ) resummation includes also the term @xmath18 .",
    "in heavy quark production , the born cross - section @xmath20 is of order @xmath2 , and the resummation formula has the expansion @xmath21 since the born and @xmath22 terms are known exactly , one can replace them with the exact result .",
    "this procedure leads to a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , ll resummed cross section .",
    "several groups have developed and applied the relevant formulae @xcite @xcite @xcite , and dangerous pitfalls to avoid when implementing the resummation have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , with the addition of the ll resummation , no improvement in the scale dependence can be expected . in fact , for example , the scale in the value of @xmath23 in the resummation formula is not specified exactly , since its scale variation is of nll order : @xmath24 ( where i used the evolution equation @xmath25 ) .",
    "if nll terms are included , one can expect a reduction in the scale dependence .",
    "formulae for the nll soft gluon resummation have been obtained by    * kidonakis , sterman : for the case of a heavy quark pair produced at fixed invariant mass @xcite .",
    "* bonciani , catani : directly for the case of the total cross section @xcite .",
    "this avoids the need to perform the angular integration numerically .",
    "phenomenological prediction have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "when the @xmath26 pair is emitted near threshold , the quark and antiquark are at rest with respect to each other , and thus behave as a single particle as far as soft gluon emission is concerned ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hvqprod2 ] ) .",
    "a @xmath26 pair can be in a color singlet state , that is to say , in a globally colorless state . in this case it does not emit soft gluons : resummation is the same as for the drell - yan process . or , it can be in a color octet state . in this case",
    "it can emit .",
    "thus the resummation is performed by separating out the singlet and octet part of the born cross section , and applying different soft - gluon resummation factors to them .",
    "the scale dependence is considerably reduced after the inclusion of nll resummation .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : topres ] and in table  [ tab : topxs ] for top production at the tevatron .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "it is known that at order @xmath0 there are graphs ( such as the ones shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : highptenhanced ] ) that give cross section contributions enhanced by a factor @xmath27 .    it can be shown that at higher and higher order , the structure of these logarithms is as follows @xmath28 where one usually refers to the terms up to to first sum as leading - logarithmic terms ( ll ) , and up to the second sum as next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) , and so on .",
    "the formalism for the resummation of these logarithms is the same as the formalism for the inclusive production of hadrons at large transverse momenta , based upon the factorization theorem formula @xmath29 where the structure functions @xmath30 , the fragmentation functions @xmath31 , and the partonic cross section @xmath32 , all depend upon a factorization and renormalization scale @xmath33 . in the case of a light hadron , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be any parton , and the structure functions and fragmentation functions must be measured .",
    "the same formalism applies when one looks at the production of a heavy quark at large transverse momentum , the only differences being that    * the fragmentation function @xmath37 is replaced by the heavy quark fragmentation function @xmath38 .",
    "all partons @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 may also be the heavy quark or antiquark . * the fragmentation function @xmath39 for the heavy quark can be computed @xcite . * the parton density for finding a heavy quark in a hadron",
    "can be computed @xcite .",
    "the formalism for the production of high momentum heavy quarks in @xmath1 annihilation has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the formalism for the production of hadrons at large transverse momenta in hadronic collisions have been developed at nlo in @xcite , and the formalism for the production of heavy quark at large transverse momentum in hadronic collisions has been put together in @xcite .    many applications to lep physics , hadron collider physics , and hera physics have appeared .",
    "the problem that has remained unsolved until now is the following : the fragmentation function formalism neglects mass effects .",
    "it is never clear at what value of @xmath12 mass effects are truly negligible .",
    "it has been known from quite some time that the fixed order ( nlo ) and the resummed calculation of cacciari and greco match nicely at values of @xmath12 above 10 gev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : resfo ] ) .",
    "this would suggest that mass corrections are in fact small .",
    "as we will see , instead , the matching at 10 gev is quite accidental , and mass corrections are large .",
    "the procedure can be schematically defined as follows .",
    "the nlo calculation gives the terms @xmath40 the explicit dependence upon @xmath41 , @xmath12 and @xmath33 is not indicated , and @xmath42 .",
    "the resummed calculation gives the terms @xmath43 if @xmath44 , the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not large ( i.e. , they contain no large logarithms ) .",
    "the only large logarithms are explicitly indicated .",
    "our matched calculation should give @xmath47    this looks simple , but it is in fact not so simple , since the the various terms in the resummed calculation are buried inside the structure functions and the fragmentation functions for the heavy quark .",
    "we thus adopted the following approach : we computed the relevant combinations of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , from the relations @xmath51 in other words , with a mathematical procedure , we find the massless limit of the massive calculation .",
    "notice that this is not a real limit , since there are logarithms of the mass that we must keep . in the following    * fo : fixed order calculation * fom0 : massless limit ( in the above sense ) of the fixed order calculation * rs : resummed calculation * fonll : fo - fom0+rs , the result we seek    the fom0 result is a linear function of @xmath52 , everything else being kept fixed . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : masslesslim ] , mass effects are large : for @xmath53gev and @xmath54 we still see substantial ( 100% ) effects .",
    "another consistency check is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : small_as ] , which shows that the rs calculation tends to coincide with the fom0 calculation for small @xmath23 .",
    "our final result is given by the formula @xmath55 this has the correct properties of being nll accurate , and to include mass effects up to the order @xmath0 .",
    "rs and fom0 calculation obtained at the same transverse mass as the fo , instead of same @xmath12 ( for fo this is different ) to avoid large mismatch due to parton luminosity differences .",
    "+ the value of @xmath56 that we pick has the following meaning : it is the value of @xmath57 at which we believe that the massless formulae make any sense at all . from fig .  [",
    "fig : e_plot ] it is apparent that a value @xmath58 is adequate .    our final results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : band - ms - c5 ] .",
    "a slight anhancement for intermediate values of the transverse momentum is present . at very large transverse momenta ,",
    "a sensible reduction of scale dependence is found .    at ll",
    ", we do not expect any improvement in scale dependence .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : band - ll - c0-mt5 ] , where the resummed calculation is included only at the ll level .",
    "the study of all order resummation of enhanced effects helps to increase the precision of theoretical predictions in heavy flavour production .",
    "nll resummation of soft gluon effects reduces the theoretical uncertainties in top cross sections for the tevatron , and for @xmath3 cross sections at herab .",
    "appropriately matched nll resummation of large @xmath12 logarithms gives a hint of slight increase in the predicted cross section , going towards a better agreement with data .",
    "other ingredients of the calculation also go in the right direction .",
    "non - perturbative effects in fragmentation functions ( the @xmath59 parameter in the peterson fragmentation function ) turn out to be smaller than previously thought .",
    "this is shown by the lep measurements of the @xmath3 fragmentation function , and by detailed study of charm production in @xmath1 annihilation @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the @xmath12 spectrum , with all modern ingredients , is needed now .",
