    "the variability of the light - curve of a lensed object induced by the discretization of the mass distribution of the lens galaxy in stars or other compact objects ( gravitational microlensing , chang & refsdal 1979 ; young 1981 ; paczynski 1986 ; kayser , refsdal & stabell 1986 ; schneider & weiss 1987 ; irwin et al . 1989",
    "; witt 1990 ; wambsganss 2001 ; gil - merino & lewis 2005 ) offers a promising way of studying the unresolved source of the continuum of qsos .",
    "other characteristic regions of qsos and agn , such as the broad line region ( blr ) and the narrow line region ( nlr ) , were considered too large ( rees 1984 ) to be significantly affected by the microlensing effect ( nemiroff 1988 ; schneider & wambsganss 1990 ) .",
    "however , recent studies by abajas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and lewis & ibata ( 2004 ) have shown that , according to the new estimates by wandel , peterson & malkan ( 1999 ) , the size of the blr is small enough to be significantly amplified by microlensing of stellar - sized objects .",
    "other agn components such as the broad absorption line region may also be studied by microlensing ( e.g. belle & lewis 2000 ; chelouche 2005 ) .    in studies by abajas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and lewis & ibata ( 2004 ) a number of plausible geometries for the blr , taken from the complete analysis of robinson ( 1995 ) , have been considered .",
    "these models include , in decreasing order of symmetry , spherical , cylindrical and biconical geometries , which are combined with different emissivity and velocity laws .",
    "additional models for the blr could be found in murray et al .",
    "an expected result confirmed by abajas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and lewis & ibata ( 2004 ) is that the less symmetrical models induce the most interesting distortions in the line profiles .",
    "however , the microlensing of the biconical model has been studied in only two limiting cases , for inclinations 0@xmath0 and 90@xmath0 , in which the crucial effects of differential amplification between the receding and approaching parts of the velocity field are absent .",
    "another important characteristic of the biconical model is that the length of the cones is not a direct estimate of the size of its projected surface and , hence , that the microlensing ( de-)amplification can be strongly dependent on the orientation and aperture of the cones .    in this paper we explore microlensing effects on a biconical model consistent with much experimental evidence ( marziani , calvani , & sulentic 1992 ; wilson & tsvetanov 1994 ) and theoretical work supporting the idea that the flow of emitting gas in agn is anisotropic , preferentially confined to a pair of oppositely directed cones ( zheng , binette , & sulentic 1990 ; robinson 1995 ) .",
    "we consider the microlensing effects at high optical depth on the profiles of the broad emission lines ( bel ) . in ",
    "3 the effects on the continuum are compared with those on the blr .",
    "we then analyze the possible use of this model in explaining the characteristic variability detected in the bel of the quadruple quasar lensed system sdss j1004 + 4112 .",
    "throughout this paper we use the standard notation for gravitational lensing ( schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ) .",
    "all microlenses have a common mass , @xmath1 , and all distances are normalized to the einstein radius associated with this microlens mass . the einstein radius , @xmath2 , projected onto the source plane is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gravitational constant , @xmath5 is the single mass of the stars , @xmath6 is the speed of light , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the angular diameter distances to the lens , to the source , and from the lens to the source respectively .",
    "the einstein radius projected onto the lens plane is @xmath10 .",
    "a standard cosmology is assumed with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",

    "this is a well studied lens system that abajas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found to be a good candidate for observing microlensing of the blr .",
    "given the low number of constrains for this double - imaged quasar we just fitted a singular isothermal sphere plus an external shear to estimate the microlensing parameters , the convergence or optical depth , @xmath16 , and the shear due to the external mass , @xmath17 .",
    "for a and b images the values for @xmath18 are ( 0.30,0.16 ) and ( 0.80,0.72 ) respectively .    the normalized lens equation for a field of point masses with an external shear , @xmath17 , and a smooth mass distribution , @xmath19 , where the coordinate frame has been oriented such that the shear acts along one of the coordinate axes , is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the normalized image and source positions , respectively , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the normalized positions and masses of microlenses . the total surface mass density or optical depth can be written as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents the contribution from the compact microlenses .",
    "a ray - shooting method was used to compute the magnifications maps ( kayser , refsdal & stabell 1986 ; wambsganss 1990 ) . the map of the b1600 + 434b image ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , with an area of @xmath27 at the source plane , was computed covering an area of @xmath28 in the lens plane , and was obtained at a resolution of @xmath29 pixels .",

    ". we have adopted the blr size for high ionization lines of ngc 5548 as 2.5 light - days ( he  ii line , peterson & wandel 1999 ) and from ned the visible magnitude and redshift of ngc 5548 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . to transform apparent magnitudes into intrinsic luminosities",
    "we have made use of the equation @xmath61 , which relates the absolute luminosity of the source , the luminosity distance , @xmath62 , the apparent flux , @xmath63 , and the spectral index , @xmath64 , defined by @xmath65 .",

    "this is the procedure followed by abajas et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where , from an estimated intrinsic magnitude for b1600 + 434 of @xmath67 , the blr radius for this double - imaged quasar is @xmath68 l - days for high ionization lines .",
    "this is a reverberation mapping size obtained , through kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) relationship , from observations of many objects . in principle",
    ", we could suppose that the blrs of these objects are bicones with apertures ranging from 0 to 180 degrees ( spherical case ) and with random orientations . if the bicone axis is pointing towards the observer the reverberation size will depend on the bicone aperture and will approximate zero for small apertures . if the bicone axis were perpendicular to the observer line of sight , the reverberation sizes will be luminosity - weighted radii ( koratkar & gaskell 1991 ) that correspond ( robinson & prez 1990 ) in the case of a biconical geometry to @xmath69 that is , independent of the cone aperture and , hence , coincident with the spherical case . in principle",
    "we should average over all the possible inclinations and cone apertures of the objects considered to derive the relationship of kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to infer the outer geometrical radius of the blr ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , having into account that the bicone orientation perpendicular to the observer is the most probable one and that we lack on information about the bicone aperture we finally adopt the perpendicular case ( that includes the spherical case ) with an emissivity law @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72 , with @xmath73 l - days in this gravitational lens .",
    "this is , thus , an estimate of the intrinsic geometric size ( probably slightly underestimated ) of the blr of one object of luminosity equal to that of b1600 + 434 .",
    "depending on the orientation and aperture of the bicone , this intrinsic size will result in different projected areas in the observer line of sight and , hence , in different microlensing amplifications .",
    "using eq .",
    "8 we have computed microlensed line profiles at different positions on the magnification pattern ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "different values for the inclination , @xmath74 and the cone aperture half - angle , @xmath75 , are considered , as well as two different exponents for the velocity law , @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] corresponds to the @xmath50 case with a cone half - aperture of @xmath77 .",
    "the exponent of the velocity law , @xmath78 , is 0.5 and 2.0 for the left and right panels , respectively . in this limiting case",
    "the bicone is projected along its axis and would appear projected as a circle of radius @xmath79 .",
    "we obtain both strong amplification and significant deamplification of the line emission at different positions in the source plane .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] corresponds to the @xmath80 case with a cone half - aperture of @xmath77 ( notice that now the main component of the velocity is perpendicular to the line of sight and the line profile has only one peak ) . in this other limiting case",
    "the bicone is projected perpendicular to its axis and would appear as a `` bi - triangle '' .",
    "it is evident that for this inclination microlensing effects on the line profile depend on the orientation of the bicone axis with respect to the caustics when the source moves across the magnification pattern . in the absence of any privileged direction in the magnification pattern",
    "this would result in a random effect .",
    "however , in presence of shear , the orientation of the cone axis induces very interesting effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , for instance , a greater number of strong amplification events are found when the cone axis is parallel to the shear ( lower panels ) than when it is perpendicular ( upper panels ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the bicone has an inclination of @xmath81 . for the limiting geometries considered before ( @xmath50 and @xmath80 )",
    "there are no asymmetries induced by the microlensing in the line profile ( figs [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) , assuming that obscuration and optical depth effects are negligible ( see murray et al .",
    "however , for any intermediate inclination microlensing induces relative enhancements between the blue and red parts of the profile depending on the position over the magnification map .",
    "it is even possible to obtain a line profile with one part of the line amplified and other part deamplified .",
    "notice that microlensing effects also depend on the orientation of the projected cone axis with respect to the shear .    in the previous cases",
    "we have considered a rather wide cone aperture ( @xmath82 ) . in the case of a narrower cone aperture ( @xmath83 ;",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) the microlensing effects on the line profile can become extreme .    for the cases @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and both bicone projections respect to the shear",
    ", we have also computed the microlensed line profiles for low ionization lines ( corresponding to a @xmath87=42.02 l - days , which means a @xmath88 ) .",
    "they are shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the effects are less important but still could be detected at some positions .      to obtain some statistical results",
    "we have computed emission line profiles corresponding to the cases @xmath74 , @xmath77 and both bicone projections at the position of each one of the pixels of the magnification map of the b1600 + 434b image ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . for each line profile",
    "we have estimated the magnification , the centroid displacement , an asymmetry parameter and the fwhm defined respectively as @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the amplified line profile and @xmath94 is the non - microlensed profile multiplied by the mean amplification of the map @xmath95 .",
    "we also define the relative fwhm as @xmath96    the resulting accumulated probability distributions are presented in figures [ fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] . in general , microlensing has a statistically significant impact on the line profiles generated by the biconical model .",
    "for instance , for the perpendicular to the shear orientation and intermediate inclination ( @xmath97 ) case , the probability of having a magnification greater than 1 is 38% , the probability of a centroid displacement of a 0.1 is 18% , the probability of an asymmetry greater than 0.2 is 17% .",
    "however , changes in fwhm seem difficult to detect . for the case of ( @xmath98 ) of inclination , the effects are less significant but noticeable .",
    "as expected , the effects are very small in the ( @xmath99 ) of inclination case .",
    "finally , the accumulated probabilities corresponding to the low ionization lines case ( with @xmath74 , @xmath77 and both bicone projections ) indicate that the probability of observing flux variations in the low ionization lines is significantly smaller for the lil than for the hil ( this has been observed in sdss j1004 + 4112 , richards et al .",
    "2004b , gomez - alvarez et al .",
    "however , centroid displacements and asymmetries could also be detected in the lil .",
    "we assume a disk geometry for the region emitting the continuum radiation .",
    "we suppose this disk to have a uniform thickness , @xmath100 , and that the angle between its axis and the line of sight is @xmath47 .",
    "we adopt a brightness distribution for the continuum source , @xmath101 with a power - law index @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this power - law model represents a rough version of the exact standard model ( shalyapin et al .",
    "the continuum flux is computed from @xmath104 ~ \\mu(\\vec{r } ) ~ dv .\\ ] ]    recent determinations by kochanek ( 2004 ) ( see also shalyapin et al .",
    "2002 ) indicate that the size of the continuum source is of about a few light days .",
    "we will adopt a continuum radius of 0.096@xmath2 , i.e. a radius of 6 pixels over the magnification pattern that guarantee a good sampling for the continuum .",
    "this value correspond to @xmath105 l - days for b1600 + 434 .",
    "the microlensing light - curve of the continuum ( or the blr ) is found by convolving the brightness profile of the source with the magnification map along the path of the source over the pattern . in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] several paths are plotted over the magnification pattern of b1600 + 434b .",
    "for the half - aperture of the cones we adopt @xmath106 . in the top - right panel the light - curves for the blr and continuum with @xmath107 are shown .",
    "the middle panels correspond to @xmath84 and the lower panels to @xmath108 .",
    "figure  [ fig13 ] is equivalent to fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , but with @xmath109 . in these figures",
    "we see that the blr amplification may be similar to or even greater than that of the continuum ( blr amplifications two magnitudes greater than the continuum ones can be found in the perpendicular cases ) . for inclinations different from @xmath107 , the degree of correlation between both the blr and continuum light - curves depends on the orientation of the projected bicone axis with respect to the shear .",
    "the correlation is strong when the projected bicone axis is parallel to the shear direction ( left panels in figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] , [ fig13 ] ) but can be substantially reduced when it is perpendicular ( right panels in figs .",
    "[ fig12 ] , [ fig13 ] ) . to gain insight into this study",
    "( see lewis & ibata 2004 ) , we have computed for each position ( pixel ) of the source in the magnification pattern pairs representing the blr and continuum amplification , @xmath110 , where ( from equations [ fluxl ] and [ fluxcont ] )    @xmath111    @xmath112    where @xmath95 is the mean magnification of the pattern .",
    "note that the @xmath113 ratio is related to changes in the equivalent width of the broad emission line .",
    "color - scale histograms representing the frequency of these pairs ( lewis & ibata 2004 ) for different values of inclination and cone aperture are represented in figures [ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] we confirm that the correlation is very strong for the case @xmath107 , is less marked for the parallel to the shear projection of the bicone ( cases @xmath84 , and @xmath108 ) , and is weaker for the perpendicular projection ( cases @xmath84 , and @xmath108 ) .",
    "the probability of finding a microlensing event in a strip of @xmath114 decreases from 78% in the @xmath107 case to 65% in the @xmath108 perpendicular case . in the parallel case ( @xmath108 ) ,",
    "the probability of finding a microlensing event in this strip is 71% .",
    "similar results can be observed in figure 10 .",
    "bel microlensing has been tentatively detected in the quadruple large - separation lensed quasar sdss j1004 + 4112 ( inada et al .",
    "2003 ) with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "blue - wing enhancements have been observed in the high ionization lines in component a spectra ( richards , johnston & hennawi 2004a ; gmez - lvarez et al .",
    "a first enhancement was detected in two epochs in may 03 and was later undetectable in another four epochs from november to december 2003 ( richards et al .",
    "a second enhancement was independently detected in january 04 ( gmez - lvarez et al . 2005 ) , march and april 2004 ( richards , johnston & hennawi 2004a ) .",
    "in contrast , the continuum emission has been maintained unaltered throughout this period .",
    "microlensing of the high ionization bel was the hypothesis originally preferred to explain variability ( richards et al .",
    "however this hypothesis seems difficult to reconcile with the recurrence of the blue - wing enhancement in the framework of the typical disk - like models for the blr : instead of a new blueward enhancement , changes of the core or the red wing of the line were expected in so far as the caustic moves across the blr velocity field .",
    "however , this behavior would not be so strange if a biconical geometry were adopted for the blr . according to what we have previously seen for the case @xmath84 and orientation of the bicone axis perpendicular to the shear",
    ", one can imagine situations in which one of the projected cones ( blue or red ) could be amplified in more than one epoch without noticeable amplification of the other .",
    "in addition , the lack of correlation between the emission in the line and in the continuum is also another characteristic of the biconical model . a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie )",
    "model fitted to the positions of the four images of sdss j1004 + 4112 reveals the presence of significant shear for image a ( @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) .",
    "the biconical model generates a two - peaked profile that can not realistically reproduce the emission lines in sdss j1004 + 4112 .",
    "however , we can consider that the bicone gives a contribution to the blue and red sides of a complex emission line .",
    "another gaseous system will give rise to the core of the line .",
    "this two - component model has been invoked to reconcile the existence of an accretion disk ( that also will generate two - peaked profiles ) with agn observations that typically show single peaked emission lines but with substructure like shoulders or bumps in the blue and red parts of the line profiles ( see , e.g. , popovi et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "thus , microlensing magnification of one of the peaks of the biconical model could produce an enhancement of one of the wings or an asymmetrical shoulder . to add more flexibility to the model we will also consider that one of the cones could be strongly obscured .",
    "thus , our aim with this very simple model is mainly to test whether the qualitative features of the lines variability can be reproduced with microlensing of a bicone or not .    in figs",

    "however the caustic elongation in the shear direction is so strong that the time - scales of the events are not substantially reduced .",
    "the main effect of increasing the mass fraction in stars is to reduce the distance between consecutive stripes in the magnification patterns .",

    "inspectioning the magnification patterns it is possible to find paths to roughly reproduce two consecutive events of relative enhancement of one of the peaks without appreciable changes in the continuum . that considered in fig .",

    "the time between events of the order of 1 year can be obtained by considering that the mean mass of the stars is below 0.5@xmath134 or by supposing a factor two greater relative velocity between the quasar host and the lens galaxy , or by combining both possibilities .    to study the probability of founding repetitive line variations over short time - scales without considerable continuum changes we have computed and statistically studied light curves on the magnification patterns corresponding to different fractions of matter in stars ( 2.5% , 5% , 10% , 15% , and 20% ) .",

    ", we identify , among these tracks , the cases in which at least one of the peaks follows a cycle : enhancement - fading - enhancement ( if both peaks follow the cycle we can consider that one of them is strongly obscured ) with an umbral of variability of at least 0.3 magnitudes ( we have studied the variability of both the flux and the peak intensity ) .",
    "the probability of founding a track with both conditions , continuum variability below 0.15 magnitudes and repetitive line variability greater than 0.3 magnitudes , almost reach the 2% for the magnification pattern generated with a 5% fraction of matter in stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] ) .",
    "thus , the probability of observing this event is small but not neglectable .",
    "figure [ fig19 ] also illustrates other very noticeable effects that a high density of caustics ( originating from the high amplification and shear of j1004 + 4112 ) can induce in the line profiles generated by a bicone transversally oriented and transversally moving respect to the shear ( and , hence , to the caustics ) . because of the dependence of the velocity field with distance , each caustic will mainly affect emitters at a given velocity , enhancing a small part of the line profile .",
    "when more than one caustic affects the bicone , several `` spikes '' can be seen in the line profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] ) .",
    "the displacement of the bicone across the caustics would result in the scanning of the kinematic properties of the blr .",
    "thus , the main trends of the spectral variability observed in j1004 + 4112 could be reproduced by the microlensing of a bicone moving transversally to the shear .",
    "the similarity of the computed phenomenon to the observed line variability can probably be improved by changing the proportion of matter in compact microlenses , by adjusting some of the model parameters ( such as continuum and blr sizes and separations ) or by considering oblique paths .",
    "independently of the details , the qualitative agreement between the proposed model and the observations in j1004 + 4112 supports the existence of an anisotropic gaseous system ( susceptible of microlensing magnification ) in the blr that can give rise to substructure like shoulders or bumps in the line profiles . in the adopted model",
    "the inner and outer radii of the bicone are 9.1 and 16.6 l - days , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the value inferred from kaspi et al .",
    "relationship for the high ionization lines in j1004 + 4112 ( 7.6 l - days ) .",
    "statistical studies make plausible the detection of an event with features like the ones observed in sdss j1004 + 4112 but improbable the future detection of similar events . in the simulations ,",
    "the probability is greater for the pattern generated with a 5% fraction of matter in stars .",
    "we have explored the effects of microlensing at high optical depth on a biconical model of arbitrary inclination and aperture for the blr .",
    "we point out some results that could be of interest :    1 - for symmetric geometries the size of the blr is directly related to its projected area .",
    "however , a biconical blr of any intrinsic size can have a small projected area if the cone aperture is small and the cone axis points toward the observer .",
    "this implies that very large amplifications , even greater than that of the continuum , are possible in microlensing events of a biconical blr . for intermediate inclinations of the cone axis , @xmath140",
    ", microlensing induces relative enhancements between the red and blue parts of the line profile .",
    "2 - microlensing effects ( global amplification , wavelength - dependent amplification ) , are related to the orientation of the projected bicone with respect to the shear of the magnification pattern ( this could result in quasi - periodic effects when the source moves along the magnification pattern ) . in particular , the correlation between the continuum and blr light - curves can be weak when the axis of the projected bicones is perpendicular to the shear .    3 - when the bicone is oriented transversally to a caustic , the emission line profile presents strong enhancement of a small wavelength region ( spike ) .",
    "the movement of the bicone with respect to the caustic would scan the kinematics of the blr .",
    "when the bicone lies in a caustic cluster , the emission line profile can be affected by several `` spikes '' .",
    "4 - we propose that the blr can be composed by two gaseous systems .",
    "one more or less symmetrical that gives rise to the core of the line and other anisotropic , the bicone , that contributes to the blue and red sides of the line . under this hypothesis , the main features related to spectral variability detected in image a of sdss j1004 + 4112 ( recurrent blueward enhancement , absence of continuum variability , and small time - scale )",
    "are qualitatively reproduced by microlensing of the biconical component moving perpendicular to the shear .",
    "the probability of an event reproducing these features is a @xmath137% in the most favorable case , corresponding to a fraction of mass in stars of 5% .",
    "this probability is small but makes plausible the detection of one event under the hypothesis of microlensing magnification of a bicone .",
    "however , future repetitions of the event are improbable under this hypothesis . finally , it is noticeable that we can reproduce the observed variability with a bicone of inner and outer radii of 9.1 and 16.6 l - days , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the expected emissivity weighted radius ( 7.6 l - days ) according to the statistical study of kaspi et al .",
