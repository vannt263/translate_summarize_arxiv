    "it is well known that collisional hydrodynamic viscosity is too small to explain the inferred rate of angular momentum transport in accretion disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "one possible source of anomalous viscosity is turbulence resulting from the magneto - rotational instability , or mri ( velikhov 1959 ; balbus & hawley 1991 ) . in the linear phase , this instability derives its source of free energy from the radial gradient of the rotational flow in the presence of a _ weak _ magnetic field , i.e. , the mri requires the presence of a magnetic field , but is linearly stable if the field is too large .",
    "the properties of mri turbulence , and its effect on angular momentum transport , depend in a fundamental way on the amplitude of the fluctuations in the non - linear state .",
    "we expect this amplitude to be related to the non - linear saturation mechanism of a _ single _ mri mode .",
    "a common saturation mechanism for linear instabilities is the relaxation of the free energy source through quasi - linear processes . for the case of the mri",
    ", this would imply modification of the radial profile of the rotational velocity , but this mechanism may not be available in accretion disks and other astrophysical settings because of strong gravitational constraints that maintain a keplerian profile ( @xmath0 ) . instead , the mri may saturate ( cease linear growth ) if the non - linear evolution of the instability generates a _",
    "mean _ component of the magnetic field that is sufficient to stabilize the mode .",
    "we remark that for most plasma instabilities , if the energy source is fixed and unvarying ( and nonlinear coupling to other modes is ignored ) , the mode will grow without bound , until limited by dissipation or some physical dimension of the system . in this sense",
    ", the mri might be atypical .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the linear growth and non - linear saturation mechanism and amplitude of a _ single _ mri mode in thick - disk geometry , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "our primary tool is linear and non - linear mhd computation in cylindrical ( @xmath2 ) geometry which is periodic in the azimuthal @xmath3 and axial ( @xmath4 ) directiona .",
    "we solve a model initial value problem in which the inner and outer radial boundaries are impermeable , perfectly conducting , concentric cylinders that can rotate independently at specified rates .",
    "they are coupled to the internal flow by hydrodynamic viscosity .",
    "the initial mean ( azimuthally and axially averaged ) profile @xmath5 is keplerian , and in most cases is assumed to be maintained for all times by external forces .",
    "perturbations to the equilibrium that depend on ( @xmath2 ) are then introduced , and evolve dynamically according to the single fluid mhd equations .",
    "linear growth rates and eigenfunctions are found by integrating the linearized , single fluid , visco - resistive mhd equations forward in time until an exponentially growing solution is obtained . the saturation mechanism and amplitude of the mode",
    "are determined by solving the non - linear mhd equations for a single mode , with azimuthal mode number @xmath6 and axial mode number @xmath7 , beginning from a small initial perturbation . at finite amplitude",
    ", the mode will interact with itself to modify the mean background state , which in turn alters both its temporal evolution and its radial dependence . in this sense",
    "it differs from a quasi - linear calculation , in which only the effect of the _ linear _ eigenfunction on the background is accounted for .",
    "our _ primary result _ is that , when the _ mean _ flow profile is maintained as keplerian , the mri can saturate due to the generation of a mean component of the magnetic field that is sufficiently large to linearly stabilize the instability .",
    "the mechanism for field generation is by means of a _",
    "mean _ electric field @xmath8 = @xmath9 = @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 denotes the azimuthal and axial average ; and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the velocity and magnetic fluctuations ) that is produced by the nonlinear interaction of the finite amplitude mode with itself , and is parallel to the mean magnetic field .",
    "this is the well known @xmath14-effect , the correlated product of velocity and magnetic field fluctuations ( moffatt 1978 ) .",
    "it is a fundamental dynamo mechanism .",
    "this suggests that the mri may operate as a dynamo for the generation magnetic fields in accretion disks and other rotating systems .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results indicating that the magnetic energy increases during the onset of mri turbulence ( hawley , gammie & balbus 1996 ) .",
    "finally , when the mean flow profile is allowed to evolve , a single mri mode saturates by relaxation of the rotation profile , as expected .",
    "this is also accompanied by the generation of a mean magnetic field .",
    "thus , the mri dynamo mechanism ( the alpha effect ) may be robust .",
    "our computational results are supported by an analytic theory in which the quasi - linear stresses and mean parallel electric field are calculated explicitly in terms of the linear eigenfunctions of the mri .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "previous work and the model are described in sections [ sec : pwrk ] and [ sec : model ] respectively .",
    "nonlinear evolution of a single axisymmetric mri mode is presented in section [ sec : nl ] , for fixed keplerian flow ( section [ sec : nl1 ] ) and for evolving flow ( section [ sec : nl2 ] ) . using nonlinear single mode computations , the alpha effect for non - axisymmetric mri modes",
    "is examined in section [ sec : asynl ] . in section [ sec : ql ] , the alpha effect for axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric mri is obtained using quasilinear calculations .",
    "we summarize in section [ sec : summ ] .",
    "in early work , the linear theory of the mri has been investigated carefully , and in the past decade nonlinear mhd simulations of the mri have been performed ( see , e. g. , balbus & hawley 1998 ; hawley & balbus 1999 and the references therein ) , including evolution of an mri - unstable system to a turbulent state .",
    "an interesting feature of the turbulent state is that small - scale magnetic fluctuations arise , representing an increase in magnetic energy ( hawley , gammie & balbus 1996 ) .",
    "turbulence generated by mri in global disk simulations is one of the current mri research topics ( armitage 1998 ; machida , hayashi & matsumoto 2000 ; hawley 2000 ; hawley 2001 ; machida & matsumoto 2003 ; reynolds & armitage 2001 ; armitage & reynolds 2003 ; mckinney & gammie 2002 ; nishikori , machida & matsumoto 2006 ; fromang & nelson 2006 ; lyra et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "recently the issue of numerical convergence has been raised in the simulations of the mri .",
    "it was found that the results of some simulations are not independent of the numerical dissipation scale , and physical dissipations should be used ( fromang & papaloizou 2007 ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the mri - induced turbulence in a shearing box with nonzero net vertical flux ( lesure & longaretti 2007 ) and zero net flux ( fromang , papaloizou , lesur & heinemann 2007 ) showed that the physical dissipation , the viscosity and the resistivity , affect the saturated level of mri - driven mhd turbulence , and thus the amount of angular momentum transport .",
    "it was found that the turbulent activity is an increasing function of the magnetic prandtl number .",
    "the dependence of the saturation level of the mri on gas pressure has been investigated by sano et al .",
    "2004 using the local approximation .",
    "based on series of local numerical simulations , a scaling law was also provided that describes the transport of angular momentum in shearing mhd boxes ( pessah , chan & psaltis 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to numerical simulations , analytical methods were used to study some nonlinear aspects of the mri by goodman & xu 1994 .",
    "goodman & xu introduced the notion of whether the mri can amplify very weak initial fields until they reach equipartition with the gas pressure .",
    "they showed that mri axisymmetric modes are exact nonlinear solutions of the local incompressible mhd equations , suggesting that the mri perturbed magnetic field may grow to an amplitude many times larger than the initial unperturbed field .",
    "their analytical calculations assumed a very special form for the axisymmetric mri mode , with a purely vertical wavevector whose field perturbations are purely horizontal ( perpendicular to the rotation axis ) . in this paper , we solve the full nonlinear mhd equations for a single mri mode with perturbations in all three directions ( radial , azimuthal and vertical ) .",
    "we find that large - scale mean magnetic field is amplified through the alpha effect that causes the mode to saturate .",
    "this effect was not studied by goodman & xu .",
    "in fact , the assumption made by goodman & xu may have limited the possibility of the mri mode saturation through the alpha effect , which is the central result of our paper . in the limit of large amplification of mri perturbation ,",
    "goodman & xu also showed that the mri mode could themselves be subject to additional parasitic instabilities ( such as the kelvin - helmholtz instability ) which may destroy the primary mri modes .",
    "the growth rate of parasitic instabilities is proportional to the mri perturbation amplitude .",
    "simulations of these instabilities would require multiple wavenumbers , and can not be captured in single mode ( single @xmath15 ) computations .",
    "however , the saturation _ mechanism _ , a fundamental feature of mri , is not fully understood .",
    "most of the previous studies on the mri saturation have dealt with what controls the saturated level of the mri in a turbulent state .",
    "the most recent results show the effect of physical dissipation parameters on the saturation level using an unstratified shearing box model .",
    "however , these studies have not fundamentally investigated the cause of the mode saturation ( lesure & longaretti 2007 ; fromang , papaloizou , lesur & heinemann 2007 ; pessah , chan & psaltis 2007 ; sano et al . 2004 ) . in this paper , we identify and explain the saturation mechanism of the mri at the level of a single mode . through the nonlinear evolution of a single mode ,",
    "we simplify the problem to better identify the root of mri saturation . using this simple dynamical model",
    ", we find that the instability itself generates a large - scale magnetic field ( mean magnetic field ) through the alpha effect that causes the mode to saturate .",

    "the term @xmath62 contains the nonlinear contribution from the mode @xmath48 interacting with itself , and the operator @xmath63 , which depends on @xmath64 , can evolve with time .",
    "all other modes @xmath49 have and retain zero amplitude .",
    "when the mode amplitude is small ( @xmath52 ) , the nonlinear term is negligible and the linear solution is again obtained .",
    "as the unstable mode grows and @xmath65 becomes finite , the evolution of the background profile @xmath64 can modify the term @xmath66 and this can affect the evolution the mode @xmath48 .",

    "therefore , the nonlinear computation shows that the fluctuation - induced alpha effect amplifies the mean magnetic field in the core and causes the saturation of the mode .",
    "we verify the stabilizing effect of the modified mean magnetic field profiles by performing linear computations of the saturated state , as described in section 3 .",
    "these computations use the _ background _ profiles near the time of saturation . in this way we are able to calculate the linear growth rates of any resulting instabilities .",
    "each linear computation is initialized with perturbation of a single fourier mode ( m=0 and k=6 ) and the equilibrium profiles .",
    "for each linear computation , the equilibrium profiles are the mean ( m=0 and k=0 component ) magnetic and velocity fields taken from the single mode nonlinear computation at a specific time near the saturated state ( e. g. @xmath91 marked in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig3](b ) .",
    "as the mean vertical magnetic field amplifies from @xmath92 to @xmath93 by the alpha effect in the plasma core , the resulting mode growth rate obtained from the linear computation substantially decreases ( fig.3 ( c ) ) .",
    "we find that the dynamics of the saturation and the resulting alpha effect is independent of axial wave number k. to illustrate this effect , we have performed nonlinear computation of a single mode with higher k ( k=30 ) shown in fig.3 ( d ) .",
    "the mode with k=30 grows faster than k=6 with a growth rate @xmath95 and starts to saturate around t=0.007 .",
    "the saturation level for this mode is lower than k=6 mode .",

    "are also shown in fig .",
    "three separate linear computations are initialized at times @xmath96@xmath97 shown in fig .",
    "because the linear computations have been started with the saturated mean fields , the linear growth rates obtained from these three computations are zero or negative , as seen in fig .",
    "the linear stability computations thus show that the amplification of the mean vertical magnetic field by the azimuthal component of the alpha effect @xmath90 suppresses the mode growth and thus causes the mode saturation .",

    "it is seen that the structure is slightly broader for lower s , which is expected because of higher dissipation at lower s. similar radial mode structure ( @xmath131 ) with peaked structure near the inner radius has also been obtained in earlier work by curry , pudritz & sutherland 1994 and blokland et al .",
    "we can similarly evaluate the fluid stresses that alter the flow .",

    "in summary , we have shown that the mri will generate large - scale magnetic field as a mechanism for saturation .",

    "the influence of multiple modes and mode coupling will be of considerable importance . in a future work",
    "we will investigated the mri saturation via the alpha effect using the full nonlinear computations with multiple modes .",
    "the field generated is large - scale in that it is symmetric in toroidal and axial directions .",
    "however , it varies radially such that the total toroidal and axial magnetic flux within the plasma does not change significantly in time .",
    "thus , the examples studied here would not be defined as a `` large - scale dynamo . ''",
