    "relatively little work has been done on heavy baryons using lattice qcd .",
    "the most complete study in a relativistic framework is the one done in the ukqcd collaboration@xcite for both charm and bottom flavoured baryons using an @xmath0 improved fermion action in quenched approximation . in",
    "that work hyperfine splittings in both charm and bottom baryons were found to be considerably smaller than those predicted by phenomenological models@xcite and observed experimentally .",
    "a recent nrqcd calculation@xcite was able to resolve the hyperfine splittings for baryons with b quarks and found values in accord with phenomenological expectations . since the hyperfine splitting is an important feature of the baryon spectrum further investigation of charmed baryons seems justified .    in this work we present the results of another quenched lattice simulation for charmed baryons .",
    "due to limitations in computing resources it was not possible to use the same lattice spacing and volume as used in the ukqcd calculation .",
    "rather we work on a more coarse lattice ( @xmath10.2fm ) with a highly improved action .",
    "past experience has shown that results of reasonable accuracy may be obtained with such lattices@xcite . in order to check the calculation ,",
    "the spectrum of baryons in the light quark ( u , d , s ) sector was calculated at the same time . as well , meson masses for both heavy and light quarks were calculated .",
    "the results of all these calculations are in reasonable agreement with experimental values and with the results obtained at small lattice spacing@xcite .",
    "the simulation reported here differs from @xcite in two other respects . in @xcite",
    "the interpolating operators used for the baryons were taken to have a form which emphasizes the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "secondly , the spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 @xmath2-like baryons are interpolated by the same operator , a rarita - schwinger spin-3/2 field . as is well known@xcite , the correlator of such a field propagates both @xmath3 and @xmath4 states and it is the @xmath3 projection of this correlator that is identified with the @xmath2-like baryons in @xcite .",
    "the procedure used here is different .",
    "as has been done in the context of a qcd sum rule calculation@xcite , the interpolating fields used for heavy baryons are taken to have the same form as those used in the light quark sector .",
    "the @xmath3 @xmath2 baryon has an interpolating operator which is distinct from that used for the @xmath4 @xmath5 , just as the nucleon is usually interpolated by a field that is distinct from the @xmath6 .",
    "no assumption is made about heavy quark symmetry .",
    "an advantage of this is that we can use the same procedure ( and computer code ) at all masses which provides some check on the results .",
    "the correlation function used to extract the masses of @xmath2 s is not obtained from the projection of the @xmath4 field s correlator .",
    "in fact , it seems that the spin 1/2 projection of this correlator has very poor overlap with the @xmath3 ground state .",
    "our finding is that the spin 1/2 projected correlator is very small and noisy compared to the correlator calculated directly using a spin 1/2 field .",
    "the final conclusion of this study is that in quenched lattice qcd the hyperfine splittings for both singly and doubly charmed baryons are in reasonable agreement with phenomenological expectations .",
    "indications are that the splittings may be overestimated compared to experiment which seems to be a common tendency for quenched qcd simulations of baryons at all quark masses .",
    "the calculation is done on an anisotropic lattice@xcite using the gauge field action    @xmath7 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where ps and rs denote spatial plaquettes and spatial planar @xmath8 rectangles respectively .",
    "the plaquettes lying in the temporal - spatial planes are denoted by pt while rectangles with the long side in a spatial(temporal ) direction are labeled by rst(rts ) .",
    "the c coefficients incorporate the aspect ratio @xmath9 and gauge link renormalization factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these renormalization factors are estimated using the link expectation value in landau gauge .",
    "the fermion action is of the anisotropic d234 type@xcite and has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 the c coefficients in the fermion action include the aspect ratio , link renormalization and the hopping parameter factors and are shown in table [ action ] .",
    ".[action]coefficients appearing in the gauge and fermion actions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( a more complete tabulation from various models may be found in @xcite . ) as might expected , without experimental constraints , the model calculations vary over a considerable range .",
    "the mass splittings from our quenched qcd simulation , 84(13)(5)mev for @xmath17 and 78(7)(5)mev for @xmath18 , are substantial and lie in the middle of the range covered by the models listed in table [ ccbmasses ] .",
    "they are only slightly smaller than the hyperfine splittings found for singly charmed baryons .",
    "hadron masses were calculated with an improved action on an anisotropic lattice with a spatial lattice spacing of about 0.2fm .",
    "comparison with simulations done at small lattice spacings and extrapolated to the continuum indicate that lattice spacing errors are less than 10% .",
    "the focus of this study is charmed baryons . for",
    "both singly and doubly charmed baryons spin splittings were found to be in agreement with expectations of quark models and other phenomenological approaches .",
    "the splittings for singly charmed baryons are somewhat larger than experimental values .",
    "this is in contrast to the small hyperfine effects for singly charmed baryons reported by the ukqcd collaboration@xcite .",
    "the calculations reported here were done on a small lattice at a relatively large lattice spacing . by doing a unified study for light and heavy quark masses and comparing to continuum results",
    "where possible we have some confidence that the correct qualitative pattern of hyperfine effects in charmed baryons has been established for quenched lattice qcd . for a precise calculation ,",
    "finite volume and lattice spacing issues have to be addressed .",
    "it is hoped that this can be done in the near future .",
