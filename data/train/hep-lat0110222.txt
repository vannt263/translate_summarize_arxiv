    "the new equations of motions can be integrated leading to    r@= l j_i & constant + _ i & _ i t + _ i  .",
    "such a system is called integrable and each trajectory lies on an @xmath2-dimensional torus .",
    "if this procedure is not possible , we have to deal with a non - integrable systems .",
    "when one adds a non - integrable hamiltonian @xmath7 to an integrable one @xmath8 h(j , ) = h_0(j ) + h_1(j , )  , one can show that the system can not be integrated by perturbation theory for rational frequency ratios =  z  . the famous kam theorem due to kolmogorov , arnold , and moser states that tori with @xmath9 sufficiently irrational are stable under small perturbations .",
    "non - integrable systems possess trajectories filling the phase space ergodically and are intrinsically related to chaotic motion . with the kam - theorem",
    "we get insight into the behavior of a system which is driven by some ( order ) parameter from regularity to chaos  @xcite .",
    "it is a fascinating question in which manner classical chaos is reflected in quantum systems .",
    "quantum mechanics is associated with the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath10 in the stationary case @xmath11 one deals with the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath12 this is a linear differential equation and its solution behaves regularly in time . due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath13 the concept of trajectories is not adequate .",
    "therefore , the question has be posed : are there differences in the eigenvalue spectra of classically integrable and non - integrable systems ?    billiards became a preferred playground to study both the classical and quantum case .",
    "some of the most important ones are depicted in fig .",
    "it was the arrival of computers with increasing power in the late seventies when diagonalization of matrices with reasonable size became possible .",
    "the behavior of the distribution of the spacings between neighboring eigenvalues turned out to be a decisive signature . in 1979 mcdonald and kaufman performed a comparison between the spectra from a classically regular and a classically chaotic system  @xcite . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] they observed a qualitatively different behavior between the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution of the circle and the stadium . in the first case the spacings are clearly concentrated around zero while they show repelling character in the second case .",
    "there were several authors contributing to this discussion and we mention the papers by casati , valz - gris , and guarneri  @xcite , by berry  @xcite , by robnik  @xcite and by seligman , verbaarschot , and zirnbauer  @xcite .",
    "very accurate results were obtained for the classically chaotic sinai billiard by bohigas , giannoni , and schmit ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) which led them to the important conclusion  @xcite : spectra of time - reversal invariant systems whose classical analogues are k systems show the same fluctuation properties as predicted by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random - matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "k systems are most strongly mixing classical systems with a positive kolmogorov entropy .",
    "the conjecture turned out valid also for less chaotic ( ergodic ) systems without time - reversal invariance leading to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "in lack of analytical or numerical methods to obtain the spectra of complicated hamiltonians , wigner and dyson analyzed ensembles of random matrices and were able to derive mathematical expressions .",
    "a gaussian random matrix ensemble consists of square matrices with their matrix elements drawn from a gaussian distribution @xmath14 one distinguishes between three different types depending on space - time symmetry classified by the dyson parameter",
    "@xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe , @xmath16 ) holds for time - reversal invariance and rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian h_mn = h_nm = h^_nm  . when time - reversal invariance is violated and h_mn=[h^]_mn  , one obtains the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue , @xmath17 ) .",
    "the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse , @xmath18 ) is in correspondence with time - reversal invariance but broken rotational symmetry of the hamiltonian h^(0)_nm_2 - i _ = 1 ^ 3 h^()_nm _  , with @xmath19 real and symmetric and @xmath20 real and antisymmetric",
    ".    the functional form of the distribution @xmath21 of the neighbor spacings @xmath22 between consecutive eigenvalues for the gaussian ensembles can be approximated by p__d(s ) = a__d s^_d ( -b__d s^2 )  , which is known as the wigner surmise and reads for example in the case @xmath23 ( gue ) p(s ) = s^2 ( - s^2 )  .",
    "if the eigenvalues of a system are completely uncorrelated one ends up with a poisson distribution for their neighbor spacings p(s ) =  .",
    "an interpolating function between the poisson and the wigner distribution is given by the brody distribution  @xcite reading for the goe case [ brodydist ] p(s , ) = ( + 1 ) s^ ( - s^+ 1 )  , = ^+1 ( )  , 0 1  .",
    "so far the mathematical relationship between classically chaotic systems and their eigenvalues after quantization .",
    "remarkably , the wigner distribution could be observed in a number of systems by physical experiments and computer simulations evading the whole quantum world  @xcite .      an impressive manifestation of the wigner surmise came from nuclear physics  @xcite .    the histogram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the distribution of spacings of nuclear levels versus the variable @xmath22 , the actual spacing in units of the mean level spacing @xmath24 .",
    "the data set comprises 1726 spacings of levels of the same spin and parity from a number of different nuclei .",
    "these data were obtained from neutron time - of - flight spectroscopy and from high - resolution proton scattering . the similarity to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is striking .",
    "rydberg levels of the hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field have a spacing distribution which once again agrees with rmt , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  @xcite .",
    "the levels are taken from the vicinity of the scaled binding energy @xmath25 .",
    "solid and dashed lines are fits , except for the bottom figure which represents the goe .",
    "additionally , a transition from poisson to goe behavior with increasing field strength is clearly visible here .",
    "the conventional way to describe the localization transition is to use the anderson hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the electron creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath29 , subscript @xmath30 denotes adjacent to @xmath29 , and @xmath31 is the random energy of site @xmath29 in units of the overlap energy of adjacent sites and is uniformly distributed in the range from @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the eigenstates of the anderson hamiltonian in the vicinity of the energy @xmath33 experience a localization transition with increasing @xmath34 . for a simple cubic lattice ,",
    "the `` metal - insulator '' transition occurs at @xmath35 and exhibits a crossover from wigner to poisson behavior , see fig .",
    "we remark that the anderson model together with the hubbard model serve also as fundamental theories for high - temperature super - conductivity .",
    "the lagrangian density of the su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) system is given by @xmath36 where the minimal coupling @xmath37 of the scalar field @xmath38 to the gauge field @xmath39 and the field strength tensor @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , generators of the su(2 ) algebra .",
    "the potential of the scalar field ( the higgs field ) is @xmath45 this work is in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional minkowski space ( @xmath46 ) and chooses spatially homogeneous yang - mills and higgs fields  @xcite .    when @xmath47 the potential @xmath48 has a minimum at @xmath49 , but for @xmath50 the minimum is at |_0|==v  , which is the non - zero higgs vacuum .",
    "this vacuum is degenerate and after spontaneous symmetry breaking the physical vacuum can be chosen @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath52 , @xmath53 and the other components of the yang - mills fields are zero , in the higgs vacuum the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "here @xmath57 is the mass term of the yang - mills fields .",
    "this ymh hamiltonian is a toy model for classical non - linear dynamics , exhibiting a classical chaos - order transition . to outline its connection to the quantal fluctuations of the energy levels , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the @xmath21 distribution for different values of the parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the figure shows a wigner - poisson transition by increasing the value @xmath58 of the higgs field in the vacuum . by using the @xmath21 distribution and the brody function it is possible to give a quantitative measure of the degree of quantal chaoticity of the system . in this",
