    "@xmath1-decay is the every - day reflection of weak - interaction in nuclei . as such",
    ", it provides an experimental window to the properties of the weak interaction at nuclear density .",
    "in particular , theoretical studies of @xmath1-decay rates of nuclei have argued for a suppression of the axial coupling constant @xmath3 , from its vacuum value , as extracted from the lifetime of the neutron @xmath4 @xcite , to unity , i.e. @xmath5 @xcite . according to a recent study , this suppression occurs gradually , as the mass of the nucleus grows , and fully utilized for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the ramifications of this suppression are numerous .",
    "for example , to the understanding of astrophysical phenomena , such as neutron - star cooling and core collapse supernovae , whose dynamics is controlled by the weak interactions .",
    "it is of no surprise that the source of this suppression has been the target of many theoretical works , which have associated it with a partial restoration of chiral symmetry in finite densities , deficiencies in the inclusion of correlations between nucleons , loop - corrections to the axial current originating in nucleonic excitations and mesonic currents , or combination of the three @xcite .",
    "an important assumption is hidden in these suppression mechanism : if a full calculation of the weak interaction inside nuclei was possible from first principles , then the calculated decay - rates should agree with the experimental ones .",
    "that is , if one could describe correctly the correlations between nucleons , and the weak interaction of an external probe with a nucleus , then one should recover the physical value of the axial constant . in order to do that , pertinent",
    "is to solve the nuclear problem from first - principles . due to the strong correlations involved in the problem ,",
    "a calculation of nuclear wave functions from the nucleonic degrees of freedom is at reach only for very light nuclei .    the lightest nucleus that undergoes a @xmath1-decay is the triton .",
    "however , the theory can not be checked in the triton since its half - life is used to remove some freedom in the weak interaction of a lepton with a nucleus , as will be explained explictly later .",
    "the lightest nucleus that can provide a test to the theory is thus @xmath0he .",
    "@xmath0he ( @xmath7 ) is an unstable nucleus , which undergoes a @xmath1 decay with a half - life @xmath8 to the ground state of @xmath0li ( @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , a microscopic calculation of @xmath0he from its nucleonic degrees of freedom , failed to reproduce the @xmath1-decay rate .",
    "this study , accomplished by schiavilla and wiringa @xcite , has used the realistic argonne @xmath10 ( av18 ) nucleon - nucleon potential , combined with the urbana - ix ( uix ) three - nucleon - force ( 3nf ) , to derive the nuclear wave functions , through the variational monte - carlo approach . the model used for the nuclear weak axial current includes one- and two - body operators .",
    "the two - body currents are phenomenological , with the strength of the leading two - body term  associated with @xmath11-isobar excitation of the nucleon  adjusted to reproduce the gamow - teller matrix element in tritium @xmath1-decay . the calculated half - life of @xmath0he overpredicts the measured one by about 9%",
    ". an unexpected result of the calculation , was that two - body currents lead to a @xmath12 increase in the value of the gamow - teller matrix element of @xmath0he , thus worsening the comparison with experiment .",
    "the authors of this paper have presumed that the origin of this discrepancy is either in the approximate character of the vmc wave functions , or in the discrepancies of the nuclear model of the weak interaction .",
    "pervin _ et _",
    "@xcite , have used the gfmc approach to evolve the vmc wave functions ansatz .",
    "they showed that this brings the single nucleon gamow - teller matrix element to about 0 - 3% deviation from the experimental value .",
    "however , the mec are still expected to increase the deviation from the experiment to about 2 - 5% from the experimental value , leaving this problem intact . in the current",
    "_ paper _ , we argue that the origin of the discrepancy is indeed in the model of the weak interaction inside the nucleus .",
    "the foundation of such an argument has to be in the underlying theory , i.e. quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "thus , we describe the weak currents within the nucleus , using an effective theory of qcd , namely chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath13pt ) , applicable at low energies , relevant to @xmath1-decay processes @xcite .",
    "we use the triton @xmath1-decay to calibrate the strength of the contact interaction part of the meson - exchange currents , thus the calculation is without any free - parameters .",
    "the six - body nuclear problem is solved in a fully _ ab - initio _ approach , expanded in hyperspherical - harmonics function , from its nucleonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the nuclear wave functions are derived from j - matrix inverse scattering nucleon - nucleon potential ( jisp ) , describing two - nucleon scattering data and bound and resonant states of light nuclei to high accuracy @xcite . using this approach not only brings the calculated @xmath1-decay rate to within @xmath2 of the measured data , but also changes qualitatively the contribution of the two - body meson exchange currents ( mec ) compared to the work of schiavilla and wiringa .",
    "@xmath13pt based mec are found to decrease the gamow - teller matrix element , compared with the increase found by schiavilla and wiringa .",
    "we argue that this qualitatively different behavior originates in the use of @xmath13pt based mec , rather than the specific choice of the potential .",
    "we start with a brief reminder of @xmath1-decay process , and the formalism used in the calculation .",
    "the decay is a weak process , in which an unstable nucleus of charge @xmath14 emits an electron and anti - electron - neutrino , leaving a nucleus of charge @xmath15 .",
    "the interaction is mediated through the exchange of heavy w@xmath16 boson .",
    "as the momentum transfer in the process is much smaller than the mass of the @xmath17 boson , the weak interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fermi coupling constant @xcite , @xmath20 is the ckm matrix element mixing @xmath21 and @xmath22 quarks involved in the process @xcite , @xmath23 is the lepton charge lowering current , and @xmath24 is the nuclear charge raising current .",
    "the decay rate can be calculated using fermi s golden rule , and it is proportional to the squared matrix element of this weak hamiltonian @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the initial ( final ) state .",
    "the lepton current is well - approximated as a current of charged dirac particles , thus results in kinematical factors to the decay - rate .",
    "the weak nuclear current can be written as : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a pauli matrix .",
    "@xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) has a polar- ( axial- ) vector symmetry . here",
    ", we will discuss either a triton decay , or @xmath0he decay , hence the transitions are constrained by a selection rule on the angular - momentum change in the transition : @xmath32 .",
    "thus , a multipole decomposition of the nuclear current is helpful . due to the small momentum - transfer",
    "only the lowest multipoles contribute , i.e. the @xmath33 electric multipole of axial - vector symmetry @xmath34 , and in the case of triton also the @xmath35 coulomb multipole of polar - vector symmetry @xmath36 .",
    "we explicitly checked that indeed the contribution of neglected multipoles to the decay - rate of @xmath0he can be bounded by @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the leading order contribution to the @xmath34 and @xmath36 operators are proportional to the gamow - teller and fermi operators , respectively .",
    "thus , it is customary , when discussing the experimental rates , to talk about the empirical fermi and gamow - teller matrix elements , instead of @xmath34 and @xmath36 , using the relations @xmath38 and @xmath39    here , @xmath40 , and similarly for @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the total angular momentum of the initial nucleus , and @xmath43 is the axial constant  @xcite .    as discussed by simpson  @xcite , and later revisited by schiavilla _",
    "et al_.  @xcite , the `` comparative '' half - life is related to the ",
    "empirical \" gt and f operators thorough @xmath44 here , @xmath45 ( such that @xmath46 ) , and @xmath47  @xcite accounts for the small difference in the statistical rate function between vector and axial - vector transitions . putting the measured @xmath0he comparative half - life @xmath48 @xcite , one extracts @xmath49 . for triton , @xmath50 @xcite , thus @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite . ]    in order to complete a calculation , we have to specify the detailed structure of the weak - current , and to calculate the nuclear wave functions",
    ". these will combine to produce the theoretical @xmath34 , which will be compared to the experimental ones above .",
    "the main difference between the current work and previous ones , is the physical origin of the currents .",
    "the last two decades of theoretical developments have provided us with an effective theory of qcd , in the form of @xmath13pt @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13pt lagrangian is constructed by integrating out qcd degrees of freedom of the order of @xmath52 and higher .",
    "it retains all assumed symmetry principles , particularly the approximate chiral symmetry of the underlying theory .",
    "this su(2)@xmath53su(2)@xmath54 symmetry is based on the small up- and down - quarks masses ( compared to the qcd breaking scale ) .",
    "the lack of parity doublets in the qcd scale is interpreted as an indication that this symmetry is spontaneously broken , with the pions as the goldstone - nambu bosons .",
    "their finite , albeit small , mass is due to the finite quark masses , explicitly breaking the chiral symmetry .    furthermore , the chiral lagrangian can be organized in terms of a perturbative expansion in positive powers of @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the generic momentum in the nuclear process , i.e. the @xmath1-decay or the pion mass  @xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry dictates the operator structure of each term of the effective lagrangian , however not the coupling constants . a theoretical evaluation of these coefficients , or low - energy constants ( lecs ) , is equivalent to solving qcd at low - energy , and it is not yet feasible to obtain them from lattice calculations because of computational limitations .",
    "alternatively , these undetermined constants can be constrained by low - energy experiments .",
    "as the chiral symmetry is a gauging of the electro - weak interaction , the weak currents are the nther currents of this symmetry .",
    "the weak axial current adopted in this work is the nther current derived from the axial symmetry of the chiral lagrangian up to n@xmath57lo  @xcite . at leading order ( lo )",
    "this current consists of the standard single - nucleon part , which , as mentioned above , at low momentum transfer is proportional to the gamow - teller ( gt ) operator , @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 are spin and isospin - raising operators of the @xmath26th nucleon .    corrections to the single - nucleon current appear at n@xmath61lo in the form of relativistic terms .",
    "it is easily verified @xcite that the single nucleon current achieved in the @xmath13pt formalism , is identical to that achieved in the standard nuclear physics approach ( snpa ) .    at n@xmath57lo",
    ", additional corrections appear in the form of axial mec . while the relativistic corrections are negligible for the half life , the mec have a substantial influence on this @xmath1-decay rate .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that @xmath34 is a chirally unprotected operator @xcite .",
    "the mec , to this order , include two topologies : a one-(charged)-pion exchange , and a contact term ( that represents , for example , two - pion exchange or the exchange of heavier mesons ) . in configuration space the one - pion exchange part of the axial mec is given by : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the pion - decay constant , @xmath64 is the mass of the nucleon , @xmath65 is the charged - pion mass @xcite , and the low - energy constants @xmath66 and @xmath67 are calibrated in the @xmath68-n sector @xcite .",
    "the operators used here are defined as , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , the yukawa - like functions are : @xmath71 @xmath72 is a cutoff function , which we take as a gaussian .",
    "apart from this , the mec include a contact term , that has the form : @xmath73 where the `` smeared '' delta function is @xmath74 the lec @xmath75 is the only lec up to n@xmath57lo that can not be calibrated in the single nucleon sector , as it originates in the contact interaction @xmath68-nn in the chiral lagrangian . as a result , in order to determine @xmath75 , one has to resort to a larger nuclear system .",
    "we will use the triton half - life as an experimental datum to determine this lec , sec .",
    "[ subsec:3h3he ] .",
    "the difference between the one - body contribution to the @xmath0he-@xmath0li gt matrix element and the experimental value is of the order of few percent . a result which on the one hand is very satisfying , but on the other hand implies that numerical accuracy at a _ per mil _ level is required if we to regard the @xmath0he @xmath1-decay as a test of the mec model . in view of this required level of convergence",
    "we use the jisp16 potential @xcite to model the interaction between the nucleons .",
    "the jisp16 nn potential utilizes the j - matrix inverse scattering technique to construct a soft nuclear potential , formulated in the harmonic oscillator basis , that by construction reproduces the nn phase shifts up to pion threshold and the binding energies of the light nuclei with @xmath76 .",
    "we use the hyperspherical - harmonics ( hh ) expansion to solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "the hh functions constitute a general basis for expanding the wave functions of an @xmath77-body system  @xcite . in the hh method ,",
    "the translational invariant wave - function is written as @xmath78 } c_{n[k]}r_{n}(\\rho){\\cal y}_{[k]}(\\omega , s_i , t_i)\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the hyperradius , and @xmath80 are a complete set of basis functions .",

    "the hyperradius @xmath79 is symmetric under particle permutations since @xmath84 .",
    "the functions @xmath83}(\\omega , s_i , t_i)$ ] are characterized by a set of quantum numbers @xmath85 $ ] @xcite and possess definite angular momentum , isospin , and parity quantum numbers .",
    "they are the eigenfunctions of the hyperspherical , or generalized angular momentum operator @xmath86 , @xmath87}(\\omega , s_i , t_i)=k(k+3a-5){\\cal    y}_{[k]}(\\omega , s_i , t_i)$ ] .",
    "the details of our method are explained thoroughly in ref .",
    "our results for the ground state properties of the @xmath88 nuclei , @xmath57h and @xmath57he , are presented in table [ taba3 ] . in the table , we present the energies , matter radii , and the leading order gt matrix element ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1a_gt_lo ] ) ) as a function of @xmath89 , the limiting value of the hyperspherical angular momentum @xmath90 in the hh expansion .",
    "as we are using the bare interaction our results are variational .",

    "@xmath91h binding energies , rms matter radius , and the leading order gt matrix element as a function of @xmath89 . [ taba3 ] [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     summarizing , the predicted gt of @xmath0he is : @xmath92 the first error is the cutoff variation dependence , the second is numerical , the third is due to uncertainties in the triton half - life , and the last is due to uncertainties in @xmath3 .",
    "this should be compared to the experimental matrix - element @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the theory overpredicts gt by about @xmath12 .",
    "the use of phenomenologically based potential , jisp , combined with a @xmath13pt based mec , is an inconsistency inherent to our calculation .",
    "clearly , the chiral lagrangian can be used to derive the nuclear forces as well .",
    "this inconsistency , however , allows us to overcome limited computational resources , as well as theoretical difficulties ( the n@xmath57lo nuclear potential has not been fully developed yet ) , and to accomplish the task of a microscopic calculation of a six - body problem .",
    "the use of a hybrid approach , sometimes coined eft@xmath94 , has had great success in the literature @xcite . in all these checks ,",
    "the phenomenological nuclear forces included realistic potentials , the av18+uix force model .",
    "this potential , though different than the @xmath13pt force models in the short - range character of the force , has the correct long - range behavior , due to the pion exchange .",
    "the jisp potential , however , is different in this respect , as it is built in an _ ab - exitu _ approach , and does not have an asymptotic long pion behavior , thus not consistent with chiral symmetry even at long - distances .",
    "in addition , the jisp potential does not include a three - body force .",
    "it is hard to estimate the effect of these approximations .",
    "however , in a recent work @xcite , the triton @xmath1-decay process was calculated using force model and current derived consistently from the same @xmath13pt n@xmath57lo lagrangian .",
    "one of the conclusions of this work has been that the short - range correlations of the force and the short - range correlations of the weak current are not correlated , thus the effect of the three - body - force is negligible for gt - type operators .",
    "in addition , the jisp potential successfully reproduces nucleon - nucleon scattering data , and the binding energies of @xmath95 mass nuclei .",
    "however , the most convincing reason to believe the stability of the current results , is the minimal dependence of the half - life in the cutoff .",
    "we thus believe that even in the current calculation , the effect of the approximation will not change qualitatively the results , and the effect of the mec .",
    "the qualitative difference originates in the different structure of the snpa and @xmath13pt based mec .",
    "a careful analysis of the difference between the mec originating in @xmath13pt and those used in snpa , has been accomplished by park _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "they have shown that one - pion exchange term exists in both models . of particular importance is the part of this term in the snpa based mec that represents the exchange of a pion due to a delta excitation of the nucleon , which is found to correspond roughly to the @xmath96 term in the @xmath13pt based mec .",
    "the coupling constant of this term @xmath97 has been fixed by schiavilla and wiringa @xcite , so that the theory would reproduce the triton half - life .",
    "however , differences between the approaches arise in their short range character . in the snpa approach , these correspond to the exchange of a @xmath79-meson",
    ". such a term does not exist in the @xmath13pt approach as it arises only at n@xmath98lo @xcite .",
    "moreover , a contact interaction of the form of eq .  ( [ eq : contact ] ) does not appear in the snpa approach .",
    "it is this contact interaction that creates the qualitative difference between the current work and that of schiavilla and wiringa @xcite .    in order to acknowledge that , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : relative_importance ] the relative contribution of each the terms , i.e. one - body , one - pion - exchange and full calculation , to the gt matrix element .",
    "one first recognizes that the one - pion contribution to the matrix element has a positive sign in both @xmath57h and @xmath0he , and that the contact interaction has a negative contribution to the matrix element . in the case of @xmath57h",
    "this is only a partial cancellation , as it is calibrated to increase the 1-body matrix element and to bring the calculation into the experimental value . in view of the fact that the one - body calculation in the case of the jisp potential almost exhausts the total gt strength",
    ", one might suggest that the negative sign of the contact interaction , as well as the partial cancellation is an artifact of the potential .",
    "however , the same partial cancellation is found also in a consistent n@xmath57lo calculation of @xmath57h decay , thus it is not a result of the use of the jisp potential @xcite .",
    "in contrast to @xmath57h , when examining the case of @xmath0he , one observes that the negative contribution of the contact term is bigger ( in absolute value ) than the one - pion - exchange contribution , thus leading to a total negative contribution of the mec .",
    "this negative contribution is needed as the single - nucleon gt is bigger than the experimental gt .",
    "recalling the fact that the snpa approach does not contain a contact interaction , we understand the origin of the positive contribution of the mec in that approach , which increases the difference between the calculated and measured decay - rates .",
    "in this work we have used the @xmath0he @xmath1-decay as a testing ground for the nuclear weak - current derived from @xmath13pt . a precondition for such",
    "a task is an accurate evaluation of the @xmath0he-@xmath0li weak transition matrix - element at the per mil level . to this end",
    "we have used the soft nn potential jisp16 to describe the nuclear dynamics and the hh expansion method to solve the schrdinger equation . the weak interaction in the nucleus is completely determined by fixing the short range behavior of the scattering operator to reproduce the experimental @xmath57h half - life , resulting in a parameter - free prediction of the @xmath0he @xmath1-decay rate .",
    "we have found that at the 1-body , impulse approximation , level the @xmath99he-@xmath99li gt matrix - element is over predicted by roughly @xmath2 .",
    "this observation for the jisp16 potential is in agreement with previous findings for other potential models .",
    "adding 2-body , meson - exchange , currents derived within @xmath13pt , we have found that in contrast with the previous work of schiavilla and wiringa @xcite , the 2-body mec contribution to the @xmath99he-@xmath99li transition matrix element is negative .",
    "we argue that this difference originates in the different short - range character of the mec derived in the two approaches .",
    "we find that both for @xmath57h and @xmath0he , there is a sign difference between the positive contribution of the long - range one - pion - exchange current , and the negative contribution of the contact interaction in @xmath13pt , representing higher degrees of freedom which were integrated out in the development of the effective theory . in the case of the 6-body transition",
    ", however , the contact interaction has a bigger value than the one - pion exchange contribution .",
    "thus , it provides the origin to the sign difference between the mec contribution in @xmath57h and @xmath0he .",
    "this contact interaction does not exist in the standard nuclear physics approach , adopted by schiavilla and wiringa .",
    "therefore , the reconciliation between the theoretical and the experimental @xmath99he half - life is due to the use of the @xmath13pt formalism .",
    "our calculation points to an agreement at the level of about 1.7% between the measured and calculated gt matrix elements .",
    "this result should be contrasted with the difference of 5.4% obtained by schiavilla _ et _",
    "more importantly , it shows that dominant contributions that arise naturally in the @xmath13pt formalism , and do not appear in the standard nuclear physics approach , are essential to a successful prediction of this weak observable . in order to pin - point",
    "this argument , a use of a consistent approach , in which both the weak currents and the nuclear forces are derived from the same microscopic theory , is called for .",
    "the agreement between the calculated and measured decay rates of @xmath0he indicates that there is no signature in this observable for an additional suppression of the axial constant .",
    "it appears that all the needed suppression originates in correlations between nucleons in the nucleus , revealing itself in the form of exchange currents .",
