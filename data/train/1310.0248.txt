    "one of the principal difficulties underlying quantum statistical mechanics is the noncommutative nature of the relevant observables .",
    "for some systems , the said difficulty can sometimes be reduced by developing a suitable classical , and often probabilistic , representation of the problem at hand .",
    "interestingly , this can be done for quite a few examples of interest , namely , the quantum rotator , the quantum heisenberg model , the ising model in a transversal field and , most notably , the bose gas .",
    "the classical representation is still hard to analyze , but some results often follow .",
    "see tth @xcite and aizenman and nachtergaele @xcite for early studies of such representations .    in this paper",
    "we take up a model that is derived from the classical representation of interacting bose gas .",
    "this representation is originally due to feynman @xcite to whom it served as a mathematical tool for the analysis of the onset of bose ",

    "the probability measure @xmath15 is over collections of independent brownian bridges @xmath16 , where the @xmath17th bridge starts at @xmath18 and terminates at @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath20 is the two - body interaction potential between the bosons .",
    "the a priori measure on the positions @xmath21 is lebesgue over a finite set ; integrating the weight ( [ fkrep ] ) defines the normalizing constant called the partition function .",
    "a natural first case to explore is that of no interaction , that is , @xmath22 .",
    "averaging the positions over , say , a torus can then be exactly carried out with the help of fourier representation and the sum over permutations can then also be performed .",
    "an outcome of this , envisioned already by feynman @xcite , is as follows : for @xmath23 , any finite density of particles and any @xmath24 , a typical @xmath25 will decompose entirely into finite cycles ( i.e. , of sizes not growing with @xmath8 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath26 and each @xmath24",
    "there is a critical density above which a particle is contained in a cycle of length of order @xmath8 with positive probability . a mathematical proof of this has been given only recently by st @xcite ; the critical density turns out to coincide with that for the appearance of the bose ",
    "einstein condensate .",
    "it has subsequently been observed by betz and ueltschi @xcite that a similar calculation to the one just mentioned can be carried out for @xmath27 replaced by more general potential functions .",
    "the principal next challenge from the mathematics point of view is thus to either allow for nonzero interactions , @xmath28 , or to drop the integration over the positions @xmath18 .",
    "the former choice is that of the prime interest for physics ; unfortunately , at this moment we do not see any tangible way to tackle it .",
    "the latter option is nonetheless interesting as well ; it leads to natural measures on partitions of point sets in @xmath29 .",
    "this motivation was the basis of an earlier article of fichtner @xcite .",
    "more recently , gandolfo , ruiz and ueltschi @xcite and betz and ueltschi @xcite proposed a similar model with the particles placed at the vertices of the integer lattice @xmath30 .      we will henceforth focus on the latter case and formalize it as the following problem : for a given locally - finite set @xmath31 of positions and a potential function @xmath32 , we wish to consider a probability measure @xmath33 that is formally given by @xmath34 if @xmath2 is finite , this corresponds to the measure arising from ( [ fkrep ] ) with @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath2 is infinite , the expression ( [ formalmeasure ] ) is generally ill defined . in order to extend it to infinite volume ( i.e. , infinite number of particles ) , one either has to appeal to limits  an approach previously used in this context by fichtner @xcite and gandolfo , ruiz and ueltschi @xcite  or go directly by prescribing infinite - volume gibbs measures via a family of specifications ( georgii @xcite ) .",
    "this will be our choice , so the first question to ask is :    can we define a consistent family of specifications of the form ( [ formalmeasure ] ) ?    as we will see later , already this represents a departure from the standard theory .",
    "naturally , one thus immediately adds :    under what conditions are there ( infinite - volume ) gibbs measures for the specifications defined in ( 1 ) ?    in an approach via limits from finite volume , this boils down to controlling tightness  the issue is that in the limiting measure , no points get mapped to / from infinity .",
    "this has , so far , only been accomplished under the assumption of low density / high temperature ( cf . conditions ( v.3 ) or ( 5.8 ) in fichtner @xcite ) or for interaction with a finite - range cutoff ( betz and ueltschi @xcite , page 478 ) . in addition , all of this is only for the free boundary condition ( fichtner @xcite , theorems  2.2 and  3.1 ) .",
    "when this manuscript was very near its completion , betz @xcite posted a proof of tightness for the measures with periodic boundary conditions over @xmath36 in all @xmath37 assuming the summability condition of the kind @xmath38 for some @xmath39 .",
    "once the setting for gibbs theory is fixed , the natural follow - up questions concern the structure of the permutations that are typical samples from these measures :    characterize the gibbs measures that are trivial on the tail sigma field ( i.e. , the extremal gibbbs measures ) .    under what conditions",
    "does @xmath25 contain finite cycles only , and when do infinite cycles occur with positive probability ?",
    "the mathematical results that are available at present all pertain to the regime of low densities / high temperatures : the measure defined by the free boundary condition contains only finite cycles almost surely ( fichtner @xcite , theorem  3.2 ) .",
    "interesting numerical simulations were performed by gandolfo , ruiz and ueltschi @xcite and grosskinsky , lovisolo and ueltschi @xcite of the model with @xmath40 ( the integer lattice ) and @xmath41 . these indicated a similar dichotomy as for the ideal bose gas : only microscopic ( finite ) cycles in dimensions @xmath23 and macroscopic cycles in @xmath42 for @xmath43 sufficiently large .",
    "the principal goal of this paper is to answer the above questions in the case of one - dimensional point sets , @xmath44 , subject to natural homogeneity conditions , and a fairly rich class of potentials @xmath6 .",
    "explicitly , we show how to define gibbs specifications , establish the existence of a family of gibbs measures and prove that the extremal ones are in one - to - one correspondence with an integer parameter called the flow .",
    "this is the quantity whose absolute value gives the ( a.s .- constant ) number of infinite cycles while its sign tells us their asymptotic direction ( it turns out that all infinite cycles necessarily `` flow '' in the same direction ) .",
    "apart from the above mentioned works that are focused on the connection to the bose gas , there are numerous other studies of combinatorial nature that deal with similar problems .",
    "one line of research concerns compositions of random transpositions ( e.g. , schramm @xcite , berestycki and durrett @xcite , berestycki @xcite ) ; these pertain to situations without underlying geometry .",
    "another direction concerns the random stirring process where transpositions `` arrive '' randomly but only over edges of an underlying graph . for the graph being an infinite regular tree ,",
    "progress has recently been made concerning the existence and uniqueness of a transition from a regime without infinite cycles to a regime with infinite cycles ( hammond @xcite ) .",
    "a recent review by golschmidt , ueltschi and windridge @xcite gives further connections between the combinatorial models and quantum systems .",
    "there are also several alternative approaches to statistical mechanics of bose gases to the one proposed by feynman .",
    "recently , much progress has been achieved in the analysis of the so - called gross ",
    "pitaievski limit ; this density - function approach is summarized in the monograph by lieb , seiringer , solovej and yngvason @xcite .",
    "other studies were put forward that expand on the ideas of bogoliubov @xcite ; see , for instance , a review article by zagrebnov and bru @xcite .",
    "the jury is still out on which of these approaches is best suited for understanding the physics , although some connection of the present problem to the others has also been made ; see , for example , ueltschi @xcite and the work of adams , bru and knig @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we define a suitable notion of gibbs measures for a given set of points @xmath2 and potential @xmath6 satisfying suitable assumptions .",
    "we introduce the main concepts for our analysis and formulate a series of lemmas containing our findings for gibbs measures in the given context , concluding with a summarizing theorem .",
    "the following sections contain the proofs for these results .",
    "here we develop the mathematical framework of our problem and give statements of the results .",
    "our approach is based on the theory of gibbs measures but , since we work in a somewhat nonstandard setting , we will be rather pedantic in introducing all necessary notation .",
    "our aim is to construct a measure of form ( [ formalmeasure ] ) on permutations on a given countably - infinite set of points @xmath44 .",
    "one may want to think of a regular point set such as the set of all integers @xmath45 , but at this point we only assume that @xmath2 is :    locally finite ( i.e. , any bounded subset of @xmath2 is finite ) and    bi - infinite ( i.e. , @xmath2 is unbounded from above and below ) .    in order to be able to identify particular points of @xmath2 with respect to a given position",

    "a key fact is that @xmath72 does not depend on @xmath53 :    [ lemsameflow ] for locally finite @xmath2 and @xmath61 , @xmath72 has the same value for all @xmath73 .",

    "similarly we may have cycles going from @xmath84 to @xmath84 , @xmath83 to @xmath83 , @xmath84 to @xmath83 .",
    "if one or both of the above limits do not exist , we say that the infinite cycle is indeterminate .",
    "not too surprisingly , the value of the flow gives some information on the number of such infinite cycles :    [ lemflowcycles ] assume that @xmath2 is locally finite .",
    "any @xmath61 with @xmath85 does not have indeterminate infinite cycles , and it has at least @xmath86 infinite cycles from @xmath83 to @xmath84 if @xmath87 and at least @xmath86 infinite cycles from @xmath84 to @xmath83 if @xmath88 .",
    "we note that this lemma still leaves the possibility of having additional infinite cycles that do not contribute to the flow , for example , an infinite cycle from @xmath84 to @xmath84 or a pair of cycles , one from @xmath83 to @xmath84 and one from @xmath84 to @xmath83 .",
