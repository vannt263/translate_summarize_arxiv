    "intuition tells us that a system displays collective behaviour when all individuals spontaneously do the same thing , whatever this thing may be .",
    "we surely detect collective behaviour when all birds in a flock fly in the same direction and turn at the same time @xcite , as well as when all spins in a magnet align , giving rise to a macroscopic magnetization @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we would not say that there is any collective behaviour going on in a gas , despite the large number of molecules .",
    "the concept of collective behaviour seems therefore closely linked to that of emergent collective order , or synchronization .",
    "indeed , explaining how order spontaneously arises from local inter - individual interactions has been one of the major issues in the field @xcite .",
    "the case of insect swarms is tricky in this respect .",
    "several species in the vast taxonomic order diptera ( flies , mosquitoes , midges ) form big swarms consisting largely of males , whose purpose is to attract females @xcite .",
    "swarming therefore has a key reproductive function and , in some cases , relevant health implications , the obvious , but not unique , example being that of the malaria mosquito , _ anopheles gambiae _ @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that swarms form in proximity of some visual marker , like a water puddle , or a street lamp @xcite .",
    "swarming insects seem to fly independently around the marker , without paying much attention to each other ( see video s1 ) . for this reason , the question of whether swarms behave as truly collective systems",
    "is debated @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has even been suggested that in diptera there is no interaction between individuals within the swarm and therefore no collective behaviour at all @xcite .",
    "although other studies observed local coordination between nearest neighbors @xcite , it remains controversial whether and to what extent collective patterns emerge over the scale of the whole group . clarifying this issue",
    "is a central goal in swarms containment @xcite . in absence of quantitative evidence telling the contrary , the hypothesis that external factors , as the marker , are the sole cause of swarming and that no genuine collective behaviour is present , is by far the simplest explanation .",
    "physics , however , warns us to be careful in identifying collective behaviour with collective order .",
    "there are systems displaying important collective effects both in their ordered _ and _ in their disordered phase .",
    "the most important example is that of a ferromagnet : the collective response to an external perturbation is as strong in the disordered phase slightly above the critical temperature @xmath0 , i.e. the temperature below which a spontaneous magnetization emerges , as it is in the ordered phase slightly below @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , once below the critical temperature , increasing the amount of order _ lowers _ the collective response @xcite .",
    "hence , although certainly one of its most visible manifestations , emergent order is not necessarily the best probe of collective behaviour .",
    "the crucial task for living groups is not simply to achieve an ordered state , but to respond collectively to the environmental stimuli .",
    "for this to happen , correlation must be large , namely individuals must be able to influence each other s behavioural changes on a group scale .",
    "the question then arises of whether correlation in biological systems is a consequence of collective order or whether it can be sustained even in absence of order , as it happens in some physical systems .",
    "the question is relevant because the way individuals in a group synchronize their behavioural fluctuations ( correlation ) is possibly a more general mechanism than the synchronization of behaviour itself ( order ) .",
    "all experimental studies performed up to now , however , concerned highly synchronized groups ( as bird flocks , fish shoals and marching locusts @xcite ) , which displayed both order and correlation .",
    "hence , the question of whether or not order and correlations are two sides of the same phenomenon remained open until now . here",
    ", we try and give an answer to this question by experimentally studying large swarms of insects in the field . as we will show , despite the lack of collective order , we do find strong correlations , indicating that even in biological systems collective behaviour and group - level coordination do not require order to be sustained .",
    "* experiments and tracking .",
    "* we perform an experimental study of swarms of wild midges in the field .",
    "midges are small non - biting flies belonging to the order diptera , suborder nematocera ( diptera : chironomidae and diptera : ceratopogonidae - see methods ) .",
    "the body length of the species we study is in the range @xmath1@xmath2 mm .",
    "swarms are found at sunset , in the urban parks of rome , typically near stagnant water . as noted before @xcite",
    ", we find that swarms form above natural or artificial landmarks .",
    "moving the landmark leads to an overall displacement of the swarm .",
    "the swarms we studied range in size between @xmath3 and @xmath4 individuals ( see table s1 ) .    to reconstruct the @xmath5 trajectories of individual insects we use three synchronized cameras shooting at @xmath6 frames - per - seconds ( trifocal technique - fig.[fig : experiment]e and methods ) .",
    "our apparatus does not perturb the swarms in any way .",
    "the technique is similar to the one we used for starling flocks @xcite , with one notable difference . to reach the desired experimental accuracy we need to know the mutual geometric relations between the three cameras very accurately . in the case of flocks ,",
    "this could be achieved only by an _ a priori _ alignment of the cameras . in the case of swarms , though , we proceed differently . after each swarm acquisition , we pin down the geometry of the camera system by taking multiple images of a calibrated target ( fig.[fig : experiment]f ) .",
    "this procedure is so accurate that the error in the @xmath5 reconstruction is dominated by the image segmentation error due to the pixel resolution .",
    "if we assume this to be equal to @xmath7 pixel ( typically it is smaller than that because midges occupy many pixels ) , we make an error of @xmath8 cm in the determination of the distance between two points @xmath9 cm apart from each other ( a reference value for nearest neighbour distance ) .",
    "the absolute error is the same for more distant points , making the relative precision of our apparatus even higher .",
    "this accuracy makes the determination of the correlation functions we study here very reliable .",
    "the @xmath5-tracking of each midge is performed by using the technique described in @xcite .",
    "sample @xmath5 reconstructions are shown in fig.[fig : experiment]b and in video s1 .",

    "the standard order parameter normally used in collective behaviour is the polarization , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the number of midges in the swarm and @xmath14 is the velocity of insect @xmath15 .",
    "the polarization measures the degree of alignment of the directions of motion ; it is a positive quantity and its maximum value is @xmath7 .",
    "the average polarization over all swarms is quite small , @xmath16 ( see fig.[fig : order ] and table s1 ) . as a reference , in starling flocks we find @xmath17 , on average @xcite .",
    "the probability distributions of the polarization fully confirms the swarms lack of translational order and the stark difference with flocks ( fig.[fig : order ] )",
    ". clearly , swarms are not in a polarized state .",
    "translation is not the only possible collective mode , though .",
    "for example , it is well - known that fish school can produce rotating ( milling ) configurations .",
    "moreover , a group can expand / contract , giving rise to dilatational ( or pulsive ) collective modes .",
    "for this reason we have defined and measured also a rotational and a dilatational order parameter ( see methods ) .",
    "we find , however , that these quantities too have very small values ( fig.[fig : order ] ) .",
    "the time series , on the other hand , show that the order parameters can have rare , but strong fluctuations , during which their value may become significantly larger than that of an uncorrelated system ( fig.[fig : order ] ) .",
    "these large fluctuations are a first hint that nontrivial correlations are present",
    ".    * correlation . * the connected correlation function measures to what extent",
    "the change in behaviour of individual @xmath15 is correlated to that of individual @xmath18 , at distance @xmath19 .",
    "correlation is the most accessible sign of the presence of interaction between the members of a group .",
    "the absence of interaction implies the absence of correlation .",
    "conversely , the presence of correlation implies the presence of an effective interaction ( see supporting information , section i ) .",
    "correlation can be measured for different quantities , but in the case of midges , as with birds and other moving animals , the principal quantity of interest is the direction of moti to compute the connected correlation we first need to introduce the velocity fluctuations , namely the individual velocity subtracted of the overall motion of the group , @xmath20 ( see methods for the detailed definition of @xmath21 ) .",
    "this fluctuation is a dimensional quantity , hence it is unsuitable to compare the correlation in natural vs numerical systems , as we shall do later on .",
    "we therefore introduce the dimensionless velocity fluctuation , @xmath22 the connected correlation function is then given by , @xmath23 where @xmath24 if @xmath25 and zero otherwise , and @xmath26 is the space binning factor .",
    "the form of @xmath27 in natural swarms is reported in fig.[fig : main ] : at short distances there is strong positive correlation , indicating that midges tend to align their velocity fluctuations to that of their neighbours .",
    "after some negative correlation at intermediate distances , @xmath27 relaxes to no correlation for large distances .",
    "this qualitative form is quite typical of all species analyzed ( see fig.[fig : main ] ) .",
    "the smallest value of the distance where @xmath27 crosses zero is the correlation length , @xmath28 , that is an estimate of the length scale over which the velocity fluctuations are correlated @xcite .",
    "the average value of this correlation length over all analyzed swarms is , @xmath29 m .",
    "this value is about @xmath30 times larger than the nearest neighbours distance , whose average over all swarms is , @xmath31 m ( see fig.[fig : main ] and table s1 ) .",
    "previous works noticed the existence of pairing maneuvers and flight - path coordination between nearest neighbours insects @xcite .",
    "our results , however , indicate that midges within a natural swarm influence each other s motion far beyond their nearest neighbours",
    ".    * susceptibility . *",
    "the collective response of the swarm depends crucially on two factors : how distant in space the behavioural change of one insect affects that of another insect ( spatial span of the correlation ) and how strong this effect is ( intensity of the correlation ) . to combine these two factors in one single observable we calculate the cumulative correlation up to scale @xmath19 , @xmath32 it can be shown ( see si - ii ) that this dimensionless function is related to the space integral of the correlation function @xmath27",
    "hence , @xmath33 reaches a maximum where @xmath27 vanishes , i.e. for @xmath34 ( see fig.[fig : main ] ) .",
    "this maximum , @xmath35 , is a measure of the total amount of correlation present in the system .",
    "in statistical physics @xmath36 is exactly equal to the _ susceptibility _ , namely the response of the system to an external perturbation @xcite . in collective animal behaviour",
    ", we do not have a quantitative link between integrated correlation and response , so that calling @xmath36 susceptibility is not strictly correct . however ,",
    "if the probability distribution of the velocities is stationary , we can follow a maximum entropy approach @xcite and still find that the total amount of correlation in the system , @xmath36 , is related to the way the group responds collectively to a perturbation ( see si - ii ) .",
    "the value of @xmath36 for midges swarms is reported in fig.[fig : main ]",
    ".    * noninteracting swarm .",
    "* in order to judge how significant is the correlation function @xmath27 and how large is the susceptibility @xmath36 in natural swarms , we need an effective zero for these quantities , i.e. some null hypothesis baseline . as we have seen in the introduction ,",
    "the minimal assumption is that all individuals in the swarm interact with an external landmark independently from each other .",
    "following okubo @xcite ( but see also @xcite and @xcite ) , we therefore simulate a ` swarm ' of noninteracting particles performing a random walk in a three - dimensional harmonic potential ( see methods ) . visually , the group behaviour of this noninteracting harmonic swarm ( nhs ) looks remarkably similar to that of a real swarm ( see video s2 and s3 ) : all ` midges ' fly around the marker and the group lacks collective order .",
    "this similarity , however , is deceptive . in the nhs",
    ", the correlation function @xmath27 simply fluctuates around zero , with no spatial span , nor structure ( fig.[fig : main ] ) .",
    "moreover , the susceptibility in the nhs is extremely small , @xmath37 , whereas the susceptibility in natural swarms is up to @xmath3 times larger than this non - interacting benchmark ( fig.[fig : main ] ) .",
    "we conclude that swarming behaviour is _ not _ the mere epiphenomenon of the independent response of each insect with the marker . despite the lack of collective order , natural swarms",
    "are strongly correlated on large length scales .",
    "there are big clusters of midges that move coherently , contributing to the ` dancing ' visual effect of the swarm .",

    "interestingly , we find that @xmath36 increases when the average nearest neighbour distance , @xmath38 , decreases ( fig.[fig : chi ] ) .",
    "denser swarms are more correlated than sparser ones .",
    "this result indicates that midges interact through a metric perceptive apparatus : the strength of the perception decreases with the distance , so that when midges are further apart from each other ( larger @xmath38 ) the interaction is weaker and the susceptibility @xmath36 is lower .",
    "this is at variance with what happens in bird flocks : birds interact with a fixed number of neighbours , irrespective of their nearest neighbour distance @xmath38 @xcite ; such kind of topological interaction does not depend on the group density , hence the susceptibility does not depend on the nearest neighbour distance .",
    "figure [ fig : chi ] , on the other hand , shows that midges interact metrically , namely with all neighbours within a fixed metric range , @xmath43 .",
    "hence , in swarms the number of interacting neighbours increases with decreasing @xmath38 ( increasing density ) , and as a consequence of this increased amount interaction , the system becomes also more correlated .    in a system ruled by metric interaction",
    "we expect all lengths to be measured in units of the perception range , @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that the natural variable for the susceptibility is the rescaled nearest neighbour distance , @xmath44 .",
    "the problem is that we are considering different species of midges , likely to have different metric perception ranges .",
    "the simplest hypothesis we can make is that @xmath43 is proportional to the insect body length @xmath42 ( which we can measure ) , so that @xmath45 .",
    "this hypothesis is confirmed by the data : the susceptibility is significantly more correlated to the variable @xmath41 ( p - value @xmath46 ) than to @xmath38 ( p - value @xmath47 ) .",
    "the fact that the natural variable is @xmath41 is a further indication that the interaction in swarms is based on a metric mechanism .",
    "the difference in the nature of the interaction between flocking birds and swarming midges ( topological vs. metric ) is possibly due to the significant differences between vertebrates and arthropods .",
    "topological interaction , namely tracking a fixed number of neighbours irrespective of their distance , requires a level of cognitive elaboration of the information @xcite more sophisticated than a metric interaction , where the decay of the effective force is merely ruled by the physical attenuation of the signal with increasing metric distance .",
    "in other words , within a metric mechanism the range of the interaction is fixed by a perceptive cut - off , rather than a cognitive one .",
    "metric interaction is known to be more fragile than topological one against external perturbations @xcite , and indeed it is far more likely to observe the dispersion of a swarm in the field than that of a flock .",
    "this may be the reason why the presence of an external marker is crucial for the swarming behaviour of midges @xcite .",
    "* correlation without order . *",
    "the experimental observations of a notrivial connected correlation and of a large susceptibility indicate that midges are effectively interacting with each other by acting on their directions of motion .",
    "this does not exclude , of course , that other types of interaction are present .",
    "first of all , the empirical observation that the swarm uses a visual marker as a reference for maintaining its mean spatial position , strongly suggests that each individual interacts with the marker . besides , it is certainly possible that effective positional attraction - repulsion forces between midges , as those described in @xcite , exist .",
    "however , the directional correlations indicate that insects are _ also _ effectively interacting by adjusting their velocities .",
    "moreover , the fact that these correlations are positive for short distances means that midges tend to _ align _ their direction of motion .",
    "this fact may seem surprising , because alignment interactions typically lead to the formation of ordered ( polarized ) groups , which is clearly not the case for midges .",
    "swarms are disordered , and yet interacting and highly correlated systems .",
    "is this a paradox ?",
    "in fact , it is not .",
    "an alignment interaction does not _ per se _ lead to global order in the group . in all models where imitation of the neighbours is present , the onset of long - range order depends on the value of some key tuning parameter . in a ferromagnet , this parameter is the temperature @xmath48 , namely the amount of noise affecting the interaction between the neighbouring spins . at high temperature",
    "the system is in a disordered state , whereas by lowering @xmath48 one reaches a critical temperature below which an ordering transition occurs . in models of active matter",
    "there is another parameter tuning the transition between disorder and order , that is density or , equivalently , nearest neighbour distance : the system gets ordered once the nearest neighbour distance falls below some transition value .",
    "the crucial point is that , in general , the correlation of the system tends to be very large _ around _ the transition point , irrespective of whether the system is in the ordered or in the disordered phase .",
    "hence , even a disordered system can display large correlations , provided that it is not too far from an ordering transition . in",
    "what follows , we want to show that this is indeed what happens with midge swarms .    * vicsek model . * the simplest model based on alignment interaction that predicts an order - disorder transition on changing the density is the vicsek model of collective motion @xcite . in this model",
    "each individual tends to align its direction of motion to that of the neighbours within a _ metric _ perception range , @xmath43 .",
    "the rescaled nearest neighbour distance , @xmath49 , is the control parameter : for low noise , the model predicts a transition from a disordered phase ( low polarization ) at high values of @xmath50 ( low density ) , to an ordered phase ( large polarization ) at low values of @xmath50 ( high density ) @xcite .",
    "we numerically study the vicsek model in three dimensions .",
    "as we have seen , real swarms hold their average position with respect to a marker ; to reproduce this behavioural trait we introduce an harmonic attraction force that each individual experiences towards the origin ( see methods ) . also in central potential the model displays an ordering transition : at large density , for @xmath51 the system is ordered and it has large polarization ( video xxxx ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the polarization is low in the disordered phase , @xmath52 ( fig.[fig : vicsek ] ) .",
    "however , the correlation function is nontrivial when @xmath50 is sufficiently close to @xmath53 ( fig.[fig : vicsek ] ) , indicating the existence of large clusters of correlated individuals , which can be clearly detected in video xxxx .",
    "we calculate the susceptibility @xmath36 , in the same manner as we did for natural swarms , in the disordered phase , @xmath52 and find a clear increase of @xmath36 on lowering @xmath50 ( fig.[fig : vicsek ] ) .",
    "this increase of the susceptibility is coherent with the existence of an ordering transition at @xmath53 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the transition in the metric vicsek model is first order @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that , unless @xmath13 is much larger than the values analyzed here , the transition is hardly distinguishable from a second order one @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the susceptibility is expected to become very large approaching @xmath53 and to follow the usual scaling relation of critical phenomena @xcite , @xmath54 a fit to equation ( [ umma ] ) of the @xmath5-vicsek data is reported in fig.[fig : vicsek ] , giving @xmath55 and a transition point , @xmath56 .",
    "the reason for the growth of @xmath36 approaching @xmath53 in the vicsek model is quite intuitive .",
    "the model is metric , so that at large @xmath50 , namely when the nearest neighbour distance @xmath38 is much larger than the interaction range @xmath43 , very few individuals interact with each other , and coordination is small .",
    "the smaller @xmath50 becomes , the larger the number of particles within the mutual interaction range , thus promoting the correlation of larger and larger clusters of particles .",
    "for this reason the correlation length and the susceptibility grow when the nearest neighbour distance decreases .",
    "when @xmath50 approaches its critical value , the coordinated clusters become as large as the whole system , so that the groups orders below @xmath53 .     in the disordered phase , but close to the ordering transition .",

    "the full line represents the best fit to equation ( [ umma ] ) . ]",
    "the low order parameter , the nontrivial correlation function , and especially the increase of @xmath36 on decreasing the nearest neighbour distance , are phenomenological traits that the metric visek model shares with natural swarms .",
    "we conclude that a system based solely on alignment can be in its disordered phase and yet display large correlations , as midge swarms do .",
    "it is interesting to note that by approaching the ordering transition a compound amplification of the coorelation occurs : when the nearest neighbour distance , @xmath38 , decreases , the spatial span of the correlation , @xmath28 , increases , so that the effective perception range in units of nearest neighbour distance , @xmath58 is boosted .",
    "we emphasize that we are not quantitatively fitting vicsek model to our data .",
    "our only aim is to demonstrate a general concept : large correlation and lack of global order can coexist even in the simplest model of nearest neighbours alignment , provided that the system is sufficiently close to an ordering transition .    * estimating the interaction range . *",
    "the consistency between our experimental data and the vicsek model suggests that an underlying ordering transition could be present in swarms as well .",
    "an ordering transition as a function of the density has been indeed observed in laboratory experiments on locusts @xcite , fish @xcite and in observations of oceanic fish shoals @xcite . in these cases , both sides ( low and high density ) of the ordering transition",
    ". however , midge swarms in the field are always disordered , living in the low - density / high-@xmath50 side of the transition . locating a transition point having data on just one side of it ,",
    "is a risky business .",
    "the reason why we want to do this here is because it will allow us to give a rough estimate of the metric range of interaction in midges , which can be compared with other experiments .",
    "if a vicsek - like ordering transition exist , we can use equation ( [ umma ] ) to fit the swarms data for @xmath36 ( fig.[fig : chi ] ) .",
    "as we already mentioned , we do not know the value of the metric perception range , @xmath43 , in swarms .",
    "therefore , we use as scaling variable @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the body length .",
    "although the fit works reasonably well ( fig.[fig : chi ] ) , the scatter in the data is quite large ; hence , given the nonlinear nature of the fit , it would be unwise to pin down just one value for the parameters , and we rather report confidence intervals .",
    "the fit gives a transition point in the range , @xmath59 $ ] , with an exponent in the range , @xmath60 $ ] ( larger exponents correspond to lower transition points ) .",
    "interestingly , there is an alternative way to locate the ordering transition that does not rely on the fit of @xmath36 .",
    "let us establish a link between pairs of insects closer than the perception range @xmath43 and calculate the size of the biggest connected cluster in the network .",
    "given a swarm with nearest neighbour distance @xmath38 , the larger @xmath43 , the larger this cluster .",
    "when @xmath43 exceeds the percolation threshold , @xmath61 , a giant cluster of the same order as the group size appears @xcite .",
    "we calculate the percolation threshold in swarms ( fig.[fig : percolation ] and methods ) and find @xmath62 .",
    "the crucial point is that varying the perception range @xmath43 at fixed nearest neighbour distance @xmath38 , is equivalent to varying @xmath38 at fixed @xmath43 .",
    "hence , at fixed @xmath43 , there is an equivalent percolation threshold of the nearest neighbour distance , @xmath63 , such that for @xmath64 a giant cluster appears .",
    "clearly , @xmath65 .",
    "it is reasonable to hypothesize that the critical nearest neighbour distance is close to the maximal distance compatible with a connected network , given @xmath43 .",
    "a sparser network would cause the swarm to lose bulk connectivity .",
    "therefore , given a certain perception range @xmath43 , the ordering transition occurs at values of the nearest neighbour distance @xmath38 close to its percolation threshold , @xmath66 .    at this point",
    "we have two independent ( and possibly equally unreliable ) estimates of the transition point in natural swarms of midges : the first one in units of body - lenghts , @xmath59 $ ] ; the second one in units of interaction range , @xmath67 . putting the two together",
    "we finally obtain an estimate of the metric interaction range in units of body - lengths , @xmath68 .",
    "the body length of the species under consideration is in the range , @xmath69mm@xmath70 mm .",
    "this implies a perception range of a few centimeters , @xmath71 cm , depending on the species .",
    "this crude estimate of the midge interaction range is compatible with the hypothesis that midges interact acoustically .",
    "in @xcite the male - to - male auditory response in _ chironomus annularius _ ( diptera : chironomidae ) was studied and it was found that the range of the response was about @xmath72 cm , not too far from our estimate .",
    "similar measurements in mosquitoes ( diptera : culicidae ) show that the auditory perception range is about @xmath73 cm @xcite , which is again compatible with our determination of the interaction range in midge swarms .",
    "we have shown that natural swarms of midges lack collective order and yet display strong correlations . such correlations extends spatially much beyond the inter - individual distance , indicating the presence of significant cluster of coordinated individuals .",
    "this phenomenology is incompatible with a system of noninteracting particles whose swarming behaviour is solely due to the attraction to an external landmark .",
    "we conclude that genuine collective behaviour is present in swarms . by using vicsek model as a simple conceptual framework",
    ", we have showed that this coexistence of disorder and correlation is a general feature of systems with alignment interaction close to their ordering transition .",
    "we stress that the existence of correlation , and therefore of inter - individual interaction , is not in contradiction with the fact that a swarm almost invariably forms in proximity of a marker .",
    "the effect of the marker ( external force ) is merely to keep the swarm at a stationary position with respect to the environment .",
    "however , as we have shown in the case of the noninteracting swarm , this stationarity ( which superficially would seems the only visible trait of swarming ) , can not by itself produce the observed strong correlations .",
    "we believe that correlation , rather than order , is the most significant experimental signature of collective behaviour .",
    "correlation is a measure of how much and how far the behavioural change of one individual affects that of other individuals not directly interacting with it .",
    "our data show that in swarms correlations are so strong that the effective perception range of each midge is much larger than the actual interaction range .",
    "if the change of behaviour is due to some environmental perturbations , such large correlation guarantees that the stimulus is perceived at a collective level .",
    "a notion of collective behaviour based on correlation is more general and unifying than one based on order .",
    "for example , bird flocks and insect swarms look like completely different systems as long as we stick to collective order",
    ". however , once we switch to correlation , we understand that this big difference may be deceptive : both flocks and swarms are strongly correlated systems , in which the effective perception range , or correlation length , is far larger than the interaction range @xcite . in this perspective , the striking difference in emergent order between the two systems , namely the fact that flocks move around the sky , whereas swarms do not , may be related to different ecological factors , rather than to any fundamental qualitative difference in the way these systems interact .",
    "strong correlations similar to those found in bird flocks and midge swarms have also been experimentally measured in neural assemblies @xcite .",
    "this huge diversity - birds , insects , neurons - is bewildering but fascinating , and it suggests that correlation may be a universal condition for collective behaviour , bridging the gap between vastly different biological systems .    0.3 truecm * acknowledgments . * we thank william bialek , enzo branchini , massimo cencini , francesco ginelli and dov levine for discussions .",

    "imagine that a gust of wind shifts the entire swarm , so that each midges s velocity is dominated by the wind speed . as an effect of the wind , midges @xmath15 and @xmath18 would be moving nearly parallel to each other , so that the non - connected correlation would be high .",

    "the presence of non - zero connected correlation in a system is unambiguous proof that there is interaction , and strong enough to produce collective effects .    to compute the connected correlation function we therefore need to identify the collective modes of motion of the system and subtract them from the individual motion ( see methods ) . in this way",
    "we obtain the velocity fluctuation , namely the velocity of midge @xmath15 in a reference frame that not only is co - moving with the centre of mass , but also rotating and expanding / contracting as the whole swarm .",

    "it is very important to realize that an error or an artifact in computing the fluctuations can lead to spurious values of the correlation . as an example , consider two different and unrelated swarms moving in opposite directions , because of some weird fluctuation of the wind . if we fail to notice that these are _ two _ systems and analyze our data as if they were _",
    "one _ , we get a zero net motion of the centre of mass .",
    "hence , the velocity fluctuations are equal to the full velocities , and we are effectively computing a non - connected correlation , rather than a connected one , giving the delusion of very large correlation .    in the main text we show that swarms are mostly disordered",
    ". however , the fact that order parameters are low on average , does not mean that we can use the full velocities to compute the correlation function .",
    "as we have already said , a brief gust of wind can push the non - connected correlation function , to very high values . in this study",
    ", we are not investigating the origin of the order parameters fluctuations , but we focus on correlations . hence , we have to be sure that correlation is computed in a way to avoid any spurious signal from the collective modes .",
    "in a stationary system , it can be proved @xcite that the susceptibility is equal to the collective response of the system to uniform external perturbations .",
    "maximum entropy calculations @xcite show that the stationary probability distribution of the velocities in systems where there is an alignment interaction is given by , @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the strength of the interaction ( depending on distance @xmath19 in a metric system ) and @xmath164 is a normalizing factor ( the partition function ) , @xmath165 if an external perturbation ( or field ) @xmath166 couples uniformly to all velocities , this distribution gets modified as , @xmath167 now we ask what is the collective response @xmath36 of the system to a small variation of the perturbation @xmath166 . to answer this question we calculate the variation of the global order parameter , i.e. of the space average of the velocity , under a small variation of @xmath166 .",
    "we have , @xmath168 where we have disregarded the vectorial nature of the quantities not to burden the notation and where we have defined , @xmath169 apart from the missing normalization , needed to make @xmath36 dimensionless , the quantity in ( [ monster ] ) is exactly the susceptibility defined in the main text , equation @xmath170 .",
    "let us now analyze in detail the relation between correlation function and susceptibility in a finite size system , where instead of the ensemble averages , @xmath171 , we can only perform space averages . from equations",
    "@xmath172 and @xmath170 in main text , we obtain : @xmath173 if we make the hypothesis that mass fluctuations are not strong , we can write , @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the density . hence , we get , @xmath176 where we have used the simple relationship between density and nearest neighbours distance , @xmath177 . in an infinitely large system ,",
    "the bulk susceptibility is simply , @xmath178 , that is the full volume integral of the connected correlation function . in a finite size system , however , due to the constraint , @xmath179 , we must have , @xmath180 for all systems , be they natural or synthetic , irrespective of the amount of real correlation .",
    "this relation is simply the mathematical consequence of the way velocity fluctuations are defined .",
    "therefore , in a finite systems the susceptibility can be estimated as the maximum value reached by @xmath33 ( this maximum is a lower bound for the bulk susceptibility ) .",
