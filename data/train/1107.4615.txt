    "a collection of interacting particles on an ordered or disordered substrate undergoes a depinning transition under an applied drive from a pinned state with immobile particles to an elastic or plastic sliding state @xcite . in an elastic sliding state",
    ", each particle keeps the same neighbors over time @xcite , while in a plastic sliding state , the particles do not keep the same neighbors @xcite .",
    "many systems show a transition from elastic depinning for weak substrates to plastic depinning for strong substrates that is associated with changes in the velocity force curves and the depinning threshold as well as the onset of strong hysteretic effects @xcite .",
    "for example , the peak effect phenomenon for the transport of superconducting vortices , where a peak in the critical depinning force or critical current appears as a function of temperature or magnetic field , has been associated with a transition from elastic to plastic depinning and is known to be related to the disordering of the vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "although the peak effect is primarily associated with superconductors , it can in principle appear in other systems that undergo a transition from elastic to plastic depinning .",
    "several recent studies of colloidal systems and frictional systems have revealed peak effect - like behavior @xcite .",
    "plastic depinning transitions exhibit a wide variety of characteristics depending on whether the substrate is random @xcite or periodic @xcite .",
    "the resulting plastic flow ranges from motion in winding channels to avalanche behaviors with strong fluctuations , coexistence of large pinned and flowing regions , or transitions from two - dimensional ( 2d ) mixing phases to one - dimensional ( 1d ) decoupled channel phases . for higher drives ,",
    "many systems undergo a transition from plastic flow to a more ordered flow state , such as a moving smectic state where the particles organize into 1d channels that can slide past one another @xcite or partially ordered moving crystal states @xcite .    due to the complexity of plastic depinning phenomena in 2d and three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems",
    ", numerous simpler systems have been proposed that still exhibit plastic depinning , such as particles flowing in a series of simple coupled layers .",
    "many systems with depinning transitions can be modeled effectively as layered systems , including sliding charge density waves @xcite and vortices in strongly layered superconductors @xcite .",
    "advances in fabrication techniques have made it possible to create nanostructured systems in which particles such as vortices move through effectively 1d coupled channels @xcite .",
    "considered a mean field anisotropic slip model of coupled channels of particles oriented parallel to a driving force @xcite . along each channel , the particle interactions are elastic , but slip can occur between neighboring channels . in this model , when the depinning is elastic the channels show no slip or hysteresis , but for plastic depinning there is both slip and hysteresis .",
    "further theoretical work on systems with only two layers demonstrated that a transition from non - hysteretic elastic depinning to hysteretic plastic depinning occurs as a function of disorder @xcite . for 3d layered sliding charge density wave systems , a transition from an elastic depinning to plastic hysteretic depinning has also been predicted @xcite , along with a second coupling transition at higher drives when the charge density waves begin to flow coherently . numerical work on 3d layered superconducting vortex systems has shown a similar disorder - induced transition from elastic to plastic flow marked by a large increase in the depinning threshold when the layers decouple , which is typical of a peak effect behavior @xcite .",
    "we note that although the transition to plastic depinning is marked by an increase in the depinning threshold , in real superconductors the depinning threshold decreases as the superconducting critical temperature or field is approached due to the changing penetration depth .",
    "this feature is generally not included in most simulations .    in this work",
    "we consider a simple depinning model consisting of two or more coupled 1d channels of repulsively interacting particles , all of which are subjected to a driving force and quenched disorder .",
    "this system could be experimentally realized using colloidal particles in coupled 1d channels with a disordered substrate and driven by an external electric field @xcite , coupled 1d wires containing wigner crystal phases @xcite , or vortices on corrugated substrates driven parallel to the corrugation .",
    "our simulations of this model include much more detail than can be captured in mean field studies @xcite .",
    "in addition to confirming many of the predictions from the theoretical studies , we find a rich variety of new features .",
    "we induce decoupling transitions by changing the relative strength of the disorder from channel to channel , something that has not been considered in previous work on the depinning of layered systems .",
    "we also study commensuration effects by varying the particle density in one channel relative to the density in other channels .",
    "we drive all of the layers of particles ; previous studies of this type of model considered transformer geometries with the drive applied to only one layer @xcite . despite the apparent simplicity of our model , we find that even the two layer system has a wide variety of dynamical phases and exhibits all the salient features found for elastic and plastic depinning phenomena , including a peak effect at the transition between the two types of depinning .",
    "we also show that the transport signatures of the dynamical coupling and recoupling transitions can be enhanced in systems where the channels do not all have the same amount of disorder , suggesting that experimental realizations of this geometry may be an excellent way to probe these dynamical states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe our model and simulation technique .",
    "section iii discusses decoupling transitions in a two channel system as the spacing between channels is varied , as well as a peak effect appearing at the transition from elastic to plastic depinning . in section iv , we consider two channel samples in which the strength of the disorder differs in the two channels , where we observe drag - induced pinning as well as hysteretic velocity - force signatures . in section",
    "v , we find commensuration effects when the number of particles in each channel is varied for a two channel system , and we also study the effect of changing the particle - particle interaction prefactor .",
    "we introduce an eight channel system in section vi and show that as disorder strength and channel coupling is varied , the behavior resembles that of the two channel system .",

    "<S> using numerical simulations , we examine a simple model of two or more coupled one - dimensional channels of driven particles with repulsive interactions in the presence of quenched disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this model exhibits a remarkably rich variety of dynamical behavior as a function of the strength of the quenched disorder , coupling between channels , and external drive . for weaker disorder , </S>",
    "<S> the channels depin in a single step . for two channels </S>",
    "<S> we find dynamically induced decoupling transitions that result in coexisting pinned and moving phases as well as moving decoupled phases where particles in both channels move at different average velocities and slide past one another . </S>",
    "<S> decoupling can also be induced by changing the relative strength of the disorder in neighboring channels . at higher drives , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a dynamical recoupling or locking transition into a state with no relative motion between the channels . </S>",
    "<S> this recoupling produces unusual velocity - force signatures , including negative differential conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the depinning threshold shows distinct changes near the decoupling and coupling transitions and exhibits a peak effect phenomenon of the type that has been associated with transitions from elastic to plastic flow in other systems . </S>",
    "<S> we map several dynamic phase diagrams showing the coupling - decoupling transitions and the regions in which hysteresis occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the coexistence regime for channels with unequal amounts of quenched disorder . for multiple channels </S>",
    "<S> , multiple coupling and decoupling transitions can occur ; however , many of the general features found for the two channel system are still present . </S>",
    "<S> our results should be relevant to depinning in layered geometries in systems such as vortices in layered or nanostructured superconductors and wigner or colloidal particles confined in nano - channels ; they are also relevant to the general understating of plastic flow . </S>"
