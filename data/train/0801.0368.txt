    "one of the most important goals of _ ab initio _ computational electronic - structure theory is the development of accurate methods for describing interatomic bonding . quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques are useful in this regard as they can provide a highly accurate description of electron correlation effects .",
    "although qmc methods are computationally expensive , they can be applied to systems which are large enough to model condensed matter .    in this study",
    "we have considered solid neon , in which the bonding arises from the competition between short - range repulsion and the van der waals attraction between the atoms .",
    "high - quality experimental measurements of the equation of state ( eos ) exist , which can be used as reference data .",
    "furthermore , various neon pair potentials have been developed using experimental and theoretical data , which can also be used for comparison purposes .",
    "solid neon is therefore an ideal system in which to test the descriptions of van der waals bonding and short - range repulsion offered by various theoretical methods .",
    "we have calculated theoretical eos s for crystalline neon using the qmc and density - functional theory ( dft ) _ ab initio _ electronic - structure methods as well as various interatomic pair potentials .",
    "standard dft methods do not describe van der waals bonding accurately , but they might be expected to work quite well at high densities , where the short - range repulsion dominates .",
    "the high - pressure properties of neon are of some experimental interest , because neon is often used as a pressure - conducting medium in diamond - anvil - cell experiments.@xcite we have therefore extended the range of our qmc eos for neon to very high pressures ( about 400  gpa ) .",
    "the zero - point energy ( zpe ) of the lattice - vibration modes makes a small but important contribution to the total energy of solid neon .",
    "we have therefore studied the lattice dynamics of solid neon within the quasiharmonic - phonon approximation and within the einstein approximation , using dft methods and pair potentials .    for some time",
    "there has been considerable interest in developing neon pair potentials in order to test the accuracy of theoretical methods for calculating the properties of materials.@xcite we have performed a direct calculation of the neon pair potential using qmc .",
