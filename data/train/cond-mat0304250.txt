    "a dramatic progress has been made over last decade in employing the single - molecule micromanipulation techniques for studies of biological materials and processes .",
    "pioneered by the work of smith et .",
    "stretch on stretching of double  stranded dna ( dsdna ) , these techniques have later been applied to study proteins , dna  protein interactions , chromosomes etc . the chain  stretching experiments were also performed on single  stranded dna molecules ( ssdna)@xcite-@xcite .",
    "one could expect the response of ssdna to stretching to be dramatically different from that of dsdna , because of the effects of the possible basepairing between complementary segments of the chain .",
    "the need for understanding of the resulting mechanical behavior has already attracted a considerable attention of theorists @xcite-@xcite . in particular , it has been shown @xcite-@xcite that in the thermodynamic limit , ssdna chain should undergo the second  order phase transition , at finite critical force .",
    "formally , this phenomenon is very similar to the hypothetical native  molten transition in rna @xcite , as well as to the classical ( yet unconfirmed ) picture of dsdna denaturation @xcite .",
    "the predicted critical behavior is qualitatively different from another related phenomenon , the force - induced denaturation ( unzipping ) of dsdna unzip1-@xcite .",
    "the unzipping is a first  order transition , which occurs as a result of competition between the elastic energy of the stretched ssdna , and the basepairing ( hybridization ) energy within dsdna .",
    "the very same effects are essential for the above second - order phase transition in stretched ssdna . as a part of the present work",
    ", we will clarify the relationship between the two phenomena .",
    "the theoretical modelling of ssdna and rna is traditionally done within freely joint chain ( fjc ) model .",
    "its extensible version has been originally used for fitting of the early ssdna stretching data @xcite . however , both the microscopic structure of ssdna , and the recent experiments with dna hairpin constructs @xcite-@xcite , strongly suggest the picture with a finite bending modulus of its backbone , which feature is reminiscent of the semiflexible worm  like chain ( wlc ) model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , being a continuous model , the wlc description is unlikely to be valid in the regimes when discrete nature of chemical bonds becomes relevant ( e.g. for a sufficiently high stretching force ) . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "discreet persistent chain ( dpc ) model has been proposed for ssdna in recent work by storm and nelson @xcite .",
    "interestingly , wlc itself was originally introduced by kratky and porod @xcite as a continuous limit of a similar discreetized model .",
    "the authors of @xcite have shown , that the extensible versions of all three models ( fjc , wlc , and dpc ) produce a good fit to the experimentally observed stretching curves , as long as force is not too high ( @xmath0 for fjc , and @xmath1 for wlc / dpc ) .     the central idea of our paper is to include the effects of basepairing within a theoretical framework compatible with an arbitrary underlying model of ssdna elasticity . in this way we can separate the two parts of the problem : the search of an adequate elastic description of ssdna , and the evaluation of the effects of its self - interactions .",
    "in fact , one may be able to start with an empirical elastic models extracted from independent experiments , and use our theory to predict the stretching behavior of the chain after `` switching on '' the basepairing interactions .",
    "we consider ssdna chain subjected to external pulling force @xmath2 . as an input for our theory , one has to specify two functions characterizing the system without self  interactions : @xmath3  elastic free energy per unit chain length vs. pulling force ; and @xmath4  free energy of a loop as a function of its contour length .",
    "our goal is to study the effect of interactions between complementary segments of the chain .",
    "similarly to ref @xcite , we assume the interaction strength to be the same  for any two chain fragments",
    ". it will be characterized by a single parameter , @xmath5 ,  defined as pairing energy per unit chain length . strictly speaking ,",
    "this should limit applicability of our approach to self  complementary periodic sequences of ssdna ( such as atatat ... ) .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite-@xcite , this uniform model may be reasonably adequate for random sequences , too .",
    "nevertheless , the effect of randomness remains an important problem for the future studies .",
    "hybridization of distant chain segments results in looping .",
    "therefore , the interactions reduce the effective ( free ) chain length @xmath6 exposed to the stretching force .",
    "our goal is to calculate the partition function of the system @xmath7 , parameterized by the total chain length @xmath8 , and free length @xmath6 .",
    "the general form of the interaction ",
    "free partition function is , @xmath9 , because @xmath6 and @xmath8 coincide , and different chain segments are statistically independent ( we neglect excluded volume effects ) . without loss of generality , one can choose @xmath10 .",
    "it is useful to perform double laplace transform of partition function @xmath7 .",
    "this results in introduction of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , conjugated to @xmath8 and @xmath6 respectively ( parameter @xmath11 conjugated to the total length , is often called fugacity ) : @xmath13 \\mathrm{d}l\\mathrm{d}l.\\]]in particular , @xmath14 . since the elastic part of free energy is @xmath15 , the overall free energy may be expressed as @xmath16here and below , we take @xmath17 .    it is well known that the partition function of a uniform rna or ssdna may be calculated in a recursive manner , reminiscent of hartree approximation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this calculation can be represented in a diagrammatic form shown in figure [ diag ] .",
    "the solid lines correspond to bare partition function @xmath18 ; dotted fragments connected with dashed lines represent pairing ( hybridization ) of the corresponding chain segments . within our approach ,",
    "the energy cost of the pairing is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the length of the hybridized region , and @xmath6 is the free length of the chain segment being `` internalized '' due to the looping . in fact , one can extend our approach to a more general form of hybridization energy , @xmath21 , with constant @xmath22 representing the energy cost of termination of the double  stranded segment .",
    "introduction of @xmath23 accounts for the cooperativity of the basepairing interactions .",
    "traditionally , problems involving dna / rna folding or denaturation , are studied within a discreet model .",
    "each discrete `` monomer '' in this approach represents a chain segment which can hybridize independently of its neighbors .",
    "its length is assumed to be equal to the statistical segment , which makes it easy to combine this description with fjc model .",
    "since we are interested in  developing a theory for an arbitrary model of chain elasticity , it is logical to abandon this artificial discretization of hybridized segments .",
    "of course , the basepairing remains fundamentally discreet on the length scale @xmath24 of a single base .",
    "as long as the relevant physics occurs on larger scales , ssdna can be considered as a continuous chain .",
    "the crucial observation is that one can typically neglect all the diagrams with intersecting dashed lines .",
    "such situation would correspond to `` pseudo  knot '' , whose probability is low because it requires winding of ssdna / rna around itself ( fig . [",
    "thanks to this topological constrain , `` self energy '' diagram entering dyson equation ( fig [ diag]c ) , may be calculated exactly within one - loop ( hartree ) approximation . since we have assumed the uniform interaction parameter , the problem has a particularly simple form at the laplace representation : @xmath25 .",

    "\\label{wq}\\ ] ]",
    "in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath30),@xmath31here function @xmath32 again corresponds to the pole in @xmath33 , i.e. it is inverse to @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{mu}\\]]this yields the following result for the free length as a function of tension:@xmath36here @xmath37 .",
    "note that from the definition of function @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ wq ] ) , one can relate its logarithmic derivative to the average length of the loop:@xmath39    if @xmath6 is known , one can easily find the relative elongation of the chain , i.e. the ratio of the end - to - end distance @xmath40 to the total chain length @xmath8 , which is observable experimentally:@xmath41here @xmath42 is the relative elongation of the free portion of the chain .    according to eq .",
    "( [ lf2 ] ) , in the strong stretching limit ( @xmath43 ) the chain becomes completely `` free '' : @xmath44 .",
    "further examination of our expression for the free length reveals its peculiar behavior near the point @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , in the limit of vanishing @xmath38 ( i.e. very high energy cost of a loop ) , @xmath46 becomes a step function changing from @xmath47 to @xmath8 at that point . in a realistic situation",
    ", it is transformed into a crossover whose width depends on @xmath38 , as@xmath48since the location of that crossover corresponds to the point were the hybridization free energy is exactly equal to the elastic one , we conclude that this behavior is directly related to the first - order _ unzipping _ transition  of dsdna .",
    "the transition is transformed into the crossover due to the finite size of the hybridized segments .",
    "another  important feature of our result is that the free fraction of the chain @xmath49 goes to zero at finite tension @xmath50 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ lf2 ] ) the condition for this to happen is , @xmath51this point corresponds to the second order phase transition , which has been reported in the earlier studies of the problem .",
    "the crucial observation is that this transition is physically distinct from the unzipping crossover .",
    "it may be viewed as a precursor of the force - induced denaturation . indeed ,",
    "even when the tension in the free segments is still insufficient to overcome the binding energy @xmath52 , one can convert a finite fraction of the chain into the free length without breaking any bonds .",
    "namely , since there is a finite density of loops at the folded ssdna , one can simply `` move '' the unbound bases from the loops to the free segment .",
    "this will only result in an entropy loss , but will not reduce the interaction energy .    indeed ,",
    "if the basepairing energy is negative , the magnitude of the critical tension is somewhat lower ( @xmath53 ) than that at the unzipping point : @xmath54    the free segments of the chain exposed to the external stretching can be viewed as topologically distinct objects ( `` vortices '' ) , which separates the system onto independently folded domains .",
    "the effective interaction potential of two consequent vortices is determined by the free energy of the folded region between them .  at the point @xmath55 ,",
    "the typical separation between the vortices along the chain coordinate , i.e. the size of the separable domains , diverges . this _ folding - unfolding _ transition occurs as a result of competition between the elastic tension and folding entropy , which grows with the domain size .",
    "interestingly , eq .",
    "( [ transition ] ) has physical solutions even for positive interaction energy , i.e. when the basepairing is energetically unfavorable .",
    "it follows form that fact that for @xmath56 , the generic behavior of looping free energy is @xmath57 , ( for an ideal gaussian chain ) . as a result",
    ", @xmath58 remains finite for @xmath59 , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 are diverging , as @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ transition ] ) , there is a finite tension at which the unfolding transition takes place , for @xmath63 .",
    "the asymptotic relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath55 in this regime is ,    @xmath65    this yields a power law dependence of the critical tension on @xmath64 : @xmath66 .",
    "note however that our conclusion about the unfolding transition at positive values of basepairing energy , may well be a result of limitations of the model .",
    "as an example , we discuss the application of the above approach to the particular case of wlc model .",

    "the fact that @xmath83 is a small parameter allows us to simplify the results . in the regime of negative @xmath64 ,",
    "a sharp unzipping crossover is expected . as we have discussed in the previous section ,",
    "its characteristic width is given by @xmath90 \\label{deltaq}\\]]in the vicinity of the crossover point , @xmath45 , the change in free length can be well described by the universal function of rescaled variable @xmath91 : @xmath92for large enough @xmath93 , this universal behavior breaks down due to the proximity of the unfolding phase transition .",

    "( [ deltaq ] ) , its sharpness increases with lowering parameter @xmath83 .",
    "this can be associated with growth of the typical length of hybridized regions .",
    "the unzipping is clearly separated from second  order unfolding transition .",
    "while this crossover regime was not present at the early studies of the problem , it has been recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "the traditional fjc - based model has been modified to include the effects of cooperativity , analogous to our parameter @xmath23 .",
    "as we have discussed , the sharp crossover should be interpreted as unzipping ( force induced denaturation ) , while the second - order transition corresponds to topological change ( unfolding ) which may be viewed as a precursor of the unzipping .",
    "this physical picture is consistent with the results of ref .",
    "muller . on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis disagrees with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the first order phase transition was predicted for the regime of strong enough hybridization energy .",
    "here we discuss how the above results may depend on the choice of the elastic description of ssdna .",
    "it should be noted that such important features , as the unfolding transition and the unzipping crossover , are very robust and nearly independent of the model .",
    "furthermore , it is well known the stretching curve of ssdna may be fitted reasonably well by several models , e.g.  extensible versions of fjc , wlc , or dpc .",
    "this implies that deduction of @xmath96 from the existing and future experimental data is unlikely to provide a sensitive test for the possible models . on the other hand",
    ", we have seen that the loop free energy @xmath97 and consequently @xmath58 are significant parameters of the problem .",
    "as we shall see , this parameters are very sensitive to the choice of the underlying elastic model .    in the case of discreet persistent chain ( dpc ) model",
    ", we do not expect any significant deviation of @xmath98 or @xmath58 from those obtained for wlc model , since the typical bending radius significantly exceeds the bond length .",
    "the ( extensible ) fjc model has been a standard framework in which the discussed problem has been studied so far .",
    "nevertheless , here we briefly review the results of our theory for fjc , in order to identify the major model - dependent features .",
    "the freely joint chain consists of discreet bonds of length @xmath99 , whose orientations are mutually independent .",
    "the corresponding loop free energy can be written as , @xmath100 \\simeq 2\\left ( \\frac{3}{2\\pi } \\right ) ^{3/2}% \\frac{v_{0}}{l_{p}^{2}}\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{\\delta \\left ( l-2nl_{p}\\right ) } { n^{3/2}}\\]]the prefactor here ensures that the asymptotic behavior of the free energy at the large ",
    "loops limit coincides with the wlc result , given by eq .",
    "( floop ) .",
    "now , one can find @xmath58 for fjc model:@xmath101    for negative @xmath64 , the change of the elastic description results in a modest shift of the critical tension @xmath55 at which the unfolding transition occurs : @xmath102this should be compared to wlc result , eq .",
    "( [ qstarwlc ] ) .    while the position of the unzipping point , @xmath45 , is model independent",
    ", the width of the crossover is very sensitive to the behavior of @xmath58 .",
    "as one can see in figure [ wq ] , the shapes of @xmath103 curves are substantially different for wlc and fjc models .",
    "this difference arrises because of the relative suppression of the short loops in wlc case .",
    "what is especially remarkable is that the width of the unzipping crossover , @xmath104 decreases with @xmath64 in a strongly model dependent manner .",
    "in fact , upon change of @xmath105 from @xmath47 ( dsdna denaturation point ) to @xmath106 ( which  roughly corresponds to physiological conditions for gcgcgc sequence ) , the ratio of @xmath107 for the two models changes by factor of @xmath108 . therefore , an experimental study of the unzipping crossover at variable conditions ( e.g. temperature ) , would open a new possibility of testing the plausible models of ssdna elasticity .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the effects of basepairing on the stretching behavior of ssdna , within a theoretical framework compatible with an arbitrary underlying model of chain elasticity .",
    "our conclusion is that in a generic case , the stretching curves exhibits two related but distinct feature : the second  order _ unfolding _ phase transition , and the sharp _ unzipping _ crossover .",
    "the latter is reminiscent of the first ",
    "order transition in dsdna , as well as to the mechanical response of non - random rna molecules@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have interpret the unfolding as a topological transition . at the critical point ,",
    "the typical size of independently folded domains diverges ( in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "this transition is due to the competition of conformational entropy and elastic free energy , and it is expected to occur even in the regime when basepairing is energetically unfavorable .    in the light of our results , one can see a clear relationship between the three types of the force - induced denaturation : ( i ) unzipping of dsdnaunzip1-@xcite , ( ii ) denaturation of rna with a preferred secondary structure@xcite , and ( iii ) stretching a self  complimentary or random ssdna . while in the case of dsdna the unzipping occurs as a first order transition",
    ", it becomes a crossover for the two other cases .",
    "the width of the crossover is defined by the typical length of a single hybridized region .",
    "we expect this width to be sensitive to the sequence of ssdna / rna .",
    "in fact , the force - induced denaturation of rna @xcite was predicted to show a sequence of unzipping steps .",
    "it follows from our discussion that the sharpness of those steps may be even more pronounced than was originally predicted within fjc - based model . in the case of ssdna",
    ", the sequence disorder must result in smearing of the unzipping crossover .",
    "because of its entropic nature , the unfolding transition is expected only in the case of ssdna ( or long rna , in molten phase @xcite ) .    at present ,",
    "the experimental indications of the second order unfolding transition are not conclusive enough @xcite-@xcite . on the other hand , experiments with uniform self",
    " complimentary dna show a clear manifestation of the sharp unzipping crossover @xcite . however , their precision is still insufficient to make a quantitative comparison with the theory , and to distinguish between different underlying elastic models .",
    "based on our theory , one may extract this information by performing a systematic experimental study of the unzipping behavior for various values of hybridization energy ( e.g. various temperatures ) .",
    "as we have shown , the width of the crossover is very sensitive to the energy cost of the hairpin loop ."
