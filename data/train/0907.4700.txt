    "the ground - state fluctuations of the electromagnetic field lead to several inherently quantum effects such as the spontaneous decay of excited atoms and molecules as well as dispersion forces @xcite .",

    "the third type of dispersion ( in a sense an interpolation between these two extreme cases ) is the casimir  polder ( cp ) force exerted on single atoms near macroscopic bodies @xcite .",

    "intuitively , dispersion forces can be understood as dipole - dipole forces generated by spontaneous polarisation due to the electric - field fluctuations .",
    "therefore , cp forces on atoms at rest act either towards ( attractively ) or away ( repulsively ) from the macroscopic body . for atoms in motion , retardation delays the dipole response , and a force component emerges along the direction of motion . in most cases ,",

    "for such nonequilibrium situations , linear - response methods can not be applied and a more detailed investigation of the atom - field dynamics becomes necessary .    in this article , we develop a full quantum theory of the velocity - dependent cp force . in particular , we will show that for atoms and molecules in electronically excited states , both decelerating and accelerating forces can occur depending on relative magnitude of the frequencies of the atomic transition and the surface plasmon .",

    "for example , terms such as @xmath115 or @xmath116 will not contribute whereas terms such as @xmath117 or @xmath118 will .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict our attention to the nonretarded or near - field limit , where the dominant contribution to the green tensor is due to evanescent waves with @xmath119 . with this replacement , we have @xmath120 and eqs .",

    "let us discuss our results .",
    "we first note that in a quantum friction scenario of an atom moving parallel to a plane surface , a generalised doppler effect does not contribute to the velocity - dependent force ; this will be different for an atom moving perpendicularly towards the surface . in the near - field limit ,",
    "the magnetic rntgen coupling becomes becomes negligible as well ; it will become relevant for larger distances .",
    "near - field quantum friction forces are hence dominantly caused by a delay effect .    for a ground - state atom ,",
    "only a nonresonant force component  ( [ qf77 ] ) is present . with both @xmath132 and @xmath133 being positive quantities",
    ", @xmath134 is strictly antiparallel to the velocity and hence presents a genuine friction force .",
    "note that this force is proportional to the rates of spontaneous decay @xmath133 , the absorption parameters of the atom . in the near - field limit , these decay rates are given by @xcite @xmath135 inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ qf77 ] ) yields a friction force that is extremely short - ranged and falls off as @xmath136 .",
    "this is in contrast to previous theories @xcite that predict a @xmath137-scaling , resulting from a disregard of the distance - dependence of the spontaneous decay rate .    for an excited atom ,",
    "resonant forces arise as a consequence of possible transitions to lower lying atomic energy levels .",
    "they will dominate the velocity - dependent force , in particular if one of them is near - resonant with the surface plasmon frequency @xmath138 . depending on whether the respective atomic transition frequency @xmath139 is smaller or greater than the surface plasmon frequency",
    ", the velocity - dependent resonant force will either be a decelerating friction force antiparallel to the velocity , or it may be an quantum acceleration force parallel to the velocity .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood from an energy consideration .",
    "the energy @xmath140 emitted during a downward transition of the atom is resonantly absorbed by the surface and leads to the excitation of a surface plasmon with energy @xmath141 .",
    "the energy difference between these two reservoirs leads to a change in the atom s kinetic energy .",
    "if the emitted energy is smaller than the absorbed one , the atom has to decelerate ; if the emitted energy is greater than the absorbed one , the atom will accelerate .",
    "note also that the off - resonant contribution  ( [ qf77 ] ) consists of strictly accelerating downward contributions as well as strictly decelerating upward contributions which , as before , have a @xmath136-scaling and can be safely neglected with regard to the @xmath137-scaling of the resonant forces .",
    "it is known from previous studies @xcite that the rate of spontaneous decay increases for atoms in motion .",
    "this mechanism leads to a more rapid dissipation of the internal energy initially stored in the atom , restricting the life time of resonant forces ; it needs to be taken into account in a more quantitative analysis of energy conservation .",
    "in order to illustrate the effect of velocity - dependent forces on atoms , we present a selection of numerical examples . we will concentrate on forces that are dominated by a single atomic transition between a ground state @xmath142 and an excited state @xmath143 with frequency @xmath0 and ( isotropic ) dipole matrix element @xmath1 . in this case , the nonresonant ground - state force , eq .",
    "( [ qf77 ] ) , reduces to the simpler expression @xmath144 where the decay rate ( [ qf78 ] ) now reads @xmath145 the excited - state force is dominated by the resonant force component , @xmath146 @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 , @xmath150    as a first example , we consider a ground - state @xmath151rb atom moving parallel to a gold surface .",
    "we consider the lowest electronic transition @xmath152 with wavelength @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) @xcite and dipole moment @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the permittivity of gold may be characterised by a plasma frequency @xmath156 and an absorption parameter @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "note that the transverse resonance frequency vanishes for metals , @xmath158 , so that the surface plasmon resonance is located at @xmath159 . with these parameters",
    ", we find a deceleration of the rubidium atom as ( @xmath160 ) @xmath161 ^ 8 \\,.\\ ] ] the force is extremely short - ranged , and is negligible for any reasonable values of the velocity and atom - surface distance .",
    "in contrast , for an excited rubidium atom with the same data as above , the deceleration becomes @xmath162 ^ 5 \\,.\\ ] ] in comparison to the ground - state force , excited - state quantum friction is strongly enhanced and has a much longer range . for an atomic velocity of @xmath163 ,",
    "the deceleration at an atom - surface distance @xmath164 can be as large as @xmath165 .",
    "even at @xmath166 the deceleration is still @xmath167 .",
    "results for other atoms and metallic surfaces can be easily obtained by noting that in most cases , the relevant atomic transition frequency is much smaller than the surface plasmon frequency of the metal , hence @xmath168 . under this approximation ,",
    "the excited - state force ( [ eq : f1twolevel ] ) and the decay rate ( [ eq : gammatwolevel ] ) read @xmath169 and @xmath170 typical values for the material parameter @xmath171 are tabulated in ref .",
    "@xcite . note that unless the excitation is maintained by continuous repumping , the excited - state force only acts during a time interval @xmath172 .",
    "the relative velocity change during this time is approximately @xmath173 in this limit ( @xmath168 ) , the relative change in velocity is independent of the strength of the atomic dipole transition and all material parameters .    upon inspection of the excited - state force ( [ eq : f1twolevel ] )",
    "one notices that this force can be resonantly enhanced if an atomic transition matches the frequency of a surface plasmon resonance .",
    "an example of such a close match has been pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and involves a sapphire substrate with its principal surface plasmon at @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) and the @xmath176 transition in @xmath177cs with a wavelength of @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) . near this plasmon resonance , the permittivity of sapphire is well approximated by @xcite @xmath180 with @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 ;",
    "note that @xmath185 .",
    "with this model , and introducing the atom - plasmon detuning @xmath186 , we find that the force  ( [ qf73 ] ) and the decay rate  ( [ qf78 ] ) in the vicinity of the surface - plasmon resonance may be given as ( @xmath187 ) @xmath188 and @xmath189    with the dipole moment of the abovementioned transition being @xmath190 @xcite , one finds ( @xmath191 ) @xmath192 ^ 5\\,.\\ ] ] compared with the result ( [ eq : metalfriction ] ) for the excited - state force near a metal , we find a significantly enhanced force .",
    "note also that , because @xmath193 ( i.e. , @xmath194 ) , the force is accelerating rather than decelerating . as a numerical example , for a particle velocity of @xmath195 and an atom - surface distance of @xmath196 , one would observe an acceleration of @xmath197 .",
    "as before , without continuous repumping this force acts only for a very short time , leading to a net relative change in velocity @xmath198",
    "we have shown that atoms or molecules in relative motion with respect to a dielectric surface experience velocity - dependent cp forces . solving the coupled atom - field dynamics for a slowly moving atom",
    ", we have found an expression for the linearised velocity - dependent force on an atom in an arbitrary incoherent internal quantum state moving near an arbitrary arrangement of magnetoelectric bodies . in general , three effects contribute to the velocity - dependent casimir ",
    "polder force : a generalised doppler effect due to the velocity - dependence of the atomic transition frequencies , the delay between the emission and reabsorption of photons by the atom and the rntgen interaction , i.e. , to the coupling of the current density associated with the atomic motion to the magnetic field .",
    "in order to illustrate the general theory , we have studied the near - field force on an atom that moves parallel to a planar dielectric or metallic surface . due to the translational invariance of the system , the doppler term does not contribute in this case .",
    "furthermore , the delay term dominates over the rntgen term . for a ground - state atom",
    "the force is a genuine friction force , i.e. a force antiparallel to its velocity .",
    "it is proportional to the atomic linewidth and hence very small .",
    "in contrast , excited - state atoms can be either decelerated or accelerated depending on the relative magnitude of their transition frequency with respect to the characteristic frequency of the substrate material . for metals ,",
    "the force is always decelerating while for dielectric substrates with sufficiently small surface plasmon frequency , acceleration of excited - state atoms can be realised .",
    "in addition , the force on such atoms is strongly enhanced when atom and substrate are near - resonant .",
    "much stronger enhancement can be achieved when the atom moves through resonator structures , in close analogy to the stationary case @xcite .",
