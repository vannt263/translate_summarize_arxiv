    "the objects in the solar neighborhood with high peculiar velocities can always be placed into one of two categories : the disk - origin or non - disk origin .",
    "the normal , young , disk stars in the solar neighborhood share the same circular motion with the sun , and have small velocity residuals in a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 10 - 16 km  s@xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the disk - origin high velocity stars are the objects whose peculiar velocities are far beyond the velocity dispersion of normal disk stars .",
    "they are often called runaway stars because the high peculiar velocities of these stars are thought to be caused by two possible mechanisms : 1 ) supernova explosion in a binary system @xcite ; or 2 ) strong gravitational interaction in a multiple star system that often occurs in a dynamically chaotic , young , dense stellar cluster environment @xcite .",
    "previous studies of runaway stars show that both mechanisms generate runaway objects , but an early systematic survey by @xcite suggests that the second mechanism is dominant .",
    "on the other hand , most of the non - disk - origin , high velocity objects in the solar neighborhood are thought to belong to the old halo population .",
    "the halo stars have high peculiar velocities because they do not follow the circular motion of the normal disk stars but move in their own very diverse orbits .",
    "because of the significant difference in the ages of high velocity stars associated with these two origins , the runaway , disk origin is generally assumed for young objects like high velocity b stars .",
    "however , in this paper , we discuss the unusual case of a nearby , high velocity b - star , hd  69686 , and we argue that it may have been born far from the galactic disk .",
    "we are currently making a spectroscopic survey of field b stars to study the evolution of stellar rotation .",
    "one of our targets , hd  69686 , was selected because it is fairly bright ( @xmath3 ) and is classified as a b8 star in the sao star catalog . in this paper , we present what we have learned about hd  69686 . at the time of writing , the target s listing in the simbad database",
    "includes only very basic astrometry and photometry data and no published references . after measuring radial velocities of our program stars , hd  69686",
    "was immediately singled out by having the largest radial velocity , 148 km  s@xmath2 , among our sample b stars . only after this , we noticed that this star also has quite a large proper motion ( @xmath4 mas  yr@xmath2 , @xmath5 mas  yr@xmath2 , from the newly released _",
    "re - measurements by @xcite ) .",
    "thus , hd  69686 is a previously unknown high velocity b star .",
    "how old is this star now ?",
    "is it a runaway star ?",
    "where did it come from ?",
    "is it a binary system ?",
    "these are the kind of questions that we want to answer .    in the next section ,",
    "we briefly describe the instrumental setup and how we obtained the final spectra of hd  69686 . in  3 , we present the details of the procedure we used to determine the key parameters , such as the space velocity , the effective temperature , gravity , and age of the star . in  4",
    ", we use a modern galactic potential model to reconstruct the full trajectory of hd  69686 that helps us to locate its birthplace and leads us to suggest that hd  69686 might not be a runaway star as we thought previously . in the final section , we provide additional evidence implying that hd  69686 may been born in the galactic halo .",
    "the spectra of hd  69686 were obtained on the 2.1-m telescope at kpno using the goldcam spectrograph ( with a @xmath6 ccd detector , t3kc ) on 2008 november 17 and 18 .",
    "the spectrograph grating ( g47 , 831 lines mm@xmath2 ) was used in second order with a cuso@xmath7 blocking filter , and this arrangement provided spectrum coverage of about 900  around the central wavelength of 4400 .",
    "the slit width was set at @xmath8 , leading to a resolving power @xmath9 ( fwhm@xmath101.83  , measured in the comparison spectra ) .",
    "the integration time for hd  69686 was 55  s yielding spectra with s / n @xmath10 280 in the continuum regions . during the entire observing run",
    ", we took comparison ( henear lamp ) exposures for each of our program stars , including hd  69686 , to ensure accurate wavelength calibration of the spectra .",
    "the accuracy of wavelength calibration is estimated to be around 6 km  s@xmath2 in velocity space by checking the wavelength fitting residuals of the comparison spectra and by comparing multi - night spectra of all our program stars that are not spectroscopic binaries .",
    "we obtained the final reduced spectra by going through the standard iraf ccd image reduction ( subtracted the bias level , divided the flat images , removed cosmic rays , and fixed the bad pixels / columns ) and the long - slit stellar spectrum extraction procedures ( traced and binned the spectrum , calibrated wavelength ) .",
    "the procedure to determine the physical parameters of hd  69686 is similar to that used in our previous studies of cluster b stars @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 value was derived by fitting synthetic model profiles of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , using realistic physical models of rotating stars ( considering roche geometry and gravity darkening ) .",
    "the details of this step are described in @xcite .",
    "the best fit of @xmath12 is illustrated in figure  1 . with @xmath11 at hand",
    ", we then determined both the effective temperature ( @xmath14 ) and gravity ( @xmath15 ) of the star by fitting the h@xmath16 profile ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the best fit of the h@xmath16 profile is shown in figure  2 . by shifting the best fit profiles in wavelength to match the observations we also obtained an accurate radial velocity of each night s spectrum .",
    "the radial velocities were transformed into the heliocentric frame by removing the orbital motion of the earth ( using the rvcorrect function in iraf ) , and these velocities are given in table  1 .",
    "we do not see any significant change in the radial velocity between the two nights that is larger than the errors ( 6 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "even if hd  69686 were a long period , spectroscopic binary system , any orbital velocity variations will be small compared to its radial velocity .",
    "thus , we adopted the mean of the radial velocities in table  1 as the systemic radial velocity of hd  69686 for later analysis ( table  2 ) . for a rotating star such as hd  69686 , the derived gravity ( @xmath15 ) represents an average of gravity over its visible hemisphere .",
    "it may not be a good indicator of evolutionary status of the star because the effective gravity on the equatorial region is lowered by centrifugal force induced by stellar rotation .",
    "instead , we use the gravity at the poles of the star ( @xmath17 ) to estimate the age of the star since the @xmath17 value is not significantly influenced by rotation .",
    "the method to estimate @xmath17 is described in @xcite and has been applied to many of our studies on the evolution of b stars @xcite . based on our",
    "model simulation results @xcite , except for those extreme cases where the stars spin at or very close to the breakup velocity , the estimations of @xmath17 are quite accurate ( the statistical errors are 0.03 dex or less ) .",
    "we need one additional step to correct @xmath14 and @xmath15 derived from the h@xmath16 fit .",
    "we noticed that we had to use a model with much higher temperature ( 16200k ) to fit the @xmath12 line while our h@xmath16 line fit suggests that the effective temperature of hd  69686 should be around 14500k .",
    "this discrepancy implies that hd  69686 is a helium strong star .",
    "when we use models with solar abundances ( h : he@xmath180.9:0.1 ) to synthesize the h@xmath16 profile and to fit the observed spectrum of a he - peculiar star , we get systematic errors in the derived parameters ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the systematic errors can be corrected using the results given by @xcite who used the same technique to determine the photospheric parameters .",
    "the correction procedure was done in an iterative manner .",
    "we first determine the he abundance using the derived @xmath14 and @xmath15 values , then correct @xmath14 and @xmath15 based on the he abundance according to table  3 of @xcite .",
    "we then determine the he abundance again with the updated @xmath14 and @xmath15 values , and repeat the steps until convergence is reached . at the end , we obtained the final corrected @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( listed in table  2 ) for hd  69686 , with abundances typical of a he - strong star , with a number ratio of h : he@xmath19 .",
    "the best available parallax and proper motion data of hd  69686 come from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite .",
    "however , the parallax measurement , @xmath20 mas ( 1@xmath21 range : 341@xmath10565 pcs ) , is still too uncertain to provide us with an accurate tangential velocity for tracing the star s trajectory in space .",
    "we have to find an alternative method to obtain a reliable distance of the star .",
    "our method is described as follows : 1 ) by comparing the derived @xmath14 and @xmath17 of hd  69686 with evolutionary tracks of stellar models @xcite , we can estimate its stellar mass ; 2 ) we then can calculate the stellar radius from the mass and @xmath17 ; 3 ) from the radius and surface temperature , we can calculate the true luminosity of the star ( we considered a distorted shape of a rotating star in this step , see details below ) ; 4 ) with the true luminosity and the @xmath22 magnitude of the star , we can derive the distance for assumed values of extinction and bolometric correction . the @xmath23 color index from the _ hipparcos / tycho _ catalogue ( esa 1997 ) is @xmath240.15@xmath250.01 which is basically no different from the zero - reddening color of a star with temperature of 14,800  k. thus",
    ", we can safely set @xmath26 in the last step .",
    "the bolometric correction data we used here are from @xcite . finally , we estimated the age of the star from its mass and polar gravity by comparing with the non - rotating theoretical models by @xcite .",
    "the whole procedure was also repeated with other denser model grids by @xcite,@xcite , and @xcite , and we found no noticeable difference in the derived parameters between these model grids .",
    "all the derived parameters are listed in table  2 .",
    "@xcite and , more recently , @xcite ( eks models , hereafter ) have predicted that , due to rotationally induced mixing , fast rotating stars may evolve on ms tracks quite differently from non - rotating stars .",
    "fresh hydrogen can be brought down to the core due to rotationally induced mixing and make rotating stars have a longer ms lifetime .",
    "to investigate the difference in ages between rotating and non - rotating stars , we calculated the ages of the rotating models with various spin rates at a fixed evolutionary status ( at @xmath27 ) .",
    "we choose the 3 @xmath28 model ( the rotating model with mass closest to hd 69686 ) from eks models .",
    "the result is given in table  3 .",
    "as expected , fast rotating stars are evolving more slowly than slow- or non - rotating stars with the same mass in term of surface gravity at poles .",
    "as shown in table  3 , a very fast rotating star with @xmath29 probably takes 20% more time than a non - rotating star to reach @xmath27 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that hd  69686 is a rotating star with a moderate @xmath11 value ( @xmath30 km  s@xmath2 ) . because of the centrifugal force on its surface , the projected disk of hd  69686 on the sky is not perfectly round , and the projected angular area is expected to be slightly larger than @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the distance ) by a factor @xmath33 , which depends on the inclination angle @xmath34 . because we do not know the exact value of the inclination angle",
    ", we can only estimate it by averaging all possible values of @xmath34 .",
    "the range of @xmath34 is between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the breakup velocity of the star ( @xmath38 km  s@xmath2 for hd  69686 ) .",
    "we found the statistical mean of the acceptable inclination range is @xmath39 .",
    "if we assume that hd  69686 ( with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and , therefore , @xmath42 ) has an inclination of @xmath43 , then we obtain @xmath44 and @xmath45 from calculations based on simple roche geometry . with estimates in hand for the effective temperature and gravity",
    ", we can compare the observed and model spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of the star to determine its angular size , and then use our estimate of its physical size to derive a second determination of distance . in figure  3 , we plot the optical / ir flux points that are converted from the @xmath46 , @xmath22 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 magnitudes of the star and from the uv data from the esro td@xmath49 satellite @xcite .",
    "the fit between the calculated sed ( @xmath26 ) and photometry data is very good , and the normalization factor yields an equivalent , limb darkened angular diameter of @xmath50 mas . using the projection factor @xmath33 and polar radius given above , we arrive at a distance of @xmath51 pc , which is fully consistent with the spectroscopic distance derived earlier .",
    "we also apply our h@xmath16 fit method to a set of realistic models of hd 69686 to investigate more closely the difference between the statistically estimated @xmath17 and the true values of @xmath17 for models at various inclination angles .",
    "the model star has a mass of 4.42 @xmath28 . at different inclination angles ,",
    "we synthesize the h@xmath16 profiles by considering roche geometry ( controled by both rotational and gravitational potential on the surface ) and the gravity darkening effect ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we adjust @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the model stars for each inclination angle so that the measured values ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 from h@xmath16 fit ) always equal the values given in table  2",
    ". all results are given in table  4 , where we can see that the range of @xmath17 , @xmath57 , covers all inclination angles from @xmath58 down to @xmath59 .",
    "below @xmath59 ( i.e. , @xmath60 km  s@xmath2 ) , the model star spins close to the critical speed ( around @xmath61 ) .",
    "because of low probability that the star rotates with higher @xmath62 ( @xmath63 km  s@xmath2 ) @xcite and because the corresponding inclination range is narrow ( @xmath64 ) , the chance of hd 69686 spinning at a low inclination angle and having a higher @xmath17 beyond the range of @xmath57 is low .",
    "even if hd 69686 does spin at a low inclination angle , its age would be older than that its polar gravity implies because it rotates much faster than at a high inclination angle ( see table  3 ) . in this numerical simulation",
    ", we have also checked the projected area of the models on sky .",
    "we found that the projected area of the models at all investigated inclination angles are basically same ( different within @xmath65% ) .",
    "as the inclination angle goes lower , the @xmath33 factor gets bigger .",
    "meanwhile the model star rotates faster and faster ( increasing @xmath62 ) . in order to keep the measured @xmath15 constant",
    ", we have to lower the polar radius , @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the net effect is that the projected area on the sky , @xmath31 multiplied by @xmath33 , stays almost unchanged .",
    "in other words , it is safe to derive the distance using the projected area at one inclination angle .",
    "it should be noted that , as we were deriving the surface @xmath15 of hd 69686 from h@xmath16 profile fit , we did not consider possible systematic errors in the synthesized profiles .",
    "our synthesis code took the specific intensity profile data generated by synspec43 , which is using the vcs theory @xcite .",
    "if the systematic error causes an underestimation of surface gravity , @xmath15 , by 0.1 dex or more , hd 69686 might be younger than we estimate above , and could be born on the galactic plane ( see section 4 ) .",
    "many previous studies @xcite have pointed out that some old evolved objects in the halo , lying on a post - horizontal branch ( phb ) or a post - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) , could have similar atmospheric parameters ( temperature and gravity ) as young massive ob stars of population i. could hd  69686 be an old phb or pagb halo object with the same @xmath14 and @xmath15 values listed in table  2 ?",
    "one key difference between the old blue halo objects and the young ob disk stars is that the former have much lower mass ( @xmath66 1@xmath28 ) .",
    "if hd  69686 had a mass lower than @xmath67 , then for its observed gravity , it would have a small radius and a distance of less than 180  pc , which would yield a parallax more than 5@xmath21 higher than the hipparcos parallax ( @xmath20 mas ) .",
    "thus , we are confident that hd  69686 is a young , massive , main sequence b star instead of an old blue halo star with similar atmospheric parameters .",
    "now we have very accurate information that we list in table  2 about the position and the space velocity of hd  69686 ( resolved into three orthogonal components relative to the sun : the radial velocity @xmath68 and the tangential velocity in the directions of increasing right ascension @xmath69 and declination @xmath70 for epoch j2000 ) .",
    "with help of a properly selected galactic potential model , we should be able to follow the motion of hd  69686 backward to its birthplace . among the many galactic models available in literature , we decided to choose the axisymmetric model proposed by @xcite ( their model 2 , db2 here after ) .",
    "their model mass distribution was constructed to meet the constraints imposed by all the high quality kinematical data that were available at that time .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is related to the potential by @xmath71 .",
    "we obtained both the potential and the acceleration data of the model in a format of 3d grids in space ( 0.1 kpc per step in @xmath72 and 0.01 kpc per step in @xmath73 ) , and we made a bilinear - interpolation in this grid to determine the acceleration at each time step .",
    "the star s true space velocity in the galactic potential field is its velocity relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr , hereafter ) , ( @xmath74,@xmath22,@xmath75 ) , plus the galactic circular velocity of lsr , ( 0 , @xmath76,0 ) . here @xmath77 ( @xmath78 kpc ) is the sun s distance to the galactic center @xcite , and @xmath79217 km  s@xmath2 is the circular velocity of db2 at @xmath77 ( very close to the iau recommended value , 220 km  s@xmath2 ) .    in order to trace the star s motion back in time , we use the reversed space velocity of hd  69686 , @xmath24(@xmath74,@xmath80,@xmath75 ) as the initial velocity .",
    "the initial location of hd  69686 in the galaxy is determined from its location relative to the sun and the galactic location of the sun , 8 kpc away from the galactic center @xcite and 8 pc above the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath81 first , and then moved the star a very small step assuming @xmath81 stays constant during this small move .",
    "we updated the star s velocity and acceleration at the end of each step . repeating this calculation until reaching the estimated age of the star ( actually reaching to the zero age of the star because we move back in time )",
    ", the integration follows the star back to its birthplace .",
    "the numerical errors of this integration depend on the size of each small step .",
    "we found that a step of 2 kyr is a good choice which results in only a very small difference ( @xmath66 1 pc ) from the integrated positions using a smaller step ( 1 kyr ) over 80 myr .",
    "the reconstructed trajectory of hd  69686 is plotted in figure  4 as a thick solid line .",
    "the dotted lines are those tracks that result by changing by 1  @xmath21 the space velocity component @xmath69 ( with the dominant velocity error , @xmath82 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "because of the very large peculiar velocity of hd  69686 , it has a non - circular orbital motion ( the circular orbit of the sun in the @xmath83 plane is plotted as a dashed line in fig .  4 for comparison ) .",
    "currently , hd  69686 is quickly passing through the solar neighborhood and moving away from the galactic center ( @xmath84 km  s@xmath2 ) . when we first derived @xmath74 , we suspected that this star might come from the very inner part of the galaxy .",
    "after the full trajectory was reconstructed , we realized that hd  69686 has traveled a very long distance across the galaxy before reaching its current location ( see the top panel of fig .",
    "the birthplace of hd  69686 is located in the outer part of the galaxy ( about 12 kpc from the galactic center , 4 kpc further out than the sun ) . at its birth",
    "( 73 myr ago ) , hd  69686 was more than 10  kpc away from the sun ( compared to its current distance of 380  pc ) .",
    "about 26.6 myr ago , hd  69686 reached its minimum distance from the galactic center ( @xmath85 kpc ) .",
    "@xcite studied more than 60 high galactic latitude b stars and he suggested that all the young population i b stars in his sample are likely ejected from the galactic plane . @xcite and @xcite found very similar results in their investigations of high - latitude blue objects .",
    "if the cause of the high peculiar velocity of hd  69686 is similar to other runaway ob stars , then its birthplace is expected to be in or very close to the galactic plane because star formation activities are very rare at places far from the plane .",
    "however , our calculated trajectory suggests that hd  69686 is an exception . in the lower panel of figure  4 , hd  69686 s projected trajectory on",
    "the @xmath86 plane clearly shows that it was located well below the galactic plane ( @xmath1 kpc ) 73 myr ago .",
    "today hd  69686 ( only 150 pc above the galactic plane ) is on its way plunging into the galactic plane ( @xmath87 km  s@xmath2 ) . moving backward in time , it reached the highest position of its trajectory ( 860 pc above the galactic plane ) 19.5 myr ago , and crossed the plane around 37 myr ago , thanks to the stronger gravitational force in the @xmath73 direction in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "however , further back in time , hd  69686 was below the galactic plane and further away from the galactic center , and , therefore , it experienced a weaker @xmath73-force .",
    "the @xmath73-force was so weak that the star s trajectory began 73 myr ago at a position well below the plane ( @xmath1 kpc ) and with a velocity approaching the plane ( @xmath88 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the errors in the velocity components and the age estimation of hd  69686 are not large enough to make the range of its possible birthplace extend to the galactic plane .",
    "the reconstructed trajectory of hd  69686 implies that hd  69686 might be born in a location with a particularly low density ( 1.8 kpc below the galactic plane and 12 kpc away from the galactic center ) , where star formation activity is expected to be very rare .",
    "of course , we assume here that hd  69686 is a single - star system .",
    "though our two consecutive night observations do not display any variation in radial velocity above the noise level , we can not completely rule out that hd  69686 is a binary system with a longer period ( @xmath89 days ) .",
    "the mass - transfer events that often occur in close binary systems could totally invalidate our age estimation based on single - star evolutionary tracks . if hd  69686 is in a binary system and was ejected from the galactic plane due to the supernova ( sn ) explosion of its companion , the explosion occured most likely about 37 myr ago when hd 69686 was crossing the galactic plane .",
    "the coordinates of the crossing position are @xmath90 pc , and the space velocity of hd  69686 at that moment is @xmath91 km  s@xmath2 while the galactic circular velocity at that location is @xmath92 km  s@xmath2 ( using db2 ) . then we can calculate hd 69686 s peculiar velocity ( i.e.  ejection velocity ) at that location , which is 192 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite investigated the relation between the ejection velocity , the mass loss during the sn explosion , and the current binary period . for hd 69686 with a long period ( @xmath93 days ) and a very high ejection velocity ( 192 km  s@xmath2 ) ,",
    "the equation ( 7 ) in @xcite suggests a very large sn mass loss ( @xmath94 ) , which is large for a binary containing a late b - type star .",
    "although the over - solar abundance of helium on hd 69686 s surface could be a result of past mass transfer in a close binary , it is not the only explanation because helium peculiar ( both rich and poor ) stars are quite common among young late b ( single ) stars @xcite .",
    "also , as described in following paragraphs , we found evidence indicating that hd 69686 seems to belong to a co - moving cluster that naturally explains its high peculiar velocity .",
    "all of these arguments suggest that hd 69686 does not belong to a binary system , and we can estimate its age using single star evolutionary tracks .    much effort has been invested in searching for young massive stars forming in situ in the halo @xcite .",
    "most of the blue halo objects examined in these studies are either ejected disk stars or old evolved stars ( phb or pagb ) .",
    "only a few stars are possible candidates of massive star formation in the halo .",
    "* and references therein ) summarized the observational evidence of star formation far from the galactic plane .",
    "one possible mechanism that can trigger star formation at such an unusual place is a collision between high velocity clouds ( hvc ) and/or galactic accretion fragments ( or tidal streams ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that early - type star formation can be triggered by `` cloudlet - cloudlet collisions occurring every @xmath95 yr '' in any particular high galactic latitude cloud , and the formation rate could be @xmath96 early - type stars every @xmath95 yr in the halo .",
    "later , @xcite suggested that the collisions between cloudlets within hvcs may occur less frequently than previously thought , and they derive a much lower star formation rate from the observational data .",
    "more recently , another mechanism of star formation in the halo was proposed by @xcite , i.e. , that the tidal force of a passing massive cluster ( such as a globular cluster ) can trigger star formation in high galactic latitude clouds .",
    "though the proposed mechanisms are different , they all suggest a common scenario that a group of stars should be formed together in situ in the halo .",
    "if this indeed is the case for hd  69686 , we expect to see a group of stars that share the same space velocity with and have the same age of hd  69686 .",
    "finding such co - moving stars would provide strong evidence to support their formation in situ in the halo .",
    "because hd  69686 has traveled a very long distance in 73 myr , it is expected that the co - forming stars , if they exist , would spread into a much larger space around the current position of hd  69686 due to the velocity dispersion in the original cluster .",
    "a dispersion of 10 km  s@xmath2 in original space velocity would cause the co - forming group spread into a volume of 750@xmath97 pc@xmath97 , i.e. , spread all over the sky as seen from the sun . to make the search viable , we limit our search range to the vicinity of the trajectory of hd  69686 .",
    "thus , our search will detect only a very small fraction of any co - moving stars whose space velocities are similar to that of hd  69686 .    to carry out this kind of search , we first need the projected trajectory of hd  69686 on the sky as a baseline .",
    "any co - moving objects are expected to be on or around this baseline and to have similar proper motions and radial velocities to the values of the nearest point on the trajectory .",
    "we calculated the projected positions of hd  69686 s trajectory on the sky every 0.05 myr between 0.5 myr in the past and 0.5 myr in the future .",
    "the results are given in table  5 and plotted in figure  5 .",
    "we used the catalogue of stars with high - proper motions ( v2 ) by @xcite to search for similar high proper motion stars .",
    "the search region ( about 2 degrees around the trajectory ) is indicated as a shadowed area in figure  5 .",
    "we found a total of 26 stars ( including hd  69686 ) from roughly 2000 high proper motion stars ( @xmath98 mas  yr@xmath2 ) in the search region .",
    "their proper motions ( in both ra and dec directions ) have differences of 15 mas  yr@xmath2 or less from the reference points on the trajectory of hd  69686 .",
    "all 25 stars other than hd  69686 are plotted in figure  5 as open or filled circles with their proper motions indicated by line segments .",
    "note that the proper motions illustrated in figure  5 are not aligned with the projected trajectory ( hd  69686 seems to move away from its own trajectory ) . the trajectory of hd  69686 in space ( fig .",
    "4 ) is a curve in the galactic potential field that differs from circular motion . in order to find the co - moving stars that move on a similar trajectory , we need to project the whole trajectory on the current sky",
    "this means that both the past and future parts of the trajectory of hd  69686 have to be projected on the present sky .",
    "however , hd  69686 s proper motion is related to projected positions on the sky at different moments , i.e. , the past - time positions on the past - time sky and the future positions on the future sky .",
    "this is different from their position in the present sky ( the solid line in fig .",
    "5 ) because of the sun s orbital motion in the galaxy . as the sun ( and earth )",
    "is moving at @xmath10220 km  s@xmath2 around the galactic center , the projected trajectory of hd  69686 ( the solid line ) will move downward ( and slightly to the left ) in figure  5 ( in the reverse direction of the solar circular motion , which is approximately parallel to galactic latitude ) .",
    "thus , although hd  69686 seems to move away from its projected trajectory on the sky , it actually stays on the trajectory because the projected trajectory is moving downward at the same time .",
    "having similar proper motions does not necessarily imply that these stars belong to a co - moving group .",
    "some foreground and background high proper motion stars can be mixed in .",
    "we can further sift these foreground / background stars out using the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the expected co - moving group .",
    "all members in the hd  69686 co - moving group are expected to have the same age ( @xmath1073 myr ) and a distance around 380 pc ( because we limit our search region in the vicinity of the trajectory whose distance is given in the last column of table  5 ) .",
    "a 70 myr isochrone ( for solar metallicity @xmath99 and @xmath100 age @xmath101 ) extracted from evolutionary models by @xcite is plotted in figure  6 assuming a distance of 380 pc and @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath102 magnitudes of all 26 stars were obtained from the 2mass catalogue @xcite and were transformed into the system of @xcite using formulaejmc/2mass / v3/transformations/ ] , @xmath103/0.983 $ ] and @xmath104 . from figure  6 , we can easily tell those foreground / background stars which fall far above or below the isochrone on the cmd . this step helped us to discard 13 out of 25 stars ( the 13 deleted objects are plotted as open circles in fig .  5 and fig .  6 ) .",
    "the remaining 12 stars plus hd 69686 are the final candidates of the high velocity co - moving group ( plotted as filled circles in fig .  5 and fig .",
    "the key parameters of the final candidates are listed in table  6 .",
    "however , we can not be sure that all these 12 stars co - move with hd  69686 because we do not have the radial velocity data for them yet .",
    "new spectroscopic observations of these stars are planned in the near future .",
    "if some of the 12 stars are confirmed to co - move with hd  69686 by the follow up observation in the future , then we can rule out a runaway origin for hd  69686 because the mechanisms of generating runaways can not account for the ejection of a group of stars in a common direction .",
    "instead , the existence of a co - moving group would support the idea that the massive star formed in situ in the halo ( most likely in a hvc or galactic merger fragment ) with other stars 73 myr ago .",
    "the trajectory of hd  69686 covers a large range in all dimensions of the galactic potential field ( @xmath105 kpc in @xmath72 , @xmath106 kpc in @xmath73 , and almost @xmath107 of galactic azimuth ) .",
    "its shape may depend on the selection of different galactic models .",
    "we did calculate the trajectory using different models @xcite and found similar results with trivial differences that are too small to change our analysis results .",
    "all the models used in our calculations assume a similar circular velocity at a distance to galactic center of 8  kpc ( @xmath108 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "we note that some observations @xcite suggest that the circular motion of the solar neighborhood is faster than 220 km s@xmath2 by 30@xmath1040 km s@xmath2 .",
    "although it will be very interesting to see how much the trajectory of hd  69686 would change in a galactic model characterized by a larger rotation speed at the solar circle , it is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we thank our referee , dr philip dufton , very much for his careful reading and constructive comments on our paper .",
