    "the last few years have witnessed the birth of a new movement of interest and research in the study of complex networks as an interdisciplinary subject @xcite .",
    "this flurry of activity , triggered by two ground - breaking papers by watts and strogatz on small - world networks @xcite and barabsi and albert on scale - free networks @xcite , has been certainly induced by the increased computing powers and by the possibility to study the properties of a plenty of large databases of real - life networks , such as internet , world wide web , metabolic networks , protein networks in the cell , co - author networks and citation networks .",
    "these networks have been identified and analyzed in the literature , the emphasis being mostly on the three basic topological characteristics , such as power - law degree distribution , small average path length ( apl ) and high clustering coefficient @xcite .",
    "however , the above mentioned three properties do not provide sufficient characterizations of the real - world systems . in fact , it has been observed that real networks exhibit ubiquitous degree correlations among their nodes  @xcite .",
    "this translates in the observation that the degrees of nearest neighbor nodes are not statistically independent but mutually correlated in most real - life networks .",
    "correlations play an important role in the characterization of network topology , and have led to a first classification of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "they are thus a very relevant issue , especially in view of the important consequences that they can have on dynamical processes taking place on networks  @xcite .",
    "recently , based on the well - known apollonian packing , deterministic apollonian network ( dan )  @xcite and random apollonian network ( ran )  @xcite , called jointly apollonian networks ( ans ) were proposed , which have been generalized to high dimension  @xcite .",
    "ans are simultaneously scale - free , small - world , euclidean ( i.e. it can be embedded in an euclidean lattice  @xcite ) , space filling , and with matching graphs ( that is to say , in the infinite network size limit , the edges do not only completely cover the space like a peano curve , but also never cross each other ) .",
    "they may provide valuable insight into the real - life networks , e.g. the maximal planarity  @xcite of ans is of particular practicability for the layout of printed circuits .",
    "moreover , ans describe force chains in polydisperse granular packings and could also be applied to the geometry of fully fragmented porous media , hierarchical road systems , and area - covering electrical supply networks  @xcite .",
    "particularly , dan can be helpful to understand the energy landscape networks  @xcite .",
    "very recently , ans have attracted increasing interest from the scientific community  @xcite , some interesting dynamical processes , such as percolation , epidemic spreading , synchronization and random walks taking place on ran have been investigated .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the correlation properties of nodes connectivity of random apollonian network ( ran )  @xcite . combining a rate equation  @xcite in the continuous degree approximation and the boundary condition  @xcite of this rate equation",
    ", we work out analytically the two node correlations in ran , measured by the average nearest - neighbor degree ( annd ) of nodes with degree @xmath1 .",
    "then , using the genuine discrete degree distribution , we obtain the exact analytical result of mean clustering coefficient , which is the average value of three node correlations .",
    "both the analytical expressions are in very good agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "the random apollonian network ( ran )  @xcite is the stochastic version of the deterministic apollonian network ( dan )  @xcite .",
    "the construction of dan begins with ( @xmath2 ) a triangle and at each time step a new node is connected to the nodes of every existing triangles , omitting those triangles that had already been updated in previous steps . in the random version",
    "the triangles to be updated are selected at random , one at a time .",
    "we call the triangles to be updated _ active triangles_.    here we focus on the random apollonian network ( ran )",
    ". some properties of the ran have been investigated @xcite .",
    "the average degree of all its nodes equals 6 .",
    "it has a power - law degree distribution @xmath3 , and since each new node induces the addition of three triangles , one expects that the ran has a finite clustering coefficient .",
    "it has been proved that the increasing tendency of average path length of ran is a little slower than the logarithm of the number of nodes in ran .    for the sake of the following investigation on correlations in ran",
    ", we first revisit the degree distribution of ran .",
    "since the network size is incremented by one with each time step , we use the step value @xmath4 to represent a node created at this step . note that at time @xmath4 there are @xmath5 active triangles in ran , and the number of active triangles containing a node with degree @xmath1 is also equal to @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the average number of nodes with degree @xmath1 at time @xmath4 .",
    "when a new node enters the network , @xmath6 changes as @xcite @xmath7 in the asymptotic limit @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the degree distribution .",
    "( [ sf rate ] ) leads to the following recursive equation @xmath10 giving @xmath11 in the limit of large @xmath1 , @xmath12 @xcite , which has the same degree exponent as the ba model @xcite and the hierarchical lattice @xcite .",
    "this obtained degree distribution is a more accurate result than the previous one @xcite .",
    "notice that the growing precess of ran actually contains the preferential attachment mechanism , which arises in it not because of some special rule including a function of degree as in ref .",
    "@xcite but naturally .",
    "indeed , the probability that a new node created at time @xmath4 will be connected to an existing node @xmath13 is clearly proportional to the number of active triangles containing @xmath13 , i.e. to its degree @xmath14 .",
    "thus a node @xmath13 is selected with the usual preferential attachment probability @xmath15=k_i(t)/(2t+1 ) \\sim k_i(t)/2t$ ] ( for large @xmath4 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath16 satisfies the dynamical equation @xcite @xmath17 considering the initial condition @xmath18 , we have @xcite @xmath19 equation ( [ connect ] ) shows that the degree of all nodes evolves the same way , following a power law as in the well - known ba networks  @xcite .",
    "having obtained the exact degree distribution of the random apollonian networks ( ran ) , we now study the two and three node correlations in ran , which are merely two specific types of correlations .",
    "we ignore the long - range and multinode correlations , since the empirical data and theoretic research on such correlations is also absent .",
    "two node correlations in a network can be conveniently measured by means of the quantity , called _ average nearest - neighbor degree _ ( annd ) , which is a function of node degree , and is more convenient and practical in characterizing degree - degree correlations .",
    "the annd is defined by @xcite @xmath20 if there are no two degree correlations , @xmath21 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath22 increases ( or decreases ) with @xmath1 , the network is is said to be assortative ( or disassortative )  @xcite .",
    "we can analytically compute the function value of @xmath21 for the ran .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the sum of the degrees of the neighbors of node @xmath13 , evaluated at time @xmath4 .",
    "it is represented as @xmath24 where @xmath25 corresponds to the set of neighbors of node @xmath13 .",
    "the average degree of nearest neighbors of node @xmath13 at time @xmath4 , @xmath26 , is then given by @xmath27 . during the growth of the ran",
    ", @xmath23 can only increase by the addition of a new node connected either directly to @xmath13 , or to one of the neighbors of @xmath13 . in the first case",
    "@xmath23 increases by 3 ( the degree of the newly created node ) , while in the second case it increases by one unit .",
    "therefore , in the continuous @xmath1 approximation @xcite , we can write down the following rate equation  @xcite : @xmath28 + \\sum_{j \\in ( v)(i ) }    \\pi_{j } [ k_j(t ) ]   = \\frac{3 k_i(t)}{2 t } + \\frac{r_i(t)}{2 t } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the general solution of eq .",
    "( [ dri ] ) is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is determined by the boundary condition @xmath31 . to obtain the boundary condition @xmath31",
    ", we observe that at time @xmath13 , the new node @xmath13 is connected to an existing node @xmath32 of degree @xmath33 with probability @xmath34 $ ] , and that the degree of this node increase by one unit in the process .",
    "thus , @xmath35 [ k_j(i)+1 ] .",
    "\\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] inserting @xmath36=\\frac{k_j(i)}{2i}$ ] and @xmath37 into @xmath31 leads to @xmath38 so , in the large @xmath13 limit , @xmath39 is dominated by the second term , yielding @xmath40 from here , we have @xmath41 and finally @xmath42 so , two node correlations do not depend on the degree .",
    "the annd grows with the network size @xmath43 as @xmath44 , in the same way as in the ba model @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to confirm the validity of the obtained analytical prediction of annd , we performed extensive numerical simulations of the ran ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . to reduce the effect of fluctuation on simulation results , the simulation results are average over fifty network realizations . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we observe that for large @xmath1 the annd of numerical and analytical results are in agreement with each other , while the simulated results of annd of small @xmath1 have a very weak dependence on @xmath1 , which is similar to the phenomena observed in the ba model @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1 dependence , for small degree , can not be detected by rate equation approach , since it has been formulated in the continuous degree @xmath1 approximation .     as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : knnba ] ) .",
    "all data are from the average of 50 independent runs.,width=340 ]    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : knnba ] ) , we can also easily know that the evolution of annd of all nodes is the same , showing a weak logarithmic divergence with evolution time ( network size ) . to confirm this analytical prediction we also perform numerical simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we report the numerical results , which are in good agreement with this prediction provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : knnba ] ) .",
    "three node correlations can be measured by means of the conditional probability @xmath45 that a node of degree @xmath1 is simultaneously connected to nodes with degree @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the direct evaluation of the @xmath45 is generally difficult . to overcome this problem , another interesting alternative quantity ,",
    "i.e. clustering coefficient , is frequently used . by definition",
    ", the clustering coefficient  @xcite of nodes with degree @xmath1 , @xmath48 , is defined as the probability that two neighbors of a node with degree @xmath1 are also neighbors themselves .",
    "the average clustering coefficient of the whole network is then given as @xmath49 now we analytically estimate the average clustering coefficient @xmath50 of ran by means of the clustering spectrum @xmath48 . in the ran , for a node of degree @xmath1 , the exact value of its clustering coefficient is  @xcite @xmath51 which depends on degree @xmath1 . for large @xmath1 ,",
    "the degree - dependent clustering @xmath48 is inversely proportional to degree @xmath1 , the same behavior has been analytically found in some growing network models such as deterministic ( random ) pseudofractal scale - free networks and their variants @xcite , as well as some real systems @xcite .",
    "( [ acc1 ] ) , the average clustering coefficient @xmath50 of ran can be easily obtained as the mean value of @xmath48 with respect to the degree distribution @xmath9 expressed by eq .",
    "( [ degree ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we now compute in detail @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "first , we can decompose @xmath55 into the sum of four terms as @xmath57 analogously to eq .",
    "( [ ac1 ] ) , we get @xmath58 where we have used the fact that @xmath59 . substituting eqs .",
    "( [ ac1 ] ) and ( [ ac2 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ acc2 ] ) , we have @xmath60 thus the average clustering coefficient @xmath50 of ran is large and independent of network size .",
    "since eqs .",
    "( [ degree ] ) , ( [ ck ] ) , ( [ ac1 ] ) , and ( [ ac2 ] ) are exact , it is the same with the obtained @xmath50 value .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical simulations of the ran . in fig .",
    "[ clu ] , we present the simulation results about the average clustering coefficient of ran , which are in complete agreement with the analytical value .    it should be mentioned that previous jobs  @xcite have studied the average clustering coefficient of ran , using continuum approximation and integral methods , and have acquired a analytical value of @xmath61 . from fig .",
    "[ clu ] , we can see that there is a difference between this analytical value and simulated ones .",
    "where does the difference come from ? and why eq .",
    "( [ acc3 ] ) is more accurate ? these might be explained as follows . in ran ,",
    "a node may have only an integer number of connections ( degrees ) .",
    "the continuum approach used previously  @xcite is under the assumption that the degree distribution @xmath9 is modeled by the continuous distribution @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , where @xmath64 is a normalization constant .",
    "it does not properly account for the fraction ( i.e. degree distribution ) of nodes with small degrees  @xcite , and therefore has a discrepancy with the exact result for ran with the genuine discrete degree distribution @xmath65 expressed by eq .",
    "( [ degree ] ) [ see fig .",
    "[ clu ] ] .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that ( a ) @xmath66 and @xmath65 are equal , asymptotically , in the limit of large @xmath1 and ( b ) the difference is most pronounced for @xmath67 .",
    "the discrepancy is mainly due to the values of @xmath9 for small @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the discrete method , omitting a continuum assumption , seems more suitable for obtaining exact results for some challenging tasks  @xcite .     of ran vs the network size @xmath68 .",
    "the solid line shows the exact result @xmath69 , while the dashed line depicts the previous analytic value @xmath70 .",
    "the squares denote the results of simulations .",
    "each data is obtained by fifty independent network realizations.,width=340 ]",
    "in this article , we have done an analytical study of the correlations between the degrees of neighboring nodes in random apollonian networks ( ran ) . applying rate equation method in the continuous @xmath1 approximation , together with its boundary condition that node @xmath13 was added to the system at time @xmath13 with the expected sum of degrees of its neighbors being @xmath71 , we have provided the solution of the average degree of nearest neighbors as the measure of two degree correlations .",
    "the obtained result shows that ran lacks two degree correlations , which means that the annd of nodes with degree @xmath1 is independent of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we have obtained the exact degree distribution of ran , on the basis of which we have attained the exact value of mean clustering coefficient as an average quantity of three node correlations .",
    "we found that ran are highly clustered , and the clustering spectrum scales as @xmath72 , exhibiting hierarchical organization and modularity .",
    "these obtained structure properties may be helpful to understand and explain the workings of systems built on ran .",
    "many physical processes , such as disease spread and random walks , taking place in ran exhibit different behaviors than those in the classic ba networks , which are relevant to these particular topologies of ran  @xcite .",
