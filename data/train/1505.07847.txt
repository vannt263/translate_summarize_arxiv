    "( [ eq15 ] ) brings us to @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( [ eq24 ] ) , which can be easily transformed to the controlled - z form as described in the previous paragraphs .",
    "because the small rotations arising from the off - diagonal part of @xmath16 are specific for each @xmath12 zero of @xmath122 , we do not calculate them here .",
    "the theory of quantum circuits includes two types of operations , local and nonlocal . at the heart of it",
    "are nonlocal two - qubit operations because they produce quantum entanglement .",
    "local operations play an auxiliary role .",
    "the cnot gate is a paradigmatic nonlocal gate because it is universal and allows performing arbitrary rotations in multiqubit systems .",
    "the controlled - z gate is equivalent to cnot , from this point of view , because the two gates differ from each other only by local rotations ( two hadamard rotations ) .",
    "because nonlocal operations critically depend on interqubit coupling , which is relatively weak in many realizations , the efficiency of these operations may be a limiting factor in the speed of quantum computation .",
    "thus , it is helpful to see how to most efficiently employ the available interqubit couplings to perform any desired two - qubit operation .",
    "an important example is the exchange - only coded qubit , where information is encoded in a two - dimensional subspace with @xmath257 , within the eight - dimensional low - energy hilbert space for the three participating electron spins . since",
    "single qubit operations are implemented by exchange coupling in these systems , they can be performed quite rapidly . if two - qubit coupling is also implemented by exchange , however , the spin quantum numbers of individual qubits will not be conserved , and the system will not generally remain in the coding hilbert space .",
    "then , to rectify this , one is forced to implement a complicated series of at least 15 non - local operations , interspersed with local operations,@xcite all of which take time and can easily lead to errors . by contrast , if the interqubit couplng is mediated only by the coulomb interaction between electrons in different qubits , the spin quantum numbers of each qubit are conserved by this interaction .",
    "therefore , if one can neglect perturbations such as spin - orbit coupling and hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins , the qubits will remain in their coding spaces , and complicated remedial steps will not be necessary .",
    "thus , it may be highly advantageous to use capacitive coupling based on the coulomb interactions , even though it is weaker than exchange coupling and the coupling time for a single step will be longer .",
    "in this paper we have explored the issue of whether it is possible , in general , to execute a perfect cnot ( or controlled - z ) gate with a single time interval of capacitive coupling between the two qubits . in general , there will be four parameters , denoted by @xmath258 , which describe this capacitive coupling , whose values may be fixed by geometrical constraints , and may be difficult to vary independently . here",
    "we have assumed that the couplings may be turned on and off sharply but that their on - values , and the ratios between them , are fixed by the geometry .",
    "we have found that for a wide range of the coupling parameters , a perfect cnot gate is indeed possible , provided we choose appropriately the single qubit exchange splittings @xmath2 and @xmath3 as well as the time @xmath4 that the coupling is turned on .",
    "in fact , we have found in each case that there is a countably infinite set of triplets @xmath5 that satisfy the criteria .",
    "we have also discussed , in some detail , how the precise values of @xmath5 vary as one varies the assumed ratio between the four capacitive coupling constants , and in special cases , we have found the local rotations necessary to complete a controlled - z operation .    although we have focused on exchange - only spin qubits , other applications may also be considered .",
    "mathematically , our considerations should apply to any system of qubits where the coupling can be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , to a good approximation , and there is a single qubit splitting of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .    as a specific example",
    ", one may consider a system of @xmath259 qubits , where the coding qubit states are linear combinations of a singlet state and a triplet state with @xmath260 , for two electrons in a double quantum dot . in order to perform the full array of single qubit operations ,",
    "it is necessary to create a local magnetic field gradient , so that electrons in the two dots see different magnetic fields .",
    "if the magnetic field on both dots is in the same direction , and if we can neglect effects such as spin - orbit coupling and transverse components of the nuclear overhauser field , then capacitive coupling between two qubits will conserve @xmath1 for each qubit separately , so the system will remain inside the coding subspace .",
    "thus there would be a possibility to perform an exact cnot gate in this system in a similar fashion to the case of exchange - only qubits .",
    "calderon - vargas and kestner have in fact considered this possibility in a recent work,@xcite and have shown numerically , that exact cnot gates can be achieved with a single interval of non - local coupling by adjusting three parameters , the coupling time and the voltage bias on each of the two qubits , in several examples .",
    "the mathematical examples considered in this paper have assumed that the interqubit coupling constants can be turned on and off instantaneously .",
    "a more realistic scenario would be a case where the coupling is turned on and off over a time interval @xmath261 that is short compared to the coupling duration @xmath4 . according to our understanding of the analytic structure of the problem",
    ", this should not affect our basic results . specifically ,",
    "if @xmath262 is sufficiently small , there should still exist triplets @xmath5 for which the makhlin invariants _ exactly _ satisfy the criteria for an exact cnot gate , though the values will be displaced from the solutions for @xmath263 . if @xmath262 becomes too large , however , pairs of solutions may come together and disappear .",
    "we conjecture that a necessary condition for the existence of exact solutions might be that @xmath264 and @xmath265 be small compared to unity .",
    "calculations presented in ref .   have indeed shown the possiblity of achieving exact cnot gates in a protocol with a finite time @xmath262 for turning on and off the control voltages , in the case of @xmath259 qubits .",
    "an assumption , in all of our models , is that we could confine ourselves to a low energy - hilbert space with two states for each qubit .",
    "this assumption can be justified provided there is a large energy gap @xmath266 to all other states with the same conserved quantum numbers as the desired qubit states , and provided variations of the coupling constants are always adiabatic compared to @xmath267 . in the present case , this means we must have @xmath268 .",
    "although , generically , the conditions for a cnot gate will no longer be satisfied exactly when higher energy states are taken into account , we expect that errors can be made arbitrarily small , for large enough @xmath266 , as errors due to non - adiabaticity should fall off faster than any power of @xmath269 .",
    "the possibility to perform cnot gates of arbitrary perfection using a single interval of capacitive coupling , giving a huge decrease in the number of nonlocal operations relative to the case of exchange coupling , sounds highly promising .",
    "this calls for new efforts in enhancing and better control of capacitive interqubit coupling .",
