    "recent cosmological observations agree remarkably with standard @xmath3cdm models . the one and three - year data of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observation determined the cosmological parameters to high precision  @xcite .    in light of such recent progress of cosmological observations",
    ", it has been shown that the universe should be close to flat , and most of the matter must be in the form of non - baryonic dark matter , which has been originally considered as one of the best candidates to explain an anomaly in the rotational curves of galaxies .    in extension of the standard model explaining electroweak symmetry breaking and stability of the hierarchy , several candidates of the particle dark matter have been proposed such as the neutralino  @xcite , the gravitino  @xcite , the axino  @xcite in supersymmetric theory , branon dark matter  @xcite , kaluza klein dark matter  @xcite and little higgs dark matter  @xcite and so on .",
    "the searches and the detailed studies of the dark matter have become one of the most exciting aspects of near future collider experiments and cosmological observations .",
    "considering such candidates in particle physics models , we expect the large amount of the dark matter particle will be produced at the near future colliders  @xcite , which will be powerful tools to understand the properties of the dark matter  @xcite . on the other hand , cosmological observations may provide information in new particle physics models , and even some implications on undetectable theoretical parameters in the collider experiments .",
    "thus the connection of cosmology to collider physics may provide wide possibilities to understand the properties of the dark - matter particle and check the cosmological models themselves .    at the present stage , the detailed properties of the dark matter is still unknown . therefore , even exotic properties might be allowed .",
    "future observations / experiments may prove them and single out or constrain dark - matter candidates . even now , some problems in cosmological observations may already show some hints to understand the unknown properties of dark matter e.g. , in the small scale structure problem  @xcite indicated in the cold dark matter halo , the low @xmath0li problem  @xcite and so on .",
    "there are several proposals to solve them by new physics  @xcite",
    ". however , considerable astrophysical uncertainties may still exist .    during the radiation dominated epoch",
    "well before the decoupling of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , it is not necessary that the dominant component of matter is neutral , and that relic is the same as the present one . for stable charged massive particles ( champs )  @xcite ,",
    "their fate in the universe had been discussed  @xcite , and the searches for champs inside the sea water were performed  @xcite , which obtained null results and got constraints on stable champs  @xcite . according to their results , the production of stable champs at future collider experiments is unlikely .",
    "however , such null results can be applied only for the stable champs , and still the window for long - lived champs with a mass below o(tev ) is left open .",
    "such possibilities for the long - lived champs were well - motivated in a scenario of super weakly interacting massive particle ( superwimp ) dark matter  @xcite , which may inherit the desired relic density through the long - lived champ decays .",
    "the dominant component of the nonrelativistic ( nr ) matter during / after the bbn epoch might be charged particles . in supersymmetric theories , such a situation",
    "is naturally realized in gravitino lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and axino lsp scenarios .",
    "then the candidate for the long - lived champ would be a charged scalar lepton  @xcite .",
    "trapping such long - lived champs , the detailed studies of long - lived charged particle will be possible in future collider experiments , which may be able to provide some nontrivial tests of underlying theories , like measurement on the gravitino spin , on the gravitational coupling in the gravitino lsp scenario  @xcite .",
    "the trapping method in cern lhc and international linear collider ( ilc ) has been performed in the context of supersymmetric theories  @xcite .",
    "also the collider phenomenology  @xcite and the other possible phenomena  @xcite have been discussed .    in cosmological considerations of such long - lived particles ,",
    "the effects on bbn by the late - time energy injection due to their decays have been studied in detail  @xcite . on the other hand , in the past studies of the effects on the light elements abundances ,",
    "the analysis were simply applied to long - lived charged massive particles , assuming all champs are ionized and freely propagating in the radiation dominated epoch well before the cmb decoupling .",
    "however , we show that these results are not always valid if the bound state with a champ and light elements may have o(mev ) binding energy  @xcite , and the bound state might be stable against the destruction by the scattering off the huge amount of the background photons even during the bbn epoch .",
    "also we show that heavier elements tend to be captured at earlier time .",
    "namely the heavier light elements such as @xmath4li or @xmath4be form their bound states earlier than the lighter light elements , d , t , @xmath2he and @xmath5he .",
    "such a formation of the bound state with a heavy champ may provide possible changes of the nuclear - reaction rates and the threshold energy of the reactions and so on , which might result in the change of the light element abundances .",
    "what is the crucial difference from the case of electron captures ? in case of the electron capture , since the bohr radius of an electron is much larger than the typical pion - exchange length o(1/@xmath6 ) , two nuclei feel the coulomb barrier significantly before they get close to each other . on the other hand , in the case of the capture of the champs , the bohr radius could be of the same order as the typical pion - exchange length .",
    "then , the incident charged nuclei can penetrate the weakened coulomb barrier , and the nuclear reaction occurs relatively rapidly .",
    "the importance of such a bound state in the nuclear reaction had been identified for cosmic muons  @xcite .    concerning a discrepancy in @xmath0li between the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) prediction by using the cmb baryon - to - photon ratio and the observational data , as we will show the details later , it is unlikely to attribute the discrepancy only to uncertainties in nuclear - reaction rates in sbbn  @xcite .",
    "however as we mentioned above , if champs exist , the nuclear reaction rates during the bbn epoch could be changed from the values known by experimental data or observations of the sun , and may potentially solve the current low @xmath0li / h problem .",
    "if such long - lived champs existed and affected the light element abundances , the lifetime would be long ( @xmath7 1sec ) .",
    "they may be discovered as long - lived heavily ionizing massive particles inside the detector in the collider experiments .",
    "the measurements of their lifetime and properties may provide new insights to understand not only the particle physics models but also the phenomena in the early universe in turn .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the possible change due to the long - lived champs during / after bbn epoch and consider the effects on bbn .",
    "the theory in sbbn has only one theoretical parameter , the baryon to photon ratio @xmath8 , to predict primordial light element abundances . comparing the theoretical predictions with observational data",
    ", we can infer the value of @xmath8 in sbbn .",
    "it is well known that this method had been the best evaluation to predict @xmath8 before wmap reported their first - year data of the cmb anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "wmap observations have determined @xmath8 in high precision . the value of @xmath8 reported by the three - year wmap observations  @xcite is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is number density of baryon , and @xmath11 is number density of the cosmic background photon . in fig",
    "[ fig : yield_sbbn ] we plot the theoretical prediction of the light element abundances with their 2 @xmath12 errors .",
    "the vertical band means the value of @xmath8 reported by the three - year wmap observations at 2 @xmath12 .",
    "we briefly discuss the current status of the theory of sbbn and the observational light element abundances below , and check the consistency with the cmb anisotropy observation .",
    "further details of the observational data are presented in a recent nice review by g. steigman  @xcite .",
    "the errors of the following observational values are at @xmath13 level unless otherwise stated .",
    "hereafter @xmath14 denotes the number density of a particle @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 denotes the bound state of champ with an element @xmath15 .",
    "the primordial abundance of d is inferred in the high redshift qso absorption systems .",
    "recently a new data was obtained at redshift @xmath17 toward q1243 + 3074  @xcite .",
    "combined with these data  @xcite , the primordial abundance is given as @xmath18 .",
    "it agrees excellently with the value of @xmath8 predicted in the cmb anisotropy observation .    the abundance of @xmath2he can increase and decrease through the chemical evolution history",
    "however , it is known that the fraction @xmath19 is a monotonically increasing function of the cosmic time  @xcite .",
    "therefore the presolar value is an upper bound on the primordial one , @xmath20  @xcite . in sbbn",
    "the theoretical prediction satisfies this constraint .",
    "the primordial abundance of @xmath5he is obtained from the recombination lines from the low - metallicity extragalactic hii region .",
    "the mass fraction of the @xmath5he is inferred by taking the zero metallicity limit as @xmath21 for the observational data  @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis by fields and olive obtained the following value by taking into account the effect of the hei absorption , @xmath22 , where the first and second errors are the statistical and systematic ones . on the other hand , izotov and thuan  @xcite reported a slightly higher value , @xmath23 where we have added the systematic errors following  @xcite .",
    "olive and skillman recently reanalyzed the izotov - thaun data  @xcite and obtained a much milder constraint  @xcite , @xmath24 . even if we adopted the more restrictive value in ref .",
    "@xcite , sbbn is consistent with cmb .",
    "for @xmath0li , it is widely believed that the primordial abundance is observed in pop ii old halo stars with temperature higher than @xmath256000k and with low metallicity as a `` spite s plateau '' value .",
    "the measurements by bonifacio et al .",
    "@xcite gave @xmath26|_{\\text{obs}}= -9.66 \\pm ( 0.056)_{\\rm stat } \\pm ( 0.06)_{\\rm sys}$ ] .",
    "on the other hand , a significant dependence of @xmath0li on the fe abundance in the low metallicity region was reported in  @xcite .",
    "if we take a serious attitude towards this trend , and assume that this comes from the cosmic - ray interaction  @xcite , the primordial value is @xmath27 even if we adopt the higher value in ref .",
    "@xcite , the theoretical prediction is excluded at 2 @xmath12 outside the outskirts of observational and theoretical errors .",
    "therefore when we adopt the lower value in ( [ eq : ryan_li7 ] ) , the discrepancy worsens .",
    "the centeral value of the observation is smaller than that of sbbn by a factor of about 3 .",
    "this @xmath0li problem has been pointed out by a lot of authors , e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been thought optimistically that this discrepancy would be astrophysically resolved by some unknown systematic errors in the chemical evolution such as the uniform depletion in the convective zone in the stars  .",
    "so far the researchers have added a large systematic errors into the observational constraint by hand  @xcite .",
    "however , recently the plateau structure of @xmath28li in nine out of 24 pop ii old halo stars was reported by asplund et al .",
    "the observed values of the isotope ratio @xmath29 uniformly scatter between @xmath30 0.01 and 0.09 at 2 @xmath12 , independently of the metallicity , and are approximately similar to the previous observational data ( @xmath31 at 2 @xmath12  @xcite ) . because the estimated @xmath4li abundance in such stars is @xmath32 , the upper bound on the primordial @xmath28li agrees with sbbn .",
    "although so far some models of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 production through the cosmic - ray spallation of cno and @xmath35-@xmath35 inelastic scattering have been studied , the predicted value of @xmath29 or @xmath36 is obviously an increasing function of a metallicity  @xcite .",
    "as we have discussed , to be consistent with the sbbn prediction and wmap observations , we need a certain uniform depletion mechanism of @xmath0li .",
    "because @xmath28li is more fragile than @xmath4li , whenever @xmath0li is destroyed in a star , @xmath28li suffers from the depletion , too .",
    "if we require the primordial abundance of @xmath0li to be uniformly depleted to a smaller value by a factor of three , the ratio @xmath28li/@xmath0li might have to be reduced by a factor of @xmath37(10 )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not have any successful chemical evolution models at the present , to consistently explain the observational value of @xmath28li/@xmath0li by starting from the theoretical prediction of the primordial values of @xmath28li and @xmath0li in the framework of sbbn .",
    "thus , by adopting the @xmath8 predicted in the cmb observations , we would now have to check sbbn itself or modified scenarios related with bbn compared with the observational light element abundances .",
    "in recent studies , it has been pointed out that the uncertainties on nuclear - reaction rates in sbbn never solve the discrepancy of @xmath0li between the theory and the observation .",
    "that is because the uncertainties are highly constrained by known experimental data and observations of the standard solar model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the possible nuclear uncertainties were investigated .",
    "it was shown that only a nuclear reaction rate more than 100 times larger in @xmath0be(n,@xmath35)@xmath5he and @xmath0be(d , p)2@xmath5he might provide sizeable change in the @xmath0li abundance .",
    "notice that @xmath0be(n,@xmath35)@xmath5he does not have an s - wave resonance due to the symmetry of the outgoing channel while @xmath0be(n , p)@xmath0li has it .",
    "since in the important energy region in the sbbn reaction @xmath38 50 kev , which is near threshold of the processes , the contribution to @xmath0be from @xmath0be(n,@xmath35)@xmath5he is negligible in sbbn relative to @xmath0be(n , p)@xmath0li because of the p - wave nature of the process . for @xmath0be(d , p)2@xmath5he , the possibility may not work in the light of the recent experimental data  @xcite .",
    "also cyburt et.al .",
    "@xcite discussed the uncertainties on the normalization of cross section for the process @xmath2he(@xmath35,@xmath39)@xmath0be and found that the uncertainties are constrained in the light of a good agreement between the standard solar model and solar neutrino data .",
    "therefore the remaining possibilities may be uncertainties on the chemical evolution of li from the bbn epoch to the present or effects due to new physics . because now we do not have any successful chemical evolution models",
    ", it must be important to consider the effect of new physics .",
    "as we mentioned before , the existence of champs might provide possible change of nuclear - reaction rates during the bbn epoch , which may have some impact on the prediction of primordial light element abundances . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the properties of the bound state and the recombination of champ and the possible change of nuclear reaction rates .",
    "we evaluate the binding energy for the bound state of a negatively charged massive particle and a light element .",
    "we simply consider the case that the charged particle is a scalar .",
    "the extension to a fermion or the other higher spin cases would be straightforward although there exist little differences . here",
    "we follow the way to evaluate the binding energy assuming uniform charge distribution inside the light element according to ref .",
    ". then the hamiltonian is represented by @xmath40 for short distances @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for long distances @xmath43 , where @xmath35 is the fine structure constant , @xmath44 1.2 @xmath45/  200@xmath46 is the nuclear radius , @xmath47 is the electric charge of the light element , and @xmath48 is the electric charge of the negatively charged massive particle .",
    "@xmath49 is the atomic number , and @xmath50 is the mass of the light element @xmath15 .",
    "here we assumed @xmath51(100 gev ) , which means the reduced mass @xmath52 .    for large nuclei , the exotic charged particle may be inside the nuclear radius .",

    "for @xmath57 , the coulomb model gives a good approximation .",

    "cols=\">,^,>,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have discussed the change of light element abundances before the decay of champs . on the other hand",
    ", the decaying champs might induce additional changes of primordial light element abundances , which have been studied by several groups .",
    "the effects highly depend on the decay products , i.e. , electromagnetic or hadronic cascades  @xcite .    at an earlier epoch before @xmath61sec , only the hadronic energy injection is important , and there is almost no constraint from em energy injections .",
    "therefore , at such an epoch , even though the injected energy is not small , if the branching ratio into hadronic cascade is sufficiently suppressed , there are no significant effects on the primordial light element abundances .",
    "such a case is well known if champs decay into leptons with a branching ratio into hadrons of the order of @xmath62(@xmath63)@xmath62(@xmath64 ) . for late decays after @xmath65 sec , the amount of energy release may be highly constrained by the em energy injections .    in the following sections , we consider possible new changes by taking into account the capture of champs .",
    "since the binding energy of champ bound states is below the nuclear binding energy of the light elements , the recoil of nucleons inside the captured light element due to champ decays would not destroy the light element . on the other hand",
    ", the decay products of the bound champ might directly hit the bound light element and destroy it .",
    "let us consider the case that the primary decay product is a charged lepton as an example .",
    "of course , if the lepton is a tau , the tau lepton soon decays into hadronic particles .",
    "however , the lifetime of a tau lepton is long enough to go through the bohr radius of the bound state .",
    "thus we will deal with all kinds of leptons in a similar fashion .",
    "naively we may speculate that the light elements are distributed inside the radius @xmath66 , and the champ stays somewhere inside the radius .",
    "then the number density of quarks ( or nucleons/ nuclei ) inside a bound nucleus is roughly , @xmath67 the mean free path is roughly estimated by @xmath68 where we have chosen @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mandelstam variable @xmath70 for the momentum transfer from a primary decay product ( a charged lepton ) to a bound light element .",
    "then , the naive probability of the primary decay product ( a charged lepton ) scattering off a quark ( or nucleon / nucleus ) inside the nucleus is @xmath71 \\left [ \\frac{a^{1/3}}{2 } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    among light elements , @xmath5he destruction would be most dangerous .",
    "if we assume that all of @xmath5he s are completely captured by champs , if such a probability is below @xmath72 , the change on d / h , @xmath2he / h abundances due to the direct collision will be below the @xmath73 level , which may not disagree with observed abundances .",
    "elements heavier than the destroyed parent nuclei should not be directly produced significantly.he which are produced from the destruction of the bound @xmath5he can nonthermally produce sizable amount of @xmath74li . ]",
    "we can find that , if the momentum transfer from primary decay - product is hard ( @xmath75)mev)@xmath76 may be below the typical threshold @xmath77(10 ) mev to destroy a bound light element by nr nucleon / nuclei scattering inside the light element .",
    "] , the light element bound by a champ is sufficiently transparent and may not disturb the sbbn prediction for elements lighter than @xmath5he . in this case , for the evaluation of the primary energy injection , past studies in the literature will be a good approximation , which considered that champs are freely propagating in a thermal bath . for the secondary products through the hadronization of a recoiled quark or direct production of nucleons / nuclei , the above probability will be identified as the hadronic branching ratio for a champ decay , which may provide only negligible effects on elements lighter than @xmath5he . on the other hand , we can consider another extreme case where the momentum transfer is sufficiently soft .",
    "for example , if the energy is smaller than the nuclear binding energy , the charged lepton of decay products could not inelastically scatter off the bound light element . in the middle range between them",
    ", we may have to simultaneously consider the direct collision and em / hadronic cascade induced by the late decay which was considered before .",
    "in the case of hadronic decays , we may replace @xmath35 by the strong coupling @xmath78 in the above estimation .",
    "then , we find that for a sufficiently hard momentum transfer @xmath79 , the bound light element is still transparent .",
    "there are three types of other possible effects on light element abundances by the late - time decaying champs when some fraction of such light elements are captured by champs .",
    "the first type originates from the change on the coulomb barrier and the kinematics of background light elements as targets for nonthermal processes by their own bound states .",
    "this change could be important for the hadronic - decay scenario .",
    "the injected high - energy hadrons eventually lose their energy due to the thermal interactions and become nonrelativistic and collide with the background light elements .",
    "if the target nuclei are captured by champs , the reaction rates for various hadronic processes might be different from experimental values .",
    "the second type is related to the change of the _ q _ value .",
    "this might be important for both high - energy hadronic and em energy injections , especially in high - energy photon injections .",
    "the injected high - energy photons produce many soft photons through the em cascade before the scattering off background light elements .",
    "then the spectrum of the soft photons has a cutoff at the energy above the threshold of electron - positron pair creation , which depends on the cosmic time or the cosmic temperature . only when the cutoff energy is higher than the threshold energy of the photodissociation are the target nuclei destroyed .",
    "the change in the _ q _ value may modify the epoch when the light element is destroyed by the photodissociation processes .",
    "the third type is related to neutron injection from late decays .",
    "if the decay occurs while some of the sbbn processes are still active , the high - energy hadronic injections might produce many neutrons . at late time",
    "( t @xmath7 100 sec ) , since neutrons have an extremely low abundance due to the @xmath80 decay , the produced neutrons can significantly affect the light element abundances because the related nuclear reactions do not have a coulomb suppression .",
    "the neutron injection at around @xmath81 sec was discussed as a solution to obtain low @xmath0be abundance by the destruction of sbbn @xmath0be through @xmath0be(n , p)@xmath0li and subsequently @xmath0li(p,@xmath35)@xmath5he  @xcite . in our scenario",
    ", there may exist some differences from the previous studies . as we mentioned before , in cbbn , @xmath0be(n,@xmath35)@xmath5he could be more important for the @xmath0be abundance than @xmath0be(n , p)@xmath0li because the center - of - mass energy in the process can be completely different from that of sbbn .",
    "thus the neutron injections from the late decaying champs may enhance the destruction ability of @xmath0be , and the effects could be different from the noncaptured case .",
    "notice also that there may still exist unknown errors even on the reaction rate of @xmath0be(n , p)@xmath0li with captured @xmath0be , as was discussed before .",
    "the modification of the reaction rate of @xmath2he(d , p)@xmath5he might be interesting with decaying champ scenario below 1kev .",
    "if a sizable fraction of d is captured and the reaction rate of the process is enhanced due to the capture of a champ , the destruction rate of @xmath2he might become more rapid than the production due to late decays of champs , which may weaken the bound on @xmath2he production due to the decay .",
    "this new possibility may relax the @xmath2he / d bound , which is generally the most severe constraint on radiatively or hadronically decaying massive - particle scenarios at @xmath82sec .    considering the above possibilities , it is important to reanalyze the effect of the late - time decaying champs in their bound states with the light elements  @xcite .",
    "if the cbbn prediction is not be significantly disturbed by late decays , the superwimp dark matter scenario would be interesting .",
    "here we discuss how much relic of champs might be allowed in this scenario .",
    "since the number density of champs is important to evaluate the capture rate of light element , we consider the possible constraints on the number density of champs , assuming that the whole dark matter originates from the two body decay of champs into a dark matter and a sm particle .",
    "we consider the free streaming by the whole dark matter produced from champ decays .",
    "the relic density of champ is @xmath83 as we found before , the capture rate is governed by the number density of the champ .",
    "@xmath84 hence the lighter mass of the dark - matter allows larger champ abundance .",
    "since kev warm dark matter is still allowed from ly@xmath35 data  @xcite , we naively require that the dark matter is nonrelativistic at @xmath85kev .",
    "then we find a following condition .",
    "@xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the three momentum of dark matter . assuming the two body decay ,",
    "the four velocity at the decay time is @xmath89 .",
    "then we find that , for lifetime @xmath90sec , @xmath91 may be allowed .",
    "then it is possible to take @xmath92 , which will lead to a considerable capture rate .    for the case that the decaying champs contribute only to part of the dark matter , or their contribution is negligible , the above constraint may not be applicable .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed the role of long - lived charged particle during / after the bbn epoch .",
    "we found that the existence of champ during the bbn epoch can change the light element abundances if the capture rate of champ by light elements is sufficiently large .",
    "since the bound state for heavier elements tends to be more stable against the destruction by the background photon , the abundances are modified only for heavier elements such as li and be , thanks to the capture at an earlier time before the nuclear reactions decouple . on the other hand ,",
    "the abundances of lighter elements such as d , t , @xmath2he , and @xmath5he are unchanged .",
    "in fact , even though more work needs to be done to find quantitative results , we have shown that the capture of champs may possibly have some impact on the bbn prediction of the primordial @xmath0li abundance . our approach to consider the cosmological effects of the formation of the champ bound states should also be attractive in some particle physics models  @xcite .    to understand cbbn more correctly ,",
    "we need to understand the nuclear fusion rates and the capture rates more precisely . however , unfortunately there are still some uncertainties in the experimental data of the reaction rates at present .",
    "we expect that the future nuclear experiments will clarify these points . if future collider experiments find a signal of long - lived charged particle inside the detector , the measurement of lifetime and decay properties of the charged particle will provide new insights to understand the phenomena in the early universe in turn .",

    "<S> we consider big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) with long - lived charged massive particles . before decaying , the long - lived charged particle recombines with a light element to form a bound state like a hydrogen atom . </S>",
    "<S> this effect modifies the nuclear reaction rates during the bbn epoch through the modifications of the coulomb field and the kinematics of the captured light elements , which can change the light element abundances . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible for heavier nuclei abundances such as @xmath0li and @xmath0be to decrease sizably , while the ratios @xmath1 , d / h , and @xmath2he / h remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this may solve the current discrepancy between the bbn prediction and the observed abundance of @xmath0li . if future collider experiments find signals of a long - lived charged particle inside the detector , the information of its lifetime and decay properties could provide insights into not only the particle physics models but also the phenomena in the early universe in turn . </S>"
