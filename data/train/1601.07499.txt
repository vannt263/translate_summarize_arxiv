    "since the first experimental proof of the existence of solids lacking of translational invariance , but exhibiting a discrete bragg diffraction spectrum @xcite , the study of _ quasicrystals _ attracted quite a lot of attention .",
    "the impact of this discovery on the scientific community was such that in 1992 the former definition of crystal had to be modified in order to include those structures whose diffraction pattern witnesses long range order yet lacking translational invariance @xcite .",
    "more generally , the study of quasiperiodic geometries has been recently the subject of different fields all devoted to the propagation of waves through quasiperiodic potentials .",
    "the spectral properties of quasicrystals have been recently used to engineer topological pumping in optical waveguides @xcite and in ultracold gases @xcite .",

    "dynamical and transport phenomena in this kind of structures are also radically different compared to periodic media @xcite . for usual periodic arrangements , dynamical and thermodynamical properties are directly related , via the bloch theorem , to the geometry of the system .",
    "quasiperiodic geometries , instead , lacks of translational invariance so that a direct relation between their structure and their dynamical properties is not generally known",

    "the fl is a 1d lattice whose adjacent points have distances belonging to the set @xmath0 , standing for long and short respectively , which are arranged according to a given sequence .",
    "such a lattice can be constructed by means of the cut and project technique @xcite thus obtaining for the coordinates of points on the real line @xcite ( in units of @xmath1 ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a natural positive number,@xmath4 is the integer part of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "the following relations hold true @xmath64 and @xmath65 . by inserting these relations into the expression for @xmath272",
    "we get :    @xmath273    where in the last line we used the fact that @xmath274 .",
    "this means that the lattice obtained by applying the composition rule @xmath67 has brightest peaks at the same positions of the original lattice only rescaled by a factor @xmath275 .      from eq.[eq :",
    "istrip2sum ] we can also estimate the relation between the intensities of the brightest peaks in the diffraction spectrum of two fl belonging to the same class . using the expression in eq.[eq : istrip2sum ] and assuming @xmath276 we can write @xmath277 . using the condition for @xmath278 and following a calculation similar to that to determined relation between the positions of the brightest peaks we find that @xmath279 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath280 meaning that the intensities of brightest peaks of the scaled lattice are more intense of those of the original lattice by a term proportional to the difference between the maximum attainable intensity and the intensity of the original lattice intensities .    in fig.[fig :",
    "diffint ] we plot the quantities ( blue dots ) @xmath281 and ( red cross ) @xmath282 for @xmath69 such that @xmath283 and for lattices of @xmath98 sites and @xmath284 and @xmath285 respectively .     and ( red cross )",

    "to test experimentally the diffraction from fl s , a series of quasi - periodic diffraction gratings have been prepared using a photorefractive direct laser writing ( dlw ) technique @xcite .",
    "this technique consists in scanning with a focused laser beam a photorefractive sample , engraving on it a series of lines with a modified refractive index with respect to the rest of the sample .",
    "the scanning movement is performed by translating the sample with the aid of a computer - controlled xy stage at constant speed of 50 @xmath289 .",
    "the nominal precision of the translation stage is 0.5@xmath290 for the conditions used in this experiment .",
    "a frequency doubled diode pumped @xmath291 solid state laser ( coherent verdi v5 ) emitting a cw beam at 532 nm has been used as light source for dlw .",
    "the beam was suitably attenuated by a series of neutral density filters and sent to a focusing microscope objective ( olympus 100x/0.80 ) so that the power after the objective was set at 17 mw .",
    "the substrate used to engrave the optical structures is a slab of photorefractive lithium niobate doped with iron at the nominal concentration of 0.1 mol% in the melt .",
    "the sample was x - cut with dimensions ( @xmath292 ) @xmath293 and the lines were written on the x face , by scanning along the y direction with an ordinarily polarized beam .",
    "this process can induce extraordinary refractive index changes as large as @xmath294 in the written lines and therefore can be used to produce arbitrary diffraction structures .",
    "the diffraction pattern of these structures was measured with the help of a computer - controlled optical diffractometer in which the sample and the detector were mounted on two co - axial goniometers that were independently controlled by a computer @xcite .",
    "an optical beam produced by a he - ne laser at 632.8 nm with a power of 4 mw was expanded , polarized along the extraordinary direction and finally transmitted through the sample surface , resulting in a clearly visible diffraction pattern .",
    "this pattern was measured by a si photodiode and a lock - in amplifier and recorded on the computer as a function of the detector and of the sample angle .",
    "in order to compare the experimental data with the theoretical calculation we need to take into account that our gratings are made up of a ( quasi ) periodic repetition of a region with a modified refractive index , @xmath295 .",
    "this leads to the fact , well known from standard diffraction theory , that the diffracted intensity in reciprocal space is proportional to the product of two terms : a first one , @xmath130=@xmath296 which depends on the detailed structure of the repeated unit of the grating ( _ structure factor _ ) and a second term due to lattice geometry , which is the true object of this study :      the structure factor modulates the intensity of the lattice diffraction pattern , complicating the comparison between experiments and theory . in principle",
    "@xmath130 could be calculated by knowing the details of the refractive index profile changes produced by our technique .",
    "here we used another approach which exploits the fact our samples differ only for the line position sequence @xmath123 .",
    "we can use therefore the periodic grating ( fig .",
    "[ fig : per23 ] ) to measure the function @xmath130 directly at the reciprocal lattice points @xmath298 of the periodic grating , where @xmath299 has local maxima .",
    "where the parameters @xmath301 are determined by a least square fit in the range @xmath302\\;\\mu m^{-1}$ ] excluding the last peaks because the corresponding momenta where comparable with a length scale of the order of the optical waveguide width . we also notice that all measured diffraction patterns drop almost to zero outside the interval @xmath303\\;\\mu m^{-1}$ ] ; this is due to the fact that our lines have a width determined by the laser writing optics which is not smaller than 2 @xmath290 , so that our diffraction pattern can not probe @xmath304 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : fib23_15 ] we compare the theoretical diffraction pattern @xmath45 with the experimental data points for the grating @xmath305 .",
    "the intensity of the experimental points has been rescaled to take into account the contribution of the structure factor of the grating and the @xmath69 axis of the experimental plot has been rescaled in order to compare it with the simulation , which considers fl s with @xmath9 .",
    "a similar figure is obtained for the case @xmath306 .",
    "the agreement is very satisfactory : not only the position but also the intensity of the diffraction peaks are correctly obtained , confirming that our approach is reliable .",
