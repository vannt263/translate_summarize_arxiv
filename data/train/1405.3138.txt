    "several continuing surveys are underway to find and catalog galaxies in the local volume , lv , defined as the region d @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite describes the latest version of the @xcite catalog of galaxies of the lv which now contains more than 800 galaxies .",
    "the catalog is complete to nearly 100% for galaxies within 2  and is about 70%-80%complete within 8 .",
    "the inventory of dwarfs within 10  is much more uncertain and there have been several recent efforts to improve the galaxy census in this region ; see especially @xcite .",
    "most recently , @xcite presents observational data for all of the approximately 100 dwarf galaxies in the local group for which d @xmath1 .",
    "more than 80% of the lv galaxies are dwarfs and nearly all of the undetected galaxies must be dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies which are the most challenging to detect .",
    "dsph galaxies are small @xmath2 and faint @xmath3 and are morphologically distinct from larger galaxies .",
    "dsph s are very gas - poor and do not possess structures such as a spiral arms or bulges and do not have a discernable nucleus .",
    "dsph galaxies are very dim with surface brightness in the range @xmath4 .",
    "dirr galaxies are somewhat larger and brighter than dsph galaxies and are distinguished from dsph galaxies by having a much greater gas content and by their characteristic appearance caused by lumpy star forming regions .",
    "dsph galaxies are usually found within about 100  of a larger galaxy whereas dirr are usually undisturbed and more distant from the nearest large galaxy .",
    "this is evidence that the two categories may overlap and that some dsph galaxies may be dirr galaxies which have been stripped of gas by interaction with the halo gas of a larger galaxy .      in this paper",
    "we are concerned with dsph galaxies near ngc  891 .",
    "ngc  891 is a nearby nearly perfectly edge - on ( @xmath5 ) spiral galaxy which is classified as sb / sbb and is a member of the ngc 1023 group .",
    "ngc  891 resembles the mw galaxy and has been been observed in many wavelengths .",
    "we take the the distance to ngc  891 to be 9.8  which is consistent with recent sbf and trgb measurements as given in @xcite so that @xmath6 .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of ngc 891 is v@xmath7 , suggesting a peculiar motion of about @xmath8 .",
    "ngc  891 is near to the galactic plane at latitude @xmath9 and is very near to the supergalactic plane at @xmath10 .",
    "the foreground extinction toward ngc  891 is .28 mag in b which is significant but , even so , detailed observations in the region are possible .",
    "@xcite presents evidence of an ancient accretion event which affected ngc  891 .",
    "they find features which extend well into the halo including a number of arcing loops extending to about 30  to the east of the disk and 40  to the west .",
    "the loops appear to connect and show high metallicity and ages greater than a few gigayears .",
    "tidal streams of this sort are quite common in the lv .",
    "@xcite , for instance , observed eight spiral galaxies using very deep @xmath11 wide field imaging and found that six of the galaxies had previously undetected stellar structures extending out to @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite also found evidence of an accretion event : a large filament which extends out to about 22  above the plane of the galaxy contains about 1.2 @xmath13 @xmath14  of .",
    "@xcite performs a simple calculation which shows that it is unlikely that this large amount of gas could have been expelled by a galactic fountain type of mechanism and must therefore be due to an accretion event . finally , @xcite found asymmetries in the distribution of planetary nebula of ngc  891 which they take as evidence of a collision or fly - by interaction .",
    "if the disturbances to ngc  891 were caused by a collision with another galaxy there should be nearby evidence of the disrupting galaxy .",
    "@xcite proposed that the gas rich dwarf irregular galaxy ugc 1807 , which is 29@xmath15  distant from ngc  891 , might have caused the disturbance .",
    "however , ugc 1807 appears to be undisturbed and shows no signs of a recent interaction and so there is reason to suppose that even if ugc 1807 was the original disrupting galaxy there might be one or more dwarf galaxies in the near vicinity on ngc  891 consisting of tidal remnants of the original collision which account for the continuing disturbances .",
    "the panoramic view of the halo region of ngc 891 presented in @xcite was the impetus for the search presented here and their figure 1 .",
    "@xcite used the subaru prime focus camera on the 8.2 meter subaru telescope to image the brightest 2 mags of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in the outer regions of ngc  891 .",
    "the images were processed to eliminate foreground stars and other artifacts and to isolate rgb halo stars .",
    "the resulting panoramic view of ngc  891 covers a 90  x 90  area and consists of points representing rgb stars in the halo .",
    "unremarked in @xcite , the panoramic view shows an overdensity of rgb stars in the nw quadrant of the halo of ngc  891 which frame the tidal radius of dwarf galaxy hfllzoa f172 @xcite at a distance of 15@xmath15   from ngc 891 .",
    "figure [ fig : cutfrommouhcine ] is a blowup of a small section of [ fig : frommouhcine ] , which is reproduced from @xcite",
    ". inspection of archived images found that hfllzoa f172 is certainly a dsph and its association with the halo stars proves that it is in the halo of ngc 891 .",
    "archived images of the other galaxies in the @xcite catalog within 1@xmath16of ngc  891 were examined and a single additional dsph was found : hfllzoa f182 at a distance of 20.1@xmath15 .",
    "the remaining galaxies in the @xcite catalog near to ngc  891 were either background galaxies or were ambiguous .",
    "the cold dark matter(cdm ) model predicts that galaxy formation arises by a hierarchical combination of small cdm halos which begins at high redshifts(@xmath17 ) and is essentially complete by about @xmath18@xcite .",
    "this clustering is purely gravitational and is driven by the dominant cdm component .",
    "baryonic material which falls into the the cdm gravitational wells builds the visible structures of the galaxies as gas cools and forms stars in a process which continues to the present day .",
    "simulations predict that the outermost regions of acquired cdm satellites merge with the halo of the accreting galaxy to form a single large cdm halo such as that which is thought to host the mw galaxy .",
    "the cores of most of the cdm satellites are predicted to survive and we observe the baryonic portions of these satellites as dwarf galaxies .",
    "the so - called missing satellite problem @xcite is that far fewer dwarf companions of large galaxies are observed than are predicted . for example , a galaxy the size of the mw way is predicted to have several hundred dwarf companions whereas only 26 have been discovered to date and this discrepancy seems to apply generally .",
    "it s possible that the predicted dm subhalos do not , in fact , exist but this would conflict with the concordant model and so much effort is being spent to reconcile the disagreement .",
    "@xcite summarize the recent work related to the recent discovery of more than 2 dozen new dwarf companions to the milky way and m31 .",
    "most of the new dwarfs are fainter than any previously known galaxies with the faintest dwarfs having luminosity of only @xmath19 which supports the idea that there is a large population of dwarf galaxies that have not yet been detected . assuming that the new class of dwarfs can satisfy the numeric deficiency the most pressing problem is to determine the relationship between dwarf luminosity , dwarf baryonic mass , and the mass of the dm subhalo .",
    "currently there is no useful trend and in some cases the kinetics of the smallest , least luminous , dwarfs imply a dm halo which is as massive as systems 10,000 times more luminous .    a number of studies ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown the processes of supernova heating and the reionization of the universe could have had a strong effect to reduce the baryonic fraction of dwarfs at z @xmath20 6 . later",
    ", stochastic effects might have resulted in the situation which seem we seem to see today where some very large halos have not acquired significant baryonic component@xcite .",
    "alternately , @xcite proposes that ram - pressure stripping and super - nova heating combined can account for the observed populations of gas - poor dwarfs within about 270  of their primary .",
    "@xcite supports the idea that the abundance of dm halos as a function of their mass is well known and supported by basic theory .",
    "they propose that stellar mass as a function of the halo mass is monotonic but not at all linear .",
    "star formation efficiency is much lower for both the highest and the lowest halo mass systems and so we observe a distribution of galaxies which is biased toward middle values .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss a further complication in that the kinematics of the brightest dwarf satellites of the milky way imply a halo density distribution which is much less dense than demanded by theory .",
    "the apparent lack of high mass subhalos might be a more fundamental problem than the numeric deficiency .",
    "the current work contributes to understanding the  missing satellite problem \" by providing a dwarf galaxy count for a galaxy similar to the mw .",
    "it is part of a growing number of surveys which indicate more and more strongly that there is a basic conflict between theory and observation .",
    "a methodical search for visible galaxies in the vicinity of ngc 891 was undertaken by examining candidates taken from the guide star catalog ii ( gsc 2.3.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "the gsc 2.3.2 is a deep all - sky catalog derived from the digitized sky surveys , which in turn were created from palomar and uk schmidt survey plates , and is based on at least two epochs and three passbands .",
    "the catalog classifies objects as one of two types :  stars \" , which are classified correctly as such with high confidence , and",
    " nonstars \" which include not only galaxies but also overlapping images and artifacts such as diffraction spikes near bright stars , halos , etc . in general ,  nonstars \" are primarily galaxies far from the galactic plane and primarily blends near the plane .",
    "the stellar magnitudes given in gsc 2.3.2 are accurate . however , because the photometric pipeline is tuned for point - like objects , the magnitude of bright galaxies @xmath21 are systematically overestimated .",
    "the @xmath22  magnitudes are most affected and were found to be overestimated by as much as several magnitudes .",
    "the candidates were 173  nonstars \" from the gsc 2.3.2 catalog lying within 40@xmath15  of ngc  891 ( 113  at the distance of ngc  891 ) for which the major axis was greater than 15 .",
    "the search region was limited in order to keep the number of candidates to a reasonable total and because _ galex _",
    "observations covered this region .    each of the candidate ",
    "non - stars \" was examined by using the nasa _ skyview _ utility to generate @xmath23 false color images from archived data consisting of _ galex _  fuv and nuv images@xcite ; dss2 r , b and nir images ; 2mass h , j and k images @xcite ; and wise w1 , w2 , w3 and w4 images @xcite .",
    "in addition a standard rgb image constructed from _",
    "nuv , dss2 r and 2mass j wavelengths proved useful because of the large uv excess exhibited by the dsph galaxies in the sample .",
    "these observations in several wavelengths eliminated overlapping images and artifacts with high confidence leaving 71 confirmed galaxies which comprise a complete size - limited survey of the region .",
    "the goal of the present study is to differentiate foreground dsph galaxies from normally sized galaxies at a much greater distance in the background .",
    "this task is similar to that described in @xcite which defined photometric and structural properties of galaxies in clusters in order to discriminate members of the abell 426 group ( at at distance of 77 ) from background galaxies at distances up to z=0.5 .",
    "however , it is easier to distinguish dsph s because they are very different in morphology from the larger galaxies whereas the differences which separate cluster galaxies from isolated galaxies are relatively subtle .",
    "in addition , the availability of images at many wavelengths is invaluable .",
    "dsph galaxies have diameters in the range of about 200 pc @xmath24 1,800 pc . by design ,",
    "the minimum diameter of the survey galaxies is 15  and the diameter of largest galaxies for which there is no velocity data is about 40 . at the distance",
    "ngc 891 this range of angular size corresponds to a range of actual size of about 700 pc @xmath24 1,900 pc compared to a range of actual size of about 5,000 pc @xmath24 15,000 pc at the distance of the abell 347 cluster .",
    "thus , based on the size , the foreground galaxies consist solely of dsph galaxies whereas the background galaxies are normally - sized ; two distinctly different populations .    since many of the survey galaxies lack measured distances , it is not possible to use absolute magnitude to identify likely dsph galaxies .",
    "instead we ordered the candidates using a @xmath25  surface brightness metric calculated from the apparent nir magnitude and angular size as given in the gsc 2.3.2 catalog .",
    "testing showed that this parameter is the best discriminator to sort out foreground from background galaxies , presumably because nir magnitude is a better measure of stellar surface mass density than the r or b magnitudes , which show much more scatter .",
    "note that the magnitudes given in gsc 2.3.2 for extended sources are known to be systematically too bright by 2 mag or more and the cataloged radial size ( which is the projected radius at which the r magnitude surface brightness reaches the background level ) differs significantly from the tidal radius which would be more appropriate for this use . despite these known errors ,",
    "the metric is useful because it is a monotonic measure sufficient for the purpose of sorting and comparing the candidates .",
    "the survey galaxies were ordered by @xmath25  surface brightness metric described above and it was found that _",
    "none _ of the lowest surface brightness candidates @xmath26 showed signs of structure such as spiral arms or a discernable core .",
    "in contrast , _ all _ of the higher surface brightness candidate galaxies for which @xmath27 showed signs of structure such spiral arms and most commonly a distinct core and so are not dsph galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with previous work ; see for example @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that nondetections of hi occur in low - mass dwarfs that are within about 300  of their host .",
    "similarly , @xcite reports that galaxies within about 270  of the milky way or andromeda are undetected in  ( i.e.  mass is less than about @xmath28 for milky way dwarfs ) , while those further than  270  are predominantly detected with  masses in the range @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "the ngc  891 companion dsph galaxies are consistent with this finding in that none of the dsph galaxies near ngc 891 were found by the 2masx survey and the candidate galaxies which were dimmest in nir were not detected in 2mass j , h , or k bands or in wise w3 or w4 bands which are sensitive to secondary emissions from the dust and gas in the ism .",
    "the 2masx survey @xcite extended source sensitivity is about 14.7 , 13.9 , and 13.1 mag at @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the detection thresholds were chosen to assure complete detection of galaxies brighter than @xmath34 and @xmath35 mag away from the galactic plane and the limit is somewhat brighter close to the plane . because the lowest surface brightness galaxies are bluer within the nir bands ,",
    "the faintest galaxies are observed only in j. some previous surveys of the lv galaxies took candidates from the 2masx catalog ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and these surveys missed the gas - free dsph galaxies reported here even though they are readily apparent uv and visible wavelengths .    here",
    "we make the assumption that background galaxies are members of the abell 347 cluster in the background of ngc 891 .",
    "abell 347 is at a nominal recession velocity of v=5516 @xmath36  and is a member of the perseus - pisces supercluster .",
    "as argued in @xcite , the void between the lv and the abell 347 cluster makes it possible to distinguish between the foreground and background galaxies based on morphology with some degree of confidence .",
    "accordingly , a goal of the present study is to differentiate between dsph galaxies in the foreground at a distance of about 9.8  and background galaxies at a distance of about 72  or more . in particular , the velocity histogram presented as figure 4 of @xcite supports the assumption that contamination along the line of sight to the abell 347 cluster is insignificant .",
    "the @xcite catalog identifies a total 37 members of abell 347 , 12 of which are in the region @xmath37 around ngc 891 , and the recent 2mrs survey @xcite approximately doubles these counts .",
    "all but four of the background galaxies for which there are measured velocities lie between 5,500 @xmath36  and 6,500 @xmath36  and there no galaxies in the background of ngc 891 with measured velocities between 630@xmath36  and 4450@xmath36 .",
    "table [ tbl : allgal ] gives data for the 71 galaxies from the gsc 2.3.2 catalog .",
    "table [ tbl : allgal ] provides the following information :                                  table [ tbl : allgal ] identifies 7 dwarf companions of ngc 891 all but two of which are new discoveries .",
    "note that the boundary which defines the dwarf galaxies is uncertain by at least 0.5 mag which might have caused a few of the galaxies in table [ tbl : allgal ] to be mis - classified .",
    "figure [ fig : ngc891_with_dsphs ] shows the distribution of the dwarf galaxies relative to ngc 891 .",
    "the dwarfs appear to be distributed isotropically around ngc 891 , the host galaxy .",
    "the dsph galaxies which were determined to be companions of ngc 891 showed weak indication in wise w1 and w2 bands which are sensitive to emission from the stellar disk .",
    "in contrast , none of the dsph galaxies are visible in the wise w3 and w4 bands which primarily measure emission from dust the ism .",
    "we take this to mean that these galaxies have been stripped of essentially all gas and dust .",
    "figure [ fig : allgal ] provides a set of 13 false color images generated using the skyview utility for of each of the table [ tbl : allgal ] entries .",
    "the images are sorted by dss2 nir surface brightness in the same way as the table [ tbl : allgal ] entries .",
    "each of the images cover a @xmath41 field of view and is centered at the coordinates given in table [ tbl : allgal ] .",
    "the first image of each set is a rgb overlay and the remaining images use linear brightness scaling and a preset false color scheme ( the `` stern special '' ) which was found to best bring out the faintest images .",
