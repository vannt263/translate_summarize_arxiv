    "the behavior of many quantum systems strongly depends on their interaction with the environment .",
    "it is important to take this interaction into account to realistically describe systems like , e.g. , vibrational levels in a big molecule , the quantized mode of an electromagnetic field , or a trapped ion .",
    "the rapid development of experimental techniques in these and other branches of physics and chemistry leads to an increased interest in theoretical descriptions of possible experiments by numerical calculations . additionally our calculations , which concern such systems , allow us to regard the still existing question about the border between classical and quantum effects from a new point of view .",
    "for the systems , which are described here , the border to disappearance of quantum effects has been estimated .",
    "one of the fundamental questions of quantum physics is to understand why the general principle of superposition works very well in microscopic physics but leads to paradox situations in macroscopic physics such as the schrdinger cat paradox @xcite where the cat can exist in a superposition of the states dead and alive .",
    "one possible explanation of the paradox and the nonobserving of a macroscopic superposition is that @xcite systems are never completely isolated but interact with an environment , that contains a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "interactions with the environment lead to continuous loss of coherence and drive the system from a superposition into a statistical classical mixture .",
    "the interest in the decoherence problem is explained not only by its relation to the fundamental question :  where is the borderline between the macroscopic world of classical physics and microscopic phenomena ruled by quantum mechanics ?  , but also by the increasing significance of potential practical applications of quantum mechanics , such as quantum computation and cryptography [ 3 , 4 ] .",
    "there are a number of propositions how to create the superposition states in mesoscopic systems , or systems that have both macroscopic and microscopic features .",
    "representative examples are the superposition of two coherent states of an harmonic oscillator @xmath0 for a relatively large amplitude ( @xmath1 ) . here",

    "these states have been observed recently for the intracavity microwave field @xcite and for motional states of a trapped ion @xcite .",

    ", quantum decoherence has been studied extensively [ 2 , 9 - 16 ] .",
    "most efforts focused on the decoherence of the harmonic oscillator states due to the coupling to a heat bath , consisting of a large number of oscillators representing the environment .",
    "the system is usually described on the basis of the master equation for a reduced density operator .",
    "there are two general approaches for this method .",
    "one adopts the markov approximation together with the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "that means that all details of the complex system - environment interactions are neglected and relaxation is described by characteristic decay constants .",
    "the system - bath interaction is phase - insensitive because of the rwa . in another approach , according to zurek @xcite , the coupling with the environment singles out a preferred set of states , called  the pointer basis  .",
    "only vectors of this basis survive the quantum dynamics .",
    "the vectors of the pointer basis are the eigenvectors of operators , which commute with the ( full ) interaction hamiltonian of the system .",
    "this basis depends on the form of the coupling .",
    "very often this pointer basis consists of the eigenstates of the coordinate operator .",
    "the density operator describing the system evolves to diagonal form in the pointer basis , which is usually connected to the disappearance of quantum interference .",
    "the two approaches give different pictures of the same decoherence processes .",

    "we show the time dependence of the mean value of the coordinate in fig .",
    "the mean value in the usual system decreases with a constant rate .",
    "the same initial value of the system coupled to a bath with @xmath137 shows a fast decrement in the first stage and almost no decrement afterwards .",
    "the question about the influence of the type of the bath on the evolution of the superpositional state is of special importance . at a temperature of @xmath146 , corresponding to @xmath147 , we have simulated the evolution of the same superpositional states twice , for @xmath131 and @xmath130 .",
    "the coordinate representation of the wave packets is presented in fig . 4b and 4c . the same value of the relaxation @xmath148 yields , however , different results . in the system",
    "coupled to the usual bath the quantum interference disappears already during the first period , while the amplitude decreases only slightly . in the other case ,",
    "the system coupled to the bath with @xmath130 leaves the interference almost unchanged , although a fast reduction of the amplitude occurs .",
    "therefore , the second system partially conserves the quantum superpositional state .",
    "the experimental investigation of systems displaying such properties [ 2 ] is necessary , both for extracting typical parameter ranges for theoretical models and for practical applications like quantum computation and quantum cryptography .",
    "the described example leads us to the conclusion that the second type of environment is more preferable .",
    "starting from von neumann s equation for a vibrational oscillator interacting with the environment modeled by a set of independent harmonic oscillators we derived a non - markovian master equation , which has been solved analytically . for two types of the bath with maximum of the spectral density near the system frequency and near twice the system frequency and for two different initial states , namely a coherent state and a superposition of coherent states , the wave packet dynamics in coordinate representation have been analyzed .",
    "it has been shown that wave packet dynamics demonstrate either  classical squeezing  and a decrease of the effective vibrational oscillator frequency due to the phase - dependent interaction with the bath or a time - dependent relaxation rate , distinct for even and odd states , and partial conservation of quantum superposition due to the quadratic interaction with the bath .",
    "the decoherence also shows differences compared to the usual damping processes adopting rwa and to the description using the pointer basis for decoherence processes .",
    "we conclude that there is no permanent pointer basis for the decay .",
    "there are two universal stages of relaxation : the coherence time scale stage and the markovian stage of relaxation , both having different pointer bases .",
    "we believe that the proposed method can be applied for other initial states and different couplings with the environment in real existing quantum systems , which is important in the light of recent achievements in single molecule spectroscopy , trapped ion states engineering , and quantum computation .    99 e. schrdinger , naturwissenschaften * 23 * , 807 ( 1935 ) ; * 23 * , 823 ( 1935 ) ; * 23 * , 844 ( 1935 ) .",
