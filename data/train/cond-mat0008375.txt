    "we also allow for the possibility of electron scattering by impurities in the semiconductor by introducing a potential @xmath24 . the magnetic field is assumed to lie in the @xmath21-@xmath20 plane : thus @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    ". a fuller discussion of the gauge invariance of the born - oppenheimer method is given in chapter 3.7 of ref .  .",

    "@xmath23 is the typical extent of the subband wavefunction in the @xmath20-direction and @xmath72 is the fermi wavelength of the electrons .",
    "the first condition is to ensure that the electron density is not so high that more than one subband is occupied .",
    "the other two inequalities are adiabaticity requirements on the surface roughness needed to ensure that the motion in the plane of the interface can be approximately decoupled from the transverse motion .",
    "they stipulate that the roughness must vary slowly on a scale determined by the strength of the confining potential .    to check the validity of the adiabaticity conditions we can use the atomic force microscope images of the silicon - oxide interface presented in ref .",
    "these images reveal that the height fluctuations of the interface follow a gaussian distribution parameterized by @xmath73 , the root mean square height fluctuation , and @xmath74 , the correlation distance .",
    "the discussion of appendix a suggests that the surface @xmath64 should be similarly distributed with essentially the same parameters .",
    "hence the adiabaticity conditions can be expressed in terms of the observable parameters as @xmath75 and @xmath76 and are seen to be very well satisfied for both samples of ref .  .",
    "the purpose of this section is to review the calculation of the weak localization lineshape .",
    "the calculation is reformulated in a way that is suitable for the eventual goal of calculating the tilted field magnetoresistance of a mosfet with a rough interface .    in the previous section",
    "it was shown that effectively the electrons move in two dimensions under the influence of a random potential , @xmath77 , and a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is the sum of the applied perpendicular field and the geometric field , which is due to interface roughness and the applied parallel field .",
    "it is assumed that the surface @xmath56 is a gaussian random surface with zero mean and variance given by @xmath78 as noted above , atomic force microscope images of the silicon - oxide interface presented in ref .",
    "reveal a gaussian random surface , which makes it extremely plausible that the surface @xmath79 must also be gaussian .",

    "here we shall assume that the random potential is gaussian white noise with zero mean and variance @xmath82 .",
    "since we assume that the interface roughness is correlated over a length scale @xmath74 , strictly the assumption that the random potential is gaussian white noise is justified only under special circumstances ( if the impurity potential is white noise and it dominates interface roughness scattering , or if @xmath74 is much smaller than all relevant length scales and the impurity scattering is either also white noise or is dominated by interface roughness scattering ) , but in practice it is reasonable to believe that our results will be more broadly applicable since localization effects are believed to be insensitive to microscopic details of the random potential .",
    "we estimate that for both samples studied in ref .",
    "impurity scattering dominates interface roughness scattering , and for one sample @xmath74 is shorter than all relevant length scales in addition ; but it is expected that the results should apply under less favorable circumstances also .",

    "the average of a product of green functions does not factorize into a product of the averages ; it is correlated by the underlying random potential .",
    "the correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath86 responsible for weak localization is called the cooperon , @xmath99 .",

    "an inhomogeneous magnetic field leads to many interesting features in the magnetoresistance even in the classical and ballistic regimes ; many experiments have focused on these effects .",
    "except for the work of rammer and shelankov @xcite noted below , much of the theoretical literature too explores these regimes or focuses on the fundamental question of whether all eigenstates are localized in a random magnetic field .",
    "two experiments study quantum corrections in the weak - localization limit : in the work of bending , von klitzing and ploog @xcite the inhomogeneous magnetic field is produced by an abrikosov lattice of flux lines in the superconducting gate ; hence it is periodic .",
    "however the magnetoresistance is not sensitive to the arrangement of the vortices since the dephasing length is shorter than the distances between the vortices .",
    "this circumstance was analyzed by rammer and shelankov @xcite . in the experiment of gusev _",
    "too the magnetic field is essentially periodic rather than random allowing them to analyze it via a chessboard model @xcite .",
    "thus in both these works the inhomogeneous magnetic field is rather different from the random gaussian correlated field studied in the experiments of wheeler and co - workers and analyzed here .",
    "in this paper we have been concerned with the influence of interface roughness on the magnetoconductance of mosfets . using a born - oppenheimer approximation we have shown",
    "that effectively electrons respond to an applied in - plane magnetic field as though it were a random perpendicular field . technically , the random magnetic field appears as a berry phase term in the born - oppenheimer effective hamiltonian .",
    "( 9 ) shows that the random magnetic field is the component of @xmath0 normal to the rough surface @xmath56 .",
    "the born - oppenheimer analysis also gives precise meaning to the surface @xmath56 : it is the location of the centre of the local subband wavefunction .",
    "the next step is to analyze the magnetoconductance .",
    "this is controlled by the familiar physics of weak - localization : at zero field there is a contribution to the conductance due to constructive interference of closed electron paths and their time - reversed counterparts .",
    "this contribution is suppressed by application of a perpendicular magnetic field because the electron acquires an aharonov - bohm phase as it traverses a closed path .",
    "the analysis of this paper shows that an in - plane field too has an effect due to interface roughness .",
    "the electron acquires a berry s phase equal to the flux of the random field through the closed path .",
    "the effect of the random berry s phase on the conductance is the main focus of this paper .    to calculate the effect it is necessary to sum the standard divergent series of cooperon diagrams ( fig .",
    "we find it useful to reformulate this sum in a manner reminiscent of the central limit theorem .",
    "feynman graphs of high order control the sum . in these graphs",
    "we are able , without significant error , to replace pairs of green function lines with suitable gaussian factors . at zero field ,",
    "the @xmath35 order diagram is then essentially the weight of a closed @xmath133-step gaussian random walk [ eq .",

    ", this formulation brings out clearly the relationship between the classic weak - localization lineshape ( eq .",
    "44 ) and the distribution of directed area for closed random walks ( see eqs .",
    "38 and 39 and appendix c ) .",
    "the method also proves useful when an in - plane field is applied for long - range correlated roughness ( @xmath254 ) . in this case",
    "the magnetoconductance is related to the directed area distribution of an _ interacting _ random walk ( see eqs .",
    "63 and 73 ) . to make contact with experiment",
    "it is sufficient to analyze this problem perturbatively .",
    "we do not attempt a complete solution of the interacting random walk or calculation of the full magnetoconductance for long - range correlated roughness .",
    "these problems are left open for future work .    for short - range correlated roughness , however , we are able to obtain the full magnetoconductance . the dependence of the conductance on perpendicular field , @xmath1 , still has the classic weak - localization lineshape ( eq .",
    "44 ) when an in - plane field is applied , just as it does at @xmath63 .",
    "the only effect of the in - plane field is to enhance the dephasing rate ( eq .",
    "52 ) . in terms of field scales",
    ", @xmath357 becomes larger ; the effective @xmath357 is given by eq .",
    "hence we say that short - range correlated roughness produces homogeneous broadening of the weak - localization lineshape .",
    "the departure from the conventional lineshape is more striking in case of long - range correlated roughness ( although quantitatively smaller if all parameters except @xmath74 are held fixed ) .",
    "the change in conductance , @xmath329 , when a parallel field is applied ( `` parallel field magnetoconductance '' ) is given by eq .",
    "the most remarkable feature of this expression is that it is independent of @xmath211 .",
    "@xmath329 is determined entirely by the magnetic field , geometric parameters of the interface , @xmath15 and @xmath74 , and the dephasing length , @xmath285 .",
    "it may be of either sign ( positive near @xmath255 and negative for large @xmath1 ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath329 is lengthy and can not be more compactly expressed in terms of known special functions .",
    "it can be numerically computed and plotted with ease and precision ; however it is worthwhile to examine several special cases .    in the limit of",
    "extremely long - ranged roughness , @xmath358 , the parallel field magnetoconductance has a simple interpretation : the sample breaks up into independent blocks of size @xmath290 each of which sees a slightly different magnetic field .",
    "hence in this limit we say that the effect of an in - plane field and roughness is to inhomogeneously broaden the weak - localization line . pursuing this interpretation",
    "we can understand the sign change in @xmath329 and recover its form in various circumstances [ see the discussion following eqs .",
    "( 70 ) and ( 82 ) ] .",
    "the limit of intermediate - range correlated roughness , @xmath359 , is particularly striking . for sufficiently large perpendicular field , @xmath360 ,",
    "@xmath329 becomes independent not only of @xmath211 but also @xmath3 [ see eq . ( 79 ) ] .",
    "essentially the parallel magnetoconductance is controlled by the function @xmath325 where @xmath361 is a measure of the perpendicular flux ( see fig .",
    "another special case , useful for making contact with experiment @xcite is the parallel field magnetoconductance for @xmath362 ( eq .",

    "@xmath284 describes the crossover as @xmath3 is varied relative to @xmath74 ( @xmath365 .",
    "wheeler and co - workers have shown experimentally in a number of cases that the effect of an in - plane field is to produce homogeneous broadening .",
    "our analysis of the short - range correlated regime provides a theoretical justification of such fits to data and allows quantitative information about the interface roughness to be extracted .",
    "it is encouraging that for the control sample studied by anderson _",
    "@xcite , for which the interface parameters are independently measured via atomic force microscopy , our formulae give a satisfactory zero parameter fit ( fig",
    "unfortunately , our analysis shows that in the short - range regime , magnetoresistance measurements will not separately yield @xmath15 and @xmath74 : instead they provide the combination @xmath356 .",
    "thus it will be necessary to combine magnetoconductance measurements with other techniques to separately obtain @xmath15 and @xmath74 .",
    "the roughness of the interface is controlled by its processing .",
    "for example , anderson _",
    "_ @xcite are able to increase both @xmath15 and @xmath74 by argon sputtering the silicon surface prior to gate oxidation",
    ". it would be desirable to create devices with long - range correlated roughness in order to experimentally observe , for example , the geometric regime described above . at the same time , for long - range correlated roughness , the prospects are much better for extracting both @xmath15 and @xmath74 from magnetoconductance measurements alone , provided the measurements can be made with sufficient precision .",
    "( 76 ) provides the means to study the feasibility of such experiments .",
    "another potential application of our analysis is related to efforts to engineer the mosfet interface to have specific structure , for example , a structure that is periodic in one direction like a corrugated sheet @xcite .",
    "weak - localization magnetoconductance measurements would provide a non - destructive way to check that structures have been successfully fabricated .",
