    "one of the problems one faces when one tries to construct a fundamental theory of quantum gravity is the absence of any experimental data or observations that necessarily would have to be explained by the theory @xcite . in this situation",
    "it is particularly important to compare the predictions of a priori different candidate theories and to find out whether they are perhaps just different formulations of the same underlying theory or whether they really belong to different `` universality classes '' . in this way one can at least narrow down the set of independent possibilities among which the experiment must decide in the end . guided by the experience with yang - mills theory",
    "we would expect that in particular the comparison of continuum and lattice approaches should be very instructive and fruitful .",
    "on the side of the continuum approaches , recently a lot of efforts went into the exploration of the asymptotic safety scenario @xcite in the formulation based upon the gravitational average action .",
    "it aims at defining a microscopic quantum field theory of gravity in terms of a complete , i.e. , infinitely extended renormalization group ( rg ) trajectory on the theory space of diffeomorphism invariant functionals of the metric .",
    "the limit of an infinite ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff is taken by arranging this trajectory to approach a non - gaussian fixed point ( ngfp ) at large scales ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this ngfp of the effective average action is not only instrumental in constructing the quantum field theory by dictating how all generalized couplings must `` run '' when the uv regulator scale is sent to infinity , it also determines the physical properties of the resulting regulator - free theory at large _ physical _ scales , the behavior of propagators at large momenta , for instance .",
    "we refer to this quantum field theory of the metric , defined in the continuum by means of the effective average action , as quantum einstein gravity ( qeg ) .    in yang - mills theory , the asymptotic scaling behavior that controls the approach to the continuum of the corresponding lattice gauge theory",
    "can be read off from the corresponding effective average action @xcite .",
    "it is therefore plausible to ask whether there is an analogous relationship between qeg and gravity on a ( dynamical ) lattice . a first comparison ( of critical indices )",
    "has been attempted in @xcite where the results from the average action were confronted with monte carlo data obtained in regge calculus simulations @xcite .",
    "the results were found to be consistent , albeit within considerable error bars .",
    "a different statistical - mechanics based framework for quantum gravity that has been developed during the past years is the causal dynamical triangulation ( cdt ) approach @xcite .",
    "it provides a background - independent , nonperturbative definition of quantum gravity in which the causal ( i.e. , lorentzian ) structure of spacetime plays a crucial role . only causally",
    "well - behaved geometries contribute to the path integral .",
    "it is regularized by summing over a particular class of triangulated , piecewise flat geometries .",
    "all contributing spacetimes are foliated by a kind of proper - time and can be obtained by gluing together 4-simplices in a way that respects this foliation .",
    "the slices of constant proper - time consist of spacelike tetrahedra forming a 3-dimensional piecewise flat manifold . typically its topology is assumed to be that of a three - sphere @xmath1 .",
    "each configuration contributing to the regularized path integral can be rotated to euclidean signature , and the rotated partition function can be computed by means of standard monte carlo methods .",
    "it was found @xcite that the cdt approach can generate almost classical 4-dimensional universes on which only small quantum fluctuations are superimposed .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an effective action for the robertson - walker scale factor @xmath2 of these universes has been extracted from the monte carlo data . in the present paper we are going to compare this effective action to the corresponding prediction of qeg .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the latter reflects the non - gaussian fixed point , the crucial prerequisite of asymptotic safety , by a characteristic `` finger print '' at small scale factors .",
    "the very same finger print has actually been observed already in the cdt simulations .",
    "we interprete these results as an indication pointing in the direction that qeg and the cdt approach could possibly describe the same underlying theory in different languages , i.e. that they are two representatives of the same `` universality class '' .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite another point of contact between cdt and qeg had been found already : they agree on the microscopic spectral dimension of macroscopically 4-dimensional spacetimes ; in either case one finds the somewhat surprising result @xmath3 .",
    "the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we analyze the effective potential of the conformal factor in qeg and discuss in particular the impact the ngfp has on it . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we make contact with the cdt simulations , and in section [ s4 ] we present the conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss the standard effective potential ( i.e. , the one with vanishing infrared cutoff , @xmath4 ) for the conformal factor of metrics on maximally symmetric spacetimes with the topology of a @xmath5-dimensional sphere @xmath6 .",
    "the starting point is the _ exact _ gravitational effective average action @xcite along some rg trajectory , @xmath7 $ ] , and the related reduced functional @xmath8 \\equiv \\gamma_k [ g_{\\mu\\nu } , g_{\\mu\\nu}]$ ] .",
    "( the ghost arguments are set to zero and are not indicated explicitly . )",

    "we specialize for metrics on @xmath6 , with a variable radius @xmath18 .",

    "( this relation can be regarded the definition of the canonical mass dimension . )",
    "eq .   makes it manifest that if we know a complete rg trajectory @xmath32 we can deduce the exact running potential from it , and in particular its @xmath33 limit , the standard effective potential @xmath34 .",
    "usually we are not in the comfortable situation of knowing trajectories exactly ; nevertheless certain important properties of @xmath35 can be deduced on general grounds . for this purpose",
    "we shall employ the following decoupling argument which is standard in the average action context @xcite .",
    "the basic observation is that the true , i.e. dimensionful coupling constants @xmath36 have a significant running with @xmath37 only as long as the number of field modes integrated out actually depends on @xmath37 .",
    "if there are competing physical cutoff scales such as masses or field amplitudes the running with @xmath37 stops once @xmath37 becomes smaller than the physical cutoff scales .",
    "( see appendix c.3 of @xcite for an example . ) in the case at hand this situation is realized in a particularly transparent way .",
    "the quantum metric is expanded in terms of eigenfunctions of the covariant ( tensor ) laplacian @xmath38 of the metric @xmath39 .",
    "this metric corresponds to a sphere of radius @xmath18 ; hence all eigenvalues of the laplacian are discrete multiples of @xmath40 . as a result ,",
    "when @xmath37 has become as small as @xmath41 , the bulk of eigenvalues is integrated out , and the @xmath12 s no longer change much when @xmath37 is lowered even further .",
    "therefore we can approximate @xmath42    in order to make the approximation strictly valid we have to be slightly more specific about the precise definition of @xmath25 .",
    "the above argument could be spoiled by zero modes of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore we define @xmath43 and @xmath44 in terms of a functional integral over the fluctuation modes of the metric with a non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath38 only . as a result ,",
    "the actual partition function would obtain by a final integration over the zero modes which is not performed here .",
    "the only zero mode relevant in the case at hand is the fluctuation of the conformal factor .",
    "when we compare our results to the cdt simulations later on it will be important to keep in mind that @xmath35 has the interpretation of an effective potential in which the conformal fluctuation has not yet been integrated out since it is essentially this quantity that is provided by the monte carlo simulations .",
    ".   has a simple intuitive interpretation in terms of coarse graining : by lowering @xmath37 below @xmath45 one tries to `` average '' field configurations over a volume that would be larger than the volume of the whole universe .",
    "as this is not possible , the running stops .",
    "note that the @xmath6 topology enters here ; the finite volume of the sphere is crucial .    with the approximation",
    "we obtain the following two equivalent representations of @xmath35 in terms of the dimensionless and dimensionful running couplings , respectively : @xmath46 \\\\",

    "let us assume the rg trajectory under consideration has a _ classical regime _ between the scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 , meaning that @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "then implies that for @xmath51 , approximately , @xmath52 \\:\\phi^{d_\\alpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as expected , this potential has a nontrivial @xmath18-dependence governed by the classical couplings @xmath53 .",
    "next let us explore the consequences which a non - gaussian fixed point has for the effective potential .",
    "we assume that the dimensionless couplings @xmath54 approach fixed point values @xmath55 for @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , we make the approximation @xmath56 for @xmath57 with @xmath58 the lower boundary of the asymptotic scaling regime .",
    "then the representation tells us that @xmath59 $ ] if @xmath60 . obviously this potential is completely independent of @xmath18 : @xmath61 in typical applications ( see below )",
    ", @xmath58 equals the planck mass @xmath62 so that @xmath63 is constant for @xmath64 .",
    "is one of our main results .",
    "it shows that the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point has a characteristic impact on the effective potential of the conformal factor : regardless of all details of the rg trajectory , the potential is completely flat for small @xmath18 .",
    "the interpretation of this result is that for @xmath60 the cost of energy ( euclidean action ) of a sphere with radius @xmath18 does not depend on @xmath18",
    ". spheres of any radius smaller than @xmath65 are on an equal footing .",
    "this is exactly the kind of fractal - like behavior and scale invariance one would expect near the ngfp @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that except for the decoupling relation no approximation went into the derivation of this result .",
    "it is an exact consequence of the assumed asymptotic safety , the existence of a ngfp governing the short distance behavior .",
    "neither has the theory space been truncated nor have any fields been excluded from the quantization ( such as in conformally reduced gravity the transverse tensors , for instance , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the basis of the above general argument we can not predict how precisely , or how quickly the effective potential flattens when we approach the origin .",
    "however , we expect that its derivative @xmath66 vanishes at @xmath67 .",
    "this has an important physical implication . in general , possible vacuum states of the system ( the `` universe '' ) can be found from the effective field equation @xmath68 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath6-type groundstate candidates have a radius @xmath69 at which @xmath70 .",
    "thus we see that thanks to the ngfp a vanishing radius @xmath71 has become a vacuum candidate , the derivative of @xmath72 vanishes there .",
    "( to qualify as the true vacuum it should be the global minimum . )",
    "hence the universe has an at least metastable stationary state with @xmath67 , i.e. a state with a vanishing metric expectation value @xmath73 . in this state gravity",
    "is in a _ phase of unbroken diffeomorphism invariance _",
    ", see ref .",
