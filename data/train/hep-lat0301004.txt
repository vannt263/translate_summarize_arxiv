    "the problem of the dynamical restoration of a gauge symmetry  ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) has received considerable attention in the recent 10 years , because of the problem of introducing a chiral gauge theory in the lattice .",
    "although the ginsparg - wilson  @xcite method has somehow superseded this approach , the question remains an interesting one .",
    "naively , the problem could seem a trivial one  @xcite : the non gauge - invariant terms in the action generate a high - temperature - like gauge - invariant expansion with a finite radius of convergence .",
    "the subtle question is whether the radius of convergence of this expansion will remain finite in the continuum limit or not . in this letter",
    ", we want to address a related , but different question , namely , the generation of a local invariance in the low - temperature ( broken - symmetry ) phase of a system without any explicitly gauge - invariant term in the action .",
    "we have found this intriguing phenomenon in a numerical study of a simplified version of the double - exchange model  @xcite(dem ) , one of the most general models for magnetism in condensed matter physics , still under active investigation  @xcite .",
    "the local invariance does not follow from a high - temperature - like expansion , but from the infinite degeneracy of the ground - state ( see next section ) , which occurs at a unique value of the control parameter at zero temperature , then extending to a finite region of the phase diagram at finite temperature .",
    "this phenomenon reminds one of the so - called quantum - critical point phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the model using monte carlo simulations and finite - size scaling techniques  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the critical exponents are fully compatible with the ones  @xcite of the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) rp@xmath0 model in three dimensions  @xcite , which has an explicit local z@xmath2 invariance .",
    "this might not be surprising , given the strong similarities in the ground - state of both models ( see next section ) .",
    "however , the fact that one can explicitly show that there is a universality class associated to the afm - rp@xmath0 model is puzzling .",
    "indeed , the most ambitious formulation of the universality hypothesis states that the critical properties of a system are fully determined by the space dimensionality and its symmetry groups at high - temperature ( @xmath3 ) and low - temperature ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "moreover , systems with a locally isomorphic @xmath5 are expected to have the same critical behavior . in our case , @xmath3=o(3 ) , and from our numerical study @xmath4 seems to be o(2 )  @xcite , although the o(2 ) residual symmetry could be also broken ( to o(1)=z@xmath2 ) . in the former case",
    ", the universality class should be the one of the o(3 ) non - linear @xmath6 model , while in the latter case one expects o(4 ) non - linear @xmath6 model - like behavior  @xcite .",
    "our results are definitely incompatible with an o(3)/o(2 ) scheme of symmetry breaking , and very hardly compatible with an o(4)/o(3 ) ( locally isomorphic to o(3)/o(1 ) ) scheme .    in recent years",
    ", the universality hypothesis ( as stated above ) has been challenged in a number of frustrated , chiral models  @xcite . yet",
    ", detailed numerical simulations have shown that typical transitions are weakly first - order  @xcite , which is hardly surprising , because the typical critical exponents proposed for chiral systems  @xcite are fairly similar to the effective exponents one expects in weak first - order transitions  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we have no doubt that the transition here studied is continuous , but we have no alternative explanation for our results .",
    "although some powerful techniques have been developed  @xcite for the double - exchange model  @xcite ( involving dynamical fermions ) , lattice sizes beyond @xmath7 are extremely hard to study with the present generations of computers .",
    "thus , one may turn to the simplified version proposed by anderson  @xcite , where a purely bosonic hamiltonian is considered .",
    "this simplified model has been recently studied  @xcite by extensive monte carlo simulation . yet",
    ", previous studies missed several phases in the phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ figphasediag ] and below ) .",
    "specifically , we consider a three dimensional cubic lattice of side @xmath8 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the dynamical variables , @xmath9 , live on the sites of the lattice and are three - component vectors of unit modulus .",
    "the hamiltonian contains the anderson version of the double - exchange model plus an antiferromagnetic first - neighbor heisenberg interaction  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 means first - neighbor sites on the lattice .",
    "the partition function reads @xmath12\\ , \\e^{-h / t}\\ , , \\label{particion}\\ ] ] the integration measure being the standard rotationally - invariant measure on the sphere . in the following",
    ", expectation values will be indicated as @xmath13 .",
    "the zero temperature limit is dominated by the spin configurations that minimize the energy .",
    "exploratory monte carlo simulations showed that these configurations have a bipartite structure .",
    "indeed , let us call a lattice site even or odd , according to the parity of the sum of its coordinates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 even or odd ) .",
    "then the spins on the ( say ) even lattice are all parallel , while the spins on the odd sublattice are randomly placed on a cone of angle @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) around the direction of the even lattice .",
    "the energy when @xmath18 goes to zero is simply @xmath19 now , @xmath20 is obtained by minimizing @xmath21 . for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , meaning a ferromagnetic vacuum . for @xmath24 ,",
    "one has @xmath25 ( ferrimagnetic vacuum ) , while for all @xmath26 , it is @xmath27 ( antiferrimagnetic vacuum ) .",
    "the full antiferromagnetic configuration ( @xmath28 ) is never stable at zero temperature .",
    "the @xmath29 point is very peculiar : much like for the afm - rp@xmath0 model  @xcite , spins in the even sublattice are randomly aligned or anti - aligned with the ( say ) @xmath30 axis , while the spins in the odd sublattice are randomly placed in the @xmath31 plane . since spins in the two sublattices are perpendicular to each other , one can arbitrarily reverse every spin .",
    "a local z@xmath2 symmetry is dynamically generated and , as we will see , it extends to finite temperatures .",
    "an operational definition of dynamical generation of a gauge symmetry is the following .",
    "one must calculate the correlation - length for non gauge - invariant operators ( @xmath32 ) and compare it to the correlation - length corresponding to gauge - invariant quantities ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "in the continuum - limit ( @xmath34 ) , one should have @xmath35 .",
    "we have checked that the correlation - length associated to the spin - spin correlation function ( non z@xmath2 gauge - invariant ) is smaller than @xmath36 for all temperatures at @xmath29 .",
    "the alert reader will notice that the symmetry group at the point @xmath37 is rather a local o(2 ) , besides the local z@xmath2 previously discussed .",
    "however , the associated correlation - length at finite temperature grows enormously when approaching the critical temperature ( tenths of lattice - spacings already at @xmath38 ) , and probably diverges .",
    "more details on this will be given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a further analytical evidence for this fact can be obtained by performing a taylor expansion of the action at @xmath39 assuming that @xmath40 , which just vanishes at @xmath39 and zero temperature , is small : @xmath41 we can assume that this expansion has a finite radius of convergence and so we can extend this series to the non zero temperature region .",
    "notice that the first term in the expansion is just the afm - rp@xmath0 hamiltonian modified by terms that are no longer gauge invariant ( those with odd powers in the scalar product ) .",
    "we can argue that those terms , which break explicitly the gauge invariance , are irrelevant operators , in the renormalization group sense , at the pm to afm - rp@xmath0 critical point and so , our model at finite temperature should belong to the same universality class as the afm - rp@xmath0 model .",
    "obviously , were the transition of the first order , the argument would not apply .    in the z@xmath2 gauge - invariant phase , the vectorial magnetizations defined as @xmath42 are zero .",
    "thus , we define proper order parameters , invariant under that gauge symmetry , in terms of the spin field , @xmath9 and the related spin-2 tensor field ( which is @xmath43 invariant ) : @xmath44 then we define : @xmath45 the different phases we find ( see  @xcite for details ) are : paramagnetic , ferromagnetic ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , ferrimagnetic ( @xmath48 ) , antiferrimagnetic ( @xmath49 ) , antiferromagnetic ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) , and rp@xmath0 ( @xmath52 but with vanishing vectorial magnetizations ) .",
    "the phase diagram can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figphasediag ] . notice the strong similarities of the point @xmath53 with a quantum critical point  @xcite",
    ". a detailed analysis of this phase diagram will appear soon  @xcite .",
    "let us end this section by defining the observables actually used in the simulation .",
    "they are obtained in terms of the fourier transform of the tensor fields : @xmath54 and their propagators @xmath55 where @xmath56 notice that @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "then we have the usual ( @xmath59 ) and staggered ( @xmath60 ) susceptibilities , @xmath61 having those two order parameters , we must expect the following behavior for the propagators in the thermodynamic limit , in the scaling region and for @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are correlation - lengths , @xmath66 is the reduced temperature and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constants . on the other hand , the anomalous dimensions @xmath70 and @xmath71 need not be equal : we can relate them to the dimensions of the composite operators following the standard way : @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and in general @xmath74 .    to study the propagators ( [ myprop ] ) on a finite lattice , we need to use the minimal momentum propagators @xmath75 with those quantities in hand , one can define a finite - lattice correlation - length  @xcite for the staggered , and non staggered sectors : @xmath76    other quantities of interest are the dimensionless cumulants @xmath77 besides the above quantities , we also measure the energy ( [ accion ] ) , which is used in a reweighting method  @xcite , and temperature derivatives of operators through their crossed correlation with the energy .",
    "for an operator @xmath78 that diverges as @xmath79 , its mean value at temperature @xmath18 in a size @xmath8 lattice can be written , in the critical region , assuming the finite - size scaling ansatz as  @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a smooth scaling function and @xmath82 is the universal leading correction - to - scaling exponent .    in order to eliminate the unknown @xmath81 function ,",
    "we use the method of quotients  @xcite .",
    "one studies the behavior of the operator of interest in two lattice sizes , @xmath8 and @xmath83 ( typically @xmath84 ) : @xmath85 then one chooses a value of the reduced temperature @xmath86 , such that the correlation - length in units of the lattice size is the same in both lattices  @xcite .",
    "one readily obtains @xmath87 notice that the matching condition @xmath88 can be easily tuned with a reweighting method .",
    "the usual procedure consists on fixing @xmath84 , and obtaining the above quotients for several @xmath8 values in order to perform an infinite volume extrapolation .    in order to obtain the critical exponents , we use as operators @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "notice that several quantities can play the role of the correlation - length in eq .",
    "( [ quo ] ) : @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this simply changes the amplitude of the scaling corrections , which will turn out to be quite useful .",
    "another interesting quantity is the shift of the apparent critical point ( _ i.e. _ @xmath95 ) , with respect to the real critical point : @xmath96",
    "we have studied the model ( [ accion ] ) in lattices @xmath97 and @xmath98 , with a monte carlo simulation at @xmath29 .",
    "the algorithm has been a standard metropolis with 2 hits per spin .",
    "the trial new spin is chosen randomly in the sphere .",
    "the probability of finally changing the spin at least once is about @xmath99 .",
    "we have carried out 20 million full - lattice sweeps ( measuring every 2 sweeps ) at each lattice size at @xmath100 .",
    "for the @xmath101 lattice we have also performed 20 million sweeps at @xmath102 .",
    "the largest autocorrelation time measured is about 1400 sweeps ( corresponding to @xmath60 ) . to ensure the thermalization",
    "we have discarded a minimum of 150 times the autocorrelation time .",
    "the computation was made on the rtn3 cluster of 28 1.9ghz pentiumiv processors at the university of zaragoza and the total simulation time was equivalent to 11 months of a single processor .",

    "@xmath104 is the quality - of - fit parameter .",
    "our final values are the bold values . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first step , as usual , is to estimate @xmath82 from eq .",
    "( [ shiftbeta ] ) . for this",
    ", one needs a rough - estimate of @xmath105 . since our data for the quotient of @xmath91 using @xmath65 as correlation - length show very small scaling corrections ( see fig .",
    "[ figexponentes ] ) , one can temporally choose @xmath106 and proceed with the determination of @xmath82 . having four possible dimensionless quantities , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    ", we can perform a joint fit to eq .",
    "( [ shiftbeta ] ) constrained to yield the same @xmath103 .",
    "this largely improves the accuracy of the final estimate .",
    "the full covariance matrix is used in the fit , and errors are determined by the increase of @xmath111 by one - unit .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ figomega ] and table  [ tableomega ] .",
    "although scaling corrections are clearly visible , good fits are obtained from @xmath112 .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath113 we are now ready for the infinite volume extrapolation of the critical exponents . as usual , one needs to worry about higher - order scaling corrections .",
    "here we shall follow a conservative criterion : we shall perform the fit to eq .",
    "( [ quo ] ) only for @xmath114 , and observe what happens varying @xmath115 .",
    "once we found a @xmath115 for which the fit is acceptable and the infinite volume extrapolation for @xmath114 and @xmath116 are compatible within errors , we take the extrapolated value from the @xmath114 fit , and the error from the @xmath116 fit .",
    "our results can be found in fig .",

    "our results in the low temperature phase  @xcite seem to indicate that the scheme of symmetry - breaking is o(3)/o(2 ) , which contradicts universality .",
    "most puzzling is the excellent agreement between the present results and the estimates for the afm - rp@xmath0 model .",
    "this seems to indicate that the afm - rp@xmath0 model really represents a new universality class in three dimensions , in plain contradiction with the universality - hypothesis ( at least in its more general form ) .",
    "this seems to imply that the local isomorphism of @xmath141 is not enough to guarantee a common universality class .",
    "of course , it could happen that we were seeing only _ effective _ exponents and that in the @xmath142 limit a more standard picture arises .",
    "yet , we do not find any obvious reason for two very different models to have such a similar _ effective _ exponents .",
    "another intriguing effect is that the augmented local @xmath43 symmetry of the point @xmath53 extends to the finite temperature plane , which is recalling a quantum critical point  @xcite .",
