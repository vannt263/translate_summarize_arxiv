    "the study of structural , mechanical , electronic and magnetic properties of intermetallics is an important area of research from both application and fundamental points of view .",
    "although a vast majority of intermetallics are metals , there exist a few semiconductor intermetallic systems also .",
    "the value of the electrical band gap in these intermetallic semiconductors strongly depend upon the nature of hybridization between the orbitals of the constituent atoms .",
    "few intermetallic compounds which are reported to have a band gap , include fesi , fesb@xmath1 , rual@xmath1 , fega@xmath0 , ruga@xmath0 and ruin@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these are considered to be the promising materials for applications in infrared and thermal devices due to their low band gaps .    in these hybridization induced semiconductors ,",
    "the hybridization is mainly due to the mixing of d orbitals of transition metal atom with s and p orbitals of the p block elements .",
    "thus , the choice of the elements , their composition and structure of the compounds decide the hybridization strength and eventually the property of the compound .",
    "the narrow band gap coupled with a large density of states near the valence band edge in these intermetallics play an important role in increasing their seebeck coefficient .",
    "for example , fesb@xmath1 has a band gap of 0.05 ev and experimental result shows that this material possesses the highest thermoelectric power of -45000 @xmath2v / k @xcite .",
    "this is quite large as compared to bi@xmath1te@xmath0 ( 250 @xmath3/k ) based conventional thermoelectric materials @xcite . in case of fega@xmath0 , large negative seebeck coefficient of 350 @xmath3/k for single crystal @xcite and 563 @xmath3/k for polycrystalline samples @xcite have been measured .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that a small percentage of doping in the intermetallics enhances their thermoelectric power @xcite and may also influence their electronic @xcite and magnetic properties@xcite as well .",
    "along with the existence of a narrow band gap and their associated applications , the tm based intermetallics have also attracted attention because of a more fundamental aspect due to the role of coulomb correlation in the d band of tm electrons . in some of the systems like fesi , fesb@xmath1 and fega@xmath0 ,",
    "the influence of strong electron - electron correlation on their electronic properties has already been observed @xcite .    among the tm based narrow band semiconductors",
    ", fega@xmath0 has been one of the well studied materials , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "band gap of this material is found to be in the range of 0.3 - 0.5 ev , which has been obtained by various experimental techniques such as temperature dependent resistivity , temperature dependent magnetic succeptibility , and a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy ( ipes ) measurements@xcite .",
    "first - principles based electronic structure calculations with local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) give similar value for the band gap@xcite . the close agreement between the experimental and calculated (",
    "using lda and gga ) values of band gap suggests that the coulomb correlation may be weak in this system .",
    "however , recently , the results of angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements reported by arita _ _ et al.__@xcite have shown that there is a large mismatch between the measured and calculated ( using lda ) band dispersions at the zone centre .",
    "they have also performed the electronic structure calculations by using lda + u approach , where they have found that a coulomb correlation u@xmath43 ev on fe 3d electrons is necessary to reproduce the band dispersion similar to that obtained from arpes measurement .",
    "it is to be noted that calculation with lda approximation showed no existance of magnetic moment on fega@xmath0 rendering to be non - magnetic .",
    "however , in the results of two recent experiments , namely ( a ) neutron diffraction @xcite and ( b ) muon spin rotation @xcite , existence of finite magnetic moment on fe atom in fega@xmath0 have been observed .",
    "theoretical results reported by yin _",
    "_ have shown that with the incorporation of coulomb correlation through u within the lda+u approximation , a magnetic moment on fe atom is generated .",
    "for u = 2 ev , the magnitude of the moment is 0.62 @xmath5 per fe atom .",
    "it is also important to note that the band gap of fega@xmath0 remains unchanged up to u = 2 ev and for larger value of u ( @xmath4 3.0 ev ) , fega@xmath0 becomes metallic .",
    "though geometric , electronic and magnetic properties of fega@xmath0 at ambient conditions are reported in literature , there is no experimental studies on the properties of this material under high pressure . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only one computational study on the high pressure properties of fega@xmath0 is available in literature , which predicts that this material undergoes a semiconductor to metal transition ( smt ) at an applied pressure of 25 gpa @xcite .",
    "the application of external pressure provides a very useful means to modify the nature of bonding and the strength of hybridization between the fe d and ga s and p orbitals , resulting in changes in the unit cell volume , electronic and magnetic structures , without introducing any extra chemical element , charge carriers or defects .",
    "comparison of the experimental structural parameters obtained from high pressure xrd with first principle calculations also provides a good means to predict the electronic and magnetic properties at high pressure from calculations .",
    "thus , in order to study and understand the structural properties of fega@xmath0 at high pressures , we have performed x - ray diffraction measurements of polycrystalline powder sample of fega@xmath0 under high pressure up to 33 gpa .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) for this system has been obtained from the xrd data .",
    "we have also carried out electronic structure calculations , based on density functional theory ( dft ) with generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , for this system under high pressure .",
    "it is already established from previous studies that coulomb correlation plays a significant role in determining the electronic properties of fega@xmath0 at ambient pressure .",
    "thus , we have also performed calculations by employing gga + u approach to account for the effect of coulomb correlation in fega@xmath0 .",
    "our analysis shows that at high pressure , the lattice parameters obtained from gga calculations are significantly underestimated in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , it has been observed that with increasing pressure , this deviation increases monotonically .",
    "we have found that incorporation of coulomb correlation through u in gga + u approach , yields a better agreement between the experimental and calculated lattice parameters .",
    "in addition , our results suggest that the value of u required to reproduce the experimental lattice parameters increases with pressure .",
    "the present study clearly signifies the importance of u in fega@xmath0 system at high pressure .",
    "however , this does not indicate tem is being strongly correlated , as our calculations show that there is also a proportionate increase in the bandwidth of fe 3d electrons due to the application of pressure .",
    "it has been predicted from the calculaion , that fega@xmath0 undergoes metal to insulator transition at high pressure which has been , consequently , confirmed by high pressure resistivity measurements .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in the next section , we describe the experimental and computational details employed in the present work .",
    "section iii contains the results and discussion , and in section iv , we have concluded our results .",
    "polycrystalline fega@xmath0 powder has been prepared in an induction furnace ( frequency 15 khz ) using high purity elements ( fe = 99.98@xmath6 , ga = 99.999@xmath6 ) in 99.999@xmath6 pure ar gas atmosphere .",
    "after preparation , the sample was annealed for 5 days at 600@xmath7c inside a quartz ampule , which was vacuum sealed at @xmath8 mbar pressure .",
    "chemical composition of the sample has been measured by synchrotron based energy dispersive x - ray fluorescence ( ed - xrf ) technique at bl-16 ( indus-2 , rrcat ) .",
    "preliminary structural characterization was done by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurement at ambient pressure using cu @xmath9 source in a bruckers discover d8 system . in order to carry out high pressure xrd measurements , the sample was ground into fine powder .",
    "the sample was then wrapped inside a mo foil and annealed in a vacuum sealed ( @xmath8 mbar pressure ) quartz ampule at 400@xmath7c for 6 hours , to remove the strain introduced while powdering it .",
    "the binary phase diagram of fe - ga @xcite reveals that the fega@xmath0 phase is incongruently melting and hence can not be grown directly from its melt .",
    "hence we adopted flux growth method to grow the single crystal from a ga - rich melt composition .",
    "the starting materials were of high purity fe in rod form and ga taken in the fe : ga ratio 1:22 , in a high quality recrystallized alumina crucible .",
    "the alumina crucible was then subsequently sealed in a quartz ampoule and placed in a resistive heating box type furnace .",
    "the temperature of the furnace was raised to 1050@xmath7c and held at this temperature for 24  h to enable proper homogenization .",
    "the temperature of the furnace was then cooled down to 600@xmath7c over a period of 3 weeks .",
    "the excess flux was centrifuged and the grown crystals were extracted from the crucible .",
    "the crystals were of reasonably big size amounting to 4  @xmath10  5  @xmath10  3  mm@xmath11 .",
    "high pressure xrd measurements have been performed up to @xmath12 33 gpa pressure at extreme conditions xrd ( ecxrd ) beamline ( bl-11 ) , indus-2 , rrcat @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we used the angle dispersive mode with a wavelength ( @xmath13)= 0.5692  .",
    "a mar345 imaging plate system has been used to collect two dimensional xrd patterns .",
    "the calibration of the x - ray photon energy and the distance between the sample and the image plate was been carried out by using standard lab@xmath14 and ceo@xmath1 samples . fega@xmath0 and",
    "a small amount of au ( used as a pressure marker ) was loaded inside a 150 @xmath15 hole drilled in a pre - indented tungsten gasket ( with 40 @xmath15 thickness ) of a diamond anvil cell .",
    "a methanol@xmath16ethanol mixture with a ratio of 4:1 was used as the pressure transmitting medium and the pressure inside the cell has been determined by using the known equation of state of gold .",
    "spectra were recorded when pressure has been increased . to ascertain the consistency of the observation , we have repeated the measurement on fega@xmath0 two times .",
    "we have also performed high pressure resistivity measurement on fega@xmath0 single crystal by four probe method in the range of pressure from ambient to 9 gpa .",
    "this measurement on pre - compacted single crystal sample ( 2mm@xmath101.5mm@xmath100.1 mm ) has been carried out in an opposed bridgman anvil device .",
    "a pyrophyllite gasket of thickness 200 @xmath15 with a central hole of 3 @xmath17 in diameter has been used to contain the sample .",
    "bismuth was used for the pressure calibration along with steatite as a pressure transmitting medium . for four probe resistance measurements ,",
    "stainless steel wires with a diameter of 40 @xmath15 have been used .",
    "a constant current of 1 @xmath18 was passed through two outer leads by keithley source meter and voltage drop across inner two leads was measured using keithley nanovoltmeter at each value of pressure with two minutes of pressure soaking time .    to study and understand the variation of geometric and electronic structures of fega@xmath0 under pressure , we have performed density functional theory ( dft ) based electronic structure calculations by using vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite within the framework of the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method . for exchange - correlation",
    "functional , we have used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) given by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) @xcite .",
    "the energy cut - off of plane waves ( basis set ) was chosen to be 400 ev . for brillouin zone integration",
    ", we have used monkhorst - pack scheme with @xmath19-meshes of @xmath20 .",
    "the convergence criteria in scf cycle has been chosen to be @xmath21 ev .",
    "the geometric structures have been optimized by minimizing the forces on individual atoms with the criteria that the total force on each atom is below 10@xmath22 ev /  . to incorporate the effects of strong electron correlation , if any present in the system , we have also carried out similar calculations by employing gga + u approach . in this work , we have used u = 1 to 6 ev for the 3d orbitals of fe atoms .",
    "1 ( a ) shows the xrd pattern of fega@xmath0 obtained using cu @xmath9 source . the results obtained from rietveld refinement of the xrd data confirm that our sample has tetragonal crystal structure with _ a _ = 6.267  and _ c _ = 6.560  and it belongs to @xmath23 space group symmetry .",
    "the ball and stick model of this system is shown in fig . 1 ( b )",
    ". the wyckoff positions of fe and ga atoms , obtained from the rietveld refinement of our data are shown in table .",
    "these parameters match quite well with the values reported in the literature @xcite .    .",
    "the xrd patterns at various pressures are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this figure ,",
    "au peak positions are marked by dashed lines and the arrow indicates the direction of progress of the experiment . during the high pressure xrd measurements ,",
    "no new peaks were detected .",
    "this confirms that no new crystalline phase appears in this pressure range .",
    "however , a clear shift of the diffraction peaks corresponding to the planes in fega@xmath0 has been observed with increase of pressure .",
    "upto a pressure of 19.7 gpa , the peak intensity corresponding to fega@xmath0 is strong enough to evaluate the lattice parameters by le - bail fitting , but beyond 19.7 gpa , the intensity of the peaks reduces drastically and eventually vanishes at a pressure of 26.6 gpa .",
    "this indicates that significant disorder sets in at 19.7 gpa and the system starts amorphizing at a pressure beyond @xmath12 20 gpa .",
    "we thus discuss the results in two parts ; ( a ) from ambient pressure to a pressure of @xmath12 20 gpa , where the structure is crystalline and le - bail fitting could be done ; and ( b ) beyond @xmath12 20 gpa , where the system becomes disordered and amorphizes . as the pressure is released , the system again becomes crystalline with tetragonal structure at ambient pressure .",
    "however , it is observed that the peaks are significantly broader and with much lower intensity , as compared to those of starting ambient diffraction pattern .",
    "it signifies that although the system regains crystalline structure but does not recovered fully .",

    "the variations of unit cell volume with pressure are shown in fig .",
    "3 . from this figure",
    ", we find that there is a monotonic decrease in the volume of unit cell with applied pressure .",
    "we have performed dft based ab - initio calculation within the gga approximation .",
    "the computational details have been discussed in the previous section . the calculated change in the unit cell volume with pressure",
    "is also shown in fig .",
    "3 along with the experimental results .",
    "comparison of experimental and calculated results shows that although the calculated and experimental values of the cell volume @xmath24 is very close ( @xmath25v = 0.0015% ) at atmospheric pressure , with an increase in pressure , the calculated values of the unit cell volume are smaller than the experimental values .",
    "further , this difference between the experimental and the calculated value increases monotonically with increase in pressure .",
    "to quantify the difference between the experimental and the calculated results , we have fitted both the experimental and calculated data with the third order birch - murnaghan equation of state    @xmath26\\\\\\left[1+\\frac{3}{4}\\left({{b^{\\prime}}_0}-4\\right)\\left((\\frac{v_0}{v}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)\\bigg]\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath27 is the bulk modulus at ambient pressure of fega@xmath0 , @xmath28 is first order derivative of @xmath27 with respect to pressure and @xmath29 is the volume of unit cell at ambient pressure .",
    "the experimental and calculated values of @xmath27 are 140 gpa and 103 gpa respectively , @xmath28 are 6.60 and 4.34 respectively , and @xmath29 are 259.0 and 259.4 @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the difference in the calculated and experimental unit cell volume is only 0.0015% , furthermore our calculated bulk modulus at ambient pressure matches very well with earlier calculated report by osorio - gullin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .    to understand and reconcile the mismatch of experimental unit cell volume at high pressure with calculated ones ,",
    "we have carried out the full structural optimization of fega@xmath0 using gga+u method with u = 1 , 2 , ... 6 ev for fe 3d orbitals .",
    "we have observed that at high pressures , we need high u values to match the calculated unit cell volume with the experimental volume and this value of u increases with an increase in the applied pressure .",
    "the values of u required at 4 , 9 , 15 and 20 gpa pressure to reproduce the calculated unit cell volume are  3 , 4 , 5 and 6 ev respectively .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 further shows that there is no significant difference in the unit cell volume for calculations made with u = 0 to 3 ev . at each pressure",
    "( 0 , 4 , 9 , 15 and 20 gpa ) the unit cell volume for u values ranging from 0 to 3 ev are almost same , but it differs significantly beyond 3 ev .",
    "our analysis thus clearly suggests the importance of u in this system at high pressures . however extrapolating the value of u at high pressure to ambient pressure ( as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4 ) we arrive at a value of u @xmath12 2 ev .",
    "earlier observations regarding the role of u within the gga+u level of calculations in determining the equilibrium lattice parameters have been reported in case of other strongly correlated 3d and 4f systems . at ambient pressure , in ceo@xmath1",
    ", it is reported that lda calculations underestimate the lattice parameters . however , in the lda + u calculation with u = 65 ev , the match between the calculated and experimental lattice parameters is good @xcite . in a high pressure report on lamno@xmath0 , it is shown that lda+u calculations give better bond length estimation as compared to lda @xcite .",
    "one another report on feo and mno also shows that lda+u calculation gives a better matching with experimentally obtained structural parameters at high pressure as compared to lda calculations@xcite .",
    "the role of finite u at ambient pressure in fega@xmath0 has been already reported in some recent experiments .",
    "et al . _ have carried out arpes study of single crystal fega@xmath0 and have noticed that a better agreement of the experimentally obtained dispersion curves with calculations is obtained for lda+u calculations with u = 3 ev @xcite .",
    "results of calculations reported by yin _",
    "_ show that within the lda+u approximation , the band gap of fega@xmath0 is nearly unchanged for u = 0 to 2 ev @xcite .",
    "they have also observed that the d bands are almost flat with very small dispersion in k space , suggesting that the d electrons are localized with high effective mass .",
    "therefore correlation plays an important role and they have used lda+u approach in their work .",
    "have also reported a small magnetic moment ( @xmath12 0.62 @xmath5 ) at u = 2 ev through their calculations .",
    "recently gamza _ et al .",
    "_ have observed a complex magnetic ordering in fega@xmath0 experimentally by neutron diffraction measurements@xcite .",
    "results of muon spin rotation experiment by storchak _",
    "_ also show the presence of magnetic moment on fe atoms @xcite .",
    "all these reported experimental and theoretical data indicate the significant role of u and hence a significant coulomb correlation at ambient pressure in fega@xmath0 , which is in the range of 2 - 3 ev .",
    "this value matches with our extrapolated value ( shown in inset of fig .",
    "it is also worth mentioning at this stage that the older reports by hausserman _",
    "_ @xcite and imai _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where the calculations have been carried out with u = 0 , to obtain the band gap and the lattice parameters of fega@xmath0 , a good matching have been observed between experiments and the calculations .",
    "however recent neutron diffraction measurement @xcite , muon spin resonance @xcite and our high pressure xrd data can not be explained without the consideration of significant on - site coulomb correlation .",
    "this apparent contradition can be easily resolved by the fact that calculation of the band gap and lattice parameter at ambient pressure do not show any significant variation upto u @xmath30 2 ev .    but the observed increase in the value of u with pressure does not necessarily indicate that there is an increase in the correlation on fe 3d electrons in fega@xmath0 with pressure .",
    "the other important factor is the variation of the bandwidth ( @xmath25 ) with pressure that is related to electron delocalization and @xmath31 is the parameter that determines the importance of correlation @xcite . to understand the effect of pressure on the fe 3d bandwidth , we have plotted the fe 3d partial density of states resolved into up and down spins in fig .",
    "5(a ) . the total and fe partial dos",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) . for comparison , the total and fe 3d partial dos at ambient pressure calculation with u = 0 ev",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "5(c ) , which matches with earlier reported electronic structure calculation quite well @xcite .",
    "the fe 3d bandwidth increases from @xmath12 3 ev at ambient pressure to @xmath12 8 ev at 20 gpa , which is an increase of a factor of @xmath12 2.5 .",
    "the value of u varies from 2 - 3 ev at ambient pressure to 6 ev at 20 gpa which corresponds to an increase by a factor between 2 and 3 .",
    "the significance of u at high pressure can be understood from the physical argument that with the application of pressure , the atoms come closer to each other , and the orbitals of atoms are compressed . as the orbitals are reduced , the on site coulomb repulsion on fe 3d electrons is increased .",
    "simultaniously , as the orbitals come close , the overlap between fe 3d orbitals also increases .",
    "this increase in overlap increases the bandwidth , thereby enhancing the itinerancy of the fe d electrons .",
    "these two competing effects lead to a value of @xmath31 which remains nearly constant throughout the pressure range applied in this work .",
    "pressure induced reduction in the atomic sizes and hence localization of the electron orbitals has been observed by paszkowicz _",
    "_ in mn atoms of camno@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "another report by moreno _",
    "et al . _ on mnas",
    "nanocrystal shows that induced strain in the system confine the d electrons and increase electron correlation enhancing the localization of 3d orbitals @xcite .",
    "similar type of localization have been observed in mossbauer experiment by kantor _",
    "@xcite where it is reported that there is an increase in the hyperfine field in feo with applied pressure and this hyperfine field is related to an increase in the magnetic moment .",
    "in contrast in mg@xmath32fe@xmath33o @xcite , it has been found that @xmath34 is one order larger than @xmath35 , which indicates the dominance of band width over correlation at high pressure and points out towards the increased itinerancy of the d electrons of tm atoms .",
    "the increase of band overlap and hence itinerency with pressure has also been reported in several systems , for example , lamno@xmath0 @xcite , curium metal @xcite etc .",
    "however in our study , we have observed that in fega@xmath0 , @xmath34 ( @xmath12 0.083 ) is close to @xmath35 ( @xmath12 0.1 ) , which indicates that at high pressure , increase in correlation u and itinerancy are of the same magnitude and hence equally important in this system .",
    "electronic structure calculations also show that at a pressure of 4 gpa , [ fig . 5 ( b ) ] finite density of states is present at fermi level , indicating a transition from semiconductor to metal .",
    "we thus conclude that for matching of the experimental unit cell volume at high pressures with our calculations , the finite u in fe 3d electrons incorporated in our gga+u calculations , significantly modifies the electronic structure at high pressures , resulting in a semiconductor to metal transition at a pressure of @xmath12 4 gpa , which is significantly lower than earlier theoretical prediction of 25 gpa by osorio - gullin _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . to be certain about this phenomenon , we have performed pressure dependent resistivity measurement on fega@xmath0 single crystal upto a maximum pressure of 9 gpa .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "6 ( full region is not shown ) .",
    "the data show a sharp decrease in resistance around 4 gpa over a continous decreasing background resistance .",
    "this sharp change in slope around 4 gpa is attributed to the semiconductor to metal transition .",
    "this further confirms the role of u in fega@xmath0 for the determination of its physical properties .",
    "the calculated bond lengths at high pressure with appropriate u values ( plotted in fig .",
    "6 ) also shows a sudden decrease in the fe - fe bond distsnce around a pressure of 4 gpa .",
    "this decrease in fe - fe bond distance around 4 gpa can have a correlation with the semiconductor to metal transition of fega@xmath0 .",
    "we next look at the xrd data recorded at pressures beyond 20 gpa ( fig.2 ) where the intensities of the diffraction peaks corresponding to fega@xmath0 decrease drastically and eventually vanish beyond 26.6 gpa .",
    "however , the peak intensity corresponding to au remain almost unchanged and peak positions shift as expected with pressure .",
    "this confirms that fega@xmath0 becomes increasingly disordered beyond @xmath12 20 gpa and around an applied pressure of @xmath12 26 gpa , fega@xmath0 becomes completely disordered and amorphizes .",
    "the amorphous nature of fega@xmath0 is observed upto the maximum pressure of 33.3 gpa applied in this experiment .",
    "while releasing the pressure , we find that the diffraction peaks corresponding to fega@xmath0 are observed at the same position as in the ambient pressure data before the application of pressure . however , the intensity of the fega@xmath0 diffraction peaks are reduced significantly and accompanied with significant broadening .",
    "we attribute the large disorder followed by amorphoization of fega@xmath0 to the structural instability introduced at high pressures . in the tetragonal symmetry of fega@xmath0",
    "the number of atoms , their arrangements , bondings and hybridization are quite different along the _ a _ and _ c _ axes , resulting in significantly different physical properties along the different lattice vector . as a result , hydrostatic pressure affects the different directions differently .",
    "the value of @xmath36 and @xmath37 evaluated in the pressure range of 0 - 20 gpa is 0.0088  / gpa and 0.0127  / gpa respectively .",
    "this clearly indicates that the compressibility along the xy plane is much more as compared to the z direction .    to understand the possible reason behind the observed amorphization of fega@xmath0",
    ", we analyze the crystal structure of fega@xmath0 , based on the space group and wyckoff position of the fe and ga atoms .",
    "1(b ) shows the arrangement of fe , ga1 and ga2 atoms in fega@xmath0 . in fega@xmath0 ,",
    "the fe atoms are aligned along the @xmath381,1,0@xmath39 direction forming dimers with the fe atoms placed 2.751  apart at ambient pressure , whereas along the @xmath380,0,1@xmath39 direction , these fe dimers lie at a distance of 6.546  from each other . in addition ,",
    "fe and ga1 atoms lie in the same xy plane ( [ 0,0,1 ] ) , at a distance of 2.370  , whereas there do not lie any fe and ga2 atoms in the same xz or yz plane . along lattice vector _ c _ ,",
    "two ga2 atoms lie at a distance of 2.399  ( near neighbour ) and 2.498  ( next near neighbour ) from the fe atoms with different ( x , y ) coordinates as compared to fe atom .",
    "this makes the xy plane more stiff than the xz or yz planes . on the application of pressure ,",
    "the fe and ga atoms are expected to be displaced inside the unit cell for minimizing the energy of the system , within the restrictions posed by the @xmath40 space group symmetry of fega@xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , with increase of pressure , the fe and ga1 atoms are constrained to move along the xy plane whereas the ga2 atoms can be displaced along the xy plane and the z directions .",
    "7 shows the variation of the calculated bond lengths : fe - ga1 , fe - fe and fe - ga2 ( near neighbor ) and fe - ga2 ( next near neighbor ) with pressure .",
    "these bonds are indicated in fig .",
    "with application of pressure the fe - ga1 and fe - ga2 ( near neighbour ) bond lengths decrease continiously with a slight increase above a pressure of 15 gpa .",
    "the fe - fe bond decreases all over the pressure range ( upto 25 gpa ) with two sudden fall at around 4 gpa and 20 gpa .",
    "the total change in the fe - fe bond length compared to ambient pressure is @xmath12 14% , which is an extremely large change .",
    "the sudden decrease in this bond length around 4 gpa corresponds to semiconductor to metal transition . around 20 gpa ,",
    "the large decrease in this fe - fe bond length brings the fe - fe atoms very close ( @xmath12 2.35 ) , which is less than the diameter of atomic fe at ambient pressure . further increase in applied pressure",
    "may moves the fe atoms out of [ 001 ] plane breaking the symmetry of the system and the system becomes disordered and eventually amorphoizes .",
    "the small increase in the fe - ga1 and fe - ga2 ( near neighbour ) bond distance above 15 gpa pressure is an effect of large decrease in fe - fe bondlength .",
    "the other fe - ga2 ( next near neighbor ) bond length decreases monotonically with increasing pressure showing the lattice parameter shrinking effect .",
    "high pressure xrd measurements on fega@xmath0 have been performed from ambient pressure to @xmath12 33 gpa . it has been observed that the system remains in its tetragonal structure below a pressure of @xmath12 20 gpa . in the pressure range of 0 to 20 gpa",
    "we have found a mismatch between the experimental and calculated eos at high pressure and this mismatch increases with increasing pressure . to check the origin of the mismatch , we have also performed calculation with gga+u method .",
    "results of our calculations indicate that , suitable choice of u at particular pressure reproduces the experimental eos and the value of required u increases as pressure increases .",
    "however , the increase of u at high pressure does not make the system strongly correlated , as the band width also increases in same proportion .",
    "electronic structure study shows that fega@xmath0 undergoes semiconductor to metal transition at a pressure of @xmath12 4 gpa which is at much lesser pressure than earlier predication ( 25 gpa ) , and this transition has been confirmed through our pressure dependent resistivity measurements . above @xmath12 20 gpa pressure the system starts loosing its crystallinity and gradually becomes disordered . beyond a pressure of 26.6 gpa it disorders completely and amorphizes . as the pressure is released fega@xmath0 returns to its initial tetragonal structure , but does not recovered fully .",
