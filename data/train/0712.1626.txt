    "one of the best advantages of oxides as thermoelectric materials is stability at high temperatures .",
    "thermoelectric materials are characterized by the dimensionless figure - of - merit , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent thermopower , resistivity , thermal conductivity and absolute temperature , respectively .",
    "na@xmath1coo@xmath12@xcite was found to be useful for high - temperature power generation , and a large number of researchers now study thermoelectric oxides@xcite . in particular , the layered co oxides with the cdi@xmath12-type coo@xmath12 block show large thermopower up to 1000  k with low resistivity@xcite .",
    "koshibae successfully revealed that the spin and orbital degeneracy of the @xmath13 orbitals is important to the thermopower@xcite . according to their theoretical prediction",
    ", conduction between @xmath14 and @xmath15 causes large thermopower at high temperatures in co oxides .",
    "rh oxides have been investigated for oxide thermoelectrics . because rh is just below co in the periodic table ,",
    "chemical properties of rh are expected to be similar to those of co. we should note that rh ions favour the low - spin state more than co ions .",
    "in fact , the layered rh oxides with the cdi@xmath12-type rho@xmath12 block are found to show similar thermoelectric properties to those of the layered co oxides@xcite .",
    "although rh is promising for oxide thermoelectrics , almost all the layered rh oxides show similar but poorer thermoelectric properties than the co oxides . here",
    "we focus on the perovskite - type rh oxide larho@xmath2 , because laco@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 and la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2 show good thermoelectric properties around room temperature@xcite . however , the thermopower of lacoo@xmath2 suddenly decreases with the spin - state transition around 500  k@xcite , which means that lacoo@xmath2-based materials can not be used above 500  k. in contrast , rh ions favour the low - spin state up to high temperature , and we expect that larho@xmath2-based materials can show better thermoelectric properties than the co analogues at high temperature .",
    "we found that rh - site substitution improves the thermoelectric properties in curho@xmath16@xcite and znrh@xmath16o@xmath17@xcite . especially in the case of curho@xmath12 , mg substitution for rh makes the system metallic , whereas cu - site substitution does not increase conductivity .",
    "thus , we substituted ni for rh in larho@xmath2 as a reference material to laco@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 .    in this paper , we present the high - temperature thermoelectric properties of perovskite larh@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 and compare them with those of laco@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "we find that the thermopower of larho@xmath2 remains large above 500  k , and that the spin state of the co@xmath5/rh@xmath5 ions determines the high - temperature thermoelectrics .",
    "polycrystalline samples of larh@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 were prepared by a solid - state reaction .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of la@xmath12o@xmath2 , rh@xmath12o@xmath2 and nio were mixed and calcined at 1273  k for 24  h in air .",
    "the calcined products were thoroughly ground , pelletized and sintered at 1373  k for 48  h in air .",
    "the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) of the samples was measured using a cuk@xmath18 radiation by a @xmath19-@xmath20 method from 10 to 100 degree .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed using magnetic property measurement system ( mpms , quantum design ) with an external field of 0.1  t from 5 to 400 k. the low - temperature resistivity and the thermopower measurements were performed in a liquid he cryostat from 4.2 to 300  k. the high - temperature resistivity and thermopower measurements were performed in vacuum from 300 to 800  k. the resistivity was measured using a conventional four - probe technique , and the thermopower was measured using a steady - state technique with a typical temperature gradient of 0.5 @xmath21 1  k. the thermal conductivity measurements were performed in a closed refrigerator using a steady - state technique from 8 to 300  k.",
    "\\(a ) shows the xrd patterns of larh@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 from @xmath22 to 0.3 .",
    "the lattice constants of these materials are shown in ( b ) .",
    "the samples are in single phase for @xmath23 0.15 , and a small amount of nio is detected above @xmath24 .",
    "we evaluate the volume fraction of nio impurity from the rietveld simulation@xcite to be less than 4% for @xmath25 .",
    "this suggests that more than 85% of the doped ni ions are substituted for rh ions in the @xmath25 sample , and we can safely neglect the effect of the nio phase .",
    "we further note that the resistivity and the thermopower systematically change up to @xmath25 ( see and ) , suggesting that the nio impurity little affects the thermoelectric properties .    in our sintering condition",
    ", we expect that ni ions are stable as divalent . on the other hand , a possible existence of ni@xmath5",

    "we obtain curie constants of 6.10@xmath27 and 1.11@xmath28  emu / mole@xmath29k for @xmath30 and @xmath31 using the curie law , respectively . adopting the @xmath32-factor of 2 ,",
    "we calculate curie constants assuming ni@xmath33 in the high - spin state to be 5.0@xmath27 and 1.0@xmath28  emu / mole@xmath29k for @xmath30 and @xmath34 , respectively . from these values , we conclude that substituted ni ions are divalent ( high spin ) in our system .",
    "conduction occurs in the rh - o network , and it is hard to see the magnetic susceptibility of rh ions .",
    "nakamura showed that both rh@xmath5 and rh@xmath6 ions are in the low - spin state@xcite . assuming that the oxygen content does not change",
    "largely , we expect that the substitution of ni@xmath33 ( the ion radius @xcite @xmath350.70   ) for rh@xmath5 ( @xmath350.67   ) creates rh@xmath6 ( @xmath350.62   ) owing to the charge neutrality condition .",
    "in other words , two rh@xmath5 ions are replaced by ni@xmath33 and rh@xmath6 ions through this substitution .",
    "then the `` average '' ion radius of the dopant is ( 0.70 + 0.62)/2=0.66  , which is nearly equal to the ion radius of rh@xmath5 . accordingly",
    "the lattice parameters are expected to depend weakly on @xmath36 , which is consistent with the data in ( b ) .",
    "a similar tendency is observed in curh@xmath37mg@xmath38o@xmath12 , where mg@xmath33(0.72   ) ions are substituted for rh@xmath5 to create rh@xmath6@xcite .",

    "( a ) shows the resistivity of larh@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 from 4.2 to 800  k. nakamura previously reported that the resistivity of larho@xmath2 was 45  @xmath39 cm at room temperature with semiconducting behaviour@xcite , which is reproduced in our measurement .",
    "the resistivity systematically decreases with @xmath36 and reaches as low as 25  m@xmath39 cm at 800  k for @xmath25 .",
    "the insulating behaviour of the resistivity at low temperature suggests that the substituted ni ions work as scattering centers .",
    "this further assures us to regard the ni ions as divalent .",
    "if the ni ions were trivalent , the system could be regarded as a solid solution of larho@xmath2 and lanio@xmath2 , in which the resistivity would be dominated by the volume fraction of metallic lanio@xmath2 .",
    "( b ) shows the thermopower of larh@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 from 4.2 to 800  k. after the thermopower drastically deareases from @xmath22 to @xmath40 , it gradually decreases with @xmath36 above @xmath34 .",
    "we should note that the sign is always positive for all the samples , which further excludes the possible existence of ni@xmath5 ions giving negative thermopower@xcite .",
    "we observe large thermopower up to 800  k , which suggests that rh ions are in the low - spin state up to high temperature",
    ".    shows the electric conductivity ( @xmath41 ) , the thermopower ( @xmath8 ) and the power factor ( @xmath42 ) at 300 and 800  k as a function of ni content @xmath36 .",
    "we clearly see that the conductivity increases with @xmath36 , which suggests that ni is a suitable dopant .",
    "the thermopower is weakly dependent on @xmath36 at high concentration .",
    "thanks to these behaviours , we obtain fairly large power factor which increases up to @xmath25 in larh@xmath0ni@xmath1o@xmath2 . recently , usui theoretically calculated the thermopower of doped larho@xmath43 as a function of carrier concentration@xcite , which agrees well with our experiment .",
    "this is quantitatively different from the power factor of conventional semiconductors , where it takes a maximum at an optimum carrier density of 10@xmath44 - 10@xmath45 @xmath46 .",
