    "<S> measured optimal geometric parameters obtained for gaussian and annular beams are in good agreement with theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> a zgv resonance amplification factor of @xmath3 is obtained with the gaussian ring . </S>",
    "<S> such source should facilitate the inspection of highly attenuating plates made of low ablation threshold materials like composites . </S>"
