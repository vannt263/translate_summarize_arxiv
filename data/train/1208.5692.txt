    "materials with potentially useful thermoelectric properties and in particular large thermopower , are currently a subject of intense research due to their potential applications , for example in refrigeration or conversion of waste heat into electricity.@xcite in addition , the thermopower is a useful tool to obtain additional insight on fundamental problems , like the kondo effect.@xcite the focus of research on thermal and thermoelectric properties has moved in the last years to nanostructures such as quantum dots,@xcite carbon nanotubes,@xcite molecules @xcite nanowires , and spin systems.@xcite as we will show , the thermopower can be a more useful tool than the conductance , to study some features of the electronic structure of kondo systems at finite energies .    electronic and thermal transport through single level quantum dots is well described by the su(2 ) anderson model , and the seebeck coefficient ( thermopower ) has been calculated using this model.@xcite in particular , costi and zlati have made a comprehensive study of the transport properties using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite a particularly interesting multilevel system is the su(4 ) anderson model , which describes quantum dots in carbon nanotubes,@xcite and silicon nanowires.@xcite in contrast to the su(2 ) case , the electron spectral density near the fermi level of the su(4 ) anderson model in the strong coupling ( kondo ) limit for nearly one electron at the dot is highly asymmetric,@xcite leading to a high derivative at the fermi energy , which ( neglecting phonon - drag effects ) in turn is proportional to the seebeck coefficient @xmath8 at low temperatures.@xcite    the interest in si nanowires increased due to the possibility of reducing the thermal conductance @xmath9 , leading to a large figure of merit @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the conductivity.@xcite recently , the conductance of si fin - type field effect transistors has been measured under an applied magnetic field @xmath12 , which leads to a crossover from an su(4 ) to an orbital su(2 ) kondo effect.@xcite the results were interpreted using the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) . in c nanotubes ,",
    "even for @xmath13 , there might be a symmetry reduction to su(2 ) due to disorder - induced intervalley mixing.@xcite    in this work , we calculate the thermopower of the anderson impurity model for two doublets , each one either spin or orbital degenerate , and infinite on - site coulomb repulsion in the kondo limit , as a function of the level splitting @xmath1 , which corresponds to the zeeman splitting for two orbitally degenerate levels in presence of an applied magnetic field , as in si fin - type field effect transistors.@xcite the symmetry of the model is su(4 ) for @xmath14 and su(2 ) for @xmath15 .",
    "we use complementary theoretical approaches : the nca,@xcite slave bosons in the mean - field approximation ( sbmfa),@xcite and fermi liquid theory for low temperatures .",
    "we also use nrg to test the other approaches in the su(2 ) limit .",
    "the sbmfa satisfies fermi liquid relationships at @xmath16 and is expected to capture the low - energy physics in the kondo limit . in turn , while nca has an error of about 15% in the value of the spectral density at very low temperature according to the friedel sum rule,@xcite it describes better the whole behavior , as shown for example in a previous comparison of nca and nrg results in the su(2 ) case.@xcite in addition , if the differential conductance @xmath17 is normalized at @xmath16 , the leading behavior of @xmath17 for small voltage and temperature @xcite agrees with alternative fermi liquid approaches,@xcite and the temperature dependence of the conductance practically coincides with the nrg result over several decades of temperature.@xcite calculations of the thermopower for more than one spin - degenerate level within the nca , compared well with experiments in some ce compounds.@xcite nrg is a very accurate technique at low temperatures.@xcite however , for two bands , the hilbert space is increased 16 times in each iteration , instead of 4 times for one band , making the technique much more demanding if the same degree of accuracy is wished .",
    "in addition , the su(4 ) symmetry can not be used to reduce the size of the matrices , since this symmetry is broken by @xmath1 .",
    "therefore we use here nrg only in the limit @xmath18 , in which only one doublet and the band that mixes with it play a significant role .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the model used .",
    "the approximations and the equation for the seebeck coefficient are described in section [ forma ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section [ res ] .",
    "section [ sum ] contains a summary and a short discussion .",
    "we start with a generalization of the anderson model for infinite on - site coulomb repulsion , which contains a singlet @xmath19 with @xmath20 ( even ) particles and two spin doublets @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the valley index ; @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) with @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) particles representing the four spin and valley degenerate states of a quantum dot created for example by depleting the density at two points of a c nanotube or in a si nanowire .",
    "the dot is connected to two conducting leads which are also spin and valley degenerate .",
    "the su(4 ) symmetry is then broken by applying a magnetic field or breaking the valley degeneracy in a simple way . in both cases , interchanging spin ( @xmath27 ) and valley ( @xmath28 ) indices if necessary",
    ", the hamiltonian can be written in the form @xmath29where @xmath30 create conduction states at the left ( @xmath31 ) or right ( @xmath32 ) lead , and @xmath33 is the hopping between the lead @xmath34 and both doublets , assumed independent of @xmath35 for simplicity .",
    "the doublets are split by an energy @xmath36 .",
    "this corresponds to the zeeman splitting when the su(4 ) symmetry of the model for @xmath7 is broken by an applied magnetic field .    while there are four spin degenerate bands of mobile electrons , depending on valley index @xmath28 or position with respect to the quantum dot ( left or right ) , for each energy @xmath37 for which there are states at the left and the right , only the linear combination @xmath38 hybridizes with the state @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the model is effectively a two - band model .",
    "we note that in the case of intervalley mixing induced by disorder in c nanotubes , the hopping elements for small magnetic field depend on the valley and lead indices.@xcite in this case , the formalism used in this work is not applicable .",
    "it seems that a full non - equilibrium formalism is needed to treat the most general case , as that developed for the conductance in ref . and sketched in ref . .",
    "the model is not applicable either for the case of magnetic impurities in c nanotubes , for which symmetry - breaking geometrical effects play an important role.@xcite",
    "in the limit of vanishing applied bias voltage and temperature difference between the leads , the electronic part of the transport coefficients can be evaluated in terms of the total spectral density at the dot @xmath39 .",
    "this is possible due to the fact that the couplings between the quantum dot and the right or left leads are proportional.@xcite if this were not the case ( as in nanotubes affected by disorder @xcite or for some molecules @xcite ) a different formalism would be needed.@xcite    the seebeck coefficient is simply given by @xcite    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the absolute value of the electronic charge and    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the fermi function , and the zero of energy is taken at the fermi energy @xmath44      to calculate the total spectral density @xmath45 that enters eqs .",

    "@xmath48 are introduced , so that the localized states are represented as @xmath49where @xmath50 is the vacuum .",
    "these pseudoparticles should satisfy the constraint @xmath51the nca solves a system of self - consistent equations to obtain the green functions of the auxiliary particles , which is equivalent to sum an infinite series of diagrams ( all those without crossings ) in the corresponding perturbation series in the hopping , and afterwards a projection on the physical subspace of the constraint is made .",
    "the formalism of the nca for this problem or similar ones is described in previous papers.@xcite in particular , the more general case of complex hoppings is treated in ref . .",
    "therefore , we do not give more details here .",
    "the application of nrg in the case of only one doublet ( @xmath52 ) has also been explained before.@xcite    in the sbmfa , the boson operators are replaced by a number @xmath53 , and the energy is minimized with respect to @xmath54 and a lagrange multiplier @xmath55 that enforces eq .",

    "taking into account the exponential variation of @xmath3 with @xmath92 one can see a semiquantitative agreement between both results in table 1 .",

    "10 of ref . .",
    "one can see that in addition to the larger value of @xmath103 , the spectral density is more asymmetric for the nca .",
    "this is probably the main reason of the factor near five between the magnitude of the dip in @xmath2 near @xmath3 calculated with nca with respect to the nrg result .",
    "part of the discrepancy is probably also due to lack of resolution at finite energies within the nrg .",
    "for example in models of two quantum dots , the split kondo peaks in the spectral density are considerably broadened , losing intensity ( fig .",
    "11 of ref . ) .",
    "another example is the plateau in the conductance @xmath94 observed at intermediate temperatures @xmath0 in transport through c@xmath104 molecules for gate voltages for which triplet states are important,@xcite which was missed in early nrg studies , but captured by the nca.@xcite more recent nrg  calculations using tricks to improve the resolution,@xcite have confirmed this plateau.@xcite    in any case , the one - level su(2 ) limit is the worst case for the nca , because the real spectral density tends to be symmetric , while the nca improves with increasing n for su(n ) models.@xcite    the absolute value of @xmath8 is exaggerated within nca for @xmath105 .",

    "<S> we calculate the thermopower of a quantum dot described by two doublets hybridized with two degenerate bands of two conducting leads , conserving orbital ( band ) and spin quantum numbers , as a function of the temperature @xmath0 and a splitting @xmath1 of the quantum dot levels which breaks the su(4 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting can be regarded as a zeeman ( spin ) or valley ( orbital ) splitting . </S>",
    "<S> we use the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) , the slave bosons in the mean - field approximation ( sbmfa ) and also the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) for large @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes transport through clean c nanotubes and in si fin - type field effect transistors , under an applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the thermopower as a function of temperature @xmath2 displays two dips that correspond to the energy scales given by the kondo temperature @xmath3 and @xmath1 and one peak when @xmath4 reaches the charge - transfer energy . </S>",
    "<S> these features are much more pronounced than the corresponding ones in the conductance , indicating that the thermopower is a more sensitive probe of the electronic structure at intermediate or high energies . at low temperatures </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 is a constant that increases strongly near the degeneracy point @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sbmfa fails to provide an accurate description of the thermopower for large @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> instead , a combination of fermi liquid relations with the quantum - dot occupations calculated within the nca gives reliable results for @xmath5 . </S>"
