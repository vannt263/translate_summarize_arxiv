    "supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) are a recently discovered subclass of high mass x - ray binaries . these sources display sporadic outbursts lasting from minutes to hours with peak luminosities of @xmath010@xmath1 - 10@xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 , and spend long time intervals at lower x - ray luminosities , ranging from @xmath010@xmath4  erg  s@xmath3 to @xmath010@xmath5  erg  s@xmath3",
    ". proposed models to interpret the sfxt behavior generally involve accretion onto a neutron star ( ns ) immersed in the clumpy wind of its supergiant companion @xcite .",
    "the x - ray luminosity during lower activity states is likely due to accretion onto the ns at much reduced rate than in outburst @xcite .",
    "here we report on the first long , high sensitivity observation ( @xmath032  ks ) of the sfxt 16479 .",
    "this observation was carried out shortly after  discovered a very bright outburst from this source @xcite , and was aimed at investigating the low level emission of this source and gaining insight in the physical mechanisms that drive this activity .",
    "@xcite observed 16479  between march 21 14:40:00ut and march 22 01:30:00ut .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : lcurve ] the 2 - 10  kev epic - pn light curve and spectra of the observation . in the first @xmath04",
    "ks 16479  was caught during the decay from a higher ( `` a '' ) to a lower ( `` b '' ) flux state .",
    "the shape of the above light curves and evolution of the spectrum across the state a - state b transition presented remarkable similarities with the eclipse ingress of eclipsing x - ray sources such as oao1657 - 415 @xcite . moreover the slower decay of the soft x - ray light curve ( in turn similar to that observed in oao1657 - 415 ) suggested that 16479  is seen through an extended dust - scattering halo @xcite . to confirm this we analysed the radial distribution of the x - ray photons detected from 16479  and compared it with the point spread function ( psf ) of the  telescope / epic - pn camera .",
    "we found that a 30  extended dust scattering halo located halfway between us and 16479   agrees well with the e - folding decay time of the soft x - ray light curves .",
    "motivated by the above findings we considered a spectral model that has been used in studies of eclipsing x - ray binaries seen through a dust - scattering halo , that is : @xmath6=@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9+@xmath10[@xmath11@xmath12 + @xmath13@xmath14+@xmath15@xmath16 . in practice",
    "we fitted a model with two continuum components , a single power law of slope @xmath17 ( with normalisation @xmath11 and column density @xmath18 ) and a power law of slope @xmath19 ( with normalisation @xmath8 and column density @xmath20 ) .",
    "the former component was taken to approximate the sum of two @xmath17-slope power laws : the first represents the direct component dominating before the eclipse ingress ( i.e. the component due to the accretion process onto the ns ) , whereas the second represents the wind scattered component dominating during the eclipse @xcite .",
    "the second power law component , with photon index @xmath19=@xmath17 + 2 , originates from small angle scattering of ( mainly ) direct photons off interstellar dust grains along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "the gaussians in the above equation represent iron features around @xmath06.4  kev and @xmath07.0  kev , arising from the reprocessing of the source radiation in the supergiant wind .",
    "we kept @xmath17 fixed at 0.98 , and thus @xmath19=2.98 @xcite .",
    "the best fit parameters are reported in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : lcurve ] .    in state",
    "a the relatively high source flux and small ew of the iron fluorescence line testifies that ( most of ) the emission is likely due to the direct component . in state",
    "b the ratio @xmath11/@xmath8 is larger than the corresponding value obtained during state a , whereas the ew of the fe - line at @xmath21  kev increased from @xmath0150  ev to @xmath0770  ev",
    ". we also found evidence ( @xmath02@xmath22 ) for an additional fe - line at @xmath23  kev with a @xmath0300  ev ew , consistent with being the @xmath24 .",
    "the most natural interpretation of this is that in state b the direct emission component is occulted along our line of sight , while the spectrum we observe is the sum of a dust scattered component , dominating at lower energies , and a wind scattered component characterised by a high absorption .",
    "the marked increase in the ew of the fe - line at @xmath06.5  kev across the state a - state b transition testifies that the region where the line is emitted is larger than the occulting body ( the supergiant companion , if we are dealing with an eclipse ) ; this also provides further evidence that the uneclipsed emission in state b at hard x - ray energies ( the @xmath17-slope power law ) arises mostly from photons scattered by the wind in the immediate surrounding of the source .",
    "we conclude that 16479  is the first sfxt that displayed evidence for an x - ray eclipse .",
    "further observations of 16479  and other sfxts in quiescence , will improve our knowledge of the low level emission of these sources , and will help clarifying if x - ray eclipses are common in sfxts . in fig .",
    "[ fig : simbolx ] we show the x - ray spectrum of 16479  during state b that would be observed by simbol - x .",
    "we used an exposure time of 28  ks and the latest simbol - x simulation tool available ( see http://www.apc.univ-paris7.fr/simbolx2008/ ) ."
