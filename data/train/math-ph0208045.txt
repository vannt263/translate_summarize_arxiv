    "the schrdinger - newton equations ( hereafter the sn equations ) for a quantum - mechanical particle of mass @xmath4 moving in its own gravitational potential , are the pair of coupled non - linear partial differential equations : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is planck s constant , @xmath7 is the wave function , @xmath8 is the gravitational potential , @xmath9 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath10 is time .",
    "the sn equations were introduced by penrose @xcite,@xcite in his discussion of quantum state reduction by gravity .",
    "penrose suggested that a superposition of two quantum states corresponding to two separated ` lumps ' of matter should spontaneously reduce to one or other of the states within a time related to the self - energy of the gravitational field generated by the difference of the densities .",
    "this idea requires that there be a preferred basis or special set of quantum states which collapse no further and these , penrose suggested , should in the non - relativistic limit be the stationary states of the sn equations .",
    "the spherically - symmetric stationary states of the sn equations have been found numerically by a number of authors starting with ruffini and bonazzola @xcite and including moroz , penrose and tod @xcite and bernstein , giladi and jones @xcite .",
    "our aim in this article is to test the linear stability of these solutions by linearising the time - dependent sn equations about a spherically - symmetric stationary state . in a later article",
    ", we shall present a numerical study of the full non - linear evolution in certain symmetric cases .",
    "the sn equations as introduced by penrose are closely related to the schrdinger - poisson equations which have been studied for much longer ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they are also the non - relativistic limit of the einstein equations with a complex klein - gordon field as source ( see e.g. @xcite ) which is why their solutions are sometimes known as boson stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) . + the plan of this article will be as follows . in the remainder of this section we review the nondimensionalised sn equations and collect some analytical results on them . in section 2 , we review the spherically - symmetric stationary states and in section 3 we derive the linearised time - dependent sn equations . in section 4",
    "we describe the numerical methods which will be used to solve the linearised equations and in section 5 we present the results .",
    "we shall find that the ground - state solution is linearly stable , having purely imaginary eigenvalues , and the @xmath1-th excited state , equivalently the @xmath0-th state , has @xmath1 unstable modes corresponding to @xmath1 quadruples of complex eigenvalues , together with purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "these results are in line with the expectation one might have from similar nonlinear problems like those described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ following moroz et al @xcite we begin by introducing dimensionless variables for the system ( [ sne1 ] ) .",
    "we write the rescaled @xmath11 as @xmath12 , and we rescale space and time but write them using the same variables as before to obtain the nondimensional sn equations : @xmath13 the most important rescaling , which we note for later use , is that for the time variable , for which @xmath14 with @xmath15 stationary solutions as usual take the form @xmath16 and satisfy the nondimensional time - independent sn equations : @xmath17 at this point it is worth collecting some analytical results on the sn equations .    *",
    "existence and uniqueness for solutions of ( [ ndims ] ) is established by the following simplified version of a theorem of illner et al @xcite .",

    "it is reasonable to suppose , though a proof has not appeared in the literature , that the infimum of @xmath28 is attained and that the ground state is the lowest energy spherically - symmetric solution found numerically by the authors mentioned above and proved to exist in @xcite . *",
    "the system ( [ ndims ] ) preserves the normalisation ( [ i ] ) and the quantity @xmath29 of ( [ act ] ) even with time - dependent @xmath30 and @xmath24 .",
    "we shall therefore call @xmath29 the conserved energy .",
    "note that it is different from the energy eigenvalue @xmath26 for a stationary state appearing in ( [ ntdsna ] ) . + * if we define the kinetic energy @xmath31 and potential energy @xmath32 in the obvious way by @xmath33 then @xmath34 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , in a stationary state , @xmath35 in particular , as one expects , the energy eigen - values are all negative . +",
    "* there is an interesting observation on the dispersion of the wave - function due to arriola and solar @xcite .",
    "define the second moment @xmath36 by @xmath37 assuming that the initial data is such that this integral exists , then it follows from ( [ ndims ] ) that @xmath38 now recall that , as a consequence of the maximum principle ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath24 is everywhere negative and therefore so is @xmath32 .",
    "thus if the conserved energy @xmath28 is positive , then the dispersion grows at least quadratically in time . in this sense , a positive energy solution necessarily scatters .",
    "for a spherically - symmetric stationary state , there is no loss of generality in assuming that the wave - function is real .",
    "the time - independent sn equations can therefore be written in the form @xmath39 where we have introduced the variable @xmath40 and used a subscript @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the boundary conditions are that @xmath43 as @xmath44 and @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 is a solution then so is @xmath48 for any nonzero @xmath3 .",
    "this scaling can be used to impose the normalisation ( [ i ] ) retrospectively . to solve ( [ ssne ] ) , moroz et al @xcite use a shooting method .",
    "they set @xmath49 , which can be done with a suitable @xmath3 leaving the solution not correctly normalised , then they choose values of @xmath50 and integrate away from @xmath46 .",
    "the integration continues until the solution for @xmath30 diverges at some value of @xmath41 .",
    "this value of @xmath41 can be pushed out to larger distances and the solution may diverge to large positive or large negative values . by adjusting @xmath50 it is possible to bracket a value at which @xmath30 remains finite and then @xmath26 can be identified from the limit of @xmath51 at large distances .",
    "with better triggering to recognise the diverging solutions , this technique can be refined and it becomes feasible to obtain the first 50 energy levels in a reasonable time .",
    "the first 20 eigenvalues calculated with the above routine are given in table  [ e20 ] .",
    "the first 16 agree to this order with those given by bernstein et al @xcite .",
    "[ ht ]    .",
    "the first 20 eigenvalues [ cols=\"^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     when we have the eigenvalues for a particular state , we can check the accuracy of the spectral method by solving ( [ perta ] ) with each eigenvalue in turn . using a runge - kutta method , we arrive at the same eigenfunctions as by the spectral method .",
    "+ to summarise , in this paper we have used a spectral method to analyse the linear stability of the stationary solutions of the sn equations in the context of the time - dependent sn equations .",
    "we have found that the ground - state solution is linearly stable having purely imaginary eigenvalues and the @xmath1-th excited state has @xmath1 unstable modes corresponding to @xmath1 quadruples of complex eigenvalues , together with purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
