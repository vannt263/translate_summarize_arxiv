    "it is well known@xcite that the selfconsistent mean field hamiltonian breaks the symmetries of the exact hamiltonian .",
    "the best known example is the breaking of rotational invariance by the selfconsistent mean field of deformed nuclei .",
    "rotational invariance breaking often leads to ground states of hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) type with large expectation values of the squared angular momentum operator . for heavy well deformed even - even nuclei one",
    "typically has@xcite :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the angular momentum operator component perpendicular to the symmetry axis and",
    "@xmath10 means expectation value in the hf or hfb ground state . in these instances",
    "the hf or hfb wave function can be interpreted as a wave packet from which the ground state rotational band can be obtained by angular momentum projection . as a matter of fact",
    ", the angular momentum projection can be carried out through an expansion in powers of @xmath11@xcite which , to lowest order , provides a factorization approximation formally identical to that of bohr and mottelson @xcite .    unlike rotational invariance in ordinary space , rotational invariance in isospin space",
    "is not an exact symmetry of the actual total nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "the coulomb force is non - isoscalar and thus , the actual nuclear states may have isospin mixing .",
    "isospin mixing in the ground state may allow for fermi ( f ) transitions in @xmath1 nuclei , and it is a point of present debate because of its implications on parity violation experiments on @xmath12c @xcite , as well as in the analysis of superallowed fermi transitions as a test of the unitarity of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , even with isoscalar nuclear hamiltonians , the selfconsistent mean field may break isospin invariance , and particularly so the selfconsistent quasiparticle mean field ( hf+bcs or hfb ) . therefore in studying fermi transitions and isospin mixing in the nuclear ground state , it is important to know to what extent the theoretical results respond to realistic properties of the interactions used in the calculations , or rather to spurious mean field contributions .",
    "it is important in many respects to know the value of the quantity    @xmath13    if @xmath14 is large when @xmath1 one may consider , in analogy to the case @xmath15 , that the mean field ground state is a superposition of several @xmath16eigenstates .",
    "in such a case , one may generate a corresponding isospin rotational band by isospin projection @xcite , in analogy to the above mentioned angular momentum projection method , or one may even use an isospin - cranked mean field approximation .",
    "the latter method has been discussed by wyss et al .",
    "@xcite in a somewhat different context . on the contrary",
    ", if @xmath17 is small ( @xmath18 for @xmath1 ) , it means that isospin mixing is small . in this case",
    "the mean field ground state is nearly an eigenstate of total isospin , no isospin projection may be required , and the influence of isospin mixing forces can be reliably studied .    in the shell model context",
    "@xcite large isospin mixing forces ( or matrix elements ) have been considered . in this paper",
    "we restrict our consideration to the coulomb force as treated in standard mean field calculations @xcite .",
    "we study fermi transitions and isospin properties of ground states of several nuclei , from stable to proton rich isotopes , at various levels of approximation .",
    "we first consider mean field ground states with and without pairing correlations and with and without isospin breaking interactions ( coulomb force ) .",
    "next we take into account isospin dependent residual interactions and consider qrpa - correlated ground states .",
    "the isospin restoring effect of qrpa - correlations due to isospin conserving residual interactions is discussed .",
    "other hf , tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) or rpa studies of isospin impurities in the ground states of several @xmath1 nuclei , as well as studies of the effect of such impurities on superallowed fermi and gamow - teller ( gt ) @xmath19-decay can be found in refs.@xcite and references therein .",
    "the latter works show that a simple perturbative treatment of the coulomb interaction using the same unperturbed wave functions for neutrons and protons will lead to an overestimate of isospin mixing and that the use of selfconsistent solutions is essential in calculating the values of isospin mixing probabilities .",
    "the consistency between the interaction producing the single particle spectrum and the strength of the residual particle - hole interaction is an important ingredient in our calculations .",
    "this consistency has been shown to be essential in many rpa calculations of giant resonances @xcite , as well as in double beta - decay @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec . ii we present results on fermi strength distributions . in sec .",
    "iii we compare @xmath17 values to @xmath20 values in the mean field approach and we discuss @xmath17 values in different approaches . in sec .",

    "in previous publications we studied @xmath21-decay strength functions @xcite of several isotopic chains in the @xmath22 region , within the mean field context and beyond .",
    "we performed qrpa calculations on top of a quasiparticle basis obtained from a selfconsistent deformed hartree - fock approach with density - dependent skyrme forces . in this work",
    "we use the skyrme force sg2 @xcite as a representative of these forces .",
    "we use gamow - teller and fermi residual interactions consistent with the mean field single particle basis , both being derived from the same two - body skyrme interactions . in those works attention was focused on gamow - teller strength distributions which are dominant ( see fig .  1 ) . at variance with standard shell - model calculations @xcite , in our selfconsistent mean field based calculations @xcite ,",
    "isospin is not an exact quantum number , and one may wonder how large can be the effect of isospin breaking .",
    "we investigate this question here focusing on fermi transitions where isospin breaking effects can be expected to be of most importance .",
    "the fermi strength distribution can be written as    @xmath23    with    @xmath24    where @xmath25 are the rising and lowering isospin operators , @xmath26 represents the ground state and @xmath27 are the proton - neutron ( pn ) excited states .",

    "we use the convention @xmath57    in the qrpa method @xmath27 represents a pn - qrpa phonon state and @xmath26 the qrpa correlated ground state .",

    "the calculations of these amplitudes have been done as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "we use separable residual interactions as those derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "we note that the residual fermi interaction @xmath67 ( as well as the gt @xmath68 ) is an isospin restoring force and largely eliminates the spurious contributions due to isospin breaking that may be present in mean field calculations .    in fig .  1 we compare fermi strengths to gt strengths taking as an example @xmath69kr .",
    "the fermi strength given by eq .",
    "( [ bf ] ) , as well as the corresponding expression for the gamow - teller strength , have been transformed into continuous curves by a folding procedure using @xmath70 mev width gaussians .",
    "the strength distributions are plotted versus the excitation energy of the daughter nucleus .",
    "the dominance of gamow - teller strengths over fermi strengths is apparent for both @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "one clearly sees that the already small mean field fermi strengths get further reduced in rpa .",
    "the general reduction of the strengths in qrpa can be traced back to the isospin restoring role of the residual interactions , being maximal for the @xmath6 fermi strength which is strongly reduced .",
    "the results shown in this figure are obtained taking into account the coulomb interaction in the mean field .    in the next figures ( fig .  2 to fig .",
    "5 ) we show the role of coulomb interaction , as well as that of pairing and rpa correlation effects , on fermi strengths calculated for the kr isotopic chain for @xmath71=70 to @xmath71=74 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the fermi strengths obtained in the limit of small pairing ( @xmath72 mev ) and no coulomb force . starting with @xmath73kr on the left , we observe that the @xmath6strength ( plotted in the upper panels ) rapidly decreases with increasing a while the @xmath4 strength ( plotted in the bottom panels ) , rapidly increases with @xmath71 .",
    "we also observe that the reduction of the strength in going from mean field ( mf ) to qrpa is much stronger in the isospin - forbidden cases .    to clarify what we mean by isospin - forbidden cases let us recall that if the ground state @xmath26 is the exact ground state of the system , in the absence of coulomb force , it is an eigenstate of the isospin operator with eigenvalues @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "hence , it is clear that in this case    @xmath76    @xmath77    so that in eqs.([bf],[bfx ] ) there is a single @xmath27 state @xmath78 ( with @xmath79 ) which is accessible by the @xmath80 ( if @xmath81 ) or the @xmath82 ( if @xmath83 ) operators .",
    "accordingly , we call isospin - forbidden transitions to the @xmath6 transitions in kr isotopes with @xmath84 and to the @xmath4 transitions with @xmath85 .",
    "the fact that all isospin - forbidden transitions in fig .",
    "2 are small indicates that isospin breaking is small in the mean field approximation and gets further reduced in qrpa .    as we include",
    "the coulomb interaction , @xmath86 is no longer an exact quantum number , and isospin breaking ( although very small ) becomes an actual property of the system . in the presence of the coulomb interaction eqs.([t+],[t- ] ) are no longer strictly valid , allowing for @xmath87 transitions in the isospin - forbidden cases .",
    "when we compare the results in fig .  3 , which we obtained including the coulomb force , with the corresponding ones in fig .",
    "2 we observe an increase of the @xmath6 @xmath88kr , @xmath69kr strengths , as well as of the @xmath4 @xmath73kr , @xmath88kr strengths .",
    "this small increase of the isospin - forbidden transitions of fig .",
    "2 is solely due to the effect of the coulomb force on fermi transition and it is a signature of the corresponding small isospin breaking .",
    "one may also observe that in the absence of coulomb force ( fig .",
    "2 ) the @xmath89 and @xmath4 strength distributions are identical in @xmath88kr , but the two distributions become somewhat different when the coulomb force is taken into account ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    finally in fig .",
    "4 we show the @xmath6 and @xmath4 strengths for the same nuclei obtained with realistic pairing gaps ( @xmath90 mev , see table 2 ) . for the allowed transitions ( @xmath6 in @xmath73kr , @xmath4 in @xmath69kr )",
    "one can see by comparison with fig .  2 that the main effect of pairing is to open up more transition channels and to moderately reduce the strengths of the dominant peaks .",
    "more dramatic is the effect of pairing on the isospin - forbidden transitions which grow up by orders of magnitude in all cases , even though they remain considerably smaller than the allowed ones .",
    "this growth of the isospin - forbidden strengths is mainly connected to the stronger isospin breaking of the quasiparticle mean field with increasing pairing gaps .",
    "it is present irrespective of whether coulomb interaction is included or not in the calculation ( see also fig .  5 ) .",
    "one also sees that the qrpa results strongly reduce the strengths of the isospin - forbidden @xmath87 transitions as compared to their mean field values .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction the amount of angular momentum mixing in the mean field ground state of axially symmetric deformed nuclei is measured by the expectation value of the squared angular momentum operator perpendicular to the symmetry axis z.    @xmath91    similarly , taking the z axis in isospin space in the standard way ( @xmath92 , or @xmath74 ) , we can measure the amount of isospin mixing by the expectation value of @xmath93 , or    @xmath94    using the definition of fermi transition amplitudes in eqs.([f-],[f+ ] ) one immediately gets the identity    @xmath95    with    @xmath96    in tables 1 and 2 we compare @xmath97 values to @xmath98 values .",

    "table 2 contains the results obtained taking into account bcs pairing correlations with realistic values of the pairing gaps ( listed in the tables ) .    to see the amount of isospin mixing introduced by the coulomb force we give @xmath97 values obtained with and without coulomb force .    as seen in the tables , the values of @xmath101",
    "are large for the deformed isotopes .",
    "they decrease with decreasing deformation and become 0 ( @xmath102 for spherical isotopes ( @xmath103kr , @xmath104kr ) .    comparing the @xmath98 values in tables 1 and 2 ,",
    "one can see that @xmath98 decreases with pairing . in the no pairing limit for the prolate shape of @xmath69kr , where the deformation value reaches the value @xmath105 , one gets @xmath106 pairing correlations with realistic gap values",
    "reduce this large @xmath107 value by one third .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath97 values which are increased when pairing correlations are included .",
    "the large @xmath98 values for the well deformed shapes are in contrast with the small values of @xmath108 , with which they are to be compared .",
    "the @xmath109 values , given in the tables along with @xmath97 values , are defined as    @xmath110    to clarify the meaning of this magnitude , we recall that in the limit in which the ground state is an isospin eigenstate , with @xmath111 , we have that    @xmath112 = \\left| t_z\\right| = \\left| \\frac{n - z}{2}\\right| \\ , .\\ ] ]    therefore @xmath109 gives a better measure of the isospin mixing than @xmath97 in isotopes with @xmath113 .",
    "we see in table 1 that without pairing and coulomb @xmath114 in @xmath1 isotopes , i.e. , there is no isospin mixing in hf approach when isospin conserving two - body force is used .",
    "the amount of isospin mixing introduced by the inclusion of the coulomb force in the hartree - fock approximation can be seen comparing the @xmath109 values with and without coulomb in table 1 . for the @xmath2 isotopes in the hf",
    "approach the amount of isospin mixing as measured by @xmath109 is on the order of a few percent with no coulomb and gets somewhat increased when coulomb force is included .",
    "it is interesting to see that the @xmath109 value tends to decrease with increasing @xmath115 value .",
    "this is in agreement with spectroscopic observations and confirms the idea that the larger is the value of @xmath116 the better is the isospin quantum number .",
    "as already mentioned , pairing correlations increase the isospin mixing , which as seen in table 2 reaches a maximum in the @xmath1 @xmath88kr isotope where @xmath117 .",
    "yet if we compare this latter value with the @xmath101 value ( @xmath118 for the same nucleus , we see that one can not really talk of an isospin rotational band .",
    "indeed if we write the hf+bcs state @xmath119  of @xmath88kr as a linear combination of isospin eigenstates @xmath120 @xmath121 one sees that the mixing of @xmath122 components is quite small .",
    "indeed , @xmath123 means that    @xmath124    where one sees that @xmath125 and @xmath126 .    a corresponding expansion of @xmath119 in orthonormalized angular momentum eigenfunctions    @xmath127    gives    @xmath128    which provides no constraint on the amount of @xmath129 angular momentum components .",
    "this exercise shows that while angular momentum projection can be used to build up a rotational band , isospin projection can hardly be used to construct an isospin rotational band out of @xmath130 .",
    "let us now consider what happens when we calculate the expectation values of @xmath131 in the pn - qrpa correlated ground state . the results obtained when we take into account qrpa correlations induced by fermi residual interactions of the form @xmath132 can be seen in tables 3 and 4 . in these tables we give the values obtained for the total strengths @xmath133 and @xmath134 together with @xmath109 with and without coulomb interaction .    in the qrpa approximation",
    "the total strengths for @xmath6 and @xmath4 fermi transitions are given by eq.([sf+- ] ) , where the sum over @xmath135 runs over all the pn - qrpa solutions and the @xmath87 amplitudes @xmath136 are given by eq.([frpa ] ) .",

    "these equations explicitly show that , as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the total @xmath139 strength splits into a one - body term that counts the total number of protons ( neutrons ) , and a two - body term that depends on the two - body correlations included in the descriptions of the nuclear ground state .",
    "the two - body term is identical in @xmath140 and @xmath141 summed strengths , and as a result one gets the ikeda sum rule    @xmath142    which is always satisfied in our calculations .",

    "contains the pure pairing correlation and it reaches its minimum value in the limit of no pairing and no coulomb force . indeed in the hf limit",
    "one has that    @xmath145    if , in addition , there is no coulomb force    @xmath146    and we have that    @xmath147    we therefore find that in the limit of no pairing and no coulomb force :    @xmath148    as we found numerically in table 1 . in the general case we can write    @xmath149    with @xmath150 the qrpa correlation term defined in eq.([crpa ] ) and @xmath151 the bcs correlation term defined as    @xmath152    owing to eq.([t22 ] ) we see that the value of @xmath109 , as defined in eq.([t20 ] ) , is purely due to the correlation terms in eqs.([crpa]-[c_bcs ] ) ,    @xmath153    and that for @xmath1 and no coulomb force    @xmath154    the results in tables 1 and 2 show that the bcs correlations increase always the @xmath97 value from its limiting hartree - fock value . on the other hand if we compare the results of tables 1 and 2 to the results of tables 3 and 4 , which include both correlation terms ( see eq.([tfin ] ) ) , we see that the increase of @xmath108 due to the bcs correlations is largely reduced by the qrpa correlations , which tend to restore isospin invariance .",
