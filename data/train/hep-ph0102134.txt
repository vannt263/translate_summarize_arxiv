    "this work deals with the computation of the transverse momentum distribution in heavy flavour photoproduction . at present , fixed order ( fo ) calculations are available , including nlo ( next - to - leading - order ) corrections  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for very large transverse momenta , the so - called fragmentation function ( or resummed ) formalism , that allows to resum enhanced terms of order @xmath4 ( which we call leading - logarithmic terms , or ll ) , plus terms of order @xmath5 ( next - to - leading logarithmic terms , or nll ) has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , building upon ref .",
    "this approach has however the drawback that it is essentially a `` massless '' formalism , in the sense that it does not include contributions to the cross section that are suppressed by powers of @xmath6 .",
    "several h1  @xcite and zeus  @xcite results are presented in comparison either with calculations performed in the resummed ( massless ) approach ( rs ) , or with the fixed - order nlo calculation .",
    "it is thus important to provide a framework for computing a heavy - flavour cross section which is accurate in both the large and the small transverse momentum regions .",
    "a method for performing the merging of the fo  @xcite and rs  @xcite calculations in the hadroproduction case was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the hadroproduction context",
    "it was found that the mass corrections are positive and large , a result somewhat contrary to the intuitive belief that masses reduce the phase space , and thus the cross sections .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to the photoproduction case .",
    "this extension is not a straightforward one .",
    "in fact , it is well known that a generic photoproduction cross section has to be written as the sum of two components ( _ pointlike _ and _ hadronic _ , also called _ direct _ and _ resolved _ respectively ) . for the transverse momentum spectrum of a heavy quark",
    "we write = .|_pnt + .|_hdr , [ phplushd ] where pnt stands for pointlike and hdr for hadronic ; @xmath7 is the rapidity of the heavy quark in the laboratory frame , and .|_pnt&=&_jdx_p f^(h)_j(x_p ) ( p_,x_pp_h ) , [ phxsec ] + .|_hdr&= & _ ijdx_dx_p",
    "f^()_i(x_)f^(h)_j(x_p ) ( x _ p_,x_p",
    "p_h ) . [ hdxsec ]",
    "the sums run over parton flavours , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the four - momenta of the incoming photon and hadron respectively , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 are the subtracted partonic cross sections . the pointlike and hadronic components of eqs .",
    "( [ phxsec ] ) and  ( [ hdxsec ] ) are strictly related beyond the leading order in perturbation theory : none of them is a physical quantity , only their sum ( eq .  ( [ phplushd ] ) ) is measurable .",
    "this is the origin of the most serious problem we face when extending the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to the present case . in this work",
    "we shall follow the strategy adopted in that paper , but we shall point out the major differences with respect to it , due to the problems inherent to eq .",
    "( [ phplushd ] ) .    in perturbation theory at next - to - leading order ( i.e. , the highest accuracy reached so far in the computation of heavy flavour cross sections ) , we have the expansions d_j&=&_emd_j^(0)+ _",
    "em^2 d_j^(1 ) , [ phexp ] + d_ij&=&^2 d_ij^(0)+ ^3 d_ij^(1 ) .",
    "[ hdexp ] however , the parton densities in the photon @xmath12 behave asymptotically ( i.e. , at large scales ) as @xmath13 .",
    "thus , at least at the formal level , the perturbative expansions of the pointlike and hadronic components of eqs .",
    "( [ phxsec ] ) and  ( [ hdxsec ] ) are both series in @xmath14 , as in eq .",
    "( [ phexp ] ) .",
    "this allows us to simplify substantially our presentation ; in what follows , we shall write the physical cross section of eq .",
    "( [ phplushd ] ) as an expansion in @xmath14 .",
    "the reader must keep in mind that , in doing this , we are not referring to the pointlike component only , but to the observable that is actually measured in experiments .",
    "when we shall deal either with the pointlike or with the hadronic component only , we shall indicate it explicitly .",
    "having clarified this point , we proceed in our program of extending the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to photoproduction reactions .",
    "this means that we shall implement a computation with the following features :    * all terms of order @xmath15 and @xmath0 are included exactly , including mass effects ; * all terms of order @xmath16 and @xmath17 are included , with the possible exception of terms that are suppressed by powers of @xmath6 .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us write schematically the result of the nlo calculation of the photoproduction cross section as @xmath18 the explicit dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 upon @xmath21 ( the centre - of - mass energy ) , @xmath7 , @xmath22 and the factorization / renormalization scale @xmath23 is not indicated , and @xmath24 .",
    "the nll resummed cross section is given by @xmath25 where pst stands for terms suppressed by powers of @xmath6 in the large-@xmath22 limit ( possibly with further powers of mass logarithms ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend upon @xmath21 , @xmath7 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath28 , they do not contain large logarithms of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "the only large logarithms are the ones explicitly indicated .",
    "our approach combines the results of eqs .",
    "( [ nlosch ] ) and ( [ nllsch ] ) , giving @xmath30 where the function @xmath31 is quite arbitrary , except that it must be a smooth function ( also in the @xmath32 limit ) , and that it must approach one when @xmath33 , up to terms suppressed by powers of @xmath6 .",
    "observe that the sums now start from @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , in order to avoid double counting .",
    "thus , this formalism contains all the information coming from the fixed - order nlo calculation _ and _ from the nll resummed calculation .",
    "the arbitrariness in the function @xmath36 arises from the fact that we do not know the structure of power - suppressed terms in the higher orders of the nll resummed calculation .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath36 only affects terms of order @xmath37 , so far unknown .    before turning to the practical implementation of eq .",
    "( [ fonllsch ] ) , we stress that it is important that both the rs and the fo approaches are expressed in the same renormalization scheme .",
    "the commonly used fo approach uses a renormalization and factorization scheme in which the heavy flavour is treated as heavy .",
    "thus , if we are dealing with charm , we use @xmath38 of 3 light flavours as our running coupling constant , and the appropriate structure functions should not include the charm quark in the evolution .",
    "the rs approach , on the other hand , also includes the heavy flavour as an active , light degree of freedom .",
    "this problem can be easily overcome by a simple change of scheme in the fo calculation .",
    "section  [ sec : scheme ] contains the details of this procedure .",
    "once this is done , the fo calculation matches exactly the terms up to order @xmath0 in the resummed approach , in the limit where power - suppressed mass terms are negligible . in order to subtract from the rs",
    "result the terms already present in the fo , we must provide an approximation to the latter where terms suppressed by powers of the mass are dropped .",
    "we shall call fom0 this `` massless limit '' . in the simplified notation of eqs .",
    "( [ nlosch ] ) and ( [ nllsch ] ) we have @xmath39 and the fom0 approximation is given by @xmath40 our final result will be given by @xmath41 the notation fonll stands for fixed - order plus next - to - leading logs . formula ( [ eq : merge ] ) is our practical implementation of eq .",
    "( [ fonllsch ] ) .",
    "the quantities appearing in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : merge ] ) are available as fortran computer codes . actually , due to the non - physical splitting of photoproduction cross sections as given in eq .",
    "( [ phplushd ] ) , the pointlike and hadronic components are usually computed by different packages .",
    "it is therefore useful to write fo = fo_pnt+fo_hdr , fom0=fom0_pnt+fom0_hdr , rs = rs_pnt+rs_hdr .",
    "the package that computes @xmath42 was originally developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently modified in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to implement @xmath43 ( whose analytical form was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and in order to use the appropriate renormalization and factorization scheme .",
    "@xmath44 was computed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and @xmath45 was obtained in the present work .",
    "the code for @xmath44 ( taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ) has been extensively modified in the context of the present work in a manner analogous to what done for @xmath42 in ref .",
    "the package that computes @xmath46 was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , suitably modified for heavy quark fragmentation in ref .",
    "@xcite , and used in ref .",
    "finally , the package relevant to @xmath47 was written by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , and adapted to heavy quark fragmentation in ref .",
    "it has undergone some further modifications during the course of this work .",
    "it should be clear that fo , fom0 , and rs are all strictly interrelated .",
    "this fact provides us with a way not only to test that the various codes mentioned above are mutually consistent , but also that their implementation in our formalism , eq .",
    "( [ fonllsch ] ) , has been carried out correctly .",
    "in particular , the relation between fo and fom0 , and between fom0 and rs , will be the argument of sections  [ sec : fom0 ] and  [ sec : matching ] respectively .",
    "in the latter section , we shall show in particular that the fom0 and rs results differ only by terms of order @xmath37 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : scheme ] we describe the procedure to adopt in order to translate the fo result from a scheme with @xmath48 light flavours to a scheme with @xmath49 light flavours . in sect .",
    "[ sec : fom0 ] we give a few details concerning the calculation of the massless limit of the fo calculation . in sect .",
    "[ sec : matching ] we check the matching between the fom0 and the rs calculation . unlike in the hadroproduction case , subtleties arise here due to a different separation of the hadronic and pointlike contributions in the fo and rs approaches .",
    "we shall see that only in the full ( i.e. pointlike plus hadronic ) cross section we have complete matching . in sect .",
    "[ sec : powereff ] we examine the size of power - suppressed effects in order to understand at which value of @xmath6 the massless approach gives a sensible approximation to the massive calculation .",
    "the function @xmath31 will be chosen on the basis of the considerations given in this section . in sect .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] we describe our full result , for the case of charm production at hera . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we give our conclusions .",
    "as shown in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , a change of scheme from the one with @xmath50 to the one with @xmath51 light flavours brings about the following changes in @xmath38 and in the parton densities @xmath52+{\\cal o}(\\as^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all other parton densities are affected at higher orders in @xmath38 . eqs .",
    "( [ aschangescheme ] ) and  ( [ fgchangescheme ] ) are universal , that is , process - independent .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that the pointlike and hadronic components of the cross sections transform independently under this change of scheme .",
    "thus , for what concerns the latter component , we can safely use the formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the pointlike component , the only effect at @xmath53",
    "is generated by the born - level @xmath54 cross section .",
    "it is a matter of trivial algebra to conclude that , in order to go from the @xmath50-flavour to the @xmath49-flavour scheme , the fixed - order cross section has to be modified by adding a term @xmath55 to the @xmath54 cross section . for any reasonable range of scales , this correction is not large , and it vanishes for @xmath56 .    in the following",
    ", we shall always refer to the fo and fom0 calculations performed in the @xmath49-flavour scheme .",
    "we shall thus always assume that @xmath38 and the parton densities @xmath57 refer to @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "as in the case of the change of scheme , the massless limit of fo can clearly be performed independently for the pointlike and hadronic components .",
    "the latter has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here , we only deal with the pointlike part .    the massless limit of the fixed - order pointlike cross section formulae ( in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ fom0sch ] ) ) is obtained via algebraic methods from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the limiting procedure is non - trivial .",
    "in fact , the partonic cross sections at order @xmath0 contain distributions , such as delta functions or principal value singularities .",
    "when taking the massless limit , new contributions to these distributions arise .",
    "we have computed this limit analytically by a computer - algebra procedure applied to the massive cross section formula , and checked its correctness in the following way .",
    "we compute the heavy - flavour differential cross section at fixed @xmath22 , @xmath7 , and centre - of - mass energy .",
    "we choose the renormalization and factorization scales equal to @xmath22 . under these conditions , the mass dependence of the result",
    "is confined to the partonic cross sections . in the massless limit approximation ,",
    "the only remnants of mass dependence are in logarithms of the mass in the @xmath53 terms .",
    "thus , if we plot the @xmath45 cross section versus the logarithm of the mass , we get a straight line . on the other hand ,",
    "if we plot the full @xmath44 cross section versus the logarithm of the mass , it should approach the @xmath45 result in the limit of small masses .",
    "we have performed this test , choosing the proton energy @xmath60gev and the photon energy @xmath61gev .",
    "we adopt the cteq4 m set @xcite for the proton parton density functions .",
    "these parameters will be our reference choice from now on .",
    "the results are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : lim_all ] and [ fig : lim_pgpq ] .    from the figures , it is quite apparent that the massless limit , as well as its implementation for the calculation of cross sections , was carried out correctly .",
    "there is also an important observation to make : the @xmath45 cross section is _ larger _ than the massive calculation , i.e. power suppressed mass effects are negative , contrary to the case of hadroproduction .",
    "notice also that the @xmath45 approximation is quite accurate even at relatively large values of @xmath6 .",
    "for example , from both figs .",
    "[ fig : lim_all ] and  [ fig : lim_pgpq ] we notice that even for @xmath62 , the @xmath44 cross section differs from @xmath45 by at most 30% .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the case of the hadronic component ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath43 is describing well @xmath42 only for rather small values of @xmath6 . this mismatch between the behaviour of the pointlike and the hadronic component will clearly show up in phenomenologically relevant cases , as we shall later see in sect .",
    "[ sec : pheno ] .",
    "we now examine the matching between the resummed approach and the fom0 calculation . in this case , there is a strict interplay between the pointlike and the hadronic components , that should be dealt with very carefully .",
    "there are ingredients in the resummed approach that are not explicitly present in the fom0 calculation .",
    "these are the fragmentation functions for final - state partons to go into the heavy quark , and the parton density for finding a heavy quark inside the hadron .",
    "the fragmentation function for any parton to go into a heavy quark has a power expansion in terms of the coupling constant evaluated at the scale @xmath23 , and denote the common value with @xmath23 . ] , and of logarithms of @xmath63 : @xmath64 that can be obtained by solving the evolution equation for the fragmentation function at the nll level , with the initial conditions of ref .",
    "similarly , the parton density for finding the heavy flavour in a hadron can be expanded in the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 in the argument of the coefficients , we mean that the coefficients have a complicated _ functional _ dependence upon the parton densities evaluated at the scale @xmath23 .",
    "the existence of formal expansions of the form  ( [ eq : dseries ] ) and ( [ eq : fseries ] ) can be easily proved , by writing the altarelli ",
    "parisi equations in integral form , and then solving them iteratively . a more detailed argument was given in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dseries ] ) and ( [ eq : fseries ] ) are formally substituted in the rs cross section formula , this formula itself becomes a power expansion of the form of eq .",
    "( [ nllsch ] ) , with the coefficients that depend ( functionally ) upon the structure functions for light partons , in the @xmath49-flavours scheme , evaluated at the scale @xmath23 .",
    "the fom0 calculation has an expansion of the same form ( truncated to order @xmath0 ) with coefficients that are also dependent upon the same light - parton structure functions . if we had used the standard scheme for the fixed - order calculation , the structure functions and the coupling @xmath38 appearing there would be those with @xmath67 flavours . ]",
    "evaluated at the scale @xmath23 .",
    "thus , because of the next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy of the resummed cross section , the terms up to the order @xmath0 in @xmath68 will match exactly with the fom0 calculation .    in the photoproduction case",
    ", the matching can take place only in the full cross section , i.e. pointlike plus hadronic .",
    "in fact , let us consider the photoproduction subprocess in which a photon splits into a heavy - quark pair , and afterwards the heavy quark scatters with a parton coming from the hadron , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon - split ] .    the contributions depicted in the figure , in the kinematic region of a photon splitting collinearly , is fully included in the pointlike contribution in the massive , fixed order calculation .",
    "in fact , because of the mass , no collinear subtractions are needed on the photon side .    in the resummed approach , instead",
    ", these graphs are collinear divergent , and the singularities are subtracted at a scale @xmath23 .",
    "a corresponding hadronic contribution is present , where a heavy quark is found inside the incoming photon .",
    "such a contribution is not present in the hadronic part of the fixed - order approach .",
    "therefore , in order to check the matching , we should consider pointlike plus hadronic cross sections , and compute the difference between two relatively large numbers ( rs and fom0 ) , each of which is obtained as the sum of two numbers ( @xmath47 plus @xmath46 and @xmath45 plus @xmath43 ) . in practice",
    ", this procedure requires an extremely careful treatment of numerics , which is not required anywhere else in our study .",
    "we thus adopted a slightly different , although equivalent , strategy , which is based upon the observation that , as far as the matching is concerned , it is only the contribution depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon - split ] that is treated differently in rs and fom0 .",
    "therefore , we can simply add to the resummed pointlike result the hadronic contribution with a heavy quark in a photon .",
    "since the matching is checked up to the order @xmath0 , it is enough to compute such contribution at this order .",
    "calling @xmath69 the @xmath69-channel invariant of the photon - hadron system and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) the heavy quark ( light recoiling parton ) rapidity in the photon - hadron cm system , we immediately find @xmath72 where pq stands for photon to quark , and @xmath73 @xmath74 is the leading order ( i.e. @xmath75 ) massless cross section ( without the two - body phase space ) for the partons @xmath76 ( the heavy quark ) and @xmath77 ( a light quark or a gluon ) to give an outgoing heavy quark @xmath76 with transverse momentum @xmath22 and rapidity @xmath78 in the parton centre - of mass ( cm ) .",
    "the variables @xmath22 and @xmath78 characterize completely the scattering kinematics in the partonic cm system . we have furthermore @xmath79 and the partonic cross sections are @xmath80 where the partonic mandelstam variables",

    "( [ photonsplit ] ) .",
    "such contribution is part of the direct component of the fom0 result .    in order to check the matching of the resummed and fixed order calculation we proceeded in the following way :    * we computed the @xmath45 result in the @xmath49 flavours scheme ; * we computed the rs result without the intrinsic heavy quark component in the hadron parton densities , and with a heavy quark fragmentation function set equal to @xmath84 for the @xmath85 component , and all other components set to zero ; * we computed the lo contribution to the rs result , with the heavy quark component in the hadron parton densities set equal to @xmath86 and all other components set to zero ; * we computed the lo contribution to the rs result , with the heavy quark density set to zero , and the heavy quark fragmentation function set to its @xmath87 value @xmath88_+ \\label{dqq } \\\\",

    "this follows easily from the work of ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "this is in fact what we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : pntmatching ] .",
    "we also see that , as previously discussed , @xmath45 is not a good approximation of @xmath47 , due to the lack of the photon - splitting term @xmath89 .",
    "we further note that the matching deteriorates at higher values of @xmath22 , due to the increasing importance of the resummation performed in @xmath47 but absent in @xmath45 .",

    "these are equal for the fom0 and rs calculations , but differ in the fo case . in ref .",

    "it is clear that , in the plots at fixed transverse momentum , the massive calculation is more suppressed near the threshold ( i.e. , as @xmath95 approaches @xmath22 ) . in this region",
    "higher @xmath96 values are probed in the proton structure function with respect to the massless calculation since , besides the transverse momentum , also the mass has to be produced .",
    "this is clearly a spurious effect , and we shall always prefer to perform the matching at fixed transverse masses . the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : pe_plots ] is an _ a posteriori _ justification of this procedure , since it is quite clear that in this case the massive and massless limit results are much closer to each other .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the right plot of fig .",

    "this rapidity value is quite close to the phase space boundary , where we do in fact expect some anomalous behaviour due to sudakov logarithms .",

    "this is due to the fact that the parton densities are often given as an interpolating grid , and the region near the heavy flavour threshold may not be represented accurately .",
    "furthermore some parton density sets do not implement the heavy flavour thresholds according to ref .",
    "while for hadron structure functions several sets with a correct charm density are available , the choice among photon structure functions is quite limited . we have chosen the afg set  @xcite , which is in the @xmath107 scheme , and claims a correct implementation of the charm density",

    "we have checked , however , that these differences would only be marginally important if our approximate formula , eq .",
    "( [ cpdfapprox ] ) , were used to calculate physical cross sections , the results obtained with the original afg charm densities being well reproduced .    in what follows , we consider our reference case of photon - proton collisions , with @xmath61gev and @xmath112gev . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : x1min ] we plot contour lines representing the minimum value of @xmath113 allowed in the hadronic component of the cross section , in the @xmath7-@xmath22 plane .",
    "commonly available photon structure function fits are undefined below values of @xmath113 of the order of @xmath114 . the minimum value of @xmath115 relevant to the afg set is explicitly shown in the figure .",
    "for rapidities currently probed at hera , smaller @xmath113 values are never reached . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : x1min ] we show , for future reference , the ratio @xmath116 of the pointlike component over the total cross section , both computed at the nlo . where the hadronic component prevails ( i.e. @xmath116 becomes small ) , we expect to find the same problems found in ref .",
    "@xcite as far as the matching between rs and fom0 is concerned .",
    "we point out that the results displayed in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : x1min ] have a scale dependence of @xmath53 , and they are thus accurate to lo only ; however , the plot gives a clear idea on the dominance of pointlike or hadronic components in the physical cross sections .    in our phenomenological study",
    "we shall use @xmath117gev , the afg set for the photon and cteq4 m for the proton parton densities . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rap - pt2-nosuda ] we show the rapidity distribution for charm quarks at @xmath118gev .    in the left plot of this figure , both the fixed order prediction and our fonll results",
    "are shown .",
    "the photon has negative rapidity in our convention .",
    "the phase space limit for the rapidity at @xmath118gev is @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the left limit of the plots is near the negative rapidity limit .",
    "no suppression factor was applied to the difference @xmath120 . at these low values of @xmath22",
    ", we would expect that the fixed order and the fonll result should agree .",
    "in fact we observe good agreement at negative rapidity , while at moderate and large rapidity the fonll result is much larger than the fixed order one .    a detailed analysis of the various contributions to the fonll cross section",
    "is shown in the right plot of the figure .",
    "we show the rs result , and the mass corrections fo - fom0 , for the pointlike and hadronic component separately . for comparison , also the fixed order pointlike and hadronic component",
    "are shown .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "we begin by noticing that the difference @xmath121 ( the dashed line in the left lower corner of the plot ) is quite small compared to @xmath44 . on the contrary",
    ", @xmath122 is even larger than the @xmath42 result , due to a negative @xmath43 contribution . comparing the pointlike and hadronic fixed order results",
    ", we see that the first one prevails up to rapidities of 0.4 . a similar plot , for @xmath123gev ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rap - pt3-nosuda ] .",
    "we see similar features to the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : rap - pt2-nosuda ] .",
    "we conclude that the large difference between our fonll and fo results is only due to the hadronic component of the cross section .",
    "this is consistent with what already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that paper",
    "these differences were ascribed to a large @xmath120 term which , due to spurious higher order terms present in rs , did not vanish quickly enough in the small @xmath22 limit .",
    "consequently , the small-@xmath22 suppression factor @xmath124 , with @xmath103 , was applied to the difference @xmath120 in order to get rid of this problem .    in this work",
    "we can now make a conjecture about a possible relation between the higher order behaviour of the `` massless '' rs calculation and the size of the mass terms : in the hadronic case mass terms are large and so are the higher orders in rs . in the pointlike component , instead , the mass terms are relatively small , and there appears to be a good cancellation between rs and fom0 .",
    "one can therefore make the reasonable assumption that the less important the power suppressed mass terms are , the better behaved a resummed `` massless '' approximation will be .",
    "having said so , we observe that for the pointlike component alone no suppression factor is actually needed , consistently with what we observed in section  [ sec : matching ] .    at this point , one",
    "is tempted to apply the suppression factor @xmath31 only to the difference @xmath125 . however",
    ", this would be incorrect . as we have already discussed in section [ sec : matching ] , the terms of order @xmath15 and @xmath0 in @xmath46 do not match @xmath43 .",
    "the difference @xmath125 is of order @xmath0 .",
    "thus , using a different @xmath104 value for the pointlike and hadronic component would lead to the introduction of mass suppressed terms of order @xmath0 , that would spoil the accuracy of our calculation .",
    "it is instead sensible to use different @xmath104 values in the following expression @xmath126 since now the expressions in parentheses are indeed of the appropriate order . from formula ( [ fonllocdcr ] ) with @xmath127 we recover the standard expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : merge2 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcr ] we show the effect of varying independently @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the fonll result of eq .",
    "( [ fonllocdcr ] ) .",
    "it is quite clear that the inclusion of a smearing function for the pointlike component has little effect ( the difference between the two solid lines ) .",
    "the smearing function for the hadronic component has instead a very large effect , suppressing the cross section at small @xmath22 . in its absence ( dashed curve ) , one gets a cross section that is roughly twice as large as the fixed order one . at large @xmath22 the sensitivity to a smearing function decreases rapidly .",
    "the fonll approach gives smaller cross sections than the fixed order approach in this region .",
    "this is what one expects from resummation effects , since the emission of collinear gluons , in general , has the effect of softening the @xmath22 spectrum .",
    "similar plots are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcrym1 ] for @xmath130 .    also here we see that the effect of the smearing function on the pointlike component of the cross section is small , and we see a relatively large effect of the smearing in the hadronic component .",
    "this effect is not quite as large as in the case of @xmath131 , because at negative rapidity the hadronic component is less important .",
    "we shall now show a few benchmark results for photoproduction of heavy flavour at hera . for simplicity , we shall always keep @xmath132 .",
    "the aim of these results is to assess the difference between the fixed order results , the resummed results , and our matched formalism .",
    "we assume an incident photon energy of 16.5  gev ( corresponding to an electron energy of 27.5 gev and to a photon energy fraction of 0.6 ) , and a proton energy of 820 gev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalp6y0 ]    we show a comparison between the fonll , fo and rs results .",
    "we see that the rs and fo results are remarkably close for small @xmath22 , a fact that we have understood to be true for the pointlike component , and purely accidental for the hadronic component . at moderate @xmath22",
    "also the fonll result is very close to the fo result .",
    "while in the case of the pointlike component this is true in all cases , for the hadronic component this only happens if one chooses a relatively large value for @xmath104 . at very small",
    "@xmath22 the resummed calculation becomes totally unreliable . at large @xmath22 , the fonll and",
    "rs results become quite similar ( since , by construction , the @xmath31 suppression factor tends to one , and fo tends to fom0 , canceling it - see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : merge ] ) and ( [ eq : merge2 ] ) ) , and remain smaller than the fo result .",
    "this is a general consequence of the effect of multi - gluon emission resummed in the rs and fonll approaches .",
    "the pattern displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalp6y0 ] seems to be quite universal .",
    "similar plots for @xmath133 and @xmath130 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalp6ypm1 ] .",
    "furthermore in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalp2p4 ] we also show the case of photon energy fractions of 0.4 and 0.2 ( that is @xmath134 and @xmath135 gev respectively ) .",
    "in this work we have implemented a technique to compute the transverse momentum spectrum in heavy flavour photoproduction , which is accurate to the full nlo level at moderate @xmath22 values , and to the nll level at large @xmath22 .",
    "we observe that , for the pointlike component of the cross section ( in the sense discussed in section  [ sec : matching ] ) , the massless limit is a good approximation to the full cross section , provided one uses @xmath94 rather than @xmath22 in the former . on the contrary",
    ", this is not the case for the hadronic component of the cross section , as already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the hadroproduction case : power suppressed mass terms happen to be important in the moderate @xmath22 region .",
    "this suggests that a proper merging like the one studied in this paper is necessary and superior to just employing a massless approach .",
    "the results obtained with our procedure are in good agreement with the fixed - order calculations at moderate transverse momenta , and with the so - called massless resummation ( or fragmentation function ) approach at very large momenta , effectively interpolating , in a theoretically sound manner , between the two approaches .",
