    "recently , there have been extensive efforts to draw parallels between dense granular systems , foams , emulsions , and glassy molecular systems @xcite . for such systems approaching the glass / jamming transition ,",
    "the dynamics slow down due to an increasing intrication of the available phase space , with rearrangements taking the form of cage jumps @xcite . in this regime , particles are trapped by their neighbors at short timescales and resume diffusive behavior at long timescales due to eventual loss of correlation in the succession of jumps .",
    "such jumps involve cooperatively - rearranging regions which induce dynamical heterogeneities @xcite , and the particles pass each other only rarely . the growth in size of these rearranging regions",
    "is believed to be associated with the rigidity and loss of ergodicity exhibited by fragile glasses .",
    "unlike glassy molecular systems , granular materials permit the tracking of individual particles .",
    "the average dynamics have traditionally been characterized by the mean squared displacement , @xmath4 .",
    "when the experimental timescale is long enough compared to the viscous timescale , permitting a complete decorrelation in the particle motion , it is possible to calculate the self - diffusion constant @xmath0 .",
    "this coefficient is a _",
    "single_-particle measure in which all information regarding relative motions of particles is discarded .",
    "in contrast , recent experiments and simulations @xcite have shown that the dynamics near the glass transition become heterogeneous in both space and time .",
    "as such , it is necessary to take relative motions into account when formulating the correct average description of the state . to this end , _",
    "multi_-particle scalars have been developed , including the four - point susceptibility @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , no scalars have been introduced which characterize mixing effects , which may be relevant to quantifying the cooperative motion of particles .",
    "the central observation of this paper is that the trajectories of a two - dimensional assembly of grains take the form of a _ braid _ when plotted in a space - time diagram , as shown in figure  [ fig : apparatus ] .",
    "each strand of the braid represents the space - time trajectory of a single particle in the system , with the length of the braid corresponding to time and the entanglement of the strands arising from dynamics .",
    "the topological braid entropy , @xmath1 , is a measure of the degree of this entanglement .",
    "this approach has been successfully used to analyze the mixing efficiency in two - dimensional fluid flows @xcite .",
    "specifically , the degree of lagrangian chaos created by the motion of rods in a fluid is quantitatively related to the topology of the corresponding braid .",
    "we anticipate that this notion might also be applicable to characterizing caging and dynamical heterogeneity in granular systems , by providing a quantitative measure of how close a system is to departing from ergodicity .    here",
    ", we experimentally investigate the behavior of the average topological braid entropy extracted from the long - time dynamics of particles in a dense , driven granular material , examining the dependence on boundary conditions ( constant pressure , cp , and constant volume , cv ) and the inter - particle friction coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "we analyze the dynamics with two methods : a single - particle method ( the self - diffusion constant , @xmath0 ) and a _ topological _ multi - particle method ( the braid entropy , @xmath1 ) .",
    "we find that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are sensitive to the packing density @xmath7 and pressure @xmath8 of the system in the same qualitative way .",
    "however , at high @xmath7 and @xmath8 , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are inaccessible due to insufficiently long experimental timescales or ill - definedness .",
    "in contrast , the _ braiding factor _ can be readily computed and offers an instantaneous view of the magnitude and intermittency of the rearrangements in the system .",

    "we conduct experiments on a two - dimensional granular assembly supported upon a nearly - frictionless horizontal air table and agitated by bumpers around the boundary .",

    "the concentration of small / large grains is fixed at @xmath13 , so as to occupy similar areas .",
    "the apparatus is shown in figure  [ fig : apparatus ] .    the boundary condition and the inter - particle friction @xmath6",
    "can be changed for each experimental run .",
    "the boundary condition is established by the configuration of the piston ( @xmath14 ) . by attaching weights to the piston via a low - friction pulley ,",
    "the system is confined under constant pressure ( cp ) with a range of pressures @xmath15mn / m . the constant volume ( cv )",
    "boundary condition is established by fixing the piston to the table , where a range of packing densities @xmath16 to @xmath17 is explored by removing units of particles ( two small and one large ) , maintaining the relative concentration . the inter - particle friction is selected by changing the material around the particles outer edge , with @xmath18 for ptfe ( teflon ) wrapping , @xmath19 for bare polystyrene , and @xmath20 for rubber .    around the boundary , an array of bumpers agitates the system on three sides .",
    "bumpers are triggered pairwise via a computer at a high frequency ( @xmath21 hz ) to keep particles in motion despite energy dissipated in collisions .",
    "a triggered pair consists of a bumper and its corresponding bumper on the opposite wall .",
    "we have previously measured @xcite that the effect of this driving system is to provide a thermal - like bath which maintains the granular material at constant average kinetic energy .",

    "the diffusion behavior is quantified using the mean - squared displacement @xmath33 where the average @xmath34 is performed over all particles @xmath35 and all times @xmath36 . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] ,",
    "the slope of @xmath4 is not constant for all timescales @xmath37 .",
    "it is useful to define a local curve @xmath38 , where the value of @xmath39 characterizes the average individual dynamics associated with that @xmath37 . for short timescales ( @xmath40 ) ,",
    "the trajectories remain sub - diffusive , with @xmath41 .",
    "this arises because the particles are locally confined , or caged , by neighboring particles @xcite . at longer timescales ( @xmath42 )",
    ", each particle has experienced multiple cage - breaking events and thus resumes diffusive behavior . for timescales",
    "at which @xmath43 , we can measure the two - dimensional self - diffusion coefficient @xmath44 .",
    "finally , if the diffusion process is fast enough , a typical particle covers a distance of many particle diameters within the duration of the experiment . in such cases",
    ", the exponent @xmath39 can again fall below unity at long times , due to the finite size of the experiment .",
    "this effect is visible in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] for the lowest @xmath7 at which we perform experiments .    in general",
    ", it is possible to calculate @xmath0 using @xmath4 for experiments which are of long enough duration to reach the @xmath43 regime . for this system , we find that this regime is reached even at values of @xmath7 near static random loose packing @xcite",
    ". a convenient means to measure @xmath0 is to specify a tolerance on @xmath39 which defines a diffusive regime , marked by @xmath32 symbols in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] .",
    "we calculate @xmath0 by fitting to the largest continuous region where the smoothed derivative of @xmath4 has a slope @xmath45 .",
    "the diffusive timescale @xmath46 is the timescale at which the particle motion first achieves diffusive behavior . with increasing packing density @xmath7",
    ", @xmath46 becomes longer , as seen in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] . for systems with large @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the range of @xmath37 over which @xmath4 was used to find @xmath0 ( marked with crosses in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] ) becomes less than a decade .",
    "given the constraint that @xmath47 and the finite duration of our experiment @xmath48s , it is not always possible to calculate a diffusion constant for systems with large @xmath8 or @xmath7 .",
    "one such example ( @xmath49 , @xmath50mn / m ) is shown in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] .",
    "a more conservative tolerance specification on @xmath39 would further decrease the experiments for which we could calculate a meaningful value of @xmath0 . in many experiments where we would wish to quantify the self - diffusion of particles",
    ", @xmath0 is in fact poorly - defined .",
    "the braid entropy is a measure of the _ degree of entanglement _ of trajectories @xcite . to define it , first consider an imaginary rubber band enclosing the strings at the bottom of the braid shown in figure  [ fig : apparatus]c .",
    "as we slide the rubber band upwards , its length  @xmath51 will tend to grow , as it is caught on the strings and is not allowed to traverse them .",
    "if the trajectories are chaotic , then  @xmath51 will grow exponentially ; the growth rate is then related to the lyapunov exponent of a dynamical system .",
    "the braid entropy  @xmath1 is defined as the asymptotic growth rate of  @xmath51 , @xmath52 maximized over the choice of rubber band .",
    "this rubber band viewpoint is well - illustrated by taffy pullers and dough - kneading devices , where material is made to stretch exponentially by repeated folding @xcite .",
    "the length @xmath51 is called the _ braiding factor_.",
    "when trajectories arise from a continuous dynamical system , then the braid entropy is a lower bound on the _ topological entropy _ of the system .",
    "the topological entropy is a measure of the loss of information about the identity of trajectories  it is an entropy in the sense of information theory . as more trajectories are included , the braid entropy converges to the topological entropy  @xcite .",
    "however , in a granular medium such as the one considered here , there is no underlying continuous dynamical system : the braid entropy is not necessarily related to some intrinsic topological entropy .",
    "for the same experimental runs shown in figure  [ fig : diffusion ] , with @xmath30 to @xmath53 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath54 divided by its value at the maximum time , @xmath55 . ]",
    "we follow the method described in @xcite to calculate a good approximation to the braid entropy .",
    "this is a symbolic approach based on earlier work  @xcite where a braid is first converted into its algebraic group representation for a particular choice of projection axis , and then used to measure the growth of hypothetical loops similar to the rubber band described above .",
    "we calculate the braiding factor @xmath51 using the trajectories of @xmath56 particles . because particles can enter and leave the region captured by the camera , this choice of number provides a compromise between having too many particles with missing points in the trajectory , and too few particles with the maximum trajectory duration .",
    "we find that this choice of @xmath57 is sufficient for @xmath51 to capture the dynamics of the whole system , as will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the algebraic group representation is constructed from a list of the crossing times and identities of the particles involved in each crossing .",
    "linear interpolation is used to determine the instant of crossing along the projection line , and thus obtain the braid generators .",
    "the experimental data is sufficiently well - resolved for this method @xcite to accurately capture crossings .",
    "the braid entropy @xmath1 ( see equation  [ eq : sbraid ] ) is measured from the growth rate of the logarithm of the braiding factor . to obtain a single value for a particular run ,",
    "we calculate a linear fit to @xmath54 .",
    "this entropy will be well - defined if @xmath54 meets three conditions : grows linearly in time , is an extensive quantity , and is independent of the choice of projection axis .",
    "we can directly check each of these conditions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : braid ] , we show @xmath54 for systems identical to figure  [ fig : diffusion ] , omitting the ( @xmath49 , @xmath58mn / m ) system as too few persistent crossings occur .",
    "we find @xmath54 grows , on average , linearly with time for @xmath59 . in the inset , @xmath54 is divided by its value at the maximum time , to highlights how the degree of linearity present at different values of @xmath60 .",
    "to test the extensivity of @xmath1 , we repeat the calculation described above for different numbers of particle trajectories , and test whether @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "figure  [ fig : sovern ] shows the results of this test for a series of cp experiments at different @xmath7 . for @xmath62 , we observe that @xmath61 is quite flat , independent of boundary condition , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "this observation is consistent with @xmath1 being an extensive quantity .",
    "for very small ensembles of trajectories , @xmath63 ( less than 10% of the system size ) , we find that the braid is too sparse to be representative of the dynamics of the system .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to test for extensivity in systems with low @xmath7 . in this regime",
    ", particles have a larger diffusion constant and are therefore more likely to enter and leave the region being monitored by the camera .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to find @xmath64 particles which all satisfy the constraint on the minimum duration of continuous trajectories required to make a calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "we compute @xmath51 for @xmath65 projections along axes oriented from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , and compare the results in figure  [ fig : srotation ] for two characteristic systems , both confined at cp and with @xmath29 but at different @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for the example at low @xmath7 , we observe that @xmath54 is quite linear , even on short timescales , and that the choice of projection axis has little effect on the slope of @xmath54 or @xmath1 .",
    "however , in the higher-@xmath7 example , @xmath54 grows more quickly for the @xmath68-projection than for the @xmath69-projection , where the difference in entropy is @xmath70 . increasing @xmath57 decreases the difference in entropy between projections . in the limit of long experiment duration",
    ", such differences in calculated entropies would be expected to vanish .    in examining the runs at large @xmath7 and large @xmath8",
    ", we note the occurrence of two important features in @xmath54 : flat regions and steep increases . in figure",
    "[ fig : srotation]b ( representative of such systems ) , we observe that @xmath54 may remain constant for an extended period of time , as in this case for the interval @xmath71 s. such a flat @xmath51 curve signifies that particles are _ not _ exchanging neighbors . the second feature to note in figure  [ fig :",
    "srotation]b is the sharp increases in @xmath54 beginning around @xmath72  s , for all choices of projection axis .",
    "such steps correspond to a large number of crossings , no matter the chosen orientation , and therefore signify a collective rearrangement of particles ( cage - breaking event ) .",
    "another such event can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : braid ] just after @xmath73  sec . due to these events ,",
    "the slope of @xmath54 can be much larger on short timescales .",
    "as such , the assumption that @xmath54 grows linearly in time is _ not _",
    "valid for short timescales .",
    "however , we find @xmath1 is well - defined for systems where ( @xmath59 , @xmath74 ) as @xmath54 is linear on the experimental timescale , extensive , and independent of axis of projection .",
    "based on prior work @xcite , we expect @xmath0 to decrease as @xmath7 increases .",
    "indeed , in figure  [ fig : comparison]ab , @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath7 and @xmath8 , independent of boundary condition ( cp and cv ) .",
    "similarly , we find that @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as shown in figure  [ fig : comparison]cd , respectively .",
    "error bars represent the average standard error of @xmath1 from the set of 9 projections on axes oriented from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , where the magnitude of the standard error of @xmath1 is @xmath75 and does not depend on @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we observe little dependence on the inter - particle friction coefficient @xmath6 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , though qualitatively @xmath0 decreases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "as discussed earlier , an experimental measurement of @xmath0 using @xmath76 requires a constraint on the value of @xmath39 to be used to find @xmath0 , which was selected to be @xmath47 . for systems with high @xmath8",
    ", this constraint was not met and therefore @xmath0 is poorly defined , as shown in figure  [ fig : comparison]ab .",
    "similarly , @xmath1 is also poorly - defined for high @xmath8 systems as @xmath54 no longer grows linearly within the experimental timescale . for systems with @xmath77 and @xmath78  mn / m , neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 are useful for measuring the dynamics even with long experimental timescales of @xmath79s ( @xmath80 hr ) .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the global braid entropy @xmath1 associated with the long - time dynamics of a dense granular assembly , and find it to be a well - defined quantity .",
    "notably , @xmath1 was observed to be extensive , making it a promising candidate to play a role in the elaboration of a proper equation of state for dense granular systems .",
    "the breakdown in the measurement of @xmath1 coincides with the loss of diffusive dynamics , which is to be expected due to the association of the onset of caging behavior with a loss of ergodicity .",
    "the measurement of both @xmath1 and the single - particle diffusion coefficient @xmath0 provide a quantitative measure of the degree to which slower individual dynamics also results in poorer mixing . in spite of the fact that @xmath0 is a single - particle measurement",
    ", we find that it is a good predictor of the degree of mixing .",
    "one benefit of characterizing the average dynamics with @xmath1 instead of @xmath0 is that no arbitrary fitting parameters are necessary : the method is fully specified by the trajectories themselves .",
    "in addition to providing a measure of the average behavior , the braiding factor @xmath51 provides a simple way to identify temporal events governing the dynamics ( the crossings ) . in particular , @xmath51 displays increasing intermittency as the packing density or pressure is increased , with successions of plateaus and jumps indicative of collective neighborhood changes , or structural rearrangements .",
    "in fact , this departure from linearity can provide a measure of the chaoticity / ergodicity of the dynamics .",
    "the duration required to reach an acceptable degree of linearity , independent of projection axis , is a measurement of a characteristic dynamical timescale of the system .",
    "from this point of view , the experimental timescales over which we have investigated our dense granular systems were comparable or larger than this equilibration time , with the exception of the highest @xmath8 and @xmath7 systems we tested . for our experimental timescale ,",
    "a loss of ergodicity was observed for systems with close proximity to the static jamming transition .",
    "this investigation represents a first step towards a more systematic and controlled characterization of the braid entropy in two - dimensional granular systems .",
    "the braiding factor @xmath51 may be a means of obtaining system trajectories which could be analyzed with the recently developed thermodynamics of histories @xcite .",
