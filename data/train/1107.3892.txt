    "the concept of the brane and brane world exhibits broad possibilities in the particle theory beyond the standard model . in the early stage of study on the higher dimensional theories",
    ", it has been considered that we may live in a domain wall perpendicular to the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "the domain wall may be described by a kink configuration of an self - interacting scalar field .",
    "the matter field which couples to the kink is localized in the extra dimension and acquires a mass spectrum consisting both discrete and continuum modes in general .",
    "even if we consider the model with a compact dimension , the kink or solitonic configuration is expected to play important roles .",
    "the localization of fermions due to solitonic domain walls can explain the hierarchy in masses and the yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "the compactified dimension is taken as @xmath0 or @xmath1 in such a case .",
    "the kink solutions in the periodic compact space are known to be topologically unstable like sphalerons .",
    "they have been studied by some authors  @xcite .    in the recent decade ,",
    "another approach to the particle physics models has been explored .",
    "the idea of dimensional deconstruction  @xcite is to construct the models mimicking the higher dimensional gauge theory from the four dimensional gauge theory . in some sense",
    ", the deconstruction means introducing the discrete extra space into the theory .",
    "some merits of higher dimensional theory can be inherited by four dimensional theory , whose high - energy behavior can be well controlled .    therefore it is worth examining the ` deconstructed kink model ' in the framework of four dimensional theory .",
    "fortunately , discrete models for kink - like solutions have been considered apart from particle physics  @xcite .",
    "thus we must study the solutions with specific boundary conditions and especially coupling to fermions to apply the discrete models to particle physics .",
    "most general starting point is to consider the multi - scalar model in four dimensions , whose lagrangian density reads @xmath2 where @xmath3 are real scalar fields and @xmath4 is the potential . unlike the original dimensional deconstruction scheme , the gauge invariance is not assumed .",
    "moreover even if the continuum limit is uniquely defined , it is known that the discretized action can be exhibited by various different forms  @xcite .",
    "since the other guiding principles are needed for detailed study , we will refer the supersymmetric model as shown later .",
    "the original dimensional deconstruction is found to be associated with the graph structure  @xcite .",
    "thus we begin with considering the bilinear term in scalar fields and construct the interaction terms on vertices or edges of a graph taking the correspondence with the continuum theory into consideration .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the kink solution in @xmath5-dimensional field theory .",
    "since we must include fermions later , we consider a supersymmetric theory ; the structure of this theory will be referred in the later sections . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we consider discretized or deconstructed free scalar models , whose continuum limit is the compactified theory with @xmath0 or @xmath1 . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we choose the form of the scalar interactions , which is expected to make the ` discrete kink ' configurations possible .",
    "the result of numerical calculations on the solitonic solutions is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . in sec .",
    "[ fermion ] , we consider the yukawa coupling of fermions and scalars .",
    "various ` discrete ' versions of the yukawa coupling are possible , though their ` continuum ' limits are all the same one . in this paper , we consider the models whose couplings are similar to those of the supersymmetric model mentioned in sec .",

    "the last section is devoted to summary and prospects .",
    "in this section , we review a continuum theory for kink solutions @xcite .",
    "the form of the action is used to determine the way for discretization of bosonic as well as fermionic sector later .",
    "we consider the @xmath5-dimensional supersymmetric field theory , whose lagrangian density is @xmath6 where we choose the superpotential @xmath7 as @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants .",
    "then the bosonic part of the lagrangian density reads @xmath11 and thus we find the equation of motion as @xmath12    a non trivial static solution , a kink solution , satisfies the equation of motion , and expressed as @xmath13 where we set an integration constant for @xmath14 .",
    "one can find that this solution also satisfies @xmath15    the coupling of the scalar and the ( majorana ) fermion is proportional to @xmath16 . in the present case ,",
    "it is not surprising and is of the usual yukawa form .",
    "this coupling with general coupling constant ( say , @xmath17 ) or similar type of models have been investigated in the soliton physics  @xcite .",
    "the solitonic configurations in the periodic compact space have also been considered in several authors  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that he nature of quasi - stable solutions depends on the size of the compact space .",
    "a solution of ( [ bps ] ) is not necessarily a solution of the equation of motion in the compact space .",
    "interestingly , these features are also true in some sense for the case of discrete solitons studied in sec .",
    "suppose @xmath18 real scalar fields @xmath3 @xmath19 .",
    "the mass spectrum of the scalars is the same as that of the vector bosons in the dimensional deconstruction model  @xcite , if the action is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a mass scale . in the four - dimensional point of view",
    ", we can say that the potential is of a ` difference - squared ' type .",
    "the sum in the potential is interpreted as @xmath23 and from @xmath24 to @xmath18 .",
    "then the large @xmath18 limit leaving @xmath25 constant leads to the five dimensional scalar theory with @xmath0 ( kaluza - klein ) compactification .",
    "namely , the @xmath26 mass - square matrix in this model is @xmath27 and the eigenvalues are @xmath28 which becomes @xmath29 in the large @xmath18 limit mentioned above . here",

    "the other summation rule is possible .",

    "the @xmath26 mass - square matrix becomes @xmath32 and its eigenvalues are @xmath33 and the large @xmath18 limit yields the theory with the compactification on @xmath1 .    in conclusion",
    "so far , the construction of the potential is associated with the structure of a graph , in the sense of graph theory  @xcite .",
    "a graph consists of vertices and edges each of which connects two vertices .",
    "the edge @xmath34 connects the vertices @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the vertex @xmath35 means the origin of the edge @xmath34 while the vertex @xmath36 means the terminus of the edge @xmath34 .",
    "we assign @xmath18 scalar fields onto @xmath18 vertices of the graph and their action is written by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the set of vertices and edges , respectively .",

    "for the first case introduced in this section , the incidence matrix is @xmath46 and its transposed matrix is @xmath47 the corresponding graph is the _ cycle graph _ in the term of graph theory ( fig .",
    "[ cp ] ) .     and the path graph @xmath48 .",
    "each suffix indicates the number of vertices in the graph.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]   and the path graph @xmath48 .",
    "each suffix indicates the number of vertices in the graph.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    note that @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is known as a graph laplacian for a cycle graph .    for the second case introduced in this section , the incidence matrix is @xmath51 and its transposed matrix",
    "is @xmath52 the corresponding graph is the _ path graph _ in the term of graph theory ( fig .",
    "[ cp ] ) . note that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is known as a graph laplacian for a path graph .    in the next section",
    ", we will examine the nonlinear interaction of scalars , which is essential for the kink - like configurations , by referring the graph structure .",
    "in the previous section , the term corresponding to the kinetic term of the scalar theory has been simply discretized .",
    "however , we should consider some constraints to the interaction term in the discretized action , because there are many possible descretizations which have the same continuum limit .",
    "first of all , we want to avoid apparently complicated interactions .",
    "we postulate renormalizability , at least superficially . at most four scalar fields coupled mutually at a point in four dimensions .",
    "secondly , we wish to consider models possessing a continuum limit for a large number of four - dimensional scalar field . in this limit ,",
    "the static configuration is much alike kinks or sphalerons on @xmath1 or @xmath0 .",
    "thirdly , the structure of the interaction should reflect a graph structure .",
    "the deconstructed ` kinetic term ' is expressed as a sum over edges of a graph as shown in the previous section , so the deconstructed interaction term should also be written as a sum of the contribution assigned at edges .    now",
    "the possible lagrangian density is the following : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are dimensionless constants and we consider only a path graph or a cycle graph , corresponding to the continuum theory on @xmath1 or @xmath0 , respectively .    for a cycle or path graph ,",
    "the potential term in the sense of the four - dimensional theory is @xmath58 setting the derivative with respect to @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is not @xmath61 or @xmath18 for the case with a path graph ) to zero yields the recurrence relation among three terms .",
    "unfortunately , it seems that this recurrence relation can not be satisfied by multiple use of some recurrence relations in two terms .",
    "thus for a finite number of fields , similar relations to the continuum theory like ( [ bps ] ) can not hold .    because this is still far from a specific model due to arbitrary numbers @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we select the case by special conditions @xmath62 .",
    "this selection was adopted first by speight and ward ( in @xcite ) . in this case , we find @xmath63 this relation shows that the derivative of the superpotential @xmath64 is replaced by the difference @xmath65 , or @xmath66 thus in this case , we can say that the interaction terms is related to the graph structure .    for @xmath62 , which we concentrate on this case hereafter , the potential minimum is given by the simultaneous equations @xmath67 where @xmath60 is not @xmath61 or @xmath18 for the case with a path graph . to obtain static scalar configurations , we should solve the recursion relation ( [ zenka ] ) for a cycle graph , and for a path graph with additional ` boundary ' equations , @xmath68",
    "we can look for symmetric configurations by numerical calculations .",
    "the recursion relation ( [ zenka ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "although the third order equations can be analytically solved , here we use _ mathematica _ and the command findmimimum to solve the solution for potential minima , without detailed analysis on numerical errors .",
    "this is partly because our model is still a toy model and because we consider only modest number of fields as a considerable field theory .",
    "we try to find non trivial solution for @xmath72 for both cases with path and cycle graphs .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the solitonic profile for @xmath73 . even for the small number of @xmath18 , a non trivial configuration exists for a sufficiently large value for @xmath74 .",
