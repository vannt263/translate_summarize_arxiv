    "quantum mechanics has been part of physics for nearly ninety years and is used to understand and develop much of our everyday technology . yet , while its mathematical application to physical problems is undisputed , the same can not be said for the conceptual view of the microscopic world that quantum mechanics provides .",
    "serious issues arose early with the wave - particle duality of the electromagnetic field introduced by planck and einstein , which was extended to matter waves by de broglie .",
    "depending on the nature of the experiment , these systems exhibited wave or particle - like behavior .    probably the system most commonly used to demonstrate the wave - particle duality is the double - slit experiment @xcite . under appropriate conditions , the probability that a particle will strike a screen after passing through two slits exhibits interference in the same form as the intensity of a classical light wave passing through similar slits . in the quantum case ,",
    "the wave amplitude leading to interference is a complex vector in an abstract hilbert space rather than a physical electric field or pressure wave amplitude which can be measured ( in principle ) .",
    "furthermore , as feynman demonstrated dramatically @xcite , the amount of interference one observes for quantum particles depends on whether one looks to see which slit the particle pass through .",
    "if one does nt place a detector to observe the slit passage , one sees the full interference pattern , but if the detector is present , the interference pattern disappears .",
    "thus , the amount of quantum interference one observes depends on the amount of `` which - slit '' information one obtains . however , feynman only considered two extreme cases involving which - way information  having no knowledge or perfect knowledge . in practice , one only has partial information over which path a particle may have taken , and this case was first investigated for the double - slit experiment by wootters and zurek @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a number of authors @xcite have considered the effect of having partial which - way information on interference in other two path systems , developing a simple mathematical relationship which we will now consider .    to characterize the amount of interference observed , one usually uses the visibility @xmath1 which measures the contrast of the interference maxima and minima , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are adjoining maximum and minimum intensities , respectively , that are observed by a detector as some parameter is varied .    to quantify which - way information for a two - path system",
    ", we will follow englert @xcite and distinguish two types of quantities .",
    "the thought experiment considered by feynman would involve path distinguishability @xmath6 , a parameter characterizing _ a posteriori _ which - way information , information gained during the experiment . in feynman",
    "s case , this would be due to an interaction coupling the particles to the detector .",
    "alternatively , an unstable particle can give away its position by decaying .",
    "in the case of an excited atom emitting a photon , or a large molecule emitting thermal black body radiation , the particle becomes entangled with the decay products , in which case a loss of coherence and interference results .",
    "one can show the @xmath6 and @xmath1 satisfy the duality relation @xcite @xmath7 where the equality occurs when the system is in a coherent state . for feynman s extreme cases , perfect path detection ( @xmath8 ) results in complete loss of interference contrast ( @xmath9 ) , while no path detection ( @xmath10 ) leads to maximum contrast in the interference pattern ( @xmath11 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we are focusing our attention on quantum _ undecayed _ unstable particles ( quups ) that do not decay while in the apparatus , in which case the path distinguishability vanishes .",
    "we use the redundant term _",
    "undecayed _ to distinguish an atom in an excited state ( a quup ) from the same atom in the ground state after it has decayed , either of which can contribute to an interference pattern .",
    "one might then expect that the interference pattern would be the same for quups as for stable particles in the same experiment , but we will show that in the double - slit and colella - overhauser - werner ( cow ) @xcite experiments that this is not the case . in these cases ,",
    "the instability creates an asymmetry between the probability that the quup took one path over the other which provides which - way information available _ before _ the experiment is performed .",
    "following englert , we will quantify this _ a priori _ which - way information using path predictability @xcite , which we will write as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the probability that a particle will reach the detector via path @xmath14 .",
    "this definition accommodates situations where @xmath15 , i.e. , when some of the particles that enter the apparatus fail to reach either detector .",
    "this may occur when one uses unstable particles or when an absorbing medium is placed in the particle path as in the experiments summhammer , et al .",
    "one can show that @xmath0 and @xmath1 satisfy @xcite @xmath16 the purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of unstable particles in double - slit and cow - type experiments @xcite , demonstrating that the resulting interference satisfies the duality relation eq .",

    "we show how the stationary - beam results for the double - slit experiment are consistent with previous work that involved using a time - dependent approach .",

    "let us now examine the experimental issues in detecting these quup which - way effects .",

    "@xcite , who studied the effect of the decay of an atomic excited state on the atomic diffraction pattern . in this case , the lifetime of the excited state of the he * atoms used was so short ( 100  ns ) that all the excited atoms had decayed by the time they reached the detector . since we are interested in the interference of _ undecayed _ particles , an appreciable number need to reach the detector without decaying , which means @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the path length traveled by the particle . in an actual experiment , @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the average speed of the beam particles and @xmath136 is their average lifetime .",
    "while any unstable particle ( e.g , radioactive nucleus or subatomic particle ) can be used , the most practical candidates are likely to be excited atoms since they possess a considerable range in values of @xmath136 , and their excitation process can be controlled .    in order to maximize the effect of the particle instability in a double - slit or cow experiment , we need to maximize the ratio @xmath137 , where @xmath78 is the final packet separation .",
    "decreasing @xmath43 means using a particle with a shorter lifetime , which would reduce the overall signal . increasing @xmath78 may be challenging due to the finite longitudinal coherence length @xmath138 of real particle beams . for a double - slit experiment using a beam of particles with a gaussian distribution of wave numbers characterized by standard deviation @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the initial standard deviation of the spatial wave packet , we show in the appendix that the total visibility takes the form @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the gaussian beam visibility , and @xmath143 .",
    "thus , to maximize the effect of instability without being significantly suppressed by the finite coherence length , the final wave packet separation should satisfy @xmath144 . due to this condition , observing the which - way effects with quups in double - slit and cow - like experiments will be challenging .",
    "ideally one would like to modify the particle s decay rate in one of the interference paths to maximize the effect .",

    "the second approach is time - independent , applicable to time - translation invariant situations such as a steady - beam of particles , which we used in section  [ double - slit section ] . using this approach",
    ", we found that the interference patterns obtained for unstable particles differ from the corresponding interference for stable particles due to the additional which - way information available when one uses unstable particles .",
    "the suggestion that these two approaches appear to give different answers is only illusionary . in this appendix",

    "we are assuming that the time the particle takes to travel from the slits to the screen ( @xmath154 ) is much less than the time @xmath155 , for the wave packet to spread significantly , which implies @xmath156 [ this condition is not strictly necessary since the broadening of a freely propagating wave packet does not change the interference pattern which depends on the ( constant ) longitudinal coherence length @xcite . ] to compare results with the steady - beam approach , we will take the limit @xmath157 .",
