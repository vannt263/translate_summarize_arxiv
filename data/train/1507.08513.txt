    "<S> based on low temperature resistivity , heat capacity and magnetization investigations we show that the unusually strong suppression of superconductivity in lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 bsc - type superconductors in the range @xmath3@xmath40.08 is caused by the emergence of static spin polarization in the vicinity of non - magnetic lutetium impurities . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of received results points to a formation of static magnetic moments with @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 per lu - ion . </S>",

    "<S> the discovery of superconductivity at @xmath9@xmath10@xmath639 k in mgb@xmath11 @xcite stimulated a significant interest into the studies of a wide class of the alkaline - earth , rare - earth and transition - metal borides . among them , in the family of higher borides rb@xmath2 , zirconium dodecaboride ( zrb@xmath2 ) is a bcs superconductor with the highest @xmath9@xmath10@xmath66 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing detail established for zrb@xmath2 is the formation of cooper pairs through quasi - local vibrations involving zr@xmath12 ions located within truncated @xmath13@xmath14 octahedrons in the ub@xmath2-type _ fcc _ crystal structure @xcite-@xcite . in studies of </S>",
    "<S> the einstein phonon mediated superconductivity in zrb@xmath2 authors of @xcite-@xcite argue that _ s_-wave pairing is characteristic for this compound , and that in this case the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath15 is located in the nearest vicinity of the threshold value @xmath16@xmath172@xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a crossover from type - i to type - ii@xmath191 superconductivity with temperature lowering was deduced in @xcite from heat capacity and magnetization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in @xcite the superconductivity in zrb@xmath2 was interpreted in terms of _ d_-wave pairing and a two - gap type - ii regime was identified with parameters @xmath20@xmath173.8 and @xmath21@xmath175.8 . additionally , a large size pseudo - gap ( @xmath22@xmath237.3 mev ) has been detected employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy in zrb@xmath2 above @xmath9@xmath10 , and proximity to the quantum fluctuation regime was predicted from _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ band structure calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , also similarities with cuprate high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) may be supposed to revive the interest into studies of this low temperature superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> in case of non - magnetic impurity substitutions and their impact on superconducting properties one can choose between various scenarios , because for these defects the pair - breaking mechanism in various models differs . according to anderson s theorem @xcite and its extension to non-_s_-wave superconductivity ( see e.g. @xcite ) already a small amount of non - magnetic impurities can dramatically suppress superconductivity by pair - breaking in the case of anisotropic gap in a _ </S>",

    "<S> moreover , experiments on cuprates reveal @xcite that a spinless impurity ( zn , li etc . ) introduced into a htsc host produces in its vicinity a large and spatially extended alternating magnetic polarization . on the basis of nmr and @xmath24sr spectra it has been demonstrated that this impurity - induced magnetization on the nearest neighbor cu atoms in cuprates is associated with a dynamic moment @xcite .    in the case of rb@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> the replacement of non - magnetic ions of zr by lu produces an about 15 times reduction of superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath9@xmath10@xmath60.4 k for lub@xmath2 @xcite ) , and the origin of this large @xmath9@xmath10 suppression is not cleared up to now for these two compounds with similar conduction bands and crystalline structures . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , inelastic neutron scattering studies of the phonon spectra in lub@xmath2 and zrb@xmath2 @xcite have detected noticeable , but not dramatic changes in the position of almost dispersion - less quasi - local mode ( 15 mev and 17.5 mev , correspondingly ) , which was proposed to be responsible for cooper pairing . </S>",
    "<S> only a moderate difference in the electronic density of states of these two compounds is caused by filling of a wide enough conduction band ( @xmath231.6@xmath252 ev ) when lu@xmath26 @xmath27 ion is changed to zr@xmath12 in the rb@xmath2 unit cell , resulting to an elevation by about 0.3 - 0.4 ev of the fermi level @xmath28@xmath29 for zrb@xmath2 in comparison to lub@xmath2 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we probed the evolution of superconducting transition temperature @xmath9@xmath10 and the normal state parameters for substitutional solid solutions lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 employing resistivity , heat capacity and magnetization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown that the non - magnetic lu impurity substitution ( having a 4@xmath30 configuration ) produces a strong static spin polarization in the rb@xmath2 matrix in the vicinity of lutetium ions . simultaneously with the emergence of static magnetic moments with a value of about 3@xmath31 per lu ion the received experimental results exhibit a strong suppression of superconductivity in lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 .    </S>",

    "<S> is very similar to that one observed previously for lub@xmath2 @xcite , and it may be interpreted in terms of formation of two - level systems ( tls ) in the disordered rb@xmath2 matrix of this cage - glass compound . </S>",

    "<S> t@xmath10(@xmath3 ) _ dependence for lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 solid solutions is summarized in fig .. it should be stressed that the suppression of superconductivity by lu substitution is unusually strong ( @xmath230.21 k@xmath19at.@xmath39 lu ) , when supposing the doping of an _ s_-wave superconductor by non - magnetic impurities .    </S>",
    "<S> in external magnetic field the amplitude of the low temperature schottky anomaly increases essentially and _ c(t ) _ maximum moves to higher temperatures ( for example , figs . , show the data for @xmath3@xmath170.007 and 0.074 , correspondingly ) . evidently , the zeeman component is a magnetic contribution to heat capacity and it may be separated from vibrational and electron heat capacity terms following the approach developed in @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> , that a small ( @xmath234@xmath4810@xmath49 @xmath50zr ) and about temperature independent pauli - like paramagnetic response , which is typical for zrb@xmath2 , changes into a curie - weiss - type magnetic signal originating from localized magnetic moments induced by the lu substitution . </S>",

    "<S> these values correlate very well with the saturated moments @xmath56@xmath233 - 4@xmath31 per lu ion obtained from the analysis of magnetization vs. magnetic field dependences ( fig . ) .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the regime of isolated magnetic impurity for @xmath3@xmath170.007 the magnetization may be described with a good accuracy by the brillouin - type dependence    @xmath57    ( where @xmath58@xmath41@xmath27concentration of magnetic sites , @xmath13@xmath59@xmath27brillouin function , @xmath31@xmath27bohr magneton and j@xmath27angular momentum ) with @xmath58@xmath41@xmath60.48@xmath3 , g@xmath63 and j@xmath62 . as a result , it encourages us to suggest as a simplest scenario that impurity ions of lu are combined into dimmers with a magnetic moment @xmath56@xmath17gj@xmath176@xmath31 and with a size equal to about d(lu - lu)@xmath235.3 @xmath8 @xmath27 the distance between heavy ions in the rb@xmath2 matrix , which can be considered as a formation of spin - polarized nanodomains in lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 .    </S>",

    "<S> is expected in the regime of charge carrier scattering on localized magnetic moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both field and temperature dependences of nmr are controlled by local magnetization @xmath61@xmath62 through the relation    @xmath63    the nmr effect may be considered as an independent argument in favor of local moments formation in a metallic matrix . </S>",
    "<S> fig . shows the results of magnetoresisance measurements on lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 . in the normal state of zrb@xmath2 the main contribution to @xmath60__(h , t@xmath42 ) _ _ is positive and it can be described with a good accuracy by the well - known relation @xmath60@xmath23@xmath64@xmath65@xmath36@xmath65 , where @xmath64 is the carriers drift mobility . both the substitutional disorder and the cage - glass effect in lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 decrease dramatically both the mobility and amplitude of the positive component when lu concentration increases ( fig . ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath3@xmath660.015 the appearance of nmr contribution to @xmath60 becomes evident , and for @xmath3@xmath230.07 the negative term in applied magnetic fields ( fig . ) </S>",

    "<S> , the scattering of charge carriers on localized moments in vicinity of impurity sites appears below 8 k and increases drastically with temperature lowering . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64(t ) _ dependence demonstrates only a moderate elevation with temperature decrease ( fig . ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these positive and negative components of magnetoresistance become comparable at helium temperatures and in magnetic fields below 40 koe .    </S>",
    "<S> when discussing the possible scenario of the formation of spin - polarized nanodomains in this case , it is worth to note the mechanism of spin - polaron formation proposed for the rare earth higher borides with a cage - glass structure . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested in @xcite that fast quantum oscillations of heavy rare earth ions in a double - well potential lead to spin polarization of _ 5d_-conduction band states , and this effect appears to be very sensitive to external magnetic field . turning to the analogy with non - magnetic impurity - induced _ dynamic _ moments in htsc cuprates , it should be stressed here that the localized moments found in present study of lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 are _ static _ and that a strong enhancement of spin polarization ( exhibiting a saturation above 40 koe ) is induced by external magnetic field .    to summarize , we have found a formation of static magnetic moments with @xmath5@xmath63@xmath31 per lu - ion in the vicinity of non - magnetic lutetium impurities in the zr - rich matrix of lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 dodecaborides at low temperatures . according to our opinion </S>",
    "<S> , the strong suppression of superconductivity in lu@xmath0zr@xmath1b@xmath2 compounds should be attributed to pair - breaking arising in the vicinity of these nanosize magnetic domains .    </S>",
