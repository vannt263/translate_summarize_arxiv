    "at low energies , the main features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) are confinement and the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the former implies that we only observe hadrons ( rather than quarks and gluons ) , while the latter is believed to govern the ( low - lying ) hadron - mass spectrum .",
    "lattice - qcd calculations predict a phase transition from nuclear / hadronic matter to a deconfined , chirally symmetric state  @xcite at temperatures @xmath5@xmath6150 - 200  mev , dictating a major reshaping of the hadronic spectrum in terms of degenerate chiral partners .",
    "the observation of such medium modifications is therefore an important objective in relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "large theoretical efforts have been devoted to evaluate in - medium properties of vector mesons which are accessible experimentally through dilepton invariant - mass spectra  @xcite . in most of these studies ,",
    "baryon - driven effects are essential to account for the dilepton enhancement observed in @xmath7-@xmath3 collisions at the sps below the free @xmath8 mass  @xcite .",
    "thus , changes in the baryon properties themselves deserve further investigation . in addition , recent measurements of @xmath2 invariant - mass spectra in nuclear collisions  @xcite may open a more direct window on modifications of the @xmath0(1232 ) .    to date ,",
    "in - medium properties of the @xmath0 have mostly been assessed in cold nuclear matter  @xcite , with few exceptions  @xcite . in this article",
    "we will discuss properties of the nucleon and the @xmath0(1232 ) in a hot and dense medium  @xcite , employing a finite - temperature field theory framework based on hadronic interactions .",
    "both direct interactions of the @xmath0 with thermal pions as well as modifications of its free @xmath2 self - energy ( incuding vertex corrections ) will be accounted for .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect.2 ] we introduce the hadronic lagrangian and outline how its parameters are determined using scattering and decay data in vacuum . in sec .",
    "[ sect.3 ] we compute in - medium self - energies for nucleon and @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sect.4 ] we first check our model against photoabsorption cross sections on the nucleon and nuclei , followed by a discussion of the spectral functions under conditions expected to occur in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we close with a summary and outlook .",
    "the basic element of our analysis are 3-point interaction vertices involving a pion and two baryons , @xmath9 .",
    "baryon fields are treated using relativistic kinematics , @xmath10 , but neglecting anti - particle contributions and restricting rarita - schwinger spinors to their non - relativistic spin-3/2 components .",
    "pions are treated fully relativisticly ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the resulting interaction lagrangians are thus of the usual nonrelativistic form involving ( iso- ) spin-1/2 pauli matrices , 1/2 to 3/2 transition operators , as well as spin-3/2 matrices  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for explicit expressions . to simulate finite - size effects we employed hadronic form factors with a uniform cutoff parameter @xmath12  mev ( except for @xmath13 and @xmath14 vertices ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the vacuum self - energy for the @xmath0@xmath15@xmath16 decay takes the form @xmath17 with @xmath18 the center - of - mass decay momentum ( an extra factor @xmath19 has been introduced in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) to restore lorentz - invariance ) , and the real part is determined via a dispersion relation . with a bare mass of @xmath20=1302  mev ,",
    "a form - factor cutoff @xmath21=290  mev and a coupling constant @xmath22 we obtain a satisfactory fit to the experimental @xmath23-phase shift  @xcite .    to account for resonant interactions of the @xmath0 with pions we identified the relevant excited baryons via their decay branchings @xmath24@xmath25@xmath1 .",
    "the pertinent coupling constants have been determined assuming the lowest partial wave to be dominant ( unless otherwise specified )  @xcite , using pole masses and ( total ) widths of the resonances .",
    "the same procedure has been adopted for resonant @xmath2 interactions ( which are used to evaluate finite - temperature effects on the nucleon ) .",
    "the resonances included are @xmath26(1440 ) , @xmath26(1520 ) , @xmath26(1535 ) , @xmath0(1600 ) , @xmath0(1620 ) and @xmath0(1700 ) .",
    "the total widths figuring into the resonance propagators have been obtained by scaling up the partial @xmath2 and @xmath1 channels , and vacuum renormalizations of the masses have been neglected .",
    "finally , the evaluation of the photoabsorption cross section requires a @xmath27 vertex for which we employ the magnetic coupling  @xcite @xmath28",
    "the interactions described in the previous section are now used to evaluate the @xmath0 self - energy in hot hadronic matter .",
    "the first modification concerns the @xmath2 loop which we obtain within the matsubara formalism as @xmath29 { a}_{\\pi}(k ) g_n(l ) -f^n(l_0 ) a_n(l ) g_{\\pi}(k ) \\rbrace \\ , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the pion 4-momentum .",

    "( [ sgdnpi ] ) positive energies @xmath39@xmath380 correspond to outgoing pions , i.e. , @xmath0@xmath15@xmath2 decays , while @xmath39@xmath400 accounts for scattering with ( incoming ) pions from the heat bath .    the key quantities in eq .",
    "( [ sgdnpi ] ) are the in - medium pion and nucleon propagators , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and pertinent spectral functions @xmath43=@xmath44 and @xmath45=@xmath46 .",
    "the modifications of the pion propagator are implemetend via a self - energy , arising from two parts : ( i ) interactions with thermal pions modeled by a four - point interaction in second order (  sunset diagram \" )  @xcite , with a coupling constant adjusted to qualitatively reproduce the results of more elaborate @xmath47 interactions in @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50-wave  @xcite ; ( ii ) interactions with baryons via @xmath49-wave nucleon- and @xmath0-hole excitations at finite temperature , described by standard lindhard functions , supplemented by short - range correlations encoded in migdal parameters  @xcite ( our default values are @xmath51=0.8 , @xmath52=@xmath53=0.33 ) . these excitations induce a softening of the pion - dispersion relation which can even lead to a ( near ) vanishing of the pion group velocity at finite momentum , inducing an artificial threshold enhancement in the @xmath0 self - energy  @xcite .",
    "this feature is remedied by accounting for appropriate vertex corrections , which in the case of @xmath8@xmath25@xmath47 decays are required to maintain a conserved vector current in the medium  @xcite .",

    "[ fig.vcorr ] .    ]    ]    the nucleon self - energy is calculated in terms of resonant interactions with thermal pions , at the same level of approximation as the pion lindhard functions ( i.e. , neglecting off energy - shell dependencies in the spectral functions of the excited baryons ) .    the second contribution to the in - medium @xmath0 self - energy consists of resonant @xmath54 interactions , corresponding to the finite - temperature part of @xmath55 loops .",
    "the resulting self - energy expressions are similar to eq .",
