    "there is recent a regain of interest for extreme value statistics ( evs ) and its applications to physics @xcite biology @xcite and finance @xcite . characterizing the statistical properties of the maximum @xmath0 ( or the minimum @xmath1 ) of a set of @xmath2 random variables @xmath3 has recently found many applications in these various areas of research , particularly in statistical physics .",
    "indeed , being at the heart of optimization problems , evs plays a major role in the study of disordered and glassy systems .",
    "the evs of independent , or weakly correlated , and identically distributed random variables is now well understood , thanks to the identification , in the large @xmath2 ( thermodynamical ) limit , of three distinct universality classes depending on the parent distribution of the @xmath4 s @xcite .",
    "the difficult cases arise when the random variables are strongly correlated , which happens to be the case of interest in many problems encountered in statistical physics .",
    "this is the case for instance of the directed polymer in random media and its connections to kardar - parisi - zhang equation @xcite or the statistical physics of a single particle in a logarithmically correlated random potential @xcite , closely related to derrida s random energy model @xcite .",
    "the most important example of a set of strongly correlated random variables is of course brownian motion ( bm ) . and",
    "despite the fact that it has been widely studied @xcite , there has been a renewed interest in the study of functionals involving brownian motions @xcite , and in particular in the context of extreme statistics @xcite .",
    "considering a brownian motion @xmath5 on the interval @xmath6 $ ] , subject to @xmath7 , it reaches its maximum @xmath8 at time @xmath9 .",
    "the basic question we ask is : what is the joint distribution @xmath10 of these random variables ?",
    "for instance , for unconstrained brownian motion , the ( marginal ) distribution @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 or equivalently the cumulative distribution @xmath13 , which is the classical lvy s arcsine law @xcite .",
    "these classical results for bm for @xmath10 have been recently obtained using feynman - kac formula and further extended to a wider class of constrained brownian motions , including brownian excursions , meanders and reflected brownian bridge @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was shown that this joint distribution @xmath10 for a brownian motion and brownian bridge arises naturally in the study of the convex hull of planar brownian motions @xcite . recently ,",
    "such results for the distribution of the maximum @xmath14 have been obtained , using also a path - integral formalism , for the case of multidimensional processes , where one considers @xmath15 non intersecting brownian walkers ( vicious walkers )  @xcite .    on the other hand , it is interesting to extend these studies to other stochastic processes .",
    "a natural one is the bessel process , which is the radius of @xmath16dimensional brownian motion .",
    "the study of the distribution of the maximum @xmath14 for a bessel bridge has actually been widely studied in probability theory and statistics , in particular in the context of the generalization of the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( corresponding to @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "the marginal distribution @xmath14 for such bessel bridges was first computed by gikhman and kiefer @xcite and then generalized to any real @xmath18 by pitman and yor @xcite , while much less is known about @xmath19 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these results are obtained using rather complicated tools from probability theory , including the so called `` agreement formulae '' which , albeit rigorous , are not very physically intuitive ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to our knowledge",
    ", the extreme statistics of the bessel process has not been studied using the tools of statistical physics .    in this paper",
    "we will use the real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) to study these problems of extreme value statistics .",
    "the rsrg was first devised for the study of quantum spin chains with disorder @xcite .",
    "it was then applied @xcite to the study of the sinai model @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the arrhenius motion ( diffusion ) of a particle in a random potential @xmath5 which is itself a random walk , _ i.e. _ it becomes a one dimensional brownian motion in the scaling limit . in both cases",
    "the idea is to decimate iteratively the smallest energy levels ( for quantum systems ) or barriers ( for arrhenius dynamics ) , defined as variables @xmath20 where @xmath21 are pairs of successive of local min - max . at a given stage , indexed by the `` decimation scale '' called @xmath22",
    ", the landscape does not contain any barrier smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "while it is only asymptotically exact for the above mentioned problems , it was later realized @xcite that it is also a fully exact and quite powerful tool to study extreme value statistics , and that it leads to solvable equations when applied to a broad class of processes , which includes , but is not restricted to , the brownian motion .",
    "in fact it gives much more information than the frequently asked questions in extreme value statistics as it also allows one to compute the statistics of @xmath23-extrema ( as introduced in the mathematical literature by neveu and pitman @xcite ) , _ i.e. _ the extrema separated by a barrier larger than @xmath23 , and here @xmath24 . in sinai s walk , these are `` important extrema '' of the energy landscape , which are separated by large enough barriers such that the process is not authorized to backtrack on more than @xmath22 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath23-extrema in the context of sinai s walk ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the rsrg was used to obtain the extremal statistics of the toy model , _",
    "i.e. _ brownian motion plus a quadratic well .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain and illustrate how the rsrg allows one to recover known results about extrema of the most standard constrained brownian motions , _",
    "i.e. _ the bridge , the meander , the reflected bm and the excursion .",
    "it is in a sense an overkill , as we will see the method is too powerful and we only use it in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "however , in view of the versatility and importance of this method , we think that it is useful to establish some links with more classical approaches and results .",
    "since we want to be mostly pedagogical , we restrict to symmetric bm , the case of a bias being a straightforward extension . note that even for the brownian motion we compute a rather complicated object , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_unconstrained ] , at the same price as the standard , well known result for the distribution of the maximum .",
    "next we study the bessel process ( _ i.e. _ the radius of a @xmath18-dimensional brownian motion ) and obtain its extremal statistics .",
    "finally we close by a short section on the extensions to continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) .",
    "some of our results are standard well known results , derived here in a rather different fashion , others are extensions and likely to be not so well known .",
    ") for the renormalized landscape ( on the @xmath26 axis , the @xmath27 s are the bond length , and on the vertical @xmath28 axis the @xmath29 s are the barriers ) .",
    "it is a sum of terms with @xmath30 valleys ( _ i.e. _ sets of two consecutive bonds ) not yet decimated at scale @xmath22 , _ i.e. _ of barriers larger than @xmath22 ( in vertical @xmath28 direction ) .",
    "the edge bonds ( first and last ) can not be decimated , only the bulk bonds ( all the others ) are . ]",
    "let us briefly recall the main results of the rsrg method .",
    "here we restrict to the brownian motion .",
    "the general case , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is recalled later .",
    "the first statement is that the probability measure of the symmetric brownian motion @xmath5 with @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , can be written as the following sum : @xmath33 where @xmath34 . in the ( finite size ) rsrg language @xcite this is called the renormalized landscape at scale @xmath22 , with bond lengths @xmath35 and barriers @xmath36 or @xmath37 where @xmath38 are local minima and @xmath39 are local maxima , and it holds for a large class of random walk landscape with markov property .",
    "it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsrg0 ] . the transformation which increases @xmath22",
    "is called the _ decimation_.",
    "it iteratively reduces the list of extrema @xmath40 by removing a pair of adjacent min - max ( or max - min ) from the list corresponding to the smallest @xmath41 in the system , when @xmath22 crosses that value , in effect gluing three bonds into one .",
    "this results in a rg ( _ i.e. _ evolution ) equation for @xmath42 ( bulk bonds ) and @xmath43 ( edge bonds ) which eventually reaches a fixed point form which , under some conditions , corresponds exactly to the brownian motion .",
    "the edge bonds play a special role as they can not be decimated , they can only grow by decimation of their nearest neighbor . the total measure ( [ fs ] )",
    "is a sum of measures for the events where there remain @xmath44 bonds in the system , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath45 valleys of bulk bonds and two edge bonds , with @xmath46 . at large @xmath22 , for @xmath47 finite , there remains only the term @xmath48 which plays a special role .",
    "the product form reflects the markovian nature of the landscape , which is preserved by decimation , hence is either an exact consequence of the choice of a markovian initial landscape , or a consequence of the convergence to the fixed point landscape .",
    "the only constraint is the fixed total length , implemented by the delta functions .",
    "the factor @xmath49 is nothing but the average bond length which ensures the normalization of the total probability to unity .",
    "the fixed point form for the bond length probability , _",
    "i.e. _ the one corresponding to the bm , takes in laplace @xmath50 , the simple form : @xmath51 as mentioned above @xmath42 can be related to a sum over all bm which are constrained to climb from @xmath52 to @xmath41 in a time @xmath53 while remaining in the interval @xmath540,f[$ ] and with no descent of more than @xmath22 .",
    "the rsrg equations which yield the fixed point forms ( [ bulk ] , [ eg ] ) are recalled in appendix a.      in all cases one considers a brownian motion @xmath55 on the interval @xmath56 $ ] , with @xmath57 , with initial condition @xmath58 .",
    "note that this corresponds to a diffusion coefficient @xmath59 , in contrast to the value @xmath60 used in ref .",
    "@xcite to which we will refer in the following",
    ".     starting at @xmath58 and ending at @xmath61 which is free .",

    "[ fig_unconstrained ] ) , the brownian bridge is defined by the constraint @xmath70 ( see fig . [ fig_constrained ] a ) ) .",
    "it is natural to consider the joint probability density @xmath71 that the free brownian ends at @xmath61 and has maximum value @xmath72 at position @xmath73 . from the above considerations it is obtained from rsrg by considering the last block ( see fig .",

    "i.e. _ the last decimation .",
    "the measure of this last block gives the joint distribution @xmath79 ( see eq .",
    "( [ last_block ] ) ) . ]    thus using eq .",
    "( [ last_block ] ) together with the expression for the edge bond in eq .",

    "let us now investigate more complicated instances of other classical constrained brownian motions .",

    "@xmath251 before each jump .",
    "the trapping times between each jump are independent and identically distributed random variables with a common density function @xmath252 which has a power law tail , @xmath253 with @xmath254 , while the jumps themselves are distributed according to a narrow distribution .",

    "it is the purpose of this section to study them using rsrg .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that the rsrg is a quite powerful method to compute the extreme statistics of various physically relevant stochastic processes . by exploiting the solution of the rsrg equations found in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the extreme statistics of the one - dimensional brownian motion ( bm ) as well as the bessel process ( bp ) , _ i.e. _ the radius of the @xmath18-dimensional brownian motion . for the bm , we have shown that it allows to recover , in a rather different way , standard results for the brownian motion and its variants , including brownian bridge , excursion , meander as well as for the reflected brownian motion .",
    "for the bp , we have recovered in a simpler way the results of pitman and yor for the distribution of the maximum , and obtained also the distribution of its position .",
    "we have then extended this method to study the extreme statistics of the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) , which we have shown to correspond to a new fixed point of the rsrg transformation .",
    "although we have restricted our analysis to the extreme statistics of the free ctrw , various cases of constrained ctrw can be straightforwardly studied following the analysis presented above .",
    "similarly , the study of the dynamics in a disordered energy landscape generated by a ctrw could be done in principle from the analysis of the new fixed point of the rsrg exhibited here .",
    "here we recall the rsrg equation for the probability distributions of barriers and lengths in a symmetric landscape denoted @xmath306 for bulk bonds and @xmath43 for edge bonds . when convenient we use the notation @xmath307 . for bulk bonds",
    "it reads : @xmath308 and for edge bonds one has : @xmath309 in terms of laplace variable @xmath15 with respect to @xmath310 , one obtains : @xmath311 and we recall : @xmath312 it is straightforward to check that : @xmath313 is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq_edge_bond1 ] ) .",
    "we now seek a solution of ( [ rsrgp ] ) with the scaling form : @xmath314 which , as discussed in the text corresponds to a ctrw energy landscape with index @xmath315 ( we remind that one recovers the standard bm for @xmath316 ) .",
    "consider @xmath317 the laplace transform of @xmath318 w.r.t .",

    "reexpressed in the laplace variable @xmath15 associated with @xmath53 we thus find : @xmath324 this is a new class of rsrg fixed points which corresponds to broad distributions of bond length : @xmath325 while there is a typical bond length , @xmath326 the average bond length is infinite as the distribution does not have a first moment .",
    "expanding at small @xmath15 one has @xmath327 from which we find the tail @xmath328 at large @xmath53 .    for the edge bonds",
    "one finds similarly that @xmath329 is a solution ( in laplace ) of eq .",

    "hence we see , that , as claimed in the text the ctrw fixed points are obtained from the bm ones ( _ i.e. _ the standard rsrg fixed points ) by the substitution @xmath330 .",
    "there is however a subtlety concerning the finite size measure , _",
    "i.e. _ the analogous of ( [ fs ] ) .",
    "as explained in the text , it is still valid provided one interprets @xmath47 as the `` first arrival time '' of the process at @xmath61 . indeed ,",
    "if one considers @xmath331 as @xmath332 then one has @xcite",
    "@xmath333 where we have used @xmath334 ( the _ typical _ bond length ) and the above forms for the fixed point ( [ bulk_sol_ctrw ] ) , ( [ sol_edge_bond_app ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath335 for @xmath336 and this measure is not normalized ( [ fs_ctrw ] ) if @xmath336 .",
    "the reason for this is that if one considers a fixed time @xmath47 , one must then convolute the finite size measure by the waiting time function @xmath337 , which , in the language of the stochastic process corresponding to ctrw ( discussed in the main text ) , is the probability of no jump in the time interval @xmath338 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that its laplace transform behaves as @xmath339 and the condition of normalization @xmath340 yields simply @xmath289 .    another way to present our result for",
    "the finite size measure is to state that the correct generalization of ( [ fs ] ) for models with no first moment in the bond length distribution , and statistical independence of successive bonds , reads : @xmath341 with the `` waiting time '' function @xmath342 discussed above , such that @xmath343 is then correctly normalized to unity .",
    "this measure is clearly invariant under the rsrg procedure , up to the flow of @xmath344 and @xmath345 as described above .",
    "this means that the @xmath346-function constraint on total bond length in the finite size measure is only possible for the bm class .",
    "it would be very interesting to study whether a starting landscape e.g. with a fixed total length and number of bonds will indeed flow , and in which sense , to this asymptotic form . at this stage",
    "our main argument is based on ( i ) invariance of the form ( [ fs_ctrw2 ] ) under rsrg ( ii ) the ctrw interpretation given above .",
    "more generally , convergence to finite size measures has not , to our knowledge , been studied and is a fascinating subject .",
    "this however is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "let us now call @xmath347 the joint probability that the edge bond has @xmath348 and a maximum at @xmath26 of value @xmath102 .",
