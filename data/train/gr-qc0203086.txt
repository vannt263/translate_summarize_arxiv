    "binary star systems , consisting of compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars , are relatively strong sources of gravitational radiation and are expected to be prime sources for the terrestrial network of kilometer - sized interferometric gravitational wave detectors , which will soon be fully operational , or for space - based detectors such as the proposed lisa mission @xcite . in order to detect gravitational radiation and",
    "subsequently study the physics of these sources it is absolutely necessary to have a prior theoretical knowledge of their dynamics .",
    "this is especially true because of the method of matched filtering ( see @xcite for a recent review ) that is likely to be employed in order to identify true gravitational wave signals `` buried '' inside the detector s noisy output .",
    "the success of this method depends on the use of an accurate template of the incoming waveform .",
    "this paper will focus on the case of extreme mass ratio systems , modelling a massive central object which is a spinning ( kerr ) black hole while the orbiting body is `` light '' and compact enough to be considered as a test - particle moving in the gravitational field of its companion .",
    "there are two important reasons for studying such a model .",
    "firstly , due to the extreme mass ratio , the motion of the small mass can be accurately approximated by a geodesic trajectory ( which is well known @xcite ) and the system s gravitational radiation is well described by first - order black hole perturbation theory techniques .",
    "the celebrated teukolsky formalism @xcite has proven particularly successful for this task .",
    "one thus has the opportunity to make a detailed study of a fully relativistic celestial system .",
    "for this reason , black hole perturbative studies can be used as a test for numerical relativity simulations of two - body systems ( and vice versa ! ) @xcite .",
    "secondly , in recent years there has been an accumulation of evidence of the existence of supermassive black holes ( of mass range @xmath7 ) in galactic nuclei ( including our own milky way ) @xcite .",
    "it is expected that scattered stellar - mass @xmath8 compact objects from the surrounding stellar population will be captured by the central black hole as a result of two - body encounters and interactions with the inhomogeneities of the background gravitational potential .",
    "the same scenario can of course work equally well for normal stars ; however they will soon be tidally disrupted as they approach the black hole @xcite , @xcite @xcite .",
    "once in a bound orbit , the compact object will slowly inspiral towards the central black hole due to the emission of gravitational radiation . as the frequency of the emitted waves scales as @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 denotes the central black hole s mass ) , they will potentially lie in the low - frequency band ( @xmath11 ) where lisa will have its peak sensitivity .",
    "the ( still uncertain ) estimate for the number of such events is around @xmath12 , or better , out to a distance of @xmath13gpc and they should be detectable by lisa , with typical signal to noise ratios of @xmath14 , @xcite , assuming the use of some optimal filtering technique , such as matched filtering @xcite .",
    "a huge payoff from direct observations of such events is to be expected , _ provided _ we have an accurate a priori description of the emitted waveform . in principle , for instance , the black hole parameters ( masses , spins ) can be measured to a high accuracy .",
    "similarly , information on the mass - function of compact stellar populations in galactic nuclei could be provided . because the total luminosity of the source depends only on its mass it may be possible to work out the distance to the source , which would be very useful to cosmologists .",
    "moreover , one might be able to identify the massive object as a kerr black hole , as opposed to some other , more speculative object ( for example a boson star @xcite ) .",
    "this was demonstrated by ryan @xcite who showed in detail how the massive body s multipole moments are encrypted in the waveform emitted by an orbiting particle . in the near term , precise numerical results in the low - mass - ratio limit will be useful for testing the accuracy of post - newtonian ( pn ) derived templates aimed at ground based detectors like ligo @xcite , @xcite .",
    "lisa will monitor the last year of inspiral of a compact body into a massive black hole by tracking the phase of the emitted waveform .",
    "it has been suggested that for astrophysically likely scenarios , drag forces operating on the orbiting body due to gas accreting onto the black hole , will operate on a timescale much longer than the radiation reaction timescale of the particle @xcite , @xcite . based on requirements that the initial highly eccentric orbit in which the particle finds itself as the result of some scattering event should have a small enough periastron",
    "so that the radiation reaction timescale is shorter than the timescale for a second scattering event at apastron , we expect that the initial periastron should be rather close , so that @xmath15 while the apastron will extend to a distance @xmath16 @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "newtonian order estimates suggest that although radiation reaction will considerably reduce this enormous initial eccentricity during the course of the inspiral , the eccentricity will remain finite and non - negligible when the particle enters the strong - field region of interest to this paper ( see section vb below ) .",
    "exactly how much eccentricity remains will depend critically on the initial periastron distance and is largely insensitive to the initial apastron distance ( and thus to the initial eccentricity ) .",
    "we can thus argue that for a sufficiently bound orbit the system of the massive black hole and the orbiting compact object will evolve under its own spacetime dynamics .",
    "this tends to justify our `` black hole plus particle '' model .",
    "however , even in this simplified picture there are problems .",
    "the particle , in general , will move along a non - equatorial eccentric orbit ( as the galactic central stellar population is almost spherically symmetric , capture orbits of arbitrary inclination are to be expected ) .",
    "the teukolsky formalism can not , at present , deal with such orbits , for reasons discussed in @xcite , in particular the problem of determining the rate of change of the `` carter constant '' of the motion due to the emission of gravitational waves ( much effort , towards this goal , is being focused on building a framework for calculating the gravitational self - force acting on the orbiting particle @xcite ) . for this reason",
    "we restrict our attention to equatorial orbits around the central body . in such a case",
    "the rate of change of the orbital parameters can be deduced by reading the gravitational wave fluxes for the energy and angular momentum at infinity and the black hole horizon .",
    "there is , however , a factor that can not be accounted for by the previous flux - balance argument which lies at the heart of our approach .",
    "as has been observed recently @xcite , @xcite the gravitational self - force contains a conservative piece which is not associated with any radiation emission . although the effect of this conservative force is negligible ( scaling as @xmath17 ) over short timescales ( say , one orbital period ) , it is conceivable that the same will not be true for the accumulated effect after @xmath18 orbits @xcite ( this is , roughly , the number of orbits that lisa will record ) .",
    "another issue that has risen recently concerns the possible difficulty in defining the notion of adiabaticity and averaged flux for generic , i.e. eccentric and non - equatorial , orbits in kerr spacetime .",
    "this is related to the belief that generic orbits have no well - defined orbital periods as they show an apparently non - periodic behaviour .",
    "for that reason , it has been suggested @xcite that an `` ergodicity '' criterion would be more appropriate .",
    "however , recent work suggests @xcite that it is possible , after all , to rigorously define ( by means of hamilton - jacobi theory ) a triplet of fundamental frequencies for generic kerr orbits .",
    "consequently , one may still be able to define adiabaticity for these orbits too .",
    "serious complications can also arise at the level of free motion , where radiation reaction is neglected .",
    "in general , the small body will have its own intrinsic spin .",
    "in such a case , due to the coupling of the particle s spin with the background gravitational field , the motion is no longer geodesic .",
    "although the ( specific ) spin magnitude is small , i.e. @xmath19 , spin - induced effects could become important over timescales much longer than , say , one orbital period .",
    "a particularly dramatic possibility is that when the test - particle is allowed to have spin , `` chaotic '' features may appear in the orbital motion @xcite .",
    "presently it is unclear whether chaotic behaviour will be important for extreme mass ratio systems likely to be observed by lisa .    when radiation reaction is `` switched - on '' in the spinning particle case , one finds , not surprisingly , that the radiative fluxes at infinity and the horizon are inadequate for determining the evolution of the orbit .",
    "this is , in part , due to the fact that there is no known analog of the carter constant ( so there is one less constant of motion available ) , and also due to the existence of additional spin - degrees of freedom .",
    "a newtonian order , weak - field estimation for the radiative change of the spin has been worked out by apostolatos _ et.al .",
    "some speculations of what could happen to circular orbits under strong field conditions can be found in @xcite,@xcite . for generic orbits ,",
    "most likely only a self - force calculation will be able to describe the full orbital evolution .",
    "as we are still far away from dealing with all of these challenges we make two major simplifications for this paper , that the orbiting particle has no spin and that it always remains in an equatorial orbit .",
    "although ryan has shown @xcite , for orbits in the weak field region , that non - equatorial orbits are forced by radiation reaction towards becoming retrograde equatorial orbits , the effect is small .",
    "the effect remains small even in the strong field region , as was recently shown by hughes @xcite .",
    "precisely equatorial orbits , pro- or retrograde , will remain equatorial under radiation reaction .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that detectors such as lisa will actually observe signals from particles in near equatorial orbits .",
    "previous studies have shown that slightly eccentric orbits of particles around schwarzschild @xcite and kerr black holes @xcite and arbitrarily eccentric orbits around schwarzschild black holes @xcite decrease in their eccentricity until shortly before the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) when a point is reached after which the eccentricity begins to increase .",
    "the present work comes as an additional piece to this series of papers .",
    "specifically , we consider equatorial eccentric orbits of particles around a kerr black hole and study their evolution under gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "this class of orbits is not exactly what we would expect in reality , but it is an important step towards a more realistic view of gravitational waves from this type of low - frequency source , because it includes two very important features which we know will be present in all or most sources , black hole spin and orbital eccentricity .",
    "our study is , in this respect , a useful companion piece to hughes discussion of non - equatorial ( but circular ) orbits @xcite .",
    "eccentric equatorial orbits were first investigated by shibata @xcite who calculated fluxes and waveforms , without , however , discussing the impact of radiation reaction on the orbital motion .",
    "our approach is similar to previous papers investigating eccentric orbits around non - spinning black holes @xcite , and nearly circular orbits around spinning black holes @xcite and the results are qualitatively similar to those of both papers . in addition , we compute gravitational waveforms produced by moderate / high eccentricity , strong - field orbits ( not discussed in shibata s study @xcite ) which we call `` zoom - whirl '' orbits .",
    "we find that these waveforms are a very characteristic , though complex , signal that might be important from an observational point of view for the planned lisa space antenna .",
    "in this paper we focus on the final part of the inspiral , when the particle is at small radii , relatively close to the last stable bound orbit .",
    "in consequence we deal with orbits with moderate eccentricities , between 0.1 and 0.7 . in a future paper @xcite",
    "we intend to study the full inspiral , thus expanding our scope to cover orbits with large radii and larger eccentricities , on the order of 1 . in that paper",
    "we plan to present wavetrains and spectra associated with a long stretch of the inspiral , covering many orbital periods , along the lines of @xcite .",
    "our results in this paper can be summarised as follows .",
    "moderate eccentricities will be a feature of the signals from many inspiralling compact binaries right up to the final plunge . immediately before plunge there will be an eccentricity increasing phase in all cases , particularly noticeable for retrograde orbits .",
    "the total amount of eccentricity gained in this phase will generally be small , on the order of 10% or less for low - eccentricity ( @xmath20 ) prograde orbits , but perhaps as much as 50% for low - eccentricity retrograde orbits .",
    "orbits with moderate eccentricities will gain much less in eccentricity .",
    "where @xmath21 and the orbit is prograde , zoom - whirl features will be prominent in the waveform in the very last stages of the inspiral . where these orbits are observed from a position away from the polar axis of the source there will relatively strong high - frequency component to the signal due to beaming of higher multipoles in the radiation in the direction of the orbiting particle s motion .",
    "one expects that these signals will present particular problems for signal analysis , a situation which may be ameliorated when a positive detection of the source has been made during the earlier part of the inspiral when the waveform , though highly eccentric , will be less complex .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "in part ii we discuss the geodesic motion of eccentric equatorial orbits ( sections iia & iib ) , paying particular attention to the so - called `` zoom - whirl '' orbits ( section iic ) .",
    "in those sections we define useful orbital parameters such as the semi - latus rectum @xmath0 and the eccentricity @xmath1 .",
    "some analytic approximations on the orbital periods and number of revolutions for a particle in an orbit close to becoming dynamically unstable , are presented in section iid .",
    "sections iiia & iiib of part iii contain a review of the teukolsky - sasaki - nakamura formalism for the calculation of gravitational waveforms and fluxes . in section iiic",
    ", we give a preliminary discussion on the orbital evolution under radiation reaction ( definition of adiabaticity , general formulae for the rate of change of orbital parameters ) .",
    "part iv is entirely devoted to analytic results .",
    "section iva discusses the weak - field limit for the orbital parameter s rates of change.in section ivb we derive an approximate formula relating the energy flux to the angular momentum flux , emitted by orbits close to becoming unstable .",
    "we subsequently use this formula to find strong - field approximate expressions for the rate of change of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in section",
    "ivc we study the particularly interesting family of ( equatorial ) horizon - skimming orbits that can exist around a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "the main ( numerical ) results of this paper are contained in part v. in section va , we sketch the methods used in our numerical code and , moreover , give estimates for the various introduced errors . in section",
    "vb we give results on the averaged rate of change of the parameters @xmath22 ( which determine the evolution of any given orbit ) .",
    "this allows us to draw conclusions for the `` global '' behaviour of bound equatorial orbits under the influence of radiation reaction .",
    "section vc contains calculations of waveforms generated from some zoom - whirl orbits .",
    "part v ends with a presentation of the spectral content of the radiation emitted at infinity and at the black hole horizon ( section vd ) .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in part vi , where we also discuss prospects for future work .",
    "tables with samples of our numerical data can be found at the end of the paper s main body .",
    "three appendices are devoted to some technical details . throughout this paper",
    "we have adopted geometrised units ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we start by considering a test body moving in a kerr gravitational field . for the moment , we neglect any radiation reaction effects and focus on purely geodesic motion . working in the usual boyer - lindquist coordinate frame ,",
    "the equations of motion , specialised for an equatorial orbit , are given by @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 the two constants of motion @xmath26 , @xmath27 denote the orbit s specific energy and @xmath28-component of angular momentum ( for notational simplicity we drop the subscript @xmath28 for the angular momentum ) .",
    "we have prograde ( retrograde ) orbits according to whether @xmath29 ( note that at certain points , where there is no danger of confusion , we shall label retrograde orbits by a negative value for the spin parameter @xmath30 ) .",
    "moreover , since we shall be discussing bound orbits , @xmath31 . a general bound equatorial orbit can be equivalently described @xcite either by the constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 or by a semi - latus rectum @xmath0 and an eccentricity @xmath1 ( with @xmath32 ) .",
    "the restriction on the values of @xmath0 is discussed below .",
    "we define these parameters in terms of the two turning points of the orbit ( @xmath33 is the periastron and @xmath34 the apastron , see fig .",
    "[ vr ] for a typical illustration ) , @xmath35 a turning point @xmath36 by definition satisfies @xmath37 , or explicitly , @xmath38 where we have further defined @xmath39 . writing this polynomial in the form @xmath40 we can immediately write an expression for the energy , @xmath41^{1/2 } \\;. \\label{energy}\\ ] ] similarly , the third root @xmath42 of ( [ turneq ] ) is found to be @xmath43 it then follows that , @xmath44 the explicit forms of the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given in appendix a. in this expression , the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to a prograde ( retrograde ) orbit .",
    "the same convention will be followed throughout the paper .",
    "the radial coordinate can be parameterised as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a monotonically varying parameter , running from @xmath49 ( at @xmath50 ) to @xmath51 ( at @xmath52 ) and finally up to @xmath53 ( back to @xmath54 ) .",
    "the radial motion can be separated into two distinct branches , namely , the motion from @xmath55 to @xmath34 , and the `` inverse '' motion from @xmath34 back to @xmath55 again . integration of ( [ eom3 ] ) gives @xmath56 where @xmath57dr   \\label{teq2}\\ ] ] we have also denoted as @xmath58 the period of the radial motion . for the @xmath59-motion we similarly write , @xmath60 where @xmath61dr \\;. \\label{phieq1}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 is the change of @xmath59 during an interval @xmath58 . both integrands in ( [ teq1 ] ) , ( [ pheq1 ] ) are ( unphysically ) divergent at the turning points , an undesirable feature in a numerical calculation .",
    "this difficulty can be avoided by choosing @xmath48 as the integration parameter . using @xmath63^{1/2 }   \\;,\\ ] ] we get @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 the integrand quantities in ( [ phichi ] ) , ( [ tchi ] ) are well behaved and , moreover , these equations are valid for both branches of the radial motion .",
    "the radial period is simply given by @xmath67 , and similarly , @xmath68 .",
    "a general bound equatorial orbit is the combination of two separable motions : the radial motion which is , strictly speaking , periodic ( in the sense that the radial coordinate returns to its original value after a certain time interval @xmath58 has elapsed ) and the azimuthal motion which is not purely periodic ( in the sense that the @xmath59-coordinate monotonically increases but , nevertheless , the orbit returns to the same configuration after @xmath59 has increased by some value @xmath69 ) .",
    "the former motion is known in classical mechanics @xcite as `` libration '' while the latter motion is called `` rotation '' .",
    "for such a combination of motions , it is generally known that there is a fundamental period ( the period of libration ) which fully describes the motion ( see appendix b for further details ) .",
    "we shall , therefore , call @xmath58 the _ orbital period_. the fact that the orbit is periodic in a strict sense will enable us to rigorously define adiabaticity when radiative effects are to be included .    in line with the foregoing discussion , we define the _ orbital frequency _ to be @xmath70",
    ". we can similarly refer to the frequency of the @xmath59-motion as @xmath71 .",
    "the gravitational waves emitted by our systems will have frequencies which depend on these orbital frequencies .",
    "below we shall see how they form a spectrum of discrete frequencies parameterised by the following wave numbers : @xmath72 , which identifies the multipole of the emitted waves ( @xmath73 for quadrupole , for instance ) , @xmath74 which runs from @xmath75 to @xmath76 and @xmath77 which counts the harmonics created by the linear composition of the two orbital frequencies .",
    "the frequency of the waves emitted by a given harmonic @xmath77 of a given multipolar contribution @xmath74 is    @xmath78    in the calculational scheme to be outlined below we will evaluate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum which are carried by waves of a given frequency ( that is , a given multipole and harmonic of the frequency spectrum ) and sum the fluxes for all frequencies of the discreet spectrum to get the total radiated fluxes of these quantities .      in general eqn .",
    "( [ turneq ] ) has three distinct real roots .",
    "the case with @xmath79 corresponds to a marginally stable orbit : once at the periastron , the particle will enter into a circular orbit of radius @xmath80 ( isbo stands for innermost stable bound orbit ) . at this stage",
    "the orbit has become unstable , so that a slight inwards `` push '' will drive the particle to catastrophically plunge into the black hole . therefore , stable bound orbits should satisfy @xmath81 .",
    "this translates to the inequality , @xmath82 we can imagine a division of the @xmath83 plane into regions of stable and unstable orbits .",
    "the boundary curve @xmath84 satisfying the equality in ( [ sepax ] ) , defines the separatrix of bound orbits . in fig .",
    "[ sepx ] we illustrate separatrices for a variety of black hole spins .",
    "a sample of numerical data used to generate this figure can be found in table  [ tab_sepax ] .",
    "as one might have anticipated , spinning up the black hole will cause the separatrix curve for prograde ( retrograde ) orbits to move to the left ( right ) with respect to the schwarzschild curve @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "this behaviour can be seen most easily by a slow rotation approximation to ( [ sepax ] ) . at leading order",
    "we find , @xmath86^{1/2 } + { \\cal o}(a^2 ) \\;. \\label{slowsepax}\\ ] ] on the other hand , as can be verified by direct substitution in ( [ sepax ] ) , for extreme rotation ( @xmath87 ) the prograde separatrix becomes @xmath88 , i.e. for all eccentricities , the periastron `` descends '' into the black hole `` throat '' at @xmath89 , but is still separated by a finite proper distance from the horizon itself @xcite .",
    "from the short discussion in the previous section one can imagine that as the orbit gradually approaches the separatrix , the particle will spend a considerable amount of its orbital `` life '' close to the periastron ( see fig .",
    "[ zoom ] ) .",
    "an approximation for @xmath90 as @xmath91 , derived in the following section , gives @xmath92 which shows that the period will grow ( and eventually diverge ) as the separatrix is approached . in that region ,",
    "the particle will trace a quasi - circular path before being reflected back to the apastron .",
    "such behaviour will be particularly prominent for high eccentricity orbits : the particle will `` zoom in '' from its apastron position , and perform a certain number of quasi - circular revolutions ( `` whirls '' ) reaching the periastron ( which should have a value close to @xmath93 ) .",
    "finally , the particle will be reflected and `` zoom out '' towards the apastron again",
    ". we shall heuristically ( but quite descriptively ) name these orbits `` zoom - whirl '' orbits .",
    "they resemble a set of orbits known in the literature as homoclinic orbits @xcite .",
    "zoom - whirl orbits can exist in both kerr and schwarzschild geometries , and their potential significance for the detection of gravitational waves by space - based instruments was first pointed out some years ago by curt cutler and eric poisson , who concluded that the small number of whirls in the schwarzschild case made the phenomenon less interesting for spinless central bodies .",
    "but as we shall shortly see , they are more pronounced in the case of near - extreme kerr black holes , for prograde orbits .",
    "a typical example of such an orbit is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ zoom ] , for the case of a rapidly spinning ( @xmath94 ) black hole .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the total number of azimuthal revolutions @xmath95 during one orbital period , by numerically integrating ( [ phichi ] ) .",
    "results obtained by such a calculation are presented in fig .",
    "[ revol ] . in this figure",
    "we have considered orbits of a given eccentricity ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) and for a variety of black hole spins .",
    "for all depicted cases , the smallest value of @xmath0 resides at the same distance @xmath98 from the corresponding separatrix value @xmath99 .",
    "as can be seen , the number of revolutions increases as the separatrix is approached , in agreement with our intuitive expectations .",
    "in fact , an approximate formula ( valid for @xmath100 ) derived in section iid shows that , @xmath101 we can furthermore deduce that the `` whirling '' of the particle near the separatrix becomes more pronounced as the black hole spin increases .",
    "although for small and moderate spins @xmath102 stays close to the corresponding schwarzschild value , it grows rapidly as @xmath103 , basically due to the intense `` frame - dragging '' induced by the black hole s rotation in the very strong field region close to the horizon which can be reached by particles in prograde orbits .",
    "the overall behaviour can be understood as an extreme example of perihelion advance ( as in the celebrated case of the planet mercury ) .    in principle , as ( [ nrev1 ] ) suggests , the number of revolutions can be made arbitrarily large irrespective of the black hole spin , provided the particle approaches the separatrix sufficiently closely . however , as we discuss in section iiic the adiabatic assumption upon which our formalism relies breaks down in this regime .",
    "sufficiently close to the separatrix , radiation reaction makes a significant correction to the particle s motion in each orbital period . before long this causes the particle to cross the separatrix and plunge into the black hole .",
    "these transition / plunging regimes have been studied recently by ori and thorne @xcite for the case of circular equatorial orbits in the kerr geometry .",
    "more relevant to the present discussion is the work of oshaughnessy and thorne @xcite which concerns the transition regime of zoom - whirl orbits .",
    "they show that for the case of an extreme kerr black hole and eccentricity close to unity , the particle may experience more than 20 whirls per orbit before plunging .",
    "these have to be added to the number of whirls performed during the adiabatic phase of the orbit .    in a realistic scenario",
    ", we should not expect to find ( apart from chance cases where the particle enters a near - separatrix orbit as a result of its initial scattering ) very high eccentricity zoom - whirl orbits , as it is well known that the orbit has a general tendency to circularise @xcite .",
    "however , despite the decrease in eccentricity over the greater part of the inspiral , a substantial amount of eccentricity will survive , in many cases , up to the point where the orbit is about to plunge .",
    "these orbits will probably become zoom - whirl orbits , especially when a rapidly spinning black hole is involved and especially for prograde orbits . keep in mind that many scattered particles will be in highly non - equatorial orbits .",
    "zoom - whirl behaviour should also be seen in these cases as there is still a separatrix present , close to which the particle can spend a considerable amount of time .",
    "a compact body in a zoom - whirl orbit will spend a considerable fraction of the orbital period in strong field regions ( it can even travel close to the event horizon if the central black hole is spinning rapidly enough ) and hence will radiate strongly . our numerical results together with analytic approximations",
    ", reveal that a good fraction of the averaged flux is radiated during the motion near the periastron . as the orbit approaches the separatrix it tends to radiate as if it was a circular orbit of angular frequency @xmath104 ( see also @xcite for a similar statement in the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "this is clear evidence that most of the radiation is coming from the whirl part of the orbit , during which the radius hardly changes and there is a single dominant frequency characterised by the azimuthal ( @xmath59-dependent ) orbital period .",
    "however , the most important feature of a zoom - whirl orbit is the characteristic form of the gravitational wave it emits , which is a series of rapid `` quasi - circular '' oscillations separated by relatively `` quiet '' intervals . in section",
    "vc below we calculate some waveforms of this type .",
    "orbits that reside near the separatrix of the @xmath83 plane are amenable to analytic approximation , basically due to the fact that the turning point @xmath55 is close to a local minimum of the radial potential @xmath105 . in this section",
    "we derive approximate expressions for @xmath90 and @xmath62 .",
    "we already know that ( see eqn .",
    "( [ tchi ] ) ) , @xmath106 we take the `` distance '' @xmath107 from the separatrix to be small , i.e. @xmath108 .",
    "also , we shall exclude small eccentricity orbits ( more precisely , orbits with @xmath109 ) , or marginally bound orbits ( @xmath110 ) . the former case of nearly circular orbits has already been discussed in @xcite . in",

    "the outgoing reflected waves `` push '' the particle outwards , and this interaction is manifested as a gain of orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "our result can be easily understood if we recall that the ergoregion is growing for increasing black hole spin . at the same time , because the boundary of instability moves in to lower radii with increasing spin , a particle can enter regions with much stronger fields and therefore emit a substantial amount of radiation towards the ergoregion ( see fig .

    "hence , the maximum ( negative ) value is attained exactly at the separatrix . the approximate expression ( [ epratio ] ) for @xmath423 is expected to be very accurate there .",
    "we can use this fixed gradient and extrapolate out to the critical curve , at some eccentricity @xmath424 , for a given eccentricity @xmath425 at the separatrix .",
    "then we have that @xmath426 .",
    "this number should set an _",
    "upper _ limit of the total increase in eccentricity .",
    "results for some representative cases are given in table  [ tabgain ] . from these numbers",
    "we deduce that , at best , there is a fractional increase of 5 - 50 % in eccentricity , the most favourable case being low - eccentricity retrograde orbits around rapidly spinning black holes .",
    "this gain decreases as we move upwards to larger final eccentricities ( basically due to the shrinkage of the @xmath404 region ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that we should not expect any dramatic increase in eccentricity when the orbit is about to become unstable .",
    "a crude estimate on the number of orbits can be made by integrating ( [ pdot4 ] ) to find the time required to cross the @xmath412 region , @xmath427 where we have factored out the angular momentum flux as it can be taken as constant within the integration interval ( and recovered by our numerical data ) .",
    "similarly we have assumed a fixed eccentricity . the number of orbits is then calculated by dividing @xmath428 with a typical period @xmath58 ( or @xmath429 ) .",
    "we give some representative results in table  [ tabnorb ] .",
    "we need to emphasise that these numbers should be viewed only as order - of - magnitude estimates , as eqn .",
    "( [ tcross ] ) is a rough approximation .",
    "nevertheless , we can still draw some reliable conclusions . for a small eccentricity our numbers are in agreement with existing results for nearly circular orbits around a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "for @xmath430 we should typically have a few thousands revolutions in the @xmath404 region around a @xmath94 hole and for a mass ratio @xmath298 .",
    "for the same parameters , but for retrograde orbits , there is an order of magnitude increase in the number of orbits . on the other hand , for all cases , there is an order of magnitude ( or more ) decrease as we move to eccentricity @xmath431 .",
    "note that it is possible to have a small number of full orbits , but yet a significant number of azimuthal revolutions or `` whirls '' ( see for example the @xmath432 case in table  [ tabnorb ] ) .",
    "let us now focus on the class of orbits we have named zoom - whirl .",
    "as we have shown , orbits located near the separatrix should radiate in accordance with ( [ circflux ] ) , as though they were nearly circular . in table",
    "[ tab3z ] we list numerical fluxes for zoom - whirl orbits of various eccentricities .",
    "it is clear from these results that as the separatrix is approached , the analytic prediction ( [ circflux ] ) is indeed confirmed .",
    "however , one has to be very cautious when applying ( [ circflux ] ) to the study of a real astrophysical , extreme mass ratio , binary system .",
    "as our data reveal , in the region where this relation is fractionally accurate at the level of @xmath433 , the adiabaticity constraint ( [ adiab ] ) on the mass ratio is quite severe , typically @xmath434 .",
    "the zoom - whirl orbits are of interest for future detection efforts because of the characteristic waveform they generate . in figs .",
    "[ wfs1 ] to [ wfs3 ] we show such waveforms ( in particular we plot the quantity @xmath435 as a function of retarded time @xmath436 ) for a couple of strong - field zoom - whirl orbits ( @xmath437 and @xmath438 , @xmath439 and @xmath440 ) and for a rapidly spinning black hole with @xmath94 .",
    "both orbits would evolve adiabatically if we consider a typical mass ratio @xmath441 .",
    "the corresponding gravitational wave flux data can be found in table  [ tab_num ] .",
    "first we shall discuss the waveform as seen by an observer located on the black hole s equatorial plane , see fig .  [ wfs1 ] and top panel of fig .",
    "[ wfs3 ] . clearly , these waveforms have a very distinct appearance . a rapidly oscillating , high amplitude signal is radiated during the whirling of the particle near periastron . in between these bursts",
    "one observes low - amplitude signals produced during the particle s zoom in and out from apastron .",
    "this contrast in amplitudes is greatest for larger eccentricities ( compare fig .",
    "[ wfs1 ] and fig .",
    "[ wfs3 ] ) . an interesting feature of the equatorial waveform is the prominent high frequency ripples superimposed on the waveforms , associated with the higher multipoles components ( @xmath442 and higher .",
    "the illustrated waveform includes all multipoles up to @xmath443 ) of the wave .",
    "it is noteworthy that the high frequency features are prominent in both the zoom and the whirl parts of the orbit , although if they are solely the result of beaming we might expect that they would be purely a whirl feature , as the motion is fastest near periastron .",
    "however preliminary results from a time domain code written by one of us ( kg ) suggest that the high frequency features may be associated with quasi - normal modes of the black hole , which are excited by the high frequency emissions from the orbit . the quasi - normal mode ringing results in a continuous and time - delayed emission at these frequencies",
    ".    we also show waveforms seen by an observer on the polar axis of the black hole , in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ wfs2 ] and the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ wfs3 ] . in this case both `` plus '' and `` cross '' polarisations are present ( only @xmath140 is nonzero for an equatorial observer ) but we illustrate only @xmath140 because the `` cross '' waveform is the same except for a phase lag .",
    "the polar waveforms have the characteristic features of a high - amplitude , multi - cycle whirl part and a low - amplitude two cycle zoom part , but the high frequency features are absent .",
    "this suggests that the high frequency features are associated with beaming due to the rapid motion of the particle in the equatorial plane in the very strong field region , although the high - frequency features are not associated only with the strongest - field whirl part but are distributed throughout the whole cycle , including the weaker field ( larger radius ) zoom part .",
    "the polar waveforms are completely dominated by the quadrupole ( @xmath73 ) emission .",
    "the @xmath442 and higher multipoles do not contribute significantly . in the equatorial waveforms",
    "the quadrupolar contribution is not much greater than that of the @xmath442 multipole and the fall off , in terms of the amplitude of @xmath140 , for each subsequent multipolar waveform is slow .",
    "the transition between the polar and equatorial waveforms can by understood by looking at the waveform depicted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ wfs2 ] which corresponds to observation at angle @xmath444 .",
    "one can get an idea of what is going on by looking at the @xmath186-dependence of the energy flux from the system . in fig .",
    "[ antenfig ] one sees that the @xmath445 flux ( dominated by the @xmath446 contribution ) is concentrated somewhat towards the pole ( @xmath447 ) , but there is a strong shift towards the equator ( @xmath448 ) in the @xmath449 flux , and further concentrations in that direction for each successively higher value of @xmath74 .",
    "therefore one sees the sort of beaming of the higher multipoles observed in the waveforms , although because of the dominance of the quadrupole the amplitude of the polar and equatorial waveforms is similar in this case .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ wfs4 ] , we show the waveform from the retrograde zoom - whirl orbit @xmath450 , retaining @xmath451 for the black hole spin . the familiar zoom - whirling pattern is clear also in this case .",
    "however , we do not see any prominent high - frequency structure in these waveforms as the contribution coming from higher multipoles is small ( because the orbit does not reside in a very strong field regime ) .",
    "we are not surprised , in this case , that the waveform seen when observing from a point along the hole s polar axis ( see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ wfs4 ] ) is not very different .",
    "although these zoom - whirl waveforms appear rather complex , and could present a problem for matched filtering data analysis techniques , one can take comfort in the fact that the number of harmonics of the spectrum which contribute significantly to the waveform and overall flux is not that great .",
    "scott hughes @xcite has suggested that analysing individual `` voices , '' which are monochromatic , of a complex wave may be an effective way to proceed in data analysis .",
    "take the case of the zoom - whirl orbit with @xmath437 , @xmath452 and @xmath453 . if we look at fig .",
    "[ spec_full ] , which shows the entire spectrum ( up to @xmath443 ) of this signal , we see that the number of individual harmonics , or voices , each corresponding to an instance of the three numbers @xmath72,@xmath74 and @xmath77 , which stand out are on the order of a dozen .",
    "each of these voices has a rather simple waveform , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ voicefig ] .",
    "it is only their superposition which is complicated . therefore following the chirp of individual voices",
    "as the orbit evolves may not be such a formidable computational task .",
    "= 6.5 cm    = 6.5 cm      the final part of our numerical results concerns the harmonic decomposition of the gravitational radiation fluxes .",
    "specifically , we examine the @xmath77 distribution of the energy flux , at infinity and at the horizon , for a given multipole channel @xmath454 ( the angular momentum flux spectrum exhibits a similar behaviour ) . in all the figures in this section ,",
    "expect fig .",
    "[ spec_full ] , we plot @xmath455 versus @xmath77 .    to begin with , in fig .",
    "[ spece07_if ] we present the energy flux spectrum , at infinity , of the @xmath456 multipoles for an orbit with parameters @xmath457 , and for spin @xmath94 .",
    "as we have already mentioned , for such a strong - field orbit the higher multipoles give significant contributions to the total flux .",
    "the spectrum itself is composed of a series of `` humps '' which grow in height as @xmath77 increases , up to the point where the maximum harmonic is reached at @xmath458 , after which the spectrum rapidly fades away .",
    "this behaviour closely resembles the one found in the schwarzschild case @xcite , although in the present case the `` humps '' show a somewhat less regular structure . as we are not dealing with a very high eccentricity orbit",
    ", we find that @xmath459 is not very large .",
    "moreover , the spectrum peak shifts to higher @xmath77 values as @xmath72 increases .    in fig .",
    "[ spece07_h ] we graph the corresponding horizon fluxes for the same orbit and same multipoles as in fig .  [ spece07_if ] .",
    "both infinity and horizon fluxes peak at a common @xmath459 value .",
    "since the selected orbit resides in a strong field regime , the horizon flux is a respectable fraction ( @xmath460 ) of the flux at infinity , and moreover , is predominantly negative i.e. superradiant , as we should expect from the discussion in the previous section .",
    "note that the relative contribution of the quadrupole channel is much larger in the case of horizon fluxes as compared to the infinity fluxes .    the full energy flux spectrum , up to @xmath443 , for the @xmath461,@xmath462 orbit is shown in fig .  [ spec_full ] in terms of frequency rather that @xmath77",
    ".    spectra belonging to retrograde orbits appear similar to the prograde spectra with the difference that they peak at negative values of @xmath77 . for a typical situation",
    "see fig .",
    "[ spectretro ] for the retrograde orbit of @xmath463 and black hole spin @xmath94 .    before closing this section",
    ", we should point out that only the harmonics around @xmath459 ( typically 10 - 30 of them ) give a significant contribution to the total flux , for given @xmath454 .",
    "this statement applies for all eccentricities we examined , and could have an important impact on the computation of waveforms and fluxes from highly eccentric orbits in which case @xmath459 attains very large values .",
    "for example , if one could find by other means ( for example a time - domain code , see discussion in the next section ) the location of the main peak , then the calculation of the surrounding harmonics should give an sufficiently accurate result for the flux .",
    "this strategy is far more economic , from a computational point of view , than calculating all the harmonics between @xmath464 and @xmath459 .",
    "= 5.5 cm    = 5.5 cm",
    "we have examined gravitational waves from and radiation reaction of equatorial orbits of particles in the last stages of inspiral around a central black hole .",
    "we expect that such orbits will often have moderate eccentricities , not circular but significantly less than @xmath465 .",
    "as these orbits approach the point at which they will plunge into the black hole two things will happen .",
    "the first is that the orbital eccentricity will begin to increase , having been decreasing throughout the preceding inspiral . for retrograde orbits this eccentricity increasing phase will last for many cycles , while for prograde orbits , especially ones which retain fairly high eccentricities",
    ", this phase will be fairly brief ( in the case of rapidly rotating black holes ) .",
    "we have found a @xmath466 fractional increase in eccentricity , for the most favourable situations .",
    "secondly , as the orbit draws closer to the unstable region it will tend to spend a longer and longer portion of each orbital period near periastron .",
    "for reasonably eccentric orbits this will promote the `` zoom - whirl '' behaviour we have described , with its characteristic waveform . although extreme cases involving high eccentricities will presumably be rare , it is still likely that lisa will be seeing signals with @xmath467 whirls , and therefore @xmath468 gravitational wave cycles between each apastron",
    ". therefore templates of such signals will be very important .",
    "it is worth noting that because the orbital radius changes very little during these whirls , the whirl part of the waveform looks , in many respects , like a near circular waveform with harmonics of a single dominant frequency .",
    "this means , for instance , that for orbits with many whirls , the ratio of the fluxes of energy and angular momentum is close to @xmath469 ( recall the celebrated relation for circular orbits @xmath470 ) .",
    "considering inclined orbits ( not confined to the equatorial plane ) for a moment , we expect that zoom - whirl orbits will be found in cases with small inclination angles , because higher inclination angles feature greater plunge radii and the particle can not ever have a very small periastron radius ( as we see when the orbit is retrograde , which corresponds to the largest possible inclination angle ) .",
    "when the test - particle is in an inclined and eccentric orbit , close to crossing some separatrix of bound stable orbits , it will spend a considerable amount of time moving in a quasi - circular non - equatorial trajectory close to the periastron .",
    "it is plausible , by extrapolating the results of the present work , that during the `` whirling '' stage , the orbital energy , angular momentum and carter constant will approximately evolve in such a way as if the orbit was circular and inclined . assuming",
    "that most of the radiated energy , angular momentum and carter constant are generated near the periastron ( which in the present case is located in a strong field regime ) then one might be able to estimate the , otherwise elusive , rate of change of the carter constant for a near - to - plunge generic kerr orbit .",
    "such information could provide a very useful test for the recently adopted assumption of obtaining the rate of change of the carter constant by keeping the orbital inclination angle fixed during the inspiral @xcite .",
    "waveforms from prograde orbits residing close to the horizon of the black hole will feature significant high frequency components when seen from a position on the equatorial plane of the system ( i.e. when the orbit is observed `` edge on '' ) .",
    "this seems to be due to beaming , resulting from the rapid motion of the orbiting particle along the line of sight of the observer . when observed from on or near the polar axis",
    "the waveform is largely quadrupolar , dominated by a single nearly circular frequency .",
    "a glance at the equatorial zoom - whirl waveforms presented here suggests that they can be very complex and not necessarily amenable to matched filtering methods following the full wavetrain . but recall that a successful source identification may already have been made during the previous year of observation by lisa and from the source parameters deduced during this period it may be possible to search for the whirl parts of the waveform individually . on the other hand , it is worth noting that this high frequency structure could make it possible for lisa to detect late inspiral signals from very large black holes , with masses above @xmath471 , which would otherwise be too low frequency ( in the low multipole parts of the waveform ) for detection .",
    "by contrast , if we are looking down on the system from the pole then the signal is much `` cleaner '' , without much contribution beyond the @xmath446 multipole .",
    "obviously non - equatorial motion will introduce further harmonics and , as suggested in @xcite it may prove more useful to examine different harmonics or `` voices '' of the signal separately , rather than trying to model the entire complex signal as one template .",
    "it has been recently realised @xcite that orbits during the long inspiral phase , before the radial orbital frequency is within the lisa waveband , will , in principle , emit detectable radiation .",
    "recall that the periastron is rather close , @xmath472 , so that the frequency of the cycles in the whirl part of the waveform _ does _ fall within the lisa waveband . as the time between successive bursts ( equal to the radial orbital period ) will be very long ( typically up to a century or even more ) these bursts would not be expected to be detectable in practice .",
    "however , as the number of objects in this long inspiral stage will be rather great , one does have to take them into account as a background noise which will tend to hinder lisa s efforts to detect signals from those objects in the last stages of their inspiral .",
    "in fact , one could in principle expect to have proper zoom - whirl orbits even at this stage , provided the central hole is rapidly spinning and the orbit is retrograde",
    ". then , as we have shown , the corresponding separatrix translates to a minimum periastron value , @xmath473 , which falls within the expected periastron distribution .    in a follow - up paper @xcite we will study orbits with larger radii and larger eccentricities .",
    "in particular we are planning to produce ( using the method of @xcite which was applied for inspiralling circular inclined orbits ) the full inspiral trajectory and the resulting waveform for bound equatorial orbits that could be of importance for lisa .",
    "it is of great interest to ( a ) produce full inspiral waveforms for the kind of orbits described above and ( b ) give a good estimate of the total inspiral time , and the residual eccentricity ( taking under consideration effects like the sign reversal of @xmath326 ) just before plunging .",
    "however , the calculation of fluxes and waveforms produced by bodies in @xmath336 orbits , is currently ranked as a difficult task . when pursued in the frequency domain ( as it was the case in the present work )",
    "one has to calculate an enormous number of individual harmonics , as it is obvious from the spectra we presented .",
    "moreover , the numerical computation of the integrals ( [ zlmk4 ] ) is poorly convergent , a manifestation of the fact that the source term in the teukolsky equation ( [ radteuk ] ) diverges as @xmath225 ( that is , when the orbit tends to become parabolic @xmath110 ) .",
    "one way to cure this pathology would be to work with the inhomogeneous sasaki - nakamura equation @xcite which has a well behaved source term ( in the sense that it decays at spatial infinity ) .",
    "however , the first difficulty outlined above will still be present . a possible way to overcome",
    "it could be the calculation of the waveform / fluxes directly in the time domain by evolving the time - dependent teukolsky equation without resorting to any separation of variables apart from @xmath59 .",
    "conceivably , the required numerical code could be based on the teukolsky codes used to study the dynamics of scalar and gravitational perturbations in a kerr background metric @xcite , see @xcite for a report on such an attempt .",
    "looking further ahead , such time - domain codes could be the only practical tool for computing the waveform / fluxes generated by bodies orbiting non - black hole massive compact objects ( in which case there is no known teukolsky - like separable wave equation ) .",
