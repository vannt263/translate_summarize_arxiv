    ", it can be shown that the vertices @xmath179 and @xmath180 must occur an even number of times ( @xmath185 is even ) , which is sufficient to ensure that the overall contribution to the weight function in the _ diagonal sector _ is positive definite .",

    "however , since the partition function is still defined in the diagonal sector , the total weight in the off - diagonal sector can be obtained by working with the absolute weights while keeping track of the overall sign of the vertex weights .",
    "observables such as the green s function are then calculated as the signed average over configurations . in short , measurements in the off - diagonal sector",
    "are easily obtained by using the absolute value of all off - diagonal vertex weights , while separately keeping track of the overall sign of the operator string as it evolves during the loop update .",
    "we find this method to be much simpler in practice than the standard alternative : first define a formal ( sub)lattice transformation such that all off - diagonal terms become negative definite , then determine the momentum shift required to map between the original and transformed hamiltonian observables . for the xxz model in a longitudinal field , this becomes a sublattice rotation of @xmath187 around the @xmath24 axis , with a @xmath188 momentum shift . in the present case , an additional lattice rotation by @xmath155 is required whenever @xmath14 , which becomes tedious to keep track of compared to the relative simplicity of our explicit sign - tracking described above .",
    "another benefit to our method of sign tracking is that if the overall sign is ever negative at the close of the loop update , then we know that the model has a qmc sign problem .",
    "thus , we have explicitly checked our assumption that no sign problem exists for the tf - xxz model as defined in this paper .",
    "let us begin by writing the unperturbed hamiltonian as @xmath189 so that the perturbed hamiltonian becomes @xmath190 next , we consider the zeroth - order ( unperturbed ) contribution to the energy of a state with all and all - but - one of its spins aligned with the magnetic field , and label these energies @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath193 the first - order corrections can be obtained as @xmath194 , and are given by @xmath195 finally , by equating these energies up to first order ( i.e. @xmath196 ) we find an estimate of the critical field , where the fully saturated unperturbed state is favorable to the state with a flipped spin : @xmath197 ."

    "<S> this indicates the fluctuations around the qcp and demonstrate the inability of mean field swt to describe the physics precisely . </S>",
    "<S> that is why , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ms ] , the magnetization plots around @xmath90 show some unphysical turning , already witnessed for an ising afm ( see ref .  ) . as the heisenberg point has @xmath84 , @xmath77 remains zero there and a linear swt remains a good theory . </S>",
    "<S> but away from @xmath23 , @xmath77 starts getting bigger with larger spin anisotropy making mean field swt estimates more inappropriate at @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> so the phase boundaries obtained using linear swt differs more from qmc estimates in fig.[fig - phase ] for @xmath97 further away from unity . </S>",
    "<S> see that the unphysical behavior in @xmath26 for @xmath98 also gets pronounced mostly away from @xmath23 ( compare fig.[ms](a),(d ) results with that of fig.[ms](b),(c ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a linear swt ( @xmath99 swt@xmath71 and swt@xmath80 ) , thus , can not predict an accurate phase boundary , as compared to the qmc calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however , we notice that a second order correction to linear swt ( see supplementary ) improves the result and also give phase boundaries close to the qmc predictions ( see swt@xmath100 results in fig.[fig - phase](a ) ) . a perturbation analysis ( see supplementary ) at the cross - over point between full polarization and the one with all but one spin flipped also describes the transitions better and give phase boundaries close to that obtained by qmc .    </S>",
    "<S> _ quantum monte carlo._the typical way of dealing with transverse fields within the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) formalism , or qmc more generically , has been to treat them as adding individual raising and lowering operators to the xxz hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this method has been successful in describing ferromagnetic systems , and details of this typical implementation of transverse fields can be found in refs .   and  . however , this approach is not suitable for antiferromagnetic models , as the off - diagonal nature of the transverse field complicates the sublattice rotation necessary to transform the hamiltonian into a sign - problem - free form .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we take an alternative approach by choosing the direction of the applied magnetic field as the projection axis for spin quantum number so that the magnetic field acts upon the spins via diagonal operators . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for the tf - xxz model is given by @xmath101 choosing the @xmath11 axis as our spin quantization axis , we rewrite the above hamiltonian in terms of the ladder operators @xmath102 to find @xmath103 this hamiltonian can be shown to be free of the qmc `` sign problem '' for bipartite lattices by choosing an appropriate ( sub)lattice rotation , or by keeping track of the overall sign of the vertex weights in the operator string  for more details , see the appendix .    in order to accommodate planar anisotropy , additional vertices need to be included compared to the standard ones required for axially anisotropic hamiltonians . </S>",
