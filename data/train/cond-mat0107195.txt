    "in 1959 , schlier and farnsworth reported their low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) experiments on the surface of si ( 111 ) @xcite .",
    "after heating the surface to 900@xmath1c , they discovered that the surface displays additional scattering peaks in the leed pattern .",
    "these additional peaks were caused by a reconstruction of the si surface where the new unit cell is 7@xmath27 as large as the bulk terminated structure .",
    "silicon condenses in the diamond structure with a cubic lattice constant of @xmath3 at @xmath4k and @xmath5 at @xmath6k @xcite .",
    "the unit vectors of the bulk terminated si ( 111 ) surface have a length of @xmath7 and an angle of 60@xmath1 , in the reconstructed surface , the unit vectors have a length of @xmath8 @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "the reconstruction not only affects the surface atom layer , but the topmost four layers , and the new unit cell contains approximately 200 atoms . because of this remarkable size of the unit cell , the determination of the atom positions has been a tremendous challenge for surface scientists for more than two decades . the determination of the positions of the surface atoms by binnig _ et al . _ with a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) in 1982 @xcite was instrumental for the discovery of all the atomic positions within the surface unit cell . in 1985 , the now commonly adapted dimer - adatom - stacking - fault model ( das ) was finally suggested by takayanagi _",
    "_ @xcite . according to this model",
    "( see fig .",
    "1 ) , six adatoms are situated in each half of the unit cell .",
    "the adatoms are bound by covalent bonds formed by @xmath10 hybrid orbitals . in the bulk ,",
    "the hybrid orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and form an electron pair . at the surface , one of the four @xmath10 hybrid orbitals is pointing perpendicular to the surface and forms a dangling bond .",
    "because of its historic role in the establishment of the stm , the si ( 111)-(7@xmath27 ) surface has been considered as a touchstone for the feasibility of the atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite as a tool for surface science . however , because of the reactivity of si ( 111)-(7@xmath27 ) , afm experiments have proven to be difficult in the quasistatic afm mode , and chemical bonding between tip and sample has hampered atomic resolution @xcite . in 1994 ,",
    "si ( 111)-(7@xmath27 ) was imaged by afm for the first time @xcite .",
    "afm is now becoming an increasingly powerful tool for surface science , as true atomic resolution is achieved routinely @xcite .",
    "surfaces are imaged with atomic resolution by bringing a probe into close proximity and sensing the interaction while scanning the surface .",
    "it has been shown that a dynamic mode of imaging is required for resolving reactive surfaces like si ( 111 ) in ultra - high vacuum where chemical bonding between tip and sample can occur @xcite .",
    "frequency - modulation afm ( fm - afm ) @xcite has proven to be a practical method for fast imaging in vacuum and is now the commonly used technique .",
    "recently , it was proposed @xcite that the noise decreases by a factor of approximately 10 by optimizing the stiffness of the cantilever and the oscillation amplitude ( see section [ experimental ] ) .",
    "consequently , unprecedented resolution has been achieved with these operating parameters .",
    "especially , deviations from the so far hemispherical apparent shape of the individual atoms have been observed , and these deviations have been attributed to the symmetry of the chemical bonds between tip and sample .    the first afm images of si ( 111)-(7@xmath27 ) @xcite looked similar to the stm images of the empty states .",
    "the bond between the front atom of the tip and the dangling bond on top of the adatoms is thought to be responsible for the experimentally observed atomic contrast in the fm - afm images @xcite . while the atom in the center of the cornerholes is @xmath11 below the adatoms surrounding the cornerhole @xcite , in typical stm experiments a depth of @xmath12 is observed .",
    "the discrepancy between the nominal depth of the cornerholes and the stm data is probably caused by the finite tip radius of the stm tips .",
    "the tip is not sharp enough to allow a penetration of the front atom all the way to the bottom of the cornerhole . in the first afm experiment ,",
    "the observed depth of the cornerhole was only @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this even smaller depth is probably due to a significant contribution of long - range forces .",
    "it is shown here , that the contribution of long - range forces is reduced by operating the microscope with very small oscillation amplitudes and a cornerhole depth of @xmath14 is obtained .    in the present work",
    ", the si(111)-(7@xmath27 ) surface is investigated using fm - afm with optimised resolution .",
    "the structure of the si(111)-(7@xmath07 ) surface is known very well through a large number of experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "because of its pronounced features , such as the deep cornerholes and the widely spaced adatoms with a well defined bonding characteristic , the si(111)-(7@xmath07 ) surface is a perfect sample for studying the atomic and subatomic structure of the tip .",
    "the spatial resolution of the afm has advanced sufficiently such that clear deviations of an @xmath15- or @xmath16- type tip have been observed @xcite .",
    "therefore , in contrast to previous studies , tip and sample switch roles now and the well defined surface is used to probe the tip , where much less information about its structure and composition is available .",
    "the data was taken with a modified commercial scanning tunneling microscope @xcite which has been outfitted with a force sensor based on a quartz tuning fork ( qplus - sensor , @xcite ) .",
    "the tip of the force sensor is either an etched tungsten tip such as known from stm or a silicon crystallite . in fm - afm , a cantilever beam holding a sharp tip with an eigenfrequency @xmath17 , spring constant @xmath18 and quality factor @xmath19 is subject to controlled positive feedback such that it oscillates with a constant amplitude @xmath20 . when this cantilever is brought close to a sample , its frequency changes from @xmath17 to @xmath21 .",
    "this frequency change @xmath22 is used to create an image @xmath23 by scanning the cantilever in the @xmath24 plane and recording the corresponding @xmath25position of the base of the cantilever @xmath26 .",
    "a feedback mechanism adjusts @xmath26 such that @xmath22 stays constant . in the `` classic '' mode of operation , typical parameters are @xmath27hz , @xmath28",
    "n / m , @xmath29khz , @xmath30 nm and @xmath31 - see table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "equation [ z_noise ] shows that the vertical resolution in fm - afm can be improved by reducing the amplitude @xmath20 to the  - range @xcite . for tip - sample forces",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 is the tip - sample distance , the vertical noise @xmath34 is a function of the amplitude @xmath20 , the force range @xmath35 , the detection bandwidth @xmath36 and the temperature @xmath37 : @xmath38 minimal noise results when @xmath39 and for a small product of temperature and bandwidth .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath36 is approximately equal to the number of pixels per second which can be recorded .",
    "operating at a small bandwidth implies a small scanning speed and long image acquisition times , and thermal drift can become a problem . when operating at low temperatures , thermal drift is usually not present and imaging at very small scanning speeds is feasible .",
    "operation with very small amplitudes is not possible with conventional cantilevers . in order to avoid instabilities like jump - to - contactand to minimize perturbations of the oscillation by tip - sample dissipation",
    ", it helps to use cantilevers with @xmath40n / m and @xmath41 @xcite . a secondary benefit of using small amplitudes is an enhanced sensitivity to short - range forces and a reduced sensitivity to long - range forces ( see fig . [ convolution_deltaf ] ) .",
    "the oscillator electronics which controls the force sensor is designed with an emphasis on low noise such that oscillation amplitudes in the  - range can be realized .",
    "the commercial phase - locked - loop ( pll ) frequency detector is quartz stabilized @xcite . in the vacuum chamber ,",
    "pumped with an ion and titanium sublimation pump , a base pressure of @xmath42 mbar is reached . as a sample ,",
    "a @xmath43 mm@xmath44 piece of a p - doped ( b ) silicon ( 111 ) wafer with a resistivity of 9@xmath45 cm is used and the 7@xmath07 - reconstruction is obtained by heating to @xmath46c for 30s with an electron beam heater .",
    "typically , the experiment is started by operating the microscope in the stm mode , i.e. the feedback is controlled by the tunneling current , because the tip can be cleaned and conditioned by applying voltage pulses .",
    "the frequency shift is recorded in parallel with the topography .",
    "the tunneling current is collected at the sample and a typical setpoint of the time - averaged tunneling current is @xmath47pa .",
    "the surface is scanned in search for a clean spot which displays large areas of reconstructed silicon .",
    "also , controlled collisions between tip and sample are performed in order to shape the tip such that good stm images are obtained . the frequency shift which occurs during stm imaging",
    "is used as a reference before switching into the afm mode .",
    "then , the tip is withdrawn and the feedback is switched to frequency shift control .",
    "the setpoint of the frequency shift is slowly decreased while the tip is scanning .",
    "while carefully decreasing the setpoint of the frequency shift , the corrugation of the image is increasing until an optimal value is reached .",
    "one complication of afm versus stm is that unlike in stm , the imaging signal in afm is not monotonic with respect to distance . the tunneling current increases monotonically with decreasing tip - sample distance .",
    "however , the tip - sample force is in general attractive for large tip - sample distance and turns repulsive at a distance of the order of the equilibrium distance in the bulk crystal .",
    "consequently , the frequency shift is also non - monotonic .",
    "figure [ gamma_min ] shows a schematic curve of a short - range tip sample interaction curve and the corresponding observable in fm - afm - the normalized frequency shift @xmath48- curve ( see eq .",
    "[ gamma_def ] ) .",
    "because the feedback in an fm - afm uses the frequency shift as the error signal , stable feedback is only possible on a monotonic branch of the frequency shift curve . when operating on the branch with positive slope , the feedback system withdraws the cantilever from the surface when the actual frequency shift is smaller ( i.e. more negative ) than the setpoint and vice versa . when operating at the branch with negative slope , the sign of the control output has to be reversed for obtaining proper feedback operation .",
    "the two branches meet at @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "et al . _ have identified the distance range where atomic resolution is possible and found that atomic resolution is obtained for @xmath33 close to @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "for the frequency shift curve shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_min ] , stable feedback on the branch with positive slope is only possible for @xmath52 . for accessing a smaller distance range ,",
    "an additional long - range force can be added by applying an electric field .",
    "hence , @xmath51 is shifted to a smaller distance and tip and sample can get closer while the feedback still operates correctly .",
    "this is important for imaging atomic orbitals as evident from fig .",
    "when the gradient of the tip sample forces @xmath53 is constant for the whole @xmath33 range of the tip motion , the frequency shift is given by @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath26 is the mean @xmath25position of the cantilever tip .",
    "if @xmath55 is not constant for the @xmath25range covered by the oscillating cantilever @xmath56 , @xmath22 can be calculated by first order perturbation theory using the hamilton - jacobi approach @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath26 is the vertical base position of the cantilever as shown in fig .",
    "[ fmmode ] .",
    "the precision of @xmath22 obtained by first order perturbation theory is determined by the ratio between the magnitude of the perturbation ( i.e. the tip sample potential @xmath58 ) and the energy @xmath59 of the oscillating cl .",
    "this ratio is in the order of @xmath60 both in classic fm - afm with soft cantilevers and large amplitudes ( @xmath61n / m , @xmath62 nm ) as well as in non - contact afm operated with very stiff cantilevers and small amplitudes ( @xmath63n / m , @xmath64 nm ) . in both cases , the energy @xmath65 of the cantilever is @xmath66kev while the magnitude of @xmath58 does not exceed a few ev , at least for the cases where atomic resolution is desired and the interaction between tip and sample is dominated by the front atom of the tip .",
    "substituting @xmath67 , @xmath68 yields @xmath69 integration by parts yields an expression which is closely related to eq .",
    "[ df small a ] @xcite : @xmath70 the frequency shift is proportional to an average tip - sample force gradient , which is calculated by weighing the force gradient with a semi - circle with radius @xmath20 ( fig . [ convolution_deltaf ] ) .",
    "thus , the use of small amplitudes increases the relative contribution of short - range forces and reduces the contribution of long - range forces to the frequency shift .",
    "the frequency shift is a function of four parameters : @xmath71 , and @xmath33 .",
    "it is useful to exploit the scaling properties of @xmath22 in order to be able to scale calculated frequency shifts to a variety of experimental situations .",
    "the frequency shift is strictly proportional to @xmath17 and @xmath72 , and if @xmath20 is large compared to the range of the forces ( this condition is usually fulfilled , see below ) , it scales as @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , it is useful to define a `` normalized frequency shift '' @xmath74 explicitly , we find @xmath75 again , we can integrate by parts and we find that @xmath76 is also given by the convolution of @xmath53 with a weight function : @xmath77 if the amplitude @xmath20 is large compared to the range of the tip - sample forces , the normalized frequency shift @xmath78 asymptotically reaches a large amplitude limit @xmath48 .",
    "this is explicitly shown for inverse power , power- and exponential forces in ref .",
    "for stillinger - weber forces ( see below ) , the deviation between @xmath78 and @xmath48 is less than 3% for @xmath79 . for large amplitudes",
    ", we find @xmath80 experimental fm - afm images can be created in the topographic mode , where the frequency shift is kept constant and the @xmath33- position is adjusted accordingly as a function of @xmath81 and @xmath82 and the constant height mode where the frequency shift is recorded for constant @xmath33 as a function of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus , topographic fm - afm images correspond to a three - dimensional map of @xmath83 , and constant height images correspond to a three - dimensional map of @xmath84 . because the frequency shift of the cantilever is only a function of the @xmath25 component of the tip - sample force , @xmath84 is simply given by :    @xmath85    it is noted , that eq .",
    "[ gammafts3d ] implies that the cantilever vibrates exactly parallel to the surface normal vector of the sample .",
    "conventional cantilevers have a tip which is only a few micrometers high , therefore they have to be tilted by an angle @xmath8610@xmath87 to make sure that among all the parts of the cantilever and cantilever holder , the tip is the closest part to the sample .",
    "if the cantilever is tilted around the @xmath88 axis , @xmath76 is given by @xmath89 the qplus sensor does not need to be tilted because it can be outfitted with large tips ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) and in the simulations presented here , @xmath90 is assumed .",
    "drig has devised an expanded approach for the calculation of the frequency shift which also encompasses the damping effects @xcite .",
    "the first step for the simulation of images is the calculation of the tip sample forces @xmath91 .",
    "one approach for this task is the use of the density functional theory and related methods , such as shown by perez _",
    "however , as emphasized by bazant _",
    "@xcite the use of empirical force models still has its merits , because _ ab initio _ methods require much more computing power and programming effort than the use of empirical force models . here , we estimate the force between the tip of a cantilever and a flat sample @xmath92 by a long - range component that is only a function of vertical tip - sample distance @xmath33 and a short - range force that also depends on the lateral coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath82 : @xmath93      in principle , the van - der - waals ( vdw ) force is a short - range force , characterized by the @xmath94 vdw potential",
    ". however , the vdw force between two individual atoms is weak compared to the chemical and electrostatic short - range forces .",
    "nevertheless , the total vdw force between a typical afm tip and a flat sample can be substantial . when assuming that the vdw force is additive , the sum over the individual pair contributions can be replaced by an integration over the volume of the tip and sample ( hamaker integration ) @xcite .",
    "for a spherical tip with radius @xmath95 , the vdw force is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the hamaker constant and @xmath98 is the distance between the center of the front atom of the tip and the plane connecting the centers of the top layer of the sample atoms . for a si tip and a si sample , @xmath99aj @xcite .",

    "the electrostatic force for a spherical tip with radius @xmath95 at a differential voltage @xmath116 with respect to a flat surface at distance @xmath98 is given by @xcite @xmath117 for @xmath118 , where @xmath116 is the bias voltage between tip and sample .",

    "the electrostatic potential is very large close to the nuclei of the atoms , and because the electrons shield this field , the electrostatic potential decays exponentially ( see eq .",
    "[ fnl ] ) .",
    "if a bias voltage @xmath116 is applied between tip and sample , surface charges will result and the electrostatic field has a component which decreases exponentially with the surface separation with a decay length @xmath122 @xcite .",

    "[ gamvdw+est387 ] , we have also taken the short - range electrostatic force into account .    because we have approximated the charges of the dangling bonds to concentrate on a point , the simulated adatom image shows two spherical subpeaks - in contrast to the crescent shaped experimental subpeaks .",
    "we expect that if accurate charge distributions were taken into account , crescent shaped simulated images would result .",
    "the height of the simulated adatoms , the distance of the subpeaks and the dip between the subpeaks is in excellent agreement with the experimental images .    since our first observation of subatomic features by afm ,",
    "we have observed similar images of double peaked adatom structures in various other experiments . in our first experiments ,",
    "the orientation of the double peaks was roughly perpendicular to the fast scanning direction . in figure",
    "[ 2peaks ] we present examples of afm data where the orientation of the crescents is clearly unrelated to the fast scanning direction .    because of the dramatic dependence of the images on the atomic tip state , the preparation of afm tips with a specified front atom symmetry and chemical identity is instrumental for performing well defined experiments .",
    "commercial silicon cantilever tips are oriented in a ( 001)direction . in silicon , the natural cleavage planes are ( 111 ) planes .",
    "if a macroscopic tip crystallite is limited by natural cleavage planes , a ( 001 ) oriented tip will in general not end in a single atom tip , but in a rooftop type of symmetry . a tip which points into a ( 111)direction , however",
    ", will end in a single atom if we assume bulk termination .",
    "moreover , the front atom of this tip is expected to be particularly stable , because it is bonded to the rest of the tip by three bonds and exposes a single dangling bond towards the sample .",
    "because of this prospects , we have attempted to cleave single crystalline silicon such that we obtained crystallites which were limited by ( 111 ) planes supposedly ending in a single atom tip @xcite .",
    "we have cleaved the silicon in air , so that an oxide layer of a typical thickness of 20 will develop at the surface .",
    "as expected , the tips did not yield good stm images after bringing them into vacuum .",
    "however , after exposing them to electron bombardment ( the same procedure is used for preparing the silicon 7@xmath07 surface ) , the tips work excellently in stm mode and also in afm mode .",
    "we speculate , that the ( 111 ) oriented sidewalls of the tip will reconstruct just like a flat silicon surface .",
    "even then , the front atom will be bonded to three next neighbors and expose a single dangling bond .",
    "figure [ afmi111 ] shows an afm image obtained with such a ( 111 ) oriented tip .",
    "it is also noted , that this image was recorded at _ positive _ frequency shift .",
    "hence , the forces between front atom and sample have been repulsive !",
    "an advantage of this mode is that the feedback can be set much faster , because the risk of feedback oscillations with a catastrophic tip crash is avoided in this mode . due to the faster feedback",
    "setting and the smaller scanning speed , the relative rms frequency error ( = @xmath165 ) is significantly smaller in fig .",
    "[ afmi111 ] ( 0.1 % ) than in fig .",
    "[ rtlltr ] ( 5.6 % ) .",
    "figure [ 111tipsim ] shows the simulated image .",
    "because the forces are repulsive , the dominant forces are modelled with the repulsive part of the sw potential .",
    "the experimental data which is presented here confirms the prediction of eq .",
    "[ z_noise ] : the resolution of the afm is improved by working at small oscillation amplitudes .",
    "the resolution obtained in the afm images is high enough such that the angular dependence of the tip - sample forces is revealed .",
    "chemical and electrostatic force models have been employed to explain and analyze the experimental images .",
    "the choice of our model forces leads to a qualitative agreement between experiment and simulations .",
    "the double peak images are well explained by a sw potential and additional electrostatic effects which polarize the orbitals .",
    "however , using only the sw potential for the short - range contribution results in a simulated height of the adatoms which is only 10% of the experimental value . adding the simple electrostatic short - range interaction , the height of the simulated adatoms agrees well with experiment , while the shape of the adatom images differs from experiment .",
    "the experimental images show crescents , while the theoretical images are spherical .",
    "it is apparent that the simulation of the images captures the basic principle , but needs to be refined for obtaining a better agreement with experiment .    the simulations covering the repulsive regime with a sw potential leads to a qualitative agreement between experiment and simulations .",
    "the simulation shows that the rest atoms , located between a corner adatom and two center adatoms , should be visible as a small protrusion .",
    "the experiment shows a saddlepoint at the expected rest atom positions and a hole between three center adatoms .",
    "however , the shape of the four types of adatoms is similar in the simulation and very different in the experiment which shows that taking only next neighbor interaction and bond angles into account is insufficient for a proper model of the forces between silicon atoms .",
    "also , the heights of the adatoms is much different than measured by leed or predicted by calculations @xcite . according to leed data ,",
    "the corner adatoms are only about 0.04 higher than the center adatoms . in our afm data ,",
    "the corner adatoms appear to be roughly 0.2  higher than the center adatoms .",
    "because this height difference is measured both with repulsive and attractive short - range forces , it can not be caused by elastic deformations of tip and sample .",
    "our simulations have shown , that the observation of atomic orbitals is only possible if the tip - sample distance is of the order of the interatomic distance in the bulk material .",
    "the forces that act for such small distances are large , and deformations and increased dissipation are expected to occur .",
    "these issues and the observability of atomic orbitals by stm are discussed in the following subsections .",
    "an important issue arises in the tip and sample stability .",
    "so far , we have assumed that both tip and sample atoms are not strained when the tip comes close to the sample . in stm",
    ", this might be the case when the tunneling impedance is large , and even in dynamic afm it is conceivable that @xmath91 is small enough such that the elastic deformation of tip and sample is not noticeable .",
    "however , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ sto ] , the observation of deviations of the spherical symmetry of atoms is only possible in the near field , i.e. for distances which are of the order of the bulk interatomic distance .",
    "thus , for observing these features by afm , tip and sample have to come very close , and the atoms close to the interaction region will suffer from noticeable strain .",
    "figure [ 100tip ] shows a ball and stick model of a silicon crystallite which is limited by ( 111 ) planes and points into a ( 001 ) direction .",
    "this crystallite is used as a model for our tip .",
    "the stiffness of the bonds of the front atom to the upper part of the tip can be estimated using the stillinger - weber potential .",
    "for the crystallite shown in fig .",
    "[ 100tip ] , the stiffness in @xmath33-direction is 115n / m , in @xmath81-direction it is 20.4n / m and in @xmath82-direction it is 224n / m .",
    "the stiffness can also be evaluated from the phonon spectrum of silicon . for an optical phonon at the @xmath166-point ( i.e. the wave vector is zero ) ,",
    "neighboring atoms vibrate opposite to each other .",
    "we can model this situation with a single silicon atoms which is suspended by four springs with half the length of the nearest neighbor distance , each having an effective spring constant in @xmath33-direction of @xmath167 the wave number of optical phonons in silicon at the @xmath166-point is 520@xmath168 which corresponds to @xmath169thz @xcite .",
    "the mean atomic mass ( natural mixture of isotopes ) of silicon is 28.086amu @xcite , thus the spring constant @xmath170447.45n / m = 111.9n / m .",
    "the stiffness of the two bonds connecting the front atom of the tip crystallite with the rest of the tip is given by twice the stiffness of one full - length bond with @xmath171 yielding @xmath172 n / m  in excellent agreement with the value of 115n / m derived from the stillinger - weber potential .",
    "the positions of the two atoms which attach to the front atom have been kept fixed for the derivations . in reality",
    ", all the tip atoms will respond to the force on the front atom .",
    "the effect can be estimated by arranging the springs corresponding to a tip atom layer in series .",
    "for the tip shown in fig .",
    "[ 100tip ] , the @xmath173-th bilayer contains one layer with @xmath174 and one layer with @xmath175 atoms .",
    "each of these atoms has two bonds to the layer above .",
    "the effective stiffness of the tip crystallite in @xmath33-direction is then given by @xmath176= \\frac{1}{k_{z } } ( 1+\\frac{\\pi^2}{6})\\approx \\frac{1}{0.4\\cdot k_{z}}.\\ ] ] for tip - sample forces of the order of 2nn , we expect that the bonds between the front atom of the tip and its next neighbors will be strained by @xmath177 .",
    "the total strain of the tip is expected to be @xmath178 .",
    "it is expected that the sample will become strained to a similar extent .",
    "we expect that in addition to the damping channels which are present in classic fm - afm , an even more significant damping channel will open up for very small tip sample distances .",
    "when the front atom of the tip moves to the sample , both the front atom and the adjacent sample atom will be pulled from their equilibrium position and relax when the cantilever swings back from the sample .",
    "this process will happen adiabatically and dissipate little energy as long as the closest distance is larger than the distance where the maximal attractive force @xmath179 occurs ( inflection point ) .",
    "however , when the distance between front atom and sample gets closer than the inflection point , an additional channel of significant energy loss will occur because the front atom of the tip and the sample atom will be pulled out of the equilibrium position , and rather than moving back adiabatically , will stick together until the bonding force is overcome by the withdrawing cantilever . at this point",
    ", the front atom and the sample atom will be pulled out by a distance @xmath180 .",
    "when the cantilever swings back , the front and sample atom will oscillate at the phonon frequency and dissipate the stored energy @xmath181 the maximal attractive force @xmath179 is about 4nn , according to the sw potential .",
    "thus , the energy loss per cycle due to this process is 0.08aj per atom . because both the front atom at the tip and the sample atom will be excited by this process",
    ", the total energy loss is thus of the order of 1ev per cycle .",
    "this energy has to be provided by the oscillator circuit which drives the cantilever .",
    "the intrinsic energy loss of the cantilever is @xmath182 , where @xmath18 is the spring constant of the cantilever , @xmath20 is its oscillation amplitude and @xmath19 is its quality factor . for the qplus sensor , @xmath183 and @xmath184n / m . for an amplitude of the order of 1 nm ,",
    "the intrinsic loss per cycle is of the order of 10ev and the extra loss due to tip - sample dissipation is small . with conventional silicon cantilevers , typical @xmath19 factors are at least one order of magnitude larger and the intrinsic dissipation is much smaller .",
    "amplitude control can become difficult with conventional cantilevers when attempting to get very close to the sample as required for observing the orbital structure of atoms .      to our knowledge ,",
    "the observation of multiple maxima in the image of a single atom in stm mode has not been reported before .",
    "we can identify three possible explanations why the internal orbital electron structure of atoms is observable by afm , but apparently not by stm :    1 .   as shown in fig .",
    "[ sto ] , the tip sample distance needs to be very small before the charge density of valence electrons displays a noticeable deviation from the rotational symmetry about the @xmath25 axis .",
    "typical tip - sample distances ( from the center of the tip atom to the center of the closest sample atom ) are @xmath185 in stm .",
    "when attempting to image in stm mode at a tip sample distance of @xmath186 , the tip - sample force is very large and the tip atom or sample atom may not withstand the shear forces acting during scanning . in dynamic afm , this small distance occurs only intermittently and the lateral movement can occur during the oscillation phase where the tip is far from the sample ; 2 .",
    "while it is known that the force between two atoms is in general attractive at large distances and becomes repulsive at short distances , the tunneling current is usually assumed to be a monotonic function of the distance .",
    "thus , it is expected that the orbital structure of the valence electrons has a larger effect on the force than on the tunneling current ; 3 .   in the stm mode ,",
    "typical tunneling voltages used for imaging silicon are of the order of 2v and the energy of the tip and sample states which contribute to the tunneling current is spread over a range of 2ev . just like in atomic wave functions , where the angular dependent @xmath187 and @xmath188 sub - shells add up to a spherically symmetric charge distribution",
    "if all the states of a given main quantum number are filled , we expect that a similar process can happen in tunneling experiments when a range of tip and sample energies contributes to the total tunneling current .",
    "so it is conceivable that even if some states which contribute to tunneling are not symmetric with respect to the @xmath25axis , the sum of these states is symmetric around @xmath33 .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that atomic force microscopy offers new insights into the atomic structure and symmetry of surface atoms and afm tips .",
    "we are confident that using small oscillation amplitudes , stiff cantilevers and oscillator setups which are insensitive to the enhanced damping at very close tip - sample distances provides a new experimental tool to study the nature of the atomic bond and the electronic structure of atoms .",
