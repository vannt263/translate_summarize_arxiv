    "if a granular sample of a high - t@xmath0 superconductor ( htsc ) is cooled down to its critical temperature ( let us call it @xmath6 ) in the presence of a magnetic field , its electrical resistance suddenly falls to a value that can be as low as 30% of the normal - state resistance just above @xmath6 ( see fig . 5 in section  [ sect : experimental ] ) .",
    "this effect , common to many cuprates , is due to the superconducting transition of the grains while the intergrain regions ( weak links ) remain in the resistive state @xcite . on further cooling",
    ", the sample resistance gradually decreases , eventually becoming zero at a temperature @xmath2 whose value depends on the applied magnetic field . in this second stage of the superconducting transition ,",
    "the transport properties of the specimen are entirely controlled by the weak links between grains , that can be thought of as s - n - s josephson junctions @xcite with randomly - distributed critical energies . according to this approach , when the temperature is lowered the superconducting wavefunctions of the grains gradually lock in phase .",
    "this gives rise to long - range coherence and finally to the bulk superconductivity .",
    "of course , the transition of each junction from the superconducting to the resistive state ( or vice - versa ) is controlled by the temperature , the current density crossing the junction and the local magnetic field .",
    "these three parameters , together with the distribution of the josephson critical energies , are thus expected to play a major role in determining the electrical behaviour of the material .",
    "the transition also depends on wether the magnetic field is applied during the cooling of the sample ( field cooling , fc ) or after cooling ( zero field cooling , zfc ) . actually , in the fc case field penetration and",
    "trapping within the grains reduces the transition probability of the weak links , and consequently the value of the electrical resistance , by reducing the flux compression factor .",
    "this last quantity will be introduced and discussed in section  [ sect : model ] of this paper .",
    "finally , in many cases , the electrical properties of granular htsc below @xmath6 are found to depend on the angle between the magnetic field @xmath1 and the macroscopic current density @xmath3 , even if the grains are randomly oriented .",
    "this indicates the existence of an electrical anisotropy of the material , induced by the application of an external magnetic field . that also this anisotropy is related to the complex transition dynamics of the weak link network is demonstrated by its almost complete absence in high - density polycrystalline mgb@xmath7 samples , where grains are connected through metallic contacts and there are no weak links@xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will propose an explanation for the observed electrical anisotropy in a zero - field - cooled granular htsc .",
    "the leading idea of the model is that the screening supercurrents flowing on the surface of the superconducting grains create a local `` demagnetising field '' that adds to the external one creating a strongly non - uniform field distribution in the integrain regions .",
    "we will show that this field distribution gives rise to a structural anisotropy in the network of resistive weak links , so that the material behaves as a uniaxially anisotropic medium for the current transport . by starting from simple hypotheses , which will be discussed and supported by experimental evidences",
    ", we will develop a simple network model that allows calculating the electrical resistance of the material as a function of the magnetic field and of the current density in the two cases where @xmath4 and @xmath8 .",
    "finally , we will compare the results of our calculations with an extensive set of experimental results obtained on a ybco granular specimen .",
    "let us focus on a zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) granular superconductor .",
    "suppose to feed it with a current of density @xmath3 and to apply a magnetic field @xmath1 such that the bulk superconductivity is disrupted , but the grains remain in the meissner state .",
    "as long as the grains exclude the magnetic field , experiments show that the resistance vs. magnetic field curves are very nearly reversible .",
    "this reversibility shows that it is the flux pinning within the grains that originates hysteresis , while flux pinning in the intergrain regions is negligible . in these conditions ,",
    "the electrical resistance is found to depend on whether the magnetic field @xmath1 and the macroscopic current density @xmath3 are parallel or perpendicular to each other .",
    "this anisotropy was already evidenced by some measurements of critical current @xcite , resistivity @xcite , magnetization @xcite , power dissipation @xcite and i - v characteristics @xcite in different htscs .",
    "most of the relevant papers propose an explanation for the anisotropy based on the conventional theories of the current - driven vortex motion in the mixed state . within this picture ,",
    "the anisotropy arises from the fact that the lorentz force between transport current and vortices depends on the angle between @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "actually , this requires that the material behaves as a nearly homogeneous medium with an effective penetration depth @xmath9 , where the magnetic flux penetrates in the form of vortices as in conventional type - ii superconductors . as pointed out by ginzburg _",
    "@xcite this approach is reasonable as long as @xmath9 is much greater than the average grain size , and fluxons can be taken parallel to the external field . even in this case , however , the conventional theories must be improved  for example to explain why , in the `` @xmath8 '' case , the voltage drop across the specimen is far from being nearly zero .",
    "finally , experimental results that will be presented in the following section clearly indicate that the anisotropy gradually vanishes when the temperature approaches @xmath6 , and this behavior is not easily explicable within the picture described so far .    in the following",
    "we will propose a completely different explanation for the electrical anisotropy induced in granular htscs by the magnetic field .",
    "we will start by representing the material as a set of irregularly shaped grains connected through thin intergrain regions that behave as weak links .",
    "we will think of these weak links as resistively shunted josephson junctions with a perfect ohmic behavior in the normal state  that is , with a normal - state resistance independent of both magnetic field and current , as well as of the angle between them .",
    "this assumption finds again support in the fact that , at temperatures close to @xmath6  when almost all the weak links are in the resistive state  the anisotropy disappears .",
    "this suggests that the anisotropy is related to the _ spatial distribution _ of superconductive and resistive weak links within the material , rather than to an intrinsic dependence of the intergrain resistivity on the orientation of @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "the problem now is to understand why the distribution of resistive weak links should be anisotropic .",
    "we argue that this distribution is mainly determined by the distribution of the local magnetic field intensity in the intergrain region . as a matter of fact",
    ", the local magnetic field @xmath10 is given by the superposition of the external field @xmath1 and of the magnetic field created by the screening supercurrents that flow on the grains surfaces .",
    "as a result , the local field intensity @xmath11 in a given weak link can be very different from @xmath12  and can vary very drastically from a weak link to another .",
    "simple geometrical considerations lead to the conclusion that this variation is related to the spatial orientation of the weak links with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the strong non - uniformity of the local field makes the transition probability of the weak links be anisotropic .",
    "therefore , the spatial distribution of weak links that undergo the transition to the resistive state becomes anisotropic as well , and the material behaves as a uniaxially anisotropic medium for the current .",
    "the influence of the screening supercurrents of the grains on the intergrain region was already invoked to explain other interesting properties of granular superconductors , such as the hysteresis of the critical current @xcite and the ac magnetization curves @xcite . in the original approach by evetts and glowacki",
    "@xcite it was assumed that a sufficiently weak magnetic field can be excluded both by grains and by superconducting `` islands '' bounded by closed paths , called `` rings '' , made up of grains connected through weak links with relatively high critical currents . according to their discussion ,",
    "the screening supercurrents flowing along the boundaries of the superconducting regions create `` flux compression '' in the surrounding weak links where the field has penetrated , which thus experience a magnetic field more intense than the applied one .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that , in that paper , the local magnetic field outside the superconducting regions was supposed to be _ everywhere _ greater than the applied field .    on the contrary , experimental studies of the ac magnetization of granular htscs led chandran and chaddah @xcite to suggest that the screening supercurrents flowing on the grain surface give rise to `` flux compression '' in the weak links laying on planes parallel to the external field @xmath1 , and to an almost complete magnetic shielding of the weak links perpendicular to @xmath1 . in spite of the oversimplification implicit in this model ",
    "grains are thought to be cubic and arranged in a regular lattice , as in fig.1  the idea it is based on can be safely assumed to explain the origin of the magnetic field - induced anisotropy of the resistance in granular superconductors .    in the present paper , we shall neglect the possible contribution of superconducting `` rings '' to the non - uniformity of the local magnetic field in the intergrain regions .",
    "actually , the experimental results to which we will compare the theoretical predictions of our model were obtained on a ybco granular specimen with a small critical current density ( less than @xmath13a / m@xmath14 at @xmath15  k ) .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the maximum magnetic field created by this current density flowing on a circular ring made up of grains and superconducting weak links is definitely negligible with respect to the magnetic fields considered here , even if the ring is very small .",
    "notice that also in refs .",
    "@xcite experimental results were reported , suggesting that flux trapping or exclusion is mostly due to the grains , rather than to persistent superconducting loops in the weak link network .",
    "the model we are going to present in the following arises from a generalization of the idea by chandran and chaddah @xcite to a more realistic case , in which the grains have irregular shape and the weak links are randomly oriented in space .",
    "we will show that this model quantitatively explains the results of a set of resistance measurements we carried out on a ybco granular specimen .",
    "to discuss the origin of the field - induced resistance anisotropy in granular htscs , let us start with the analysis of the ideal , simplified case in which the material is made up of a set of identical cubic grains arranged in a regular lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubic ] . within this simple picture ,",
    "the weak links are represented by the flat , square surfaces separating adjacent grains .",
    "let the magnetic field @xmath1 be applied parallel to one of the grain edges , for example along the vertical direction .",
    "as previously discussed , @xmath1 is assumed to be intense enough to destroy the magnetic screening of the sample as a whole ( due to the supercurrent flowing on the sample surface ) , but weak enough not to penetrate into the grains .",
    "let @xmath16 be the angle between the field @xmath1 and the normal @xmath17 to a given weak - link surface .",
    "it is clear that , in this simple model , only the values @xmath18 ( corresponding to @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( corresponding to @xmath21 ) are possible .    , and is greater than the applied one in the weak links with @xmath20 . this field enhancement is usually referred to as `` flux compression '' . ]    the screening supercurrents flowing on the surface of each grain , which is supposed to be in the meissner state , create a `` demagnetizing field '' that cancels out the external magnetic field @xmath1 inside the grain . in the surrounding weak links ,",
    "the local magnetic field @xmath10 is given by the superposition of the demagnetizing fields of adjacent grains and of the external field @xmath1 .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the resulting local magnetic field is much more intense than the external one ( i.e. , the flux is `` compressed '' ) in the weak links having @xmath20 , while it is zero in the weak links having @xmath18 .    in the hypothesis that the weak links behave as josephson junctions ,",
    "their transition to the resistive state occurs when the density of the current crossing the junction is greater than a critical value @xmath22 which depends on the temperature and on the local magnetic field .",
    "therefore , when the current density @xmath3 is perpendicular to the external field @xmath1 , the condition for the resistive transition is easily satisfied in the weak links having @xmath20 , which are crossed by the current and submitted to a strong magnetic field .",
    "the resistance of the sample is thus different from zero .    on the contrary , when @xmath3 is parallel to @xmath1 the weak links having @xmath18 remain in the superconducting state even though they are crossed by the current ( provided that the current density is not too large ) because of the magnetic screening of the grains .",
    "therefore , each vertical column of interconnected grains behaves as a superconducting path for the current , and the specimen resistance drops to zero .",
    "to summarize , the non - uniformity of the local magnetic field makes the spatial distribution of resistive weak links depend on the direction of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the macroscopic result is a field - induced anisotropy of the transport properties of the material ( in particular , of the resistivity ) .",
    "after this simple explanation of the basic mechanism , the generalization of the model to a more realistic situation , in which grains have irregular shape and size , has now to be considered .",
    "we shall adopt a statistical point of view and make some simple assumptions , consistent with the experimental conditions .",
    "let us identify the weak links with flat elements approximating the surface separating adjacent grains , with random orientation in space and average area @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the unit - length vector normal to their surface , @xmath16 the angle between @xmath17 and the applied magnetic field @xmath1 , and @xmath24 the angle between @xmath17 and the _ macroscopic _ current density @xmath3 . to indicate the vectorial average of the current density within the whole specimen .",
    "instead , the local current density will be indicated by @xmath25 .",
    "] let @xmath10 and @xmath25 be the _ local _ magnetic field and current density within a weak link .",
    "notice that , as long as the grains are in the meissner state , @xmath10 must be _ parallel _ to the weak - link surface  that is , tangent to the grain boundary .",
    "we will further assume that the weak links behave as ideal resistively shunted josephson junctions , with a perfect ohmic behavior above the transition , and that they have all the same resistive - state conductance per unit surface , @xmath26 .",
    "in principle , each weak link undergoes the transition from the superconducting to the resistive state when the local current density @xmath27 is greater than a critical value @xmath28 .",
    "however , complex transient phenomena occurring at the beginning of the conduction process make it very difficult to determine the actual spatial distribution of the resistive weak links .",
    "these phenomena are due to correlation effects acting on the local current distribution , which , for instance , prevent the weak links embedded in a superconducting region to undergo the resistive transition . anyway , when the whole specimen becomes macroscopically resistive , a stationary situation similar to that sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : layers ] must be reached . at the equilibrium",
    ", the specimen must be thought of as divided in a set of equipotential regions separated by resistive layers extended throughout the specimen cross - section .",
    "intense enough to make it macroscopically resistive . at the equilibrium ,",
    "the sample consists of equipotential superconducting regions ( gray ) , separated by resistive layers ( irregular solid lines ) made up of resistive weak links .",
    "the effect of the relative orientation of @xmath1 and @xmath3 is made clear by comparing ( a ) with ( b ) .",
    "it is related to the fact that the probability for a weak link to undergo the transition to the resistive state is larger when @xmath1 is parallel to its surface , and smaller when @xmath1 is perpendicular to it . ]",
    "the equipotential regions consist of several superconducting grains and of the weak links between them . of course",
    ", all these weak links must be in the superconducting state , since any potential drop within these regions is forbidden .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that the magnetic flux _ may _ penetrate within the weak links embedded in an equipotential region , but the local current density should remain below its critical value to avoid the resistive transition .",
    "the resistive layers , instead , are made up of resistive weak links . since these layers separate two regions at different potential , the local current density @xmath25 that crosses them must be always _ perpendicular _ to their surface , while the local magnetic field @xmath10 is tangent to it .",
    "since the weak links are assumed to behave as ideal shunted josephson junctions with a perfect ohmic behaviors above the transition , the electrical resistance of each layer may be considered as independent of both @xmath10 and @xmath25 .",
    "as already pointed out , this last assumption is supported by the resistance vs. temperature curves reported in fig.5 , measured in a ybco granular specimen described in section  [ sect : experimental ] .    at a given temperature ,",
    "the transition of a weak link to the resistive state is completely determined by @xmath10 and @xmath25 . as a good approximation",
    ", we can say that the transition occurs when @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the value of the local critical current density in zero magnetic field , and @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the magnetic penetration depth , @xmath34 is the mean radius of the grains , and @xmath35 is the flux quantum .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : jell ] ) represents the envelope of the fraunhofer - like @xmath36 vs. @xmath12 curve of a single josephson junction in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the junction itself @xcite .",
    "using the envelope instead of the true function is usual when a statistical approach is needed ",
    "i.e. , when a large number of junctions enter into the model . actually , as far as the inverse proportionality between @xmath27 and @xmath11 is concerned , the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jell ] ) is supported by experimental results that will be discussed in section [ sect : experimental ] .    for",
    "any given value @xmath27 of the current density , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jell ] ) can be interpreted as a condition on the intensity of the local magnetic field , @xmath11 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath11 giving rise to the transition will be indicated in the following by @xmath37    with reference to the equilibrium situation described in fig .",
    "2 , the local current density in a resistive weak link is given by @xmath38 thus , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcjell ] ) becomes : @xmath39    we will assume that , for a given value of the local current density , the critical fields @xmath40 of the weak links follow a gaussian distribution with mean value @xmath41 and standard deviation @xmath42 .",
    "in fact , the fluctuation of @xmath40 around its mean value  within the weak - link ensemble characterized by a given value of @xmath25  is due to several uncorrelated causes : the grain orientation mismatch , impurity segregation at the grain boundaries , non - stoichiometric local oxygen content , etc . in these cases",
    "the assumption that the fluctuation is gaussian is generally accepted .",
    "we further assume that @xmath42 is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "this assumption can be justified by observing that when @xmath41 is , for instance , reduced as a consequence of an increment of @xmath27 , also the fluctuation around its value must change accordingly . actually , it must be noticed that @xmath41 depends on @xmath27 and thus on the spherical angles @xmath16 and @xmath43 , and that the average is intended to be made over the set of weak links characterized by given values of these angles .    equation ( [ eq : hcjell2 ] )",
    "indicates that the critical field of each weak link depends on the angle @xmath24 between its normal @xmath17 and the current density @xmath3 .",
    "however , the intensity of the local magnetic field in the weak link , @xmath11 , is expected to depend in some way on the angle @xmath16 between @xmath17 and @xmath1 . that this dependence should exist",
    "is suggested by the simple model of cubic grains , where the value of the local field was easily determined for all the allowed values of @xmath16 . in the more realistic case of irregular - shaped grains we are facing here ,",
    "flux lines meander through the sample , without violating the requirement of continuity .",
    "it is thus very likely , for instance , that flux lines are forced to pass through weak links with a very low value of @xmath16 , or that weak links with @xmath16 close to @xmath44 are almost completely screened .",
    "since the value of @xmath11 in a given weak link characterized by an angle @xmath16 also depends on the position and on the angle distribution of the nearby weak links , it is reasonable to assume also in this case a gaussian distribution of @xmath45 around its mean value @xmath46 with a variance @xmath47 proportional , as in the previous case , to @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath48 should always be tangent to the grain surface , we can rather safely assume that the dependence of @xmath46 on @xmath16 is expressed by the equation : @xmath49 analogous to the expression of the local magnetic field intensity on the surface of a superconducting sphere immersed in a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in this equation , @xmath50 is a constant magnetic field intensity that is related to the external magnetic field through a `` flux compression factor '' @xmath51 that takes into account the effect of the flux exclusion by the grains .",

    "let s now assume that the magnetic field @xmath1 is applied parallel to the @xmath52 axis ( whose direction is defined by the unit - length vector @xmath53 . to determine the value of @xmath50 , we first write down an expression for the mean value of the @xmath52-component of @xmath10 over the ensemble of weak links with the same @xmath16 . with reference to fig",

    "in fact , if no superconducting rings survive , the magnetic field is only excluded by the grains and its dispersion at the sample edges is expected to be negligible . in these conditions ,",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath56 is very nearly constant all along the specimen and obviously equal to @xmath57 , where @xmath12 is the intensity of the applied magnetic field @xmath1 ( which is taken parallel to the @xmath52 axis ) and @xmath58 is the specimen cross - section perpendicular to it . on the other hand ,",

    "results of the numerical calculations are reported and discussed in section  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we report the results of an extensive set of resistance measurements we carried out on a granular ybco specimen . the sample , of about @xmath120  mm@xmath121 ,",
    "was obtained by sinterization of high - purity powders of y@xmath122o@xmath123 , baco@xmath123 , and cuo in the stoichiometry ratio @xmath124 .",
    "the oxygen content of the ybco chains was then modified by a long - time annealing ( 30 days ) in a controlled oxygen atmosphere at @xmath125  k. this process had a twofold effect on the critical parameters of the material .",
    "first , it lowered the critical temperature down to @xmath126  k ; second , it reduced the critical current , that was found to be as low as 2.5@xmath12710@xmath128  a / m@xmath14 at @xmath15  k and in zero field .",
    "while the first effect can be ascribed to a change in the oxygen doping in the grains , the second is mainly due to a strong weakening of the links between grains .",
    "this made the transport properties of the material below @xmath6 be mostly controlled by the weak links in a wide range of magnetic fields .",
    "the resistance measurements were carried out by using the conventional four - probe technique .",
    "the four contacts were obtained by ag evaporation at the opposite ends of the sample .",
    "both the current and voltage leads were made of thin pt wires fixed to the ag contact by using ag conductive paste . to eliminate the possible unwanted contributions of thermoelectric voltages , the current - reversal technique was used . moreover , to avoid the small joule heating of the sample , the current was injected into the sample only during the time strictly necessary for the measurement .",
    "the magnetic field was applied either parallel or perpendicular to the current , which was always flowing along the same direction , i.e. parallel to the longest side of the sample .     vs. @xmath129 curves measured in the ybco specimen described in the paper , in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath1 perpendicular to the current density @xmath3 .",

    "the drop of the resistance at the temperature @xmath132  k is due to the superconducting transition of the grains , while the intergrain regions remain in the resistive state .",

    "[ fig:5 ] were obtained at a fixed value of the magnetic field and different current densities ( a ) , or at a fixed current and different magnetic fields ( b ) . in both cases ,",
    "the magnetic field @xmath1 was perpendicular to the current @xmath3 .",
    "the clear step of the curves at the temperature @xmath133  k indicates that , at this temperature , the grains become superconductive while all the weak links remain in the resistive state .",
    "it is clearly seen that the residual resistance just below @xmath6 is practically independent of both the magnetic field intensity @xmath12 and the current density @xmath116 .",
    "if the temperature is further lowered , instead , the @xmath134 curves split depending on the values of @xmath12 and @xmath116 .",
    "[ fig:6 ] shows the resistance vs. temperature curves obtained with fixed values of @xmath12 and @xmath116 in the two cases where @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the residual resistance just below @xmath6 is as well unaffected by the respective orientation of these two vectors . since just below @xmath6 practically all the weak links are still in the resistive state , this residual resistance can be identified with that of the _ whole _ weak - link network .",
    "therefore , these results indirectly support our hypothesis that the normal - state resistance of _ each _ weak link is independent of @xmath1 and @xmath3  and thus on their respective orientation .    in order to study in greater detail the anisotropy of the resistance highlighted by the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , and to compare the predictions of our model with the experimental results , we measured the resistance of the sample as a function of the magnetic field intensity , by keeping both the temperature and the current fixed to a certain value .",

    "notice that the residual resistance just below @xmath6 is independent of the orientation of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "as discussed in the text , this suggests that the anisotropy is not due to an intrinsic dependence of the intergrain resistivity on the angle between @xmath1 and @xmath3 . ]",

    "solid ( open ) symbols indicate the resistance measured when the field is increased ( decreased ) , as indicated by the arrows .",
    "the onset of irreversibility at @xmath140  a / m is due to flux penetration and flux trapping inside the superconducting grains . below this value , instead , the @xmath135 vs. @xmath129 curves are nearly reversible , which indicates the almost complete absence of flux trapping either by grains or by superconducting rings . in this regime ,",
    "the changes in the resistance due to the magnetic field are attributed to weak - link transitions .",

    "[ fig:7 ] , solid ( open ) symbols indicate the resistance measured while the magnetic field intensity is increased ( decreased ) . it is clearly seen that the curves are very nearly reversible up to about @xmath141  a / m . in this regime ,",
    "the magnetic flux is very likely to be excluded by the grains , and the variation of the resistance due to the magnetic field can be ascribed to the transition of weak links from the superconductive to the resistive state , or vice - versa . moreover",
    ", the curves reported in fig .  [ fig:7 ] show that an approximate inverse proportionality exists between the magnetic field @xmath12 and the current density @xmath116 for a given value of the specimen resistance .",
    "in other words , the same resistance , let s say @xmath142  m@xmath111 , is obtained with @xmath143  a / m and @xmath137a / m@xmath14 , or with @xmath144  a / m and @xmath136a / m@xmath14 .",
    "this is exactly what is expected according to our model , if eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcjell ] ) holds true and the sample is not too close to the percolation threshold .",
    "when the field is increased above @xmath141  a / m , the magnetic flux begins to penetrate into the superconducting grains , where it remains trapped when the external field is decreased , thus giving rise to a strong hysteresis .",
    "let us discuss for a while what happens in this irreversible regime . at the beginning of the flux penetration into the grains ,",
    "the increment of the local magnetic field in the intergrain regions for a given increase of the external field is smaller than in the reversible regime .",
    "this results in a reduction of the slope of the @xmath135 versus @xmath12 curve . for higher values of the applied field",
    ", the flux penetration into grains gives rise to a decrement of the local magnetic field , even if the external field is increased , and then the slope of the curve becomes slightly negative , as clearly shown in the figure . within the model developed in the present paper",
    ", this effect can be interpreted as due to a reduction of the flux compression coefficient @xmath51 , which therefore turns out to depend on the magnetic field . actually , we disregarded this dependence and took @xmath51 as a constant , which is only true as long as the magnetic field _ does not _",
    "penetrate into the grains .",
    "incidentally , this is one of the reasons why the validity of our model is restricted to the reversible regime .",
    "let us just point out here that , if the field is further increased ( as we did in another set of measurements not reported here ) the slope becomes positive again . at about @xmath145  a / m , the resistance becomes practically constant and saturates to a current - independent value .",
    "notice that the same behaviour can be observed , close to @xmath6 , in the curves reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:5]a .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] two @xmath135 versus @xmath12 curves are shown , obtained with the same values of the current density ( @xmath146 a / m@xmath14 ) but in the two cases @xmath4 and @xmath8 . by starting from these data sets , the magnetic field - dependence of the ratio @xmath147",
    "can be easily obtained . as a matter of fact , this dependence is reported in fig .",

    "the values of the best - fit parameters , reported in the figure caption , will be discussed in the next section .",

    "solid symbols represent experimental data , while open circles are theoretical points calculated by means of eq.([eq : eta2 ] ) .",

    "the ratio between the two values of @xmath154 is clearly the inverse of the ratio between the current densities , in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcjell ] ) .",
    "the widths of the distributions of critical fields and local fields were taken as being @xmath155 and @xmath156 for both the curves .",
    "notice that the actual values of @xmath41 may be an order of magnitude greater than those of @xmath154 , owing to the effect of the flux compression coefficient @xmath51 . ]",
    "the results reported in fig .  [ fig:9 ] show that there is a general agreement between the experimental data and the results of our model .",
    "the agreement is particularly good for intermediate values of the magnetic field intensity . instead , some deviations between experimental and theoretical results are evident for low and high values of the applied field . on account of what was already pointed out in the previous sections , these deviations are not surprising . as a matter of fact",
    ", our model has been developed under the assumption that the specimen was neither too close to the superconductive percolation threshold ( that takes place when the magnetic field is too weak ) , nor in the condition of flux penetration within the grains ( that occurs when the field is too intense ) .",
    "let us now focus on the best - fitting values of the parameters that enter in our model . in principle , the adjustable parameters of the model are : the mean critical field @xmath115 , the flux compression factor @xmath51 , and the standard deviations @xmath47 and @xmath42 , characterizing the spread of the local values of @xmath45 and @xmath157 .",
    "since , according to the assumptions made above , @xmath47 and @xmath42 are taken as being proportional to @xmath46 and @xmath115 respectively , it can be easily shown that @xmath158 and @xmath159 depend mainly on the quantity @xmath160 and , to a minor extent , on the proportionality factors for @xmath47 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath154 represents the reduced mean critical field of the weak links , which depends on the intensity of the current density , @xmath116 , and on the flux compression factor , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , according to the present model , comparing the experimental data with the theoretical results allows the determination of @xmath154 as the main best - fit parameter , whose value is only little affected by the other two parameters @xmath47 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath157 can thus be taken as a quantity apt to characterize the `` strength '' of the weak - links ensemble and it is strongly dependent on the type of granular superconducting material .",
    "it has been observed that thermal treatments can produce strong changes in this quantity , leaving practically unaffected the superconducting properties of the grains , i.e. the critical temperature and the value of the magnetic field at which the flux begins to penetrate into the grains @xcite .    in conclusion , we have presented a simple model which is able to explain the anisotropy of the resistance shown by granular htscs in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the model can be applied if the intensity of the applied magnetic field is such that the bulk superconductivity is disrupted , but the grains remain in the superconducting state .",
    "this physical requirement is easily fulfilled in samples where the connections between grains is weak , as a result , for instance , of thermal treatments and annealing processes . in these conditions",
    ", we have shown that there is no need of assuming an intrinsic dependence of the intergrain resistivity on the angle between @xmath1 and @xmath3 , as instead the models based on the conventional theories of current - driven flux motion do .",
    "incidentally , the motion of unpinned vortices is actually the main origin of the resistance in those materials where the links between grains are so strong that the flux can penetrate into the grains and even become unpinned well before the resistive transition of the weak links sets in @xcite .",
    "if the material is made up of weakly linked grains , instead , the local magnetic field and the local current density in a given weak link are _ always _ perpendicular to each other , provided that the flux penetration into the grains is negligible . in this case the proposed model , which describes the anisotropy of the resistivity as being due to the spatially anisotropic distribution of the resistive weak links seems more appropriate . actually , the results of the model are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data obtained from resistance measurements in a ybco granular specimen which satisfies the above mentioned conditions .",
    "good experimental evidence is also found for the inverse proportionality between the mean critical field of the weak links and the current density , which is the basic assumption over which the proposed model has been developed .",
