    "the structure , rheology and phase behaviour of sterically stabilized colloidal dispersions are strongly affected by the presence of non adsorbing polymer .",
    "nearly fifty years ago asakura and oosawa realized that finite concentrations of polymer coils would induce an effective attraction between colloidal particles , of essentially _ entropic _ origin , the so - called depletion interaction @xcite .",
    "since the initial colloid - polymer hamiltonian involves only repulsive interactions between all pairs of particles , the polymer - induced effective attraction between colloids , which results from tracing out the polymer degrees of freedom , was referred to as `` attraction through repulsion '' by a. vrij . for non - interacting ( ideal )",
    "polymers , the range of the depletion attraction is independent of polymer concentration , and close to the polymer radius of gyration @xmath0 , while the depth of the attractive well , when two colloids touch , is proportional to polymer concentration .",
    "consequently , one expects that for sufficiently high concentration , and for not too small size ratio @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the radius of the spherical colloids ) , the effective attraction may drive a depletion - induced phase separation into colloid - rich ( `` liquid '' ) and colloid - poor ( `` gas '' ) colloidal dispersions , similar to condensation in simple fluids .",
    "this phase transition , which is in fact a colloid - polymer demixing transition , was investigated by gast _",
    "@xcite , who first calculated the phase diagram from thermodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "their findings were later confirmed by the monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations of meijer and frenkel @xcite , and the free volume theory of lekkerkerker _",
    "the predicted phase diagrams agree qualitatively with experimental findings for various colloid / polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "more recently the question was raised of how interactions between polymer coils would affect the phase behaviour compared to that of ideal polymers @xcite .",
    "the early theoretical investigations into the problem were made at the two - component level , involving an explicit consideration of the polymer coils .",
    "however very recently the depletion - driven effective pair - potential between two colloidal particles in a bath of interacting polymers in good solvent , modelled as self - avoiding walk ( saw ) polymers , was calculated by mc simulations @xcite . a simple analytic form , with coefficients determined by the saw polymer osmotic equation of state and surface tension , yields excellent agreement with the simulation data over a wide range of polymer to colloid size ratio @xmath3 , and polymer concentrations @xcite",
    ".    in this paper we use thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite to calculate the phase diagram of mixtures of hard sphere colloids and interacting polymers within the effective one - component representation , whereby the colloidal particles interact via the above - mentioned depletion potential induced by the saw polymers .",
    "the results of these calculations can be directly compared to the predictions of recent mc simulations of the two - component representation of the same system @xcite , which agree quantitatively with recent experiments @xcite .",
    "any discrepancies between the phase diagrams obtained within the effective one - component and two - component representations can then be traced back to more - than - two - body depletion interactions between colloidal particles , which are automatically included in the latter representation , but are of course neglected in the pairwise additive effective one - component picture considered in the present paper .",
    "thermodynamic perturbation theory was previously applied to mixtures of hard sphere colloids and ideal polymers within the effective one - component representation by gast _",
    "@xcite , and improved by dijkstra _",
    "similar calculations were recently published for mixtures of colloids and star polymers for several functionalities @xmath4 ( where @xmath4 is the number of identical arms of the star polymer connected at the centre ) , again within an effective one - component representation , as well as within the two - component description @xcite .",
    "star polymers are particularly instructive depletants , since upon varying the functionality , they change continuously from linear polymer ( @xmath5 ) to hard - sphere like behaviour ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the phase diagrams obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath5 are thus , in principle directly comparable to the results presented in this paper .",
    "such a comparison will be made in section @xmath7 , but is only tentative , since the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite neglect the polymer concentration - dependence of the effective colloid - polymer and the polymer - polymer interactions which are not negligible @xcite .",
    "consider a system of @xmath8 spherical colloidal particles of radius @xmath2 , in a bath of linear polymers which are in equilibrium with a polymer reservoir of fixed chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding semi - grand canonical description is schematically represented in figure [ semigrand.fig ] .",
    "the colloidal particles interact via the standard hard sphere potential , while each polymer is made up of @xmath10 monomers or segments ; segments from the same or different chains are not allowed to overlap . in good",
    "solvent , this excluded volume constraint is the only monomer - monomer interaction and for sufficiently large @xmath10 , where chemical details become irrelevant , the interacting polymers may be accurately modelled by self avoiding walks on a three - dimensional lattice .",
    "the monomers , moreover , are not allowed to penetrate the hard sphere colloids . at finite colloid and polymer concentrations",
    ", such a binary mixture of hard spheres and interacting polymers poses a formidable problem to theoreticians and simulators alike .",
    "one coarse - graining strategy which has proved very successful is to trace out individual monomer degrees of freedom in the `` polymers as soft colloids '' paradigm , whereby the total interaction between two polymer coils , averaged over all monomer configurations , reduces to an effective ( entropic ) interaction between their centres of mass , which depends on polymer concentration @xcite .",
    "similarly , one can trace out the monomer degrees of freedom , to derive a state - dependent effective interaction between the hard sphere colloids and the centres of mass of the polymer coils @xcite . this coarse - graining procedure , which amounts to a reduction of the number of degrees of freedom of each polymer from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , leads to a two - component representation of `` hard '' and effective `` soft '' colloids , which has been exploited in recent mc simulations to determine the phase diagram of colloid / interacting polymer mixtures for several size ratios @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". however , following the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) strategy for non - interacting polymers , one can carry the coarse - graining procedure one step further , by eliminating the polymer degrees of freedom altogether and determining the resulting depletion interactions between the colloidal particles .",
    "if this procedure is carried out in the semi - grand canonical ensemble , the total effective interaction energy between @xmath8 colloidal particles for any configuration @xmath13 is : @xmath14>_{\\mu_{p},v , t}(\\vec{r}^{n_{c}})\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the direct colloid - colloid interaction energy , while @xmath16 is the total colloid - polymer interaction ; the brackets denote a grand - canonical average over polymer degrees of freedom at fixed polymer chemical potential , volume and temperature , and a given colloid configuration . in the model under consideration , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the colloid - colloid and colloid - monomer excluded volume interactions , which are pair - wise additive .",
    "the depletion interactions between the @xmath8 colloidal particles are given by the second term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ veff ] ) and are not , a priori , pair - wise additive",
    ". however , for sufficiently low colloid concentration , or small size ratio @xmath3 , the pair - wise additive contribution dominates .",
    "the depletion pair potential between an isolated pair of colloidal spheres has been determined as a function of the centre - to - centre distance , and over a range of interacting polymer concentrations covering the dilute and semi - dilute regimes , in ref .",
    "the resulting depletion pair potential is accurately reproduced by the following simple semi - empirical form , inspired by the derjaguin approximation @xcite : @xmath17 @xmath18 is the centre - to - centre separation , while @xmath19 is the surface - to - surface distance between the colloids ; @xmath20 is the polymer surface tension near a planar wall , a function of polymer bulk concentration @xmath21 determined in ref .",
    "@xcite for saw polymers ; @xmath22 is the range of the depletion potential given , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the osmotic pressure of the interacting polymers taken from renormalization group calculations @xcite , namely :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath0 is the polymer radius of gyration at zero density ( @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 \\right]\\ ] ]    the second fraction on the r.h.s of ( [ range.eq ] ) accounts for finite curvature of the colloid surface , as estimated approximately from the ao model for ideal polymers @xcite : @xmath30 which reduces to @xmath31 in the limit @xmath32 .      for comparative purposes , we also consider the depletion pair potential induced by ideal polymers .",
    "meijer and frenkel @xcite showed that to a good approximation this is well represented by the asakura - oosawa form @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the radius of a sphere around the colloids from which the interpenetrable polymers are excluded , but with an effective @xmath35 calculated from the insertion free energy of a single colloid in a bath of ideal polymer .",
    "the radius is given by eq .",
    "( [ raoeff.eq ] ) @xcite ; for a hard wall it reduces to @xmath36 , while it monotonically decreases for increasing size ratio @xmath3 since the polymer can deform around the spherical colloid . for the size ratios considered here",
    "the curvature effects are small , on the order of a few @xmath37 @xcite . + the two pair potentials ( [ louis.eq ] ) and ( [ ao.eq ] ) are always attractive",
    ". for interacting polymers the range decreases with increasing polymer concentration @xmath38 , while the latter is constant for ideal polymers .",
    "furthermore , at any given @xmath38 , the depth of @xmath39 is always less than that of @xmath40 , so that the depletion attraction induced by interacting polymers is weaker than for ideal polymers .",
    "representative examples of the depletion potentials ( [ louis.eq ] ) are shown in figure  [ potentiels.fig ] .",
    "our objective is to draw phase diagrams of colloid / polymer mixtures in the ( @xmath41,@xmath42 ) plane , where @xmath43 is the colloid packing fraction , while @xmath44 is the ratio of the polymer density in the reservoir ( @xmath18 ) over the overlap density @xmath45 ; the latter conventionally separates the dilute ( @xmath46 ) and the semi - dilute ( @xmath47 ) regimes . to this end",
    "we need to calculate the free energies of the various phases . within the semi - grand canonical ensemble",
    "the required free energy is related to the helmholtz free energy @xmath48 by a legendre transformation : @xmath49 since the colloidal particles interact via a hard sphere repulsion and an effective , depletion - driven attraction , the natural way forward is to calculate the free energies of the various phases from thermodynamic perturbation theory , using the well - documented hard sphere fluid as a reference system @xcite . to second order in the high - temperature expansion : @xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the free energy of the hard sphere fluid , @xmath52 denotes an average over the reference system configurations , and @xmath53 is the perturbation potential energy : @xmath54 with @xmath55 , the distance between the centres of colloids @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; @xmath58 is the polymer concentration - dependent depletion potential ( [ louis.eq ] ) for interacting polymers ( @xmath59 ) or ( [ ao.eq ] ) for non - interacting polymers ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we stress that within the semi - grand canonical description the depletion potential must be calculated for the polymer density in the reservoir , which is unequivocally determined by fixing the chemical potential @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ pert.eq ] ) is calculated from the carnahan and starling equation of state for the hard sphere fluid @xcite while for the hard sphere solid we adopt hall s equation of state @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 is easily expressed in terms of the hard sphere pair distribution function @xmath63 for which we adopted the verlet - weis parametrisation in the fluid @xcite , and the form proposed by kincaid and weis for the fcc solid phase @xcite .",
    "the calculation of @xmath64 involves three and four - body contributions of the reference system .",
    "we have adopted the approximate expression due to barker and henderson @xcite , which only involves the pair distribution function and the compressibility of the reference system .",
    "gathering results : @xmath65 note that in the solid phase , @xmath63 is the orientationally - averaged pair distribution function .    in order to assess the accuracy of @xmath64 and the convergence of the perturbation series ( [ perturb.eq ] ) , we have carried out mc simulations to compute explicitly the fluctuation term in eq .",
    "( [ pert.eq ] ) , which is approximated by the last term in eq .",
    "( [ perturb.eq ] ) , as well as the total excess free energy .",
    "the latter is most conveniently calculated by the standard @xmath66-integration procedure @xcite , whereby the depletion - induced perturbation @xmath53 is gradually switched on , resulting in : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the required free energy of the fully interacting colloid / polymer mixture , @xmath69 is the free energy of the hard sphere reference system , and @xmath70 is the statistical average of the perturbation weighted by the boltzmann factor appropriate for a system of particles interacting via the hard sphere repulsion and the partially switched on depletion potential @xmath71 .",
    "the calculation of the free energy @xmath72 hence involves several mc simulations to determine @xmath70 for a series of discrete values of @xmath66@xcite , typically @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the convergence of the perturbation series ( [ perturb.eq ] ) is illustrated in figure [ f1f2color.fig ] for the depletion potential ( [ louis.eq ] ) and a size ratio @xmath75 .",
    "as expected , the convergence of the series is faster when the size ratio @xmath3 is larger , the polymer concentration is lower and the colloid packing fraction higher . + the accuracy of each term in the series , and of the truncated sum ,",
    "were tested by mc simulations of periodic samples of @xmath76 colloidal particles .",
    "representative results are presented in tables i and ii .",
    "table i shows that values of @xmath62 from eq .",
    "( [ perturb.eq ] ) are very close to the simulation data , both for the fluid and the solid .",
    "the barker - henderson approximation underestimates the absolute value of @xmath64 , by less than a factor of two in the fluid phase , and by a much larger factor in the fcc crystal phase , where it is totally inadequate .",
    "however , as shown in table ii , the sum of the first three terms of the perturbation series ( [ perturb.eq ] ) yields a total free energy which is surprisingly close to the `` exact '' mc results from the @xmath66-integration .",
    "similar comparisons show that the predictions of perturbation theory are very reliable both for larger and for somewhat smaller values of @xmath3 ( say for @xmath77 ) , but that the predictions rapidly deteriorate for small @xmath3 , corresponding to narrow potential wells , as expected .",
    "this failure will be illustrated in the case @xmath78 at the end of the following section .",
    "once the free energies of the fluid and fcc solid phases have been calculated from thermodynamic perturbation theory , as explained in the previous section , the phase diagrams can be calculated using the standard double - tangent construction . since the initial two - component system is athermal , the depletion potentials ( [ louis.eq ] ) and ( [ ao.eq ] ) are purely entropic , so that the temperature scales out in the boltzmann factor , and the resulting phase diagrams are independent of temperature .",
    "the phase diagrams for mixtures of colloids and interacting polymers in the ( @xmath41,@xmath42 ) plane are shown in figure [ pert-int.fig ] for four values of the size ratio @xmath3 , in the range @xmath79 .",
    "the phase diagrams look superficially similar to earlier results obtained for mixtures of colloids and ideal polymers @xcite or star polymers @xcite . in particular , for the smaller size ratios , the fluid - fluid phase separation is metastable , and preempted by phase coexistence between a high density solid and a single low density fluid phase .",
    "such a behaviour is a typical signature of `` narrow '' potential wells like those pictured in figure [ potentiels.fig ] @xcite . for larger size ratios a stable fluid - fluid phase separation appears with a critical point and a triple point , and the resulting phase diagrams",
    "are not unlike those of simple atomic systems in the density - temperature plane ( with @xmath80 playing the role of @xmath81 ) .",
    "the corresponding phase diagrams for mixtures of colloids and ideal polymers , calculated using the ideal depletion potential ( [ ao.eq ] ) are shown figure [ pert-ao.fig ] for comparison . while they look qualitatively similar to those for interacting polymers in figure [ pert-int.fig ] , there are a number of striking quantitative differences . because the depletion attraction for ideal polymers ( eq . [ ao.eq ] ) is stronger than that for interacting polymers ( eq .",
    "( [ louis.eq ] ) ) for the same polymer concentration , the fluid - fluid phase separation becomes stable at a larger @xmath42 for the interacting than for the non - interacting polymers . while the phase diagrams for @xmath82 are fairly close , the differences grow with increasing @xmath3 . for @xmath83 the critical point in figure [ pert-ao.fig ] ( ideal case )",
    "is at ( @xmath84,@xmath85 ) compared to ( 0.25,1.21 ) in the interacting case , while the triple points are at ( 0.47,0.92 ) and ( 0.43,1.42 ) respectively , indicating dramatic changes when going from ideal to interacting polymers .",
    "also note that while the critical polymer concentration is practically independent of @xmath3 ( for @xmath86 ) in the ideal case , it shifts to higher values as @xmath3 increases in the interacting case . on the other hand ,",
    "the critical colloid packing fraction decreases as @xmath3 increases in the non - interacting case , while it is practically constant for interacting polymers .",
    "all these trends are similar to those reported recently in simulations of the two - component description of mixtures of colloids and saw polymers @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison between the present perturbation theory results for the effective one - component system , and the phase diagrams determined for the two - component representation is made in figure [ pert-sim22.fig ] .",
    "the agreement between the simulation data for the two - component representation and the predictions of perturbation theory for the effective one - component representation is seen to be reasonable , but not perfect , and to deteriorate as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the obvious reason is that perturbation theory only includes the pair - wise additive part of the depletion interactions , while the two - component representation also accounts for effective many - body depletion interactions between colloidal particles .",
    "the fact that the phase diagrams obtained from the two - component representation are shifted to lower polymer concentrations relative to the prediction for the effective one - component system indicates that the more - than - two - body depletion interactions are overall attractive in nature along phase boundaries ( see e.g.  the work of dijkstra _ et al._@xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the many - body interactions are slightly more attractive than would be inferred from figure  [ pert-sim22.fig ] . ] .",
    "the opposite trend was found in the case of ideal polymers @xcite , and is consistent with the more pronounced trends in the limit of large @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we pointed out earlier that the convergence of thermodynamic perturbation theory is expected to deteriorate when the range of the attractive potential well decreases , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath3 decreases . to check the reliability of second order perturbation theory at @xmath87 ,",
    "we have systematically computed the `` exact '' free energy by mc simulations , using the @xmath66-integration ( eq .",
    "( [ lambdaint.eq ] ) ) .",
    "the phase diagrams determined with the approximate and `` exact '' free energies are compared in figure [ pert-sim1.fig ] .",
    "the agreement remains acceptable for the fluid - solid transition , even for @xmath82 , but the ( metastable ) critical point of the fluid - fluid transition is at too high a colloid packing fraction@xcite .",
    "two - component simulations@xcite would be very expensive for small @xmath3 , because the number of polymers needed scales as @xmath88 .",
    "however , for sufficiently small @xmath3 we do nt expect many - body interactions to be important , and so our one - component simulation should accurately represent the true colloid / polymer system .    a final instructive comparison is between the present results for the phase behaviour of colloid / interacting polymer mixtures and the results for colloid / star polymer mixtures of functionality @xmath5@xcite , which reduce in fact to interacting linear polymers considered in the present work .",
    "the phase diagrams calculated from both depletion potentials within the same approximation ( [ perturb.eq ] ) for the free energies are compared in figure [ compstarf2.fig ] for similar size ratios @xmath3 .",
    "although , as explained earlier in this paper , the depletion pair potential calculated for the @xmath5 star polymers @xcite is not quite the same as the more accurate one we use@xcite , the phase - diagrams show the similar trends when compared to ideal polymers .",
    "we have shown that traditional thermodynamic perturbation theory , requiring only the well - documented equations of state and pair distribution functions of the fluid and solid phases of the reference hard sphere system , leads to reasonably accurate phase diagrams of mixtures of colloidal particles and _ interacting _ polymer coils , provided the appropriate concentration - dependent depletion potential between two colloidal spheres is used . as expected , the agreement between the predictions of the effective one - component description , and the more elaborate two - component description observed for low size ratios @xmath3 deteriorates as @xmath3 increases , due to the enhanced importance of many - body interaction which are neglected in the one - component picture . nevertheless , the disagreement remains tolerable even at @xmath89 , and in view of the excellent agreement between the predictions of the two - component description @xcite and recent experimental data @xcite , we conclude that the effective one - component picture , in conjunction with standard thermodynamic perturbation theory , provides a reliable prediction of the phase diagrams of colloids / polymer mixtures in good solvent .",
    "a direct comparison between the phase diagrams for interacting and ideal polymers calculated at the same level of approximation shows considerable quantitative , and even qualitative differences between the two depletants .",
    "the main effect of polymer - polymer interactions is to enhance the miscibility of the colloid / polymer mixtures .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by a number of different recent investigations , based on two - component approaches , including integral equations@xcite , `` polymers as soft colloids''@xcite , extensions of free - volume theory@xcite , density functional theory@xcite , and star - polymer potentials@xcite . here",
    "we show that the differences between the two types of depletants can be rationalised within a one - component effective potential picture , mainly because for a given @xmath90 and density @xmath91 , the depletion potentials for interaction polymers are less attractive than those for interacting polymers .",
    "the results of the present work apply to polymers in good solvent , for which the saw model constitutes an excellent representation .",
    "we plan to examine the situation where solvent quality is such that attractive forces between monomers can no longer be neglected @xcite . upon lowering the temperature from very high ( corresponding to the saw limit ) to the @xmath92 temperature",
