    "one of the more striking features of this boundary law is the occurrence of a subleading constant contribution that for a smooth boundary , i.e. one without any sharp corners , is independent of the size or the geometry of the bipartition and thus indicates long - range entanglement .",

    "in contrast to a conventionally ordered or entirely disordered system , the states on the boundary of a topologically ordered system are found to be subtly constrained which then leads to a non - trivial entropic contribution of this boundary .",
    "we will discuss details of both perspectives in the remainder of the manuscript .    despite the obvious fact that classical systems do not exhibit any entanglement , the notion of the entanglement entropy has a straight - forward companion for classical statistical systems  the shannon entropy , which we can analogously define for a bipartition of the system as illustrated in fig .",

    "the occurrence of a non - vanishing constant term @xmath23 in this volume law for the classical shannon entropy is again tightly connected to the occurrence of long - range information in the classical system .",
    "a prototypical family of such classical systems exhibiting long - range information are classical variants of so - called stringnet states , which we will introduce and discuss in much detail in the following .",
    "the main result of this manuscript is that for this broad variety of classical systems we establish a universal equation relating the constant term @xmath23 to a characteristic feature of the topological field theory underlying these stringnet states .",

    "in quantum mechanics , one of the most important measures of entanglement in a system of multiple quantum mechanical degrees of freedom is the entanglement entropy .",
    "we will briefly recap this notion in the following and then turn to the classical analogs of these concepts .",
    "let us consider a quantum system with ground state @xmath26 and a bipartition along a smooth cut ( without any sharp corners ) that divides the system into two parts called @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as already outlined in the introduction we can characterize the entanglement of the two partitions by calculating the reduced density matrix of one of the two partitions , say partition @xmath5 , by tracing out the other one to obtain @xmath27 we can now readily diagonalize this reduced density matrix to obtain its eigenvalues @xmath28 , which are the probabilities to find system @xmath5 in the quantum state corresponding to the respective eigenvector . in terms of these eigenvalues ,",
    "the entanglement entropy can thus be readily calculated as @xmath29 note that for a quantum system the so - calculated entanglement entropies @xmath30 and @xmath31 are equal , i.e. @xmath32 .      to identify a classical analog to the entanglement entropy we note that the definition of the entanglement entropy in the form of eq .",

    ", we can replace the quantum mechanical probabilities @xmath28 to find the system in a certain state @xmath33 by their classical counterparts to find subsystem @xmath5 in a particular classical configuration @xmath34 .",
    "the classical analog of the entanglement entropy is then simply given by the well - known shannon entropy @xmath35 where the sum now runs over the set of all possible configurations @xmath17 of subsystem @xmath5 .",
    "similar to the quantum mechanical case , the probability of a given classical configuration @xmath34 is obtained by summing over all possible complementary configurations in partition @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the energy of the configuration in the full system , @xmath38 is the boltzmann factor , and @xmath39 the temperature .",
    "note that in general the classical shannon entropy is not equivalent for the two partitions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath40 .    instead of directly calculating the shannon entropy",

    "more interesting is the presence of the subleading constant term @xmath13 , which is often called topological entropy and is robust against changing the microscopic details of the system . for a smooth cut it does neither depend on any length scale of the system nor the geometry of the bipartition and as such must be rooted in long - range entanglement . the seminal work of refs .",
    "@xcite showed that the topological entropy is universal and can be directly calculated from the total quantum dimension @xmath15 of the effective topological field theory .",
    "in particular , it is given by @xmath49 .",
    "as the topological entropy is subleading , it is often cumbersome to determine it to sufficient accuracy by doing a scaling analysis , though recent numerical investigations have been quite successful in doing so @xcite .",
    "in addition , there may be additional @xmath50 contributions to @xmath30 arising from sharp corners in the cut .",
    "thus , it is beneficial to use a setup , which was introduced by levin and wen @xcite , to extract the topological entropy from a set of different bipartitions of the system as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : levinwencuts ] . by considering the four different bipartitions of fig .",

    "note again that a direct consequence of this volume law is that the shannon entropy is in general not symmetric with regard to the two partitions , i.e. @xmath40 . similar to the quantum case , we can also in the classical system identify a constant contribution @xmath23 , which reduces the entropy .",
    "this constant turns out to be independent of the geometry and size of the system , which is why we will call it ` classical topological entropy ' . as we will discuss in the subsequent sections",

    "one subtle difference to the quantum mechanical calculation is that in the classical case the topological correction @xmath23 is sensitive to the number of disconnected regions in partition @xmath6 . as an example",
    ", we show the constant contributions to the entropy for a quantum system and its related classical system for the four levin - wen partitions in fig .",
    "[ fig : levinwenpartitions ] .",
    "the first line indicates the topological entanglement entropy for the quantum mechanical system , the example being the so - called toric code model @xcite , which has total quantum dimension @xmath58 .",
    "note that in the quantum mechanical case the topological correction for a given bipartition is related to the number of boundaries between parts @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; the bipartitions involving @xmath59 and @xmath60 contribute twice the value than those bipartitions involving @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the classical analog of the toric code is the so - called loopgas at @xmath63 , whose classical topological entropy was already studied in ref .",

    "note that the classical value is independent of the number of boundaries but instead measures the number of disconnected regions in the complementary part .",
    "for instance , the topological @xmath50 contribution in @xmath30 is non - vanishing only if part @xmath6 is disconnected .",
    "finally note that the similar setup introduced by kitaev and preskill @xcite for extracting the topological entropy is not suitable for the classical systems considered here , because all bi - partitions have connected parts @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as an example family of model systems exhibiting non - trivial topological order , we will consider so - called stringnet states and in particular their classical analogs .",

    "the most elementary building block for both the quantum and classical versions of stringnets are so - called su(2)@xmath0 anyon theories @xcite .",

    "we can combine two representations of su(2)@xmath0 into one joint representation  similar to combining two spin quantum numbers into one joint spin quantum number for conventional su(2 ) spins .",

    "the quantum double construction of levin and wen creates a lattice model from an anyonic theory , such as one of the su(2)@xmath0 anyon theories introduced in the previous section .",
    "the elementary constituents of the lattice model are edges that carry an anyonic degree of freedom , which is captured by the respective anyon theory , i.e. it corresponds to one of the labels @xmath91 .",
    "the bonds form a lattice via _ trivalent _ vertices .",
    "an example of a particularly regular lattice construction would be the honeycomb lattice , which we will use in all visualizations in the following . at each vertex",

    "]    forming an entire graph out of a set of these allowed vertices and corresponding edges , one can then create a multitude of lattice configurations . by visual inspection of these configurations",
    "it becomes evident how the vertex constraints translate into constraints of the overall lattice configurations .",
    "for the case of the su(2)@xmath1 anyonic theory , which contains only abelian anyons , the resulting configurations will consist of closed loops only , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : loopgas ] . introducing a non - abelian anyon into the anyon theory ,",
    "as it is the case for , e.g. the fibonacci theory , the resulting lattice configurations also include branches resulting in netlike configurations as illustrated in fig .  [",

    "the set of allowed lattice configurations forms a basis for the part of the hilbert space , where the groundstate resides in . before moving on to the construction of the classical analog of these quantum states ,",
    "we want to mention in passing a few additional constraints present in the quantum model ( but not the classical model to be introduced in the next section ) .",
    "most notable for the remainder of this manuscript is that a subset of allowed lattice configurations has vanishing weight for the groundstate , in particular all those configurations where the netlike configuration includes so - called tadpoles illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : stringnettadpole ] . the actual weight of an allowed lattice configuration will be finely tuned by a number of parameters depending on the specifics of the underlying anyon theory ( such as , e.g. , a @xmath92-isotopy parameter for the inclusion of closed loops ) .",
    "further , the levin - wen construction goes beyond the construction of quantum ground states , but also allows a description of excited states , e.g. states where the vertex constraint is not fulfilled at individual vertices or which include one of the aforementioned tadpoles .",
    "finally we note that in more mathematical terms , the quantum double construction is routed in the so - called drinfeld double @xcite , which takes a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) @xmath93 and its time - reversal conjugate @xmath94 to construct a doubled tqft that is time - reversal invariant @xcite . for more details on this construction the reader",
    "is referred to the original math literature @xcite or the more physical introduction in ref .",
    "note that the total quantum dimension of the quantum double model is the square of the total quantum dimension of the anyonic theory , i.e. @xmath95 , resulting in a topological entropy @xmath96 .",
    "we now turn to the classical analogs of the quantum mechanical stringnet states introduced as groundstates of the quantum double construction of levin and wen in the previous section .",
    "to do so , we first note that the quantum ground states of levin and wen can generally be written as a superposition of stringnet configurations @xmath97 , which fulfill the vertex constraints at every single vertex .",
    "the wavefunction can then be expressed as @xmath98 where the coefficients @xmath99 are real , but not necessarily all positive or non - zero @xcite .",

    "in fact , one can explicitly count the number of allowed configurations contributing to the partition function .",
    "going through a sequence of combinatorial steps ( detailed in appendix [ sec : stringnet ] ) , one finds that @xmath102=\\sum_{j=0}^k \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{d}}{d_j}\\right)^v \\approx 2\\mathcal{d}^v \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath84 indicate the quantum dimension of the anyons in the underlying anyon theory su(2)@xmath0 and @xmath15 is the total quantum dimension of the theory . in the large - volume limit",
