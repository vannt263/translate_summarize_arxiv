    "in semiconductor superlattices the electric transport is dominated by resonances between the localized energy levels inside the wells .",
    "a resonance structure appears in the current - voltage characteristics if the energy levels of different wells align@xcite . between these resonances regions with negative differential conductivity ( ndc ) are likely to appear . this yields interesting current - voltage characteristics as already shown by esaki and chang @xcite .",
    "if the voltage applied along the growth direction of the superlattice yields an average field which is in the ndc region , the homogeneous field distribution breaks up and electric field domains form causing many current branches in the current - voltage characteristic ( almost equal to the number of quantum wells ) . this has been extensively studied experimentally during the last decade @xcite .",
    "theoretically the complicated measured @xmath0 characteristics could be reproduced using models based on the combination of rate equations between the wells and poisson s equation @xcite .",
    "these models used simplified expressions for the tunnelling current between the wells @xcite , or a fitted local current - field characteristics @xcite .",
    "a theoretical approach for the transport in superlattices with strong coupling between the wells has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite with the restriction to one miniband .",
    "this restriction is not appropriate for situations where high field domains occur , as they are close to the resonance between the first and the second subband @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , no quantitative calculations have been performed so far .",
    "the aforementioned theories for domain formation showed that the electric field as well as the carrier density are almost constant within the field domains .",
    "thus the current density is determined by intrinsic features of the superlattice .",
    "this is a much simpler situation than in many other semiconductor structures , such as the double - barrier resonant - tunnelling diode , where the contacts strongly influence the field profile and the current densities by carrier injection .",
    "furthermore the single branches extend up to a current density , where the low field domain reaches the maximum of the current - field relation .",
    "therefore the current maxima of the branches are a good estimate for the maximum in the current - field relation , which does not depend strongly on the contacts .",
    "the situation becomes slightly more complicated , if the superlattice exhibits fluctuation in its parameters , which have a strong impact impact on the individual branches @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a unified microscopic theory , without adjustable parameters , to describe the underlying current - field relation .",
    "in contrast to the situation considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the situation of weakly coupled quantum wells ( @xmath1 ) where @xmath2 is the coupling between the wells and @xmath3 is the broadening of the levels within the single wells .",
    "this means that the intrawell scattering rate is larger than the tunnelling rate .",
    "this is relevant to most experiments including that described in ref .",
    "@xcite with which we will compare our results .",
    "we consider weakly coupled semiconductor quantum wells of period @xmath4 .",
