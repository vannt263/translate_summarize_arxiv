    "recently , we have made theoretical progress in the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach to heavy - to - light decays , such as the proof of @xmath1 factorization theorem @xcite , the construction of power counting rules for various topologies of decay amplitudes @xcite , the derivation of @xmath1 and threshold resummations @xcite , and the application to heavy baryon decays @xcite and to three - body nonleptonic decays @xcite .",
    "important dynamics in the decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 has been explored , including penguin enhancement and large cp asymmetries @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate to what extent this formalism can be generalized to charmful decays , such as the semileptonic decay @xmath21 and the nonleptonic decay @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath1 factorization theorem for the @xmath0 form factors in the large - recoil region of the @xmath5 meson can be proved following the procedure in @xcite , which are expressed as the convolution of hard amplitudes with @xmath3 and @xmath5 meson wave functions . a hard amplitude , being infrared - finite , is calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath5 meson wave functions , collecting the infrared divergences in the decays , are not calculable but universal .",
    "the @xmath0 transitions are more complicated than the @xmath22 ones , because they involve three scales : the @xmath3 meson mass @xmath4 , the @xmath5 meson mass @xmath6 , and the heavy meson and heavy quark mass difference @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) quark mass , and @xmath7 of order of the qcd scale @xmath28 .",
    "there are several interesting topics in the large - recoil region of the @xmath0 transitions .",
    "( 1 ) how to construct reasonable power counting rules for these decays with the three scales ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the qualitative behavior of the wave function for an energetic @xmath5 meson ? is it dominated by soft dynamics the same as a @xmath3 meson wave function , or by collinear dynamics the same as a pion wave function ? ( 3 ) how different are the end - point singularities in the @xmath0 form factors from those in the @xmath22 ones ?",
    "( 4 ) what is the effect of sudakov ( @xmath1 and threshold ) resummation in the @xmath0 form factors ? ( 5 ) how are the relations for the @xmath0 form factors in the heavy - quark limit modified by the finite @xmath3 and @xmath5 meson masses ? ( 6 ) what is the hard scale for the @xmath0 transitions ? is it large enough to make sense out of perturbative evaluation of hard amplitudes ? these questions will be answered in this work .",
    "we attempt to develop pqcd formalism for the @xmath21 decays in the heavy - quark and large - recoil limits based on @xmath1 factorization theorem @xcite .",
    "we argue that the following hierachy must be postulated : @xmath29 the relation @xmath30 justifies the perturbative analysis of the @xmath0 form factors at large recoil and the definition of light - cone @xmath5 meson wave functions .",
    "the relation @xmath31 justifies the power expansion in the parameter @xmath32 .",
    "we shall calculate the @xmath0 form factors as double expansions in @xmath33 and in @xmath32 .",
    "the small ratio @xmath34 is regarded as being of higher power . whether the hierachy is reasonable",
    "can be examined by the convergence of high - order corrections in the strong coupling constant @xmath35 and of higher - power corrections in @xmath9 and in @xmath10 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) differs from the small - velocity limit considered in @xcite , where the ratio @xmath33 is treated as being of @xmath36 .    under the hierachy , the wave function for an energetic @xmath5 meson absorbs collinear dynamics , but with the @xmath27 quark line being eikonalized",
    "that is , its definition is a mixture of those for a @xmath3 meson dominated by soft dynamics and for a pion dominated by collinear dynamics .",
    "we examine the behavior of the heavy meson wave functions in the heavy - quark and large - recoil limits . for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , only a single @xmath3 meson wave function @xmath39 and a single @xmath5 meson wave function @xmath40 are involved in the @xmath0 form factors , @xmath41 being the momentum fraction associated with the light spectator quark .",
    "equations of motion for the relevant nonlocal matrix elements imply that @xmath39 and @xmath40 exhibit maxima at @xmath42 and at @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "since pqcd is reliable in the large - recoil region , it is powerful for the study of two - body nonleptonic @xmath3 meson decays . after determining the @xmath5 meson wave function ( the @xmath3 meson and pion wave functions have beed fixed in our previous works )",
    ", we can make predictions for the @xmath13 decays .",
    "preliminary results for the @xmath44 modes will be presented in sec .",
    "similar to the heavy - to - light transitions , the @xmath0 form factors also suffer singularities from the end - point region with a momentum fraction @xmath45 in collinear factorization theorem .",
    "when the end - point region is important , the parton transverse momenta @xmath1 are not negligible , and @xmath1 factorization is a tool more appropriate than collinear factorization . it has been proved that predictions for a physical quantity derived from @xmath1 factorization are gauge - invariant @xcite . because of the inclusion of parton transverse degrees of freedom , the large double logarithmic corrections @xmath46 appear and should be summed to all orders .",
    "it turns out that the resultant sudakov factor for an energetic @xmath5 meson is similar to that for a @xmath3 meson . including the sudakov effects from @xmath1 resummation and from threshold resummation for hard amplitudes @xcite ,",
    "the end - point singularities do not exist , and soft contributions can be suppressed effectively .",
    "we shall identify the leading - power and next - to - leading - power ( down by @xmath9 or by @xmath10 ) contributions to the @xmath0 form factors , which are equivalent to the expansion in heavy quark effective theory @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that the leading - power factorization formulas satisfy the heavy - quark relations defined in terms of the isgur - wise ( iw ) function @xcite .",
    "these contributions are characterized by the scale @xmath8 , indicating that the applicability of pqcd to the @xmath0 form factors may be marginal .",
    "the next - to - leading - power corrections to the heavy - quark relations , characterized by a scale larger than @xmath11 , can be evaluated more reliablly .",
    "these corrections amount only up to 20% of the leading contribution , indicating that the power expansion in @xmath9 and in @xmath10 works well .",
    "it should be stressed that the above percentage is only indicative , since we have not yet been able to explore the complete next - to - leading - power sources with the current poor knowledge of nonperturbative inputs .    in sec .",

    "though the @xmath5 meson wave function absorbs the collinear configuration , similar to the pion wave function , the heavy - quark expansion applies to the @xmath27 quark in the same way as to the @xmath26 quark in a @xmath3 meson .",
    "this is the reason we claim that the energetic @xmath5 meson dynamics is a mixture of those of the @xmath3 meson at rest and of the energetic pion . because @xmath80 is much larger than @xmath81 according to eq .",

    "the physics involved in the above approximation is that the kinematics of the spectator quark and of the @xmath27 quark is dramatically different in the limit @xmath85 .",
