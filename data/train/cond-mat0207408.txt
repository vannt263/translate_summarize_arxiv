    "moving charge carriers in a conductor exert a coulomb force on the charge carriers in a nearby conductor and induce a drag current in the latter via momentum transfer .",
    "this phenomenon , known as coulomb drag , was predicted by pogrebinskii in his pioneering paper @xcite in which he argued that in a structure of two semiconductor layers separated by an insulating layer , there would be a drag of carriers in layer 1 ( `` drag layer '' ) , resulting in a drag current @xmath4 , _ _ due to the direct coulomb interaction with the carriers in layer 2 ( `` drive layer '' ) , where an electric current @xmath5 flows .",
    "if no current is allowed to flow in the drag layer , the charge carriers will accumulate at one end inducing a charge imbalance across the layer .",
    "this charge will continue to accumulate until the force of the resulting electric field balances the drag force . in the stationary state",
    "there will be an induced or ` drag ' voltage @xmath6 in the drag layer . when the carriers in both layers are of the same type ( electrons or holes ) , the drag voltage has a sign opposite to the voltage drop in the drive layer .",
    "figure [ fig - schematic ] gives a schematic view of coulomb drag between two parallel quantum wires .",
    "the quantity usually measured in experiments is the drag voltage @xmath6 . the drag resistance @xmath7 is defined as @xmath7 = -@xmath6 /@xmath5 .",
    "coulomb drag between two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems has been extensively studied @xcite both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the basic physics involved in the description of the drag in two dimensions is now well understood on the basis of fermi liquid ( fl ) theory of interacting fermions .",
    "the fl theory is well established in three dimensions , holds marginally for many two - dimensional systems , but generally fails in one - dimension .",
    "the theory is based on landau s conjecture that the low - lying excitations of interacting fermion systems can be connected continuously to those of the non - interacting fermi gas  there is a smooth mapping between the quasiparticles of the interacting and of the non - interacting system @xcite .",
    "coulomb drag between one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron systems has been the focus of considerable interest in recent years because our understanding of the quantum properties in interacting 1d systems is unsatisfactory .",
    "experimental work on the subject remains quite limited @xcite , a fair number of theoretical papers have been published @xcite .",
    "the primary reason for this theoretical interest is that coulomb drag is one of the most effective ways to study electron - electron ( e - e ) interaction .",
    "it is now theoretically established that in an interacting 1d electron gas of infinite length the e - e - interaction completely modifies the ground state of the system .",
    "the elementary excitations can not be treated as non - interacting quasiparticles of a conventional fermi liquid , but instead acquire a bosonic nature .",
    "an adequate theoretical description of these interacting 1d systems can be done in terms of the so - called luttinger - liquid ( ll ) @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) , complementary to the fl description in higher dimensions . in a real 1d system of finite length at finite temperatures , the extent of influence of the e - e interaction",
    "will depend on the system parameters .",
    "experimental efforts to observe manifestation of luttinger liquid behavior , however , have been quite limited @xcite .",
    "part of the problem is that the ( e - e ) interaction has little influence on the conductance of a single wire , since the current is proportional to the total electron quasi - momentum , which is conserved in electron - electron collisions . to look for experimental evidence of the ll state",
    "it would therefore help to explore a new experimental tool based on new devices and physical phenomena .",
    "coulomb drag between 1d electron systems in a dual - wire configuration and opens up a new opportunity and avenue for experimentally probing the ll state in a 1d electron system .",
    "the purpose of this review paper is to present the current status of the theory of coulomb drag between 1d electron systems for electron transport in the ballistic regime , and to report on experimental measurements of the 1d drag effect .",
    "ballistic transport takes place when the quantum wire dimensions are smaller than both the elastic and the inelastic scattering lengths .",
    "electron transport is strictly one dimensional when only the lowest 1d subband of the wire is occupied and transport takes place in the fundamental mode .",
    "the ballistic regime is well suited for coulomb drag study , since in this regime other scattering processes , such as impurity and phonon scattering , are either insignificant or totally absent .",
    "further theoretical and experimental investigation of the 1d coulomb drag effect can enhance our general understanding of the properties of systems of low dimensionality .",
    "this broad class of systems is currently a very active area of research .",
    "in addition to its fundamental interest , a comprehensive understanding of coulomb interaction between quantum wires is expected to play a significant role in the design of nanodevices , such as single - electron transistors ( sets ) @xcite and quantum cellular automata ( qca ) @xcite , which are comprised of quantum dots and quantum wires in close proximity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec - fermi ] describes the theory of 1d coulomb drag based on the fermi liquid approach .",
    "section [ sec - luttinger ] reviews the luttinger liquid description of this effect . in section [ sec - exp ]",
    "is presented a summary of the experimental work reported so far and a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results using both the fl and the ll descriptions of 1d coulomb drag .",
    "finally , section [ sec - future ] gives some guidelines for future work on the subject .",
    "in this section the 1d coulomb drag is analyzed within the fermi - liquid concept .",
    "we will follow refs .",
    "@xcite and use the physical picture developed by landauer  @xcite , imry  @xcite , and bttiker  @xcite .",
    "we assume that each quantum wire is connected to ideal electronic reservoirs attached to its ends .",
    "the relaxation processes in the reservoirs are considered to be so fast that each of them is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the e - e interaction within a single quantum wire does not result in a current variation because of the quasimomentum conservation in the e - e collisions .",
    "however , if two such wires , 1 and 2 are near one another and are parallel , the coulomb interaction of electrons belonging to different wires can transfer momenta between the wires , which eventually gives rise to a drag effect .    the drag force due to the ballistic current in wire 2 creates a sort of permanent acceleration on the electrons of wire 1 .",
    "as wire 1 has a finite length @xmath8 a steady drag current @xmath9 is established .    within the fermi liquid approach",
    "we restrict ourselves to direct electron - electron collisions mediated by the coulomb interaction .",

    "the absolute values of the four quantities , namely , @xmath20 and @xmath21 should be within the stripes @xmath22 near the corresponding fermi levels .",

    ", we calculate the drag current by solving the boltzmann equation for wire 1 ( otherwise we should have solved a system of coupled equations for both wires ) .",

    "second , and perhaps the major difficulty , has been the difficulty in creating parallel , electrically isolated , quantum wires with a spatial separation large enough to completely suppress interwire , while small enough to give a drag voltage of a reasonable magnitude .",

    "the advantage of the planar geometry is that the interwire separation can be changed in - situ by changing the bias voltage of the central gate m. the disadvantage is that the narrow central gate creates a soft lateral potential barrier and to prevent tunneling between the wires the width of this barrier has to be of a sufficient magnitude , which sets a limit to the minimum interwire distance that can be used without electron tunneling interfering .",
    "samples with a vertical geometry have been widely used for studying coulomb drag between 2d electron layers [ 2 ] .",
    "the main advantage of the vertical geometry is that very small interwire separation ( the barrier width ) can be obtained without tunneling between wires . since the magnitude of the drag",
    "is expected to decrease exponentially with interwire separation , one can expect to observe enhanced drag with the vertical samples because of the smaller separation that can be achieved with such samples .",

    "the origin of the observed peaks in the drag voltage @xmath6 ( fig.6 ) can be understood when one considers eqs .",
    "( 16)-(21 ) of sec .",

    "both the increase and the narrowing of the first drag peak in a magnetic field of 0.86 tesla ( fig 6(b ) ) can be attributed to an increase of the density of states in1d the subbands due to the magnetic - field - induced enhancement of the electron effective mass .",
    "the reduction in the magnitude of the drag peak as we move away from the first peak toward higher values of v@xmath254 can be attributed to an increase in the effective interwire separation of the wires .",

    "an increase in v@xmath254 increases the width of the drive wire and hence @xmath259 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath7 for v@xmath278 occurs due to tunneling of a considerable fraction of the current from the drive wire to the drag one , reducing the measured @xmath7 .",
    "the experimental observed features of the drag effect discussed above , namely , the origin of the drag voltage peaks , the effect the magnetic field , and the interwire separation dependence , can all be understood in the framework of both the fl and the ll theory .",

    "the observed temperature dependence of @xmath7 , shown in fig.9 , is in sharp contrast with the linear temperature dependence predicted by the fl theory ( eq .",

    "this allows us to conclude that the pmd contribution , if present at all , is insignificant .",
    "it is quite obvious from the content of sec .",
    "iv that substantial experimental work remains to be done to gain a comprehensive understanding of the physics of coulomb drag between interacting 1d electron systems and to explore the conditions under which such systems behave as a fermi liquid or a luttinger liquid .",
    "since the measurement of the coulomb drag also provides a new experimental tool to probe the ll state that ca nt be done from the measurement of the conductance alone , extensive experimental work on the subject is needed to put the ll model of interacting 1d systems on a firm footing .",
    "though the theory of coulomb drag has considerably outstripped experimental work , many open questions need to be addressed in the theoretical area as well .    on the experimental side",
    ", work should be focused on measurements that can distinguish between a ll and a fl state and can provide information about the existence and the nature of the ll state .",
    "this is an extremely important area for condensed matter physics .",
    "the few papers published so far , claiming to have observed a luttinger liquid , have not been convincing . in this respect , it would be highly interesting to study the drag between spin polarized systems , since the ll theory predicts different exponents for spin polarized and unpolarized cases and manifestation of the spin effect should be quite different in the fermi liquid and the luttinger liquid state .",
    "another interesting experimental possibility is to study drag when the wire length @xmath8 falls below the thermal length @xmath284 to investigate if the drag resistance @xmath7 decays @xmath300 as predicted by ll liquid theory . when the number of electrons in the wires is very small ( sec .",
    "iv ) , one should expect relatively large fluctuations of the drag current or voltage , such as shot noise @xcite@xcite , and possible reversal of the sign of drag leading to negative drag @xcite .",
    "observation of this noise can also provide valuable information on correlated electron state .",
    "one could also envision a search for 1d spin coulomb drag @xcite . finally , it is also important to study acoustic phonon - mediated drag ( pmd ) @xcite @xcite since under certain conditions it can be comparable to and even larger than the coulomb drag . if such a pmd is present in the experimental measurements , one has to find ways to separate it from the coulomb drag .",
    "the theory of coulomb drag based on the ll model is far from mature and many open questions need to be addressed such as the effect of disorder , the influence of tunneling between the wires , etc .. alhough the power - law temperature dependence of the drag resistance is a signature of the luttinger liquid state , a careful analysis of various limiting cases based on the fermi liquid approach should be carried out to make sure that under no circumstances it can give a similar temperature dependence .",
    "it is equally important to investigate the physical situations and interactions ( within the wires and with the reservoirs ) that favor transition of the fermi liquid into the luttinger liquid and vice versa ."

    "<S> the presence of pronounced electronic correlations in a one - dimensional systems strongly enhances coulomb coupling and is expected to result in distinctive features in the coulomb drag between them that are absent in the drag between two - dimensional systems . in this article , we review recent fermi and luttinger liquid theories of coulomb drag between ballistic one - dimensional electron systems , alias quantum wires , in the absence of inter - wire tunneling , to focus on these features and give a brief summary of the experimental work reported so far on one - dimensional drag . both the fermi liquid ( fl ) and the luttinger liquid ( ll ) theory predict a maximum of the drag resistance @xmath0 when the one - dimensional subbands of the two quantum wires are aligned and the fermi wave vector @xmath1 is small , and also an exponential decay of @xmath0 with increasing inter - wire separation , both features confirmed by experimental observations . </S>",
