    "the complex behavior of mixtures of bosonic gases has been extensively investigated experimentally  in particular , in cold - atom systems  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",

    "we show that , independently whether the noncritical component is in the normal or superfluid phase , the critical behavior of the condensing species belongs to the 3d xy universality class characterized by the breaking of a global u(1 ) symmetry and by short - range effective interactions .",

    "since the normal - to - superfluid transition of a single species is related to the spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) symmetry of the condensing species , it seems natural that the critical behavior belongs to the standard 3d xy universality class  @xcite .",

    "this hypothesis is quite natural when the spectator species is in the normal phase , which is characterized by short - range correlations .",
    "however , if the second component is in the superfluid phase , in which long - range spin - wave ( goldstone ) modes develop , the asymptotic decoupling of the two species is no longer obvious .",
    "indeed , the goldstone modes may give rise to effective long - range interactions among the condensing particles .",
    "as a consequence , one might observe a different critical behavior ( we recall that the standard 3d xy universality is observed only if the interactions decay sufficiently fast with the distance ) , or xy behavior with peculiar slowly - decaying scaling corrections , as it occurs in the case of mixtures of identical bosonic gases  @xcite .    to investigate these issues , we perform quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations of the 2bh model in the hc limit for both species ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "our results provide a robust evidence that the critical behaviors belong to the 3d xy universality class along all continuous transition lines , including those where one species condenses in the superfluid background of the other one . in other words ,",
    "the local inter - species density - density interaction is an irrelevant rg perturbation at all bec transition lines .",
    "there is also no evidence of slowly - decaying scaling corrections .",
    "apparently , the leading scaling corrections are always controlled by the leading irrelevant rg operator which appears in the standard xy model or at the bec transition of a one - component bosonic gas .    as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ multi ] , these features change when we approach a mcp , where several transition lines meet . in that case the competition of the two condensing order parameters gives rise to more important effects .",
    "we consider the 2bh model ( [ sbh ] ) with @xmath98 in the hc limit @xmath99 , for cubic @xmath100 lattices with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "moreover , we determine the nature of the critical behavior at a few selected points , at which the spectator species is both in the normal and in the superfluid phase .    for this purpose",
    ", we focus on the finite - size scaling ( fss ) behavior of the helicity modulus , which generally provides the most precise numerical results to characterize the critical behavior .",

    "we do not report the corresponding results .",
    "we only mention that they substantially confirm the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the helicity modulus .",
    "the helicity modulus at the bec transition of the @xmath7-species is expected to behave as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the correlation - length exponent , and the linear scaling field @xmath111 is a linear combination of @xmath45 and of the model parameters , which vanishes at the critical point .",

    "the possible universality classes that describe the multicritical behaviors are associated with the stable fps of the rg flow .",
    "they can be determined by studying the rg trajectories in the critical theory , starting from the unstable gaussian fp in the quartic - parameter space . for this purpose",
    ", we consider the so - called @xmath223 scheme without @xmath222 expansion @xcite .",
    "we start from the five - loop @xmath340 @xmath221 functions , resum them using the pad - borel technique , and solve the flow equations .",
    "we find two stable fps , that also belong to the @xmath1 theory ( [ phi4s ] ) , which has an additional @xmath2 symmetry related to the exchange of the two order parameters .",
    "this more symmetric model has already been discussed in the context of the critical behavior of a mixture of two identical gases @xcite .",
    "if the system has a tetracritical continuous transition , see fig .",
    "[ mcpd ] , the critical behavior is controlled by a decoupled fp .",
    "each component shows an xy critical behavior",
    " correspondingly , the rg dimensions of the two relevant operators are @xmath341 but with very slowly - decaying scaling corrections ( they decay as @xmath342 , where @xmath184 is the correlation length ) due to inter - species coupling . if , instead , the system undergoes a bicritical continuous transition , the critical behavior is associated with a different asymmetric fp , with @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",
    "recent experiments on atomic gas mixtures  @xcite , either using two different atomic species or the same atomic species in two different states , have already obtained several interesting results on the properties of the low - temperature condensed phase and on the interplay of the different condensates .",
    "they have also demonstrated the possibility of a robust control of the model parameters , which may allow the observation of the different phases , such as those found in the present study , and the determination of the nature of the critical and multicritical behaviors .",
    "our results should provide a complete characterization of the possible bec patterns and of the critical behaviors that these systems may develop along their transition lines .",
    "most cold - atom experiments have been performed in inhomogeneous conditions , due to the presence of space - dependent trapping forces , which effectively confine the atomic gas within a limited space region  @xcite . the trapping potential is effectively coupled to the particle density , which may be taken into account by adding a further hamiltonian term to the 2bh hamiltonian ( [ sbh ] ) , i.e. , @xmath345 where @xmath65 is the space - dependent potential associated with the external force .",
    "the inhomogeneity arising from the trapping potential introduces an additional length scale @xmath346 into the problem , which drastically changes the general features of the behavior at the phase transitions .",
    "experimental data for inhomogeneous trapped cold - atom systems are usually analyzed using the local - density approximation , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "however , this approach fails to describe the emergence of large - scale correlations  @xcite .",
    "this problem may be overcome experimentally by using ( almost ) flat traps , giving rise to a finite space region where the system is effectively homogenous  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , one may infer the critical behavior by studying the scaling behavior with respect to the trap size @xmath346 , which is expected to be universal and controlled by the critical exponents of the universality class of the corresponding homogenous system , in the large trap - size limit  @xcite .",
