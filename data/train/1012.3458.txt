    "many experiments are currently searching for dark matter ( dm ) in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , by looking for rare scattering events off nuclei in the detectors , and many others are planned for the next decade @xcite .",
    "this direct dm detection strategy has brought over the last year several interesting observations and upper limits .",
    "the results of the dama / libra @xcite and , more recently , the cogent @xcite collaborations have been tentatively interpreted as due to dm particles .",
    "it appears however that these results can not be fully reconciled with other experimental findings , in particular with the null searches from xenon100 @xcite or cdms @xcite , and are also in tension with zeplin - iii @xcite . in this context",
    ", the next generation of low - background , underground detectors is eagerly awaited and will hopefully confirm or rule out a dm interpretation .",
    "if convincing evidence is obtained for dm particles with direct detection experiments , the obvious next step will be to attempt a reconstruction of the physical parameters of the dm particle , namely its mass and scattering cross - section ( see e.g.  refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "this is a non - trivial task , hindered by the different uncertainties associated with the computation of wimp - induced recoil spectra . in particular , galactic model uncertainties ",
    "i.e.  uncertainties pertaining to the density and velocity distribution of wimps in our neighbourhood  play a crucial role . in attempting reconstruction , the simplest assumption to make",
    "is a fixed local dm density @xmath2 and a `` standard halo model '' , i.e.  an isotropic isothermal sphere density profile and a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of velocities with a given galactic escape velocity @xmath3 and one - dimensional dispersion @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the most probable velocity and @xmath6 the local circular velocity , see below ) .",
    "however , the galactic model parameters are only estimated to varying degrees of accuracy , so that the true local population of dm likely deviates from the highly idealised standard halo model .",
    "several attempts have been made to improve on the standard approach @xcite . in the case of a detected signal at one experiment ,",
    "recent analyses have studied how complementary detectors can extract dark matter properties , independent of our knowledge of the galactic model  @xcite .",
    "certain properties of dark matter may also be extracted under assumptions about the nature of the nuclear recoil events  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , eventual multiple signals at different targets have been shown to be useful in constraining both dark matter and astrophysical properties @xcite and in extracting spin - dependent and spin - independent couplings @xcite . here ,",
    "using a bayesian approach , we study how uncertainties on galactic model parameters affect the determination of the dm mass @xmath7 and spin - independent wimp - proton scattering cross - section @xmath8 .",
    "in particular we focus on realistic experimental capabilities for the future generation of ton - scale detectors  to be reached within the next 10 years  with noble liquids ( argon , xenon ) and cryogenic ( germanium ) technologies .",
    "the main focus of this paper is the complementarity between different detection targets .",
    "it is well - known ( see e.g.  @xcite ) that different targets are sensitive to different directions in the @xmath9 plane , which is very useful to achieve improved reconstruction capabilities  or more stringent bounds in the case of null results .",
    "this problem has often been addressed without taking proper account of galactic model uncertainties .",
    "using xenon ( xe ) , argon ( ar ) and germanium ( ge ) as case - studies , we ascertain to what extent unknowns in galactic model parameters limit target complementarity . a thorough understanding of complementarity will be crucial in the near future since it provides us with a sound handle to compare experiments and , if needed , decide upon the best target to bet on future detectors .",
    "our results also have important consequences for the combination of collider observables and direct detection results ( for a recent work see @xcite ) .",
    "besides degrading the extraction of physical properties like @xmath7 and @xmath8 , uncertainties in the galactic model will challenge our ability to distinguish between different particle physics frameworks in case of a positive signal .",
    "other relevant unknowns are hadronic uncertainties , related essentially to the content of nucleons @xcite . here",
    ", we undertake a model - independent approach without specifying an underlying wimp theory and using @xmath7 and @xmath8 as our phenomenological parameters  for this reason we shall not address hadronic uncertainties ( hidden in @xmath8 ) .",
    "a comprehensive work complementary to ours and done in the supersymmetric framework has been presented recently @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give some basic formulae for wimp - nucleus recoil rates in direct detection experiments . in section [ exp ]",
    "the upcoming experimental capabilities are detailed , while section [ statsection ] describes our bayesian approach .",
    "we outline the relevant galactic model uncertainties and our modelling of the velocity distribution function in section [ astrounc ] and present our results in section [ results ] before concluding in section [ secconc ] .",
    "several thorough reviews on direct dark matter searches exist in the literature @xcite . in this section , we simply recall the relevant formulae , emphasizing the impact of target properties and unknown quantities .",
    "the elastic recoil spectrum produced by wimps of mass @xmath7 and local density @xmath10 on target nuclei @xmath11 of mass @xmath12 is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wimp velocity in the detector rest frame , @xmath15 is the earth velocity in the galactic rest frame , @xmath16 is the wimp velocity distribution in the galactic rest frame and @xmath17 is the wimp - nucleus cross - section .",
    "the integral is performed over @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the minimum wimp velocity that produces a nuclear recoil of energy @xmath20 .",
    ".   simply states that the recoil rate is the flux of wimps @xmath21 , averaged over the velocity distribution @xmath16 , times the probability of interaction with one target nucleus @xmath17 .",
    "anticipating the scale of future detectors , we will think of measuring @xmath22 in units of counts / ton / yr / kev . for",
    "non - relativistic ( elastic ) collisions  as appropriate for halo wimps , presenting @xmath23  the kinematics fixes the recoil energy @xmath24 and the minimum velocity @xmath25 in which @xmath26 is the scattering angle in the centre of mass and @xmath27 is the wimp - nucleus reduced mass .    in principle , all wimp - nucleus couplings enter in the cross - section @xmath17 .",
    "however , we shall focus solely on spin - independent ( si ) scalar interactions so that @xmath28 where @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] is the wimp - nucleus spin - independent cross - section at zero momentum transfer and @xmath30 is the so - called form factor that accounts for the exchange of momentum . assuming that the wimp couplings to protons and neutrons are similar , @xmath31 , and defining @xmath32 ( @xmath33 being the wimp - proton reduced mass )",
    ", one gets @xmath34 for the form factor , we use the parameterisation in @xcite appropriate for spin - independent couplings , namely @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 fm , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 fm .    as noticed above , in eq .",
    "@xmath15 is the earth velocity with respect to the galactic rest frame and amounts to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 km / s is the local circular velocity , @xmath43 km / s is the peculiar velocity of the sun ( with respect to @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 km / s is the earth velocity with respect to the sun ( i.e.  the earth orbit ) . here , we are not interested in the annual modulation signal nor directional signatures but rather in the average recoil rate  therefore we shall neglect @xmath46 and @xmath47 and take @xmath48 .    under these assumptions ,",
    "eq .   may be recast in a very convenient way : @xmath49 where we have used eq .",
    ", defined @xmath50 and made explicit the dependence of @xmath51 on the velocity distribution parameters @xmath5 and @xmath3 . below",
    "we discuss in more detail the connection between the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the distribution of dm is encoded in the factor @xmath51 ( and @xmath10 ) , whereas the detector - related quantities appear in @xmath52 ( and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the apparent degeneracy along the direction @xmath53 may be broken by using different recoil energies and/or different targets since @xmath51 is sensitive to a non - trivial combination of @xmath7 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "nevertheless , for very massive wimps @xmath56 , the minimum velocity becomes independent of @xmath7 , @xmath57 , and the degeneracy @xmath58 can not be broken .",
    "depending on the target being used , this usually happens for wimp masses above a few hundred gev .",
    "ultimately , the observable we will be interested in is the number of recoil events in a given energy bin @xmath59 : @xmath60 @xmath61 being the effective exposure ( usually expressed in ton@xmath62yr ) and @xmath63 the recoil rate smeared according to the energy resolution of the detector @xmath64 , @xmath65    three fiducial wimp models will be used to assess the capabilities of future direct detection experiments : @xmath6625 , 50 and 250 gev , all with @xmath67 pb . these models are representative of well - motivated candidates such as neutralinos in supersymmetric theories @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the uncertainties used thus far and outlined in section [ astrounc ] are a reasonable representation of the current knowledge . for illustration",
    "it is also interesting to consider the effect of tighter constraints on galactic model parameters in the reconstruction of wimp properties .",
    "we start by computing the correlation coefficient between the parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath68 ) when they are constrained by the combined data set xe+ge+ar  see table [ tabcorr ] .",
    "clearly , for all benchmark models , @xmath8 and @xmath10 as well as @xmath7 and @xmath5 are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath10 is obvious since @xmath69 . as for the degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath5 , it is easy to verify that , for @xmath70 ,",
    "@xmath51 defined in eq",
    ".   goes approximately as @xmath71 and thus @xmath72 .",
    "table [ tabcorr ] also shows a small ( anti-)correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath5 ; all other correlations are negligible",
    ". therefore , @xmath10 and @xmath5 are the dominant sources of uncertainty and their more accurate determination will lead to a significant improvement on the reconstruction of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "to illustrate this point we follow @xcite and apply a 7% ( 4.2% ) uncertainty on @xmath10 ( @xmath5 ) , while maintaining the same central values as before , thus reducing the realistic error bars used above by a factor @xmath73 for both parameters .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figredastro ] where we consider the combination xe+ge+ar .",
    "a future more constrained astrophysical setup may indeed lead to a better reconstruction of the wimp mass and scattering cross - section .     and @xmath5 .",
    "the red surfaces refer to the scan using the fiducial astrophysical setup ; the yellow surfaces ( and dotted lines ) indicate the effect of marginalising over the uncertainties in table [ tabpars ] ; the blue surfaces ( and solid lines ) correspond to the reduced uncertainties @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77.,width=336,height=287 ]         to this point we have studied the impact of galactic model uncertainties on the extraction of dm properties from direct detection data .",
    "however , once a positive signal is well - established , it may be used to determine some of the galactic parameters directly from direct detection data ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , without relying on external priors .",
    "this would amount to achieving a self - calibration of the astrophysical uncertainties affecting direct detection rates . in order to explore such possibility",
    "we re - ran our analysis but dropping the gaussian priors on @xmath10 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 described in section [ astrounc ] .",
    "instead , we used uniform , non - informative priors on @xmath10 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath68 in the ranges indicated in the middle column of table [ tabpars ] .",
    "we focus on the 50 gev benchmark and use the data sets xe , xe+ge and xe+ge+ar . with this large freedom on the astrophysical side ,",
    "it turns out that direct detection data alone leave @xmath10 , @xmath3 and @xmath68 unconstrained within their ranges while @xmath8 is pinpointed within approximately one order of magnitude . only the dm mass @xmath7 and the circular velocity @xmath5",
    "can be constrained by direct detection , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figflatastro ] .",
    "this figure stresses two interesting results .",
    "first , if @xmath78 gev ( and @xmath67 pb ) , the next generation of experiments will be able to determine the wimp mass within a few tens of gev ( percent 1@xmath79 accuracy of 11.8% ) even with very loose assumptions on the local dm distribution .",
    "second , the right frame in fig .",
    "[ figflatastro ] shows that the combination of xe , ge and ar targets is very powerful in constraining @xmath5 on its own without external priors . in particular",
    ", the data set xe+ge+ar ( solid blue line ) is sufficient to infer at 1@xmath79 @xmath80 km / s ( compared to the top - hat prior in the range 80@xmath81380 km / s ) .",
    "this represents already a smaller uncertainty than the present - day constraint that we have taken , @xmath82 km / s  in case of a positive signal , a combination of direct detection experiments will probe in an effective way the local circular velocity . repeating the same exercise for the 25 gev benchmark",
    "we find good mass reconstruction but a weaker constraint : @xmath83 km / s .",
    "again , we stress that the quoted @xmath5 uncertainties in this paragraph do not take into account possible systematic deviations from the parameterisation in eq . .",
    "we have discussed the reconstruction of the key phenomenological parameters of wimps , namely mass and scattering cross - section off nuclei , in case of positive detection with one or more direct dm experiments planned for the next decade .",
    "we have in particular studied the complementarity of ton scale experiments with xe , ar and ge targets , adopting experimental configurations that may realistically become available over this time scale .    to quantify the degree of complementarity of different targets we have introduced a figure of merit measuring the inverse of the area enclosed by the 95% marginalised contours in the plane @xmath84 .",
    "there is a high degree of complementarity of different targets : for our benchmark with @xmath85 gev and our fiducial set of galactic model parameters , the relative error on the reconstructed mass goes from 8.1% for an analysis based on a xenon experiment only , to 5.2% for a combined analysis with germanium , to 4.5% adding also argon . allowing the parameters to vary within the observational uncertainties significantly degrades the reconstruction of the mass , increasing the relative error by up to a factor of @xmath864 for xenon and germanium , especially due to the uncertainty on @xmath10 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , we found that combining data from ar , ge and xe should allow to reconstruct a 50 gev wimp mass to 11.8% accuracy even under weaker astrophysical constraints than currently available .",
    "although the mass reconstruction accuracy may appear modest , any improvement of this reconstruction is important , in particular in view of the possible measurement of the same quantity at the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "the existence of a particle with a mass compatible , within the respective uncertainties , with that deduced from direct detection experiments would provide a convincing proof that the particles produced in accelerators are stable over cosmological time scales .",
    "although this is not sufficient to claim discovery of dm @xcite , it would certainly be reassuring .    despite the strong dependence of direct detection experiments on the galactic model",
    "degrades the reconstruction of dm properties , it does open up the possibility to potentially constrain the local distribution of dm , in case of detection with multiple targets .",
    "for example in the case of a low mass 50 gev wimp , we have shown that the local circular velocity can be determined from direct detection data alone more accurately than it is presently measured using the local distribution of stars and gas clouds .",
    "additionally , directly detecting dm provides the most realistic way of measuring the local dm velocity distribution .",
    "this will in principle provide invaluable information on the structure and formation of the milky way halo .",
