    "one of the constraints that lead to the nielsen - ninomiya @xcite no - go theorem , is the chiral invariance of the dirac action @xmath2 for massless fermions on the lattice . under certain conditions @xcite , the spectrum of fermions @xmath3 would suffer from doubling , and",
    "the axial anomaly would cancel .",
    "this has been , from the onset , a recurrent problem of lattice qcd @xcite . in order to recover the axial anomaly , at least at the pertubative level , ginsparg and wilson @xcite derived a relation , the ginsparg - wilson relation ( gwr ) which explicitly breaks the standard chiral symmetry , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a matrix proportional to the lattice spacing @xmath6 ( in most of this",
    "talk we will consider the case where @xmath5 is a simple number ) .",
    "recently lsher @xcite proved that chiral invariance of an action @xmath2 which complies with the gwr can be recovered in an extended form , @xmath7 thus a conjecture appeared in the literature suggesting that it may be possible to overcome the nielsen - ninomiya no - go theorem on the lattice and to fully simulate , without doubling , the chiral symmetry of qcd ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this includes pcac @xcite and the axial anomaly @xcite .",

    "for instance the fixed point topological density @xcite coincides , on all gauge configurations , with the density ( [ gwr density ] ) defined with the fixed point dirac operator .",
    "the recent overlap gwr solution of neuberger @xcite also solves the gwr and complies with the index theorem .",
    "the neuberger solution was checked in dimension @xmath0 for smooth gauge configurations @xcite , and in dimension @xmath13 in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "thus the gwr , together with these recent results , essentially solve the problem of the topological index theorem on the lattice .",

    "this suggests that different gwr dirac operators and topological densities produce different indexes when we depart from the continuum limit , to a finite lattice with finite charge density . in this",
    "talk we address the _ extremum _ problem of finding the lattice dirac operator which provides the best index ( [ index ] ) . because this is a difficult problem , we specialize in lattice actions which are constructed with the wilson action @xcite . in order to compare the index of different dirac operators , we first choose a single topological charge density .",
    "although this is an arbitrary definition , let us choose the simplest near neighbor lattice topological charge density which discretizes the continuum density @xmath14 and which sums to an integer total topological charge .",
    "then we search for the gwr dirac operator which index ( [ index ] ) is closer to this simplest topological charge .",

    "only local actions are universal .",
    "moreover it has been conjectured @xcite that local gwr solutions have better topological properties than non - local ones . only topological configurations which are larger than the range of the couplings in @xmath2 would produce a number of zero modes @xmath15 different from @xmath16 in agreement with eq .",

    "this continues reference @xcite .",
    "the wilson action @xmath81 is the simplest and most used lattice action , see section [ sec - wilson ] .",
    "our framework is the massless wilson action with parameters @xmath82 , see eqs ( [ wilsoneg ] ) , in a simple 2-dimensional u(1 ) gauge theory which is a discrete version of the schwinger model , see section [ sec - topology ] . in the continuum",
    "the wilson action @xcite exactly complies with the index theorem ( [ index ] ) , but for finite lattices it does not .",
    "our aim in this section is to extrapolate the topological charge from the continuum to the lattices of different size @xmath52 , and to study how the wilson action deviates from the index theorem .",
    "we encounter the problem that the topological charge and the topological density on the lattice are not uniquely defined .",
    "this problem is not present in the continuum , where the topological density and its derivatives are well defined .",
    "this implies that a lattice action close to the continuum limit is only allowed to have a topological charge density both small and nearly constant .",
    "however we are interested , both physically and mathematically , in extrapolating the index theorem to the case of finite lattices , with finite topological charge .",
    "and then we want to investigate how far the topological density can be increased without spoiling the index theorem .",
    "to remain as close as possible to the continuum definitions , we momentarily specialize to very smooth gauge configurations .",
    "in particular we study the wilson action in configurations with constant plaquette density , see section [ sec - topology ] , which is equivalent to a constant topological charge density .",
    "first we study some general properties of the wilson action . because it is @xmath17 hermitean , the spectrum of its eigenvalues , here denoted @xmath20 ,",
    "is symmetric with respect to the real axis of the argand plot , see section [ sec - properties ] .",
    "moreover in @xmath0 it turns out that in the case of even lattices , the spectrum of @xmath83 in the argand plot is also symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis .",
    "the transformation @xmath84 leaves the spectrum invariant ( see for instance figs . [ eigenwil1],[eigenwil2],[eigenwil3 ] ) .",
    "so we will use even @xmath52 lattices with @xmath85 from now on , for simplicity .",
    "we also remark that @xmath86 real@xmath87 for any non vanishing gauge configuration , thus @xmath81 is invertible ( except in the free quark case ) . in what concerns @xmath88 we observe that its eigenvalues are exactly symmetric with respect to the origin .",
    "this implies for instance that the traces tr@xmath89 $ ] and tr@xmath90 $ ] both vanish for any finite @xmath91 .",
    "this is not the case of the trace tr@xmath92/{\\cal z}$ ] which is non vanishing and has been proposed as a topological index @xcite , where @xmath93 is a constant normalizing factor .",
    "however we will not further study this proposed topological charge because it clearly is neither local nor integer .",
    "we now study quantitatively the real eigenvalues and the topological properties of the wilson action @xmath81 .",
    "we are interested in eigenvalues @xmath94 with chirality @xmath95 , see section [ sec - properties ] .",
    "the non vanishing chirality implies that the relevant eigenvalues are the real eigenvalues .",
    "the @xmath74 term was introduced in the free action by wilson to separate the four roots of the @xmath65 , see section [ sec - wilson ] . in the free limit",
    "this results in four real eigenvalues : one root at @xmath96 , two degenerate eigenvalues equal to @xmath97 and one eigenvalue equal to @xmath98 . here",
    "we find that quite a similar separation exists in the quadruplets of real eigenvalues that occur in gauge configurations with a finite topological charge ( see figs .",
    "[ eigenwil1],[eigenwil2],[eigenwil3 ] ) .",
    "moreover the chirality of these real eigenvalues approximately agree with the index theorem .",

    "+ - the real eigenvalues and the corresponding chiralities are close to integers .",
    "the difference is proportional to a small number , @xmath106 .",

    "+ - when @xmath108 approaches the maximum value of the order of @xmath110 , these 3 sets of eigenvalues spread out to 3 finite intervals , and eventually they overlap .",

    "+ - in the continuum limit of @xmath112 , and for very smooth topological objects , all the different @xmath113 .",
    "so we find that in this limit of large n , and from the view point of zero modes , the index theorem is verified , @xmath114 this result agrees with the proofs of fujikawa @xcite and adams @xcite .",
    "if we now leave the case of constant topological density , it occurs that @xmath115 ( we mean that the absolute value of the topological density @xmath105 is smaller than 0.22 in any plaquette of the lattice ) is a sufficient condition to enforce that @xmath103 .",
    "we verified this crucial result with a large number of randomly generated gauge configurations , for all possible @xmath51 .",
    "all the remaining properties , that we just detailed , of the eigenvalues of the wilson action are also maintained when @xmath116 .",
    "this suggests that it is possible to extrapolate the continuum limit to a significant and finite subinterval of the range @xmath117 .    to illustrate how the complex eigenvalues transform in real ones ,",
    "we arbitrarily interpolate between different constant charge densities with a continuous variation of the topological parameter @xmath55 ( see section [ sec - topology ] ) .",
    "it turns out that for some particular values of @xmath55 , which produce a large @xmath104 at the point @xmath118 , two opposite pairs of complex eigenvalues ( with @xmath96 chirality ) quite suddenly transform into two opposite pairs of real eigenvalues , and then these real eigenvalues continuously increase their chirality @xmath119 .",

    "our criterion complies with the chiu and zenkin criterion @xcite which states that the correct gwr solutions must have at least one eigenvalue at @xmath35 .",
    "however we observe that it is possible to find a non - local action with eigenvalues at @xmath35 , which does not have zero modes outside the free limit .",
    "therefore , unlike the locality condition , the chiu - zenkin criterion is not a sufficient condition to force an action to comply with the index theorem , although it certainly constitutes a necessary condition .",
    "our criterion can be applied to the neuberger gwr solution defined with @xmath169 . with the @xmath20 substitution",
    "we find that @xmath170 .",
    "this complies with our criterion when @xmath171 , and it is quite evident that this is the simplest action which complies with it .",
    "the criterion shows that the neuberger overlap action is the simplest gwr solution constructed with the wilson action that maximally complies with the index theorem .    moreover , in the schwinger model and using the dimensionless units of @xmath82 , we find that @xmath172 .",
    "this determines @xmath171 with a value which is not very far from the @xmath173 that provides the highest locality in the free limit .",
    "this choice of @xmath174 increases the precision of the observation of chandrasekharan @xcite , stating that the neuberger action only complies with the index theorem if @xmath175 , ( @xmath175 can also be derived from the root and pole structure of the free neuberger action ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath174 completely fixes the gwr parameter @xmath5 because the free continuum limit of the lattice implies that @xmath176 .",
    "so the best choice seems to be @xmath177 .",
    "finally we outline possible continuations of this study .",
    "we are researching the analytical extension of the proof of our criterion to finite topological densities @xmath178 .",
    "the repetition of the present study in four dimensions would also be physically relevant .",
    "i acknowledge misha polikarpov for explaining computing techniques and topology on the lattice .",
    "i am also grateful to herbert neuberger for explaining the locality conjecture and for pointing to a numerical error .",
    "i thank dimitri diakonov , isabel salavessa and emilio ribeiro for discussions on the topological index .",
