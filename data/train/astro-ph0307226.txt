    "determining which stars give rise to supernovae ( sne ) is at the heart of sn research .",
    "the main obstacle is that a sn leaves few traces of the progenitor star . only a small handful of historical sne ( sn 1961v [ zwicky 1964 , 1965 ] , sn 1978k [ ryder et al .  1993 ] , sn 1987a [ e.g. , gilmozzi et al .",

    "additionally , it should be noted that these five sne were all at least somewhat unusual .",
    "van dyk , li , & filippenko ( 2003a ) recently attempted the direct identification of the progenitors of 16 relatively normal type ii and type ib / c sne , using archival images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) .",
    "they may have identified the progenitors of the type ii sne 1999br and 1999ev , the type ib sne 2001b and 2001is , and the type ic sn 1999bu .",
    "subsequent follow - up to the tentative identification of the progenitor of the type ii sn 2001du , using an _ hst _ image of the sn itself , resulted in an upper limit to the progenitor s mass ( van dyk , li , & filippenko 2003b ; see also smartt et al .",

    "we attempt to identify the progenitor of a recent and relatively nearby type ii - plateau ( ii - p ) event .",
    "sn 2003gd was visually discovered by evans ( 2003 ) on june 12.82 ut at about 13.2 mag , and about 20  east and 150  south of the nucleus of messier 74 ( m74 ; ngc 628 ) .",
    "mcnaught ( 2003a ) confirmed the discovery on ccd images and measured an accurate optical position for the sn of @xmath7(j2000 ) = @xmath8 , @xmath9(j2000 ) = @xmath10 ( mcnaught 2003b ) .",
    "garnavich & bass ( 2003a ) obtained near - infrared ( 0.852.4 @xmath11 m ) spectra of sn 2003gd on june 13.46 ut ; the strong , broad paschen - line emission in the @xmath12-band order of the spectrum led them to classify the sn as type ii .",
    "this classification has since been confirmed by kotak , meikle , & smartt ( 2003 ) and by phillips ( 2003 ) , both groups suggesting that the sn was discovered at an age of @xmath1312 months . from ground - based images , garnavich & bass ( 2003b ) place a limit on the progenitor star brightness of @xmath14 mag at four months before discovery .",
    "m74 was also the host to the peculiar type ic sn 2002ap ( e.g. , mazzali et al .",
    "2002 ; leonard et al . 2002c ; foley et al .",
    "both sharina , karachentsev , & tikhonov ( 1996 ) and sohn & davidge ( 1996 ) measured a distance to m74 , based on photometry of the brightest stars in the galaxy .",
    "their consistent results indicate a true ( extinction - corrected ) distance modulus @xmath15 mag , corresponding to a distance of about 7.2 mpc . lacking any additional distance information",
    ", we assume this distance throughout this paper .",
    "pre - sn archival _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 images containing the sn site were obtained by program go-9676 , using several different pointings , on 2002 august 25 and 28 ut in the bands f606w and f300w , for total exposure times of 3100 s and 3000 s , respectively .",
    "a summary of the available _ hst _ data is given in table 1 .",
    "recent multi - band images of sn 2002ap were obtained by go-9114 in 2003 january using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , but , unfortunately for us , these were made with the high - resolution camera ( hrc ) .",
    "the hrc s field - of - view is too small , and the displacement of sn 2002ap from sn 2003gd is too large , for these images to be useful in detecting the progenitor .",
    "( furthermore , at the time of this writing , these images were still proprietary . )",
    "it is absolutely essential to locate the sn site in the _ hst _ images with high astrometric precision . from a @xmath16-band image obtained with the las campanas observatory 1.0-m telescope and kindly provided by m.  hamuy ,",
    "we have measured a precise position for the sn of @xmath7(j2000.0 ) = @xmath17 , @xmath9(j2000.0 ) = @xmath18 , with a total uncertainty of @xmath19 , using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) as the astrometric reference .",
    "note the excellent agreement with the position measured by ncnaught ( 2003b ) ; we adopt the average of these two measurements for the sn position , i.e. , @xmath7(j2000.0 ) = @xmath20 , @xmath9(j2000.0 ) = @xmath21 .",
    "position data for the sn are summarized in table 2 .    applying the astrometric method described by van dyk et al .",
    "( 2003a ) to a _ wmosaic _ of the _ hst _ f606w coadded image pair , u8ixcy02 m and u8ixcy03 m , utilizing a deep @xmath16-band image of m74 obtained at the palomar 1.5-m telescope ( see foley et al .",
    "2003 ) and again adopting 2mass as a reference , we are able to isolate the position of the sn on the mosaic to @xmath22 .",
    "this uncertainty is the sn absolute position uncertainty ( @xmath19 ) , the uncertainty in the astrometric grid applied to the palomar image ( @xmath23 ) , and the uncertainty in the grid further applied to the _ hst _ mosaic ( @xmath23 ) , as well as the relative difference between the absolute position measurements ( @xmath24 ) and the relative accuracy of the 2mass astrometry ( @xmath25 ) , all added in quadrature .",
    "the sn site is located on the wf2 chip , and the position uncertainty , at @xmath24 pixel@xmath26 for the wf chips , therefore corresponds to @xmath276 wf pixels .",
    "since the various pointings are difficult to properly align , both within and between the two bands , we elected to apply the photometry routine hstphot ( dolphin 2000a , 2000b ) to the images in each band in separate units , and to subsequently combine the results .",
    "( in fact , we were unable to derive the necessary offsets between the two f300w exposures u8ixca04 m and u8ixca05 m , and the third , u8ixca03 m , as a result of the low signal - to - noise ratio in all of these images . )",
    "hstphot automatically accounts for wfpc2 point - spread function ( psf ) variations and charge - transfer effects across the chips , zeropoints , aperture corrections , etc . in this case",
    "the hstphot output was in the flight magnitude system . in figure 1",
    "we show the sn environment in the f606w band .",
    "two sources , a and b , are detected by hstphot very near or within the error circle",
    ".    table 3 lists the photometry in the f606w band for stars a and b. the f606w magnitudes are the uncertainty - weighted average of the photometry performed on the u8ixcy01 m + u8ixcy02 m + u8ixcy03 m image trio and on the u8ixca01 m + u8ixca02 m image pair .",
    "unfortunately , the f300w exposures were not sensitive enough , since stars a and b were not detected in the f300w images , to @xmath28 mag ( 3@xmath29 ) .",
    "two other stars are seen in figure 1 about @xmath30 to the northeast of the error circle edge ; the easternmost one has @xmath31 mag , and the westernmost one has @xmath32 mag ( it appears to be somewhat blended ) .",
    "another two stars are seen near star a , one @xmath33 due east , and one @xmath34 due south ; the eastern one has @xmath35 mag , and the southern one has @xmath36 mag .",
    "several fainter sources are also seen within the error circle in figure 1 , but they are undetected by hstphot .",
    "we can attempt to estimate the masses of stars a and b and therefore comment on the plausibility of each as the likely sn progenitor . for this",
    "we need an estimate for the stars color , as well as the reddening toward the sn , and the metallicity of the sn environment . from the f300w images , limits on the color @xmath37",
    "are @xmath38 mag for star a and @xmath39 for star b. using the transformations from flight system to johnson - cousins magnitudes via synphot , applied to the bruzual spectral synthetic atlas ( see van dyk , filippenko , & li 2002 ) , this translates to @xmath40 mag for star a. the flight system color for star b is too blue to realistically transform to a standard color , but it is likely @xmath41 mag .",
    "additional color information for both progenitor candidates can be obtained from a high - quality @xmath4-band image ( seeing @xmath42 ) obtained with the 2.6-m nordic optical telescope ( not ; see larsen & richtler 1999 ) , archived and made available online by ned .",
    "figure 2 shows the sn environment , which is approximately the same field shown in figure 1 . matching the @xmath4-band and f606w images was not trivial , even after geometrically transforming one image relative to the other , due to the differences in pixel scale and resolution .",
    "however , two faint objects are seen in figure 2 very near the positions of both stars a and b ( the identification of the counterpart to star b on the @xmath4-band image is less certain than that for star a ) .",
    "assuming these are the @xmath4-band counterparts to stars a and b , this implies that these two stars are red . using psf - fitting photometry in daophot / allstar ( stetson 1987 , 1992 ) within iraf and , calibrating this image using the comparison stars in foley et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we find the @xmath4-band magnitudes for the two stars listed in table 3 . applying the transformations derived from synphot we convert @xmath43 for both stars to @xmath44 , and @xmath45 to @xmath16 ( for such red stars ,",
    "@xmath16 is @xmath46 mag fainter than @xmath45 ) ; these values , and their estimated uncertainties , are also listed in table 3 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath47 images of sn 2003gd on a number of epochs with the katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ; see li et al .",
    "2000 ; filippenko et al .",
    "again , we have calibrated these images using the comparison stars for sn 2002ap in foley et al .",
    "the sn photometry is listed in table 4 .",
    "the sn was already quite red at the time of discovery .",
    "unfortunately , the sn color is subject to a degeneracy between the sn age and the reddening .",
    "we can try to break this degeneracy through a comparison with the very well - studied type ii - p sn 1999em in ngc 1637 ( hamuy et al .",
    "2001 ; see also leonard et al .",
    "2002a and elmhamdi et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in figure 3",
    "we show the @xmath47 light curves of sn 2003gd and for comparison the light curves of sn 1999em , adjusted to the true distance modulus of m74 .",
    "no reddening correction is made to the light curve of sn 1999em to match that of sn 2003gd .",
    "( however , we have adjusted the light curves of both sne in time to find the best match . ) similarly , in figure 4 we show the color evolution of sn 2003gd , and for comparison , that of sn 1999em , with both sne corrected for reddening [ @xmath48 mag for sn 1999em , leonard et al .",
    "2002c ; @xmath2 mag for sn 2003gd , see below ] .",
    "both figures imply rather convincingly that sn 2003gd is also a sn ii - p and that it was quite old at the time of discovery ( near the end of the plateau phase of the light curves ) .",
    "similar to sn 1999em , sn 2003gd suffers relatively low reddening , which is also supported by the lack of interstellar na i d absorption , as well as low continuum polarization seen in spectra of sn 2003gd we have obtained at the lick 3-m and keck 10-m telescopes . although the photometry for the two sne ii - p agrees quite well during the plateau phase , it is most striking how much fainter sn 2003gd is relative to sn 1999em in the late - time nebular phase .",
    "the faint nebular - phase tail and large post - plateau drop may be suggestive of low ejected @xmath49ni mass , similar to the subluminous sne ii - p sn 1997d and 1999br ( benetti et al .",
    "2001 ; zampieri et al .",
    "a more detailed study of sn 2003gd is clearly warranted .    from the plateau we estimate an age for sn 2003gd of @xmath50 d on june 17 ut , placing the date of explosion at about march 17 ut , consistent with the range of explosion dates between february and april suggested by garnavich & bass ( 2003b ) . additionally , we estimate the total reddening to sn 2003gd as @xmath51 mag [ the galactic reddening toward m74 is itself quite low , @xmath52 mag ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ; and ned ] .    in figure 5 we show the absolute @xmath16 magnitude and @xmath53 color limits from the _ hst _ photometry for the two progenitor candidates , corrected for reddening to the sn , assuming the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) reddening law , and adjusted for the true m74 distance modulus .",
    "sn 2003gd occurred about 161  southeast of the m74 nucleus , or at @xmath54 . at this nuclear distance , van zee et al .",
    "( 1998 ) represent the relative oxygen abundance as log(o / h ) + 12 @xmath1 9 dex .",
    "the metallicity in the sn 2003gd environment , then , is possibly @xmath131.5 times greater than solar ( where the solar o / h abundance is 8.8 dex ; grevesse & sauval 1998 ) . in figure 5",
    "we therefore show for comparison the model stellar evolutionary tracks for a range of masses from lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) , assuming enhanced mass loss for the most massive stars and a metallicity @xmath55 for the sn environment .    from the positions of stars",
    "a and b in figure 5 , we can not rule out that the sn progenitor was a blue star",
    ". however , except for the most massive stars , which may evolve back to the blue toward the end of their lives ( such as seen for the 40 @xmath6 model ) , we do not expect sn  ii progenitors to generally occupy this color region [ @xmath56 to @xmath57 mag ] , since lower - mass stars are still on ( or are just barely off ) the main sequence and therefore not sufficiently evolved . also , we expect sn  ii - p progenitors to be red supergiants , since both the optical p - cygni spectral line profiles and the plateau phase of the sn light curve ( arising from a hydrogen recombination wave in the envelope ) require such extensive hydrogen envelopes . furthermore , the lack of radio emission from sn 2003gd ( c. j. stockdale et al .",
    "2003 , private communication ) implies a paucity of circumstellar matter , providing additional evidence that most of the progenitor s matter was still contained in the star itself at the time of explosion .    in figure 6",
    "we show the absolute magnitude and color for stars a and b from the combined _ hst _ and not photometry , again corrected for reddening to the sn and adjusted for the true m74 distance modulus . for comparison we again show the lejeune & schaerer ( 2001 ) evolutionary tracks , as in figure 5 ( for @xmath58 we also show the track corresponding to solar metallicity , @xmath59 ; as can be seen , little difference exists in the red between the tracks of different metallicity ) . from figure 6",
    "it appears that both stars are red supergiants , and that star a had an initial ( zero - age main sequence ) mass @xmath609 @xmath6 .",
    "the fainter star b appears to have had an initial mass @xmath61 , which is formally below the theoretical lower limit for core - collapse sne ( @xmath62 ; e.g. , woosley & weaver 1986 ) .",
    "one of the two stars is most likely the progenitor : the f606w detection limit , @xmath63 mag ( 3@xmath29 ) , when corrected for the true m74 distance modulus and assuming stars of the same reddening - corrected @xmath44 as stars a and b , corresponds to @xmath64 mag and therefore to initial masses well below the core - collapse limit .",
    "thus , we can probably rule out that the progenitor is not detected in the f606w image .",
    "although star a is farther from the sn position than star b , and just outside the edge of the error circle , we consider star a to be the most likely progenitor candidate , based on its estimated initial mass . from figure 2",
    "it also appears to be the most plausible candidate , being the brightest object in the @xmath4 band within the sn s larger , @xmath131 radius , environment .",
    "( although of comparable brightness to stars a and b in f606w , the four other stars mentioned in   2 which are outside , but near , the error circle do not have clearly identifiable counterparts on the @xmath4-band image , implying that these stars are bluer than stars a and b and can probably be discounted as progenitor candidates . ) the estimate for the sn 2003dg progenitor mass is lower than the limits derived for the nearby sne ii - p 1999gi ( @xmath65 ; leonard et al .",
    "2002b ) and 1999em ( @xmath66 ; leonard et al .",
    "2003 ) , but is consistent with that for the sn ii - p",
    "2001du ( @xmath67 ; van dyk et al .",
    "our estimates for the absolute brightness and initial mass for the sn 2003gd progenitor are consistent with those reported by smartt , maund , & hendry ( 2003b ) .",
    "examining _ hst _ archival wfpc2 images of the type ii - p sn 2003gd in m74 obtained before explosion , we have isolated two possible sn progenitor stars .",
    "although we can not exclude a blue sn progenitor , it is more likely that the progenitor was red .",
    "this is further supported by the brightness of the two stars on a ground - based archival @xmath4-band image .",
    "sn 2003gd is an old sn ii - p , and we have estimated that its reddening is quite low , @xmath2 mag , similar to that of the well - studied sn ii - p 1999em .",
    "we estimate that the more likely candidate of the two stars had an initial mass @xmath59 @xmath6 which , together with mass limits derived for other sne  ii - p , suggests that such sne ii - p arise from massive stars at the lower extreme of the possible mass range for core collapse",
    ".    it would be most fruitful to recover the sn in multiple bands with _ hst _ at high spatial resolution , preferably with acs , when the sn has significantly dimmed .",
    "this will allow us to pinpoint the sn s exact location on the preexplosion images and thus be definitive about the progenitor s identification .",
    "if our proposed candidate is confirmed , it will be only the sixth sn progenitor ever directly identified .",
    "additionally , the multiband imaging of the stars in the environment of the fading sn would provide possible further constraints on the age and mass of the progenitor star , based on the characteristics of its surviving neighbors .",
