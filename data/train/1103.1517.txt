    "such an approach is known as coda - wave interferometry in seismology and diffusive wave spectroscopy in acoustics @xcite . while the early developments of the technique were based on the use of repeating small earthquakes termed `` doublets '' @xcite , the possibility to reconstruct green s function from ambient seismic noise has given rise to a new technique termed passive image interferometry @xcite . in coda - wave interferometry ,",
    "temporal changes in the medium are detected by comparing the coda portions of the cross - correlation function of ambient noise , that were computed at different times .",
    "therefore , understanding the basic physical processes that allow the reconstruction of scattered waves from the cross - correlation of random noise sources is of interest in seismology and acoustics .",

    "for instance , general theorems on the reconstruction of green s function have been established for a variety of inhomogeneous , dissipative @xcite , and even non - reciprocal media @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient of seismic interferometry is green s theorem or its elastodynamic generalization , i.e. the rayleigh - betti reciprocity theorem @xcite .",

    "this scattering process entails a decrease of the total @xmath1 wave energy . for an incident wavefield at equipartition",
    "the two contributions cancel exactly .",
    "the same argument applies to the total @xmath2 energy . ]",
    "the reconstruction of green s function of a homogeneous elastic medium from random noise sources was previously studied by @xcite .",
    "these authors used a decomposition of the random wavefield into a sum of uncorrelated plane @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves at equipartition . in this paper",
    ", we gave a precise mathematical formulation of the equipartition condition in equation ( [ equipartition ] ) .",
    "using the dirac calculus , we can show the complete equivalence between the equipartition state and an excitation of the system by randomly oriented and homogeneously distributed uncorrelated forces . noting the relations :    @xmath282    we obtain : @xmath283 equation ( [ equivalence ] ) ,",
    "demonstrates that from the point of view of correlations , a white noise distribution of random forces and a wavefield at equipartition are equivalent .",
    "we may also illustrate this point with physical arguments .",
    "first we note that the radiation of energy by a single force can be evaluated from the far - field solutions . for the @xmath1-wave radiation , we multiply @xmath284 by the squared modulus of green s function @xmath285 as given by equation ( [ gprom ] ) .",
    "the procedure is the same for the @xmath2 wave radiation , except for the substitution @xmath286 .",
    "it follows that the ratio between the total @xmath2- and @xmath1- energy radiated by a force is @xmath287 , which rigorously coincides with the ratio of the equipartition state .",
    "a homogeneous distribution of randomly oriented forces will therefore generate @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves propagating in all possible directions with a local energy density of @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves satisfying the equipartition relation @xmath288 .",
    "thus we find that the force distribution ( [ randomforce1 ] ) guarantees the existence of the equipartition state and the reconstruction of green s function .",
    "it is important to note that the model of absorption that we have developed implies equality of the intrinsic quality factor between @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves .",
    "this assumption may not always be fulfilled in practice .",
    "if the absorption times of @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves are different , the @xmath1-to-@xmath2 energy ratio differs from that of the equipartition state and green s function reconstruction will be imperfect .",
    "the requirement of equipartition for the successful reconstruction of green s function of a heterogeneous medium has been widely noted . @xcite",
    "have studied numerically and theoretically the reconstruction of green s function of a heterogeneous , open medium illuminated by either random or deterministic sources .",
    "they gave a criterion based on time - reversal arguments to discuss the optimal arrangement of the sources .",
    "the reconstruction of green s function of a heterogeneous medium illuminated by an incident random wavefield at equipartition has been considered theoretically by @xcite for scalar waves . @xcite have demonstrated that when a cylindrical scatterer is illuminated by random plane @xmath1 and @xmath2 waves at equipartition in 2-d , the cross - correlation of the wavefield allows the reconstruction of the complete green s function , including the waves scattered by the cylinder . in the case of a distribution of sources on a remote surface enclosing the receivers and a 3-d isotropic and homogeneous heterogeneity",
    ", @xcite showed that the wavefield incident on the scatterer must obey an equipartition relation .",
    "their derivation supposes that the medium is free from absorption . in this work",
    ", we have generalized these results to an arbitrary , localized heterogeneity and have given an application to a point - scatterer . to make the link with previous investigations , we now consider the impact of a localized scatterer on the equipartition state . in figure",
    "[ balance ] , we present a detailed balance of the energy carried by each wave mode to show that equipartition is globally preserved in a scattering system .",
    "let us consider a bundle of plane @xmath1 waves coming from space direction @xmath289 with mean squared amplitude @xmath290 . upon scattering , the @xmath1 waves will be mode converted into @xmath2 waves propagating into direction @xmath279 .",
    "reciprocally , we may consider incident @xmath2 waves propagating in direction @xmath280 with mean - squared amplitude @xmath291 and mode converted into @xmath1 waves propagating in direction @xmath281 .",
    "let us now consider the balance of energy carried by @xmath1 waves in the scattering process : @xmath292 where @xmath293 denotes the total energy carried by @xmath1 waves . in equation ( [ eqbalance ] ) , the integrals are performed over all possible space directions @xmath279 and @xmath294 .",
    "the first term represents the rate of energy conversion from @xmath1 waves to @xmath2 waves in the scattering process .",
    "this contributes to a decrease to the total @xmath1 energy , hence the minus sign .",
    "the second term corresponds to the reciprocal process where @xmath1 energy increases because of the @xmath2 to @xmath1 mode conversions . for the description of the shear wave motion , we have chosen a basis of linear polarizations @xmath295 as illustrated in figure [ notation ] .",
    "other bases such as left - handed and right - handed circular polarizations are popular in optics . for a wavefield at equipartition the mean squared amplitudes are independent of the vectors @xmath279 and @xmath289 and satisfy the relations : @xmath296 , @xmath297 . because of the fundamental reciprocity relations of conversion scattering derived in equation ( [ reciprocityf ] ) , we find that the total energy carried by @xmath1 waves is constant , i.e. @xmath298 .",
    "this implies that equipartition is globally preserved by the introduction of a scatterer in the medium .",
    "this simple argument highlights again the link between green s function reconstruction and equipartition .    in this paper ,",
    "the link between symmetry relations in scattering and the reconstruction of green s function from random noise sources has been generalized to the case of elastic waves ( see @xcite for the acoustic case ) .",
    "using the dirac calculus , a number of previously known symmetry and reciprocity relations for the scattering amplitude have been derived in a systematic way @xcite .",
    "based on the general green s function reconstruction formula for stationary random noise sources , we have obtained a general form of optical theorem valid in both near and far - field , which incorporates the effect of a finite amount of absorption . we also show that the generalized optical theorem can be established from the scattering formalism in the limit of infinitesimal absorption .",
    "thus , the correlation properties of random wavefields offer an alternative approach to study scattering phenomena in heterogeneous media .",
    "the reconstruction of green s function in 3-d is illustrated with the simple case of a point - like heterogeneity embedded in an isotropic matrix .",
    "based on a regularization of the return free space green s function , we are able to sum the born series for such a defect . usual results of the formal boundary value problem for a small scatterer with an arbitrary density contrast are recovered in the low frequency limit . the point scatterer satisfies the generalized optical theorem , which in turn implies the reconstruction of green s function in the presence of random distribution of noise sources .",
    "the point scattering model offers an attractive approach to tackle more complex multiple - scattering media .",
    "such developments will be the topic of a separate publication .",
    "we would like to thank k. wapenaar for his detailed review , and for his suggestions to improve the clarity of the manuscript .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for drawing our attention to recent references on green s function retrieval .",
