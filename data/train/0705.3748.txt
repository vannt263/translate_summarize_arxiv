    "this note is inspired by john tantalo s planarity game @xcite ( another implementation is available at @xcite ) .",
    "an instance of the game is a straight line drawing of a planar graph with many edge crossings . in a move",
    "the player is able to shift one vertex of the graph to a new position ; the incident edges will be redrawn correspondingly . the objective is to achieve a crossing - free drawing in a possibly smaller number of moves .",
    "let us fix some relevant terminology . by a _ drawing",

    "the _ shift complexity _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath6 , is the maximum @xmath10 over all drawings of @xmath0 .",
    "our aim is a combinatorial and a complexity - theoretic analysis of the planarity game from the standpoint of a game designer .",
    "the latter should definitely have a library of planar graphs @xmath0 with large @xmath6 .",
    "generation of planar graphs with large @xmath1 is also of interest .",
    "though large obfuscation complexity does not imply large shift complexity ( see discussion in section [ s : concl].[oq : obfvsshift ] ) , the designer can at least expect that a large @xmath9 will be a psychological obstacle for a player to play optimally on  @xmath8 .",
    "a result of direct relevance to the topic is obtained by pach and tardos @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , they prove that even cycles have large shift complexity , namely , @xmath11 .",
    "we first address the obfuscation complexity . in section [ s : obf ]",
    "we relate this parameter of a graph to the distribution of its vertex degrees .",

    "the upper bound is provable by the same argument as above , where a 4-point set @xmath34 has 2 points in the @xmath36-point part of @xmath37 and 2 points in the @xmath38-point part .",
    "such an @xmath34 corresponds to 2 pairs of non - adjacent edges , at most 1 of which is crossing .",

    "the optimality of the constant @xmath90 is ensured by regular planar graphs ( i.e. , cycles and cubic , quartic , and quintic planar graphs ) .    as was already mentioned , for planar graphs we have @xmath91 , where the bound for @xmath43 can not be improved .",
    "however , for @xmath1 we can do somewhat better .",
    "[ thm : obfn2 ] @xmath14 for a planar graph @xmath0 on @xmath4 vertices .",

    "denote the number of triangular faces in @xmath95 by @xmath38 and note that @xmath96 .",
    "based only on facial triangles , let us estimate from below the number of non - crossing edge pairs in an arbitrary straight line drawing @xmath8 of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath97 denote the set of all pairs of adjacent edges occurring in facial triangles .",
    "here we have @xmath98 edge pairs which are non - crossing in @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , for each pair of edge - disjoint facial triangles @xmath99 we take into account pairs of non - crossing edges @xmath31 with @xmath32 from @xmath100 and @xmath33 from @xmath101 . since at most @xmath102 pairs of facial triangles can share an edge , there are at least @xmath103 such @xmath99 .",
    "we split this amount into two parts .",
    "let @xmath104 consist of vertex - disjoint @xmath99 and @xmath105 consist of @xmath99 sharing one vertex .",
    "as easily seen , every @xmath99 in @xmath104 gives us at least 3 edge pairs @xmath31 which are non - crossing in @xmath8 .",
    "every @xmath99 in @xmath105 contributes at least 2 pairs of non - adjacent edges and exactly 4 pairs of adjacent edges .",
    "however , 2 of the latter 4 edge pairs can participate in @xmath97 .",
    "we conclude that in @xmath8 there are at least @xmath106 non - crossing edge pairs .",
    "the factor of @xmath107 in the latter term is needed because an edge pair @xmath31 can be contributed by 4 triangle pairs @xmath99 .",
    "thus , @xmath108 since @xmath63 as a simple consequence of euler s formula , we have @xmath109 .",
    "as @xmath8 is arbitrary , the bound for @xmath1 follows .",
    "a basic fact about @xmath6 is that this number is well defined .",
    "[ thm : wfs ] every planar graph @xmath0 has a straight line plane drawing . in other words , @xmath110 if @xmath111 .",
    "if we seek for lower bounds , the following example is instructive despite its simplicity : @xmath112 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath113    [ thm : shift ] let @xmath0 be a connected planar graph on @xmath4 vertices .    if @xmath7 ( in particular , if @xmath0 is 3-connected ) and @xmath114 , then @xmath115 .",
    "if @xmath0 is 4-connected , then @xmath116 .",
    "there is an infinite family of connected planar graphs @xmath0 with @xmath117 and @xmath118",
    ".    item 1 follows from the fact that , under the stated conditions on @xmath0 , we have @xmath119 ( nishizeki - baybars @xcite ) .",
    "item 2 is true because every 4-connected planar @xmath0 is hamiltonian ( tutte @xcite ) and hence @xmath120 in this case .",
    "item 3 is due to the bound @xmath121 .",
    "the latter follows from the elementary fact of plane geometry stated in lemma [ lem : geom ] below .",
    "[ lem : geom ] for any finite set of points @xmath122 there are two points @xmath123 and @xmath124 such that the segments with one endpoint in @xmath125 and the other in @xmath122 do not cross each other and have no inner points in @xmath122 .",

    "the next question we address is this : how close is relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath27 ? by theorem [ thm : shift ] , if @xmath7 then both graph parameters are linear .",
    "however , if @xmath127 , the existence of a large matching is not the only cause of large shift complexity .",

    "using lemma [ lem : geom ] , it is not hard to show that @xmath136 .",
    "we now construct a drawing @xmath137 of @xmath128 with @xmath138 . put vertices @xmath139 in this order in a line and the remaining vertices @xmath140 somewhere else in the plane .",

    "fix an optimal way of untangling @xmath8 and denote the set of edges whose position was not changed by @xmath95 .",
    "clearly , @xmath95 is an independent set in @xmath157 and hence @xmath159 . on the other hand , @xmath160 .",
