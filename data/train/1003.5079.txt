    "phase oscillators are simple models of oscillatory activity where the essential variable is an angular position along a limit cycle .",
    "systems of coupled phase oscillators provide a convenient paradigm for studying the collective behavior of weakly interacting limit cycle oscillators @xcite and are in turn useful for modeling a wide variety of cooperative phenomena observed in biological , physical and chemical systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most well known models of coupled phase oscillators is the kuramoto model @xcite which considers a system of globally ( all - to - all ) coupled set of oscillators with a spread of intrinsic frequencies .",
    "the oscillators synchronize to a common frequency as soon as the coupling strength goes beyond a threshold value . for a system of identical oscillators",
    "one achieves phase synchrony where , starting from an initial random distribution of phases , all the oscillators acquire the same phase within a time that is inversely proportional to the coupling strength .",
    "when the members of the set of identical oscillators have a spatial identity ( e.g. when the coupling is of the nearest - neighbour kind or varies in strength over space ) the collective states can exhibit a broader class of phase - locking behaviour including acquiring the same phase ( synchrony ) or a fixed amount of phase difference between neighbouring oscillators ( traveling waves ) . for a nonlocally coupled continuous system of this kind it is also possible to sustain a more exotic state whereby phase - locked and incoherent activity can simultaneously exist at different spatial locations @xcite , giving rise to a spatio - temporal pattern that has been termed as a _ chimera state _ @xcite .",
    "while the original kuramoto model is based on the idealized assumption of instantaneous coupling between the oscillators , there has been a growing interest in extending the model to include finite time delay in the coupling and to study the existence and stability of phase - locked states in such a situation @xcite .",
    "time delayed coupling is physically relevant in many real life systems and accounts for finite propagation times of signals , reaction times of chemicals , individual neuron firing periods in neural networks etc .",
    "one of the earliest investigations in this direction was made by schuster and wagner @xcite who considered the collective states of a pair of delay - coupled phase oscillators and observed changes in the onset conditions for synchrony as well as the existence of additional ( higher ) branches of synchronized frequency states .",
    "niebur et al .",
    "@xcite considered a two - dimensional array of phase oscillators that interact via time delayed nearest neighbour coupling and found that time delay led to a reduction in the collective frequency of the system .",
    "their numerical studies also found higher frequency states which were metastable and decayed to the lowest branch in the presence of noise .",
    "kim et al @xcite studied multistability of synchronized and desynchronized states in a time - delayed kuramoto system in the presence of a pinning force . more recently",
    "yeung and strogatz @xcite have carried out a systematic stability study of the synchronous states of a delayed kuramoto system and have obtained analytic stability curves for the limiting case of coupled identical oscillators . since the original kuramoto model adopts a global coupling between the oscillators , its time - delayed version considered in all the above mentioned studies have assumed a single fixed amount of delay in the coupling . in a more realistic situation",
    "where the oscillators are spatially distributed and are coupled in a nonlocal fashion , such an assumption is not appropriate and one needs to consider distance - dependent delays .    models with distance - dependent delays have been proposed in the past and analyzed under simplifying assumptions or in convenient limits .",
    "crook et al .",
    "@xcite considered a continuum system of coupled identical oscillators with a spatially decaying interaction kernel and modeled the space dependent time delay contribution through an effective phase shift term in the interaction .",
    "they also took the size of the system to be infinite for mathematical convenience but thereby effectively reduced the nature of the mutual coupling to a `` local '' one ( since the interaction length is always much smaller than the system length ) .",
    "zanette @xcite studied another simplified version of the generalized system where he adopted a distance independent ( global ) coupling between the oscillators but introduced a distance dependent time delay in the interaction .",
    "he obtained numerical results on the stability of synchronous and propagating traveling waves and also some analytic results in the limit of small delay .",
    "ko & ermentrout @xcite recently investigated the effects of distance dependent delays in sparsely connected oscillator systems and found that a small fraction of connections with time delay can destabilize the synchronous states .",
    "we note that distance - dependent delays have also been considered in other related contexts , e.g. , in the stability of equilibria of continuum models of neural tissue with axonal propagation delays . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", however , there has been no systematic study of the synchronization properties of the full nonlocal system of phase oscillators with distance - dependent delays .",
    "our present work is motivated by a desire to address this problem .",
    "the presence of both non - locality and time delay in the coupling pose a formidable mathematical challenge for an analytic solution of the problem and one has to perforce adopt a numerical approach .",
    "in the recent past we have studied the generalized system to obtain _ chimera states _ in the presence of delay @xcite . in the present work",
    "we carry out a detailed study on the existence and stability properties of synchronous solutions of the system . through detailed stability curves in the parameter space of the mean time delay ( @xmath0 ) and the non - locality parameter ( @xmath1 ) ( for a fixed intrinsic oscillator frequency @xmath2 )",
    "we delineate the relative influence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the stability of the synchronous state whose frequency is @xmath3 . from an extensive scan over several frequencies",
    "@xmath2 , we further obtain a comprehensive stability diagram in the parameter space of @xmath4 and @xmath1 that is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "our numerical results further suggest that the instability mechanism corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation and the most unstable perturbation has the lowest mode number .",
    "these results help us obtain an analytic expression for the synchronization condition .",
    "the synchronization condition can be closely approximated by an offset exponential power law relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath1 , which is valid over a wide range of coupling regimes and provides a useful criterion for determining the critical value of the delay - induced maximum phase shift below which the synchronous state is stable .",

    "the quantity @xmath14 denotes the signal propagation speed which gives rise to a time delay of @xmath15 for distance @xmath16 from the locations @xmath9 . as the oscillators are located on a ring with circumference @xmath17 , the distance between any two oscillators is given by the shorter of the euclidean distance between them along the ring . in this configuration ,",
    "the maximum distance between the coupled oscillators is @xmath18 and thus the maximum time delay would be @xmath19 .",
    "we choose the coupling kernel @xmath20 to have an exponentially decaying nature and its normalized form is taken to be @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse of the interaction scale length and is a measure of the nonlocality of the coupling .",
    "we make time and space dimensionless in eqs.([pha ] ) and ( [ ker ] ) by the transformations @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 and obtain    @xmath29dz .",

    "the stability of these higher states will be discussed in later sections of the paper .",

    "we can also examine two simple limits of eq .",
    "( [ eqlbm ] ) which help us understand the influence of the non - locality parameter @xmath1 on the nature of the equilibrium solutions . for @xmath43 , corresponding to the global coupling limit , eq .",

    "@xcite considered such a limit but with an additional simplifying assumption regarding the contribution of the delay term : instead of explicitly treating the delay term in the argument of the phase function they modeled the delay contribution by a space dependent phase shift ( implicit delay ) .",
