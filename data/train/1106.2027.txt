    "type - ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are widely thought to be the thermonuclear detonations of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( wds ) whose masses are near the chandrasekhar limit @xcite .",
    "the route to achieve this mass and the conditions for explosion are in dispute ( see reviews by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . two main routes are discussed in the literature . in the single degenerate ( sd )",
    "scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) a wd grows in mass through accretion from a non - degenerate stellar companion . in the double degenerate ( dd )",
    "scenario ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent paper on sub - chandrasekhar mass remnants ) two wds merge after losing energy and angular momentum through the radiation of gravitational waves",
    ". observations and theoretical studies can not teach us yet whether both models for sne ia can work , only one of them , or none ( see recent summary by @xcite ) .",
    "the observations and theoretical results that favor and disfavor each scenario for the progenitors of sne ia are summarized by , e.g. , @xcite and more recently by @xcite . the main problem for the dd scenario ( see review by @xcite ) is that in many cases an off - center carbon ignition occurs ( e.g. , @xcite ) leading to accretion induced collapse ( aic ) where a neutron star ( ns ) is formed rather than a sne ia .",
    "@xcite raised the possibility that in a merger process where the more massive wd is hot , off - axis ignition of carbon is less likely to occur .",
    "the reason is that a hot wd is larger , such that its potential well is shallower and the peak temperature of the destructed wd ( the lighter wd ) accreted material is lower .",
    "hence , in such a case the supercritical - mass remnant is more likely to ignite carbon in the center at a later time , leading to a sn ia .",
    "namely , the merger remnant becomes a rapidly rotating massive wd , that can collapse only after it loses sufficient angular momentum .",
    "motivated by the possibility raised by @xcite , @xcite suggested recently that some sne ia might originate from a double degenerate merger that occurs at the end of the common envelope ( ce ) phase , rather than a long time after the ce phase as in the canonical dd scenario . practically , the merger is of a companion wd with the core of an agb star .",
    "the merger of a wd with the core of an agb star was proposed by @xcite .",
    "they consider the outcome to be a sn explosion that forms a ns , e.g. , type ii sn explosion .",
    "more relevant to this paper is the suggestion of @xcite that the merger of the wd with the agb core leads to a sn ia that occurs at the end of the ce phase or shortly after . in that case",
    "hydrogen lines will be detected .",
    "as @xcite aim was to explain the presence of hydrogen in a sn ia , they did not consider a delayed explosion . in this paper",
    "we discuss delayed explosion .",
    "@xcite noted also that for such a a merger to occur the agb star should be massive ( also @xcite ) .",
    "tout et al .",
    "( 2008 ) consider a merger of a wd with a core of an agb star to explain the formation of massive rotating wds with strong magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite commented that such wds might be more likely to form sne ia .",
    "either the companion wd is destructed and forms a disk around the hot core , or the more massive core is destructed ( because it is hot and large ) and forms an accretion disk around the wd . in the later case the lower mass wd has a shallower gravitational potential , hence the temperature in the accretion disk does not reach ignition temperature .",
    "@xcite termed this the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario . in the cd scenario",
    "the merger occurs in a ce with a massive agb star , or shortly ( @xmath4 ) after the ce phase , i.e. during the planetary nebula phase . because of its rapid rotation the super - chandrasekhar wd does not explode ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it will explode long after the merger , only after it has spun down to allow explosion .",
    "the cd scenario , including findings from this paper , is summarized schematically in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this scenario is completely different from the model of an explosion inside a ce with a low mass evolved star as proposed by @xcite that was subsequently criticized by @xcite .",
    "there are three key ingredients in the cd scenario , in addition to the common condition that the remnant mass be @xmath5 .",
    "( 1 ) the hot core is more massive than the companion cold wd . in a future paper we will conduct a population synthesis to find the expected number of such systems . ( 2 ) the merger should occur while the core is still large , hence hot .",
    "this limits the merger to occur within @xmath6 after the common envelope phase .",
    "@xcite showed that this condition can be met when the agb star is massive , and some of the ejected ce gas falls back .",
    "( 3 ) the delay between merger and explosion should be up to @xmath7 if this scenario is to account for sne ia in old - stellar populations , in addition to sne ia in young stellar populations .",
    "this is the subject of this paper .    in section [ sec : gradiation ]",
    "we examine the spinning - down time by gravitational waves .",
    "contrary to previous claims , we find that this time is very long , and might not be relevant to spin down wds , despite being very efficient in spinning down neutron stars ( ns ) . in section [ sec : long ] we show that it is quite plausible that magneto - dipole radiation torque can lead to a long delay of the explosion , up to @xmath8 . in section [ sec : distribution ] we constrain the properties of the core - wd merger product if the cd scenario is to account for a large fraction of sne ia .",
    "our discussion and summary are in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "as done by many authors ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) we consider the emission of gravitational waves due to r - modes in rotating wd progenitors of sne ia , but contrary to most of these and other works , we will find this mechanism to be inefficient .",
    "we note that @xcite considered gravitational waves from wds that have rotational to binding energy ratio of @xmath9 , and therefore are highly deformed .",
    "the wds we consider can not reach values of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we follow the derivation given by @xcite , where the assumptions and approximation can be found .",
    "we will take the mode @xmath10 , which is the most significant one .",
    "the velocity perturbation of the r mode is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic type vector spherical harmonic , the frequency is given by @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the stellar angular velocity and radius , respectively , and @xmath16 is the amplitude of the mode . from equations 14 - 17 in @xcite",
    "we derive the power , @xmath17 , of the gravitational radiation ( for @xmath10 , and written in a form that can be traced to their formulae ) @xmath18 we define the structural constant @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 for a constant density sphere of mass @xmath22 and radius @xmath15 .",
    "we also define the ratio of the angular velocity to the break - up angular velocity ( the keplerian angular velocity on the stellar equator @xmath23 ) @xmath24 with these definitions the gravitational radiation power becomes @xmath25    the moment of inertia is parameterized with the structural constant @xmath26 , @xmath27 where for a constant density sphere @xmath28 .",
    "we integrate for the structure of a massive wd model taken from @xcite , and find @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "assuming that all the power of the gravitational waves comes from the rotational kinetic energy , the spin - down timescale of the wd is given by integrating the equation @xmath31 , where a solid body rotation is assumed here .",
    "this gives the timescale for spinning down from an initial fast rotation @xmath32 down to a critical ( scaled ) angular velocity @xmath33 , @xmath34 = 10^{11 } \\left ( \\frac{\\beta_i / \\beta^2}{10 } \\right ) \\left(\\frac { m}{1.5 m_\\odot } \\right)^{-4 } \\\\",

    "this is quite large .",
    "here we raise the possibility that magnetic fields limit the growth of the r - mode to a degree that makes the gravitational radiation insignificant in spinning down wds .",
    "@xcite find that as the magnetic fields in nss become stronger , the lower limit on the rotation frequency for the development of r - modes instability becomes larger .",
    "in other cases the magnetic field limits the amplitude of the r - modes . in the calculations of @xcite an equipartition between the magnetic pressure and the mode energy density in the outer region",
    "is achieved where the density is about one per cent of the average density @xmath36 . using the same approximate equipartition , @xmath37 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath38 this is a huge magnetic field for a wd . before reaching this value",
    "the magnetic field will dissipate , and is likely to prevent the growth of the r - mode amplitude to a value of @xmath39 .",
    "our conclusion is that most likely gravitational waves from r - modes are not significant in spinning down wds .",
    "a misalignment between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis leads to a spin - down process due to magneto - dipole radiation torque that is commonly used for pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism was used for wds by @xcite , with the following expression for the spin - down time from an initial fast rotation @xmath32 down to a critical angular velocity @xmath33 , @xmath40 ( \\sin \\delta)^{-2 } \\approx   10^{8 } \\left(\\frac{b}{10 ^ 8 \\g}\\right)^{-2 } \\left(\\frac{\\tilde\\omega_{\\rm c}}{0.7 \\omega_{\\rm kep}}\\right)^{-2 } \\\\ & \\times \\left(\\frac{r}{4000 \\km } \\right)^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{\\sin \\delta}{0.1}\\right)^{-2 } \\left(\\frac{\\beta_i}{0.3}\\right ) \\left[1-\\left(\\frac{\\tilde{\\omega}_0}{\\tilde{\\omega}_c}\\right)^{-2}\\right ] \\yr , \\end{split } \\label{eq : taub}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis , and @xmath26 is defined in equation ( [ eq : betai ] ) .",
    "the scaling of @xmath41 at which the wd explodes is based on the results of @xcite for wd in the lower range ( @xmath42 ; also @xcite ) .",
    "the angular velocity distribution is not considered here in detail ; only in calculating the total angular momentum a solid body rotation is assumed . in a future paper",
    "this assumption will be relaxed .",
    "however , we do note that magnetic fields might enforce a solid body rotation in the wd @xcite .",
    "stabilizing rapidly rotating super - chandrasekhar wds is a delicate matter ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in the single degenerate scenario ) .",
    "the strong magnetic fields required in the present model most likely will enforce a rigid rotation within a short time scale due the wd being a perfect conductor .",
    "the critical mass of rigidly rotating wds is @xmath43 ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this implies that in the case of a strong dipole filed that exists in most of the their interior , wds more massive than @xmath43 will explode in a relatively short time .",
    "the exact time will be estimated in a future study .",
    "the similarity of most sn ia suggests that their progenitors indeed come from a narrow mass range .",
    "this is @xmath44 in the cd scenario .",
    "equations ( [ eq : taus ] ) , ( [ eq : bfield1 ] ) , and ( [ eq : taub ] ) bring us to consider the following scenario .",
    "massive wds , @xmath45 that can explode ( or collapse ) with higher angular momentum , do so on a typical time scale of @xmath46 ; most within a much sorter time .",
    "wds in the lower mass domain ( @xmath47 ) that explode with lower angular momentum and that on average have weaker magnetic fields might survive for a time of @xmath48 from their formation in a merger process .",
    "the exact time of explosion depends strongly on the magnetic field of the wd and the inclination angle .",
    "we can not constrain the value of these parameters and the evolution of the magnetic field during the spin - down process , as , for example , r - modes might amplify the magnetic field . however , in the next section we crudely constrain the distribution of the relevant parameters .",
    "in the previous two sections we have studied the evolution of a massive rapidly rotating wd that is a merger product of two wds , or an agb core with a wd , termed cd scenario for sne ia . the rapidly rotating wd does not collapse because of the centrifugal forces .",
    "once it spins down below the critical angular velocity @xmath49 , it becomes unstable and explodes as a sn ia ( @xcite ) .",
    "we now check the possibility that most of the sn ia are formed by the cd scenario , and use observations to constrain the properties of these sn ia progenitors .",
    "equation ( [ eq : taub ] ) for the spin - down time depends on 4 physical variables .",
    "the radius @xmath15 and the critical angular velocity @xmath50 will not differ much from one wd to another , as we are mainly interested in wds of masses @xmath51 that are rapidly rotating . the magnetic field and",
    "the inclination angle can vary by more than two orders of magnitude between different wds .",
    "for that , we write the spin - down time from equation ( [ eq : taub ] ) in the form @xmath52 where we defined what we term the magnetic - dipole parameter @xmath53    we now try to use observations to estimate the distribution of wds that are the remnants of core - degenerate mergers with respect to @xmath54 , under the assumption that most ( all ) sne ia are formed through this channel .",
    "maoz et al .",
    "( 2011 ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) summarize the sn ia rate versus time @xmath55 the delay time distribution ( dtd ) @xmath55 as found from observations @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and where @xmath58 is the time since the star formation event that formed the binary system that later became the sn progenitor .",
    "the last equation can be written as @xmath59 from equation ( [ eq : taub2 ] ) with @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 that when substituted into equation ( [ eq : dndt2 ] ) gives @xmath62    we recall that this result holds only for the massive wds that were formed from the merger of two lower mass wds during or shortly after a common envelope phase under the assumption that most sne ia are formed via the cd channel . equation ( [ eq : dndeta1 ] ) can be also written explicitly as @xmath63 where the range of @xmath64 comes from the range of @xmath65 of the observed sne rate @xcite and equation ( [ eq : taub ] ) .",
    "we note that magnetic fields in massive wds might be @xmath66 of their initial value at age of @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "if true , then the decay of the magnetic field should be taken into account for long delay times , but it does not pose a problem to the model .",
    "let us compare this results with observations .",
    "@xcite review the subject of magnetic wds .",
    "magnetic wds have magnetic fields in the range @xmath68 .",
    "this overlaps with the value assumed here .",
    "although many of them are called rapid rotators because they are much faster rotators than most wds , they are much slower than the spin rate required here .",
    "it is quite possible that super - chandrasekhar magnetic wds can be stabilized even if the surface spinning rate is lower than that assumed here , if a differential rotation is maintained inside the wd ( @xcite ) .",
    "another encouraging observational result is that magnetic wds tend to be more massive that non - magnetic wds @xcite . indeed ,",
    "out of the 16 magnetic wds with well determined mass reported by @xcite , two have masses of @xmath69 .",
    "this fraction is further discussed in the next section .",
    "in this paper we examined the delay time from merger to explosion of the core - degenerate ( cd ) scenario for sne ia .",
    "a key ingredient in this scenario is that the merger occurs while the more massive degenerate component is the core of an agb star or a planetary nebulae , e.g. , at the end of the common envelope phase or shortly after earlier studies of the merger of a wd with the core of an agb star are @xcite as a way to make a neutron star , @xcite as an evolutionary route for sne ia with hydrogen lines , @xcite as a way to make magnetic wds , and @xcite in relation to sne ia with long delay times as studied here .",
    "such a merger where the more massive wd is still hot , hence larger , is more likely to avoid an early off - center ignition of carbon @xcite ; an early off - center ignition leads to a nemgo wd instead of to a sn ia .",
    "the problem of off - center carbon ignition during merger of cold wds is the most severe problem of the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario for sne ia @xcite .",
    "the cd scenario avoids this problem . the remnant of the core - degenerate merger is a rapidly rotating wd .",
    "if its mass is super - critical it will explode after spinning - down to a critical angular velocity @xmath49 @xcite , and not necessarily in a very short time delay as in the scenario of @xcite where one is expect to observe hydrogen lines .    in section [ sec : gradiation ]",
    "we examined the spinning - down time by the commonly used gravitational waves mechanism .",
    "although this mechanism is know to be very efficient in spinning down neutron stars , we found that this mechanism is not efficient in spinning down wds ( eq . [ eq : taus ] ) .",
    "it can be efficient only if the amplitude of the r - modes becomes @xmath35 .",
    "this is a very large amplitude and the modes are likely to be damped by magnetic fields before reaching this value ( eq . [ eq : bfield1 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , in section [ sec : long ] we estimated the spinning - down time due to magneto - dipole radiation torque ( eq . [ eq : taub ] ) , and found it to operate over the required time scale of @xmath70 for plausible parameters of the massive rapidly rotating wd remnant of the core - degenerate merger .    if the cd scenario for sne ia is to explain most ( all ) sne ia , it should account for the delay time distribution ( dtd ) , i.e. , the sne ia rate versus time since their progenitor formation .",
    "using the observations as summarized by @xcite , we derive a crude distribution of the dipole parameter @xmath71 , where @xmath2 is the magnetic field and @xmath3 the inclination angle between the magnetic dipole axis and the rotation axis .",
    "this is given in equation ( [ eq : dndeta2 ] ) .    before the cd scenario can be accepted as one of the channels to form sne",
    "ia more detailed calculations should be done .",
    "we end with a summary of these calculations , and with some possible promising properties of this scenario .    1 .",
    "the claim of @xcite that when the massive wd in a merger is hot ( in the cd scenario it is the core of an agb star or of a planetary nebula ) , the off - center ignition of carbon is likely to be avoided , should be studied in more detail .",
    "this study should include the process where the more massive core is destructed ( because of its larger radius ) , and the lower mass wd becomes the core of the remnant .",
    "2 .   a population synthesis study is required to determine the number of core - wd mergers that lead to chandrasekhar and super - chandrasekhar mass remnants .",
    "this is a subject of a future paper .",
    "the first step was carried by @xcite who argued that the core - wd merger can be a common outcome of the common envelope phase with massive agb stars , @xmath72 .",
    "tout et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimated that about three times as many common envelope events lead to a merged core as to a cataclysmic variable .",
    "this is a high fraction .",
    "@xcite estimated that @xmath73 of all wds are magnetic wds .",
    "even if a small fraction of these merger products lead to sne ia , the cd scenario can account for a large faction of sne ia .",
    "the exact numbers will be derived in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the large fraction of massive stars that are in binary systems gives us hope that indeed the number of such systems might be adequate to explain most ( all ) sne ia .",
    "we note here that sne ia from wds masses much above the chandrasekhar mass , as observed in some cases , e.g. @xcite , are accounted for in the cd scenario .",
    "3 .   a detailed study of the spin - down time of the merger remnant due to the magneto - dipole radiation torque is required .",
    "here we showed that this can be a promising mechanism .",
    "the evolution of the magnetic field with time should be examined as well .",
    "it is expected that less massive remnant ( but still super - chandrasekhar ) will take longer time on average to spin down and explode .",
    "this might account for the finding that sne ia in older populations are less luminous ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this should be studied after the magneto - dipole radiation torque process is better explored .",
    "5 .   rapidly rotating wds",
    "have shallow density profile near the equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "shallow density profile favors incomplete silicon burning that is required by observations @xcite .",
    "this process deserved to be studied .",
    "eventually , rapidly rotating massive wds should be found .",
    "claims for massive rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized wds have already been made , e.g. see discussion by @xcite and @xcite . we can crudely estimate the expected number of such wds if the cd scenario account for most of sne ia , in the following way ( maoz , d. , private communication 2011 ) .",
    "the sn ia rate per unit stellar mass in sbc galaxies is @xmath74 @xcite . from the local stellar density of @xmath75 @xcite and the local wd density of @xmath76 @xcite , a number of stellar mass per wd of @xmath77 in the solar neighborhood is obtained .",
    "if these wds are to explode within @xmath7 with a time time delay distribution of @xmath78 in the range @xmath79 , then their average age is @xmath80 , and the fraction of sn ia progenitors should be @xmath81 of all wds .",
    "namely , in a sample of @xmath82 wds in the solar neighborhood the number of rapidly rotating massive wds should be @xmath83 . as @xmath73 of all wds",
    "are magnetic @xcite , it is expected that @xmath84 of the magnetic wds will be massive enough to become sne ia .",
    "this is a prediction of this model . indeed ,",
