    "the 3@xmath0 transition metal oxides have been extensively studied as typical examples of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "one of the most fascinating features is represented by a mott insulator which emerges as a result of strong electron correlations beyond the single - particle band theory .",
    "@xcite the most extensively studied systems are high - temperature cuprate superconductors where high - temperature superconductivity ( sc ) has been observed by introducing mobile carriers into mott insulators  @xcite and subsequently various novel concepts have been proposed including unconventional sc ,  @xcite various symmetry broken orders ,  @xcite and pseudogap phenomena .",
    "@xcite the study of strongly correlated electron systems enlarges our fundamental knowledge of quantum states of matters and therefore search for novel mott insulators is valuable for further progress in condensed matter physics .    recently , 5@xmath0 transition metal oxide sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 with the layered perovskite structure  @xcite has attracted much attention as a candidate for a novel mott insulator .",
    "@xcite in this material , three @xmath3 orbitals of ir atom are hybridized among themselves with a large relativistic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , inherent in @xmath4 transition metal , and are occupied nominally by five @xmath4 electrons . because of this quantum entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of freedom , an effective total angular momentum @xmath5=@xmath6 state is stabilized locally at each ir atom .",
    "@xcite the coulomb interactions are generally believed to be smaller compared with the whole band width of the bands formed by @xmath3 orbitals in 5@xmath0 systems . however , when the @xmath7 state forms a band and this band is detached from the rest of the bands due to a large soc , the width of the @xmath7 band is narrower and comparable to the coulomb interactions , which thus can induce a novel @xmath7 insulating state .",
    "this picture is indeed supported in sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite further experiments have revealed various interesting properties of this insulator  @xcite and its ba counterpart of ba@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite moreover , theoretical studies have proposed several novel features such as possible sc and a topological insulator .",
    "@xcite however , the origin of the @xmath7 insulating state is still under debate .",
    "while the mott - type mechanism ( i.e. , a strongly correlated insulator ) has been originally proposed ,  @xcite recent reports have suggested the slater - type mechanism ( i.e. , a weakly correlated insulator )  @xcite as well as both characters coexisting in sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite the difficulty of this problem is due to the fact that the coulomb interactions and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order can both split the band and make the system insulating .",
    "the aim of this paper is to clarify the insulating mechanism of sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 from the microscopic point of view by considering the energy gain mechanism .    in a mott insulator ,",
    "the coulomb interactions are responsible for the insulating behavior and the insulating gap is determined essentially by the energy difference between the upper and lower hubbard bands , where the af order has only a secondary effect . to the contrary , in a slater insulator , the translational symmetry breaking af order induces the insulating behavior and thus very often the band structure is essential for its stability . in the experiments on sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 , the temperature dependence of the resistivity is found insulating up to 600  k and no significant change is observed at the nel temperature ,  @xcite strongly suggesting that sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 is a mott - type insulator . theoretically , however , the insulating mechanism in a multi - orbital hubbard system with a large soc has not been explored in general and therefore the systematic study is highly desired .    in this paper , using a variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method , we study the ground state properties of a three - orbital hubbard model with a large soc on the square lattice and examine the insulating mechanism of sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 .",
    "we find that in the ground state phase diagram with one hole per site the insulating state is always af ordered and changes its character from a weakly correlated ( slater - type ) insulator to a strongly correlated ( mott - type ) insulator as the coulomb interactions increase .",
    "these insulating states are differentiated in the energy gain mechanism which favors the af insulator over a paramagnetic state , i.e. , an interaction - energy driven slater - type insulator and a band - energy driven mott - type insulator .",
    "we also find that there exists an intermediate region where both energy gain mechanisms work due to the strong renormalization of the paramagnetic metallic state .",
    "based on our results , we attribute sr@xmath1iro@xmath2 to be a  moderately correlated \" af insulator located between a slater - type and a mott - type insulators .",
