    "it is known that several materials exhibit fermionic excitations with linear dispersion relation close to the fermi level , which can be effectively described in terms of @xmath0dimensional dirac fermions .",
    "early examples include systems displaying integer quantum hall effect @xcite and _ d - wave superconductors _",
    "@xcite and more recently _ graphene _ @xcite and _ topological insulators _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the case of graphene at half filling it has been observed @xcite that the _ optical _ conductivity ( for frequencies greater than the temperature ) is essentially constant in a wide range of frequencies and very close to the _ universal _ value @xmath1 , which also happens to be the value found for the system of non - interacting @xmath2 dirac fermions @xcite , a remarkable result in view of the fact that interactions are not particularly weak . in transport measurements",
    "an _ universal _ value for the conductivity is also found , of order of the conductivity quantum @xmath3 @xcite ; again a surprising result in view of the presence of disorder which is surely relevant in such experiments .",
    "it is of course important to understand if and under which conditions such universality can be understood theoretically . in presence of weak short range interactions , after first perturbative computations claiming non vanishing corrections , it was finally rigorously proved @xcite that the optical conductivity is _ exactly equal _ to its non interacting value .",
    "note that the emerging description is in terms of a nambu - jona lasinio model and the natural cut - off provided by honeycomb lattice ensures the correct symmetries and allows the proof of the complete cancellation of the interaction corrections . on the other hand , in the case of _ long range _",
    "coulomb interaction it has been predicted that the optical conductivity is still equal to the non interacting value @xcite , the argument this time being based on the divergence of the fermi velocity .",
    "however , the fermi velocity divergence found in the coulomb case at very low frequencies is clearly rather unphysical , and simply signals ultimate inadequacy of the usual model of instantaneous coulomb interaction . with the increase of the fermi velocity",
    "the retardation effects eventually become important , so that the retarded current - current interaction must be added to the coulomb density - density interaction ; the emerging model is in this case @xmath4 ( with an ultraviolet cut - off ) in which the fermionic velocity is different from the light velocity .",
    "such system have been analyzed before in @xcite , @xcite and it was found that the flow of the fermi velocity stops at the velocity of light @xmath5 , and , maybe most importantly , that the coupling constant ( i. e. the charge ) in the theory is _ exactly _ marginal ( anomalous critical exponents are found ) ; as a consequence of that , the optical conductivity is _ not _ equal to its non interacting value but corrections are found @xcite , which are however quite small and still universal at lowest order ( they depend only only from the fine structure constant ) .    when we turn to the analysis of the effect of disorder on the conductivity , the natural emerging description is in terms of _ disordered dirac fermions _ , which were extensively analyzed along the years",
    "in the case of _ chiral preserving disorder _",
    "it was found that the density of states is vanishing with a critical exponent ( non trivial function of the disorder strength ) but the conductivity is _ universal _ and not depending from the disorder amplitude , see @xcite . such results , obtained using the replica trick , were confirmed and extended by a supersymmetric analysis of such models @xcite leading to a functional integral in bosonic and grassmann variables and a _ local _ quartic interaction .",
    "it is rather natural to relate such results to the universal conductivity found by transport measurements in graphene @xcite , despite the understanding of why the dominant disorder in graphene should preserve chirality is an open issue which may be related to how the sample is produced .",
    "however , even assuming that disorder preserves chirality , several questions still remain to be understood . the results in @xcite on dirac fermions with disorder where found assuming _ delta correlated _ disorder and an unbounded fermionic dispersion relation ( no ultraviolet cut - offs )",
    ". such features makes an exact analysis possible ( even non perturbative , see @xcite and references therein ) but produce _ ultraviolet divergences _ similar to the one present in local quantum field theory in @xmath6 ( for instance in the thirring model ) , which could lead to some discrepancy with respect to lattice models ( see @xcite and the discussion in @xcite ) which are of course free from ultraviolet divergences . as the dispersion relation ( in graphene or in the other condensed matter applications )",
    "is approximately conical ( `` relativistic '' ) only in a small region around the fermi level , it is natural to consider the presence of a momentum cut - off ; moreover , a _ short - range _ correlated disorder is a much more realistic description for condensed matter systems , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "both such features make disordered dirac fermions _",
    "free _ from ultraviolet divergences , and it is therefore natural to ask if the results with no cut - off and @xmath7-correlated disorder are sufficiently robust to persists under the above more realistic conditions .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .   in the case of short range disorder ,",
    "if the momentum cut - off is removed the density of states vanishes with a critical exponent and the conductivity is universal ; that is , the system has the same qualitative behavior than the case of @xmath7-correlated disorder .",
    "if the momentum cut - off is not removed , the density of states is still anomalous but the conductivity has in general disorder - dependent corrections .",
    "therefore , the vanishing of the density of states with an anomalous exponent is a robust property for chiral disordered fermions , but the _ exact _ vanishing of the disorder corrections to the conductivity does not survive in general to the presence of a momentum cut - off . from a renormalization group point of view",
    "this is rather natural . in presence of chiral disorder",
    "the theory is _ marginal _ with a line of fixed points ; therefore corrections are expected , as in the case of the optical conductivity in presence of e.m . interaction . from this perspective , it is the _ absence _ of corrections the more surprising feature of disordered dirac fermions with no cut - off ; as it will be clear from the subsequent analysis , it is a direct consequence of the validity of the adler - bardeen theorem and the exact cancellation of the chiral anomaly due to the supersymmetry , which is valid only when the momentum cut - off is removed .",
    "the presence of corrections to the conductivity in presence of an ultraviolet cut - off may have of course implications for the physics of graphene , in which a natural ultraviolet cut - off is provided by the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the presence of momentum cut - off and of non local disorder prevents the use of any _ exact _ methods , like the ones adopted in @xcite , and one has therefore to rely on functional integral methods , which are more lengthy but of more general applicability . in particular we will use multiscale methods based on wilsonian renormalization group ( rg ) , in the more advanced form used in constructive quantum field theory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "such form is exact , in the sense that the irrelevant terms ( in the technical rg sense ) are fully taken into account , while in most non exact rg implementations the irrelevant terms are simply neglected ; as non local disorder or finite cut - offs are irrelevant in the infrared regime , non exact rg can not distinguish between local and non local disorder , or the presence or absence of an ultraviolet cut - off .",
    "using the supersymmetric formalism we can rewrite disordered dirac fermions in terms of functional integrals .",
    "the fermionic sector strongly reminds the _ non local thirring model _ which was constructed using a multiscale analysis respectively in @xcite for the ultraviolet problem and in @xcite for the infrared part ; therefore restricting to the fermionic sector a full non - perturbative construction of the model can be achieved , in the sense of a proof of the well definiteness of the functional integrals removing cut - offs ; this would be parallel to @xcite , in which the restriction to the bosonic sector of an hyperbolic sigma model coming by a disordered electron system was constructed .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in ",
    "2 we define the model and we explain its supersymmetric representation . in ",
    "3 we analyze the critical theory at @xmath8 , we derive ward identities and we show the validity of the adler - bardeen theorem and the supersymmetric cancellation of the anomalies in the limit of removed ultraviolet momentum cut - off ; also , the relation with universality will be explained . in ",
    "4 we consider the non critical theory @xmath9 and we discuss the infrared problem . finally , in  5 the main conclusions are discussed .",

    "the condition @xmath24 ensures that the only remaining pole is the one at @xmath29 , so preventing the fermionic species multiplication but at the same time preserving the chiral symmetry .",
    "the role of the lattice cut - off is just to make the functional integrals appearing below well defined and it will removed first .",
    "it is well known , see for instance @xcite , that the average of the two - point function and the average of the product of two functions can be represented in terms of a supersymmetric functional integral in the chiral basis .",
    "one introduces a finite set of grassmann variables @xmath30 with @xmath31 and defines , if @xmath32 , the grassmann integration by d^_ , ^_,=1d^_,=0 where @xmath33 is another set of grassmann variables . therefore if @xmath34 we can write |_ ,-",

    "the situation is different ; the non locality of the disorder induces an _ improvement _ in the scaling dimension , and indeed no ultraviolet divergences are present ; the kernels of the effective potential are bounded uniformly in the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath84 .",

    "has negative dimension while regarding the other term one has simply to use that the bound for @xmath152 as an extra @xmath153 .",

    "therefore    1 .   the local part of the terms with four fields with the same @xmath155 is vanishing ; indeed if @xmath112 is the order there are @xmath156 @xmath157-propagators and @xmath112 @xmath158-propagators ; then by @xmath159 so that @xmath160 ; moreover by global phase invariance there is an even number of fields with the same @xmath161 .",

    "the outcome of this procedure is a sequence of @xmath176 with kernels @xmath177 , expressed in terms of the effective coupling constants @xmath178 , @xmath179 ; the kernels are finite uniformly in @xmath180 provided that the running coupling constants stay bounded . on the other hand the running coupling constants are the same in the critical theory at @xmath8 . therefore in order to study their flow can consider the theory with @xmath8 and infrared cut - off @xmath181 , replacing @xmath17 with @xmath182 with @xmath142 .",
    "the schwinger - dyson equations for the two and four point function coincide with the ones derived in the previous sections up to negligible corrections due to the presence of the infrared cut - off @xmath181 . therefore fixing the value of the external momenta at the scale of the infrared cut - off we get _h-1,i = _0,i+o(_0 ^ 2 ) z_h^()=1+o(_0 ^ 2)[x1 ] and @xmath183 .",
    "this means that the effective couplings @xmath184 converge to a line of fixed points ( the beta function is asymptotically vanishing ) and the critical exponent for the wave function renormalization is zero ( contrary to what happens in the fermionic theory in which is positive ) .",
    "the flow equation for the energy is given by = 1+a_1,h+o(_h^2)=1+a_2,h+o(_h^2 ) with @xmath185 and by symmetry the contributions with different @xmath186 do not mix , by the global phase symmetry valid at @xmath8 .",
    "therefore e^()_h= e 2 ^ -_h with @xmath187 ; this implies @xmath188 . for @xmath189",
    "this makes clear why the second term in has the correct scaling dimension ; indeed @xmath190 can be bounded by @xmath191 which is sufficient to make the dimension negative .",
