    "if a liquid is cooled below its melting temperature the liquid will exist in a metastable state until a nucleation event occurs .",
    "if the source of nucleation in the undercooled melt is only due to fluctuation phenomena the nucleation is called homogeneous . in classical nucleation theory a spherical shape for the critical nuclei is assumed and its size is determined as a result of competition between the bulk free energy reduction and interfacial energy increase . if @xmath0 is the volume , @xmath1 the surface area , @xmath2 the chemical free energy change per unit volume and @xmath3 the specific interfacial energy , the free energy change according to the formation of a new phase is given by @xmath4 .",
    "for a spherical shape with radius @xmath5 we thus obtain @xmath6 .",
    "the radius @xmath7 of the critical nucleus must then be such that @xmath8 with the critical free energy of formation of a critical nucleus @xmath9 .",
    "this classical theory has been utilized to interprete kinetics of many phase transformations and have had some success for providing good descriptions on the nucleation kinetics for various systems . on the other hand , nucleation is generally significantly more complicated .",
    "the shape might not be spherical due to an anisotropy of the interfacial energy between a nucleus and the bulk phase , which results from the crystallographic nature of a solid nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the bulk properties of small nuclei may differ from bulk values typically obtained from larger samples . to account for these phenomena various new attempts in the context of diffuse interface models",
    "have been made to describe nucleation .",
    "such a non - classical theory was pioneered by cahn and hilliard @xcite . for subsequent studies , generalizations and specific applications to nucleation , we refer to @xcite and the references therein . in these studies",
    "an order parameter is used to distinguish between the nucleus and the bulk phase .",
    "since nucleation takes place by overcoming the minimum energy barrier , a critical nucleus is defined as the order parameter fluctuation which has the minimum free energy increase among all fluctuations which lead to nucleation .",
    "therefore , the critical nucleus can be found by computing the saddle points of the energy functional of the order parameter , that has the highest energy in the minimum energy path ( mep ) , which is the path whose highest energy is the lowest among all possible paths .",
    "this is consistent with the large deviation theory which states that the most probable path passes through the saddle point in the large time limit .",
    "an efficient numerical approach for finding minimum energy paths and saddle points , the so - called string methods ( sm ) , has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "the method is related to the nudged elastic band ( neb ) method @xcite .",
    "other approach are e.g. the minimax method , which as been used in @xcite or a phase - field type approach , as used in @xcite in the context of nucleation .",
    "we will here apply a simplified string method ( ssm ) @xcite but not on an underlying diffuse - interface model but a more detailed phase - field - crystal model @xcite , which accounts for the discrete effects on the small length scales involved in nucleation .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the phase - field - crystal model as a local approximation of a classical dynamic density functional theory . in sec .",
    "3 we describe the used string method . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss implementational issues . in sec . 5",
    "we show results for homogeneous nucleation .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) model is by now widely used in order to describe solid - state phenomena on atomic length scales .",
    "the pfc model was first developed in @xcite and then subsequently applied to many situations like interfaces @xcite , polycrystalline pattern formation @xcite , commensurate - incommensurate transitions @xcite , edge dislocations @xcite , grain boundary pre - melting @xcite , colloidal solidification @xcite and dislocation dynamics @xcite .",
    "the model resolves the atomic - scale density wave structure of a polycrystalline material and describes the defect - mediated evolution of this structure on time scales orders of magnitude larger than molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations . in its simplest form the pfc model results from the energy @xmath10 = \\int_\\omega - |\\nabla \\varphi|^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\delta \\varphi)^2 + f(\\varphi ) \\ ; dx\\ ] ] with @xmath11 a potential , @xmath12 the number density and @xmath13 a parameter determining the approximation of the liquid structure factor  @xcite . comparing the energy with a classical phase - field type energy ,",
    "e.g. @xmath14 for an order parameter @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a length scale determining the width of a diffuse interface and @xmath17 a double well potential , the difference is in the sign of the gradient term and the additional higher order term .",
    "the negative sign in the gradient term favors a changes in @xmath12 , whereas the higher order term favors to suppress such changes .",
    "the competition between both terms introduces a fixed length scale for which the energy will be minimized .",
    "this length scale is used to model the periodicity of a crystal lattice .",
    "the formulation used here favors a hexagonal closed packed structure in two dimensions . due to the underlying periodicity ,",
    "several solid state phenomena such as elasticity , plasticity , anisotropy and multiple grain orientations are naturally present in the formulation .",
    "the dynamic law constructed to minimize the free energy follows as the @xmath18-gradient flow of the energy @xmath19 with chemical potential @xmath20}{\\delta \\varphi}$ ] and the variational derivative given by @xmath21}{\\delta \\varphi } = \\delta^2 \\varphi + 2 \\delta \\varphi + f^\\prime(\\varphi).\\ ] ] this defines the pfc model and its evolution is by construction towards a ( meta ) stable state .",
    "although this formulation is phenomenologically , the pfc model can be derived starting from a smoluchowski equation via dynamic density functional theory using various approximations @xcite . with an appropriate parameterization it thus provides also a quantitative atomic theory , operating on diffusive time scales . within new developments",
    "@xcite quantitative agreement in computed properties could be achieved using the pfc model for various materials .",
    "it thus provides an ideal model to study nucleation .",
    "the dynamics shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) describe the evolution towards equilibrium of a single state @xmath12 in phase space according to the generalized thermodynamic force @xmath22 .",
    "but in order to characterize nucleation the most likely transition path between ( meta ) stable states has to be identified . in the description of such a non equilibrium process",
    ", the minimum energy path ( mep ) plays a crucial role .",
    "the mep is a path in phase space that connects ( meta ) stable states . a path in phase space is thereby defined as @xmath23 \\right\\ } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath24 a parameterization of the path .",
    "for the mep the generalized thermodynamic force @xmath22 is tangential to this path : @xmath25 thus , using the dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , any state of the mep will always evolve along the mep towards a stable state . that is , the mep is a real reaction path in phase space and along the mep the energy is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:0 ] ) . the local energetic maxima and minima along the mep can be used to determine the nucleation barrier and the critical nucleus .",
    "the string method ( sm ) is been designed to find the mep .",
    "it evolves a given chain of states towards the mep , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for illustration .      a path in phase space @xmath26",
    "is represented by a discrete set of states @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath28 the length of the path is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 measures the distance between two states and is defined by the @xmath31-norm .",
    "thus , the normalized tangent @xmath32 to the path at state @xmath27 may be calculated as @xmath33 .",
    "the idea behind the sm is to minimize the free energy of all single states according to @xmath34 but restricting the evolution to orthonormal direction of the path .",
    "in addition a tangential force is included in order to keep the quality of the representation of the path by the string . @xmath35 the langrang multipliers @xmath36 are e.g. uniquely determined by forcing an equidistant distribution of states along the path .",
    "@xmath37 is a fictitious timestep and controls the velocity of evolution .",
    "( [ eq - sm ] ) defines the string method .",
    "it is easily seen that the mep @xmath38 is an invariant according to the dynamics of sm . by definition of the mep ,",
    "the thermodynamic force is only tangential to the path .",
    "the constraints introduced by the tangential force do not alter the path , but only reparameterize the representation of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath39 and @xmath40 represents the same path in phase space .    in order to implement the sm the thermodynamic force has to be calculated and projected to the orthogonal direction of the path .",
    "furthermore the langrange multipliers have to be calculated . in order to simplify the calculation",
    "the sm can be divided in two steps leading to a simplified string method ( ssm ) .",
    "first the string is evolved due to the thermodynamic force and then the path is reparameterized , see @xcite .",
    "that is , the states representing the path @xmath41 are replaced by equally distant states , that represent the same path @xmath42 .",
    "this new states are constructed by interpolation between the original states @xmath43 . as in every evolution step",
    "there is a parameterization step , it is no longer necessary to project the thermodynamic force .",
    "thus the ssm is defined by two steps :    1 .",
    "evolution step : @xmath44 2 .",
    "reparameterization step : @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 representing the same path in phase space .    here",
    "the reparameterization is done to force equidistant states on the path .",
    "however , the reparameterization may also be changed to account for problem specific details , e.g. to get finer representation at the saddle point .",
    "the advantage of ssm over sm is that the thermodynamic force has not to be projected .",
    "additionally it is shown that this modification leads to a more stable and accurate method @xcite .      in the above",
    "defined ssm an initial path in phase space is evolving towards the mep .",
    "the first and the last state representing the path thereby converge to different ( meta ) stable states .",
    "the saddle point or here the critical nucleus is defined by the state of highest energy in the mep . if there is only one energetic maximum and the saddle point is well defined , the mep could be calculated easily by just solving the time evolution of a small perturbation of the critical nucleus towards the stable states according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "thus , only two time dependent simulations have to be done .",
    "therefore , it is enough to find the saddle point to reconstruct the whole mep efficiently . in order to concentrate the simulation effort to find only the saddle point",
    ", we introduce a fixed length simplified string method ( flssm ) .",
    "the total length of the string is restricted by the reparameterization step .",
    "assume that we allow a maximal length of the string , @xmath48 .",
    "for simplicity we also assume that the first state converges towards a stable state .",
    "then , the reparameterization can always project the states back to a string beginning with the first state with length @xmath48 .",
    "the last state is not converging to a meta stable state , but might be some unstable state but within a different basin .",
    "this state can be used to reconstruct the whole mep by a time evolution according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the same idea can be used at the same time on both sides of the saddle point , by fixing a state near the saddle point and restricting the length on both sides of the path . as we need some information about the string length and the position of the saddle point , we use the flssm in order to refine and improve accuracy of a mep which was calculated by the standard ssm with only a few states .",
    "the method can be viewed as an adaptive approach which efficiently finds the saddle point within a given tolerance .",
    "the string is a set of density distribution @xmath42 .",
    "as we consider a closed system and have mass conserving dynamics , we have to restrict the possible states representing a string to the same mean density , @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "for every state the standard dynamics has to be solved according to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) . the partial differential equation of 6th order",
    "is splitted into a set of three second order equations : @xmath51 for which a stable semi - implicit finite element discretization is introduced in @xcite .",
    "we use this approach but with higher order elements .",
    "the algorithm is implemented in the adaptive finite element toolbox amdis @xcite .",
    "the fictitious timestep is adjusted such that the reparameterization step can be done mostly considering only neighbouring states and such that the evolved state is substantial different from the previous one .    in this work",
    "we use linear interpolation between the states .",
    "we define the length of the string up to state m in analogy to @xmath52 for the whole string by @xmath53 .",
    "the distance between states after reparameterization is @xmath54 .",
    "then the reparameterized state @xmath27 at @xmath55 is constructed by linear interpolation using the neighboring states of @xmath27 from @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57    the flssm is implemented in a parallel way .",
    "that is , every state define a process and the evolution step is calculated in parallel .",
    "the result is then send to the nodes of the neighbouring states . in order to avoid complicated communication between the processes ,",
    "the reparameterization step is further simplified .",
    "the linear interpolation described above is used if the reparameterized state is in between the neighbouring states .",
    "if not , the reparameterized state is set to one of the neighbouring sites .",
    "@xmath58 this does not alter the mep but only the dynamic of the string in phase space , as long as we choose the fictitious timestep in a way that for pathes near the mep at the end of simulation always linear interpolation between neighbouring sites can be used .",
    "we define convergence of the method if the string changes only in tangential direction .",
    "this is ensured by two criteria .",
    "first , the change in string length and the change in energy in every state after reparameterization is below a given tolerance which ensures no change of the string in normal direction . the second criteria accounts for the change in tangential direction and ensures the evolution towards the ( meta ) stable states .",
    "therefore the fictitious time step is adjusted to evolves the states substantially far but still allowing for linear interpolation with @xmath59 .",
    "if the second criteria is not fullfilled , the fictitious time step is adapted .",
    "due to small thermodynamic forces near the saddle point , the second criteria may be relaxed for states very close to the saddle point .",
    "we consider as a proof of concept the nucleation of a crystal grain in an undercooled liquid .",
    "the parameters needed in the pfc model , eq . ( [ eq:1 ] ) , are the mean value of the density , @xmath60 and the parameter @xmath13 , which can be interpreted as a driving force of the phase change , e.g. undercooling @xcite or strength of interaction @xcite . in our example",
    "we choose parameters in the coexistence region of the phase diagram @xmath61 . for this parameter",
    "the liquid is a meta stable state .",
    "the stable state is a grain in coexistence with liquid .",
    "the grain is slightly anisotropic and there is a small density difference between crystal and liquid , see @xcite .    in order to calculated",
    "the mep an initial string @xmath62 has to be defined such that the mean density of every state is equal @xmath63 and that the first and the last state evolve towards two different ( meta ) stable states . in our work ,",
    "we use two different initial strings to demonstrate that the obtained mep is independent of the initial configuration . in the first example we set the first state to liquid @xmath64 and the last state to the equilibrium shape of the grain . the states in between",
    "are then constructed by linear interpolation . in the second example , every state was set homogeneous and disturbed by white noise @xmath65 such that @xmath66 . the strength of the noise @xmath67 , was linearly increased starting from @xmath68 to represent the liquid state towards a large value , which ensures evolution within the coexistence regime .",
    "both initial strings converge to the same mep shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - mep ] . in order to proof stability of the obtained mep",
    "every state was disturbed independently by some random field and than taken as a initial string to recalculate the mep .",
    "the first state corresponds to liquid and the last to a grain in coexistence with the liquid .",
    "the grain equilibrium is energetically favourable compared to the liquid and is the stable state in phase space .",
    "the liquid state is meta stable .",
    "the nucleation barrier or the saddle point is found at normalized string length of approx .",
    "states right to the saddle point correspond to growing crystallites and left to melting crystallites .",
    "the string was discretized by 94 states which are equally distributed , so the region around the nucleation barrier is resolved only by 10 states . in order to get a better resolution the flssm",
    "the length of the string is therefore restricted to @xmath70 of the original length of the mep and is rediscretized by 46 states , which are constructed by linear interpolation of the calculated mep .",
    "we can view this as an adaptive method to increase the accuracy of the calculated saddle point or a proof that the obtained saddle point is independent of the used parameterization of the string . in our example",
    "this independency is shown .",
    "[ fig - mep2 ] shows the obtained nucleation barrier @xmath71 and critical nucleus .",
    "the critical nucleus is defined by the state indicated by ( c ) , @xmath72 .",
    "( b ) indicates @xmath73 a sub critical state , which most likely will melt .",
    "( d ) - ( f ) indicate states @xmath74 - @xmath75 which correspond to super critical states which will solidify .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig - grain ] the density field of the labeled states are shown .",
    "the critical nucleus is a hexagonal cluster with only seven maxima .",
    "a small perturbation of this state will lead either to growth towards the equilibrium shape or to melting .",
    "the grow is symmetric and can be seen more quantitative in fig .",
    "[ fig - prof ] , which shows the density profile along the x - axis in the various states of the growth process .",
    "the density plot shows that the maximum amplitude of the critical nucleus is smaller than in the final bulk state .",
    "this can correspond to defects in the crystal , as we consider here only a mean - field description , or weaker ordering of particles . in both cases",
    "this shows that the critical nucleus has different structure and bulk energy than the corresponding bulk state .",
    "nucleation thus begins with a disturbance that reflects the crystal structure but has a small amplitude . during growth the spatial size of the initial fluctuation and",
    "the amplitude increases . at state",
    "@xmath76 the maximum amplitude is equal to the bulk value and does not increase anymore . after this state",
    "the grain begins to grow only along the solid liquid phase boundary .",
    "these computations indicate that the subcritical and supercritical grains around the critical nucleus are different to ideal bulk crystals .",
    "in addition to the non - spherical shape of the nucleus , which is not considered in classical nucleation theory , such size dependent properties are also not considered in full detail in classical phase field approaches for nucleation .",
    "a phase - field - crystal model is used to determine nucleation barriers and the critical nucleus in homogeneous nucleation .",
    "the results obtained indicate details of the nucleation process which are not considered in classical nucleation theory but also can not be addressed in full detail with classical phase field models .",
    "the obtained size of the critical nucleus , which here consists only of 7 atoms furthermore asks for an atomistic description .",
    "even if only phenomenological values are used in the computation , the described method gives a proof of concept .",
    "the described string method is independent of the parameterization of the underlying evolution model and thus will allow also to be used for specific materials . with the described implementational details of the string method , concerning parallel processing and adaptive concepts we believe the approach to be applicable also in three dimensions .",
