    "the values of the fundamental constants determine the nature of the physical universe , from the size of mountains on earth to the eventual fate of the universe as a whole .",
    "historically we have assumed that these constants are invariant in space and time .",
    "speculation on the possibility of a time variation of the constants was first discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in very rare cases , such as the oklo mine @xcite",
    ", there exists a terrestrial laboratory to test for time varying constants .",
    "it has been known for over thirty years @xcite that damped lyman alpha systems ( dlas ) @xcite offer the opportunity to measure the value of the fundamental constant @xmath0 , the proton to electron mass ratio as the proton to electron mass ratio rather than the inverse to be consistent with the other recent astronomical determinations of @xmath0 discussed here ] , at early times in the universe .",
    "the opportunity stems from the direct dependence of the rotational energy of molecules on @xmath0 and the square root dependency on @xmath0 of the vibrational energy relative to the electronic energy .",
    "each absorption line has a unique shift for a change in @xmath0 that depends on the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the upper and lower energy states . at the time of @xcite , however , the observational capabilities of astronomical spectroscopy and the accuracy of molecular hydrogen laboratory spectroscopy allowed only very crude determinations of @xmath0 at relatively modest look back times .",
    "the high line density of atomic hydrogen lines in dlas and the rarity of dlas with measurable amounts of molecular hydrogen further complicated progress .",
    "@xcite and @xcite made early measurements of @xmath0 at significant look back times and found no change to accuracies of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the spectrum of pks 0528 - 250 at a redshift of 2.811 . at the same time calculations of the expected shifts",
    "were made by @xcite who developed a method of sensitivity constants for each line that will be discussed later in this work .",
    "an additional constraint of @xmath12 was obtained on the same object by @xcite .",
    "an excellent review of studies relevant to a determination of the time history of @xmath0 and other fundamental constants is given in @xcite .",
    "three advances now provide the opportunity to measure @xmath0 at large look back times and at accuracies that are starting to impact other areas of physics such as dark energy and string theory .",
    "the first advance is the construction of large telescopes such as the keck telescopes , the very large telescopes ( vlt ) and now the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) .",
    "a second advance is the installation of stable , high resolution and sensitive spectrometers such as hires @xcite at keck and uves @xcite at the vlt .",
    "the third key advance is the measurement of the wavelengths of the h@xmath13 lyman and werner electronic transitions to accuracies of a few parts in @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in addition @xcite has recalculated the sensitivity constants , taking into account both adiabatic and nonadiabatic perturbations , to provide an invaluable set of wavelengths at the present day value of @xmath0 and wavelength sensitivities to @xmath0 for the evaluation of the astronomical observations .",
    "the most recent efforts to measure @xmath0 at high redshifts have centered on the ultraviolet and visible echelle spectrometer ( uves ) on the vlt .",
    "the spectra of two quasars observed in january of 2002 ( q0347 - 383 ) and january of 2003 ( q0405 - 443 ) contain h@xmath13 absorption lines at redshfits of 3.0249 and 2.5947 .",
    "the first observations of q0347 - 383 were commissioning observations carried out in 1999 and described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this data along with a uves spectrum of q 1232 + 082 to investigate possible changes in @xmath0 .",
    "they found two results , @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the 3@xmath17 level for two different sets of thorium argon wavelength lists . a subsequent analysis by @xcite using just the q0347 - 383 spectra found a result of @xmath18 .",
    "a later reanalysis of the q0347 - 382 data by @xcite produced a limit at a confidence level of @xmath19 of @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite combined the line lists of @xcite and @xcite and found that @xmath21 at the 2@xmath17 level .    the 2002 and 2003 uves vlt observations of q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 @xcite had higher signal to noise than the 1999 observations .",
    "using new laser determined h@xmath13 wavelengths from @xcite and the uves pipeline reduction of the spectra they found @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite subsequently utilized a new set of laser determined h@xmath13 wavelengths and the pipeline data to find a change in @xmath0 of @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite details the determination of the h@xmath13 parameters and gives a more complete list of laser determined wavelengths that slightly alters the result to @xmath24 .",
    "the @xcite h@xmath13 parameters essentially remove the properties of h@xmath13 from the error budget leaving the data reduction and signal to noise of the observed spectrum as the primary error contributors .",
    "the @xcite result for q0347 - 383 was examined by @xcite who concluded that the data were consistent with @xmath25 at the @xmath19 confidence level . @xcite",
    "have taken the same data set as @xcite with the addition of spectra of q0528 - 250 and found a value of @xmath26 for the combined data set . a key element in their analysis is an improved wavelength calibration as described in @xcite .",
    "at this time there are two analyzes of the same data that lead to two different conclusions .",
    "our independent analysis of the same data concludes that there is no evidence for a change in @xmath0 , consistent with the results of @xcite .    for completeness",
    "we consider radio frequency measurements of @xmath0 that are more precise but at significantly lower redshift .",
    "although the wavelength determinations are more precise , transitions in different molecules must be compared to provide information on any change in @xmath0 .",
    "recently @xcite have looked for variations in @xmath0 using the radio emission lines of ammonia and carbon monoxide .",
    "they take advantage of the high sensitivity of the inversion spectrum of ammonia to changes in @xmath0 with @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the redshift of the inversion lines of ammonia , @xmath29 is the redshift of the rotational lines of co and @xmath30 is the cosmological redshift of the galaxy . for the galaxy b0218 + 357 at a redshift of",
    "they find @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite have improved this result to @xmath32 .",
    "this result is at relatively low redshift and it depends on ammonia and carbon monoxide having identical kinetic velocities in the molecular clouds .",
    "this is probably unlikely since , unlike the ubiquitous co molecule , nh@xmath33 is concentrated in the colder denser cores of molecular clouds .",
    "the fact that it is a null result , however , adds credence to the result since an offset in kinetic velocity would have to accurately match any change in @xmath0 to produce a null result .",
    "the result is also for a relatively low redshift , placing it within the current dark energy dominated epoch of the universe .",
    "some dark energy theories predict that the fundamental constants only roll during the matter dominated epoch and freeze out at their present values once dark energy becomes dominant around a redshift of 1 , ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) . table  [ tab - comp ] provides a summary of the astronomical determinations of @xmath0 .    in our own galaxy @xcite",
    "have reported variations in @xmath0 based on the same ammonia transition along different lines of sight . in this case",
    "the variation is relative to the ccs molecule and is manifested by a general positive velocity offset between the ammonia and ccs emission lines .",
    "their result gives @xmath34 .",
    "slight errors in the line frequencies could mimic such a result .",
    "laboratory experiments have set limits on the present day rate of change of @xmath0 .",
    "even though their time base is brief by cosmological standards , their wavelength accuracy is far better than can be achieved in astronomical observations .",
    "the current best laboratory limits appear to be the results of @xcite which give a result of @xmath35 . to put this in perspective",
    "if the rate of change is constant at @xmath36 then the change at the 11 gigayear look back time of q0347 - 383 would be @xmath37 , similar to the astronomical results given in this work .",
    "there is no real expectation that the rate of change would be constant so both the astronomical and laboratory results work in concert to constrain possible physical models that predict changes in time of the values of the fundamental constants .",
    "the results of @xcite depend on the schmidt model for the nuclear magnetic moment and therefore may be deemed as model dependent .",
    "a laboratory result that is independent of the schmidt model is given by @xcite who give @xmath38 .",
    "other limits on the present rate of variation in @xmath0 based on the weak equivalence principle and various theories of particle physics are discussed by @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper addresses the measurement of @xmath0 in the spectra of q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 .",
    "the wavelength calibration and data reduction to produce the spectra used in this work will only be summarized since it is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "that separate publication is intended to give a full description of the data analysis in order to allow the reader to concentrate on the measurement of @xmath0 described here without a lengthy data reduction description at the beginning . in this paper",
    "we bring those analysis methods to bear in an effort to discriminate between the positive and null results for a variation in @xmath0 .",
    "the observations of q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 with uves on vlt occurred during the nights of january 7 - 9 2002 for q0347 - 383 and january 4 - 6 2003 for q0405 - 443 .",
    "the emission line redshifts for these qsos are 3.22 and 3.02 respectively @xcite .",
    "the data were retrieved from the vlt archive along with the midas based uves pipeline reduction procedures . on each of the nights",
    "three separate spectra of the qso were taken with accompanying long slit calibration lamp integrations at the same grating setting . the slit width and length for both object and calibration line observations are 0.8 and 6.6 arc seconds .",
    "the grating angle for the q0347 - 383 observations had a central wavelength of 4300   and for q0405 - 443 , 3900   .",
    "the images are 2x2 pixel binned on chip with a size of 1024 by 1500 binned pixels .",
    "a single pixel is 15 microns in size and 0.22 arc seconds on the sky . in the following the word pixel",
    "refers to the 2x2 binned pixels ( 0.44 arc seconds ) in the images obtained from the archive . at 4000 ",
    "a pixel is approximately 0.0416   which is about 3 km / sec .",
    "both the calibration and object images are binned identically .",
    "exposure times and other observational parameters are given in tables  [ tab - obs7 ] and [ tab - obs5 ] and are described in @xcite .",
    "there are differences in the way the long slit calibration spectra were taken between the two objects . in the case of q0405 - 443",
    "there was a long slit calibration spectrum taken immediately after the object spectrum in all but one case .",
    "the time tags of the grating position encoder readouts for the object and calibration spectra are identical as are the values of the grating position encoder readings .",
    "this indicates that there was no adjustment of the grating position between the paired object and calibration spectra .",
    "the exception is the night of january 5 , 2003 where there is no long slit calibration spectrum for the second object observation .    for q0347",
    "- 383 two long slit calibration spectra were taken in between the three object spectra for each night .",
    "the encoder readings indicate that there were no grating resets performed between the object spectrum and the calibration spectrum for the first two pairs of object and calibration observations for each night .",
    "the time tags , however , on the third night of january 10 , 2002 pairs the long slit calibration spectrum with the third object spectrum .",
    "the proper pairings of observations are important in calculating the shifts needed to accurately combine the observations as is discussed in   [ ss - wvc ] .",
    "the spectra described by @xcite and used by @xcite were produced by the standard uves pipeline .",
    "the pipeline produces excellent spectra for most observations , however , @xcite points out that the thorium argon line list used in the wavelength calibration may not be accurate enough for the precise determination of fundamental constants .",
    "we reached similar conclusions as discussed in ",
    "[ ss - wvc ] .",
    "the final output of the uves pipeline is an interpolated spectrum with equal wavelength intervals as opposed to an intensity and wavelength on a pixel by pixel basis . in what follows we only use images and spectra on a pixel by pixel basis .",
    "the wavelength calibration and the production of the spectra used in this study are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the descriptions given here are short summaries of the methods .      independently of @xcite",
    "we became aware that the standard th / ar line list used in the uves pipeline analysis provides good wavelengths for most studies but is the primary limiting factor in obtaining the accuracy required for a determination of @xmath0 at the @xmath8 level .",
    "in fact only about 1/4 of the lines are free of blending and other problems .",
    "we then recalibrated the wavelength solutions using the long slit calibration line spectra taken during the observations of the two qsos .",
    "this is described in detail in @xcite which is intended to serve as the record of the wavelength calibration used in this study and therefore will not be repeated here .",
    "the new wavelength calibration is the primary reason for a null result in this study .",
    "it should be noted that this recalibration differs from the recalibration used in @xcite in two ways .",
    "first , this calibration is based on the calibration spectra taken during the observation of the analyzed spectra .",
    "second the calibration is done order by order .",
    "this results in some lines being declared good in one order but unusable in another order where they fall in low signal to noise areas .",
    "the wavelength calibration described in @xcite tracks the shifts in the wavelength positions between observations and between different observing nights .",
    "the final wavelength calibration is relative to a master solution which is set at a single position determined by a master long slit calibration lamp image that is the median of all of the calibration lamp images shifted to the position of the first calibration lamp image .",
    "the shifts are small , a few hundredths of a pixel width , but important in this study .",
    "the shifts are carried out by cubic interpolation and are rigid . the wavelength solution for each order of the master long",
    "slit calibration image is a six term legendre polynomial whose coefficients are different for each order .",
    "the wavelength solution for the object spectra will differ from the master solution first due to small shifts in the actual grating position from the position appropriate to the master solution and due to the motion of the observatory about the barycenter of the earth - sun system .",
    "these are corrected for in the production of the individual spectra .",
    "the order by order final spectrum for each object is a three dimensional array of dimensions [ np , nord,6 ] where np is the number of pixels in the dispersion direction ( 1500 ) , nord is the number of orders and the six last dimensions are flux , wavelength , variance , continuum , fit , and the fit convolved with the instrumental profile for each pixel in the spectrum . in this case",
    "the fit is the continuum minus the best fit to the h@xmath13 lines at their natural line width .",
    "this is what the spectrum would look like if the instrument profile was infinitely narrow .",
    "the first 2 are derived from the object and calibration spectra and calculated for each spectrum .",
    "the last 4 are calculated after the spectra are combined into a single spectrum but could be , in principle , calculated for the individual spectra .",
    "the observational parameters for q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 are listed in tables  [ tab - obs7 ] and [ tab - obs5 ] respectively .      at this stage",
    "there are 9 spectra for each of the 2 objects . in each order of the spectra the flux",
    "is distributed over several pixels in the cross dispersion direction .",
    "we tested several optimal extraction methods for combining the flux in the cross dispersion direction into a single value .",
    "these tests indicated that the uves midas v2.2.0 pipeline extraction did as good or better job of combining the flux than any of the methods we tested .",
    "we therefore used this intermediate product of the pipeline to produce the 9 flux versus pixel spectra for the 2 objects .",
    "these are not the interpolated to constant delta wavelength values spectra that are the final product of the pipeline .",
    "the next step is to assign a proper wavelength designation to each of the pixel positions in each order .",
    "our goal is a proper vacuum wavelength at rest with respect to the barycenter of the earth sun system . again",
    "note that our reference to pixels is to the 2x2 pixel binned output available in the archive .      as mentioned in ",
    "[ ss - wvc ] the true wavelengths of the pixels are slightly different for each spectrum due to small shifts in the spectrometer configuration and different barycentric velocities . the wavelengths are calculated by first shifting the master wavelength solution by the amount calculated from the associated long slit calibration spectrum and then correcting the wavelengths for barycentric velocity .",
    "the associated long slit calibration line observations are given in @xcite .",
    "the wavelength shift due to small differences in the grating position is calculated from the shifts found during the wavelength calibration . as described in ",
    "[ s - obs ] care was taken to not reset the grating position between a long slit calibration observation and its associated object exposures .",
    "for these observations the shift of the object spectrum wavelength position is identical to the shift calculated for the associated calibration line spectrum given in @xcite .",
    "there are , however , two object observations where it appears that the grating position was reset without an associated long slit calibration line exposure .",
    "they are the observations in table  [ tab - obs7 ] for q0347 - 383 that end in 109_b and 981_b .",
    "for these observations our only recourse was to take the shift as the average between the shifts immediately preceding and immediately after the observations .",
    "the correlation between the encoder readouts and the shifts calculated during the wavelength calibration did not appear to be accurate enough to be used as a direct indicator of the amount of shift .",
    "once the shift is determined the master wavelength solution is interpolated to account for the shift in pixel position between the associated calibration line image and the master image .",
    "the wavelengths associated with the flux in the pixels now have the correct observed vacuum wavelength as observed but must still be corrected for the barycentric velocity .",
    "note that the handling of the shift values is different from the description given in @xcite . at that time",
    "is was not known that there was a procedure of reseting the grating position between observations .",
    "it does not affect the master wavelength calibration since the shifts were calculated directly from the calibration observations , but it does matter for the object spectra .",
    "the component along the direction to the object of the barycentric velocity of the observatory was calculated using the date and time of the midpoint of the integration .",
    "this velocity is due to the earth s orbit and rotation relative to the barycenter of the earth - sun system . the wavelength scale was then corrected for this motion so that the final wavelengths are vacuum wavelengths as observed in a reference frame at rest relative to the barycenter .",
    "this is slightly different than the heliocentric wavelengths used in @xcite .      at this point",
    "the individual spectra have the flux , wavelength and noise values populated in their respective arrays .",
    "the wavelengths , however , are slightly different for each spectrum due to the grating shifts and different barycentric velocities .",
    "accurate co - addition of the spectra requires that they all be on the same wavelength scale .",
    "we choose to shift all of the spectra to the wavelength scale of the master wavelength solution for the grating angle setting as described in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum shift was accomplished by interpolation of the flux from the wavelength scale of the spectrum to the master wavelength scale of the master solution using the idl code procedure _ interpol _ in double precision mode . in the following",
    "we will write idl provided procedure names in capital italic letters and procedures written by the authors using idl code in lower case italics .",
    "_ interpol _ uses linear interpolation which is appropriate for this case since the shifts are only a few hundredths of a pixel . for cases with significant fractions of a pixel other interpolation methods",
    "may be more appropriate . at the end of this procedure",
    "all spectra are on a common wavelength scale , the master wavelength solution for each order .",
    "all of the observed spectra for each of the two objects were combined to produce the final two spectra for analysis .",
    "the excellent and uniform observing conditions at the vlt produced a suite of individual spectra with remarkably similar signal to noise characteristics .",
    "in other words the weight of each of the spectra were essentially indistinguishable from each other .",
    "for this reason we simply produced two spectra for each object , one that is the mean of all the flux values at a given wavelength and the second which is the median of the flux values .",
    "again the differences between these two spectra were minimal .",
    "the median spectrum was judged to have slightly better signal to noise in both objects and is the spectrum that is used in the analysis .",
    "the uves pipeline calculates the variance for each of the spectrum fluxes but the documentation is not clear on the exact method of calculation .",
    "the variance is an important quantity in calculating the @xmath39 values for the wavelength and density fits so uncertainty in how it was calculated is worrisome .",
    "the variance is therefore calculated explicitly form the 9 spectra normalized to a common total flux value .",
    "the normalizations varied between 0.8 and 1.2 for the 9 spectra that were combined to make the final spectrum for each object .",
    "the normalization , therefore , does not have a large effect on the calculated variance .",
    "a primary component of this study is the use of accurate molecular data provided by several recent studies of the h@xmath13 molecule ( @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the data from these references include the vacuum wavelengths and calculated sensitivity factors k@xmath40 where the index i indicates the line .",
    "the sensitivity factor to a variation in @xmath0 is different for each line and is defined as    @xmath41    the precise vacuum wavelengths from these references have average errors on the order of @xmath42   which produce a negligible contribution to the errors in determining the redshift of each line .",
    "the oscillator strengths for each transition were calculated using the einstein a coefficients from @xcite for the lyman transitions and @xcite for the werner transitions .",
    "the calculation maintains two primary output products .",
    "the first is a six component spectrum of each order .",
    "the six components are the double precision wavelength , the flux , the standard deviation of the flux , the continuum fit , the line fit and the line fit convolved with the instrument profile .",
    "the second output is an idl structure array which contains the line information .",
    "an idl structure is a multi - format data set that can contain text , integer , floating point and arrays of any of these formats .",
    "there is a structure for each line which contains the molecular data such as oscillator strength and vacuum rest wavelength as well as the calculated data from the fit such as redshift and density .",
    "information on whether the fit for the line converged is also in the structure .",
    "the purpose of this analysis is to determine as accurately as possible the true vacuum wavelength of the observed h@xmath13 absorption lines in the spectra of q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 produced by the procedures discussed in ",
    "[ s - dr ] and @xcite .",
    "these wavelengths are then used in   [ s - dm ] to measure the value of @xmath0 at the epoch represented by the redshift of the dla absorption line system .",
    "the procedures described in the following are procedures written in idl .",
    "our definition of the continuum in this section is not the true continuum of the quasar spectrum but rather the true spectrum without the h@xmath13 absorption lines .",
    "this is the canvas that the h@xmath13 spectrum is painted on . in an analogy to preparing a canvas by sizing it we refer to this as sizing the continuum .",
    "the procedure starts with a first guess of the column densities of the first 5 rotational levels of the h@xmath13 electronic and vibrational ground state and calculates the expected line width , defined as all regions less than @xmath43 of the continuum , using a voigt function , the oscillator strength of the transition , a temperature of 350k and the redshift of the h@xmath13 absorption line system .",
    "the kinetic temperature of 350k is equivalent to doppler parameter of 1.7 km s@xmath44 .",
    "initially the redshift was taken from previous studies but subsequent iterations used the best redshift from the previous iteration .",
    "there is only one velocity component for q0347 - 383 and only the strongest component of the two velocity components in q0405 - 443 was used .",
    "the natural line shape is convolved with the uves instrumental profile to produce the observed line profile .",
    "this procedure simply defines the spectral region that must the replaced with the continuum estimate .",
    "the spectral region inside the line width is then replaced with the expected continuum calculated by interpolating the spectrum on either side of the line which has undergone a 5 pixel smoothing .",
    "it is important to note that as mentioned at the beginning of the section this is a local continuum fit which represents what the spectrum would be if there were no molecular hydrogen lines , not the true continuum flux .",
    "since the fit is local there is an independent continuum fit for each line .",
    "the typical line spans two to three pixels .",
    "the automated continuum calculation gives a rough , first order fit to the sized continuum . at this point a hard copy plot of the spectrum and continuum is produced and examined .",
    "the continuum fit of the selected lines is then interactively refined in an idl based procedure that displays the fit for each line and allows the user to adjust the fit interactively .",
    "the complex spectrum of the lyman alpha forest insures that most of the continuum fits must be adjusted . since the goal of this study is the most precise possible wavelength fit , rather than a column density fit ,",
    "the continuum is usually adjusted preferentially to lower values that emphasize the line center as opposed to the lower signal to noise wings of the line .",
    "tests with various continuum fits indicated that adjustment of the continuum to higher levels produced significant errors in wavelength for some lines but that adjustment to a reasonable range lower levels did not produce wavelength changes larger than the wavelength errors determined in   [ sss - chi ] .",
    "apparently the larger number of pixels in the high continuum cases allowed noise in the wings of the line to have a greater influence on the fit than with the low continuum case .",
    "the line shape convolved with the instrumental profile is about twice as wide as the natural line shape for unsaturated lines .",
    "a mosaic of the spectral regions of all of the lines used in the analysis along with the continuum and line fits are shown in figures  [ fig - m4 ] and [ fig - m3 ] .",
    "these spectra are displayed to allow the reader to judge the quality of the continuum and line fits .",
    "the spectra at this point are ready for the @xmath1 determination .",
    "most of the h@xmath13 lines are unusable due to the lyman alpha forest .",
    "appropriate lines are picked at this time based on freedom from interference by other lines and signal to noise .",
    "a basic selection rule is lines that have greater than @xmath45 asymmetry between the height of their short wavelength and long wavelength shoulders are rejected .",
    "this limits the number of lines used that lie on the shoulders of other lines .",
    "lines that have asymmetric profiles , indicating a blend of two lines , are also rejected .",
    "lines that have profiles broader by @xmath45 than expected from a single line are similarly rejected .",
    "finally lines that do not converge to a stable redshift value in the following analysis are not used to determine the @xmath0 value . during the course of the analysis slightly different selection rules",
    "were applied .",
    "more lenient rules led to larger errors as did more stringent rules that reduced the number of lines in the analysis . in no case , however , did the results exceed a 2@xmath17 excursion from a null result .",
    "the lists of lines used in this analysis are given in tables  [ tab - d47 ] and  [ tab - d45 ] .",
    "these line lists do not directly correspond to the lines used by @xcite who did not publish their selection criteria but were guided by lines selected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite do not list the lines that they used but the text indicates that they were not the same as those use by @xcite .",
    "they did , however , conduct an analysis using the same lines as @xcite and obtained a result of @xmath46 . as in the analysis of @xcite only the stronger of the double system of h@xmath13 lines in q0405 - 443 were used .",
    "the two systems are separated by 13 km / sec which is a separation of roughly 4 of the double binned pixels .      the line fitting procedures are idl based double precision procedures written and developed by authors .",
    "each line is fit individually rather than calculating a complete synthetic spectrum for several reasons .",
    "the first is that most of the large number of molecular hydrogen lines are unusable due to blends with other lines or due to complete obliteration by the lyman @xmath47 forest .",
    "they would simply contribute noise to the fit .",
    "second we are looking for shifts away from the expected wavelengths that a global fit would wash out .",
    "finally we allow the column density to be an independent parameter for each line and use anomalous densities to find lines that are blended with other lines .",
    "the individual selected h@xmath13 lines are fit iteratively with alternate adjustments of the wavelength and the column density .",
    "the fit function is a voigt function calculated with the idl function _",
    "voigt _ that is convolved with the instrument profile .",
    "the idl _ voigt _",
    "function is calculated with double precision parameters and returns a double precision result .",
    "the instrument profile is represented by a gaussian of halfwidth 0.037014   at 3900   digitized in units of 0.001   @xcite .",
    "the halfwidth is adjusted at other wavelengths to be directly proportional to the wavelength .",
    "changes in the width of the gaussian by plus or minus @xmath48 changed the derived column density but had no effect on the derived wavelength within the wavelength errors attributable to signal to noise .",
    "the kinetic and excitation temperature of the gas is not varied but held at 350k for both objects for the initial fitting . during the iteration of the fits we did not require all lines with the same lower state to have the same column density",
    "this is similar to letting the excitation temperature vary from line to line .",
    "the kinetic temperature is held fixed at 350k .",
    "changes in the kinetic temperature by @xmath49 k did not alter the derived wavelengths within the @xmath50 bounds .",
    "the fit is started with an initial guess at the column density for each ground state rotational level and an initial guess at the redshift .",
    "after a few runs these initial guesses were refined to produce a better starting solution .",
    "the fit procedure starts with the wavelength adjustment followed by a column density adjustment .",
    "this procedure is iterated 6 times .",
    "lines that have not converged after six iterations are then rerun with another 6 tries at convergence .",
    "any lines that have not converged in both column density and wavelength after the two iterations are not used in the analysis .",
    "convergence is declared when two tries in sequence return the same column density and wavelength values .",
    "the first of the 6 tries in each iteration starts with a sweep of the wavelength in 200 @xmath8   steps on either side of the starting wavelength .",
    "the starting wavelength is either the wavelength from the initial guess at the redshift for the first iteration or the best wavelength from the previous try in the second and subsequent iterations . at each of the 200 wavelengths on either side of the initial wavelength",
    "the line fit is calculated as a voigt function superimposed upon the continuum spectrum as discussed in   [ ss - cont ] and   [ s - fl ] .",
    "the calculated spectrum is then convolved with the instrument profile as described in   [ s - fl ] . a @xmath39 value for the difference between the fit and the observed flux is then calculated for all spectral points in the line that are deeper than @xmath19 of the continuum . after the sweep over the 400 wavelength positions the best wavelength is taken to be the wavelength with the minimum @xmath39 value .",
    "if the best wavelength is not at either extremum of the wavelength sweep the number of test wavelengths is reduced by a percentage that is proportional to the distance of the best wavelength from the extremum .",
    "the minimum number of test wavelengths is 10 .",
    "subsequent tries at the wavelength fit are all centered at the best wavelength from the previous try .",
    "after each try at the wavelength fit there is an adjustment of the column density .",
    "the wavelength is fixed at the best wavelength from the last wavelength iteration .",
    "the column density is varied over 200 values ranging from @xmath51 of the initial density to twice the initial density in @xmath51 increments .",
    "the initial column density is either the initial guess column density or the density found in previous column density iteration .",
    "a @xmath39 value is then calculated for all column density points in the same way as the wavelength iteration .",
    "the best column density is taken as the density with the minimum @xmath39 value .",
    "although the column density range is asymmetric between the high and low ends it usually converges in the first 2 to 3 iterations .",
    "mosaic plots of the @xmath39 values calculated for each line are shown in figures  [ fig - c4 ] and [ fig - c3 ] .",
    "the values are shown for 100 wavelengths on either side of the best wavelength .",
    "the wavelength values are spaced by @xmath52   rather than the @xmath8   spacing in the actual analysis .",
    "note that the @xmath39 values are smoothly varying in a semi - parabolic shape with a definite minimum .",
    "@xcite point out that this is a necessary criterion for valid @xmath39 values .",
    "although the values are generally symmetric about the minimum there is significant asymmetry in some of the plots .",
    "this is expected from line profiles that are also not symmetric",
    ". only the wavelength , which is the primary parameter of interest , is varied in the plots , as opposed to both the wavelength and the column density in the fitting procedure , so that the minimum @xmath39 value is for one degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath39 values range from values almost as low as 1.1 to values as high as 45.6 , with q0347 - 383 having in general lower @xmath39 values than q0405 - 443 which has a lower signal to noise spectrum . there",
    "does not appear to be any correlation between the individual @xmath39 values and the deviation of the reduced redshift from the average reduced redshift for each object .",
    "the lines with the highest deviation from the average reduced redshift are not the ones with the highest @xmath39 values .",
    "the error bars for each line in figures [ fig - a ] and [ fig - b ] are calculated by running the line fit calculations on either side of the minimum @xmath39 wavelength until the @xmath39 value increases by unity over the minimum @xmath39 value .",
    "this produces in some cases a significant difference between the positive and negative error bars .",
    "the positive and negative errors along with the @xmath39 values for the individual line fits are listed in tables  [ tab - d47 ] and [ tab - d45 ] .",
    "tables  [ tab - d47 ] and [ tab - d45 ] give the results of the line fitting for q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 respectively . note that some transitions are repeated since they appear in two different orders .",
    "in our analysis we treat these as independent measures .",
    "figures  [ fig - a ] and [ fig - b ] are the plots of reduced redshift @xmath53 versus sensitivity factor k@xmath40 for q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 in manner similar to that first used by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite both display their results with similar plots .",
    "the reduced redshift @xmath53 is defined by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the true redshift of the system taken as the median redshift of all of the lines , @xmath56 is the redshift of individual lines and @xmath57 is defined in equation  [ eq - k ] .",
    "the median redshifts of the h@xmath13 absorptions in q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 are 3.0248996 and 2.5947366 respectively , relative to the earth - sun barycenter .",
    "the slope in this plot is the value of @xmath58 .",
    "the thick black dash dot and dash triple dot lines in the figures are the weighted and unweighted linear least squares fits to the combined data for all rotational levels for each object where the weights are determined by the standard deviations of the individual data points .",
    "the colored light solid and dotted lines are the fits to only lines with the same rotational level ground states given by the color codes in the caption .",
    "the weighted and unweighted fits to q0347 - 383 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the weighted and unweighted fits for q0405 - 443 are @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for the combined data set shown in figure  [ fig - cd ] the weighted fit yields @xmath63 and the unweighted fit gives @xmath64 .",
    "both of these results are consistent with no variation in @xmath0 at the @xmath65 confidence level .",
    "our result is consistent with the findings of @xcite giving @xmath66 and @xcite which give @xmath26 .",
    "they are inconsistent at a roughly @xmath67 level with that of @xcite and @xcite who found @xmath68 .",
    "the stated errors between the three measurement vary widely .",
    "it should be noted that the error quoted by @xcite is a @xmath69 error so the value @xmath70 should be used in comparison to the other two measurements . @xcite",
    "perform an analysis where they use the same lines as @xcite and their error grows to about @xmath71 for the individual objects .",
    "this error is similar but slightly smaller than our errors .",
    "@xcite also include a third object q0528 - 250 which has a significantly smaller quoted error than the two objects common to all of the studies",
    ". in the weighted mean of errors q0528 - 250 has a dominant effect on the quoted error . in the following we discuss our error analysis .",
    "the least squares linear fit to the weighted combined data of 77 lines gives a @xmath39 value of 104.9 .",
    "assuming n-2 degrees of freedom this is a @xmath39 value of 1.4 per degree of freedom . in the combined data",
    "there are 10 pairs of lines of the same transition but observed in a different orders .",
    "q0347 - 383 has 4 pairs and q0405 - 443 has 6 pairs .",
    "we have treated these as independent measurements since they have independent photon noise and read noise statistics .",
    "systematic effects such as unknown blended lines and continuum shape may introduce systematics into the measurements .",
    "individual inspection of the line pairs indicates that the dispersion in reduced redshift between the two measurements is consistent with the dispersion between independent lines and should not bias the results .",
    "as an alternative check on the statistical significance of the null result we performed a bootstrap analysis on the combined data set .",
    "we produced 10,000 new data sets by drawing the same number of lines but randomly selected allowing duplication from the original data set .",
    "linear least square fits were performed on the data sets and the result plotted as a histogram shown in figure  [ fig - bs ] .",
    "the smooth curve in the figure is a gaussian fit to the histogram .",
    "the peak of the gaussian is at a @xmath1 value of @xmath72 and the half width at half maximum is @xmath73 , both of which are consistent with the results of the @xmath39 analysis .",
    "the histogram values conform to the gaussian fit quite well indicating the appropriateness of the assumption of gaussian distributed errors .",
    "since transitions from 4 different rotational levels ( j=0,1,2,3 ) are used it is possible that the transitions could arise from physically offset regions of the molecular cloud that could also have velocity offsets .",
    "our null result is less prone to this type of error , however , velocity offsets could be in a direction to reduce a @xmath1 signal . to check for this the solutions for lines with the same rotational ground level and the same object",
    "are plotted in figures  [ fig - a ] and [ fig - b ] . in q0347 - 383",
    "there is only one line with a ground rotational level of 0 so no solution is plotted for it .",
    "the j=1 and 3 solutions have roughly the same slope while the j=2 solution has a different slope with the opposite sign .",
    "this would appear difficult to achieve with physical velocity offsets which would be presumed to have a smooth gradient of velocity with temperature . in q0405 - 443",
    "there are no j=0 lines and only one j=1 line so no solutions exist for those systems .",
    "the j=2 and j=3 slopes are of opposite sign but within the error bars of each other . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely that velocity gradients with excitation level are masking a change in @xmath0 .      to improve the statistics of the sample we have combined the lines from the two systems .",
    "the higher redshift system associated with q0347 - 383 shows a shift in @xmath0 at the @xmath74 level in the unweighted fit and at a @xmath75 level in the weighted fit , both indicating a decrease in the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the system associated with q0405 - 443 at a lower redshift shows an increase in @xmath0 in both the unweighted and weighted fit but at levels significantly less that @xmath74 .",
    "the q0405 - 443 system has 7 more lines than the q0347 - 383 system .",
    "it could be argued that the combination of the two data sets dilutes the signal of a real shift in the q0347 - 383 system at the higher redshift and earlier time in the universe . although we would not claim a real shift in @xmath0 with a @xmath75 result we can not rule out that the combined data set is diluting the evidence for a change in @xmath0 .",
    "the higher than expected value of the @xmath39 per degree of freedom could be due to the difference in fitted slopes of the two systems taken separately .",
    "the method of sensitivity coefficient fitting is subject to systematic errors in the wavelength scale . in general the sensitivity coefficients increase with increasing vibrational energies in the upper level of the transitions .",
    "this means that for a given electronic transition system the sensitivity coefficient increases with decreasing transition wavelength .",
    "that means that any systematic error that produces an erroneous gradient in the wavelength calibration will mimic a change in @xmath0 .",
    "this is mitigated to some degree by the mixture of lyman and werner bands .",
    "the higher electronic energy of the upper level of the werner system places low values of the sensitivity coefficient at the same wavelengths as high sensitivity coefficient lyman transitions . at wavelengths",
    "longer than the longest wavelengths of the werner system , however , there is no mitigating effect",
    ". it may be this effect coupled with the systematic errors in the older uves pipeline reductions found by @xcite that produced the positive detection of a change in @xmath0 by @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite , figures 7 and 8 , indicates that the wavelength calibration used in this analysis is not subject to systematic errors of the magnitude cited in @xcite .",
    "in addition our wavelength calibration is on an order by order basis which resets the solution for each order , making it more difficult to have systematic effects over the whole wavelength solution .",
    "the werner lines with a higher upper electronic level provide lines with low upper state vibrational levels at wavelengths that are close to lyman lines with high upper state vibrational levels . since the sensitivity factors are roughly proportional to upper state vibrational level this mixes lines with low sensitivity factors with those with high factors . under the assumption that any possible systematic wavelength errors are minimized for lines that lie close together",
    "we have looked at the redshift differences between all of the werner lines and the lyman lines that are adjacent to them in the same order .",
    "there are a limited number of line pairs that satisfy this criterion , 8 for q0347 - 383 and 7 for q0405 - 443 .",
    "histograms of the distribution are given in figure  [ fig - wl ] .",
    "the distribution of delta redshift values ( z(lyman ) - z(werner ) ) for q0405 - 443 are roughly evenly distributed around zero but the delta redshift values for q0347 - 383 are all negative .",
    "this is consistent with the negative slope of the fit in figure  [ fig - a ] .",
    "the analysis results for q0347 - 383 show a negative shift in the value of @xmath0 at the 1.75 @xmath17 level which has a statistical probability of being a true shift at the 91@xmath76 percent level if the errors are gaussian distributed .",
    "this is certainly not a level which justifies declaring a change in a fundamental constant but raises the marginal possibility that there might be a change .",
    "in addition the comparison between the werner and lyman lines in figure  [ fig - wl ] shows a negative delta between the werner and lyman lines for a seven cases which has a probability of @xmath77 chance of happening randomly .",
    "if a monotonically rolling scalar field is invoked for the change , the higher redshift of q0347 - 383 could be why a change is seen in q0347 - 383 and not q0405 - 443 .",
    "we consider this evidence as suggestive but in no way conclusive .",
    "it does point out the need for observations of systems at higher redshift .",
    "our basic conclusion , based on the combination of data from q0347 - 383 and q0405 - 443 , is that there has been no change in the value of @xmath0 to 1 part in @xmath78 over a time span of 11.5 gigayears .",
    "this is approximately @xmath9 of the age of the universe .",
    "the accuracy of the limit on @xmath1 is set by both the spectral resolution and the signal to noise ratio of the flux .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results of @xcite but inconsistent with the results of @xcite . starting with the same raw data ,",
    "the primary difference in this analysis is the use of improved wavelength calibration techniques that eliminated the systematic variations in the calibration used in the uves pipeline at the time of the @xcite analysis .",
    "the line selection is also most likely different from @xcite but without a list of those lines it is difficult to assess the influence of the lines chosen .",
    "there is a marginal possibility of the detection of a change in @xmath0 based on the q0347 - 383 data alone .",
    "we , however , feel that this result while suggestive is certainly not conclusive .",
    "what implications does a limit on @xmath1 of @xmath8 have on theories of dark energy that invoke a rolling scalar field potential as the source of the dark energy ?",
    "@xcite have despaired about distinguishing between a universe with a cosmological constant relative to a universe with a quintessence rolling scalar field , however , the former predicts no change in @xmath0 while the latter predicts a change even though the magnitude or even the sign of the change is not presently calculable .",
    "detection of a change in @xmath0 or its companion the fine structure constant @xmath47 would be strong evidence for quintessence as opposed to a cosmological constant .        where @xmath82 is @xmath83",
    ", @xmath84 is the planck mass and @xmath85 is a parameter of unknown value ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "determination of the value of @xmath0 at high redshift is therefore a direct way to distinguish between quintessence and a cosmological constant . in grand unified theories ( guts ) the rolling of @xmath0",
    "is typically given by      where @xmath87 is the qcd scale , @xmath88 is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , r is a model dependent value ( @xcite and references therein ) and @xmath47 is the fine structure constant . in many gut models",
    "the value of r is large and negative @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "our current results limit the value of @xmath90 in equation  [ eq - dm ] to be on the order of @xmath8 or less , but does not tell us the individual values of @xmath91 or @xmath85 .",
    "the results do , however , rule out model a of @xcite at about the 4@xmath17 level where the potential is given by      which predicts a value of @xmath93 at a redshift of 3 .",
    "this means that even at the current level of accuracy significant bounds on the quintessence models are being established . in all fairness to the model it must be pointed out that it was designed to achieve that result to match the findings of @xcite .",
    "if the claim of a detected change in the fine structure constant @xmath47 ( @xmath94 @xcite ) is accepted then this implies a value of r of @xmath95 which is significantly different in sign and magnitude that the typical gut value quoted above .",
    "this would mean that either the roll of both the qcd scale and the higgs vev is small or that they are equal to each other by less than a factor of 2 .",
    "of course if the claim for a change in @xmath47 is not accepted the current limitation on @xmath96 places no limit on r.    rit would like to acknowledge interesting and useful conversations with wim ubachs , dimitrios psaltis , feryal ozel and michael murphy on theory and technique .",
