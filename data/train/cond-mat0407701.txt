    ", a sizeable effect will only arise when the two conductors are very close to each other .",
    "this condition can be met in mesoscopic systems  where with the advent of new technologies ( e.g. , carbon nanotubes ) the problem of coulomb drag attracted more and more attention ( e.g. , refs.)or in the spin - drag problem . for instead of considering two conductors",
    "one may look at drag effects between different fermion species , e.g. , fermions with different spin orientation .",
    "since fermions with different spins are not spatially separated , there is a large coulomb force between them which can lead to all kinds of correlation effects , e.g. , a drag effect . in the last years",
    ", the interest in spin - dependent transport increased .",
    "one key problem is the generation of a spin - polarized current , i.e. , a current where only fermions with one of the two spin orientations flow . in this context",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the spin - polarized current may affect the fermions with the opposite spin orientation .",
    "hence , the drag effect may play here a crucial rle even though it is experimentally not directly accessible .",
    "( this is because the driving potentials are in general not spin dependent . )    for this `` spin - drag '' problem the trans - resistivity of higher dimensional systems has been investigated in previous publications , e.g. , using the boltzmann equation@xcite or the random - phase approximation.@xcite in this paper we focus on the transconductance for the hubbard model .",
    "while most authors used a bosonization approach to compute the conductance@xcite we will use here , for the study of the transconductance , a monte carlo method which we introduced in a recent paper.@xcite the strategy we followed there was to map our fermion system via the jordan - wigner transformation to a spin system which can be analyzed by efficient though standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "we will now extend this method to the one - dimensional hubbard model concentrating on the question how a spin - polarized current ( driven by a voltage drop which is assumed to be spin dependent ) affects the fermions with opposite spin orientation .    in the section [ sec_def ] we present the model and give some central definitions for the spin - drag problem .",
    "the sec .",
    "[ mocar ] contains the technical details on the subject of the mc simulations .",
    "the mc method of our choice@xcite was a variant of the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) as introduced in refs .  .",
    "this method allows an investigation of the one - dimensional hubbard model .",
    "@xcite    in the following sec .",
    "[ sec_num_hubb ] we present our results for the standard hubbard model and compare with analytical predictions from bosonization theory . to obtain a spin - polarized current we add in sec .",
    "[ sec_imp ] an impurity to the system , which acts like a combination of a one - site chemical potential and a one - site magnetic field .",
    "we show that such a `` magnetic '' impurity can produce the desired spin - polarized current .",
    "the hubbard model can also be mapped to a spinless - fermion ladder .",
    "hence , our results may also describe that situation , but there one might argue that the very specific modeling of the coulomb ( on - site ) interaction in the hubbard model is unrealistic ( and may differ from other approaches , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "we therefore discuss two variants ( with additional interaction terms ) of our model .",
    "first , we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec_zig_zag ] a situation , where fermions with different spins live on different sites .",
    "the full system has the geometry of a zig - zag chain .",
    "second , we show in the appendix that a spin - polarized interaction leads to equal cis- and transconductance .",
    "this is similar to the `` absolute '' drag result found , e.g. , in ref .  .",
    "our model hamiltonian is the standard hubbard model ( with @xmath0 sites or atoms ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the occupation number of fermions with spin @xmath3 at site @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the corresponding annihilation ( creation ) operator . to perform our transport calculations , we will use the approach from ref .   .",
    "since the hopping term does not connect fermions with different spins , it is natural to consider current and potential operators for each spin orientation separately .",
    "following ref .",
    "the potential operators read then : ( @xmath6 being the charge unit and @xmath7 being the position of the voltage drop ) @xmath8 the conductance ( of a spinless - fermion chain ) is the linear response of one potential operator to another ; therefore the explicit form of the current operators is not needed here.@xcite as we have two potentials , we can define four transport quantities ( conductances ) @xmath9 which describe the ( linear ) response of @xmath10 to @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "further details on how to evaluate the @xmath9 s are to be found in section [ mocar ] .    for the moment we will discuss only symmetric models , i.e. , we have spin - rotational invariance ( the only asymmetric model that we will discuss appears in sec .  [ sec_imp ] ) ; thus , we end up with only two distinct quantities .",
    "we call @xmath13 the _ cisconductance _ and @xmath14 the _ transconductance_.    the naming conventions come from the physical interpretation of these coefficients which is the following : if we switch on at a certain time a ( supposedly ) spin - polarized potential which acts only on spin - up fermions ( i.e. , we add a time - dependent perturbation of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the voltage amplitude and @xmath17 the heavyside - step function ) we will find a current of spin - up fermions @xmath18 this is the _ drive _ current governed by the cisconductance , but there will also be a current of spin - down fermions @xmath19 the _ drag _ current ( governed by the transconductance ) . the latter may be nonzero , even though the spin - down fermions do not feel the applied potential .    the situation of a nonvanishing transconductance ( or drag current ) is called _ coulomb drag_. this problem has been studied , e.g. , for coupled spinless - fermion systems by bosonization in refs .   and to second - order perturbation",
    "theory in ref .  .",
    "normally , ( since spin - polarized potentials are not available ) one is only interested in the ( full ) conductance of the hubbard model , where both fermion species feel the same potential , and the full current is the sum of the currents of the spin - up and spin - down fermions . as is straightforward to see ,",
    "the cis- and transconductance give us directly the conductance of the hubbard model via the relation @xmath20 .",
    "before starting with monte carlo we have to cast our hamiltonian in a convenient form .    using the jordan - wigner transform the hubbard model can be mapped to a spin ladder . to each occupation operator",
    "we introduce a spin operator , i.e. , we replace @xmath21 and @xmath22 . if we express the hubbard hamiltonian with those new operators we obtain the following spin ladder ( with @xmath23 sites ) :    @xmath24 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_n \\left[us_{2n}^zs_{2n+1}^z+u^\\prime s_{2n+1}^zs_{2n+2}^z\\right ] , \\label{hamillad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the sites with even number represent spin - up fermions and the sites with odd numbers , spin - down fermions .",

    "[ hsplit ] .",
    "the sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the ladder represent therefore one atom of the hubbard model and interact via an ising interaction representing the coulomb force ( see fig .",

    "half filling corresponds therefore to @xmath31 .",
    "the two potential operators @xmath32 introduced in the previous section can be related to potential operators for the two chains ( @xmath6 being the charge unit ) @xmath33 then we may obtain the four conductances @xmath9 introduced in the previous section by computing ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 at the matsubara frequencies @xmath36 , and then extrapolating to @xmath37 .",
    "( the extrapolated value should not depend on @xmath7 or @xmath38.@xcite we chose @xmath39 . ) for the extrapolation from @xmath40 to @xmath41 we will use a quadratic fit from the first three matsubara frequencies . [",
    "we will use open ( obc s ) instead of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc s ) . ]    since the hamiltonian contains heisenberg - like interactions as well as ising - like interactions , it is advantageous to use the stochastic cluster series expansion ( scse ) introduced in ref .. for the hubbard model the scse gives essentially the same update scheme as the one used in ref .. we will explain it now shortly .",
    "following ref .",
    "we split the hamiltonian according to @xmath42 , but this time into four - sites clusters , called plaquettes ( see fig .  [ hsplit ] ) .",
    "the following operators belong to the plaquette @xmath43 ( containing interactions between the sites @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 the set @xmath47 consists of all @xmath48 for all plaquettes @xmath43 and all @xmath49 .",
    "the heart of the scse program is the so called loop update , where a spin flip of a subset ( loop ) of all spin variables is proposed .",
    "since the sites with even and odd numbers form two chains , which are only coupled by a @xmath50-@xmath50 interaction term , we find that the set of spin variables that will be flipped in the loop update belongs entirely to one of the chains .",
    "therefore , we can view the new algorithm as _ making loop updates for each chain separately_. during a loop update for one chain the spin variables of the other chain remain fixed .",
    "the consequence of this is that , if we update , e.g. , the even chain , then operators with superscript @xmath51 can be neglected ( are irrelevant for the loop construction ) , and the coupling terms ( between the chains ) reduce to magnetic field terms ( for the even chain ) .",
    "it is however advantageous to consider another variant of the loop update .",
    "the construction is similar to the first variant , but now we propose spin flips for both chains , i.e. , the spin variables belonging to sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 are flipped simultaneously .",
    "this may be viewed as a construction of two parallel loops ",
    "one for each chain .",
    "since the two loops must be parallel , the number of possible transitions between different plaquette states is reduced .",
    "this may lead to a less efficient algorithm,@xcite but one should note that this parallel - loop update becomes deterministic for the case of @xmath31 and hence enhances the efficiency of the algorithm ( at least for this situation ) considerably .",
    "in bosonization theory the hubbard model is described by two boson fields @xmath52 representing the degrees of freedom of different spin orientations .",
    "the current operators for the spin sectors are then given by @xmath53.@xcite the conductance can be written in the form of a current - current correlator@xcite and may be evaluated in terms of the luttinger - liquid parameters @xmath54 of the charge and spin field@xcite @xmath55 . the result is ( using the linearity of the correlator and the results from ref .  ) @xmath56    when @xmath57 we are at half filling , where umklapp processes are responsible for a gap in the system.@xcite the ( charge ) gap @xmath58 depends on the hubbard repulsion @xmath59 and is finite for all @xmath59 .",
    "we present now monte carlo results for the transconductance in the hubbard model eq.([hhubb ] ) [ or eq .",
    "( [ hamillad ] ) for @xmath60 .",
    "we performed simulations for two different chemical potentials : first , @xmath57 corresponding to half filling and second @xmath61 . in the latter case",
    "the system is no longer at half filling , but has a @xmath59-dependent filling , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ stgmu ] of the appendix ( in the large-@xmath59 limit the system reaches quarter filling ) .",
    "we show @xmath62 and @xmath63 as a function of @xmath59 for the two different @xmath64 s in fig .",
    "[ hullz1a ] .",
    "the figure shows that the coulomb drag is very sensitive to a change in chemical potential .",
    "let us first look at the _ half - filled _ case ( fig .",
    "[ hullz1a ] ) .",
    "if @xmath59 is very large the coulomb repulsion acts as an effective projection to those configurations satisfying @xmath65 .",
    "this implies that @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "this contemplation is in accordance with fig .",
    "[ hullz1a ] .",
    "we should actually expect from eq .",
    "( [ krs ] ) that for @xmath68 we have @xmath69 because of the charge gap @xmath70 for all @xmath71 ( cf .  ref .  ) .",
    "this should lead to a discontinuous jump at @xmath72 , because without the coulomb force evidently @xmath73 and @xmath62 is the conductance of uncoupled spinless - fermion chains from ref .  .",
    "here we emphasize that our method is a finite - temperature method , which means that the conductances calculated by us interpolate smoothly between the values for @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "the crossover is expected to take place at that interaction value @xmath75 which satisfies @xmath76 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see how @xmath77 scale with temperature .",
    "however , our method gives only access to the low-@xmath78 regime,@xcite such that we will compare here results for only two different temperatures , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "in the two subsequent simulations for the cis-/transconductance we did not find any difference at all .",
    "this implies only a weak temperature dependence ( at low @xmath78 ) for the interaction @xmath75 which governs the crossover .",
    "since @xmath58 is known from analytical results,@xcite we can calculate the two crossover interactions  defined by @xmath81 and @xmath82finding that @xmath83 and @xmath84 do not differ much , as expected ( they are also both indicated by arrows in fig.[hullz1a ] ) .",
    "another important consequence of @xmath66 is that the signs of the cis- and transconductance are opposite or  in terms of the spin - up and spin - down currents  that the induced drag current flows in the opposite direction of the drive current.@xcite    now we will turn to the spin sector .",
    "we have @xmath85 by spin - rotational invariance of the hubbard model@xcite implying [ see eq .",
    "( [ krs ] ) ] @xmath86 for all @xmath59 which is very well satisfied by fig .",
    "[ hullz1a ] .",
    "putting the two results for @xmath87 together , we obtain @xmath88 valid at high @xmath59 .",
    "this large-@xmath59 limit of @xmath62 may also be computed in second - order perturbation theory . in this approximation",
    "the hubbard model can be mapped to a heisenberg model . the operator [ on the hilbert space of the original hamiltonian eq .",

    "[ mocar ] . ] applying the results from ref .",
    "the computation of @xmath62 reduces then to the computation of the spin conductance of the heisenberg model , which equals one half in units @xmath93 .    in the case of _",
    "zero _ @xmath64 ( again fig .",
    "[ hullz1a ] ) where the system is away from half filling there is no charge gap .",
    "hence , @xmath94 is finite , and so eq .  ( [ krs ] )",
    "tells us that @xmath95 does not decay with @xmath59 .",
    "[ here we note that @xmath96 agrees ( within error bars ) with the values for @xmath97 available in ref .. ] we still have @xmath85 , which leads to @xmath86 for all @xmath59 ( again very well satisfied by the figure ) .",
    "finally , we consider the large-@xmath59 limit . inserting @xmath98 and @xmath99 from ref .   in eq .",
    "( [ krs ] ) yields @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( units @xmath93 ) .",

    "the modeling of the impurity follows ref .  ,",
    "but for the spin - drag problem it is natural to consider a spin - dependent impurity , as we will do here .",
    "we extend therefore our hamiltonian in the following way @xmath103 i.e. , we introduce an ( impurity ) potential at exactly one central site ( which acts only on one spin orientation , see fig .  [ hsplitb ] ) .",
    "[ hull1kf ] shows cisconductances and transconductances as a function of the impurity potential @xmath104 at _ half filling_. ( the example is chosen such that the transconductance in the unperturbed system is relatively large . )",
    "the conductance of the heisenberg chain with one impurity , which is the large-@xmath59 limit of @xmath62 , is given for comparison .",
    "although the two cisconductances , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , could in principle differ ( the model is now asymmetric ) they do not in the case of half filling  at least within error bars . both cisconductance and transconductance go  more or less linearly  to zero as the impurity strength increases .",
    "we note that within error bars @xmath107 such that the full conductance of the system @xmath108 remains zero after insertion of the impurity .",
    "furthermore , investigations with our method at different temperatures find no sizeable @xmath78-dependence .    in the case of _",
    "zero chemical potential , @xmath61 , _ we find a splitting of the two cisconductances ( see fig .  [ hull2bkf ] ) .",
    "this is particularly interesting since this finding implies a spin - polarized current .",
    "if we assume a ( spin - independent ) driving potential of the form @xmath109 ( @xmath16 being the voltage amplitude ) , then the current is @xmath110 the average spin of a fermion in the current is therefore ( using @xmath111 ) @xmath112 different from zero ( see fig .",
    "[ spinpol ] ) .",
    "an interesting problem is the question whether for @xmath61 the cisconductance in the pure ( spin - down ) sector @xmath106 survives or not when we increase @xmath113 to infinity .",
    "note that a finite @xmath106 would imply a total spin polarization , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "the limit @xmath115 of @xmath106 can not be taken directly ( because of problems with the mc simulation ) , but here we note that there is another way to model the impurity . instead of applying a local magnetic field on one site , one can introduce a weak link , i.e. , decrease the hopping amplitude for spin - up fermions between the sites @xmath116 and @xmath117 from the initial value @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "these two variants of impurities behave similarly.@xcite we computed the cisconductance for the unaffected spin orientation for the model with @xmath120 ( corresponds to @xmath121 ) at @xmath61 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 sites .",
    "we find a value of about @xmath124 { e^2/h}$ ] .",
    "the different behavior of the cisconductance in the ( unaffected ) spin - down sector at half filling and away from half filling may be explained as follows : suppose @xmath113 and @xmath59 are large .",
    "the effect of the @xmath113 term on the fermions is that it forbids occupation of the impurity site for one of the two fermion species ( in our case spin - up fermions ) . at half filling a spin - up fermion",
    "can hop only from one site to another by exchanging the site with a spin - down fermion ( there are no empty sites ) , i.e. , simultaneously with the spin - up a spin - down fermion must hop in the opposite direction _",
    "et vice versa _ ( implying @xmath107 ) .",
    "a fermion of a certain spin index can then only pass the impurity site if accompanied by a fermion of opposite spin ( which moves in the opposite direction ) .",
    "since the impurity site is forbidden for one of the two fermion species , no fermion can pass the impurity site , and both cisconductances must go to zero .",
    "away from half filling the hopping of an spin - up fermion does not necessarily require the hopping of a spin - down fermion ( the spin - up fermion can hop to an empty site ) and hence the impurity affects only one of the two cisconductances .",
    "so far we have dealt with a system of two fermion species , where the two species reside on the same set of sites . in contrast to this ,",
    "the bosonization approaches considered mostly systems of two coupled spinless - fermion conductors .",
    "we can compare our results with that situation , if we interpret the hubbard model as a spinless - fermion ladder . here",
    "one assumes that each fermion species lives on a different conductor [ i.e. , the two indices ( @xmath125 ) and ( @xmath126 ) are supposed to label ( spatially ) different sites ; compare sec .",
    "[ mocar ] and upper half of fig .",
    "[ hsplit ] ] .",
    "but one should note that for this case the parameter @xmath59 should be small ( since the distance between separated conductors is large ) and the coulomb interaction should be long - ranged ( not on - site as in the hubbard model ) .",
    "hence we are led to the question how a variation in the interaction term modifies our results .    to address this question",
    "we add a new interaction term to the hubbard model @xmath127 this hamiltonian corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ hamillad ] ) with @xmath128 .",
    "one can justify introducing this new interaction term if the fermion species live on different sites where each spin - down site ( @xmath126 ) lies between two spin - up sites , ( @xmath125 ) and ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "this model has therefore the geometry of a frustrated zig - zag chain as depicted in the lower half of fig .",
    "[ hsplit ] .",
    "one should note that this system has a total of @xmath23 sites , @xmath0 sites for each fermion species .",
    "[ although it would be useful to adopt the notion of a system with two coupled ( spinless - fermion ) chains , we will keep here the notation of a system of spinfull fermions . ]    the results for the spin drag in this model are shown in fig .",
    "we discuss again two chemical potentials : one is @xmath130 implying half filling , the other is again @xmath61 . in the latter case",
    "the ( mean ) occupation number per site @xmath131 is different from one half ( the occupation at half filling ) and depends on @xmath59 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ stgmuzz ] .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "[ huls ] that @xmath132 grow with the strength of the interaction .",
    "this may be explained as follows : first , the coulomb interaction mediates an _ attractive _ nearest - neighbor interaction for fermions with equal spin orientation ( this is a consequence of the frustration ) . therefore , in a simple approximation the only effect of the coulomb interaction is to renormalize the luttinger - liquid parameters for the two spin sectors @xmath133 . since the luttinger parameter for a spinless - fermion chain increases with the strength of the attraction,@xcite we expect that @xmath133 increases as @xmath59 increases . since @xmath133 gives the conductance of one spin sector@xcite ( which is essentially the cisconductance ) we have that @xmath62 increases with @xmath59 .",
    "one may also infer from the figure that the dependence of @xmath77 on a chemical - potential shift is weak . within error",
    "bars @xmath62 decreases only slightly upon shifting @xmath64 away from half filling .",
    "one should note that in the limit @xmath74 the ground state is a spin - polarized configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ anfecofig ] ) . for @xmath130",
    "this means that all conductances are zero in the large-@xmath59 limit , for one spin sector is empty and the other , completely filled .",
    "in contrast to this , for @xmath134 one of the two spin sectors may remain conducting .",
    "the crossover to the ordered state occurs at values of @xmath59 larger than @xmath135 which may be seen by simulating and comparing the occupation number for different states . for @xmath61",
    "the difference in occupation ( between the two spin sectors ) @xmath136 is shown in fig .",
    "[ stgmuzz ] ; for @xmath130 it is zero within error bars as long as @xmath137 .",
    "we conclude that for the values of @xmath59 considered in fig .",
    "[ huls ] the two spin sectors have approximately the same filling .",
    "in this paper we discussed the spin drag for the hubbard model at zero temperature .",
    "we found that the transconductance is negative  at half filling the umklapp even enforces @xmath107 . in",
    "that respect our situation is different from two coupled tomonaga - luttinger models as considered in refs .   which do not incorporate umklapp .",
    "the `` absolute - drag '' result of the form @xmath138 ( e.g. , from ref .  ) can only be recovered by introducing a spin - polarized interaction ( see appendix ) .",
    "if we assume that a given potential is in general not spin dependent , the only relevant quantity is the full conductance @xmath139 , which is only nonzero away from half filling . here",
    "both spin orientations contribute equally to the current .",
    "however , the situation changes when we add a magnetic impurity .",
    "even if the driving potential is still spin independent , the resulting current will be ( partially ) spin polarized , if we are away from half filling . in the limit of a large impurity potential the current",
    "will be fully spin polarized .",
    "in the hubbard model cis- and transconductance have opposite sign , in sharp contrast to the bosonization results ( for coupled spinless - fermion chains ) , where cis- and transcoductance are both positive .",
    "the discrepancy may come from the different modeling of the interaction . in the bosonization",
    "approaches each chain is given by an interacting system ( i.e , the luttinger - liquid parameter @xmath140 may differ from one ) , in the hubbard model each spin sector alone is represented by a noninteracting fermion system .",
    "we will show in this appendix that a spin - polarized interaction leads to a positive transconductance as found in the bosonization approaches . to this end",
    "we will now discuss the following variant of our hamiltonian : @xmath141 here the new @xmath142 term breaks the spin - rotational invariance .",
    "hence @xmath143 may now be different from one .",
    "first we consider the _",
    "large-@xmath59 limit at half filling .",
    "_ the @xmath59 term acts then as an effective projection to the configurations with exactly ( because of half filling ) one fermion per site , i.e. , @xmath144 .",
    "we now set - up an effective ( second - order perturbation theory ) hamiltonian . from the kinetic - energy term",
    "we get again a heisenberg model with exchange parameter @xmath145 . the @xmath142 term of the hamiltonian does not change the configuration ( in the occupation - number basis ) and gives therefore a direct energy contribution @xmath146 to the effective hamiltonian where @xmath92 denotes the spin of the fermion on site @xmath4 .",
    "the full effective hamiltonian reads @xmath147 and is an @xmath148 chain . if the anisotropy is larger than the hopping amplitude , i.e. , if @xmath149 , this model is gapped ( implying both a charge and a spin gap in the original model ) .",
    "we therefore expect that cis- and transconductance go to zero , if we increase @xmath59 and keep a finite @xmath150 .",
    "now we consider a _ zero chemical potential _ @xmath61 .",
    "we expect that this chemical potential shift away from half filling closes the charge gap , but leaves the spin gap more or less unaffected .",
    "we consider again the _",
