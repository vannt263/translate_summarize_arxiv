    "may keep only the main contribution , which is originated by the on - mass - shell pole of the diquark  while the remaining quark that interacts with the photon is taken to be off - mass - shell  @xcite .",
    "this last integration on the on - shell diquark internal momenta amounts to have the @xmath24 system as quark - diquark system , and to treat the diquark with an effective average mass @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "it is also an ingredient of the model that the electromagnetic quark current is represented by a parametrization of vector meson dominance  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the contributions from the core of valence quarks , the covariant spectator quark model can include also a covariant parametrization of the meson cloud effects that are important in the low momentum transfer region and that depend on the baryons participating in    here , the extension of the model to the timelike regime , requires two important modifications :    * the nucleon and the @xmath8 quark core wave functions have to be calculated in timelike kinematic conditions , depending on an arbitrary mass @xmath26 which can differ from the resonance mass , labeled as @xmath27 . *",
    "the electromagnetic quark current has also to be extended to the timelike regime . that is done introducing finite mass widths for the @xmath21 and @xmath28 mesons .",
