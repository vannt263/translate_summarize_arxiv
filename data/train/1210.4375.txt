    "contact between spheres has intrigued researchers for more than a century , and still no simple closed - form analytical solution exists .",
    "one of the first and most important developments in the field , due to heinrich hertz @xcite in 1881 , is an approximate solution for the normal , frictionless contact of linear elastic spheres .",
    "the major assumption in hertz s model is that the contact area was small compared to the radii of curvature , which has served as a useful engineering approximation in many applications .",
    "ever since then many have tried to relax this assumption while maintaining a compact , workable solution . the green s function for symmetric loading on a sphere provides the means to find the exact response for arbitrary loading , a first step towards improving on hertz classic solution .",
    "existing forms of the green s function are however not suitable for fast and ready computation , either due to slow convergence of series or analytically cumbersome expressions .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to provide an alternative form of the green s function suitable for fast computation of solutions under arbitrary loading .",
    "sternberg and rosenthal @xcite present an in - depth study of the nature of the singularities on elastic sphere loaded by two opposing concentrated point forces .",
    "as expected , the dominant inverse square singularity in the stress components can be removed by subtraction of an appropriate multiple of boussinesq s solution for a point load at the surface of a half space .",
    "sternberg and rosenthal showed that the quickly convergent residual field retains a weaker singularity of logarithmic form , a result that is also evident in the solution developed here .",
    "the singular solutions obtained by sternberg and rosenthal were extended to arbitrarily oriented point forces by guerrero et al .",
    "our interest here is in developing an analogous separation of the green s function ( circular ring loading ) . in this regard ,",
    "a relatively compact form of the green s function for the sphere was derived by bondareva @xcite who used it to solve the problem of the weighted sphere . in @xcite",
    ", bondareva formulates an example with a sphere contacting a rigid surface .",
    "this has been used to solve the rebound of a sphere from a surface @xcite .",
    "bondareva s solution starts with the known series expansion @xcite for the solution of the elasticity problem of a sphere , and replaces it with finite integrals of known functions .    in this paper",
    "we introduce an alternative form for the green s function for a sphere , comprised of analytical functions and a quickly convergent series .",
    "no direct integration is required .",
    "the methodology for determining the analytical functions is motivated by the simple example of a point load on a sphere , for which we derive a solution similar in spirit to that of @xcite , but using a fundamentally different approach : partial summation of infinite series as compared with a functional _ ansatz_. the present methods allows us to readily generalize the point load solution to arbitrary symmetric normal loading .",
    "a typical contact problem involves solving a complicated integral equation for the contact stress once a displacement is specified .",
    "instead , we will use the derived green s function in the direct sense , solving for the displacements for a given load .",
    "this is used to check the validity of hertz contact theory through the assumed form of the stress distribution .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the known series solution for symmetric loading on a sphere is reviewed in ",
    "[ sec2 ] . the proposed method for simplification",
    "is first illustrated in ",
    "[ sec3 ] by deriving a quickly convergent form of the solution for a point force .",

    "consider a solid sphere of radius @xmath0 , with surface @xmath1 , @xmath2 , in spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
