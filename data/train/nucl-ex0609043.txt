    "heavy - ion collisions are the only terrestrial means to explore the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions . in order to extract such nuclear matter properties , a clear understanding of the complex dynamics of heavy - ion collisions",
    "is required @xcite .",
    "the detected particles are indeed produced by different emission mechanisms and at different stages whose experimental identification is challenging .",
    "researchers have therefore intensively focused on obtaining a well defined dynamical and thermal characterization of particle and fragment emitting sources .",
    "where and when are fragments produced ?",
    "what are their thermal properties , i.e. excitation energy , internal temperature , or spin ? at what density",
    "do nuclear multifragmentation phenomena occur ?",
    "can we learn something about their link to a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter @xcite ?    in this chapter we will present a review of those research activities that have been devoted to finding answers to these questions . we will first focus on the space - time characterization of particle emitting sources , namely the estimation of their sizes , shapes , densities , lifetimes and emission chronology . this task has been extensively addressed with intensity - interferometry studies by exploring light particle - light particle and imf - imf ( intermediate - mass fragment ) correlation functions .",
    "the last section will be devoted to the thermal characterization of emitting sources by means of light particle - imf correlation function techniques , providing information about fragment internal excitation energies and the relative proportion of the thermal component .",
    "we will finally conclude with some remarks and perspectives for future research in this field .",
    "the space - time properties of heavy - ion collisions can be accessed by intensity interferometry @xcite .",
    "this technique was originally introduced in astronomy by hanbury - brown and twiss to measure astronomical distances , such as the radii of stars and galaxies @xcite .",
    "the technique was later extended to subatomic physics by goldhaber et al . who studied distributions of @xmath0 mesons in proton - antiproton annihilation processes @xcite .",
    "due to their bosonic nature , two - pion correlation functions show an enhancement at zero - relative momentum . the width of this enhancement provided information about the volume of the region emitting pions in the studied processes .",
    "pion - pion interferometry plays still today a key role in the study of heavy - ion collisions at ultra - relativistic energies where it is an important observable to investigate the production of the quark gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the use of intensity interferometry in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies is generally characterized by a more complicated scenario , as compared to the case of astronomical applications . during a nuclear reaction not only photons but several particle species can be emitted : neutrons , protons , complex particles or fragments .",
    "these emitted radiations can be either bosons or fermions , interacting with one another by means of repulsive coulomb and attractive nuclear forces .",
    "another important complication inherent to heavy - ion collisions is represented by the fact that the produced nuclear systems live for a very short time ranging between @xmath1 and @xmath2 seconds .",
    "this situation is very different from the case of astronomical objects , where the geometry of a static object is studied .",
    "moreover , in nuclear reactions different particles can be produced at different times and by different sources .",
    "therefore , only a full space - time characterization of all these multiple emitting sources can improve our understanding of heavy - ion collision dynamics .",
    "given two particles with momenta @xmath3 and @xmath4 , total momentum @xmath5 and momentum of relative motion @xmath6 , the two - particle correlation function , @xmath7 is defined experimentally by the following equation : @xmath8\\cdot\\sum y_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right)\\cdot y_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath9 is the two - particle coincidence yield while and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the single - particle yields .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath12 is commonly determined by the requirement @xmath13 at large relative momentum values , @xmath14 . in order to obtain sufficient statistics , the sums in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are performed over all detector and particle energy combinations satisfying a specific gating condition .",
    "experimental studies have therefore focused on two types of observables : _ directionally - gated _ and _ angle - averaged _ correlation functions .",
    "directionally - gated correlation functions are constructed by selecting particle pairs with specific conditions on the relative direction between the relative momentum , @xmath15 , and the total momentum , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "for instance , correlation functions with the vector @xmath15 either parallel or perpendicular to the vector @xmath16 have been extensively constructed @xcite .",
    "studies with such directional gates generally require high statistics .",
    "directional effects might indeed be small and difficult to analyze @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can study angle - averaged correlation functions by integrating over the relative angle between the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting correlation function depends only on the magnitude of the relative momentum , @xmath14 : @xmath17\\cdot\\sum y_{1}\\left(\\vec{p}_{1}\\right)\\cdot y_{2}\\left(\\vec{p}_{2}\\right)\\ ] ] experimentally , the product of the single yields , @xmath18 in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , has often been approximated with the uncorrelated two - particle yields , @xmath19 , constructed via the so - called event - mixing technique : particles 1 and 2 are taken from two different events and the correlation function is calculated as @xmath20 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show examples of angle - averaged proton - proton and deuteron - alpha correlation functions , respectively , represented as a function of the relative momentum @xmath14 between the particle pairs @xcite .",
    "if the two emitted particles were totally uncorrelated , the probability of detecting them in coincidence would be equal to the product of the probabilities of detecting the singles , i.e. @xmath21 , resulting in a flat correlation function , @xmath22 , at all @xmath14-values .",
    "experimentally it is easily observed that this is not the case . as one detects pairs at small relative momentum ,",
    "strong deviations from unity are observed .",
    "these deviations are due to quantum statistics and to the so - called final state interactions ( fsi ) @xcite . in the case of identical fermions ( bosons ) ,",
    "the relative wave function must respect anti - symmetrization ( symmetrization ) rules that induce measurable effects in the correlation function at small relative momenta @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the coincident particles can interact with their mutual coulomb and nuclear interaction .",
    "the coulomb repulsion is responsible for the anti - correlation at small q - values .",
    "the nuclear attractive force is responsible for the observed prominent peaks both in @xmath23 and @xmath24 correlation functions .    at large relative momenta , @xmath25 , the correlation functions shown in fig .",
    "1 and 2 appear as flat , @xmath26 , indicating the absence of correlations between the coincident particles .",
    "however , the presence of collective motion can generate correlation effects even at large relative momenta where the correlation function may significantly deviate from the limit , @xmath26 .",
    "if collective motion exists , the uncorrelated relative momentum distribution , constructed by mixing particles from different events , can contain additional collective components that do not exist in the coincidence spectrum .",
    "these additional contributions may affect the correlation function constructed from the ratio of the coincidence and the uncorrelated spectra @xcite .    in general ,",
    "the shape of the correlation function is sensitive to the space - time properties of particle emitting sources produced during the reaction @xcite . in order to properly access information about these emitting sources ,",
    "the use of detector arrays with a high angular and energy resolution is required .",
    "especially the angular resolution plays an important role in determining the exact location and the shape of the resonance peaks and in accessing the correlation function at very low relative momentum . in this respect ,",
    "position sensitive detectors and silicon strips have been quite successful thanks to their capability of providing relative angle measurements as small as 0.1@xmath27 - 0.3@xmath27 .",
    "intensity interferometry has extensively been used with protons , these particles being abundantly produced at all incident energies and easily detected with high resolution .",
    "theoretically , the proton - proton correlation function is calculated by the so - called _ koonin - pratt equation _",
    "( kp equation ) @xcite :    @xmath28    the goal of intensity interferometry consists of solving eq . ( 3 ) : from the measured correlation function on the l.h.s of eq .",
    "( 3 ) one needs to extract the unknown _ source function _ , @xmath29 .",
    "this source function is defined as the probability of emitting two particles at relative distance @xmath30 , calculated at the time when the last of the two particles is emitted . the so - called _ kernel function _ ,",
    "@xmath31 , can be calculated as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the proton - proton scattering wave function @xcite .",
    "the kernel contains all the information about the anti - symmetrization of the proton - proton wave function , due to their fermionic nature , and the mutual coulomb and nuclear final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "figure 3 shows correlation functions calculated with eq .",
    "( 3 ) by using a gaussian - shaped source function , @xmath34 , with width parameter values of @xmath35=2.5 fm ( small source , top panel ) and @xmath35=5 fm ( large source , bottom panel ) @xcite .",
    "gaussian sources have extensively been used in the literature due to their simplicity .",
    "the dashed lines in fig . 3 correspond to the correlation functions obtained for protons interacting only with the mutual coulomb force .",
    "this repulsive interaction between protons is responsible for the anti - correlation at small relative momentum , q@xmath3615  mev / c .",
    "the dotted line is obtained by adding the two - fermion anti - symmetrization in the two - proton wave function , inducing a further anti - correlation in the region q=15 - 60 mev / c , due to the pauli principle that prevents protons from occupying relative momentum states over an interval of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the spread of the proton spatial distribution in a certain direction @xmath39 .",
    "finally , when also the final state mutual nuclear interaction is included , the @xmath23 correlation functions displays a prominent peak at 20 mev / c .",
    "this peak is due to the s - partial wave of the proton - proton scattering problem and strongly depends on the volume of the emitting source . indeed ,",
    "when a large emitting source is used ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "3 ) , the peak height reduces significantly .",
    "the correlation functions displayed in fig . 3 have been determined assuming that the two protons are simultaneously emitted by a source with zero lifetime . however , proton emission is known to occur over finite timescales ( ranging from few tens of fm / c in the case of pre - equilibrium emission to thousands of fm / c in secondary decay processes ) .",
    "if the particle pairs are not emitted simultaneously , the source function is affected by a space - time ambiguity and will appear deformed , as it is schematically shown in fig .",
    "4 ( left panel ) @xcite .",
    "if @xmath35 is the actual geometrical source size , the source function appears elongated and with a larger size in the direction defined by the total momentum vector @xmath16 .",
    "the elongation is approximately given by @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 being , respectively , the average pair velocity and the emission lifetime . due to this deformation of the source function , the pauli suppression effect , described in fig .",
    "3 ( dotted lines ) , plays a key role in determining the shape of the correlation function . as it is schematically shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "4 , the transverse correlation function , constructed with the relative momentum , @xmath15 , perpendicular to the total momentum , @xmath16 , will undergo a larger pauli suppression as compared to the correlation function constructed by selecting a relative momentum , @xmath15 , parallel to the total momentum , @xmath16 .",
    "this simple qualitative argument shows that directionally - gated correlation functions allow one to disentangle the space and time information hidden in the source function , providing quantitative estimates of both source size and lifetime @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of directional correlation functions to finite lifetimes and emission volumes has stimulated an extensive research activity in the field of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "figure 5 shows two - proton correlation functions measured in central ar+sc collisions at e / a=80 mev and for proton pairs with total momenta p=400 - 600 mev / c @xcite .",
    "the filled and open circles correspond , respectively to longitudinal and transverse correlation functions . a stronger pauli suppression in the transverse direction",
    "is observed , as compared to the longitudinal direction .",
    "these results are one of the first experimental evidences of the predicted lifetime effects in two - proton correlation functions . in the same reaction",
    ", protons at higher total momenta showed no directional dependence @xcite , consistent with negligible lifetime effects . indeed , these fast protons are dominated by rapidly decaying pre - equilibrium sources .",
    "the directional correlations in fig .",
    "5 were analyzed by using the koonin - pratt equation , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , assuming a source function composed by a gaussian spatial distribution and an exponentially decaying time profile , @xmath43 .",
    "the simultaneous best - fit of longitudinal and transverse correlations provided source radii and lifetimes of @xmath35=4.5 - 4.8 fm and @xmath42=10 - 30 fm / c , respectively .",
    "the obtained geometrical size , @xmath35=4.5 - 4.8 fm , is comparable to the size of the overlapping region in central ar+sc collisions .",
    "the extracted short lifetime was interpreted as consistent with proton sources dominated by the early pre - equilibrium stage of the reaction .",
    "these results were also predicted by buu transport models that are expected to well describe the dynamical early stages of the reaction @xcite .",
    "directional correlation functions have also been used to characterize proton evaporation from long - lived nuclear systems at relatively low excitation energies @xcite . in the study of quasi - compound projectiles produced in @xmath44xe + @xmath45al",
    "reactions at e / a=31 mev @xcite , a lifetime of the order of @xmath46  1300 fm / c and a source size of @xmath47  2.2 fm were obtained .",
    "however , this source size appeared small as compared to the size of the evaporating compound system .",
    "the difficulty in explaining the results was attributed by the authors to possible model dependences in the source parametrization .",
    "similar difficulties have been encountered in the study of @xmath48s+@xmath49ag reactions at e / a = 22.3 mev / u @xcite .",
    "directional two - proton correlation functions were used to explore both pre - equilibrium emission ( fast sources ) and proton evaporation ( slow source ) from the produced compound nuclei . in both cases no significant difference between transverse and longitudinal correlation functions were observed .",
    "while this observation can be expected in the case of pre - equilibrium emission , the absence of any directional effects for low energy protons evaporated from compound nuclei appeared controversial .",
    "the space - time properties of heavy - ion collisions at relativistic incident energies were explored by the fopi and the aladin collaborations @xcite to access information about nuclear densities and to study the temporal evolution of excited nuclear systems .",
    "figure 6 shows directional two - proton correlation functions measured in central @xmath50zr(@xmath50ru)+@xmath50zr(@xmath50ru ) collisions at e / a=400 mev @xcite . a very small pauli suppression in the transverse correlation function ( solid point ) as compared to the longitudinal correlation function ( open points ) is observed .",
    "this suppression is consistent with a slightly deformed gaussian source characterized by a negligible lifetime and a geometrical size of about @xmath47  5.4 fm @xcite .",
    "the obtained negligible lifetime can be attributed to the presence of a strong collective motion and the consequent decrease of emission timescales in participant matter .",
    "longer emission lifetimes can be expected in the decay of spectator matter produced in peripheral collisions @xcite .",
    "the left panels in fig . 7 show transverse ( closed symbols ) and longitudinal ( open symbols ) two - proton correlation functions measured in the decay of target spectators produced in au+au collisions at e / a=1 gev @xcite .",
    "the data from the top to the bottom are obtained by imposing different gates on the z@xmath51 observable , defined as the sum of the charges of all fragments with z@xmath522 and emitted by projectile spectators @xcite .",
    "z@xmath51 increases with increasing impact parameter and decreasing spectator excitation - energy .",
    "these directional correlation functions provided lifetimes @xmath53  20 fm / c and source radii @xmath47  8 fm , independently of z@xmath51 . from an estimate of the amount of nucleons in the decaying spectator it was possible to deduce densities ranging between @xmath54  0.15 and @xmath54  0.4 . even in the case of spectator decay , the obtained lifetimes appear to be rather short .",
    "high proton identification thresholds @xcite could result in correlation functions that are dominated by fast particles emerging from the short - lived pre - equilibrium emission stages of the reaction . on the other hand , other authors have investigated the intrinsic small sensitivity of directional correlation functions to those long lifetimes typical of evaporation processes and secondary decays .",
    "can one probe the time structure of proton emissions when lifetimes of the order of @xmath5510@xmath56 - 10@xmath57 fm / c exist ?",
    "in ref . @xcite it was observed that , if the emission lifetime is very long , longitudinal and transverse correlation functions become undistinguishable and , as a result , a quantitative extraction of the lifetime itself becomes difficult .",
    "angle - averaged correlation functions are constructed experimentally by removing any conditions on the angle between the relative and the total momentum of the emitted proton pairs . from this point of view",
    ", these observables do not require as high statistics as in the case of directionally gated correlation functions . in order to extract physics information",
    ", one needs to use the _ angle - averaged _ koonin - pratt equation @xcite :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the angle - averaged kernel .",
    "the resulting spherically symmetric source function , @xmath60 , contains information about its spatial extent and its finite lifetimes folded together in the value of the relative distance , @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , it is not easy to disentangle the space - time ambiguity contained in the emitting source .",
    "however , even under these limited conditions , angle - averaged correlation functions have provided space - time information about particle emission mechanisms .    in order to solve the angle - averaged koonin - pratt equation , eq .",
    "( 4 ) , and extract information about the emitting source function , @xmath60 , different approaches have been proposed . in the following subsections we will present the main results obtained with _",
    "gaussian source approaches _ and _ imaging techniques_.      in fig .",
    "8 angle - averaged two - proton correlation functions measured in @xmath62n+@xmath63au reactions at e / a=75 mev are shown for three different gates on the total momentum of detected proton pairs , p=270 - 390 , 450 - 780 and 840 - 1230 mev / c @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to best - fits of the experimental data with eq .",
    "( 4 ) , where the source function is assumed to be characterized by a gaussian shape , @xmath64 .",
    "gaussian source sizes , @xmath35=5.9 , 4.2 and 3.4 were obtained , respectively , for p=270 - 390 , 450 - 780 and 840 - 1230",
    "mev / c .",
    "the total momentum dependence of two - proton correlation functions , shown in fig .",
    "8 , has been extensively explored in the literature .",
    "figure 9 shows a collection of gaussian source sizes measured in reactions induced by different projectiles ( @xmath56he , @xmath62n , @xmath65o and @xmath66ar ) impinging on au and ag targets @xcite .",
    "source sizes are represented as a function of the average velocity of the coincident proton pairs , @xmath67 , normalized to the beam velocity , @xmath68 .",
    "the observed decrease of the size of the emitting source with increasing proton velocities has been interpreted as a consequence of the cooling dynamics of the produced nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "energetic protons are associated with small sources as one would expect in the case of emissions at the early stages of the reaction . for less energetic protons , however , the extracted source radii increase as one would expect at the later stage when the system is cooled and expanded .",
    "the systematics of two - proton radii with the size of the interacting projectile and target nuclei is more involved .",
    "the data points corresponding to reactions induced by @xmath62n and @xmath65o projectiles overlap and are interpolated by a dashed line .",
    "the other two dashed lines are obtained by multiplying and dividing the @xmath62n/@xmath65o line by a factor proportional to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the mass number of the projectile nuclei .",
    "it is clear that for high energy protons , @xmath71  0.5 , where fast pre - equilibrium emission plays an important role , the two - proton source radius scales approximately with the radius of the projectile .",
    "this scaling with the radius of projectile nuclei is not observed in the case of low energy protons that are known to be predominantly emitted by evaporation and secondary - decay processes .",
    "the presence of such long - lifetime emissions makes two - proton correlation functions more difficult to be interpreted .",
    "this is confirmed by the difficulty in reproducing the shape of the experimental data for pairs at low total momenta ( see fig . 8) .",
    "the gaussian radii @xmath35 shown in fig .",
    "9 must be considered as upper bounds for the actual source sizes . indeed , since angle - averaged source function",
    "fold space and time extents together , a small size could correspond both to a small emitting volume or to short proton emission times . on the other hands ,",
    "the use of gates on total momentum or , alternatively , on proton velocities is expected to reduce the space - time ambiguities contained in the angle - averaged correlation function . indeed , these gates should help to isolate , to some extent , more localized emitting sources .",
    "stimulated by these ideas , the chic collaboration has used statistical event generators to simulate total - momentum gated correlation functions and estimate emission lifetime and spatial extents in ni+al reactions at e / a=45 mev @xcite .",
    "the authors explored also the existence of a possible overlap of multiple sources with different lifetimes ( corresponding to pre - equilibrium and evaporative emissions ) . due to the selectivity of the total momentum gate , it was still possible to estimate both a spatial gaussian source size , @xmath72=2.7@xmath730.3 , and an emission lifetime , @xmath74400@xmath73200 fm / c .",
    "systematic studies of source sizes in central ca+ca and au+au collisions with varying incident energies have been recently performed by the fopi collaboration @xcite .",
    "the size of the two - proton source is observed to decrease as the incident energy is increased from e / a= 400 mev to e / a = 1500 mev . in the case of au+au reactions ,",
    "the source size decreases from 5.0 fm to 4.1 fm .",
    "a smaller source size change is observed in the case of ca+ca collisions .",
    "this result is consistent with participant matter which is compressed to higher and higher densities as one increases the incident energy .",
    "this indication is quite attractive and further work on the details of these two - proton correlation functions can provide useful tools to investigate the nuclear equation of state .",
    "the importance of studying the detailed shape of two - proton correlation functions was recently addressed by introducing an imaging approach to intensity interferometry @xcite .",
    "this imaging technique consists of extracting the source profile , @xmath60 , by a numerical inversion of the koonin - pratt equation , eq . ( 6 ) .",
    "no a - priori assumptions about the source shape are made , thus considerably reducing model dependences .",
    "figure 10 shows an application of the imaging technique to two - proton correlation functions measured in @xmath62n+@xmath63au collisions at e / a=75 mev @xcite .",
    "the thick lines on the left panel of the figure represent the imaged measured correlation functions .",
    "the imaging technique reproduces in details the entire shape of the correlation functions . on the right panel of fig .",
    "10 the extracted imaging profiles are also shown .",
    "contrary to the case of gaussian source analyses shown in fig .",
    "8 , the source size does not decrease with increasing proton pair total momentum , remaining constant at about 3 fm .",
    "this result is very different from the systematics shown in fig .",
    "9 , where the source size was mostly extracted from the height of the peak at 20 mev / c .",
    "this constancy of the source size with increasing total momentum of the protons shows that the height of the peak at 20 mev / c does not provide unambiguous information about the size of the source @xcite .",
    "these results have been explained within a simple scenario where protons are emitted by the overlap of a fast source , corresponding to pre - equilibrium emissions , and a slow source representing the last stages dominated by secondary decays of excited fragments @xcite . in this schematic model ,",
    "fast emissions provide a fraction f of the total proton yields , @xmath75 , while the slow secondary decay sources provide the remainder , @xmath76 . in this limit , the profiles extracted from the imaging analysis of the experimental @xmath77 at q@xmath7810 mev / c and shown on the right panel of fig .",
    "10 are strongly dominated by the dynamical source .",
    "the size of this source is determined by the width or , even better , by the shape of the peak at 20 mev / c .",
    "the detailed study of the shape provides also a measure of the relative contributions of the fast source , @xmath79 , and of the slow source , @xmath80 .",
    "this fast / slow contributions represent new physics information contained in proton - proton correlation functions , opening the opportunity to constrain the importance of secondary decays .",
    "the detailed shape of the long - lived portion of the emitting source contributes to the source function @xmath60 at large relative distance values , @xmath8110 fm , where the kernel @xmath82 is dominated by the coulomb interaction .",
    "these large distances influence the correlation function only at very small relative momenta , @xmath8310 mev / c , where measurements are difficult because of the finite angular resolution typical of the used experimental setups @xcite .",
    "therefore , the details of these slow emitting sources @xmath8110 fm are hard to access . in fig .",
    "10 , the observed quasi - gaussian shapes refer only to the fast source .",
    "this is demonstrated by the fact that their integral over relative distances r is less than unity .",
    "if the slowly emitting sources could be experimentally accessed by measuring very low relative momentum particle pairs , it would be possible to image even the tails of the source profiles at large relative distances . in that case",
    ", one would clearly observe how the emitting source can deviate significantly from the simplified gaussian shapes assumed in most works on two - proton correlation functions .",
    "such detailed studies on the shape of two - proton correlation functions require high resolution experiments that represent a challenge for the future .    with the introduction of imaging analyses , the systematics of proton - proton source sizes shown in fig .",
    "9 is expected to change . on the other hand ,",
    "such high order shape analyses require high resolution measurements that certainly represent a challenging perspective for the future .",
    "considerable experimental efforts have also been devoted to the measurement of correlation functions involving non - charged radiations ( neutrons and photons ) .",
    "figure 11 shows two - neutron correlation functions measured in ni+al , ni , au reactions at e / a=45 mev @xcite .",
    "these measurements are very complicated because of cross - talk problems : the interaction and registration of the same neutron in two different detectors , can substantially affect neutron coincidence measurements @xcite .",
    "the neutron - neutron correlation function is dominated by the fermionic nature of the neutrons and by their mutual nuclear final state interaction . unlike the case of proton - proton correlation functions ,",
    "no coulomb anti - correlation at small relative momenta exists .",
    "the strong maximum at zero relative momentum is caused by the same resonance that brings about the maximum in the @xmath23 correlation function and has been used to investigate the time - scale of the emission and to study the interplay between dynamical and statistical effects @xcite .",
    "similarly to what was observed in the case of protons , the height of this maximum increases with increasing two - neutron total momentum @xcite , indicating reduced time scales for the emission of more energetic particles emerging from the pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "the simultaneous study of @xmath23 and @xmath84 correlation functions in ni+al reactions at e / a=45 mev by means of the csorgo - helgesson statistical model ( ref . @xcite and references therein )",
    "has provided comparable source radii of @xmath72=2.7@xmath730.3 fm for both protons and neutrons .",
    "however , slightly larger timescales , with lifetimes of the order of @xmath85  600@xmath73200  fm / c , appeared to be associated with neutron emission , if compared to protons emitted with lifetimes of about @xmath74  400@xmath73200 fm / c @xcite .    the enhancement at small relative momenta observed in the n - n correlation function in fig .",
    "11 is due to the short - range nuclear final - state interaction .",
    "however , if neutrons are emitted from a long - lived decaying system , the increased average spatial separation between successive nucleons will reduce the significance of the final state strong interaction . the correlation function",

    "this anti - correlation is generated by the anti - symmetrization of the n - n wave function and represents the first experimental evidence of a pure fermionic hbt effect .",

    "the second peak is observed at slightly higher relative momenta if pairs with @xmath95 are selected .",

    "the study of emission chronology is indeed very important in order to improve our understanding of particle production mechanisms in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "particles originating from one specific source are emitted during a certain time interval .",
    "normally , the rate of emitted particles changes during this time interval , leading to a specific time distribution for the source . if a two - particle correlation function of identical particles could be constructed from particles emitted from a single source ( i.e. if the particle source could be isolated ) , and if the spatial distribution would be known , then the shape of the correlation function would yield information on the shape of the time distribution .",
    "normally , neither the spatial nor the temporal distributions are known . in this case",
    "it is not straightforward to extract the spatial and time distributions from the shape of the correlation function . to interpret the experimental results ,",
    "source models are often used .",
    "these source models contain some pre - assumption on the spatial and temporal distributions .",
    "the shape of these distributions can , to some extent , be varied by varying parameters of the model ( such as radius and temporal width parameters ) .",
    "such parameters then represent average emission point and average emission time , though it should be remembered that such average values are model dependent . in experimental data",
    "the situation is much more complex , since it is never possible to completely isolate one source from all the other sources present during the reaction .",
    "the contribution from several sources leads to a total time distribution with a complex shape , where the effective average emission time will depend on different factors .",
    "what one is usually referring to with _ emission chronology _ is a difference in the average emission times between two particle types .",
    "though , it is worth noticing that the emission times of the two particles may overlap to a large extent , and the difference in their respective average emission times can be small compared with the width of the emission time distributions .",
    "furthermore , if different sources contribute , like in peripheral reactions , they contribute to a complex time distribution of the emitted particles . as an example",
    ", we can consider two particle types emitted from two sources .",
    "different origins for different average emission times can be recognized : one origin could be a simple shift of two similar time distributions .",
    "another origin could be that the width of the time distributions are different , while their shape is quite similar . finally , it is also possible to think that , if more than one source is contributing , the relative weight of the sources is different for the two particle types , leading to different average emission times . in a real reaction ,",
    "all of the above reasons contribute , with a different weight depending for example on applied gatesor selected angular ranges .",
    "even though the extraction of the emission times and sequences is quite involved , there is a wealth of experi- mental information that is available .",
    "a great advantage is to perform simultaneous measurements of both like and unlike particle correlation functions . by applying different gates , such as polar angle gates , total momentum gates , directional gates , or velocity gates for unlike particles",
    ", certain sources are enhanced relative to others .",
    "for instance , non - equilibrium emission can be enhanced by high and intermediate total momentum gates , while particles from evaporation and excited fragments can be suppressed by shape analyses disregarding the very low relative momentum region . furthermore , single particle information , such as energy spectra at different angles , should be used in the analysis .",
    "a systematic study can , therefore , to a large extent disentangle the space - time characteristics of the contributing sources , thereby putting strong constraints on theoretical models .",
    "the emission chronology between two particle types can , under certain conditions , be determined from like - particle correlation functions . if it is valid to assume that both particle types are emitted from the same spatial region , a fit with a calculated correlation function , based on some source function , to the experimental correlation function , will yield an average emission time for each particle type . by comparing these average emission times",
    ", an emission chronology can be inferred . for a review ,",
    "see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "the same method can also be used to determine differences in emission times for the same particle type emitted from different systems but with the same spatial region , for instance , different neutron emission times from systems similar in size and energy content , but with different isospin content ( see next section ) .",
    "the drawback of this method is that the results are sensitive to the assumption of emission from the same spatial region .",
    "furthermore , the extracted average emission times are model dependent , since the average emission times depend on the pre - assumption of the shape of the ( spatial and ) temporal distributions assumed by the specific source model .",
    "model independent information on the emission chronology of two particle types can instead be obtained from unlike - particle correlation functions .",
    "if there is a difference in the average emission times , it is possible , by suitable gates , to divide the particle pairs into two classes with different average distances when the two particles `` start to interact '' .",
    "since the strength of the final state interaction depends on the distance between the particles , this will lead to a different strength of the correlation function for the two classes . by comparing these correlation functions , the emission chronology",
    "can then be inferred without any model assumptions .",
    "below we present the details of this technique . an important assumption for this method to be valid is that the particles are emitted independently .",
    "furthermore , certain assumptions ( which depends on the used gates ) must be made on the spatial region from which the particles are emitted .",
    "a technique to probe the emission sequence and time delay of ejectiles in nuclear reactions was first suggested for charged particle pairs , based on the idea that mutual coulomb repulsion would be experienced by pairs of charged particles emitted with a short time delay .",
    "comparison of the velocity difference spectra with trajectory calculations would thus give a measure of the average particle emission sequence @xcite .",
    "the technique was extended to any kind of interacting , non - identical particle pairs in the theoretical study of ref .",
    "@xcite . there",
    "it was demonstrated that the sensitivity of the correlation function to the asymmetry of the distribution of the relative space - time coordinates of the particle emission points can be used to determine the differences in the mean emission times by applying energy or velocity gates .",
    "this effect has been proposed for particle pairs such as @xmath104 and @xmath105 @xcite , @xmath106 @xcite , @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "velocity gated correlation functions of non - identical particles is a very powerful tool to investigate emission sequences in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that , if there is an average time difference in the emission times of two particles types , there will also be a difference in the average distance for particle pairs selected with the condition @xmath108 as compared to the pairs selected with the complementary condition @xmath109 .",
    "this is because the particle emitted first will , on average , travel a different distance in the two complementary classes ( due to the different velocities ) before the second particle is emitted .",
    "in particular , the interaction is enhanced for those pairs for which the average distance is smaller .",
    "this can be easily seen if one compares the correlation function @xmath110 , gated on pairs @xmath108 , with the correlation function @xmath111 , gated on pairs @xmath109 .",
    "if particle 2 is emitted earlier ( later ) than particle 1 , than the condition @xmath108 will sample smaller distances ( larger correlations ) than the complementary condition @xmath109 .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath112 will show a peak ( dip ) in the region of relative momentum q where there is a correlation and a dip ( peak ) where there is an anti - correlation .",
    "furthermore the ratio @xmath112 will approach unity both for @xmath113 ( since the velocity difference of the two emitted particles is negligible ) and @xmath114 ( since modifications of the two - particle phase space density arising from final state interactions are negligible ) .",
    "the exact location of the peak and dip in the ratio depends on the source , and in particular on the origin of the difference in the average emission times .      at low energies ,",
    "the analysis of two - particle correlations and velocity difference spectra has allowed to find results consistent with the statistical compound nucleus decay for the light products emitted from the reactions @xmath65o+@xmath115b ( e@xmath116=62.5 mev ) , and @xmath65o+@xmath117c ( 64 mev ) .",

    "recently , the two - nucleon correlation function has been considered as a probe for the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite . in these theoretical studies with an isospin - dependent ibuu transport model , it was shown that the density dependence of the symmetry term of the eos affects the temporal and spatial structure of reaction dynamics by affecting the average emission times of neutrons and protons as well as their relative emission sequence .",
    "for central collisions , a stiff eos causes high momentum neutrons and protons to be emitted almost simultaneously , thereby leading to strong correlations . a soft eos delays proton emission , which weakens the @xmath105 correlation @xcite .",
    "it was found that the symmetry energy effect becomes weaker with increasing impact parameter and incident energy .",
    "also , the strength of the nucleon - nucleon correlation function is reduced in collisions of heavier reaction systems as a result of larger nucleon emission source @xcite .",
    "it was further found that the momentum dependence of both isoscalar nuclear potential and the symmetry potential influences significantly the space - time properties of the nucleon emission source . specifically , the momentum dependence of the nuclear potential reduces the sensitivity of two - nucleon correlation functions to the stiffness of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite .    in spite of the large uncertainties in the symmetry potential , and in particular in the momentum dependent part , the exploratory studies in @xcite are very encouraging for using two - particle correlations to study the symmetry potential .",
    "it is also important to remember that the symmetry interaction does not only influence the dynamical emission of particles from the overlap and neck - like regions , but also the formation of the residues .",
    "therefore also the particles emitted from the residues contain information on the symmetry energy .",

    "neutrons are expected to be emitted faster in the neutron - rich system , which would lead to an enhancement of the correlation strength for @xmath89ar+@xmath136sn .",

    "the stronger @xmath105 correlation observed for the larger ar+@xmath136sn system in the low - total - momentum gate may indicate that the more asymmetric system generates a more asymmetric and excited target residue that , consequently , decays on a faster time scale .",

    "it was found that neutrons are , on average , emitted earlier than protons .",

    "these results indicate a transition from a surface evaporation - like emission at low excitation energies towards a bulk simultaneous multifragmentation scenario above excitation energies of the order of e*/a=5 mev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the extracted emission times seem to be comparable with timescales of thermodynamical fluctuations leading to liquid - gas phase transitions in nuclear matter .",
    "the decreasing emission times should be related to the increasing thermal excitation energy deposited into the system .",
    "contrary to the case of central collisions presented in the previous subsection , only a small collective - motion component caused by the thermal expansion of the system should exist and the dynamics of the decay is mostly dominated by thermodynamical aspects .",

    "the quantum molecular dynamic ( qmd ) model @xcite and the microcanonical metropolis monte carlo ( mmmc ) model @xcite predict a rather low excitation energy for primary fragments . antisymmetrized molecular dynamics @xcite ( amd ) , stochastic mean field simulations @xcite , the statistical multifragmentation model @xcite ( smm ) and microcanonical multifragmentation models @xcite predict moderately hot primary fragments .",
    "moreover , the mechanism responsible for the formation of fragments differs from a model to another . in dynamical models ,",
    "the formation of the fragments and their excitation energy depend not only on the collision dynamics but also on the procedure employed for performing the cluster recognition @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of statistical models ,",

    "therefore , experimental estimates of the importance of secondary decays and of the size of the primary fragments can provide very significant constraints and crucial tests for the theoretical models .",
    "a direct measurement of these quantities would be also interesting for various aspects : the extraction of certain physical information , such as the rate of statistically to dynamically emitted particles or the caloric heat capacity @xcite , would be less dependent on model assumptions .",
    "previous studies have shown that it is possible to extract the intrinsic properties of the fragments independently of the mechanism of their formation .",
    "these studies are based on the measurement of relative - velocity correlation functions between fragments and light charged particles ( lcp ) .",
    "the aim of this section is to give a review of the work dedicated to the determination of the sizes and excitation energies of primary fragments .",

    "it is important to note that the same data can provide information on the space - time extend of the outgoing fragments , but in this section we will concentrate only in the measurement of their excitation energy .      at intermediate energies ,",
    "there are at least two extreme mechanisms for the production of light particles , ( i ) in nucleon - nucleon collisions and ( ii ) by statistical evaporation from excited sources .",
    "the former occurs during the first stage of the collision when the dynamics play an important role .",
    "this process is called direct or pre - equilibrium emission .",
    "the second process is supposed to occur at later stages of the reaction as a secondary emission from excited primary fragments . between these two stages ,",
    "continuous emission may occur from other sources that are difficult to define . in multifragmentation events , it is possible to isolate the secondary statistical component if the fragments formed are not too excited , so that the time scale associated with their decay is much larger than the time scale of their production .    in this context",
    "the primary fragment excitation energy can be deduced from the multiplicity of its associated evaporated lcps .",

    "this feature may correspond to the coulomb ring associated with the proton emission from the heaviest fragment . in order to estimate quantitatively the amount of evaporated protons from secondary decay processes",

    "few methods have been employed to perform such background estimation and subtraction @xcite and they are all based on a scenario deduced from boltzmann - nordheim - vlasov @xcite calculations .",
    "multifragmentation is described as a two - step process .",
    "the first step is the cooling of the initial fused system through a sequence of light - particle - emission processes .",
    "the second step is the fragmentation of the smaller remaining source where the remaining excitation energy is shared between a fixed number of primary fragments .",
    "these fragments then decay sequentially while moving apart under the influence of the coulomb force .",
    "an initial radial velocity can be added to the coulomb motion in order to mimic a possible expansion of the source .",
    "based on such a scenario and on model predictions , two approaches have been suggested to estimate the background of the correlation function , differing in the way one compares calculations to experimental data . in one case ,",
    "the shape of the background is deduced , normalized to the data and then subtracted @xcite . in the other case ,",

    "this procedure was applied to all fragment - lcp pairs produced in the central collisions xe + sn at e / a = 32 , 39 , 45 and 50 mev .",
    "thus , for each detected fragment , the average multiplicities of the light particles evaporated by the primary fragment was determined .",
    "these multiplicities increase slightly with the size of the fragment",
    ". however they remain weak , not exceeding the value of 1.5 at all incident energies , implying that the excitation energy of the primary fragments is particularly moderate .",
    "an example of the extracted multiplicity is given in fig .",

    "this last quantity is defined by @xmath183 , where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the charge and the average multiplicity of the evaporated particles , @xmath186 .",
    "since the isotopes of the detected fragments are not resolved and the neutrons are not detected , two extreme assumptions were necessary in order to determine the primary mass of the fragment .",
    "the first assumption consists of assuming that the detected fragment is produced in the valley of stability .",
    "the second assumption considers two cases : i ) the primary fragments are produced in the valley of stability ; ii ) the primary fragments keep the same ratio n / z as the initial system .",
    "the obtained charge of the primary fragments varies between 1 and 5 units of charge in addition to the charge of the detected fragment .",

    "on the other hand , the saturation of @xmath189 can indicate that the fragments have reached their limiting excitation energy per nucleon ( or their limiting temperature ) @xcite .    how to choose between the two assumptions of mass on the primary fragments ?",
    "this choice was dictated by calculations with a statistical code gemini @xcite .",
    "this code is very well suited at low excitation energies not exceeding 3 - 4 amev .",

    "the data points obtained above for central collisions and same system but at a lower beam energy e / a=50 mev are superimposed on the same figure .",
    "all data points follow the same systematic : the evaporated proton multiplicity increases with the charge of the quasi - projectile or with the charge of the fragment ( in the case of central collisions ) .",
    "the proton multiplicity values do not exceed 1.5 and are compatible with an excitation energy of 2 - 3 amev .",
    "the experimental estimate of the secondary decay component can be compared with the predictions of statistical multifragmentation models such as the smm @xcite or the micro - canonical model of raduta et al .",
    "@xcite which explicitly consider fragment excitation .",
    "the comparison of the extracted quantities with the calculations can indeed constitute a crucial test of the basic assumptions of these models . in the mmmc @xcite approach , the excitation of primary fragments is implicitly included in the neutron production at freeze - out , and a direct comparison is not possible .",
    "statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) calculations have been performed in order to reproduce the thermal component .",
    "the version of smm used in @xcite gives access to the freeze - out configuration , i.e. , to primary - fragment characteristics before secondary decay .",
    "figure 35 shows the results of this calculation .",
    "the left panel in this figure represents the excitation energy in mev of the primary fragments as a function of their atomic number ( same data points as in fig . 31 with the only difference being the use of mev / nucleon as units of excitation energies ) .",
    "the right panel represents the total charge contributions of secondary evaporated particles , @xmath192 .",
    "the data indicate that a maximum lcp evaporation is obtained for e / a = 39 mev and a decrease of thermal contribution takes place above this energy .",
    "although the internal excitation energy of the primary fragments is well reproduced at each incident energy , the trend of the total charge of secondary lcps , @xmath192 , with the beam energy is not reproduced .",
    "this discrepancy can be understood if we consider the increasingly important effects of the collision dynamics as the beam energy increases .",
    "direct emissions of lcp increase with increasing incident energy , while the proportion of the thermal contribution decreases .",
    "the obtained results have also been compared to dynamical calculations . in order to understand the mechanism responsible for the saturation of the excitation energy of the primary fragments observed in fig .",
    "33 , amd calculations @xcite for central collisions of xe + sn at e / a=50 mev have been performed . a reasonably good agreement for the charge distribution , the charge of the heaviest fragment in the event and average kinetic energy of the fragments",
    "has been obtained @xcite .",
    "the comparison of such calculations to the experimental data is shown in fig .",
    "it represents the energy spectra of proton and alpha particles produced as free particles in amd ( direct emission ) and secondary particles evaporated from the calculated decay of the excited primary fragments .",
    "the two contributions are compared to experimentally deduced secondary particles with the method described above .",
    "amd predicts reasonably well the total energy spectra of protons ( 78% of total emission ) , but it fails to reproduce the thermal contribution ( 22% ) .",
    "the study of heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies has provided important information about the mechanisms of multifragmentation and their links to a possible nuclear liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "our capability of fully understanding these phenomena depends strongly on how well one can identify and characterize the thermal and dynamical properties of fragment and particle emitting sources . in this chapter",
    "we have presented a review of the most significant results that different research groups have achieved in the last decades by using two - particle correlation techniques .",
    "intensity interferometry techniques have demonstrated that we have _ space - time probes capable of measuring sizes as small as 10@xmath193 m and time intervals as short as several 10@xmath159sec_. this can be viewed as an important advance in the field of heavy - ion physics .",
    "these space - time characterization techniques have provided valuable information about the size / volume , the density of decaying nuclear systems , as well as quantitative estimates of emission lifetimes and particle chronology .",
    "the extracted results demonstrate that the emitting sources produced in heavy - ion collisions form a quite complex system : different particles are emitted at different times and by different mechanisms . in this respect",
    ", it seems clear that a complete space - time characterization of nuclear reactions requires a study of multiple correlations extended to all particle species and including neutrons .",
    "proton - neutron chronology is also indicated as an important candidate to explore the density dependence of the symmetry energy which represents one of the most challenging perspectives for the future .",
    "the recent introduction of imaging techniques has certainly changed our interpretation of correlation observables .",
    "the source sizes extracted with this technique can differ significantly from those extracted from other approaches .",
    "this difference suggests that a detailed shape analysis of correlation observables is necessary in order to obtain a correct determination of nuclear densities and lifetimes . in this chapter",
    "we have also shown how techniques were found to quantify the strength of secondary decays .",
    "light particle - fragment correlations have been used to extract information about the excitation energy of primary unstable fragments .",
    "the possibility of constraining secondary decays represents an important perspective : several observables are indeed affected by the unknown contributions to the experimental spectra from different emission mechanisms dominating different stages of the reaction .    despite the large amount of information that the scientific community has been able to extract ,",
    "certain aspects have not been fully explored and require further research .",
    "for instance , from an experimental point of view , higher isotopic resolution could provide an important opportunity to investigate isotopically resolved fragment - fragment correlation functions .",
    "this perspective is very important in view of clarifying the indications of evolutionary freeze - out conditions in heavy - ion collisions and their possible links to the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter , relevant to astrophysical environments like neutron stars and supernova explosions .",
    "higher angular resolution and a large solid angle coverage are important requirements in order to increase the quality of measured correlation observables and to explore their features while having a complete characterization of the collision event ( impact parameter , reaction plane , exact determination of velocity vectors , etc . ) .",
    "higher resolution devices will be the key to the perspective of extending imaging techniques to several particle species , improving complex particle correlation analyses that provide information about the space - time properties at freeze - out and about the excitation energies of primary fragments .",
    "other fields of nuclear physics research will certainly profit from the existence of detector setups that are characterized by outstanding correlation capabilities .",
    "this is particularly the case for the nuclear structure groups working on spectroscopic properties of exotic nuclear systems explored with the future radioactive - ion - beam accelerator facilities .",
    "the close interaction between the theoretical and experimental communities will certainly contribute significantly in improving our capability of characterizing emitting sources .",
    "the use of more powerful experimental setups and the implementation of full quantum multi - body approaches to correlation functions promise to provide unambiguous information about the thermal and dynamical scenarios characterizing multifragmention phenomena and their links to the equation of state of nuclear matter .",
