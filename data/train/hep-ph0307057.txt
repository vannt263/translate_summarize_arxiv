    "the agreement between the theoretical predictions of the standard model ( sm ) of the electroweak interactions and experiment is established to an impressive degree @xcite .",
    "the only missing ingredient is the higgs boson that yet has to be discovered .",
    "however , there are compelling theoretical reasons for believing that the electroweak standard model is merely a low energy approximation to a more fundamental theory that should become visible at tev scale energies .",
    "thus indications on the underlying theory should be found by experiments at the lhc or at future linear colliders ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these future experiments pose the challenge to theorists to make predictions for processes with many particles in the final state .",
    "this is a general signature for processes with heavy , unstable particles in intermediate states that have to be considered to identify the nature of the new physics phenomena . because the number of ( tree - level ) feynman diagrams contributing to the scattering amplitude is growing rapidly with the number of external particles ( it can be shown , that this growth is _ factorial _ in an unflavored @xmath2 theory @xcite )",
    ", it is necessary to perform completely automatized numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "an important example is given by the study of the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking . assuming",
    "a higgs boson is found in future experiments , determining its properties like the form of the self interaction and the yukawa couplings will require the study of processes with many fermions in the final state .",
    "in we show the number of diagrams contributing to associated top - higgs production that can be used to measure the top - quark yukawa coupling .",
    ".associated top - higgs production [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we next turn to the case of a weinberg angle different from the on - shell value .",
    "the numerical results in show the behavior expected from the discussion in .",
    "wee see that the 4 point ward identities are violated for the @xmath3 amplitudes and the @xmath4 amplitude with 2 contractions .",
    "the violations of the 4 point ward identities cause errors in the scattering amplitudes starting from the 5 point functions .",
    "this is indeed what happens , however in the examples considered , the numerical effects are small for realistic processes .    as we have seen in",
    ", the modification of the @xmath5 feynman rules can save the ward identity for @xmath6 . from the numerical results obtained with the modification from we find that this is indeed the case and inconsistencies in the amplitudes",
    "can be delayed until 6 point functions are considered .",
    "predictions for scattering processes with a large number of external particles , that will become important at future colliders , make automatized calculations of scattering cross sections indispensable . in",
    "we have reviewed the importance of maintaining gauge invariance in numerical calculations and the need for automatized gauge checks that allow to verify both the consistency of the feynman rules and the numerical stability of the code used in the calculation .",
    "in , we have identified simple , model independent , tools to verify the gauge invariance of the lagrangian used in a numerical calculation .",
    "we found that the ward identities for on shell 4 point amplitudes are sufficient to reconstruct the feynman rules of a spontaneously broken gauge theory , apart from the quartic higgs coupling that requires the use of a 5 point ward identity .",
    "however , the ward identities with several momentum contractions have to be used to reconstruct the goldstone boson couplings .",
    "the connection between the ward identities for green s functions and the stis for irreducible vertices  that are known to be sufficient for the reconstruction of the feynman rules  has been clarified in . in the analysis",
    ", we have used new identities for vertex functions with several momentum contractions that we have derived in .",
    "additional work is required to determine a minimal set of identities to verify the supersymmetry of susy particle physics models , building on the results of @xcite .",
    "the identities necessary for the gauge checks have been implemented in the matrix element generator omega , as described in and have been used in debugging the implementation of the complete feynman rules of the standard model in @xmath0 gauge .",
    "the infrastructure for the implementation of stis for off shell amplitudes that are relevant for checks of supersymmetry @xcite and in loop calculations @xcite has also been provided .",
    "in we have given a new proof for the formalism of flips @xcite for the determination of gauge invariant subsets of feynman diagrams ( groves ) .",
    "our proof clarifies the precise definition of gauge flips in spontaneously broken gauge theories that has been applied to the classification of the gauge invariance classes in .",
    "we found new gauge invariance classes in theories with a nonlinearly realized scalar sector . in this case the groves in theories with only neutral higgs bosons can be classified according to the number of internal higgs boson lines .",
    "these results are also relevant for calculations in unitarity gauge . in theories with a linear realized scalar sector in @xmath0 gauge , no additional groves compared to the unbroken case exist .",
    "the applications of gauge flips to loop diagrams is currently being studied @xcite and the extension of our proof of to loop diagrams , using the feynman tree theorem @xcite in the formulation of @xcite , is under investigation .    in realistic calculations , the need to include finite width effects and the introduction of running coupling constants violates gauge invariance .",
    "in we have reviewed schemes that have been proposed to treat unstable gauge bosons in effective tree level calculations and that we have implemented in omega .",
    "we have investigated these schemes numerically in the single @xmath7 production process @xmath1 , both at the matrixelement and at the cross section level .",
    "we have obtained results consistent with existing literature and find that the fixed width @xcite and the complex mass scheme @xcite give consistent results while the timelike and the running width scheme @xcite are unreliable at large energies .",
    "we can also confirm problems of the nonlocal vertex scheme @xcite with unitarity that recently have been reported in @xcite .",
    "results for 6 fermion production processes and comparison with @xcite will be given in future work .",
    "problems with gauge invariance arise also from an inconsistent introduction of running coupling constants .",
    "we have discussed this issue in for the example of the weinberg angle in the standard model , using the constraints from the ward identities obtained in .",
    "we find that discrepancies between unitarity and @xmath0 gauge at the per cent level can arise from a inconsistent use of the weinberg angle in the triple couplings involving goldstone bosons and in the neutral current couplings .",
    "the inconsistencies can be reduced in the considered examples if an on - shell value of the weinberg angle is used in the goldstone boson couplings and in the higgs - z couplings .",

    "in this appendix we briefly sketch the formalism of brs invariance @xcite and set up our notation .",
    "the general formalism is reviewed in , the application to the spontaneously broken gauge theory introduced in is given in .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in standard textbooks @xcite . in",
    "we introduce our graphical notation for brs transformations and stis .",
    "the brs transformations are generated by a fermionic , hermitian operator @xmath8 , the brs charge .",
    "we write the transformations of a general field @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a grassmann number .",
    "the brs transformations are chosen so the brs - charge is _ nilpotent _ : @xmath12 this is a crucial property that allows to decompose the hilbert space of the theory into physical and unphysical states and to define brs invariant gauge fixing terms as we will see below . in gauge theories the brs transformation of physical fields",
    "is obtained by replacing the gauge - transformation parameter by the product between @xmath11 and a ghost field .",
    "the transformation of the ghost is chosen in an appropriate way to make the brs transformation nilpotent .    because of the nilpotency of @xmath8 ,",
    "states that are obtained by applying @xmath8 to another arbitrary state ( so called ` brs exact states ' ) have vanishing norm : @xmath13 states that are annihilated by the brs charge are called ` brs closed ' .",
    "they are orthogonal to the exact states : @xmath14 therefore we can decompose the hilbert space into orthogonal subspaces . because of the nilpotency of @xmath8 , a closed state stays closed if one adds an arbitrary exact state .",
    "one can show ( see e.g. @xcite ) that provided the brs closed states have positive norm , it is consistent to define the _ physical _ states of the theory as closed states modulo exact states : @xmath15 in mathematical terms , this is the _ cohomology _ of the operator @xmath8 .",
    "we will see in that in a spontaneously broken gauge theory this condition eliminates the unphysical components of the gauge fields , the goldstone bosons and the ghosts from the spectrum .",
    "gauge fixing of the lagrangian can be performed by adding the brs transformation of an _ arbitrary _ functional @xmath16 of the fields with ghost number @xmath17 to the classical lagrangian @xmath18 @xmath19 this construction ensures that matrix elements between physical states are independent of the gauge fixing : @xmath20 we can derive the general _",

    "for the higgs and goldstone bosons the explicit transformation laws in the parametrization are given by @xmath25 we will see that the inhomogeneous term @xmath26 in the transformation of the goldstone bosons ensures that they are not part of the physical spectrum .",
    "the brs transformations of asymptotic fields receive only contributions from the terms in linear in the fields @xcite .",
    "therefore the only asymptotic fields transforming nontrivially are : @xmath27 according to the definition of physical states given in , the physical spectrum consists only of fermions , physical scalars and three components of the gauge bosons .",
    "the scalar mode of the gauge bosons with polarization @xmath28 , the goldstone bosons and the antighost are eliminated from the physical spectrum because they are not annihilated by q while the ghost fields and the auxiliary field @xmath29 are zero - norm states in the image of @xmath8 .    to perform gauge fixing",
    ", we have to chose a gauge fixing functional @xmath30 $ ] in .",
    "the faddeev - popov lagrangian @xcite , originally derived from the path integral , is reproduced by the choice @xmath31 that results in the lagrangian    [ eq : gauge - fix ] @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34    the explicit form of the gauge fixing function is given in a linear @xmath0-gauge by @xmath35 the equation of motion for the auxiliary field @xmath29 resulting from @xmath36 allows to write the gauge fixing lagrangian as @xmath37 using the parametrization we find @xmath38 so , after an integration by parts , the ghost lagrangian becomes @xmath39 and the feynman rules for the ghosts are given by    [ subeq : ghost - fr ] @xmath40    the propagators resulting from are    @xmath41      to represent stis diagrammatically , we will introduce the following graphical notation for the homogeneous part of the brs - transformations of the fields : @xmath42 the contraction with a momentum is denoted by a black square .",
    "therefore the brs transformation of a gauge boson looks like @xmath43 the multiplication with a gauge boson mass will be denoted by a cross so the transformation of a goldstone boson is written as @xmath44    because of the nonlinearity of the brs transformations , these transformations receive radiative corrections .",
    "the insertion of a brs transformed gauge field in a green s function therefore is represented as    @xmath45    the second term consists of the tree level contribution from plus loop corrections .",
    "the tree level contribution is a disconnected diagram , therefore we denote the green s functions with insertions of brs - transformed fields by diamond - shaped blobs to distinguish them from connected green s functions . in the above example , the tree level diagram and a one loop contribution look like :    @xmath46    for tree level applications it is sufficient to keep only the first term .",
    "the nakanishi - lautrup field is represented by a double line .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath47 for the insertion of the auxiliary field @xmath29 into green s functions .",
    "the bilinear feynman rules for the coupling to gauge- and goldstone bosons follow from the equation of motion : @xmath48    as an example for the graphical representation of a sti , we consider the sti for the @xmath49 vertex : @xmath50 beginning with the 4 point functions , the structure of the ` contact terms ' with the insertion of the operator @xmath51 gets more complicated , since the interactions of the ghosts with gauge , higgs and goldstone bosons from the lagrangian have to be taken into account even on tree level ( see in ) .",
    "in we review the theory of nonlinear realizations of symmetries that is useful for constructing effective field theory descriptions of spontaneously broken symmetries . in",
    "we derive the stis relevant for the application to gauge flips for nonlinear realized scalar sectors in .",
    "we will sketch the formalism of nonlinear realized symmetries @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "a description of the formalism in the language of differential geometry is given in @xcite .",
    "we consider a symmetry group @xmath52 that is spontaneously broken down to a subgroup @xmath53 .",
    "keeping the index convention introduced in , we denote the generators of @xmath52 by @xmath54 , the generators of @xmath53 by @xmath55 and the the generators that are not in @xmath53 as @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath53 is a subgroup of @xmath52 , the unbroken generators must form an subalgebra :    @xmath57=f^{abc}l^c\\ ] ]    this shows that the structure constants with one unbroken index vanish .",
    "this implies that the broken generators carry a representation of the unbroken subalgebra : @xmath58= f^{a\\beta\\gamma}v^\\gamma\\ ] ] in general we must assume @xmath59= f^{\\alpha\\beta c}l^c+{\\mathrm{i}}f^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}v^\\gamma\\ ] ]    while for chiral symmetries the commutator of @xmath60s is only a linear combination of @xmath61s .    according to goldstone s theorem , for every broken generator @xmath56 there is a goldstone boson @xmath62 .",
    "the goldstone bosons can be used to parametrize the coset space @xmath63 by introducing the so called canonical representation @xmath64 one can show , that the @xmath65 transform nonlinearly under @xmath52 but linearly under @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the transformation of the @xmath65 is defined as is defined as follows : multiplication of @xmath66 by an arbitrary group element @xmath67 results in another element of @xmath52 that can be written as : @xmath68 here the result of the transformation has been written as the product of an element of the coset space in the canonical representation and a ` compensating ' @xmath53 transformation @xmath69 .",
    "the nonlinear transformations of @xmath65 are defined as @xmath70 we will now introduce matter fields @xmath71 , carrying a representation of the unbroken subgroup @xmath53 . we can lift this representation to a nonlinear realization of @xmath52 by introducing the transformation @xmath72 @xmath52 transformations are realized on the fields @xmath9 as linear , @xmath65 dependent transformations of the unbroken subgroup @xmath53 . to see this , we act with @xmath73 on the original field @xmath71 and insert the definition of @xmath9 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are defined as in",
    ". therefore we can take the transformed field as @xmath77    because of the field dependent transformations , the derivatives of @xmath66 and @xmath9 have no simple transformation law : @xmath78 and one has to construct covariant derivatives to write down kinetic terms for the fields .    the object @xmath79 transforms according to @xmath80 where @xmath81 is made out of the @xmath82 .",

    "it is instructive to check the rather general arguments given in in a more concrete way using the stis .",
    "we will discuss the toy model of an spontaneously broken abelian gauge theory first .",
    "we start with a complex scalar field in a linear parametrization : @xmath91 that transforms under brs transformations according to @xmath92 the cubic interaction terms with the gauge boson arising from the square of the covariant derivative @xmath93 and the potential @xmath94 are given by @xmath95 where we have used @xmath96 and @xmath97    to obtain the nonlinear realization , now we parameterize the scalar fields as @xmath98 in accordance with the general theory , the reparametriezd higgs bosons transform trivial under the symmetry and the goldstone boson transforms inhomogeneously : @xmath99 because of this ` shift symmetry ' , only derivatives of @xmath65 can enter the lagrangian and indeed , from the square of the covariant derivative we find this time @xmath100    we will now discuss the sti for the @xmath101 vertex that is relevant for the definition of the gauge flips in spontaneously broken gauge theories as we have seen in . in the case of the nonlinear realization ,",
    "the sti is simply @xmath102 since the transformations are trivial .",
    "note that in the nonlinear parametrization the higgs boson decouples from the ghosts so no ghost term appears in . from the feynman rules we can verify this identity : @xmath103 where the factor @xmath104 in the last line is a symmetry factor .",
    "therefore , a ward identity like identity is valid also for off shell higgs and goldstone bosons .",
    "this ensures that the diagram @xmath105 satisfies the ward identity by itself .",
    "this is in contrast to the linearly realized symmetry that transforms the higgs and goldstone bosons into one another . in this case",
    "we have a nontrivial sti : @xmath106 indeed , inserting the feynman rules gives @xmath107\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]      for the derivation of the brs transformations in theories with nonlinear symmetries @xcite , we consider the transformations and for infinitesimal parameters @xmath108 . in linear order of @xmath11",
    "we can write @xmath109 in the language of differential geometry , the quantities @xmath110 are killing vector fields , since they generate isometries in the coset space @xmath63 .",
    "the object @xmath111 is known as @xmath53-compensator @xcite .",
    "the brs transformations are now given by @xmath112 we will still use the linear gauge fixing instead of a gauge fixing function in terms of the @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "note that the gauge fixing term in the nonlinear parametrization contains no higgs - ghost interaction since the higgs do nt appear in the brs transformation of the goldstone bosons .",
    "the stis for green s functions depend nonlinear on the gbs through the killing vectors and compensators , e.g. @xmath113 diagrammatically , this can be written as @xmath114    we now turn to the sti for the @xmath101 vertex that is relevant for the discussion of gauge flips . expanding the killing vectors and compensators according to @xmath115",
    "we find that the sti for the @xmath116 vertex is given by : @xmath117 on tree level , the right hand side vanishes because there is no higgs - goldstone boson mixing on tree level",
    ". therefore the same simplification as in the abelian model takes place and we can conclude that the diagram satisfies the ward identity by itself also in the nonabelian case . in higher orders perturbation theory the right hand side of no longer vanishes since a @xmath118 mixing is generated by loop diagrams .",
    "no simplification compared to the linear case appears for the sti for the @xmath119 vertex that is on tree level @xmath120 this identity is similar to the linear case .",
    "in this appendix we discuss some technicalities concerning the stis . in , we review the amputation of contracted gauge boson lines and the ghost terms for external gauge bosons . in",
    "we clarify the correct use of the stis in unitarity gauge and derive the form of the ghost interactions .",
    "contains more details on the derivation of the sti with two contractions in .",
    "finally , collects explicit results for the stis in the model of that will be used in the calculations of ward identities .",
    "we define amputated green s functions as a continuation of the @xmath121-matrix elements off the mass shell : @xmath122 if all external particles are on - shell , this becomes the lsz formula ( for this formulation see e.g. @xcite ) .    using the convention to treat the operators @xmath123 as insertions that are not amputated ,",
    "the contact terms on the right hand side of are turned into ( for simplicity we treat all momenta as incoming ) @xmath124    the amputation of fermions must be discussed a little more carefully since we have to distinguish particles and antiparticles . the corresponding lsz formula are @xcite : @xmath125 therefore an amputated green s function with the insertion of the brs transformation of a fermion becomes @xmath126 this can be regarded as the prescription to compute the matrix element with the ` polarization spinor ' @xmath127 for the transformed particle @xmath128 .",
    "similar considerations apply for the remaining cases in so we have to apply the replacements @xmath129 for the calculations of contact terms involving fermions .      to go in the sti from green s functions to amputated matrix elements , one has to amputate external gauge boson lines contracted with a momentum .",
    "this can be done using the ( tree level ) relations @xmath130 on tree level they can be checked from the explicit expressions , but we will sketch the derivation from the stis that allows the generalization to loop calculations@xcite .    is a consequence of the sti ( see ) @xmath131 that becomes on tree level @xmath132 in momentum space , this becomes the desired relation .",
    "@xmath133    similarly one can use the sti @xmath134 to show the equivalence of the ghost and goldstone boson propagators on tree level .",
    "the radiative corrections to this simple relations are discussed e.g. in @xcite .      in a spontaneously broken gauge theory in @xmath0 gauge , the ward identity is given by @xmath135 to obtain a relation for scattering amplitudes , we amputate the gauge boson according to the lsz formula , we obtain for an incoming @xmath7 @xmath136 for an outgoing gauge boson the sign has to be changed . on tree level , the relation can be used to eliminate the gauge parameter @xmath137 and the propagators from so we obtain the identity : @xmath138 on loop level , there are correction factors @xcite that can be computed from the stis and .      in the sti with external off - shell gauge bosons ,",
    "there appear additional ghost terms of the form @xmath139 the ghost terms have the same pole structure as the left hand side of the sti so no inverse propagators appear when going to amputated green s functions . to perform the amputation",
    ", we write the right hand side of as @xmath140 the derivation of the sti for amputated green s functions involves the multiplication with the inverse gauge boson propagator @xmath141 . in the first term",
    "this cancels the ghost propagator because of : @xmath142 therefore the amputated version of is @xmath143      in unitarity gauge the goldstone bosons and ghosts decouple from the physical matrix elements , however , on the quantum level there is an additional , divergent term in the lagrangian of the form @xmath144 this form is valid for a single higgs , we will not need the general expression in this work .",
    "different derivations of this result are reviewed in @xcite .    instead of eliminating the ghosts from the theory and using the nonpolynomial higgs interaction",
    ", one can also introduce ghost fields even in unitarity gauge . in an abelian spontaneously broken gauge theory the appropriate lagrangian is found to be @xmath145 this results in a ghost ` propagator ' @xmath146 and a ghost - higgs vertex @xmath147 it can be shown @xcite that the resummation of ghosts loops calculated using this lagrangian leads back to .",
    "we will now show that the sti is valid also in unitarity gauge if we include in addition to the ghost lagrangian also a goldstone boson ghost interaction .",
    "we define unitarity gauge by taking the limit @xmath148 _ after _ amputating the external propagators . in this way",
    "all _ internal _ goldstone bosons are removed from the theory but the ward identity remains valid .",
    "we show that also the stis remain valid , if the higgs - ghost coupling and a similar goldstone boson - ghost coupling are used .    as the simplest example , consider a 4 point contact term similar to but with a external higgs boson : @xmath149 since the ghosts are amputated _ before _",
    "sending @xmath148 , the first term remains unchanged . in the second term",
    ", we have to consider the ghost - higgs coupling that we write schematically as ] @xmath150 then we obtain for the combination of the ghost - higgs vertex and the ghost propagator @xmath151 this is just the same result as the one from the lagrangian .",
    "similarly , we obtain for a ghost line , coupled to @xmath152 higgs bosons : @xmath153,i[j ] } \\fmf{phantom}{i[j],t[j+1 ] } \\fmfdot{i[j ] } \\end{fmffor } \\fmfdot{r } \\end{fmfchar*}}\\quad\\xrightarrow{\\xi\\to\\infty}\\quad\\left(\\frac{-{\\mathrm{i}}}{m_w}\\right)^n(-{\\mathrm{i}}g)^n\\ ] ]    we now consider ghost lines with insertions of gauge bosons . in a linear @xmath0 gauge the ghost - gauge boson vertex is independent of @xmath137 .",
    "therefore a ghost line that includes at least one interaction with a gauge boson drops out if we go to unitarity gauge : @xmath154,i[j ] } \\fmf{phantom}{i[j],t[j+1 ] } \\fmfdot{i[j ] } \\end{fmffor } \\fmfdot{r , i4 } \\end{fmfchar*}}\\quad\\xrightarrow{\\xi\\to\\infty}\\quad 0\\ ] ] thus , the ghosts decouple from the gauge bosons as expected .    if we consider a ghost line with insertions of goldstone and higgs bosons , the argument leading to remains valid .",
    "in contrast to the case of higgs bosons , the contributions of _ internal _ goldstone bosons vanish in the limit @xmath148 because of the @xmath137 dependence of the propagators . however , external goldstone bosons must be kept , and we have to include the ghost - goldstone boson vertices in addition to .    from we see that we can obtain the ghost vertices in unitarity gauge from those in @xmath0 gauge : @xmath155 the expression for these couplings in a nonabelian spontaneously broken gauge theory is given in .",
    "therefore the ghost lagrangian , to be used in calculations of stis in unitarity gauge , is @xmath156 here the ghost couplings on the right hand side are those in unitarity gauge .",
    "we have shown that the ghost lagrangian reproduces the contact terms in the limit @xmath148 , provided we amputate the ghost propagators before taking the limit .    we still have to consider the term @xmath157 that appears in the sti for green s functions with off - shell gauge bosons .",
    "the only contributions to this matrix element again include a ghost line with @xmath152 insertions of higgs bosons , this time with one missing ghost propagator compared to .",
