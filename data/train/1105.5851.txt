    "primordial non - gaussianity has been attracting attention as a powerful probe to discriminate many existing inflation models ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "statistics of zero - mean gaussian fluctuations can be characterized by a variance which corresponds to two - point function .",
    "hence , the non - gaussianity of fluctuations can be linked to the higher - order correlation functions .",
    "a lot of studies have been done for the bispectrum , i.e. three - point function of the primordial perturbations .",
    "for the so - called local type perturbation , the bispectrum is completely characterized by a single non - linearity parameter @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the current bound on @xmath2 is @xmath3 at @xmath4 confidence level  @xcite .    in the last few years",
    ", trispectrum is becoming an important observable as well .",
    "for the local type non - gaussianity , the trispectrum is specified by two non - linearity parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the current bounds on @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively @xmath7 and @xmath8 at @xmath4 confidence level  @xcite . an interesting fact that boosts the importance of the study of the trispectrum",
    "is that @xmath5 has a minimum determined by @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath9 it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that planck satellite can measure @xmath5 down to @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , future detection of @xmath11 which is the central value of the current bound implies that we should also detect non - vanishing @xmath5 .",
    "detection of both @xmath2 and @xmath5 ( and possibly @xmath6 as well ) enables us to constrain or even pin down the inflation model and the origin of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "in fact , in ref .  @xcite the authors have discussed an observational constraint on the ratio between @xmath2 and @xmath5 which is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "there exist a few studies that extend the inequality ( [ ft ] ) .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite considered one - loop corrections to ( [ ft ] ) and found the one - loop effect appears as the scale dependent modification of the coefficient in front of @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have discussed that how many parameters one needs in order to characterize higher order correlation functions of primordial curvature fluctuations and also introduced the non - linearity parameters for the five - point function .",
    "the non - linearity parameters up to the six - point function were introduced in @xcite and two inequalities between the six- and four - point function were derived @xcite . a potential importance and usefulness of the higher order correlation functions motivate us to look for the similar inequalities like ( [ ft ] ) for the higher order correlation functions . in this paper , we provide a general formalism to construct the inequalities among the non - linearity parameters for the higher order correlation functions . to this end , we will adopt the diagrammatic approach developed in refs .",
    "@xcite that turns out to be a convenient way to study the higher order correlation functions . by using this method , in principle",
    ", we can systematically derive all the inequalities up to any - point function .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly review the higher order correlation functions of primordial curvature fluctuations , based on @xmath14 formalism and the diagrammatic approach . in section  [ sec : inequality ] , we define the non - linearity parameters to characterize the higher order functions and construct the series of inequalities by applying the cauchy - schwarz inequality . we also present all inequalities up to the six- and eight - point functions .",
    "section  [ sec : con ] is spent on the conclusion of this paper .",
    "according to the @xmath14 formalism @xcite , the curvature perturbation on the uniform energy density hypersurface on super - horizon scales at @xmath15 is equal to the perturbation of the e - folding number evaluated from the flat hypersurface at @xmath16 to the uniform energy density hypersurface at @xmath17 at the same point : @xmath18 the initial time @xmath19 can be chosen arbitrary . if we chose @xmath19 as the time slightly after the scale we are interested in leaves the hubble horizon during inflation , then @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ deltan1 ] ) is sourced by the scalar field fluctuations .",
    "thus , @xmath20 can be taylor - expanded in terms of the scalar field fluctuations as @xmath21 where @xmath22 run from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( @xmath24 is a number of light scalar fields that acquire super - horizon scale fluctuations during inflation ) . in the following , we assume that @xmath25 are gaussian variables .    the two - point function of @xmath20 can be written as @xmath26 to leading order in the field fluctuations , @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where summation over @xmath29 is assumed .",
    "the three - point function of @xmath20 can be written as @xmath30 to leading order in the field fluctuations , @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 following literatures , the constant coefficient in front of the square of the power spectrum is written as @xcite @xmath33    the four - point function of @xmath20 can be written as @xmath34 to leading order in the field fluctuations , @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "note that there appear two distinct terms that exhibit different wavenumber dependence . as a consequence ,",
    "we need two parameters to specify the tri - spectrum .",
    "following literatures , the two constant parameters are defined by @xcite @xmath38    we can further proceed to higher order correlation functions as follows .",
    "the leading order of the @xmath39-point function is given by a sum of several distinct terms which are products of @xmath40 power spectra and exhibit different wavenumber dependence .",
    "according to the diagrammatic method  @xcite , each of these leading terms has a corresponding connected tree diagram that consists of @xmath39 vertices and @xmath40 lines connecting two vertices .",
    "tree diagrams for the two- ,  three- and four - point functions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram_2.eps ] . in reverse , given a tree diagram with @xmath39 vertices , we can reconstruct the corresponding term that constitutes the @xmath39-point function as follows .",
    "first , we assign a different wavenumber @xmath41 to each vertex of the diagram , where @xmath41 are the arguments of the @xmath39-point function with the constraint @xmath42 .",
    "next , we assign a wavenumber to each line in the diagram , too .",
    "removing a line from the diagram yields two respectively connected sub - diagrams .",
    "then , one assigns to the removed line the sum of the vectors associated with all vertices in one of the two sub - diagrams . any use of the two sub - diagrams yields the same answer because of the constraint @xmath42 . after associating the wavenumbers with all lines",
    ", we can assign the corresponding factors to the vertices and the lines . as for",
    "the vertex with p lines attached , assign the factor @xmath43 to it . as for the lines ,",
    "assign @xmath44 , where the argument of @xmath44 is set to the length of the wavenumber associated with each line . by multiplying all these factors assigned to vertices and lines ,",
    "we obtain the corresponding leading term . any term constructed in this way",
    "is given by a product of two terms .",
    "one is the constant term which is given by contracting all the pairs of indices of the expansion coefficients assigned to each vertex of the tree diagram .",
    "the other term is the @xmath40 product of the power spectra of the scalar field plus its permutations .",
    "if we replace each power spectrum of the scalar fields by that of the curvature perturbation , i.e. @xmath45 , the constant part gets a factor @xmath46 in the denominator . following the cases for the bispectrum and the trispectrum",
    ", we define the constant parameter corresponding to this diagram as a coefficient in front of the @xmath40 product of @xmath47 . by taking the sum over",
    "all the possible ( connected ) tree diagrams with @xmath39 vertices , we obtain the @xmath39-point function .     formalism .",
    "we find that we need two parameters in order to characterize the trispectrum . ]",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the functions constructed from two tree diagrams that are not isomorphic each other always yield different wavenumber dependence .",

    "@xcite . according to refs .",

    "( [ eqfort ] ) , we can recursively obtain @xmath48 as well .",
    "for example , @xmath54 .",
    "as we mentioned in the last section , wavenumber dependence of the @xmath39-point function is completely specified by a set of constant parameters each of which has a corresponding connected tree diagram with @xmath39 vertices . for the purpose of constructing the general inequalities among the non - linearity parameters ,",
    "it is convenient to adopt a normalization condition , @xmath55 without a loss of generality , this condition can be always imposed by rescaling the scalar field fluctuation . with this condition ,",
    "the denominator of the non - linearity parameters for the @xmath39-point function , which is given by @xmath46 , becomes unity .      for any connected tree diagram with @xmath39 vertices ,",
    "if we cut a line appearing in the diagram , the diagram splits into two sub - diagrams .",
    "if the resulting two sub - diagrams are isomorphic to each other , we call the parent diagram symmetric diagram . obviously , in order for a diagram to be a symmetric diagram , @xmath39 must be even .",
    "let us denote by @xmath56 a number of all the symmetric diagrams among @xmath57 tree diagrams with @xmath58 vertices .",
    "for example , @xmath59 .",
    "our aim is to construct the inequalities of the cauchy - schwarz type for the non - linearity parameters up to the @xmath39-point functions .",
    "as it will be clear later , this is possible when @xmath39 is even . for the case of odd @xmath39",
    ", we can not construct the inequalities .",
    "for example , there are inequalities among the non - linearity parameters up to the six - point function .",
    "but there are no inequalities in which the highest order of the non - linearity parameters is five .    since whether @xmath39 is",
    "even or odd is important , let us first write the non - linearity parameters for the @xmath58-point function as @xmath60 here , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the non - linearity parameters for the symmetric diagram and the non - symmetric diagram , respectively .     cases . ]    in fig .",

    "we can construct the series of inequalities in a following way .",
    "since @xmath61 is a non - linearity parameter corresponding to the symmetric diagram , it can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a vector associated with a diagram @xmath75 which is one of the sub - diagrams generated by dividing the symmetric diagram into two diagrams that are isomorphic to each other . therefore , @xmath75 is a tree diagram with @xmath76 vertices and with one external line .",
    "next , let us consider a quantity @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",
    "this must be a non - linearity parameter whose corresponding diagram is a diagram with @xmath58 vertices and is given by connecting the external line of @xmath75 with that of @xmath79 . since this diagram is a non - symmetric diagram , there exists some @xmath80 such that @xmath81 applying the cauchy - schwarz inequality to eqs .",
    "( [ highest1 ] ) and ( [ highest2 ] ) yields an inequality , @xmath82 a number of the independent inequalities of this kind is @xmath83 .",

    "let us then lower the order by one and consider a quantity , @xmath85 this is a non - linearity parameter whose corresponding diagram is obtained by connecting the external line of @xmath75 with that of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , there exists some @xmath80 such that @xmath87 meanwhile , since a quantity @xmath88 is a non - linearity parameter whose corresponding diagram is obtained by connecting the external lines of the same two @xmath86 , we have @xmath89 applying again the cauchy - schwarz inequality to eqs .",
    "( [ nhighest1 ] ) and ( [ nhighest2 ] ) yields @xmath90 a number of the independent inequalities of this kind is @xmath91 .",
    "these are the inequalities among the non - linearity parameters for @xmath92 and @xmath93-point functions .      let us further lower the order by one and consider a quantity @xmath94 this is a non - linearity parameter",
    "whose corresponding diagram is obtained by connecting the external line of @xmath75 with that of @xmath95 .",
    "since this diagram can be both symmetric or non - symmetric , we write it as @xmath96 applying the same reasoning as before , we obtain @xmath97 a number of the independent inequalities of this kind is @xmath98 .",
    "these are the inequalities among the non - linearity parameters for @xmath99 and @xmath100-point functions .    by repeating the above procedures until the order reduces to one ,",
    "we can obtain all the cauchy - schwarz type inequalities that involve the non - linearity parameters for the @xmath58-point function as the highest order .",
    "in particular , at the final procedure , we end up with getting a set of inequalities : @xmath101 a number of the independent inequalities of this kind is @xmath56 .    combining all these results ,",
    "a number @xmath102 of independent inequalities that involve the non - linearity parameters for the @xmath58-point function as the highest order is given by @xmath103 for example , @xmath104 .",
    "there are two different tree diagrams for the four - point function .",

    "the primordial non - gaussianity has been focused on by many authors as a new probe of the inflation dynamics .",
    "in addition to the bispectrum , use of the higher order correlation functions will become useful in the future .",
