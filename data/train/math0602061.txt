    "digraphs frequently serve to model processes that can proceed in the direction of arcs . physical transference , service , control , transmission of influences , ideas , innovations , and diseases are examples of such processes .",
    "if a process can start from a number of vertices and ends with the inclusion of all vertices , then the process can be modelled by the family of out forests ( i.e. , spanning diverging forests ) of the digraph .",
    "the enumeration of all out forests allows one to determine the typical roles of the vertices in the process : one vertex is a typical starting point , another vertex is a typical intermediate point , some vertex is a typical terminating point of the process , etc . if an initial ( weighted )",
    "digraph imposes some measure on the said processes , then the `` role profile '' of each vertex can be expressed numerically .",
    "moreover , an exact answer can be given to the following important question : how likely is it that the process initiated at vertex @xmath0 arrives at vertex  @xmath1 .",
    "it is not surprising that out forests of a digraph turn out to be closely related with markov chains realizable on the digraph .",
    "the study of out forests has been started in  @xcite . generally , they were given less attention in the literature , than that given to spanning diverging trees ( out arborescences ) , which exist only for a narrow class of digraphs .",

    "the maximum out forests ( i.e. , out forests with the greatest possible number of arcs ) of a digraph were studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was established that the normalized matrix of such forests coincides with the matrix of limiting probabilities of every markov chain _ related _ to the given digraph .",
    "some results on spanning forests of directed and undirected multigraphs were given in  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the normalized matrix of out forests ( which has been also termed the matrix of relative forest accessibilities and the matrix of forest proximities ) and the matrices of forests with fixed numbers of arcs .",
