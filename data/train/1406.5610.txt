    "it should be emphasized that the longitudinal and transverse pressures in eqs .",

    "in particular , one can see that the magnetic energy density term @xmath81 contributes oppositely to the longitudinal and transverse pressures under a constant magnetic field , and it decreases the former while increases the latter , which will lead to a tremendous difference between the longitudinal and transverse pressure when the magnetic field is very strong .",
    "it is generally believed that the magnetic field strength in the core of compact stars should be much larger than that at the surface , and a density - dependent magnetic field profile is usually introduced to describe this behavior for the spatial distribution of the magnetic field strength in the compact stars  @xcite . in the present work , we use the following popular parametrization for the density - dependent magnetic field profile in qss  @xcite @xmath104 , \\label{brhoeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the magnetic field strength at the surface of compact stars and its value is fixed at @xmath106 g in this work , @xmath107 @xmath57 is the normal nuclear matter density , @xmath108 is a parameter with dimension of @xmath60 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are two dimensionless parameters that control how exactly the magnetic field strength decays from the center to the surface .",
    "besides the spatial distribution of the magnetic field strength in the compact stars , the orientation of the magnetic fields is also expected to be important for the structure of the compact stars since the pressure ( including the contribution from the magnetic fields ) may become significantly anisotropic under strong magnetic fields .",
    "consequently , the gravitational field in magnetized stars is no longer spherically symmetric due to the pressure anisotropy and the well - known tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations  @xcite generally can not be applied to calculate the structure of the magnetized compact stars since they are only valid for spherically symmetric compact stars .",
    "since there is no empirical information on the magnetic field orientation inside the compact stars , in the present work , we assume two extremely special cases for the orientation of the magnetic fields inside the compact stars : one is that the local magnetic fields are along the radial direction ( denoted as `` radial orientation '' ) , and the other is that the local magnetic fields are perpendicular to the radial direction but randomly oriented in the plane perpendicular to the radial direction ( denoted as `` transverse orientation '' ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that the magnetic fields pass through the centra of the spherical compact stars for the radial orientation . in these two extreme cases ,",
    "the pressure distribution inside the static compact stars can be considered to be spherically symmetric and thus the gravitational field as well as the static compact stars are spherically symmetric too .",
    "for these two extreme cases for the orientation of the magnetic fields , one thus can calculate the structure of the static magnetized compact stars by solving the following tov equations : @xmath111\\bigg[1+\\frac{4\\pi p(r)r^3}{m(r)}\\bigg]\\times \\notag \\\\ & \\bigg[1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{r}\\bigg]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is the total mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath113 , @xmath114 is the corresponding energy density ( including the magnetic field contribution ) , @xmath115 is the corresponding ( radial ) pressure ( including the magnetic field contribution ) , and @xmath116 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "we would like to point out that the radial and transverse orientations have been assumed to be inside the compact stars and the magnetic field orientation outside the compact stars or close the surface of the compact stars may change and become nonspherically symmetric . on the other hand , it should be mentioned that around the surface of compact stars , the magnetic field strength relatively is quite weak ( @xmath117 g ) and the pressure is very small , and thus the magnetic fields around the surface is not important for the structure of qss . for more general cases of magnetic field orientations and/or distributions in the magnetized compact stars where the spherical symmetry is broken ,",
    "einstein field equations should be solved self - consistently to calculate the structure of the compact stars , and this is beyond the scope of the present work and yet to be constructed .",

    "[ ptlconstb ] decrease correspondingly and even disappear ( e.g. , at @xmath182 ) .",
    "these features imply that our main conclusion about the magnetic field effects on the properties of qss remains unchanged even if various interactions are used .",
    "furthermore , the high density quark matter might be in a color superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "the possible quark color superconducting phases mainly include the two - flavor color superconductor ( 2sc )  @xcite , the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase  @xcite , and the crystalline color superconductor ( ccs )  @xcite . in the present work , for simplicity ,",
    "we have not considered color superconducting phases . in recent years , significant progress has been made to understand the magnetic field effects on the properties of quark color superconducting phases  @xcite .",
    "in particular , by modeling the quark confinement within an effective bag model , the eos of the magnetic - color - flavor - locked ( mcfl ) phase and the corresponding qs structure under a constant magnetic field have been investigated in ref .",
    "it is nice to see that the magnetic field effects on the pressure anisotropy and the qs mass obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite are quite similar with our present predictions based on the density dependent magnetic field strength in the ciddm model .",
    "it will be interesting to see how exactly the quark color superconducting phases affect the properties of sqm and qss under strong magnetic fields within the ciddm model .",
    "we have studied the properties of strange quark matter and quark stars under strong magnetic fields by using the confined isospin- and density - dependent mass model .",
    "the equation of state of strange quark matter under constant magnetic fields has been calculated self - consistently and the pressure of the system is shown to be anisotropic along and perpendicular to the magnetic field direction with the former being generally larger than the latter .",
    "the pressure of the system may become significantly anisotropic when the magnetic field strength is very strong and thus the properties of magnetized quark stars may significantly depend on the magnetic field orientation inside the stars .    using a density - dependent magnetic field profile to simulate the magnetic field strength distribution in a star ,",
    "we have studied the properties of static spherical quark stars by considering two hypothetical cases for the orientation of the magnetic fields inside the stars , i.e. , the radial orientation in which the local magnetic fields are along the radial direction and the transverse orientation in which the local magnetic fields are perpendicular to the radial direction but randomly oriented in the plane perpendicular to the radial direction .",
    "based on these two extreme cases of the magnetic field orientation , we have demonstrated that the maximum mass of static magnetized quark stars may significantly depend on the magnetic field orientation inside the stars , and the magnetic fields with radial ( transverse ) orientation can significantly decrease ( increase ) the maximum mass of the quark stars .",
    "the maximum mass of static magnetized quark stars has also been found to depend on the details of the density - dependent magnetic field profile .",
    "therefore , our present results have shown that besides the strength distribution , the orientation of the magnetic fields inside the quark stars is also important for the properties of quark stars under strong magnetic fields . for a fixed density - dependent magnetic field profile , including the magnetic fields can either enhance or reduce the maximum mass of static magnetized quark stars , depending on the magnetic field orientation inside the stars .",
