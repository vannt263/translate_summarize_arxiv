    "trojans are minor bodies that share the semimajor axis of their host body but they may have different eccentricity and inclination . in a frame of reference rotating with the host , they move in the so - called tadpole orbits around the lagrangian equilateral points l@xmath4 and l@xmath5 ; l@xmath4 is located on the orbit of the host object at some 60@xmath9 ahead or east of the host , and l@xmath5 is some 60@xmath9 west . in other words and for a trojan object , the relative mean longitude @xmath10 oscillates around the values + 60@xmath9 ( l@xmath4 ) or -60@xmath9 ( or 300@xmath9 , l@xmath5 ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mean longitudes of the trojan and the host body , respectively . the first trojan object , 588 achilles , was discovered by m. wolf in 1906 at jupiter s l@xmath4 point ( einarsson 1913 ) . since 1990 , mars is second to jupiter in being recognized as the host of a population of trojan minor bodies ( see , for example , marzari et al .",

    "right after the discovery of eureka , it was suggested that mars trojans may have been captured fairly late in solar system history ( bowell et al .",
    "1990 ) but soon after , the primeval mars trojan scenario started to gain support from both dynamical ( long - term integrations ) and spectroscopic data ( mikkola et al .",
    "1994 ; howell et al .",
    "today , it is widely accepted that some mars trojans may be primordial bodies , perhaps the only surviving examples of the planetesimal population that formed in the terrestrial planets region ( e.g. , connors et al . 2005 ; scholl et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "any claim regarding the putative ancient nature of all or part of the current mars trojan populations must be supported by dynamical stability analyses .",
    "the stability of martian trojans was first studied by mikkola & innanen ( 1994 ) . for a simulated time of 100  myr",
    ", they found two regions of stability depending on the orbital inclination , @xmath13 ; only orbits with @xmath14 ( 15 , 30)@xmath9 or @xmath14 ( 32 , 44)@xmath9 appeared to be long - term stable .",
    "tabachnik & evans ( 1999 , 2000 ) found that the inclination ranges in mikkola & innanen ( 1994 ) ensured stability around the lagrangian point l@xmath4 but that around l@xmath5 , the range of stable inclinations was @xmath14 ( 15 , 40)@xmath9 . in their 100  myr simulations , both eureka and 101429 were deeply settled into the l@xmath5 stable region ; they also suggested a primordial origin for these two objects .",
    "focusing on the role of secular resonances in the dynamical evolution of mars trojans , brasser & lehto ( 2002 ) found that several secular resonances with the earth , mars and jupiter were able to explain the unstable inclination ranges found by previous studies .",
    "scholl et al .",
    "( 2005 ) further explored this topic to conclude that secular resonances make trojan orbits with @xmath15 as well as those with @xmath16 unstable .",
    "orbits with @xmath17 are also unstable due to the kozai resonance ( kozai 1962 ) . in their 4.5  gyr calculations , they also found that the dynamical half - life of mars trojans in the most stable regions is of the order of the age of the solar system and that the yarkovsky effect has negligible role for objects larger than about 10  m. all known mars trojans have relatively small sizes with diameters of order of 1  km ( trilling et al .",

    "our calculations consider point , constant mass objects orbiting in a conservative system ; therefore , relativistic effects are ignored and no modeling of the yarkovsky and yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack ( yorp ) effects ( see , e.g. , bottke et al .",

    "we have also calculated the evolution of the previously known mars trojans ( see figs [ known1 ] and [ known2 ] ) .",
    "our orbital integrations use initial conditions ( positions and velocities in the barycentre of the solar system referred to the jd2456200.5 epoch ) provided by jpl s horizons system ( giorgini et al . 1996 ; standish 1998 ) . in all the figures ,",
    "@xmath22 = 0 coincides with the jd2456200.5 epoch .",

    "the sources of the heliocentric keplerian osculating orbital elements and uncertainties are the jpl small - body database and the astdys-2 portal .",
    "the results of these control calculations are consistent with those from the nominal ones . in order to study the long term stability of these newly found trojans we use the regularized mixed variable symplectic ( rmvs ) integrator ( swift - rmvs3 ) which is part of the swift package ( levison & duncan 1994 ) .",
    "the swift package is available from h. levison web site.hal/swift.html ] the physical model here is similar to the previous one but the earth and the moon are replaced by the barycentre of the system .",

    "relative errors in the total energy are now @xmath25 .",
