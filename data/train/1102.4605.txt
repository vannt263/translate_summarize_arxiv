    "_ biophotons _ refer to a certain kind of radiation emitted by virtually all living systems@xcite .",
    "the photons are emitted in the range from the visible to the ultraviolet , say @xmath0 the spectrum of emitted biophotons may be described by the _ spectral distribution _ per unit frequency per unit time per unit area , @xmath1 and with a measured range of _ total _ biophoton radiation rates per unit area @xmath2 the detailed rates depend on the biological sample being measured .",
    "our purpose is to provide evidence that the biophotons are a soft photon radiation signature of hard higher energy nuclear transmutations in biological systems .",
    "biophotons are thereby a potentially useful probe of those biological tissues which exhibit significant nuclear reactions .",
    "the biophoton distribution is surely _ not _ what might be expected from planck thermal radiation @xmath3 the exponentially infinitesimal mean number @xmath4 of thermal photons in the experimental range eq.([intro1 ] ) is far too small at biological temperatures to produce the observed biophoton radiation distribution .",
    "the counting statistics of the observed biophotons are also surely _ not _ what would be expected from a thermal planck - einstein counting distribution . for electromagnetic modes labeled by the index @xmath5 , the thermal planck - einstein photon counting statistics obey @xmath6=\\prod_k\\left[\\frac{1}{1+\\bar{n}_k}\\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}_k}{1+\\bar{n}_k}\\right)^{n_k}\\right ] , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{intro7}\\ ] ] ( iii ) biophotons exhibit time delayed luminescence@xcite .",
    "such delays give rise to a time dependent transition rate with a hyperbolic long time tail ; e.g. @xmath10 plotted in what follows in fig.[fig1 ] and which is inconsistent with simple `` exponentential decay '' emission processes .",
    "eq.([intro8 ] ) will be derived in sec.[tdl ] .",
    "it will be shown in what follows that _ soft _ multi - photon radiation from _ hard _ high energy reaction sources obeying @xmath11 allow for an explanation of all three experimental properties in eq.([intro6 ] ) , ( [ intro7 ] ) and ( [ intro8 ] ) . given the frequency range of biophotons in eq.([intro1 ] ) , the hard high energy scale @xmath12 of the sources in eq.([intro9 ] ) approach those of nuclear transmutations in biological systems .",
    "this forms the basis of the theoretical explanation of biophotons being proposed in this work .",
    "we here review some extensive _ experimental _ literature on biological systems which describe nuclear transmutations .",
    "no detailed _ theory _ is given for how biological systems allow for reactions at nuclear energies beyond the statement that such large energy transformations involve collective energies of many collectively acting electrons .",
    "many electrons dumping their individually smaller energies into a single high energy nuclear reaction may contribute to a nuclear transmutation process with plenty of available biophysical energy .",
    "due mainly to the lack of a clear and detailed biophysical theory of nuclear transmutations , the experimental data is considered by some to be controversial .",
    "the present lack of a biophysical theory of how the collective energy of many degrees of freedom is focused on a few nuclear transmutation events by no means reflects badly on the reliable experimental data which clearly indicates nuclear transmutations .",
    "reports of specific nuclear reactions which have not actually been directly observed also contribute to the controversy . if one does not report that which has not been directly and clearly observed , then what remains is considerable quality experimental data in favor of biophysical nuclear transmutations .",
    "pioneering experimental work on biological nuclear transmutations were carried out by kervran@xcite .",
    "crabs , shellfish and crayfish have shells made largely of calcium . often these animals _ molt _ , i.e. lose their shells and then create new shells .",
    "typically , a crab of size @xmath13 is covered by a shell of weight @xmath14 . during molting , these animals",
    "stay away from each other since they are vulnerable .",
    "it is unlikely that calcium could be passed between different animals during multing . in the entire body of a crab",
    "there is only enough calcium to produce @xmath15 of a shell taking into account the calcium carbonate stored in the hepato - pancreas just before molting . in about a day",
    ", such a crab will grow a new shell . in water _ completely devoid of calcium _ , shellfish can still create their calcium - bearing shells as shown by an experiment performed at the maritime laboratory of roscoff@xcite .",
    "a crayfish was put into a sea water basin from which calcium carbonate had been removed by precipitation .",
    "the animal made a new shell anyway .",
    "chemical analysis made on animals secreting their shells has revealed that calcium carbonate is formed on the outer side of a membrane . on the opposite side of the membrane , there is no calcium@xcite .",
    "the detailed nuclear transmutation source of the calcium is unknown .",
    "possibilities have been conjectured .",
    "normal egg shells produced by hens contain calcium .",
    "hens were confined in an area in which there was no source of calcium and no calcium was present in their diet@xcite .",
    "the calcium deficiency became clearly manifested after a few days .",
    "eggs with soft shells were laid .",
    "purified mica containing virtually no calcium was fed to the hens .",
    "the hens jumped on the mica and began scratching around it very rapidly , panting over it ; then they rested , rolling their heads on it , threw it into the air , and began scratching it again . the next day eggs with normal shells ( @xmath16 ) were laid .",
    "an experiment of this kind , using the same mica , was undertaken with guinea - fowls over a period of forty days@xcite .",
    "the administering of the mica was suspended three times and each time soft - shelled eggs were laid .",
    "it was suggested that the calcium in the egg shells was borrowed from the bones of the hens .",
    "the question of why soft eggs were laid when the mica was withheld remained unanswered .",
    "the detailed nuclear transmutation source of the calcium is again unknown .",
    "a number of different families of microorganisms , such as aspergillus niger and saccharomyces cerevisiae , create potassium during growth@xcite .",
    "there has also been a failure of balance measurements to predict actual retention of magnesium and calcium by rats .",
    "these were determined by direct carcass analysis@xcite .",
    "although biological nuclear transmutations have certainly taken place , the detailed reactions involved are presently unclear .",
    "bacterial cultures can have effects on nuclear reaction rates .",
    "measurements of the mercury nuclear weak decay , @xmath17 yield a half life of @xmath18 days .",
    "when such nuclei , embedded in @xmath19 molecules , are placed into a microbiological culture , the weak decay rates are severely reduced@xcite indicating other branches of nuclear transmutation reactions .    the bacterial culture _",
    "deinococcus radiodurans _ comfortably lives , multiples and does not mutate under the intense radiation which does considerable damage to many inanimate condensed matter systems .",
    "these bacteria can live within a nuclear reactor .",
    "the detailed mechanism for such a possibility is unknown .",
    "however , the metals within such bacteria can shield radiation with sufficient surface plasma excitations associated with weak interaction transmutations .",
    "finally , it has been experimentally shown@xcite , employing the mssbauer effect , that changes in the expected isotope concentrations of @xmath20 and @xmath21 exist within growing microbial cultures .",
    "however , as an example of unfortunately reporting results beyond what is actually observed , we point out the final report@xcite that the strong interaction fusion was observed ; i.e. @xmath22 we find it more likely that the reaction sequence takes place in the form @xmath23 altogether , @xmath24 with the final state neutrinos as the signature of a weak process .",
    "the experiment in and by itself does not distinguish between eq.([strong ] ) and eq.([weak ] ) and so we prefer workers not to report what they have not directly observed .",
    "the experimental data , however , remains of _ central importance _ as clear evidence of biological nuclear transmutations .",
    "soft photon emission from a charged particle scattering event are those photons radiated into coherent states which emerge from currents classical to a sufficient degree of accuracy@xcite . as a consequence of these classical current sources ,",
    "soft photons have poisson counting statistics@xcite as in eq.([intro7 ] ) .",
    "consider a particle with charge @xmath25 scattering off a fixed target with acceleration @xmath26 wherein @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the initial and final velocity and the delta function is implicitly spread out in time by the duration time @xmath29 of the scattering event .",
    "the classical radiated energy is given by @xmath30 if @xmath31 is the number of photons radiated into a bandwidth @xmath32 , then eq.([sph2 ] ) reads @xmath33 for more general scattering events or decays , the distribution of emitted photons obeys @xmath34 for charged particle scattering , eq.([sph3 ] ) implies @xmath35 wherein @xmath36 .",
    "the case of beta decay for the neutron @xmath37 for a given nuclear reaction , the rules for calculating the quantum electrodynamic beta function @xmath38 in eq.([sph4 ] ) are well known .",
    "thus , the first biophoton experimental eq.([intro6 ] ) is explained by nuclear transmutations . the second biophoton experimental eq.([intro7 ] ) is also explained by nuclear transmutations since classical currents imply poisson statistics .",
    "the third biophoton experimental eq.([intro8 ] ) can be derived but the details are a bit more subtle as will be shown below .",
    "in order to understand time delayed bursts of soft photons , one may consider the general rules of quantum mechanics concerning the notion of the decay of a quantum state .      in the general theory ,",
    "let us suppose a quantum state @xmath39 is present at time zero for a system with hamiltonian @xmath40 . at time",
    "@xmath41 the state will then be @xmath42 .",
    "the amplitude that the state @xmath39 survives for a time @xmath41 is then @xmath43 the survival probability that the state @xmath39 exists at time @xmath41 is the absolute value squared of the survival amplitude squared , @xmath44 the transition rate per unit time @xmath45 for a transition away from the state @xmath39 is @xmath46 the special case , @xmath47 , leads to an exponential decay in the survival probability @xmath48 . for the general case ,",
    "there are time variations in @xmath45 and @xmath49    formally , the survival amplitude of a quantum state is related to the energy probability density distribution of that state , @xmath50 via the fourier transform @xmath51 eq.([sa6 ] ) follows from eq.([sa1 ] ) and eq.([sa5 ] ) .",
