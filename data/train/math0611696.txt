    "in particular , we will explain and generalize results of landsberg and manivel @xcite connecting prolongations and secant varieties , as well as apply these ideas to the computation of some nontrivial secant equations arising in phylogenetics .    recall that if @xmath8 is a projective variety , @xmath9 is the zariski closure of the union of all @xmath10 planes spanned by @xmath4 points in @xmath11 let @xmath12 and suppose that the smallest degree of a minimal generator of @xmath13 is @xmath14 .",

    "are connections relating prolongations to polarizations of homogeneous forms and to symbolic powers of ideals .",
    "relationships between symbolic powers and secant ideals are not new ; for example containment of secant ideals in symbolic powers appears explicitly in proposition 2.1 of catalano - johnson in @xcite and corollary 4.6 of vermeire in @xcite shows that if @xmath25 is smooth , a graded piece of a high enough symbolic power cuts out its secant line variety set - theoretically .",
    "one reason that theorem [ thm : sec ] is useful is that it allows for the straightforward computation of equations that belong to the secant ideals @xmath26 using linear algebra .",

    "we conclude the paper by returning to our original motivation which was the relationship to algebraic statistics , where algebraic varieties are interpreted as statistical models . passing to the secant variety in algebraic geometry amounts to taking a mixture model in statistics .",
