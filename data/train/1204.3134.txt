    "as predicted by early band theory studies,@xcite charge carriers in graphene are chiral quasiparticles that have a linear dirac - like dispersion relation resulting in fascinating electronic  @xcite and transport  @xcite properties . as a result of this linear energy - momentum relationship , the valence and conduction bands intersect at the dirac points located at the brillouin zone corners . for neutral graphene ,",
    "the chemical potential lies exactly at the dirac points .",
    "use of a gate potential can shift the chemical potential away from the dirac point and thus tune the charge density of the graphene device over a large range ( as compared to other electronic materials ) .",
    "the high degree of control over the charge density and the linear dispersion relation are features that distinguish graphene from the two - dimensional electron gas in semiconductor heterostructures and other metallic conductors .",
    "understanding the mechanism for charge carrier transport in graphene in the low carrier density regime ( the linear dispersion regime ) and in the presence of disorder has received considerable attention.@xcite    the wide variety of fabrication techniques  @xcite has resulted in graphene devices that operate in different disorder regimes . the strength of the disorder charge carriers encounter can be quantified via the electron mobility .",
    "the standard fabrication method of mechanical exfoliation and deposition of graphene flakes on sio@xmath1 substrates  @xcite can result in good quality devices with mobilities approaching a few tens of thousands @xmath2 , values comparable to those found in conventional semiconductor devices .",
    "yet , the substrate provides a source of impurities  @xcite and corrugations  @xcite for the electrons to scatter , limiting the mean free path @xmath3 to about a hundred nanometers .",
    "etching away the substrate is routinely done to produce suspended graphene devices , removing some sources of scattering .",
    "etching followed by current annealing increases the carrier mobility in suspended samples to values exceeding 200,000 @xmath2 , resulting in mean free paths comparable to the size of the device.@xcite similar sample quality ( 80,000 @xmath2 carrier mobility ) is obtained in devices where the substrate is single - crystal hexagonal boron nitride.@xcite    it is apparent that replacing oxide based substrates by high - quality crystal substrates or suspended graphene results in devices with improved mobility and reduced electron scattering events.@xcite for transport near or at the dirac point , where the density of states vanishes , the conductivity has a minimum value ( @xmath4 ) , even for ideal pristine graphene.@xcite experimentally , the phase coherent transport in graphene devices with short - and - wide geometries has been characterized as ballistic  @xcite indicating evanescent wave transport . in an ideal ( no impurities or defects ) graphene device , the mean free path is longer than the size of the device resulting in ballistic conductivity .",

    "fano shot noise is the metric of choice to assess the mechanism for electronic transport in mesoscopic devices .",
    "however , the fano shot noise is of limited applicability , with the same value for the fano factor found in disordered or pristine devices .",
    "shot noise measurements can determine the statistics relevant for transport in mesoscopic conductors .",

    "it has also been established that for poisson processes @xmath6 and for diffusive metallic conductors @xmath7.@xcite    however , the fano factor calculated for pristine graphene,@xcite disordered systems,@xcite samples with substrate roughness,@xcite and for transport along an n - p junction  @xcite all have similar magnitude ( @xmath0 ) to that found in diffusive metallic conductors , making the fano shot noise a cumbersome measure of the transport mechanism in graphene devices.@xcite calculations in pristine graphene predict that the fano factor at the dirac point is identically 1/3 when ( 1 ) a wide device ( where the aspect ratio",

    "our quest for a better measure to assess transport mechanisms begins with a simple question : how does the conductance change with respect to the vertical displacement of one of the leads ? by calculating the conductance between two metallic contacts , we model transport in two - terminal devices .",
    "we extract the conductance profile from the dependence of the conductance on the position of one of the leads , and use this to distinguish the mechanism of transport .",
    "in particular , we study the transport properties of clean and disordered graphene devices contacted by narrow metallic leads where one of the two leads can be moved along the edge of the device .",

    "ballistic transport is expected in an ideal graphene strip , given that the crystal lattice has no defects and no impurities are present .",
    "yet for ideal graphene , the dynamics of the electrons produce the same shot noise as that found in classical diffusion .  @xcite determining the transport mechanism in graphene devices is important given that transport experiments are possible in the quasi - ballistic limit , that is , where the mean free path is of the order of the size of the system .    here , we argue that the transition from diffusive to ballistic transport in graphene , along with the limiting cases , can be quantified by alternative methods based on measuring the flow of charge in the system . first , the conductance profile , that is , the conductance as a function of the vertical displacement of one of the leads , can give a measure of the flow inside the device . for the case of ballistic transport , scattering does not impede the flow of charge carriers and the conductance profiles are well described by a linear ( triangular ) fit due to the convolution of the square windows created by the two leads . in the case of diffusive transport ,",
    "the charge carriers experience several scattering events and the transport is then well described by brownian motion with a drift . thus , charge flow will be a gaussian function characteristic of diffusion ; for this reason , the conductance profile can be fitted to a gaussian function .",

    "our calculations take into account all possible trajectories that the charge carriers can take , including the possibility of several reflections from the leads and multiple scattering events from the walls of the device . the presence of random disorder due to charged impurities in the substrate results in conductance maps with no interference patterns , ( fig .",
    "[ clean_edge_bulk ] , middle and right panels ) .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ clean_edge_bulk ] is the conductance map for a system where the mean free path ( @xmath80 nm ) is larger than the size of the device ( @xmath81 nm ) .",
    "this value of @xmath3 is attainable in graphene devices with a crystalline bn - substrate , resulting in relatively high mobility  @xcite .",
    "the mean free path of the system pictured in the right panel is @xmath82 nm , comparable to high quality graphene devices in a silicon oxide substrate .",
    "ballistic transport is expected when the mean free path is larger than the size of the system .",
    "in contrast , in graphene devices with weak bulk disorder such that @xmath83 , we find diffusive transport signatures .",
    "this indicates that for the system and sizes considered , multiple reflections of the dirac electrons from the edges dominate .",
    "this mesoscopic effect needs to be carefully considered in both theoretical and experimental studies on mesoscopic graphene flakes . as a result",
    ", spm imaging could be used to explore the ballistic to diffusive transition in graphene devices .",
    "the visible interference pattern in the conductance maps would be robust against the presence of edge disorder , inevitable in most experimental realizations , but is sensitive to the presence of disorder due to bulk disorder in the system .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on possible experimental realizations of spm measurements in graphene .",
    "several spm measurements have been carried out for graphene devices on a sio@xmath1 substrate  @xcite and can be readily carried out in suspended graphene , where the ballistic transport regime can be reached , in graphene membranes ,  @xcite and in devices with crystalline substrate , where the ballistic to diffusive cross - over should be observable .",
    "we have proposed a method to study the mechanisms of electronic transport based on displacement conductance , that is , the conductance as a function of the position of the drain lead in a two - terminal device .",
    "the method extracts the conductance profile of the charge flow at the edge of the device and it can be applied to discern the mechanism of transport from ballistic to diffusive .",
    "it is worth noting that this technique might be capable of uncovering signatures of anomalous transport in mesoscopic systems .",
    "several quantum interference effects ( fabry - prot resonances and ucfs ) are also found in the resulting conductance curves .",
    "the method that we applied to graphene is general , resolves the transport mechanism in graphene which can not be accomplished via fano shot noise , and can be used as well to study other systems such as semiconductor heterostructures .    in this article",
    ", we simulated spm measurements for the same devices considered in the conductance profile study .",
    "probe imaging is important as we are able to visualize the flow of charge and do not have to rely on transport metrics . for the graphene devices considered , the spm simulations suggest diffusive rather than ballistic transport even in the  clean \" regime where the mean free path is larger than the systems size .",
    "our numerical results suggest that in the process of escaping the device , charge carriers perform multiple reflections . from our simulations",
    ", we expect that spm measurements are well suited to study the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport in graphene devices .",
