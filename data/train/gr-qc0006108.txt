    "in many inflationary models the effective potential energy density of a scalar field is responsible for an epoch of accelerated inflationary expansion  @xcite .",
    "very often one assumes that inflation is driven by a scalar field of the liouville form , i.e. , a exponential potential , because this kind of potential arises in various higher - dimensional supergravity  @xcite and superstring  @xcite models  @xcite .",
    "although there are many scalar fields in superstring theories , in the past it was often assumed that typically only one scalar field was responsible for the inflation , while those having higher exponents were quickly redshifted away .",
    "however , it has been found  @xcite that the so - called _",
    "assisted inflation _ may occur when several scalar fields are present , even if each individual field is too steep to drive the inflation , provided that the fields are uncoupled and interact only through the geometry .",
    "on the other hand , if the fields interact directly with each other , the opposite effect may happen and the presence of cross couplings beteween fields may hinder inflation  @xcite .    assisted inflation has been mainly studied in power - law solutions ( @xmath1 ) for the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology , which can be shown  @xcite to be the late - time attractor for the evolution of this kind of model .",

    "the purpose of this work is to extend previous studies on multi - scalar field cosmologies in two directions : firstly , we will use general solutions ( instead of the special power - law ones ) to analyze if the presence of several fields generically helps or impedes inflation , and secondly , going beyond the aforementioned frw cosmology , we will consider the anisotropic inhomogeneous generalization given by bianchi type i models . thus in section   [ sec : intfrw ] we deal with @xmath2 interacting scalar fields in a frw spacetime and use the general solution to show that the larger is the number of interacting scalar fields the less likely is inflation",
    ". section  [ sec : intspace ] makes plausible for more general scalar field potentials the results obtained in section  [ sec : intfrw ] for exponential potentials .",
    "we do not know the solution for @xmath2 non - interacting scalar fields in a frw cosmology in the general case , but we use the discussion of the late - time attractor of section  [ sec : attractor ] to restrict the analysis of uncoupled fields in section  [ sec : nonintfrw ] to the particular case in which all fields are assumed to be equal , for which the general solution can be found .",
    "we show that non - interacting fields generically cooperate to assist inflation .",
    "the density fluctuations corresponding to the last case are discussed in section  [ sec : density ] .",
    "general solutions of anisotropic bianchi  i cosmologies with interacting and uncoupled fields are used in the first part of section  [ sec : intbianchi ] and subsection  [ sec : nonintbianchi ] , respectively , to check that also in those cases interacting fields make inflation more difficult while uncoupled fields assit it .",

    "is @xmath60 for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 for @xmath47 .",
    "taking @xmath63 in ( [ 3.17 ] ) we get @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 are real integration constants .",
    "we see from  ( [ a ] ) and  ( [ 5.1 ] ) that @xmath68 so that , while for @xmath69 the scale factor goes to @xmath70 as @xmath71 , one has that for @xmath72 the scale factor goes to infinity when @xmath71 . on account of equations  ( [ 5.3 ] ) one may assume that the latter occurs as @xmath73 , for an appropriate value of @xmath74 .",
    "let us now write @xmath75 and expand ( [ 5.3 ] ) and  ( [ eqaprop ] ) about @xmath76 and @xmath77 , keeping only terms linear in @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 and @xmath80 now , we see from ( [ a ] ) and  ( [ 5.1 ] ) that @xmath81 if we use this in ( [ eq : adelta ] ) , we get successively @xmath82 and @xmath83 we see then that if @xmath26 the solution does inflate at least along some time interval .",

    "the solution does not inflate and it approaches to the free scalar field solution .",
    "these results are in accordance with those obtained with particular solutions by other authors  @xcite",
    ".    it would be surprising if for @xmath47 the scale factor had a behavior drastically departing from that suggested by the previous analysis when @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , we see from ( [ a ] ) and ( [ 5.11 ] ) that @xmath95 so that , as a consequence of ( [ 5.3 ] ) , @xmath27 goes to infinity as @xmath96 . from ( [ 5.3 ] ) we see that @xmath97 , when @xmath96 and , by using ( [ de ] ) , @xmath98 which can be written as @xmath99 in the asymptotic regime in which @xmath100 we have @xmath101 , so that from ( [ eq : log ] ) we get @xmath102 and , finally , @xmath103 we see that the solution does not inflate .      the results of the above section show that we can introduce an @xmath2 -dimensional euclidean internal vector space containing the @xmath2-component vector @xmath104 built with @xmath2 minimally coupled scalar fields .",

    "in particular it leads to consider its equation of state @xmath121 .",
    "on the other hand , the state equation for fluid representing stiff matter is @xmath122 with @xmath123 . because of the additivity of the stress - energy tensor it makes sense to consider an effective perfect fluid description with equation of state @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the overall ( i.e. effective ) adiabatic index . for this",

    "when we impose this condition on ( [ ga ] ) , we obtain that @xmath135 hence , when there is only one scalar field the solution inflates for @xmath136 .",

    "we can generalize this analysis to an arbitrary potential @xmath137 . in this case",
    "we obtain that @xmath138 , so that the interacting @xmath2 scalar fields might make inflation more unlikely in a frw spacetime .",

    "the bianchi  vi@xmath0 model can be written as follows : @xmath296    we first consider , as in previous sections , @xmath2 scalar fields @xmath3 interacting through the exponential potential  ( [ po ] ) .",
    "the corresponding einstein - klein - gordon equations are @xmath297 @xmath298 @xmath299 as formerly , one can check that the vector @xmath300 where @xmath222 is a @xmath2-dimensional arbitrary constant vector , is a first integral of the klein - gordon equation set ( [ klg5 ] ) . by using this result and",
    "the value of @xmath301 one obtains from ( [ ef5 ] ) , we get @xmath302    the solutions of this equation are not known .",
    "however , investigating the stability of its fixed points , the asymptotic behavior of the general solution can be obtained in a simple way . in order to see whether assisted inflation works in bianchi type vi@xmath0 metrics it is sufficient to analyze the special case @xmath303 . in terms of the variable @xmath304 defined by ( [ o ] ) , equation ( [ g35 ] ) becomes @xmath305(\\omega+1)h=0.\\ ] ] this equation has three fixed points : @xmath306 , @xmath307 if @xmath308 asymptotically , and @xmath309 , which correspond to @xmath310 , @xmath287 and @xmath311 respectively .",
    "now , we investigate the stability of these solutions when @xmath225 blows up . expanding the solution about fixed points , that is , making @xmath312 with @xmath313",
    ", we get @xmath314 for @xmath315 , which shows it is unstable , as in the case discussed in the previous section . on the other hand ,",
    "one obtains equation ( [ ep ] ) for the linear approximation around @xmath316 , and @xmath317 in the case of @xmath318 .",
    "we conclude that the asymptotic solution @xmath319 is stable for @xmath265 , which means @xmath26 ( for this set of potential slopes we have inflation ) , and @xmath318 is stable for @xmath320 .",
    "note that @xmath287 is only an asymptotic solution of ( [ g35 ] ) , with @xmath321 ; however , it acts as an attractor for all solutions that are close to it .    in this special case",
    "in which @xmath303 , one can readily see that the the deceleration parameter for the solutions @xmath287 is ( after recovering the implicit absolute value around @xmath33 ) @xmath322 which is negative for @xmath323 .",
    "again , the more interacting scalar fields the less likely is inflation , which ensues when @xmath324 .",
    "if one assumes now that the scalar fields do not interact directly and one sets all the fields equal , as in sections  [ sec : nonintfrw ] and  [ sec : nonintbianchi ] , it is easily seen that the attracting power - law solutions inflate when @xmath173 , so that the scalar fields cooperate to assist inflation .",
    "we have studied the effects of the appearance of more than one scalar field both in frw spacetimes and in anisotropic bianchi  i cosmologies .",
    "instead of using the important but particular power - law solutions , we have taken advantage of the general solution to analyze the generic behavior in frw . in bianchi  i the power - law solutions are isotropic and , thus , very particular , so that the use of the general solution is even more illustrative . in all cases",
    "we have found , in agreement with calculations made by other authors with power - law solutions in frw , that the existence of more than one scalar field assists inflation provided that they are uncoupled and interact only through expansion . also , in this case , the spectrum of density perturbations becomes closer to scale invariance as the number of fields increases .",
    "if , on the contrary , the fields interact directly with each other , inflation is less likely to occur .",
    "the same behavior has been obtained in bianchi  vi@xmath0 universes , but ( not having available the general solution ) only for power - law solutions , which have been shown to be attractors when inflation arises .",
    "these results reinforce our belief that the presence of several uncoupled scalar fields in more general cosmologies fosters inflation , but that , in contradistinction , mutually interacting scalar fields tend to hinder the inflationary process .",
