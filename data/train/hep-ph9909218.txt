    "recent advances in string theory have revolutionized particle phenomenology . namely , the previously unreachable planck , string , and grand unification scales ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively ) can now be brought down to a tev range @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , one expects low energy phenomenology that can be tested in current and future collider experiments .",
    "an attractive realization of the above idea was recently proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali @xcite . in their model , the standard model ( sm )",
    "particles live on a d3-brane , predicted in the string theory , and the sm gauge interactions are confined to this brane . on the other hand",
    ", gravity is allowed to propagate in the extra dimensions . in order to bring the planck scale ( @xmath8 gev ) to the tev range",
    ", the size of these compactified dimensions is made very large compared to @xmath9 .",
    "the relation among the planck scale @xmath5 , size @xmath10 of the extra dimensions , and the effective planck scale @xmath11 is given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of extra ( compactified ) dimensions . from this relation , the size @xmath10 of the compactified extra dimensions",
    "can be estimated .",
    "assuming that the effective planck scale @xmath11 is in the tev range , it gives a very large @xmath10 of the size of our solar system for @xmath14 , which is obviously ruled out by the experiment .",
    "however , for all @xmath15 the expected @xmath10 is less than @xmath16  mm , and therefore does not contradict existing gravitational experiments .    with the sm particles residing on the brane and the graviton freely propagating in the extra dimensions , the sm particles can couple to a graviton with a strength comparable to that of the electroweak interactions . a graviton in the extra dimensions is equivalent , from the 4d - point of view , to a tower of infinite number of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states with masses @xmath17 .",
    "the coupling to each of these kk states is @xmath18 .",
    "the overall coupling is , however , obtained by summing over all the kk states , and thus is @xmath19 . since @xmath11 is in the tev range , the gravitational interaction is as strong as electroweak interactions , and thus can give rise to many consequences that can be tested in both the accelerator and non - accelerator experiments .    a large number of phenomenological studies in this area have recently appeared . among these studies , the strongest lower",
    "bound on the effective planck scale ( 30100 tev for @xmath20 ) comes from astrophysical ( sn1987a ) and cosmological constraints  @xcite .",
    "collider signals and constraints @xcite come from diboson , dilepton , dijet , top - pair production , and real graviton emissions .    in general ,",
    "present collider experiments are sensitive to the effective planck scale below @xmath21 tev . in refs .",
    "@xcite the drell - yan and diphoton production at the tevatron were used to constrain the scale @xmath11 . in these studies , however , only the invariant mass distribution of the lepton or photon pair is used .",
    "we found that the distribution in the central scattering angle , in addition to the invariant mass distribution , further helps to constrain the scale @xmath11 .    in this work",
    ", we use the double differential cross - section , @xmath22 , to probe the effective planck scale @xmath11 in run i and run ii at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "the advantage of using double differential distribution is that the differences in the invariant mass and scattering angle between the sm and the gravity model can be contrasted simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , for a @xmath23 process the invariant mass @xmath24 and the central scattering angle @xmath25 already span the entire phase space .",
    "we , therefore , do not need to optimize the kinematic cuts or choose optimal variables ( _ e.g. _ , forward - backward asymmetry , charged forward - backward asymmetry , etc . ) , because all the relevant information is already contained in the @xmath26 distribution .",
    "we will show that sensitivity obtained in this study has improved substantially , compared to previous studies , in which only single differential distributions were used . by analyzing double differential distributions in dilepton and diphoton production simultaneously , we are able to reach sensitivity on @xmath11 at the 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) as high as @xmath0 tev in the tevatron run i , @xmath1 tev in run iia , @xmath2  tev in run iib , and @xmath3 tev at the lhc , for @xmath4 .",
    "this is our main result .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",

    "an effective lagrangian for the low scale gravity interactions between the sm particles and the graviton was derived by han _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "this effective theory is valid up to a scale of about @xmath11 .",

    "it is implied that all possible @xmath41 initial states are summed over . in what follows ,",
    "we substitute @xmath42 for convenience and for use as a fit parameter .",
    "similarly , we calculate the diphoton production .",

    "we use the range of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ diphoton ] ) from @xmath45 to 1 , even though the final state photons are indistinguishable from each other .",
    "we account for nlo qcd corrections via a @xmath46-factor ( see eqs .",
    "( [ dilepton ] ) and ( [ diphoton ] ) ) .",
    "we use @xmath47 in the calculations .    for the diagrams with virtual kaluza - klein graviton exchange",
    "it is necessary to introduce an explicit upper cut - off , of the order of @xmath11 , to keep the sum over the kk states finite .",
    "a naive argument for the existence of such a cut - off is that the effective theory breaks down above @xmath11 , where detailed understanding of string dynamics is required . a recent observation by bando _ et al .",
    "@xcite suggests a way around this issue by postulating that the brane is actually `` flexible , '' with a certain tension .",
    "when the sm particles that live on the brane couple to the kaluza - klein states of a bulk gravitational field , the brane has to `` stretch '' out in order to `` catch '' these kaluza - klein states .",
    "these stretches are actually quantum fluctuations , usually suppressed exponentially .",
    "the higher the @xmath13 of the kaluza - klein state , the stronger the suppression is . from the above argument , the contribution of high kaluza - klein states is suppressed , and the arbitrary cut - off in the sum over the kk states becomes irrelevant .",
    "@xcite showed that if the brane tension is equal to @xmath11 , total amplitude with such a suppression is the same as the amplitude on a non - flexible brane with a cut - off scale set at @xmath11 .",
    "another argument , coming from the fundamental string theory , is that the coupling constant of each kaluza - klein state ( @xmath48 ) is , in general , not independent of @xmath49 , but exponentially suppressed @xcite : @xmath50 here @xmath51 depends on the normalization of the gauge kinetic term and @xmath52 is a constant that depends on the fundamental theory . hence , even though all the kaluza - klein levels are summed over , the sum is not divergent and is equivalent to the unsuppressed sum with a certain cut - off scale .",
    "following these recent observations , we relaxed the assumption about the cut - off scale @xmath53 when summing the effects of all virtual graviton propagators . in han _",
    "et al . _ , at amplitude level , the sum of the propagators @xmath54 is truncated for @xmath55 , where @xmath53 is chosen to be @xmath11 . in this work ,",
    "we allow @xmath53 to be different from @xmath11 , but in order for the effective theory to be valid , it is required that @xmath56 .",
    "we define a scale factor @xmath57 , such that @xmath58 .",
    "after this modification , the corresponding change in the above equations is : @xmath59 in the numerical analysis , we use @xmath60 as the fit parameter in order to reduce non - linearity of the problem .",
    "once the best fit value of @xmath60 is obtained , it is straightforward to obtain the corresponding value of @xmath11 for given @xmath13 and @xmath52 .",
    "we use typical kinematic and geometrical acceptance of the ddetector to estimate the sensitivity in run i and run ii of the tevatron for both dilepton and diphoton production : @xmath61 where @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "the integrated luminosities used in our study are 130 pb@xmath64 , 2 fb@xmath64 , and 20  fb@xmath64 for run i , iia , and iib , respectively .",
    "in addition to the acceptance losses we take into account the detector resolution effects , as well as the longitudinal smearing of the primary interaction vertex .    for the lhc ( @xmath65 tev @xmath66 collision )",
    "we use the following `` typical '' acceptance cuts : @xmath67    in addition to the acceptance losses , we assume the efficiency of either dilepton or diphoton reconstruction and identification to be 90% for the lhc or run ii of the tevatron , and 80% for run i. in the case of charged leptons , detection inefficiency comes from the requirements on consistency of a track in the central detector with a calorimeter energy deposition ( electrons ) or a track in the outer muon detector ( muons ) . for photons",
    "the inefficiency primarily comes from the losses due to photon conversions in the material in front of the central tracker .      in order to estimate the sensitivity of collider experiments to the low scale gravity model",
    ", we need to generate some `` realistic '' data sets . to set limits on the scale @xmath11",
    ", we assume that the sm is correct up to the energies of the tevatron or the lhc .",
    "we use the sm cross section of dilepton production ( the first line in eq .",
    "( [ dilepton ] ) ) to generate a smooth double differential distribution in @xmath68 and @xmath31 .",
    "we divide the @xmath69 plane into a grid of @xmath70 bins , with @xmath68 from 0 gev to 2000 ( 10000 ) gev and @xmath44 from @xmath45 to 1 for tevatron ( lhc ) . for each bin @xmath71 of this grid ,",
    "the expected number of events , @xmath72 , is obtained by multiplying the cross section in this bin by the known integrated luminosity and efficiency .",
    "we further proceed with a monte carlo ( mc ) _",
    "gedankenexperiment_. for each bin @xmath71 we generate a random number of events , @xmath73 , using poisson statistics with the mean @xmath72 . similar _",
    "gedankenexperiment _ is done for the diphoton production .",
    "we use the dilepton or diphoton mc data sets generated in this way to perform the best fit to the low scale gravity model ( see section  [ sec : fit ] ) .",
    "either of the two channels , or their combination can be used in the fit .",
    "we extract the lower limit on the gravity scale @xmath11 by fitting the `` data '' obtained in a mc experiment with a sum of the sm background and kaluza - klein graviton contribution .",
    "we employ both the maximum likelihood method and pure bayesian approach with a flat prior probability for @xmath74 and 0 for @xmath75 .",
    "since we focus on the number of large extra dimensions @xmath76 , , @xmath77 depends on @xmath78 . in the next section",
    ", we will also give the results for @xmath20 by estimating the average @xmath78 for the gravity term in dilepton and diphoton production . ] the fitting procedure is straightforward , as the factor @xmath77 can be taken out of the integration over the phase space .",
    "we generate three templates that describe the cross section in the case of large extra dimensions .",
    "the first one describes the sm cross section on the rectangular grid described in section  [ sec : mc ] .",
    "the other two describe terms proportional to @xmath60 ( interference term ) and to @xmath79 ( kaluza - klein term ) , respectively .",
    "we then parameterize production cross section in each bin of the @xmath80 grid as a bilinear form in @xmath60 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 are the three templates described above .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , we show the 3-d plots for the pure sm , the interference , and pure gravity contributions for dilepton and diphoton production , respectively , at the 2 tev tevatron .",
    "it is clear that the pure sm decreases rapidly with the invariant mass .",
    "this is in contrast with the pure gravity contribution that rises quite sharply with the invariant mass and then turns over due to the effect of parton distribution functions .",
    "the interference term also shows similar characteristics .",
    "the angular distribution also exhibits substantial difference among the pure sm , pure gravity , and the interference .",
    "note the asymmetry of the interference term for dilepton production ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) that arises from the charge asymmetry of the tevatron beams and final state particles .",
    "analogous distribution for diphotons or in the lhc case is symmetric .    the probability to observe certain set of data @xmath85 , where @xmath71 are the bins in @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , as a function of @xmath60 is given by the poisson statistics : @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the integrated luminosity",
    ", @xmath89 is the identification efficiency , and @xmath90 is the cross section given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : template ] ) , integrated over the bin @xmath71 .",
    "we now can use bayes theorem to obtain the probability of @xmath60 , given the observed set @xmath91 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the normalization constant , obtained from the unitarity requirement : @xmath94 @xmath95 is the central value of the @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the assumed gaussian error on the quantity @xmath98 . in order to minimize the uncertainty",
    "@xmath97 we perform _ in situ _ calibration by normalizing @xmath98 to reproduce the observed number of events with @xmath99  gev ( 200 gev ) at the tevatron ( lhc ) ( _ i.e. _ , we use the first mass bin of the mc grid to perform the normalization ) .",
    "such a procedure is justified by the fact that possible contribution from kaluza - klein gravitons virtually does not affect the low mass region ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we , therefore , assume @xmath97 to be 10% or @xmath100 , whichever is smaller .",
    "( when setting limits on @xmath60 we then only use the mass bins above the normalization region , _ i.e. _ @xmath101 . )",
    "the 95% c.l . limit on signal , @xmath102 , is obtained from the following integral equation : @xmath103    a less sophisticated likelihood approach does ignore systematic error on the efficiency and integrated luminosity and simply treats @xmath104 as the likelihood function .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "limit in this case is obtained by requiring the integral of the likelihood function from the physics boundary ( @xmath105 ) to @xmath102 to be equal to 0.95 . as was mentioned before , both approaches yield very close limits on @xmath60 . while the bayesian technique is a natural way to account for the systematic errors on the efficiency ( and background ) estimates ( and this is the approach actually used by the d  experiment to derive limits ) , we implemented the classical likelihood approach as well , primarily to demonstrate the robustness of the limit setting technique .",
    "we further combine the results obtained from the dilepton and diphoton channels by adding the probabilities ( likelihoods ) and solving the integral equation ( [ eq : e95 ] ) ( or its equivalent for the maximum likelihood method ) .    as an additional cross check",
    "we have tested the fitting techniques with a set of the mc experiments assuming a non - zero kaluza - klein graviton contribution .",
    "both the bayesian and maximum likelihood fits were capable of extracting the input value of the gravity scale without a systematic bias , as expected .    to convert @xmath102 from a single mc experiment into a measure of sensitivity of future experiments , we repeat the above procedures ( both the _ gedankenexperiment _ and fit ) many times .",
    "the limits obtained in these repeating experiments are histogrammed .",
    "sensitivity to the parameter @xmath60 is defined as the median of this histogram , _",
    "i.e. _ the point on the sensitivity curve which 50% of future experiments will exceed .",
    "all the limits given in the next section are based on this sensitivity measure .",
    "( an alternative approach that defines sensitivity as the most probable outcome of the _ gedankenexperiment _ agrees with the one we used within 5% accuracy . )",
