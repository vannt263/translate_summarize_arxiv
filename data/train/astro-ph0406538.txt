    "+ numerical simulations @xcite revealed that mergings happen along preferential directions which define matter flow regions , at whose intersection rich clusters form . the environment of these intersections",
    "is represented by the core of superclusters : given the high local density and the small volumes involved , the `` cross section '' for merging between clusters or group - cluster is strongly enhanced and the dynamical processes are accelerated",
    ". therefore , the central part of superclusters are unique and ideal laboratories where to study this astrophysical event .",
    "+ applying a percolation algorithm to cluster catalogues , in order to individuate density enhancements of clusters over the mean density , @xcite obtained catalogues of superclusters at various density excesses : among the richest structures found there are the shapley concentration in the southern hemisphere and the corona borealis supercluster in the northern one .",
