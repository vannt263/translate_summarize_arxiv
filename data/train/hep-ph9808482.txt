    "in this contribution , we briefly review the present status of our ongoing systematic study   of the discovery potential of qcd - instanton induced events in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera .",
    "hard scattering processes in elementary particle physics are successfully described by the standard model of strong ( qcd ) and electro - weak ( qfd ) interactions in its perturbative formulation .",
    "however , perturbation theory does not exhaust all possible hard scattering processes .",
    "instantons  @xcite , fluctuations of ( non - abelian ) gauge fields representing topology changing tunnelling transitions , induce interactions which are absent in conventional perturbation theory . in accord  @xcite with the general chiral anomaly relation , instantons give rise to ( hard ) processes in which certain fermionic quantum numbers are violated , notably , chirality ( @xmath0 ) in ( massless ) qcd and baryon plus lepton number ( @xmath1 ) in qfd .",
    "implications of qcd - instantons for long - distance phenomena have been intensively studied in the past , mainly in the context of the phenomenological instanton liquid model  @xcite and of lattice simulations  @xcite . yet , a direct experimental verification of their existence is lacking up to now .",
    "an experimental discovery of such a novel , non - perturbative manifestation of non - abelian gauge theories would clearly be of basic significance .",
    "the deep - inelastic regime is distinguished by the fact that here hard qcd - instanton induced processes may both be _ calculated _",
    "@xcite within instanton - perturbation theory and possibly _ detected experimentally _  .",
    "as a key feature it has recently been shown  @xcite , that in dis the generic hard scale @xmath2 cuts off instantons with _ large size _ @xmath3 ,",
    "over which one has no control within perturbation theory in the instanton background .",
    "the leading instanton ( @xmath4)-induced process in the dis regime of @xmath5 scattering is displayed in fig .",
    "[ ev - displ ] .",
    "the dashed box emphasizes the so - called instanton-_subprocess _ with its own bjorken variables , @xmath6    the @xmath4-induced cross - section in unpolarized deep - inelastic @xmath7 scattering , @xmath8 , can be shown to factorize  @xcite ( in the bjorken limit , @xmath9 large ) into a sum of differential parton - parton luminosities , @xmath10 , and @xmath4-subprocess cross - sections , @xmath11 , @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes the virtual quarks entering the @xmath4-subprocess from the photon side and @xmath14 denotes the target partons . the differential luminosity @xmath10 , accounting for the number of @xmath15 collisions per @xmath16 collision , has a convolution - like structure  @xcite , involving integrations over the target - parton density , @xmath17 , the @xmath18-flux , @xmath19 , and the _ known _  @xcite flux @xmath20 of the parton @xmath21 in the @xmath4-background .    in eq .",
    "( [ epcross ] ) , the @xmath4-subprocess total cross - section @xmath11 contains the essential instanton dynamics .",
    "we have evaluated the latter  @xcite by means of the optical theorem and the so - called @xmath22-valley approximation  @xcite for the relevant @xmath23 forward elastic scattering amplitude in the @xmath22 background .",
    "this method resums the exponentiating final state gluons in form of the known valley action @xmath24 and reproduces standard @xmath4-perturbation theory at larger @xmath22 separation @xmath25 .",
    "while a semi - quantitative evaluation of @xmath11 may also be performed by means of standard @xmath4-perturbation theory , the use of the @xmath22-valley method allows to extend our calculations to a somewhat larger range in @xmath26 .    corresponding to the symmetries of the theory",
    ", the instanton calculus introduces at the classical level certain ( undetermined ) `` collective coordinates '' like the @xmath27-size parameters @xmath28 and the @xmath22 distance @xmath29 ( in units of the size ) .",
    "observables like @xmath11 must be independent thereof and thus involve integrations over all collective coordinates .",
    "hence , we have generically , @xmath30    the first important quantity of interest , entering eq.([sigma ] ) , is the @xmath4-density , @xmath31 ( tunnelling amplitude ) .",
    "it has been worked out a long time ago  @xcite in the framework of @xmath4-perturbation theory : ( renormalization scale @xmath32 ) @xmath33 in terms of the qcd @xmath34-function coefficients , @xmath35 . in this form",
    "it satisfies renormalization - group invariance at the two - loop level  @xcite .",
    "note that the large , positive power @xmath36 of @xmath37 in the @xmath4-density  ( [ density ] ) would make the integrations over the @xmath38-sizes in eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) infrared divergent without the crucial exponential cut - off  @xcite @xmath39 arising from the virtual quark entering the @xmath4-subprocess from the photon side .",
    "the second important quantity of interest , entering eq.([sigma ] ) , is the @xmath22-interaction , @xmath40 . in the valley approximation ,",
    "the @xmath22-valley action , @xmath41 $ ] , is restricted by conformal invariance to depend only on the `` conformal separation '' , @xmath42 , and its functional form is explicitly known  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath43 remains _ attractive _ for all separations @xmath44 ; specifically , the @xmath22-valley action decreases monotonically from 1 at infinite conformal separation to 0 at @xmath45 , which corresponds to @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    the collective coordinate integration in the cross - section  ( [ sigma ] ) can be performed via _ saddle - point techniques_. one finds @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where the saddle - point solutions @xmath50 and @xmath51 behave qualitatively as @xmath52 thus , the virtuality @xmath53 controls the @xmath38-size : as one might have expected intuitively , highly virtual partons probe only small instantons .",
    "the bjorken - variable @xmath26 , on the other hand , controls the conformal separation between @xmath4 and @xmath43 : for decreasing @xmath26 , the conformal separation decreases .",
    "our quantitative results  @xcite on the _ dominating _ cross - section for a target gluon , @xmath54 , are shown in detail in fig .",
    "[ isorho ] , both as functions of @xmath55 ( left ) and of @xmath26 ( right ) .",
    "the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ isorho ] , indicating lines of constant @xmath50 ( left ) and of constant @xmath56 ( right ) , nicely illustrate the qualitative relations  ( [ qual - exp ] ) and their consequences : the @xmath53 dependence essentially maps the @xmath4-density , whereas the @xmath26 dependence mainly maps the @xmath22-interaction .",
    "compared to our earlier estimates based on the one - loop renormalization - group invariant form  @xcite of the @xmath4-density @xmath31 , the residual dependence on the renormalization scale has now dramatically weakened ( c.f .",
    "[ rgdep ]  ( left ) ) .",
    "this important stabilization of our predictions originates from the use of the _ two - loop _ renormalization - group invariant improvement ( [ density ] , [ b - morretal ] ) of @xmath31 from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "intuitivelely one may expect  @xcite @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , this guess turns out to match quite well our actual choice of the `` best '' scale , @xmath58 , determined by @xmath59 ( c.f . fig .",
    "[ rgdep ]  ( left ) ) .",
    "important information about the range of validity of @xmath4-perturbation for the @xmath4-density and the @xmath22-interaction , in terms of the instanton collective coordinates ( @xmath60 ) , can be obtained from recent ( non - perturbative ) lattice simulations of qcd and translated via the saddle - point relations  ( [ qual - exp ] ) into a `` fiducial '' kinematical region ( @xmath61 )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , from a comparison of the ( one - loop ) perturbative expression of the @xmath4-density  ( [ density ] ) with recent lattice `` data ''  @xcite one infers  @xcite semi - classical @xmath4-perturbation theory to be valid for @xmath62 fm ( c.f .",
    "[ rgdep ]  ( right ) ) .",
    "similarly , it can be argued  @xcite that the attractive , semi - classical valley result for the @xmath22-interaction is supported by lattice simulations down to a minimum conformal separation @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 . the corresponding `` fiducial '' kinematical region for our cross - section predictions in dis is then obtained as  @xcite @xmath65   \\frac{r^\\ast}{\\rho^\\ast}&{\\mbox{\\,\\raisebox{.3ex }      { $ > $ } $ \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!$\\raisebox{-.9ex}{$\\sim$}}\\ , } &    1\\\\   \\end{array}\\right\\}\\rightarrow   \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lclcl}q^\\prime&\\geq & q^\\prime_{\\rm min}&\\simeq &   8 { \\rm\\ gev};\\\\[1ex ]   x^\\prime&\\geq & x^\\prime_{\\rm min}&\\simeq & 0.35.\\\\   \\end{array } \\right .",

    "[ sighera ] displays the finalized @xmath4-induced cross - section at hera , as function of the cuts @xmath66 and @xmath67 , as obtained with the new release `` qcdins 1.6.0 ''  @xcite of our @xmath4-event generator . for the following `` standard cuts '' , @xmath68 including the minimal cuts  ( [ fiducial ] ) extracted from lattice simulations , we specifically obtain @xmath69 where the uncertainties result mainly from the experimental uncertainty in the qcd scale @xmath70 .",
    "hence , with the total luminosity accumulated by experiments at hera , @xmath71 pb@xmath72 , there should be already @xmath73 @xmath4-induced events from the kinematical region  ( [ standard - cuts ] ) on tape . note also that the cross - section quoted in eq .",
    "( [ minimal - cuts ] ) corresponds to a fraction of @xmath4-induced to normal dis ( ndis ) events of @xmath74    thus , it appears to be a question of _ signature _ rather than a question of _ rate _ to discover @xmath4-induced scattering processes at hera .",
    "hence , we turn next to the _ final states _ of @xmath4-induced events in dis .",
    "a monte - carlo generator , qcdins , for instanton - induced events in dis , interfaced to herwig , has been developed .",
    "the monte - carlo simulation essentially proceeds in three steps .",
    "first , quasi - free partons are produced by qcdins with the distributions prescribed by the hard process matrix elements .",
    "next , these primary partons give rise to parton showers , as described by herwig .",
    "finally , the showers are converted into hadrons , again within herwig .    in fig .",
    "[ typical ] we display the lego plot of a typical @xmath4-induced event at hera , as generated by qcdins .",
    "its characteristics directly reflect the essential features of the underlying @xmath4-subprocess and thus may be intuitively understood :    after hadronization , the current quark in fig .",
    "[ ev - displ ] gives rise to a current - quark jet .",
    "no further distinct qjets are expected , since the partons from the @xmath4-subprocess are emitted spherically symmetric in the @xmath75 c.m .",
    "system ( `` @xmath4-c.m . system '' ) .",
    "the gluon multiplicities are generated according to a poisson distribution with mean multiplicity @xmath76 . in view of the large required chirality violation @xmath77 ,",
    "the total mean parton multiplicity is large , of the order of ten .",
    "after hadronization , we therefore expect from the @xmath4-subprocess a final state structure reminiscent of a decaying fireball : @xmath78 hadrons are produced , always including _ strange _ ones .",
    "they are concentrated in a `` band '' at fixed pseudorapidity @xmath79 in the ( @xmath79 , azimuth angle @xmath80)-plane . due to the boost from the @xmath4-c.m .",
    "system to the hera - lab system , the center of the band is shifted away from @xmath81 .",
    "its width is of order @xmath82 , as typical for a spherically symmetric event . for @xmath83 and @xmath84 gev ,",
    "the total invariant mass of the @xmath4-system , @xmath85 , is expected to be in the 10 gev range .",
    "all these expectations are clearly reproduced by our monte - carlo simulation .",
    "these features have been exploited by experimentalists at hera to place first upper limits on the fraction of @xmath4-induced events to normal dis events , in a similar kinematical region as our standard cuts  ( [ standard - cuts ] ) : from the search of a @xmath86 excess in the `` band '' region , the h1 collaboration could establish a limit of @xmath87 % , while the search of an excess in charged multiplicity yields @xmath88 %  @xcite .",
    "the limit from the charged multiplicity distribution has been further improved in ref .",
    "@xcite to about 1 % .",
    "since these experimental upper limits already range close to our estimate  ( [ fraction - fiducial ] ) , it becomes extremely interesting to investigate further possibilities to discriminate @xmath4-induced from ndis final states .",
    "a dedicated multi - observable analysis is in progress , with the aim of producing an instanton - enriched data sample .",
    "furthermore , strategies to reconstruct @xmath26 and @xmath55 from the final state are being developped .",
