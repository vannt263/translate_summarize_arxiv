    "in this note we show that the supermembrane compactified on a torus is invariant under a generalized t - duality transformation @xcite . as a new result , we show how in the string theory limit , the t - duality transformation for the supermembrane becomes the standard t - duality transformation of the closed superstrings compactified on a circle .",
    "the compactified supermembrane on a target space @xmath0 may be formulated in terms of sections on symplectic torus bundles @xcite .",
    "there are two well - defined sectors : one in which a topological condition due to an irreducible wrapping is imposed , that corresponds to the so - called supermembrane with central charges @xcite , and a second one without that restriction .",
    "while the first one can be globally formulated in terms of sections on symplectic torus bundles with @xmath1 monodromy , the second corresponds to the formulation on trivial symplectic torus bundles @xcite .",
    "physically the two sectors have very different properties , among which the most relevant one is that the regularized supermembrane with central charges has discrete spectrum @xcite -so it is a well - defined quantum object- in distinction with the compactified supermembrane without that condition @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that a fundamental formulation of string / m - theory should exist in which the t- and u - duality symmetries are manifest from the start . in particular , it was argued that many massive , gauged supergravities can not be naturally embedded in string theory without such a framework @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the supermembrane on a torus with central charges is in fact the origin of type iib , and iia gauged supergravities in 9d .",
    "we showed the existence of a new @xmath2 symmetry that plays the role of t - duality in the supermembrane interchanging the winding and kk charges but leaving the hamiltonian invariant .",
    "t - duality becomes an exact symmetry of the symplectic torus bundle description of the supermembrane by fixing its energy tension .",
    "we consider now the compactified supermembrane embedded on a target space @xmath0 where @xmath3 is a flat torus .",
    "we consider maps @xmath4 from @xmath0 to the target space , where @xmath5 with @xmath6 are single valued maps onto the minkowski sector of the target space while @xmath7 , with @xmath8 maps onto the @xmath3 compact sector of the target .",
    "the winding condition corresponds to    _ _ sdx^1=2r ( l_s+m_sre);__sdx^2=2r m_sim;__sdx^m=0    where @xmath9 are respectively the radius and the teichmuller parameters of the 2-torus target - space , and @xmath10 , are integers . the physical hamiltonian in the lcg is given by @xmath11\\\\ \\nonumber & + \\int_{\\sigma}t_{11}^{-2/3}\\sqrt{w}\\left[\\frac{t_{11}^{2}}{4}\\{x^{m},x^{n}\\}^{2}- \\overline{\\psi}\\gamma_{- } \\gamma_{m } \\{x^m,\\psi\\}- \\overline{\\psi}\\gamma_{- } \\gamma_{r } \\{x^r,\\psi\\}\\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to the constraints @xmath12 associated with a residual symmetry of the theory : the infinite group of diffeomorphims preserving the riemann basis @xmath13 .",
    "so far , we have described the compactified supermembrane with no distinction between sectors .",
    "we now impose an extra topological restriction on the winding maps @xcite : the irreducible winding constraint , [ central ] _ dx^rdx^s = n^rsarea(t^2)n0 , r , s=1,2 . where @xmath14 .",
    "-when this condition holds , @xmath15 we refer to it as the supermembrane with central charge theory @xcite and it implies that the winding matrix @xmath16 has @xmath17 .",

    "-when this condition vanishes ( @xmath21 ) , this corresponds to a sector that we will call from now on compactified m2 , @xmath21 .",
    "globally it corresponds to a trivial symplectic torus bundle over the base , lets choose for symplicity the flat 2-torus @xmath22 .",
    "it is characterized by having a trivial class of @xmath23 .",
    "the mass operator of the compactified supermembrane with winding and kk contribution @xcite , @xcite , is [ 28 ] mass^2=t_11 ^ 2((2r)^2n i m ) ^2 + ( ( m_1 ^ 2+()+ t_11 ^ 2/3hwhere the @xmath24 is defined in terms of the above hamiltonian @xmath25 once the winding contribution has been extracted @xmath26 @xcite . in the case of the sector of the compactified m2 ,",
    "sector @xmath21 , the winding contribution vanishes .",
    "in this section we introduce the t - duality transformations for the supermembrane theory @xcite .",
    "this goes beyond the t - duality of superstring theory .",
    "the t - duality transformation we consider , is a nonlinear map which interchange the winding modes @xmath27 , associated to the cohomology of the base manifold with the kk charges , @xmath28 associated to the homology of the target torus together with a transformation of the real moduli @xmath29 and complex moduli @xmath30 , both in a nontrivial way . in",
    "the following all transformed quantities under t - duality are denoted by a tilde . in order to define the t - duality transformation we introduce the following @xcite(47 ) dimensionless variables : = t_11a:= t_11 y    where @xmath31 is the supermembrane tension , @xmath32 is the area of the target torus and @xmath33 .",
    "the tilde variables @xmath34 are the transformed quantities under the t - duality . see ( [ trans ] ) for the explicit value of @xmath35 .",
    "the t - duality transformation we introduce is given by @xcite : [ tt1 ]    : & = 1,= ; + : &     +    = _ 0    p + q    ,    _ 1 & _ 2 + _ 1 & _ 2    = _ 0 ^ -1    l_1^ & l_2^ + m_1^ & m_2^    .    with @xmath36 . in the above definition",
    "the t - dual supermembrane corresponds to a new supermembrane where the role of winding and kk charges interchanged , i.e. the kk modes are mapped onto the winding modes @xmath37 and viceversa .",
    "the above property together with the condition @xmath38 ensure that @xmath39 , the main property of t - duality .",
    "the explicit transformations of the real modulus , obtained from the above t - duality transformation is @xmath40 the winding modes and kk charge contribution in the mass squared formula transform in the following way :    t_11n^2 a^2 & = ^2,&= t_11 ^ 2m^2 ^2 ^ 2 .    to see how the @xmath41 ( [ 28 ] ) transforms under t - duality it is important to realize the transformation rules for the fields ,    dx^m = u d^m , d = u e^idx , a = u e^i = u^3/2 , = u^3/2    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 a phase defined in ( 3.22 ) of @xcite and @xmath44 and respectively , its dual @xmath45 is    d=2[(_1+)d^1+(_2+_2)d^2 ]    the phase @xmath46 cancels with the h.c . the transformation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the relation between the hamiltonians through a t - dual transformation is h=,= h.    we thus obtain for the mass squared formula the following identity , m^2 = t_11 ^ 2 n^2 a^2 + + t_11 ^ 2/3h = ( + t_11 ^ 2 m^2 ^2)+ .      t - duality does not only acts at local level but also globally . as shown in @xcite one can define an equivalence class with the elements of the coinvariant group associated to the monodromy group @xmath47 , @xmath48 such that for any @xmath49 and @xmath50 , it characterizes one symplectic torus bundle . in the formulation of the supermembrane on that geometrical structure ,",
    "@xmath51 are identified with the kk charges .",
    "the action of @xmath47 , the monodromy group , leaves the equivalence class invariant .",
    "we now consider the duality transformation introduced previously . under the duality transformation",
    "the equivalence class transform as    \\{+g- } \\{_0+(_0 g _ 0 ^ -1)_0-_0 } , hence for the dual bundle it holds , @xmath52 that is , as an element of the coinvariant group of @xmath53 .",
    "we then conclude that the duality transformation , in addition to the transformation on the moduli @xmath9 , also maps the geometrical structure onto an equivalent symplectic torus bundle with monodromy @xmath54 .",
    "we notice that the transformation depends crucially on the original equivalence class of the coinvariant group .",
    "so for a nonequivalent symplectic torus bundle the dual transformations is realized with a different @xmath19 matrix @xmath55 .",
    "now we are in position to determine the t - duality as a natural symmetry for the family of supermembranes with central charges .",
    "we take : [ la ] = z=1t_0=. it imposes a relation between the energy scale of the tension of the supermembrane and the moduli of the torus fiber and that of its dual .",
    "indeed we can think in two different ways : given the values of the moduli it fixes the allowed tension @xmath56 or on the other way around , for a fixed tension @xmath56 , the radius , the teichmuller parameter of the 2-torus , and the kk charges satisfy ( [ la ] ) .",
    "we then consider within the physical configurations of the supermembrane with central charges , the string - like configurations x^m",
    "= x^m ( , q_1 ^ 1+q_2 ^ 2),a^r = a^r ( , q_1 ^ 1+q_2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath57 are relative prime integral numbers .",
    "@xmath58 are scalar fields on the torus @xmath13 , a compact riemann surface , hence they may always be expanded on a fourier basis in term of a double periodic variable of that form .",
    "the restriction of @xmath59 to be relatively prime integral numbers arises from the global periodicity condition . on that configurations all the brackets \\{x^m , x^n}=\\{x^m , a^r}=\\{a^r ,",
    "a^s}=0 vanish .",
    "we then obtain the final expression for the mass contribution of the string states @xcite : [ 78 ] m_11 ^ 2_sc= ( n t_11a)^2+()^2 + 8 ^ 2 r_11t_11q - p ( n_l+n_r ) where @xmath60 are relatively prime .",
    "we notice that @xmath60 may be interpreted as the wrapping of the membrane around the two cycles of the target torus .",
    "the corresponding change in the harmonic sector is @xcite dx_h=(qmd^1+pd^2 ) + ( -q n d^1+pd^2 ) , the hamiltonian is invariant under that change . @xmath61 and @xmath62 are now the winding numbers of the supermembrane . given @xmath61 there always exist @xmath63 and @xmath64 with the above property , although the correspondence is not unique .",
    "the @xmath60 type iib strings may indeed be interpreted as different wrappings of the supermembrane with central charges .",
    "this nice interpretation was first given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath60 @xmath65 string compactified on a circle of radius @xmath66 has tension @xcite t_(p , q)^2=t^2 where @xmath67 is the string tension and @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 identified with the scalar fields of the type iib theory , @xmath70 corresponds to the dilaton fields .",
    "@xmath71 is the asymptotic value of @xmath72 -the axion - dilaton of the type iib theory- specifying the vacuum of the theory .",
    "the perturbative spectrum of the @xmath60 iib string is @xcite , [ 82 ] m_b^2=()^2+(2r_bm t_(p , q))^2 + 4t_(p , q ) ( n_l+n_r ) .if we use following @xcite a factor @xmath73 to identify term by term both mass formulas ( @xmath74 ) , since there were obtained using different metrics , one gets [ 83 ] = _ 0,^2= , r_b^-2= t t_11 a_11 ^ 3/2 . they were obtained by counting modes under some assumptions on the supermembrane wrapping modes , as mentioned on one of the footnotes @xcite .",
    "here we have derived the expressions from a consistent definition of the supermembrane with central charges .",
    "the identification of ( [ 78 ] ) to the mass formula of iia string compactified on a circle of radius @xmath75 and tension @xmath76 may also be performed . in order to have a consistent identification one has to take @xmath77 , @xmath78 and",
    "hence @xmath79 in ( [ 78 ] ) .",
    "the mass formula for the perturbative spectrum of type iia is m_a^2=()^2+(2r_an t_a)^2 + 4t_a ( n_l+n_r ) identification after the limit process of the winding contributions and kk ones using a factor @xmath80 to compare the @xmath81 formulas , since they are obtained using different metrics , yields @xmath82 which imply ( 2r_ar_b)=()^1/2 we have thus obtained the @xmath60 iib and iia perturbative spectrum , when compactified on circles @xmath66 and @xmath75 respectively , from the string states on the supermembrane with central charges . in this limit , by restricting the worldvolume configurations of the m2 to those of the string @xcite , we exactly recover the mass operator of the iib theory as was formerly conjectured by schwarz .",
    "the gain is that from the supermembrane with central charges the pure membrane excitations are known .",
    "if now a t - duality is performed on the supermembrane m2 mass operator restricted to string - like configurations , then an sl(2,z ) non - perturbative multiplet of iia is obtained @xcite .",
    "[ [ string - t - duality - transformation - limit . ] ] string t - duality transformation limit .",

    "the coordinates that wrap on the @xmath3 .",
    "we take @xmath85 such that the lie brackets @xmath86 will remain invariant under the redefinition .",
    "now we consider the following limit for the torus collapsing into a circle , by imposing @xmath87 .",
    "since we want to ensure @xmath88 remains finite but @xmath89 , necessarily @xmath79 , for arbitrary @xmath90 . indeed this is equivalent to consider the kk charges @xmath91 for @xmath92 . by using the m2 t - duality transformation",
    "it can also be seen that @xmath93 , so the dual also corresponds to a string .",
    "moreover substituting in the previous definitions it can be seen @xmath94 is finite implies @xmath95 finite .",
    "we will define the following for the torus degenerating into a circle @xmath96 r_1= ; r_2=r_11 ^ 3/2t_11 ^ 1/6 i m    since @xmath97 , it implies @xmath98 but @xmath99 is finite , so it corresponds to a closed curve that topologically is a circle .",
