    "quantum computation and quantum information have been amongst the most popular branches of physics in the last decade @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons of this success is that the smallest unit of quantum information , the qubit , could be reliably encoded in photons that are easy to manipulate and virtually free from decoherence at optical frequencies @xcite .",
    "thus , recently , there has been a growing interest in quantum information processing with linear optics @xcite and several techniques to generate and manipulate optical qubits have been developed for different purposes ranging from , e.g. , teleportation @xcite , to quantum cryptography @xcite , to quantum measurements of qubits states @xcite and processes @xcite , etc .",
    "in particular , kwiat and coworkers @xcite were able to create and characterize arbitrary one- and two - qubit states , using polarization and frequency modes of photons generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",
    "manipulation of optical qubits is performed by means of linear optical instruments such as half- and quarter - wave plates , beam splitters , polarizers , mirrors , etc . , and networks of these elements .",
    "each of these devices can be thought as an object where incoming modes of the electromagnetic fields are turned into outgoing modes by a _ linear _ transformation . from a quantum information perspective",
    ", this transforms the state of qubits encoded in some degrees of freedom of the incoming photons , according to a completely positive map @xmath0 describing the action of the device .",
    "thus , an optical instrument may be put in correspondence with a quantum map and vice versa .",
    "such correspondence has been largely exploited @xcite and stressed @xcite by several authors . moreover , classical physics of linear optical devices is a textbook matter @xcite , and quantum physics of elementary optical instruments has been studied extensively @xcite , as well .",
    "however , surprisingly enough , a systematic exposition of the connection between classical linear optics and quantum maps is still lacking . in this paper",
    "we aim to fill this gap by presenting a detailed theory of linear optical instruments from a quantum information point of view .",
    "specifically , we establish a rigorous basis of the connection between quantum maps describing one- and two - qubit physical processes operated by polarization - affecting optical instruments , and the classical matrix formalism of polarization optics .",
    "moreover , we will use this connection to interpret some recent experiments in our group @xcite .",
    "we begin in section ii by reviewing the classical theory of polarization - affecting linear optical devices .",
    "then , in section iii we show how to pass , in a natural manner , from classical polarization - affecting optical operations to one - qubit quantum processes .",
    "such passage is extended to two - qubit quantum maps in section iv . in section",
    "v we furnish two explicit applications of our classical-_vs_-quantum formalism that illustrate its utility . finally , in section v we summarize our results and draw the conclusions .",
    "in this section we focus our attention on the description of non - image - forming polarization - affecting optical devices .",
    "first , we shortly review the mathematical formalism of classical polarization optics and establish a proper notation .",
    "second , we introduce the concepts of jones and mueller matrices as classical maps .      many textbooks on classical optics introduce the concept of polarized and unpolarized light with the help of the jones and stokes - mueller calculi , respectively @xcite . in these calculi , the description of classical polarization of light is formally identical to the quantum description of pure and mixed states of two - level systems , respectively @xcite . in the jones calculus , the electric field of a quasi - monochromatic _ polarized _ beam of light which propagates close the @xmath1-direction ,",
    "is represented by a complex - valued two - dimensional vector , the so - called _ jones vector _ @xmath2 , where the three real - valued unit vectors @xmath3 define an orthogonal cartesian frame . the same amount of information about the state of the field is also contained in the @xmath4 matrix @xmath5 of components @xmath6 , which is known as the _ coherency matrix _ of the beam @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath5 is hermitean and positive semidefinite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denotes the ordinary scalar product in @xmath10 .",
    "further , @xmath5 has the projection property @xmath11 and its trace equals the total intensity of the beam : @xmath12 . if we choose the electric field units in such a way that @xmath13 , then @xmath5 has the same properties of a _ density matrix _ representing a two - level quantum system in a _",
    "pure _ state . in classical polarization optics",
    "the coherency matrix description of a light beam has the advantage , with respect to the jones vector representation , of generalizing to the concept of _ partially polarized _ light .",
    "formally , the coherency matrix of a partially polarized beam of light is characterized by the properties ( [ eq10 ] ) , while the projection property ( [ eq12 ] ) is lost . in this case",
    "@xmath5 has the same properties of a density matrix representing a two - level quantum system in a _",
    "mixed _ state .",
    "coherency matrices of partially polarized beams of light may be obtained by tacking linear combinations @xmath14 of coherency matrices @xmath15 of polarized beams ( all parallel to the same direction @xmath1 ) , where the index @xmath16 runs over an _ ensemble _ of field configurations and @xmath17 .",
    "the degree of polarization ( dop , denoted @xmath18 ) of a partially polarized beam is defined by the relation @xmath19 for a polarized beam of light , projection property ( [ eq12 ] ) implies @xmath20 and @xmath21 , otherwise @xmath22 .",
    "it should be noted that the off - diagonal elements of the coherency matrix are complex - valued and , therefore , not directly observables .",

    "_ @xcite of the beam , can be actually measured thus relating @xmath5 with observables of the optical field . for example",
    ", @xmath33 represents the total intensity of the beam .",
    "conversely , the four complex coefficients @xmath34 are not directly measurable but have the advantage to furnish a particularly simple representation of the matrix @xmath5 since @xmath35 .",

    "when a beam of light passes through an optical system its state of polarization may change . within the context of polarization optics , a polarization - affecting linear optical istrument is any device that performs a _ linear _ transformation upon the electric field components of an incoming light beam without affecting the spatial modes of the field .",
    "half- and quarter - wave plates , phase shifters , polarizers , are all examples of such devices .",
    "the class of polarization - affecting linear optical elements comprises both non - depolarizing and depolarizing devices . roughly speaking , a _",
    "non - depolarizing _ linear optical element transforms a polarized input beam into a polarized output beam . on the contrary , a _ depolarizing _ linear optical element transforms a polarized input beam into a partially polarized output beam @xcite .",
    "a non - depolarizing device may be represented by a classical map via a single @xmath4 complex - valued matrix @xmath42 , the _ jones matrix _ @xcite , such that @xmath43 for polarized input beams or , for light beams with arbitrary degree of polarization : @xmath44 in this paper we consider only _ passive _ ( namely , non - amplifying ) optical devices for which the relation @xmath45 holds .",
    "there exist two fundamental kinds of non - depolarizing optical elements , namely _ retarders _ and _ diattenuators _ ; any other non - depolarizing element can be modelled as a retarder followed by a diattenuator @xcite . a retarder ( also known as _",
    "element ) changes the _ phases _ of the two components of the electric - field vector of a beam , and may be represented by a unitary jones matrix @xmath46 . a diattenuator ( also known as _ dichroic _",

    "( [ eq20 ] , [ eq28 ] ) it readily follows that we can indifferently represent the transformation operated by @xmath48 either in the standard or in the pauli basis as @xmath62 respectively . with respect to the jones matrix @xmath42 , the mueller matrices @xmath58 and @xmath59 have the advantage of generalizing to the representation of _ depolarizing _ optical elements .",

    "an important theorem in classical polarization optics states that any linear optical element ( either deterministic or stochastic ) is equivalent to a composite device made of at most four non - depolarizing elements in parallel @xcite .",
