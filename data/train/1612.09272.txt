    "the classic black hole thermodynamics @xcite relates the mass @xmath1 , surface gravity @xmath2 , and outer horizon area @xmath3 of a black hole solution to the energy , temperature , and entropy ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , resp . ) according to have been set to unity . ] : @xmath7 the formalism has been extended by allowing the cosmological constant of the theory to be dynamical , supplying a pressure _ via _",
    "@xmath8 , along with its conjugate volume @xmath9 .",
    "now , the black hole mass is related to the enthalpy @xmath10 of the system instead of the energy @xmath4@xcite : @xmath11 .",
    "the first law now reads as : @xmath12 the temperature and the entropy remain related to the surface gravity and area of the black hole as in equations  ( [ oldtd ] ) .",
    "the @xmath13 are gauge charges , and @xmath14 are angular momenta , while @xmath15 and  @xmath16 are their conjugate potentials and angular velocities , respectively .",
    "the black holes may have other parameters and they enter additively with their conjugates to the first law ( [ newtd ] ) in the usual way .",
    "this formalism works in multiple dimensions .",
    "interestingly , for the static black holes , the thermodynamic volume @xmath9 is just the naive `` geometric '' volume of the black holes : the volume of the ball of radius @xmath17 ( our notation for the horizon radius in this paper ) .      in this",
    "_ extended _ black hole thermodynamics , since the pressure and volume are now in play , alongside temperature and entropy ( [ newtd ] ) , it is natural to study devices which can extract useful mechanical work from heat energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , traditional heat engines@xcite .",
    "these devices were named `` holographic heat engines '' , since for negative cosmological constant ( _ i.e. _ with positive pressure , since @xmath18 ) such cycles represent a journey through a family of holographically dual@xcite non  gravitational field theories ( at large @xmath19 ) defined in one dimension fewer .",
    "although we have holographic applications in mind for some of this work , for this paper our focus will be on the black hole side of the story , an interesting context in its own right .",
    "so for the purposes of the gravitational theory , the working substance of the heat engine is a particular black hole solution of the gravity system .",
    "it supplies an equation of state through the relation between its temperature @xmath5 and the black hole parameters defined in the usual way ( we will give examples below ) .",
    "the precise form of all these relations depends on the type of black hole , and the parent theory of gravity under discussion .",
    "one may extract mechanical work from such an engine@xcite _ via _ the @xmath20 term in the first law of thermodynamics in the classic way : define a closed cycle in state space during which there is a net input heat flow @xmath21 , a    l0.4        net output heat flow @xmath22 , and a net output work @xmath23 .",
    "so @xmath24 .",
    "a central quantity , the efficiency for the cycle , is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "its value is sensitive to the details of the equation of state of the system and also to the choice of cycle in state space .",
    "consider the cycle given in figure  [ fig : prototype ] . in refs.@xcite",
    "it is explained why this is a natural choice for static black holes . for such holes ,",
    "the entropy and the volume are not independent , being both simple functions of @xmath26 , the horizon radius .",
    "so isochores are adiabats , and so the only heat flows are along the top and bottom lines .",
    "computing the efficiency boils down to evaluating @xmath27 along those isobars , where  @xmath28 is the specific heat at constant pressure . in general , calculation of efficiency",
    "is a difficult task to perform exactly using this approach , and high temperature or high pressure computations are used to get approximate results@xcite .",
    "recently , however , ref .",
    "@xcite showed a much simpler way to evaluate the efficiency .",
    "the first law is : @xmath29 and along the isobars , @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the total heat flow along an isobar is simply the enthalpy change .",
    "normally , that might not be a useful rewriting , but in extended gravitational thermodynamics , a precise expression for the enthalpy is readily available since it is just the black hole mass  @xmath1 .",
    "this results in a remarkably simple exact formula : @xmath31 where the black hole mass is evaluated at each corner of the rectangle , with the labelling given in figure  [ fig : prototype ] .",
    "@xmath1 is usually written as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath32 . in the examples of this paper ,",
    "since @xmath9 is a simple function of @xmath17 , we will be easily able to write down @xmath1 as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath9 .",
    "it was also shown in ref.@xcite that the result ( [ simplemass ] ) can be used as the basis for an algorithm for computing the efficiency of a cycle of _ arbitrary _ shape to any desired accuracy . any closed shape on the state space",
    "can be approximated by tiling with a regular lattice of rectangles .",
    "r0.4        this is possible because cycles are additive ( see figure  [ fig : addlaw ] ) .",
    "consequently , only the cells at the edge contribute .",
    "any mismatch between the edge of the cycle s contour and the tiling s edge can be reduced by simply shrinking the size of the unit cell .",
    "edge cells are called hot cells if they have their upper edges open , and cold cells if they have their lower edges open .",
    "summing all the hot cell mass differences ( evaluated at the top edges ) will give @xmath21 and summing all the cold cell mass differences ( evaluated at the bottom edges ) will yield @xmath22 . so the efficiency is : @xmath33 where we have labelled all cells corners in the same way as the prototype cycle in figure  [ fig : prototype ] .",
    "an example with a triangular cycle was given in @xcite to show the algorithm in action supporting the previous argument .",
    "as already stated , a given black hole , thought of as a working substance for a heat engine , supplies a particular equation of state .",
    "the efficiency will depend upon this choice .",
    "moreover , the efficiency will also depend upon the details of the choice of cycle . for maximizing @xmath34 ,",
    "certain choices of cycle will be better adapted to a particular working substance ( choice of black hole ) than others .",
    "( for example , for the same cycle of figure  [ fig : prototype ] , a non - static black hole will generically have a larger @xmath35 due to non  zero heat flows along the isochores , and therefore a smaller @xmath34 . )",
    "so a natural question arises : how does one compare the efficiency of different working substances ?",
    "we have in mind a comparison that depends as little as possible on special choices of cycle .",
    "in other words , in comparing working substances for making a heat engine , we should _ not _ choose a special cycle that favours one black hole s particular properties over another .",
    "notice that this requirement requires us to make a choice that is in opposition to what is normally done : cycles are usually chosen in a way that is naturally adapted to the equation of state in order to simplify computation .",
    "so we are asking that a more difficult choice of cycle be made , by necessity .",
    "this is where the exact formula and algorithm reviewed above come in .",
    "we can pick a benchmark cycle of whatever shape seems appropriate and implement the algorithm to compute @xmath34 to any desired accuracy .",
    "this freedom allows us to make the following choice of benchmark : we choose the cycle to be a _ circle _ in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the logic of this choice is that the circle is a simply parametrised shape which is also unlikely to favour _ any _ species of black hole ( working substance ) whatsoever . no thermodynamic variable is unchanged on any segment of the cycle , so it is , in some sense , a difficult cycle for all black holes .",
    "all that needs be specified is the origin of the circle and its radius .",
    "these properties make it an excellent choice of benchmark .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : circle ]",
    ", we set up the circular cycle as our benchmarking tool , and explain our implementation of the exact formula and algorithm of ref.@xcite for calculating the efficiency .",
    "we then discuss , in section  [ sec : ideal ] , a very special case of working substance : an  ideal gas \" like system .",
    "it allows us to derive some exact results that help test our implementation , and which also set a new benchmark standard for later use . in section [ sec : comparison ] , we compare three examples of black holes as working substances for heat engines : charged ( reissner  nordstrom  like ) black holes , gauss  bonnet black holes , and born  infeld black holes .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with a brief discussion of future applications of our benchmarking procedure .",
    "for our circle , we implemented the algorithm and exact formula of ref.@xcite , with the aid of a computer , as follows : imagine that we have chosen the origin and radius , @xmath36 , of the circle in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we next overlaid it onto the @xmath37 regular lattice of squares of total side length @xmath38 . for simplicity , we used even @xmath39 so that there are same number of squares both in the upper half and in the lower half of the circle . next we computed the pressure and volume at each corner of all the squares . using simple geometry ,",
    "we determined which squares intersect the circle .",
    "we checked for cases where two squares share a common isobar and both intersect the circle .",
    "then , if we are in the upper part of the circle , we remove the one below and keep only the upper square .",
    "we did this check in the lower half of the circle in a similar fashion .",
    "this allowed us to identify all the hot cells and cold cells of the approximation , and their @xmath40 coordinates .",
    "the black hole mass is a function of pressure @xmath32 and volume @xmath9 only ( with some parameters that we have already fixed ) , so we can compute its value at each corner .",
    "then we use the formula ( [ fullmass ] ) to give us the approximate  @xmath34 for that level of granularity . increasing the value of @xmath39",
    "makes the size of the unit cell smaller , making the path traced by the hot and cold cells a better fit to our circle , reducing the error in @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , we found that just as for the triangle prototype of ref.@xcite , the efficiency converges nicely for large  @xmath39 .",
    "( see the examples in section  [ sec : comparison ] . )",
    "( 100 squares ) .",
    "red lines are the tops of hot cells and blue lines are the bottoms of cold cells .",
    "as @xmath39 increases , these lines converge to the boundary of the circle .",
    "the dashed black lines are sample isotherms.,width=336 ]    we can even do more . since temperature is also a function of @xmath32 and @xmath9 , we can compute it at each corner . then while we run over all the cells to compute @xmath34 , we can keep track of the maximum and the minimum temperatures ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) achieved in the entire cycle .",
    "hence , we can compute the carnot efficiency @xmath43 for this engine .",
    "this will be a check of our results because no cycle can have a greater efficiency than a carnot cycle .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccn10 ] shows an example for @xmath44 .",
    "the green crosses show the points of the square lattice .",
    "the circle is our circular cycle .",
    "red segments are the tops of the hot cells and blue segments are the bottoms of cold cells .",
    "the black dashed lines show a few sample isotherms determined from the underlying equation of state of the system in question .",
    "( this example is a snapshot of the einstein  hilbert ",
    "maxwell case more fully explored in section  [ ehm ] ) .    in choosing our benchmark cycle to compare different black holes",
    ", we should fix the circle origin and radius @xmath36 .",
    "generically , the choices do nt matter , as long as they are the same across the comparison .",
    "we chose @xmath45 here , and in the following sections , purely arbitrarily , except for making sure that we avoided any regions where the equations of state of the black holes under comparison had any multi  valuedness that would signal non  trivial phase transitions@xcite .",
    "such regimes require a separate , more careful study in this heat engine context that are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "one might worry that since the circular cycle is presumably not even close to a cycle for which one has an analytically computable result , if there was an error , it might not be noticed .",
    "the carnot test above is useful , but it is a rather weak upper bound on the efficiency .",
    "we derive some complementary tests , and a stronger ( exact ) bound , in the next section .",
    "before we proceed to study some black hole examples we briefly pause to study a simple but instructive case .",
    "it is in fact a limiting form of all of the black hole solutions we ll discuss shortly . as discussed in ref.@xcite it deserves to be called an ideal gas case , and as such , sets an additional standard by which we might assess other working substances . in dimension @xmath46 ,",
    "the leading large horizon radius ( @xmath26 ) limit of all the asymptotically anti ",
    "de sitter black holes we will discuss is rather simple , with dependence for the mass and temperature as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the volume ( _ i.e. , _ surface area ) of the unit round @xmath49 sphere .",
    "the exact thermodynamic volume for all of the static black holes under study is : @xmath50 and so we have the familiar  ideal gas \" behaviour in this large @xmath26 limit : @xmath51 a family of hyperbolae in the @xmath52 plane where @xmath53 . this ideal gas can be obtained as a limit for any of our black holes ( in later sections ) as either a large @xmath26 limit or as a high temperature limit . before moving on to those cases",
    ", we can study this in its own right , taking the above as the equation of state everywhere in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "notice first that the efficiency of any cell such as the prototype of figure  [ fig : prototype ] simplifies nicely in this case .",
    "this is because the mass is simply @xmath54 , and hence @xmath32 factors out in each mass difference , leaving only a volume difference .",
    "so @xmath34 for figure  [ fig : prototype ] is just@xcite @xmath55 .    turning to the efficiency of the circle",
    ", the factorization into sums of volume differences means that there is no dependence of the result on the volume coordinate of the circle s origin : any shift in the origin will cancel out everywhere .",
    "we can say even more in this case however .",
    "in fact , the terms in the sums in the algorithm  ( [ fullmass ] ) are actually entirely geometrical in interpretation ! for example , for a hot cell a term is of the form @xmath56 .",
    "this is simply the area of the rectangular strip that starts on the @xmath9 axis and is bounded above by the top of the cell .",
    "this is a clue to writing an _ exact _",
    "formula for the efficiency in the case of our ideal gas .",
    "the simplest way to do it is to rewrite @xmath34 as the ratio of work to heat flowing in , @xmath57 .",
    "now @xmath58 while from our observation above , @xmath35 is , in the large @xmath39 limit , exactly the area underneath the upper semi  circle of the circular path : @xmath59 , so our result is : @xmath60 where @xmath32 is the pressure at the centre of the circle .",
    "this exact formula is rather surprising .",
    "notably , in addition to being independent of @xmath9 it is also independent of spacetime dimension , but the real surprise is that the algorithm assembled itself into a purely geometric result that yielded an exact formula for what is , on the face of it , a difficult shape of cycle .",
    "in fact , this exact geometrical result will work for _ any cycle shape_. perhaps there can be other surprises of this sort for other systems besides this special ideal gas case .",
    "the formula is also a rather useful check on our methods for a number of reasons .",
    "the first is that the @xmath32 and @xmath36 dependence are non  trivial predictions , and so we were obliged to check to see if our discrete algorithm reproduces such dependence , and indeed it did .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : effrad ] shows , for @xmath61 , some example points computed by inserting the ideal gas into our algorithm .",
    "the red curve is the exact result of equation  ( [ eq : idealgasefficiency ] ) .    .",
    "the ideal gas ( see text ) equation of state was used in the algorithm for @xmath61 with the circle origin at @xmath62 , and radius @xmath63 .",
    "the blue crosses plot the result for @xmath34 .",
    "the red curve is a plot of the exact result from equation  ( [ eq : idealgasefficiency]).,width=240 ]    the second reason this is a strong check is that it presents a lower upper bound on our results than the upper bound given by carnot ( discussed in the previous section ) . our black holes , in the regions where we study them ,",
    "can be thought of as perturbations of this ideal gas case , and so we should expect that the efficiencies we obtain approach ( but do not exceed ) the ideal gas result .",
    "we have , for the comparisons to come , the circle s origin at @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and its radius as @xmath63 , for which the ideal gas efficiency is ( to six significant figures ) @xmath66 .",
    "it is worth noting that using the discretisation algorithm to compute the ideal gas case gives @xmath67 at @xmath61 and @xmath68 at @xmath69 .",
    "( moving significantly beyond @xmath69 to see further convergence proved beyond the numerical capabilities of the system we were using . )",
    "we now apply our benchmark cycle to a sampling of different black holes acting as working substances .",
    "we will only briefly introduce the black holes since they are well known in the literature .",
    "they were used in heat engines in refs.@xcite , with some analysis and comparison presented there , but now we have a clearer , more systematic benchmarking procedure .",
    "we will work in @xmath70 for definiteness ( it is trivial to insert the formulae for other dimensions into our algorithm ; we saw no compelling reason to present the results for other dimensions here ) , and our benchmark circle will be centred at @xmath64 , @xmath65 , with radius @xmath63 . in each case",
    "we list the bulk action in @xmath70 dimensions and the mass and temperature of the black hole . for static black holes",
    "the volume @xmath9 is simply : @xmath71 . also , recall that the cosmological constant  @xmath72 is related to pressure @xmath32 _ via _",
    "@xmath18 , and in @xmath46 dimensions @xmath72 sets a length scale  @xmath73 through  @xmath74 .",
    "so in @xmath70 dimensions , @xmath75 .",
    "the mass and temperature formulae we present will have had @xmath73 eliminated in favour of @xmath32 .",
    "note that in presenting our results for the efficiency , the engine s actual efficiency will be denoted by @xmath34 ( without a subscript ; the surrounding text will make it clear which case is being discussed ) and the associated carnot efficiency will be denoted @xmath76 ( again with context making it clear as to which case is being discussed ) .",
