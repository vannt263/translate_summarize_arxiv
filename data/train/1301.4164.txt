    "the metallic alloy ferh undergoes an uncommon phase transition at t@xmath0c . here the magnetic order upon heating changes from antiferromagnetic ( afm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) while the lattice simultaneously expands by @xmath1.@xcite as the transition is first order it involves a latent heat and phase coexistence of the afm and fm states .",
    "the value of t@xmath2 above room temperature is attractive for technological applications and has lead to proposed uses in thermally assisted magnetic recording@xcite , magnetocaloric refrigiration@xcite and magnetostrictive transduction@xcite . for any application utilizing the phase transition of ferh an improved understanding of the dynamics and the phase coexistence is of interest .",
    "the phase transition also provides an opportunity to study the general phenomena of phase coexistence in a first order magnetic phase transition .",

    "while the electronic structure is largely unaffected by the transition in both bulk crystals@xcite and thin films,@xcite the heat capacity , entropy and electrical resistance all change at t@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the exact transition temperature depends on both composition@xcite and the addition of transition metal impurities@xcite , which complicates comparison between different experiments .",
    "though the afm to fm phase transition has been known since 1939 @xcite the physical mechanism behind it is still debated .",
    "the first simple empirical model proposed historically assumed a change of sign of the fe - fe interaction as a function of the lattice expansion but failed to explain the experimental work , especially the large change in entropy during the transition @xcite . on the other hand density functional theory ( dft ) computations reproduce the existence of the afm and fm phases and the volume dependency of the lattice constant @xcite .",
    "the low energy difference ( @xmath70.2  mry / atom ) between the afm and fm phases could be explained by considering the effect of spin waves @xcite and recent local dft work indicate that the volume dependence of the afm fe - fe exchange interaction combined with the unaffected fm fe - rh interaction play a crucial role for the physical properties of ferh .",

    "the net moment in the images is essentially zero , as expected when no external field was applied to the sample .",
    "the rotation of the sample by 180@xmath8 from  [ figure1a]a to c results in a reversal of contrast from black to white and vice versa , as highlighted by the black circles and evident throughout the images .",
    "this indicates in - plane magnetic domains because out - of - plane domains do not change contrast upon rotation of the sample .",

    "this is highlighted for a single feature by the white circles in  [ figure1a]a - c .",

    "one example is shown in the lower insert in the figure . here",
    "the azimuthal angle is taken along the contour shown as a white circle in  [ figure1a]d , and the 0 to 360@xmath8 degree rotation is evident . as a consequence",
    "there must be an out - of - plane divergence but these vortex cores are too small to be resolved .",
    "previously reported domain patterns for ferh polycrystalline bulk samples@xcite were likely caused by dipolar interaction between the grains , a feature which is not present in our epitaxial film .",
    "the reconstruction of the three dimensional magnetization vector allows us to determine if the film has preferred directions of the local magnetic moments . in  [ figure1b ]",
    "we show histograms of the three spherical coordinates of * m * : the moment magnitude @xmath26 , the out - of - plane inclination angle @xmath25 and in - plane azimuth angle @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath25 lies in the range from 0 to @xmath27 with 0 corresponding to the magnetic moment lying along the surface normal and @xmath28 being in - plane .",
    "the magnitude of the moment shows one major peak , but is significantly broadened towards zero , because we do not have the resolution to image domain walls . due to this areas of the sample where the direction of the local magnetic moment changes on a scale shorter than the peem resolution will then be measured as having a smaller magnitude of the moment .",
    "the histogram of the out - of - plane angle @xmath25 has a clear peak at @xmath28 , confirming the in - plane magnetization which is also visible from the raw images in  [ figure1a ] .",
    "for the azimuth angle @xmath9 we find a fairly uniform distribution while a strong anisotropy in the plane would give well defined domains and reveal itself as distinct peaks in the histogram .",
    "the absence of such peaks indicates that ferh has a very low magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "we are not aware of a measurement of the anisotropy constant k for ferh , but our result supports the assumption that k is small for ferh.@xcite    from the presence of two peaks in a histogram of the asymmetry of a single xmcd image @xcite concluded that their ferh film had a four fold anisotropy .",
    "however , since the asymmetry for an in - plane magnetized surface is proportional to @xmath29 an isotropic distribution of azimuth angles also results in two peaks in the histogram of the asymmetry . based on our azimuthal study of the magnetization vector",
    "we conclude in contrast to ref .",
    "28 that the crystalline anisotropy is too weak to give a well defined 4 fold easy axis in ferh .",
    "it has also been suggested that the tetragonal distortion imposed by the substrate leads to a magnetocrystalline anisotropy favoring out - of - plane magnetization of the fm phase , when the ratio between the lattice constants satisfy @xmath30 as for our sample.@xcite the shape anisotropy was however estimated to be several times larger than the magnetocrystalline anisotropy for a 150  nm film and our results clearly show that the film is 100% in - plane magnetized .",
    "this shows that the proposed magnetocrystalline anisotropy if present is too weak to overcome to the shape anisotropy of our 50  nm thin film .",
    "having established the ability to map fm domain structures we now discuss the afm to fm phase transition and the phase coexistence . in  [ figure3 ]",
    "we show images taken as the sample was cooled ( upper row ) and heated ( lower row ) through the afm to fm transition .",
    "the images in  [ figure3 ] show a different region of the sample than the images in  [ figure1a ] .",
    "the feature consisting of two straight lines which cross in the upper right corner of each image appears to be a scratch on the sample surface , and was used to monitor the drift of the sample . in the following we refer to each image in  [ figure3 ] by the temperature at which it was obtained .",
    "we first focus on the heating process . in the afm phase ( t = 82@xmath8c and t = 88@xmath8c ) no domain structure is visible , because the afm phase does not show any xmcd .",
    "the growth of the fm phase in the afm matrix then proceeds through the nucleation of many independent domains on a sub micron length - scale ( t = 103@xmath8c ) .",
    "this directly shows the coexistence of the two magnetic phases expected for a first order phase transition at intermediate temperatures . as the temperature",
    "is increased ( t = 107@xmath8c ) the dominant feature remains nucleation of new domains rather than growth of previously nucleated domains . like the final domain pattern in  [ figure1a ] the initially nucleated domains have no preferred in - plane magnetization directions .",
    "as the film reaches a purely fm state neighboring domains to some extent realign upon contact ( t = 116@xmath8c ) .",
    "this is evident in  [ figure3b ] where the initial black contrast of the circled feature changes to white .",
    "the result is in the final structure which as already observed is dominated by domains of size @xmath31 ( t = 125@xmath8c ) .",
    "once the transition reaches this state the domain structure is unchanged upon further heating .",
    "one example of this nucleation process is highlighted in  [ figure3b ] which shows a magnification of a @xmath32 area corresponding to the square in  [ figure3 ] ( t = 125@xmath8c ) . at t",
    "= 103@xmath8c several independent fm domains are visible and in several cases positive ( white ) and negative ( black ) dichroism are paired .",
    "this indicates that the independent fm domains form closed magnetic loops in order to minimize the stray field . as the temperature",
    "is raised these smaller structures change or grow to larger domains .",
    "[ figure3 ] and  [ figure3b ] show how the afm to fm transition proceeds through the nucleation of many independent unaligned domains , and subsequent partial reorientation of neighboring domains .",
    "this observation agrees with the recent work by @xcite and with our previous results where we have found the same mechanism to dominate the phase transition when it is induced with a fs laser pulse.@xcite we find the same nucleation dynamics on both ps and s timescales , suggesting that also the laser induced phase transition is a thermal process .",
    "the white circle highlights a small fm domain with an apparently closed magnetization loop.,title=\"fig : \" ]    because we can only image the fm domains the observed process during cooling is slightly different from heating . in this case",
    "we observe how the fm domains disappear , rather than how the afm phase nucleates in the fm matrix . in  [ figure3 ]",
    "we see how the fm domains upon cooling first start to shrink ( t = 97@xmath8  c ) and eventually break up ( t = 95@xmath8  c ) into independent domains .",
    "the result is again a process where the final coexistence of the afm and fm phase consists of many small sub - micron size fm domains ( t = 93@xmath8  c ) in an afm matrix .",
    "this process is similar to heating , but there is less realignment of the fm domains . to quantify this difference",
    "we define realignment as a change in sign of dichroism and determine the number of pixels which change sign at some point during heating ( cooling ) . in this case",
    "the fraction of the film which realign is 14% during heating and 7% during cooling .",
    "we stress that this definition of realignment is a simplification and that the actual fraction of the film which realigns is higher .",
    "the images in  [ figure3 ] taken at t = 109@xmath8c and t = 125@xmath8c were obtained before and after cooling to the afm phase . when comparing the two images the two domain structures appear to be independent .",
    "to quantify this we again sort pixels according to whether they show positive or negative dichroism , and compare how many pixels are positive in both images .",
    "we find a fraction of 0.26 , which is practically identical to the 0.25 expected if there was no correlation between the domains in the two images .",
    "a comparison of images during the late stages of cooling ( t = 93@xmath8  c ) and early stages of heating ( t = 103@xmath8  c ) however reveal a statistical significant correlation of the fm regions .",
    "of the sample is fm , while 7% of the sample is fm in both images .",
    "this is more than 3 standard deviations higher than the overlap found in a numerical simulation where a 19% fm area was chosen randomly in two images and then compared . ]",
    "that is , on average the regions which nucleate first during heating also retain the fm states longest during cooling .",
    "the magnetization direction is however not correlated in the two images which again shows that the film has no memory of the previous fm phase .",
    "this rules out the existence of a single unique pathway between the afm and fm domain patterns .",
    "[ t ]   during cooling ( blue circles ) and heating ( red squares ) .",
    "a domain is defined as a connected area with either positive or negative dichroism .",
    "( b ) the total area of the fm domains .",
    "the insert show the domain structure corresponding to  [ figure3 ] t = 125c .",
    "( c ) in - plane ( blue triangles ) and out - of - plane ( red squares ) expansion of the lattice .",
    "( d ) volume fractions of the fm ( red squares ) and afm ( blue triangles ) phases obtained during heating.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to obtain a more quantitative understanding of the phase transition the images in  [ figure3 ] were analyzed as follows .",
    "due to the low magnetocrystalline anisotropy it is not possible to identify domains by the strength of the asymmetry .",
    "in addition the xmcd contrast is significantly weaker at the early stages of the nucleation , which complicates the comparison of domains at different temperatures .",
    "instead we define a domain as a connected area of pixels with either positive or negative dichroism .",
    "this is not a precise definition because it depends upon sample orientation (  [ figure1a ] ) , but it allows us to identify the appearing fm nuclei and quantify their number and sizes as well as the total fm area .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in  [ figure4 ] .",
    "[ figure4]a shows the number of individual domains as a function of temperature for both heating and cooling , while  [ figure4]b shows the fm fraction of the film .",
    "the final fm fraction only reaches 0.8 because we do not measure domains with a magnetic moment perpendicular to the x - ray beam which have no magnetic contrast . in reality",
    "the entire film is in the fm phase .",
    "the quantitative analysis presented in  [ figure4 ] support the qualitative interpretation of the images in  [ figure3 ] .",
    "the peak seen at intermediate temperatures in  [ figure4]a confirms that the nucleation proceeds through an initially large number of domains which later realign resulting in fewer domains .",
    "we note that the definition of a domain used in this analysis will underestimate the final number of domains according to the standard definition .",
    "we finally note that while a fm surface layer has previously been reported below t@xmath2 in the afm phase for both au , al and mgo capped ferh films @xcite we clearly observe no such fm surface layer for the uncapped sample studied here . though we will not discuss the subject further , we have observed fm surface layers on some uncapped films and imaged ferh films with 2  nm pt cap layer without a fm surface .",
    "the many different results thus seems to indicate that details in film growth and stoichiometry plays a bigger role in defining the magnetic surface properties than the choice of capping .",
    "the afm to fm phase transition in ferh has two connected components as the change in magnetic order goes hand in hand with a structural expansion . to complete the picture of the transition",
    "we show in  [ figure4]c the lattice expansion as a function of temperature .",
    "the shift in lattice constant @xmath33a can to first approximation be found from the shift in bragg peak position @xmath33q because @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to the thermal expansion , the out - of - plane lattice constant shows a clear shift of 0.7  % at t@xmath2 .",
    "the in - plane lattice constant only shows linear thermal expansion through the entire temperature range .",
    "the in - plane thermal expansion @xmath35 of the ferh film is close to the value for mgo ( @xmath36 at t = 300  k).@xcite the one dimensional expansion thus appears to be due to in - plane pinning to the mgo substrate .",
    "this difference from the isotropic expansion in bulk crystals has been reported previously.@xcite    in the diffraction experiment we measure the total diffraction from the two coexisting phases .",
    "the bragg peak measured during the phase - transition is a superposition of two peaks originating from the afm and fm phases respectively and can be decomposed into two peaks corresponding to the two phases@xcite . as the integrated intensity is proportional to the scattering volume the volume fraction of the afm and fm phase as a function of temperature",
    "can then be determined . in",
    "[ figure4]d we show the volume fractions of the afm and fm phase during the transition .",
    "we find agreement between the evolution of the fm structure and the magnetic order .",
    "the small differences in temperature is expected given the difference in how the temperature was changed and measured .",
    "the high resolution magnetic images obtained of the phase transition and the phase coexistence in ferh allows us to speculate about which microscopic mechanisms drive the phase transition . here",
    "three observations play a crucial role .",
    "first , the many independent nucleation sites present on a sub - micron length scale indicate that the driving mechanism must appear on a similar or smaller length scale .",
    "second , the correlation between images taken during cooling and heating show that there exist either pinning defects or local impurity fluctuations leading to local variations in transition temperature .",
    "third , the magnetization direction in the fm phase is not pinned neither for the final structure nor during nucleation .    concerning the existence of pinning",
    "centres our spatial resolution makes it difficult to discern between a transition that appears at topographic features such as defects or strain fields as suggested for the afm to fm transition in gd@xmath37ge@xmath38 @xcite or due to a broader but fixed local variation of the transition temperature such as suggested for ru doped cefe@xmath3 @xcite and the heusler alloy nimnin.@xcite clear topographic features such as the scratches visible in  [ figure3 ] or intentionally produced antidots ( not shown ) however do not dominate as nucleation centres .",
    "in addition rather than observing nucleation only at fixed sites we observe nucleation in all regions but at different temperatures .",
    "these two observations suggest that local impurity variations lead to changes in the volume free energy large enough to compensate for the interfaces created during phase coexistence.@xcite the resulting heterogenous nucleation was also observed in previous work on ferh .",
    "@xcite    the many independent nucleation sites could support the recent theoretical suggestion that local fluctuations in magnetic moment and/or volume acts as driving `` forces '' for the transition @xcite .",
    "the many independent nucleation sites then indicate a high attempt frequency and/or a low energy barrier for the transition .",
    "this can also explain the fact that the domain pattern is dominated by many small domains because the existence of many independent nucleation centers means that even a moderate domain wall coercivity will result in many small magnetic domains .",
    "we did not apply a magnetic field to the sample because an external magnetic field distorts the path of the photoelectrons and hereby reduces the resolution of the microscope . in an applied magnetic field",
    "it could be studied if the nucleated fm phase nucleate aligned to the field , align to the field immediately after nucleation or only after a full fm domain pattern is achieved .",
    "we have previously indirectly observed the latter case at fields of 0.1  t when the phase transition was induced by a fs laser@xcite .",
    "this question of alignment relates to the question of how the afm and fm domains are related to one another , if at all .",
    "a theoretical pathway has been used in calculations , where the fe moments rotate @xmath21 during the transformation from afm to fm @xcite . in this case",
    "an afm domain can give rise to four different directions of the magnetic moment in the fm phase . from our comparison of images taken at the late stages of cooling and early stages of heating",
    ", we confirm that there is no unique pathway between the afm and fm order .",
    "it was also calculated and shown for one film that the tetragonal crystal structure imposed on the film by the substrate leads to a magnetocrystalline anisotropy which strengthens this @xmath21 rotation of the moments.@xcite depending on the preferred magnetization direction this effect might however be negated by the shape anisotropy , as in our experiment . to verify a possible relation between the afm and fm domain structures an experimental probe of the afm domain structure",
    "is needed . these are scarce but one candidate could be x - ray linear magnetic dichroism@xcite . while this technique has been applied successfully to oxides",
    "only few studies of metallic systems exist .",
    "to summarize we used xmcd peem to measure the fm domain structure and xrd to confirm the structural changes of an epitaxial ferh thinfilm .",
    "the film was in - plane magnetized due to shape anisotropy and with no preferred in - plane direction of the magnetization , which indicates a low magnetocrystalline anisotropy .",
    "the resulting domain structure had a lengthscale of @xmath39 and the magnetic domains were not pinned when the film was repeatedly cycled through the transition .",
    "we directly observed the phase coexistence expected for a first order phase transition in the xmcd peem images , which are ideally suited to study this phenomenon .",
    "we found that the phase transition proceeds by nucleation at many small and independent sub - micron sized sites .",
    "this effect dominates over growth of already existing fm domains and neighboring domains only subsequently and to some extent realign to form the final fm domain pattern .",
    "these findings match our previously developed model for the laser induced phase transition@xcite and the existence of the same dynamics on ps and s timescale suggest that the laser induced phase transition is also a thermal process .",
    "a further understanding of the afm to fm pathway and the underlying driving forces could be obtained by imaging also the afm phase or by time - resolved xmcd peem .",
