    "entanglement entropy has been an intensively studied subject in the last few years , and indeed a primary role has been played by the well known formula for its holographic computation . given a fixed time codimension one submanifold @xmath2 , with its complement @xmath3 , and a density matrix @xmath4 , the entanglement entropy is defined to be the von neumann entropy for the reduced density matrix @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) is the hilbert space living on @xmath2 ( resp . @xmath3 ): @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "then , if we have a dual static euclidean background , @xcite proposed the formula @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the newton constant in the holographic @xmath11 dimensional space @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the minimal surface area inside @xmath12 , extending towards @xmath14 where the boundary @xmath15 is located , and such that @xmath16 .    not only this remarkable formula provides a relatively simple computational tool for @xmath17 , so far only possible at weak coupling using the replica trick for path integration , it also allowed many new developments in studying the properties of entanglement entropy .",
    "we may mention for example an alternative proof of the c - theorem and possible higher dimensional generalizations @xcite ; numerous achievements in reconstructing bulk and gravity properties from field theory data , for instance @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite , in particular enlightening the connection between gravity equations of motion and a sort of thermodynamic first law for entanglement entropy @xcite ( extended to a zeroth and second law in @xcite ) .",
    "further the ryu - takayanagi formula may be used to construct an incredibly simple proof of strong subadditivity @xcite , although its counterpart for time dependent backgrounds looks more tricky and deeply interconnected with the null energy condition @xcite , and for instance @xcite @xcite for the case of vaidya space .",
    "even if many consistency checks have been provided , a proof for this simple formula was so far lacking and has been searched for a few years ; a first proposal by fursaev @xcite was later discovered by @xcite to use gravitational solutions with conical singularities .",
    "later a proof was given at @xmath18 @xmath19 , by @xcite and @xcite , and for generic dimension but @xmath2 restricted to a sphere by @xcite .",
    "only recently the complete generalization was provided by @xcite , through the introduction of the concept of generalized gravitational entropy ( see @xcite for some comments ) .",
    "the proposed proof develops from the holographic correspondence between @xmath20 $ ] , with @xmath21 the non normalized time evolution operator @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and the exponential of a certain gravitational action @xmath24 @xmath25=e^{-s^{grav}_{eucl}(\\beta ) } , \\ ] ] with the following properties : first the new , regular background @xmath26 , on which the action is evaluated , contains a circle noncontractible on @xmath27 , along which a euclidean time coordinate @xmath28 runs .",
    "second , when @xmath29 , there are two periodicity conditions to be imposed on the fields @xmath30 entering @xmath24 : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "needs a priory to be defined only on @xmath27",
    ". we will however extend it to the full bulk .",
    "] third , if @xmath0 is analytically continued from integers to reals , so that the two periodic conditions are no longer compatible , only @xmath33 is preserved and the time integral for the action is redefined as @xmath34 . then we can compute the entropy for @xmath35 $ ] as @xmath36=\\partial_{\\beta}s^{grav}_{eucl}(\\beta)|_{\\beta=1}-s^{grav}_{eucl}(1)$ ] .",
    "now let us restrict to the boundary @xmath27 , and consider a codimension one submanifold @xmath2 at @xmath37 inside @xmath27 , with @xmath38 a different coordinate chosen to wind around ( not along ) @xmath39 .",
    "locally @xmath38 is the angle obtained by transforming @xmath40 and @xmath41 to polar coordinates @xmath42 , where @xmath43 span the space perpendicular to @xmath39 .",
    "as we wind around multiple times we are naturally implementing the replica trick used for the field theory computation of @xmath17 , that is instead of path integrating over a @xmath0-fold cover of the boundary space with cuts along @xmath2 , we compactify the time direction and go around @xmath0-times , with @xmath2 as a cauchy surface on @xmath27 .",
    "when we look for its holographic counterpart @xmath26 , we are led to the construction described in the above paragraph .     and",
    "@xmath43 on @xmath27 . on the right",
    "we show the radial additional direction of @xmath26 and the eventual shrinking of the circle parameterized by @xmath38 , somewhere in the interior ; because of its definition , contributes to @xmath44 come only from there.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    thus the ryu - takayanagi formula can be translated to a purely gravitational computation : @xmath45    one might wonder were does the time dependence on the left hand side of the above ( [ ass2 ] ) come from , if on the right hand side we are considering a static background ?",
    "in polar coordinates @xmath42 , the part of the regular metric at the boundary of @xmath27 spanning the plane perpendicular to @xmath46 , may be chosen to locally look like @xmath47 to avoid the proper length of the @xmath38-circle to shrink at zero at @xmath48 , we need to perform a bulk coordinate transformation such to induce a weyl rescaling on @xmath27 corresponding to a local multiplication by @xmath49 .",
    "if the shape of @xmath46 is generic , this can be done only at the price of introducing a time dependence in the rescaled metric .",
    "the intent of the present paper is to study in detail and explicitly check the assumption , made in @xcite , regarding the analytic continuation of @xmath0 for the gravitational solution @xmath26 , used to compute @xmath24 .",
    "although reasonable , it is in fact not the unique choice that could have been made , and we therefore think it is compelling to better understand it .",
    "one can of course follow a more pragmatic point of view and accept it by the a posteriori justification that it works , but this would then spoil the status of proof of the full construction .",
    "we will work perturbatively in the time dependent deformation of the static bulk metric .",
    "a second goal is then to construct a formalism for comparing minimal area to generalized gravitational entropies at first order , with particular care on the cutoff procedure ( that has so far been quite neglected in the literature ) and on the possible periodicity conditions for the gravitational solution .",
    "these techniques could then be applied to more general theories where the equivalent of a minimal area formula is not known , for example in order to study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy in these cases ; we will discuss it further in the conclusions .",
    "consider a weakly time dependent hamiltonian @xmath50 as we have discussed below equation [ ass2 ] , this would correspond to @xmath2 being a submanifold only marginally different from either half of the ads boundary or a sphere , cases for which the rescaled metric remains @xmath51independent .",
    "the problem is that this change of shape for @xmath46 makes difficult to compute minimal surfaces , even at first order in the deformation .",
    "another possibility for introducing weak time dependence is to consider the perturbed ads metric , with perturbations satisfying the linearized equations of motion ( and being in general time dependent ) , and @xmath2 remaining untouched .",
    "our @xmath26 will then be ads + first order perturbations , the nontrivial @xmath0 dependence contained inside these last ones and fixed by the periodicity conditions along the time direction that we will choose .",
    "we want to compare the generalized gravitational entropy on this background computed using different choices for the analytic continuation in @xmath0 , with the results from minimal area computation on the same background at @xmath52 .",
    "note that , even if for time dependent lorentzian manifolds the recipe is to look for extremal surfaces instead of minimal , @xcite , as we are at first order the shape of the extremal surface remains the same as in the unperturbed ads , and it then coincides with the minimal one , while its area will obviously be modified .",
    "the strategy will be as follows .",
    "first we will consider the analytic continuation in @xmath0 of @xmath20 $ ] from a purely field theoretical point of view , expanding the hamiltonian as in ( [ hami ] ) in order to show that , in principle , different possibilities arise and how to select the correct one .",
    "this will be done in section [ one ] . in section [ two ]",
    "we introduce the bulk gravitational version of the same problem , representing the euclidean time evolution operator holographically as in ( [ ass ] ) , and show what kind of additional complications arise in trying to select the correct choice when @xmath0 becomes real . to warm up and set the technique we will start with simple unperturbed ads in section [ sec1 ] ( that is @xmath53 ) , matching the minimal area with the generalized gravitational entropy result as in ( [ ass2 ] ) .",
    "this will be done by selecting once and for all the simple case where @xmath2 is just half of the boundary ; in particular we will see the nontrivial role played by the uv cutoffs that has not been covered in detail by @xcite .",
    "understood the static case , for which the analytic continuation in @xmath0 is a trivial problem , we will start to tackle the time dependent case by perturbing the ads metric or , equivalently , by switching on @xmath54 in the hamiltonian . in section [ aaa ]",
    "we set some common results and , finally , in sections [ bbb ] and [ ccc ] we consider two different possibilities for the analytic continuation of the gravitational solution .",
    "the first choice will be selected by requiring the gravity solution to preserve periodicity after a time shift of @xmath55 , when @xmath0 becomes real , and thus giving up periodicity for time shifts of @xmath56 .",
    "this is different by what have been used in @xcite ; the lewkowycz - maldacena choice instead ( preserving @xmath56-periodicity and giving up the @xmath57-one ) will be considered in the last section .",
    "both results will be compared to what we obtain using the ryu - takayanagi formula , which is done at @xmath52 and is thus independent by whatever choice we made for the analytic continuation .",
    "finally we present our conclusions .",
    "for the boundary field theory how to define the analytic continuation of @xmath0 in @xmath20 $ ] is in principle clear : first we define the modular hamiltonian as minus the logarithm of @xmath21 : @xmath58 then , simply @xmath59 thus ( with @xmath60 the normalized @xmath21 ) the entropy computed from the replica trick @xmath61}|_{\\beta=1}+\\log{tr\\left[\\rho\\right]}=-\\partial_{\\beta}\\log{tr \\left[e^{-\\beta\\mathcal{h}}\\right]}|_{\\beta=1}+\\log{tr\\left [ e^{-\\mathcal{h}}\\right]}=\\ ] ] @xmath62}{tr\\left [ e^{-\\mathcal{h}}\\right]}+\\log{tr\\left [ e^{-\\mathcal{h}}\\right]}\\ ] ] correctly coincides with @xmath63=-\\frac{tr\\left[\\rho\\log{\\rho}\\right]}{tr [ \\rho]}+\\log{tr [ \\rho]}=\\frac{tr \\left[\\mathcal{h } e^{-\\mathcal{h}}\\right]}{tr\\left [ e^{-\\mathcal{h}}\\right]}+\\log{tr\\left [ e^{-\\mathcal{h}}\\right ] } .\\ ] ] the problem is that , in general , the exact form for the modular hamiltonian is not known .",
    "what is achievable is an order by order expansion formula called magnus expansion : @xmath64\\ ] ] @xmath65+[[h(t_1),h(t_2)],h(t_3)]\\right)+\\dots .\\ ] ] we consider the case @xmath66 and @xmath67 time independent .",
    "the goal is to compute @xmath68 $ ] at first order in @xmath69 .",
    "the computation is done in appendix ( [ c ] ) and it gives @xmath70_{order \\ ; o(\\delta)}=tr \\left[\\mathcal{t}\\left(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}dt\\;h(t ) e^{-\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}d\\tilde{t}\\;h(\\tilde{t})}\\right)\\right]_{order \\;o(\\delta ) } .\\ ] ] the above formula agrees with the entanglement entropy variation computed in @xcite for a generic normalized density matrix @xmath71 , and reproducing the first law of @xcite @xcite , when @xmath21 is taken to be ( [ dens ] ) and @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "now suppose we did nt know about the modular hamiltonian and of ( [ corret ] ) , and we were looking for the analytic continuation of @xmath74 from the very definition of @xmath21 .",
    "one possible guess would be to use the equality valid for @xmath75 and periodic hamiltonian @xmath76 , @xmath77=tr\\left[\\mathcal{t}e^{-\\int_0^{2\\beta\\pi}h(t)}\\right ]    \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\beta\\in \\mathbb{z},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; h(t+2\\pi)=h(t),\\ ] ] and extend it to @xmath1 .",
    "this however fails for real @xmath0 as @xmath78_{\\beta=1}= tr\\left [ 2\\pi \\mathcal{t}\\left ( h(0 ) e^{-\\int_0^{2\\pi}h(t)}\\right)\\right ] \\neq tr \\left[\\mathcal{h } e^{-\\mathcal{h}}\\right ] , \\ ] ] where the last inequality is already evident at first order in @xmath69 .",

    "@xmath81\\neq tr\\left[\\mathcal{t}e^{-\\beta\\int_0^{2\\pi}h(t)}\\right ]    \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\beta\\in \\mathbb{z},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; h(t+2\\pi)=h(t).\\ ] ] so far we have considered an hamiltonian that , even in its analytically continued version , remained @xmath56 periodic and @xmath0 independent , but other possible choices could involve different periodicities , as for example with @xmath82 period , and/or nontrivial @xmath0 dependence of the hamiltonian .",
    "the moral then is that the correct way of choosing the analytic continuation is far from trivial and simple guesses may easily turn out to be wrong .",
    "let us now look at what happens when we move to the bulk .",
    "we would like to consider now the holographic counterpart of the previous section .    given the classical correspondence @xmath83=e^{-s_{eucl}^{grav}(\\beta ) } , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\beta\\in \\mathbb{z}\\ ] ] the question is how do we analytically continue the gravitational side in order to obtain the dual of @xmath20 $ ] for @xmath1 ?",
    "this time we do not have an analogue of the boundary modular hamiltonian that we can use ; on the other side , as it is a classical problem , all the troubles given by the time ordering disappear .",
    "we will start by considering what periodicity we can impose on the analytically continued action ; when @xmath1 the double periodicity with periods @xmath56 ( for representing the same operator @xmath21 @xmath0-times ) and @xmath82 ( for closing the trace ) is no longer possible , except for constant functions , so we have to choose between preserving one or the other .",
    "when we keep @xmath84 it is natural to define the analytic continuation by time integrating between zero and @xmath56 and then multiplying by @xmath0 : @xmath85\\leftrightarrow e^{-\\beta\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}dt\\;l_{eucl}^{grav}(\\beta , t ) } , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\beta\\in \\mathbb{r } .\\ ] ] if instead we require @xmath86 we are lead to the second proposal : @xmath87\\leftrightarrow e^{-\\int_{0}^{2 \\beta\\pi}dt\\;l_{eucl}^{grav}(\\beta , t ) } , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\beta\\in \\mathbb{r } .\\ ] ] note that when @xmath0 is restricted to be an integer ( [ ddue ] ) automatically becomes periodic also in @xmath88 .",
    "instead the opposite does not happen for ( [ unno ] ) , so we need to require as part of the definition , that @xmath89 in this case obeys the double periodicity whenever @xmath0 is restricted to be an integer .",
    "this poses obvious constraints on the action and makes @xmath90 different from the simple rescaling of the integration extrema of @xmath91 .",
    "we note that ( [ ddue ] ) corresponds in fact to the prescription given in @xcite .",
    "we would then expect it to give the correct result and any other choice to fail . despite this , and because the final goal is to learn more about the analytic continuation , we will still pursue the computation for both proposals above .",
    "further let us point out that any relationship between analytic continuations in the bulk , as the above ( [ unno ] ) , ( [ ddue ] ) , and their possible boundary counterparts is in general complicated .",
    "thus correctly guessing what is the dual of ( [ corret ] ) , or ( [ unob ] ) and ( [ dueb ] ) is not a simple task .",
    "one would love to now repeat the analysis done in the previous section , deriving with respect to @xmath0 and trying to relate the result to the boundary stress - energy tensor .",
    "the computation however , although apparently simple , is far from trivial ; for ( [ unno ] ) we have @xmath92 @xmath93 while for ( [ ddue ] ) @xmath94 if the dependence by @xmath0 was only in the metric we could rewrite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the boundary induced metric ( on the cutoff surfaces we will soon introduce ) , and @xmath97 the boundary induced stress energy momentum tensor .",
    "this because @xmath98 vanishes because of the bulk equations of motion , and the only @xmath0 dependent metric component is @xmath99 , as we will see .",
    "what goes wrong however , apart from the additional terms in ( [ p1 ] ) , is the fact that the very cutoff surface we will use to define our gravitational action , are in general @xmath0 dependent , creating in this way further contributions .",
    "thus we need a more precise computation to check the validity or not of either ( [ ddue ] ) and ( [ unno ] ) at order @xmath100 , in order to correctly reproduce the entanglement entropy through the replica trick .",
    "let us start from the time independent case , where we consider @xmath101 with the submanifold @xmath2 , from now on , being half of the ads boundary .",
    "first we will compute the minimal surface in this case , setting the benchmark against which to check the results obtained from the generalized gravitational entropy computation .",
    "being time independent the various proposals for `` @xmath102 '' are equivalent ; nonetheless we will here set up the computation technique and introduce the cutoff surfaces we will use throwout the paper .",
    "the poincare coordinates in the euclidean signature cover the full ads space , unlikely in the lorentzian case where they cover only half .",
    "thus we can use them even for computing a minimal surface area that cuts in two the full ads , @xmath103 the area of the minimal surface at @xmath104 whose boundary at @xmath105 is @xmath106 , is simply given by the integration of @xmath107 , where @xmath108 are @xmath109 and @xmath110 : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the uv cutoff and @xmath113 compactify the @xmath109 direction .",
    "we start from the poincare metric in polar coordinates with period @xmath55 : @xmath114 @xmath115 this metric is regular everywhere and obviously periodic in @xmath116 as well .",
    "the first problem is to find coordinates such that the proper size of the euclidean time circle does nt vanish ( as @xmath117 ) at the boundary of ads , but eventually only in the interior .",
    "const , the slightly uprising ones are @xmath118 const and the vertical line is the cutoff in @xmath119 .",
    "the values displayed are totally random and have no meaning at all.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    because of this we change the bulk coordinates such that the weyl rescaled metric at the boundary of ads has a nonvanishing time circle .",
    "one possibility is the following transformation @xmath120 with inverse @xmath121 they produce @xmath122 the gravitational action is @xmath123 with @xmath124 , @xmath125 the vector normal to @xmath126 pointing outside , that is away from the bulk , and with unit norm , and @xmath96 the induced metric @xmath127 on the boundary .",
    "note that @xmath128 is the determinant on the coordinates of the boundary , while the contraction for @xmath129 is other all .    for @xmath126",
    "we mean the cutoff surface approaching the boundary .",
    "we will also temporarily need to introduce an additional cutoff on @xmath130 , @xmath131 ; it will be removed at the end of the computation .",
    "const , the almost circular ones are @xmath132 const , while the vertical and horizontal ones are respectively the cutoffs in @xmath110 and @xmath130.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the point of using different coordinates lies entirely in having a different cutoff surface that approaches the ads boundary , such that the metric there has a nonvanishing circle proper size for the coordinate @xmath38 .",
    "this new cutoff is achieved fixing @xmath133 , with @xmath134 some constant . on the other hand",
    "the computation in the original poincare coordinates had a cutoff in @xmath135 .",
    "the relationship between these two cutoffs is given by the first equation in ( [ inveq ] ) , and it depends on @xmath130 . as we want @xmath134 to be constant we need to fix @xmath130 to some value , effectively changing the cutoff procedure in the computation of the generalized gravitational entropy . because the minimal area surface will be computed in @xmath136 coordinates , we can still use the cutoff @xmath135 for that computation provided that the two cutoffs agree at the value of @xmath130 at which the minimal surface is located , that is @xmath48 regularized as @xmath131 : @xmath137 the cutoff on @xmath130 induces an equivalent cutoff on @xmath21 , which depends on the coordinate @xmath119 as well : @xmath138    we can now compute the action ( [ action ] ) using the normal , outward pointing , unit vector to the boundary ( at @xmath139 ) , which is @xmath140 the result is @xmath141 @xmath142 from this expression it is immediate to compute the result in the limit @xmath143 : @xmath144 that coincides with the result from the minimal surface one might wonder if there is a need for a theta term in the action also for this temporary boundary . if introduced however , it is easy to show that the correction to the above formula vanishes in the @xmath145 limit ] .",
    "having found agreement between the entanglement entropy computed from the ryu - takayanagi formula and the corresponding generalized gravitational entropy when restricted to the static ads case , we now move to study its variation when the ads metric has been perturbed .",
    "as we have already discussed we will first select some analytic continuation , then perturb the metric accordingly , solve its equations of motion and use the result to compute the generalized gravitational entropy .",
    "finally we will compare with what has been obtained using the minimal surface procedure .",
    "but before starting we need some general results , independent of the choice for the analytic continuation .    naively one would think that , given a generic metric perturbation @xmath146 , @xmath147 would be zero at first order as the background metric satisfies the equations of motion .",
    "in fact the boundary term of ( [ action ] ) is there exactly to ensure this when a manifold with boundary is considered .",
    "however the caveat is that we work with a cutoff defining a surface on which , as long as the cutoff is not removed , the value of @xmath146 is in general not vanishing ( this will be clear when we will solve the equations of motion for @xmath146 ) . and",
    "the condition for the @xmath129 term in ( [ action ] ) to kill the boundary term is exactly that the perturbation of the metric has to vanish on the boundary .",
    "there are in total four boundary surfaces , two defined by the cutoffs ( [ cutoff1 ] ) and ( [ cutoff2 ] ) , and two by the corresponding infrared versions @xmath148 and @xmath149 , needed to regularize the action when in presence of metric perturbations : @xmath150 @xmath151 it may be argued that @xmath152 and @xmath153 are not on the same level , the first two to eventually be removed at the end of the computation , the seconds to be kept to regularize a truly divergent quantity . sending @xmath145 for example ( or @xmath154 ) ,",
    "removes the corresponding @xmath155 ( @xmath149 ) , while it keeps @xmath153 ) ] .",
    "we will always include a @xmath129 term for the boundaries in @xmath153 , and consider both the case in which a @xmath129 term has been included for those in @xmath155 and @xmath149 , and the one in which it has not",
    ". the final result will be independent by the choice ( for simplicity we temporarily indicate both kind of boundaries as @xmath126 , even though this is not technically correct ) .",
    "from @xcite we have that the variation of the bulk part of the action is @xmath156 with @xmath157 the normal vector to the boundary already encountered and ( calling @xmath158 the ads unperturbed metric ) @xmath159 ( where the last equality comes from symmetric - antisymmetric tensor contraction ) .",
    "moreover @xmath160 with @xmath161 thus it remains @xmath162 note that both terms would vanish if @xmath146 was zero on @xmath126 .    without the @xmath129 term instead we would have @xmath163",
    "the final goal is to compute the perturbation to the entanglement entropy from the formula @xmath164 . according to the two choices ( [ unno ] ) and ( [ ddue ] ) we have either ( [ p1 ] ) or ( [ p2 ] ) that we conveniently rewrite @xmath165 @xmath166    as we already discussed , the dependence on @xmath0 of @xmath167 comes both from the metric and the extremes of integration , ( [ cutoff1 ] ) , ( [ cutoff2 ] ) , ( [ cutoff3 ] ) , and ( [ cutoff4 ] ) .",
    "choosing a boundary orientation we can write @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 refer to the cutoffs ( [ cutoff2 ] ) and ( [ cutoff4 ] ) evaluated in @xmath173 , and analogously for @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "we notice however that the direct @xmath0 dependence of @xmath155 and @xmath149 in fact cancels with the induced one by fixing @xmath176 , as can be checked straightforwardly .",
    "thus for the two integrals in the first line of ( [ q ] ) , the overall @xmath0 derivative of ( [ pp1 ] ) and ( [ pp2 ] ) passes directly on the integrand .",
    "finally @xmath177 is a short notation for the integrand at fixed time of ( [ m ] ) and @xmath178 for either ( [ m ] ) or ( [ n ] ) .",
    "relative signs appear in ( [ q ] ) as we choose to maintain the same orientation for the perpendicular @xmath125 vector to both ir and uv boundaries , as explained in appendix [ a ] .",
    "then we need to solve the equations for @xmath146 for whatever analytic continuation we have chosen , evaluate the vector @xmath125 and boundary metric @xmath179 , plug the result into ( [ m ] ) ( or ( [ n ] ) ) for computing the above result ( [ q ] ) and then , finally , either ( [ pp1 ] ) or ( [ pp2 ] ) .",
    "the outcome shall be compared with the results obtained from the minimal surface .    in both analytic continuations",
    "we will consider the same background metric we already used for pure ads , ( [ f ] ) , dictated by regularity when @xmath28 and , being @xmath51independent , obviously satisfying any @xmath51periodicity conditions we want to ask for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "for convenience we rescale certain perturbations by factors of @xmath180 and by the common factor @xmath181 and write , using the fefferman - graham gauge , @xmath182 @xmath183 where obviously @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "this is the form we will use throwout the paper ( but not in the next section ) .",
    "the difference will come in the explicit shape for the @xmath146 , and the periodicity conditions they will satisfy .",
    "as the minimal area computation is done at @xmath52 , the result should be independent by whichever analytic continuations we are considering when solving for @xmath146 .",
    "however in practice , as the equations of motion will be solved using different choices for the fourier transform , it is more convenient to treat the two cases separately . to compute the perturbation to the minimal area it is better to go back to the poincare coordinates ( [ g ] ) . in the fefferman - graham gauge ( @xmath187 ) @xmath188 @xmath189 the equation for @xmath190",
    "have been solved ( there in the lorentzian signature ) at first order in @xmath69 in @xcite : @xmath191 @xmath192 ( the normalization is to ensure @xmath193 ) .",
    "as the surface is extremal we need only to compute the variation of the area due to the metric variation , and not the change of shape , that is an higher order effect .",
    "then @xmath194 and , using ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) we obtain @xmath195 as we will always encounter an integral over @xmath109 that , being unbounded , should eventually be regularized , both for minimal surfaces and gravitational action , from now on we will simply compare the corresponding integrand @xmath196 to avoid further issues : @xmath197 then using ( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the regularized version of the confluent hypergeometric function .",

    "we can at this point , if we wish , compute the space integral over @xmath109 of @xmath201 . as the only @xmath109 dependence is in the exponential factor , the result is simply proportional to a delta function with @xmath202 and @xmath203 support : @xmath204      we want to solve the 15 linearized equations of motion for @xmath146 defined as in ( [ i ] ) , that are listed in appendix [ b ] , while imposing periodicity for @xmath205 for @xmath206 .",
    "the solution looks as follows @xmath207 @xmath208 where the @xmath209 on the right hand side are the same fourier coefficients of ( [ c ] ) whose explicit expression is ( [ d ] ) , and we have allowed an additional @xmath0 dependence inside @xmath210 .",
    "in addition there are five algebraic constraints : , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 @xmath215 using the above solution , after a change of coordinates to @xmath216 , we want to evaluate ( [ pp1 ] ) .",
    "we begin by computing @xmath217 that is the @xmath0 derivative of ( [ q ] ) .",
    "the explicit expression for the various terms appearing in ( [ q ] ) are given in appendix ( [ a ] ) as a function of the perturbation @xmath146 ; plugging in the above solution we obtain the required result .",
    "we start with the first line of ( [ q ] ) and notice that the two terms just differ by the sign and the replacement @xmath218 .",
    "thus we limit ourselves to the computation of the first using the formula for @xmath177 ( [ sun ] ) .",
    "as we have already seen , the extremes of integration happen to be @xmath0 independent , so that the derivative acts only on the integrand .",
    "we have @xmath219 we are interested in the limit @xmath145 .",
    "as we do not know how to compute the integral , what we can do is to write the integrand as a series in positive and negative powers of @xmath21 and @xmath119 , compute the integral for each single term and analyse finite and divergent contributions .",
    "then , temporarily ignoring the time integral , @xmath220_{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r^2+\\epsilon_z^2}}^{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r^2+\\epsilon_z^2}\\frac{l_r}{\\epsilon_r}}\\ ] ] @xmath221_{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r^2+\\epsilon_z^2}}^{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_r^2+\\epsilon_z^2}\\frac{l_r}{\\epsilon_r } } .\\ ] ] from direct computation we can check that @xmath222 for every @xmath223 and @xmath224 ( no log term ) , and for every @xmath125 and @xmath225 .",
    "then terms not vanishing in the @xmath145 limit , either divergent or @xmath226 independent , can come only from @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "in particular the case with @xmath229 has contribution when @xmath145 from both integration extrema , while for the others values of @xmath223 only at @xmath230 .",
    "we can compute the @xmath21 and time integral of the @xmath229 , @xmath227 term ( zero order in @xmath226 of the integrand and generic function in @xmath21 , as the negative powers are vanishing ) , and obtain @xmath231 @xmath232 when @xmath226 goes to zero the hypergeometric in the first term simply converges to a function of the only @xmath112 .",
    "the other instead is badly divergent in @xmath226 ( and @xmath233 ) , going like @xmath234 .",
    "we disregard this divergence and keep only the finite contribution .",
    "as we will encounter @xmath226 singularities throughout the paper let me briefly comment on it .",
    "one of the properties of the gravitational solution considered in @xcite was to contain only mild singularities whenever @xmath117 , that would automatically drop off once computing the entropy @xmath44 ; more specifically it was supposed to be possible to constrain the solution such that this behaviour would happen .",
    "as here we are presently considering a different periodicity then the one used by lewkowycz and maldacena , one would think that the issue arises precisely because of this and it would disappear once the l - m periodic conditions on the gravitational solution are applied .",
    "nonetheless the same divergences will be present in the next section as well , without any clear possibility to constrain the solution so that they would drop when computing the entropy .",
    "the result is that we will limit ourselves to consider the finite part of the entropy , but a better understanding of this issue is important .",
    "the result of this `` ad hoc '' renormalization , together with the subtraction of the corresponding @xmath235 term , is a first contribution to the entropy : @xmath236 @xmath237 where we wrote @xmath238    then we pass to compute the @xmath227 and @xmath239 coefficients , for each power of @xmath125 and integrated over time .",
    "what happens is that for each one we obtain a divergent term ( negative power in @xmath226 ) , generically @xmath112 dependent , that we throw away , and a finite contribution always @xmath112 independent .",
    "thus when we consider the corresponding term with opposite sign after the @xmath218 substitution , all of them simply vanish .",
    "let us move to the second line of ( [ q ] ) .",
    "now the integration extrema are @xmath0 dependent ; we can however change integration variable from @xmath240 in such a way to remove the @xmath0 dependence from the integration extrema and make them finite in the limit @xmath145 .",
    "so we have @xmath241 that more explicitly can be written as @xmath242 @xmath243 we start from the case with @xmath129 term ; the above integrand is given by ( [ srhosn ] ) , transforming to @xmath244 and plugging in our solution for @xmath146 .",
    "in particular direct computation shows that the terms @xmath233 independent vanish in the limit @xmath145 while the ones containing @xmath233 give rise only to the same badly exponentially divergent contribution already encountered .",
    "as we have already done we disregard them .",
    "an analogous story can be told when we have a @xmath129 term by using ( [ srhocn ] ) .    we remain with @xmath245 the computation proceeds more or less in the same way , with the only finite term coming from the @xmath226 independent term in the integrand of ( [ sun ] ) (",
    "@xmath229 , @xmath227 in the formalism used so far ) , and discarding divergences .",
    "the result is @xmath246 @xmath247 as no more contributions are present , we have then achieved an expression for ( [ pp1 ] ) , the finite result given by the sum @xmath248 of ( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ cc1 ] ) .",
    "this is not however the end , as explained in the next section .",
    "our metric perturbation @xmath146 has been constructed in ( [ h ] ) to be periodic after a shift of the time variable @xmath205 for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "however when @xmath29 the present solution does not become automatically periodic for @xmath249 , as we would like . in other words",
    "what we would need is to further constrain the @xmath250 in order to enforce @xmath249 periodicity as long as @xmath29 .",
    "the solution will then retain by construction only the @xmath251 periodicity once @xmath206 .",
    "let us first show what @xmath250 should look like in order to have periodicity in @xmath205 and @xmath249 when @xmath29 . to this end let us transform in polar coordinates the fourier momenta @xmath252 and @xmath253 : @xmath254 so that @xmath255 fourier transforming @xmath256 in this way , will make the resulting function in @xmath42 clearly periodic for @xmath205 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath256 is periodic in @xmath257 , we can rescale the integration variable @xmath258 in order to absorb also the shift @xmath249 , as long as @xmath259 .",
    "that is we need periodicity for @xmath256 also when @xmath260 , which is compatible with @xmath257 only if @xmath29 .",
    "let us implement the solution of @xmath261 and write it as a function of @xmath262 .",
    "the transformation @xmath263 translates in @xmath262 variables to @xmath264 a function of @xmath262 invariant under ( [ trsf ] ) should depend only on @xmath265\\equiv k_1 ^ 2+k_{t_e}^2 $ ] and @xmath266\\equiv e^{i n\\beta \\arctan[k_1,k_{t_e}]}$ ] , @xmath267.$ ] we mean a function that gives the angle whose tangent is the ratio @xmath268 , and taking into account the quadrant ( @xmath269 when @xmath270 , @xmath271 when @xmath272 , @xmath273 when @xmath274 and @xmath275 when @xmath276 ) . ]",
    "further we rewrite the expressions in ( [ h ] ) for @xmath277 without the spurious terms in @xmath278 by integrating by parts in the fourier space , @xmath279 as we want invariance under ( [ trsf ] ) we first require @xmath280 and @xmath281 to be functions of only @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "then we constrain @xmath284 and @xmath285 , the only two remaining independent functions according to ( [ h2 ] ) , so that all the expressions on the right hand side of the exponential in ( [ h3 ] ) are themselves functions of only @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "that is ( focusing only on the @xmath262 variables ) @xmath286 for generic @xmath287 , @xmath288 etc ... after a lengthy computation we arrive at the , fortunately simple result @xmath289 note that these two functions are not by themselves invariant under ( [ trsf ] ) but they transform in such a way to make each of the @xmath146 given by ( [ h]),([h2 ] ) , ( [ h3 ] ) and ( [ h5 ] ) ultimately periodic in @xmath249 ( for integer @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus we ended up with only three independent functions : @xmath290 , @xmath291 and @xmath292 .",
    "in particular @xmath293 and @xmath294 now are @xmath295 we have chosen to avoid any direct dependence on @xmath0 inside @xmath296 and @xmath297 , but only through @xmath283 .",
    "this will turn out to be the correct prescription .",
    "we can insert the result in ( [ c1 ] ) and , after a change of integration variables from @xmath262 to @xmath108 , an integration by part in @xmath298 , and a change back to @xmath262 , we obtain the result for @xmath299 to be transformed from ( [ c1 ] ) to : @xmath300 @xmath301 @xmath302 and analogously for @xmath303 : @xmath304 @xmath305 @xmath306 their sum gives @xmath307 @xmath308 and exactly matches ( [ e ] ) . dependence to be through the variables",
    "@xmath108 ] this result is surprising as , having different periodic conditions then in @xcite , we would have expected disagreement .",
    "this may be an effect of being at first order in @xmath69 , somehow mimicking the corresponding boundary situation we encountered when using ( [ dueb ] ) , or it may be the sign that multiple choices for the analytic continuation can be done if the goal is to compute the entropy .",
    "this last possibility does not clash with the construction of lewkowycz and maldacena , in fact it even reinforces it as different choices lead to the same result , but it raises the issue of unicity of the analytic continuation and how to physically single out one from another .",
    "now we want to solve the equations of motion for @xmath146 so that the solution remains explicitly periodic in @xmath249 ( but not in @xmath205 ) after analytic continuation of @xmath0 , with the perturbations conveniently chosen as in ( [ i ] ) . to this end",
    "we fourier transform @xmath146 as follows @xmath311 plugging the above form into the expressions of appendix [ b ] , the resulting equations are quite complicated to solve as they are intrinsically coupled between different perturbations .",
    "however they simplify if we restrict to the case @xmath312 .",
    "as can be seen playing with the equations this implies @xmath313 . to compute the action we do not need to solve all the equations as ( [ sun ] ) ,",
    "( [ srhosn ] ) and ( [ srhocn ] ) contain only @xmath314 and @xmath315 ( equal by assumption ) .",
    "their equation reduces to ( @xmath316 but it is valid also for @xmath317 ) @xmath318 where for simplicity we have dropped the dependence of @xmath319 by @xmath320 and @xmath203 . applying the ansatz @xmath321",
    "we can decouple the equation in @xmath110 by the one in @xmath130 requiring @xmath322 to satisfy @xmath323 then the equation in @xmath110 becomes @xmath324 the solutions are respectively ( with @xmath325 ) @xmath326 at this point both @xmath327 and @xmath328 are free parameters to be correctly normalized , that may depend on @xmath329 and @xmath0 .",
    "we choose them in order to select solutions with certain asymptotic behaviours ; two obvious choices are @xmath330 the first ( plus ) making @xmath322 finite in the limit @xmath117 , the second ( minus ) in the limit @xmath331 . when @xmath332 the asymptotic behaviour in @xmath333 is @xmath334independent , so we fix @xmath335 in order to have @xmath336 .    given this solution we want to evaluate ( [ pp2 ] ) .",
    "the procedure is analogous as in the previous sections , only with different perturbations involved and , as we are in the case @xmath312 , expressions ( [ sun ] ) , ( [ srhosn ] ) and ( [ srhocn ] ) further simplify .    the computation of ( [ q2 ] ) , both when we do and do not have a @xmath129 term , gives the same vanishing plus exponentially divergent results , when the @xmath226 and @xmath233 cutoffs are removed . thus no finite contribution . also ( [ uno ] ) works similarly and the only finite term that we obtain comes from the order zero in the @xmath226 expansion of the integrand . as in doing the time integral between @xmath337 $ ] @xmath338 gives always zero unless @xmath332 , the choice between the two asymptotic solutions of ( [ p ] ) is irrelevant , with @xmath339 .",
    "then the result is ( using @xmath340 that comes from the first equation of ( [ aleq ] ) ) @xmath341 @xmath342      for comparison with the above result we have to compute the minimal area surface when the perturbation @xmath146 has been fourier transformed as in the above section , with the position of the minimal area surface translated from @xmath343 into @xmath344 : @xmath345 and @xmath346 where we have chosen the first solution of equation ( [ p ] ) and the contribution coming only from the @xmath332 sector , the rest being infinitesimal in the limit @xmath145 .",
    "this coincides with ( [ res ] ) if we impose the simple condition on @xmath347 : @xmath348    if we wish we can again perform the integration over @xmath109 to obtain : @xmath349",
    "what we have done in this paper is to consider two different possible analytic continuations in @xmath0 of the holographic counterpart of @xmath350 $ ] .",
    "the guideline for choosing them has been what periodicity to keep for the gravitational solution , out of the two we should impose when @xmath29 .",
    "one possible choice is the one used by lewkowycz and maldacena , that allows for a proof of the ryu - takayanagi formula , the other is essentially its complement . as the choice done in @xcite is an assumption , the idea was to bring additional evidence from a first order computation ; instead we have found that both solutions work correctly at first order , reproducing the corresponding result obtained from computing the minimal area .",
    "thus it may in principle be possible to consider additional different , more involved gravitational metrics and to expect some of them to provide the correct result at first order .",
    "this is somehow reminiscent of the corresponding boundary problem , where the wrong choice ( [ dueb ] ) could nonetheless reproduce the right first order result .",
    "an obvious possibility for better understanding the issue would be to go to second order in @xmath69 .",
    "this however seems impractical , both because of the complication in solving the einstein s equations and as , at second order , the minimal surface shape should be backreacted .",
    "nonetheless some results appeared recently at second order in @xcite so , perhaps , an attempt to go to second order may be worth . in general so far how to provide a more robust understanding for the holographic dual of @xmath351 $ ] for real @xmath0 is still an open problem .    besides the above story",
    "two additional considerations arise : one being the divergences in @xmath226 that we had to throw away when performing the computation .",
    "the second is the choice for the @xmath0 dependence inside @xmath352 that we have made in order to reproduce the correct result from the minimal area . concerning the divergences we do not have much to say ; we solved einstein s equations at first order for the perturbation of a regular background , but the entropy evaluated from the gravitational action presents divergencies , in contrast with the general analysis in @xcite .",
    "further these divergencies appear both as negative powers of @xmath226 , that may be regularized after an appropriate choice of counterterms ( see for example @xcite ) , and as exponentials that are clearly more problematic",
    ". a possibility would be to constrain the solution in order to make the entropy finite , but how to do so is not clear .",
    "besides this fact , the finite part of the computation correctly agrees with the minimal area result , for both analytic continuations , only if we assume a certain @xmath0 dependence of the fourier coefficients , leading respectively to the discussion below equation ( [ h6 ] ) and to equation ( [ hh6 ] ) .",
    "respecting these additional constrains is not a problem in practice , but their very presence is a novelty .",
    "finally we treated in detail the issue of cutoffs and coordinates in ads .",
    "this may seem a technical problem but in fact most of the work is directly connected with it : the @xmath353 to @xmath354 transformation permits to correctly compute the entropy and sets the cutoff in @xmath354 coordinates and their relationship with the ones in @xmath353 ; these then fix the boundaries on which @xmath355 lives ( making it non zero ) , make its @xmath0 dependence non trivial and , by sending @xmath145 , directly implement the restriction of the entropy to the region in ads where the time circle shrinks .",
    "as most of these issues were so far not explicitly covered in the literature , at least in practical examples , we felt compelling a more precise discussion .",
    "the generalized gravitational entropy is not only a useful tool for providing a proof of the ryu - takayanagi formula , but it also allows to extend the holographic description of entanglement entropy beyond the original range of applicability ; for example for studying bulk quantum corrections @xcite and @xcite , or higher derivatives extensions of the gravity theory , for instance @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this last case case in particular is interesting , as we do not know of any functional such that its minimization would provide a generalization of the ryu - takayanagi formula for a bulk theory with generic higher curvature terms . still using the generalized gravitational entropy it has been possible to construct some formulas for the holographic computation of the entanglement entropy .",
    "the technique developed in the present paper may then be extended to some of these theories , for example to compute holographically the reaction and dynamics of the entanglement entropy to sudden changes of parameters , known as quantum quenches .",
    "i would like to thank aitor lewkowycz , tadashi takayanagi , masaki shigemori and diego trancanelli for suggestions and comments on the paper .",
    "further the result of appendix [ c ] has been taken from shigemori s notes , although the proof here is different , and the first motivation for the present work has sourced from several discussions with him .",
    "this work was founded by fapesp fellowship 2013/10460 - 9 .",
