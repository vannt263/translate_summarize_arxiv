    "in the past years and decades , several models of nova shells have been presented in the literature .",
    "often they were adapted to describe the state and evolution of specific objects , and often remarkable agreement between model and observation was achieved .",
    "nevertheless it should be kept in mind that a nova shell is a rapidly evolving object , and its properties change significantly with time .",
    "furthermore , a plethora of different types of novae are observed , which is accompanied by an amazing variety of nova shells of various morphologies and physical properties in different stages of temporal development .",
    "although studies of nova shells have been carried out since the first bright nova of the 20th century , gk persei in 1901 , most of these studies were carried out in a qualitative way .",
    "this approach permitted the calculation of nebular expansion parallaxes and the morphological study of shells . since the shells were usually faint , and the observations were carried out with photographic plates , hardly any quantitative results are available . only in the first phases of the outburst ,",
    "when the shells document themselves in the form of emission lines , were the line fluxes estimated and derived for a few cases , notably by payne - gaposchkin and collaborators .",
    "replacement of the photographic plate by digital receivers has facilitated the task of studying the evolution of nova remnants , both spectroscopically and by means of direct imaging through narrow - band filters .",
    "in fact , quite a number of studies have even been carried out for extragalactic novae , where h@xmath0-images can more easily detect the objects above the stellar background ( see , e.g. ciardullo et al .",
    "1987 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the results of a recent imaging survey of nova remnants , carried out at the kitt peak and eso la silla observatories .",
    "we also use a hitherto unpublished survey of nova shells carried out in 1984 at calar alto , and the images from the _ hubble space telescope _ archive .",
    "furthermore , we have collected and homogenized the existing quantitative record of nova shell observations . because the survey attempted to cover as many objects in as many evolutionary stages as possible , hardly any detailed information on a given object , or any detailed modelling of shells will be given ( i.e. the distribution of line flux between various specific parts of a nova shell ) .",
    "we rather attempt to describe the `` average '' or global evolutionary track of a nova shell , in order to derive expected values for faint shells of ancient novae",
    ". a theoretical interpretation of the observed behavior will be the subject of a forthcoming paper ( duerbeck & downes 2002 ) .",
    "section 2 describes our observations and reductions .",
    "section 3 briefly describes the classification of novae according to speed class , which is the base for merging our shell luminosity data into groups .",
    "section 4 gives the derivation of global trends in luminosity evolution for the lines h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 in novae of different speed classes ( including , besides classical novae , recurrent ones ) .",
    "section 5 summarizes our results .",
    "old data of nova shell line fluxes , derived both from spectral observations or direct images , were collected from the literature .",
    "besides many data scattered in the literature , the early photographic studies of payne - gaposchkin and collaborators deserve special mentioning , as well as the recent tololo nova survey , carried out by williams and collaborators , and kindly put at our disposal by him .",
    "the new observations were obtained at the european southern observatory , la silla , chile , and at the the kitt peak national observatory . on 1998  march  21  23 ,",
    "the dutch 0.9  m telescope at eso , equipped with a tek tk512cb chip ( @xmath3 pixels ) with a scale of @xmath4 pixel@xmath5 was used . on 1998  may  28  june  1 , observations were obtained with the kpno 2.1  m telescope using the tek `` t1ka '' chip ( @xmath6 pixels with a scale of @xmath7 pixel@xmath5 ) , and on 1998  june  30 with the kpno 0.9  m telescope using the tek `` t2ka '' chip ( @xmath8 pixels with a scale of @xmath9 pixel@xmath5 ) .",
    "a final run was carried out at the danish 1.54  m telescope at eso on 2000  july  16 .",
    "the dfosc was used , which has a loral / lesser chip ( @xmath10 pixels with a scale of @xmath11 pixel@xmath5 ) .",
    "the data were obtained with narrow - band filters centered at h@xmath0 ( 80 and 62   fwhm at the eso dutch and danish , 36  at kpno ) and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 ( 55 and 57  at the eso dutch and danish , 31  at kpno ) , as well as off - band and _ ubvr _ filters ; see downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) for details .",
    "note that the offband [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 filter for the objects observed at eso is a strmgren @xmath12 filter .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner .",
    "flux calibration of the novae were obtained via `` standard '' planetary nebulae .",
    "ngc  6833 was used for the kpno observations .",
    "the h@xmath0 and @xmath13 $ ] flux of ngc  6833 was determined by tony keyes ( private communication ) based on _ hubble space telescope _",
    "faint object spectrograph observations , and we adopted values of @xmath14 erg @xmath15 s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath16 and @xmath17 erg @xmath15 s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath16 for h@xmath0 and @xmath13 $ ] , respectively . for the `` dutch '' observations , sp 1 was used .",
    "the h@xmath0 and @xmath13 $ ] flux of sp 1 was measured by perinotto et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and the authors of the strasbourg / eso catalog of galactic planetary nebulae ( acker et al . 1992 ) spectroscopically , and by webster ( 1969 ) , copetti ( 1990 ) and shaw & kaler ( 1989 ) through interference filters .",
    "unfortunately , the results show some scatter , so we assume fluxes of @xmath18 erg @xmath15 s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath16 and @xmath19 erg @xmath15 s@xmath5 arcsec@xmath16 for h@xmath0 and @xmath13 $ ] , respectively .",
    "for the `` danish '' observations , three objects from the list of dopita & hua ( 1997 ) were used : pn 327.5 + 13.3 , pn 327.1@xmath2001.8 , and pn 321.3@xmath2016.7 .    on the second night of the eso `` dutch '' observations ,",
    "the flux of sp 1 was fainter by @xmath21 and @xmath22 in h@xmath0 and @xmath13 $ ] , an effect that was traced in the magnitudes of stars measured in these filters as well .",
    "thus , we assume that the overall transmission , and not the central wavelength , underwent a change .",
    "broadband transmission was very similar in the three nights .",
    "we thus took the nightly aperture magnitude of the pn , corrected to airmass 1 , as the `` zero - point '' of the system , which corresponds to the fluxes given .",
    "the targets were partly starlike , and normal daophot photometry was carried out for most of the nebulae . in the @xmath13 $ ] data , v842  cen and v1974  cyg",
    "were slightly resolved , and rr  pic and cp  pup were clearly resolved ( downes & duerbeck 2000 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the onband and offband frames were aligned , the offband frame scaled appropriately to cancel the majority of stars , and subtracted from the onband frame . in most cases , a starlike center remained ( because of emission in the region of @xmath13 $ ] ) , and this central emission was again fitted with a psf - profile of the onband frame , yielding an emission - line magnitude of the central star .",
    "the detached nebular shell emission was measured in an annulus , where the central `` remnant '' that remained from the subtraction and fitting attempts , was duly neglected .",
    "more objects were slightly resolved in h@xmath0 , and a similar process was performed .",
    "for the starlike images , the nova magnitudes measured from the images are a combination of the line flux from the shell plus a continuum flux from the stellar remnant .",
    "this continuum flux needs to be removed if we are to study the h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line fluxes themselves . to correct for the continuum flux",
    ", a fit was made to all objects ( excluding the nova ) in the field of the form @xmath23 these fits allowed us to estimate the flux in the continuum of the novae , and thus to derive net line fluxes .    for the eso observations ,",
    "the use of the broad - band strmgren @xmath12 filter as the [ o  iii ] off - band resulted in a more involved continuum removal .",
    "we note that this filter has practically the same central wavelength as a broadband johnson @xmath24 filter , without , however , including strong emission lines like the [ o  iii ] lines . for all field stars ,",
    "@xmath24 magnitudes in the standard system are available .",
    "the magnitude difference for the @xmath24- and the ( uncalibrated ) @xmath12-observations was determined , by establishing the relation @xmath25 i.e. by determining the zero - point difference @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , for all stars ( excluding the nova ) the relation @xmath27 was established and @xmath28 determined .",
    "thus the magnitude difference between the @xmath24 magnitude and the [ o  iii]-magnitude of an object without emission lines is @xmath29 field stars of all colours scatter from these linear relations by @xmath30 to @xmath31 , including m - stars with tio bands .",
    "thus it is likely that unusually blue stars ( like nova star continua in their late stages ) also will not deviate significantly .    under this assumption , the presumably emission - free @xmath12 magnitude of the nova was used to calculate its hypothetical `` emission - free '' @xmath24-magnitude , and from this magnitude , its `` emission - free '' [ o  iii]-magnitude was derived .",
    "the flux corresponding to this magnitude was subtracted from the flux calculated from the observed [ o  iii]-magnitude , yielding an `` emission - only '' [ o  iii ] flux . in most cases ,",
    "the correction due to stellar contamination was below 10% of the total flux .",
    "we also evaluated direct images of nova shells , taken in august 1984 through h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 filters , with a ccd camera in the cassegrain focus of the calar alto 2.2 m telescope ( operated by the centro astronomico hispano - aleman , almeria , and the max - planck institut fr astronomie , heidelberg ; observers were h.w .",
    "duerbeck and w.c .",
    "seitter ) . only resolved shells were considered , the central stars ( and others in the field ) were reduced with the daophot allstar routine within iraf , and aperture photometry was carried out using midas .",
    "the planetary nebula m57 ( ngc 6720 ) served as a flux standard .",
    "furthermore , we used flux - calibrated spectroscopic observations of several novae , taken ( by us ) at several telescopes in the past 25 years .",
    "determination of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 and h@xmath0 fluxes was straightforward , since the shells were usually unresolved .",
    "we were also given access to the extensive data set obtained in the tololo nova survey ( cf .",
    "williams et al .",
    "1994 ) , from which direct line flux measurements were made .",
    "in addition to the ground - based data , we used archival [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 and h@xmath0 images obtained with the _ hubble space telescope_. finally , we collected shell fluxes from the literature , which were derived from direct images or spectroscopy of nova shells .",
    "to be able to compare line strengths from different objects , we converted the observed fluxes to luminosities ; the distances and reddenings necessary for the conversion were mostly taken from downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) ; a few additional determinations or re - determinations are discussed in the appendix of this paper .",
    "the list of objects , with adopted distances , reddenings , and references to these data , as well as references for the flux measurements , is given in table  1 .",
    "the complete set of data are given in table  2 , table  3 and table  4 for [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 , h@xmath0 , and h@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in order to merge sparse observations of many objects into a single diagram , a reasonable grouping of objects seems desirable .",
    "since the photospheric growth and shrinking is controlled by the mass loss in the course of the outburst , and the photospheric shrinking is reflected in the light curve , we have found it appropriate to sort the data according to nova speed class .",
    "the speed classes adopted were those defined in payne - gaposchkin ( 1957 ) : very fast , fast , moderately fast , slow and very slow , depending on the average decline rate over the first two magnitudes ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "her classification supersedes previous schemes by mclaughlin ( 1939 ) ( fast , average , slow , rt ser - type ) and bertaud ( 1948 ) ( fast , slow , very slow ) , which were usually based on @xmath33 times .",
    "however , payne - gaposchkin s classification can lead to serious errors in some slow novae which show a pronounced maximum of somewhat more than two magnitudes , superimposed on a plateau of almost constant brightness ( e.g.  rr pic ) . in a few cases ,",
    "we have deliberately modified the assignment to group together similar objects .",
    "similarly , a few reassignments were made to better fit the shell flux data of a single object to the general trend prevailing in a neighboring speed class .",
    "such reassignments are noted below .",
    "in addition to the speed classes , we have also tried to discriminate between the spectral classes fe- and he / n novae according to the criteria given by williams ( 1992 ) ; a source of this information is della valle & livio ( 1998 ) . finally , confirmed and probable onemg novae were identified , either from recent work in the literature , or from earlier descriptions ( for an early identification of such objects , see mclaughlin ( 1944 ) ) .    the objects for which shell flux data were obtained are listed in table 1 , together with decline times @xmath34 , speed class , spectral class , and peculiarity ( i.e. onemg group , recurrent nova , or nova with noticeable dust formation ) .",
    "the nova distances and reddenings of table 1 and the observed nova fluxes of tables 2 , 3 and 4 were used to calculate line luminosities , which are also given in tables 2 , 3 and 4 .",
    "depending on the distance , reddening and type of nova , the luminosity of the stellar remnant , as well as the light gathering and resolving power of the telescope used for the study , there is a lower limit for the line luminosity that can still be recorded with certainty . in general , we have assumed a luminosity of @xmath35 erg  s@xmath5 as the lower limit that was achieved with the telescopes used in this study .",
    "this should be regarded as an averaged a posteriori value . to derive a correct estimate of the lower limit",
    ", one would not only have to take into account the distance , but also source confusion in the case of an extended shell , and the contribution of accretion disk emission in the case of a pointlike object . in the following",
    ", the nova is said to have `` switched off '' emission in a specific line if its luminosity was below the value @xmath35 erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "the behavior of very fast novae is illustrated in figs .",
    "1  3 . in these diagrams ,",
    "the logarithm of the luminosity ( measured in ergs  @xmath36 ) is plotted versus logarithm of time after maximum ( time measured in years ) .",
    "ordinary galactic novae are shown as filled circles , and relations are determined exclusively for this galactic dataset , unless stated otherwise .",
    "extragalactic novae are shown as open circles , and are merely displayed for comparison .",
    "unusual novae ( mentioned in the text and the figure caption ) are shown with special symbols .",
    "the h@xmath0 evolution of very fast novae appears to be quite homogeneous , unlike the evolution of the other spectral lines considered below .",
    "several objects , however , have to be considered separately .",
    "one is m31-c31 , which is similar in evolution than the other novae , but systematically fainter at earlier stages ( see below ) .",
    "the long series of measurements of v838 her ( indicated as asterisks in figs .",
    "13 ) shows that it is much fainter and faster in its evolution than other very fast novae , except v4160 sgr , which is marked with encircled asterisks .",
    "many of the famous bright novae of the 20th century ( v603 aql , gk per and cp lac ) are not present in this diagram , since no spectrophotometry was obtained longward of the photographic ( blue ) region .",
    "the general evolution can be approximated by straight lines . at times",
    "@xmath37 ( @xmath38 days ) , the novae have @xmath39 or an almost constant luminosity , @xmath40 at times @xmath41 ( 10 days to 1 year ) @xmath42 and at late times ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 the fit was restricted to @xmath45 , since at very late times emission from the accretion disk may contaminate the measurements .",
    "a few points were omitted , which belong to single , poorly - observed objects .",
    "the data points of v838 her lie all on a straight line which can be approximated by @xmath46    the class of ` superbright novae ' ( v1500 cyg , n lmc 1991 ) by della valle ( 1991 ) is not obvious in the present diagrams . if there is anything peculiar , it is the _ faintness _ of m31-c31 .",
    "since della valle used the m31 novae as a template ( and m31-c31 appears to fit well into this group ) , it appears that _ all _ very fast galactic novae fall into the region of the superbright novae , a fact also clearly seen in the s - calibration of downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) , as applied to galactic novae .",
    "why there is such a marked discrepancy in the observed behaviour of very fast novae in the galaxy and in m31 remains to be explained .    at late times",
    "( typically @xmath47 , i.e. 50 years after outburst ) , fast novae still show h@xmath0 emission at a level of a few @xmath48 .",
    "two objects , however , are noticeably brighter : cp pup and gk per .",
    "it is obvious that the emission does not originate from the accretion disk , since the shell is spatially resolved .",
    "the h@xmath1 flux shows a large scatter ( this is possibly due to the fact that the old novae v603 aql , gk per , cp lac etc .",
    "are now included ) .",
    "it appears as if there are two well - defined bands , an upper and a lower one , with only a few points in between .",
    "the extragalactic ( lmc , m31 ) novae seem to cluster near the lower band . as in the previous diagram ,",
    "v838 her is notably fainter than the rest .    as in the case of h@xmath0 , between @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( i.e. 1 day and 15 days after maximum ) , flux levels",
    "are almost constant at @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53  ergs  @xmath36 ) ; afterwards , a decline sets in . at times @xmath54 @xmath55 at times @xmath41",
    ", a dichotomy seems indicated .",
    "the upper line is @xmath56 and the lower one @xmath57 at late times @xmath58 , the slope is only poorly documented , and at times @xmath59 , emission from the disk may dominate .",
    "the slope at late times is : @xmath60 the time interval @xmath61 can also be fitted with one straight line : @xmath62 finally , the nova v838 her follows its own relation : @xmath63    the x - ray turnoff time of such objects is typically of the order one to several hundred days according to vablandingham et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , so that the break in h@xmath1 ( and [ o iii ] ) around 1 year may have to do with the switching off of nuclear burning on the central object . at late stages",
    "( @xmath64 of the order of 50 years ) , objects cluster at some @xmath65 .",
    "no late h@xmath1 observations exist for gk per and cp pup .",
    "generally , [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 appears around age @xmath66 ( about a month after optical maximum ) , and remains within a factor 10 constant until @xmath67 ( i.e. one year after outburst ) . as in the case of h@xmath1 ,",
    "two well - expressed bands seem to be present , with the extragalactic novae populating the lower one .",
    "after two years , the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission declines dramatically and for most objects is not recorded any more after 10 years .",
    "there are two noticeable exceptions : cp pup and gk per , which show emission at almost @xmath68 50  85 years after outburst . however , the luminosity from cp pup is due to n ii 5005 , as was found spectroscopically by williams ( 1982 ) , while the emission in gk per is indeed due to [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 ( bode et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "the dichotomy that appeared in the h@xmath1 luminosities is again clearly seen . a fit through the points with @xmath69 yields @xmath70 for the upper line , and @xmath71 for the lower one .",
    "subsequently , both bands merge and a drop @xmath72 is observed .",
    "the last two data points , which belong to cp pup and gk per , were neglected in this fit . for the remaining novae",
    ", a luminosity of @xmath65 is reached at @xmath73 , i.e.  11 years after outburst .",
    "the maximum phase appears to reveal the presence of two groups , which show almost the same temporal behavior , but are clearly separated by a factor @xmath74 in emission line luminosity , with an amazingly low scatter . among the objects in the bright group are v476 cyg , gk per , v603 aql and v977 sco ; the faint group includes cp lac , v1500 cyg , v4157 sgr , and v351 pup .",
    "interestingly , both groups contain the same mixture of fe ii / he - n novae , co / onemg novae , so that there is no obvious parameter that influences the [ o iii ] luminosity .",
    "a clear outlier is v838 her , whose [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 luminosity is about 100 times fainter than all other objects , except v4160 sgr .",
    "the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 lines emerge earlier than in any other object .",
    "a fit through the points of v838 her yields : @xmath75      the strong late emission of h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 in gk per should be pointed out .",
    "gk per is a peculiar nova shell which seems to interact with interstellar material or a fossil planetary nebula ( seaquist et al .",
    "thus the ejected material shows shock interaction with the stationary circumstellar material , and remains in a hot state .",
    "the noticeable emission in the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 band of cp pup is due to n ii .",
    "cp pup has , however , also an unusually strong h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "smits ( 1991 ) has argued for a small distance ( between 525 and 850 pc ) for cp pup , which would lower the luminosity by factors 10 and 4 , respectively .",
    "the intricate geometry ( see downes & duerbeck ( 2000 ) for a detailed discussion ) makes these values less likely , although they would bring the h@xmath0 luminosity closer to the average value found in other very fast novae of this age .",
    "the peculiar case of v838 her has already been mentioned .",
    "this was the nova with the shortest @xmath32 and @xmath33 times of the light curve decay .",
    "v838 her appears to have less mass ejection , and thus a thin photosphere , which made the central object and its light changes appear after an unusually short time ( leibowitz et al . 1992 ) .",
    "it is important to note that the poorly observed nova v4160 sgr represents a second object of this rare class of rapidly fading neon novae with he - spectral characteristics .",
    "the three spectra available for v4160 sgr ( williams 2000 ) resemble those of v838 her ( vanlandingham et al .",
    "1996 ) at similar phases .        the trends in the evolution of line luminosities in the class of fast novae ( figs .",
    "4  6 ) differ somewhat from those of very fast novae .",
    "the scatter between individual objects in this group is less pronounced .",
    "there is only one extragalactic nova ( n lmc 1988 - 1 ) in the sample , which will be considered at the end .",
    "h@xmath0 emission is first recorded at @xmath76 ( 9 days after maximum ) , and slowly declines till @xmath77 ( 115 days after maximum ) by a factor 5 .",

    "after that , a steeper decline sets in .",
    "the extragalactic nova lies noticeably above the other objects .",
    "if it would be placed among the very fast novae ( and practically all other lmc novae are very fast novae ) , it would fit wery well into the corresponding diagrams .",

    "the similarity of the evolution of the slow nova pw vul with the majority of moderately fast novae has already been pointed out .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the decline in [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 is very similar in fast and moderately fast novae ( although [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 appears much earlier in fast novae ) .",
    "an important point is the unusually bright [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 luminosity determined for dq her 50 years after outburst .",
    "the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 filter exposure has certainly picked up emission of the line n ii 5005 , which was observed spectroscopically by williams et al .",
    "( 1978 ) at the endpoints of the major axis of the shell .",
    "indeed , the direct image of 1984 shows a deficit of emission along the minor axis .",
    "flux data are only available for a handful of novae , making general statements quite uncertain .",
    "the main string of data ( see figs .  10  12 ) , is from m31-c32 , a well - monitored extragalactic very slow nova .",
    "a few data points from v723 cas fall remarkably close to this object .",
    "thus it seems that the luminosity discrepancy between novae in m31 and the galaxy occurs only among very fast novae .",
    "note that some novae , like rr pic , hr del and v723 cas have an extended pre - maximum halt .",
    "because of the logarithmic plot , emission line fluxes are plotted only after maximum light .",
    "the number of studied objects is somewhat scarce , and the behavior of slow novae is quite varying , so these fits are not as representative as those for the other speed classes .",
    "the luminosity remains essentially constant between @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 days after maximum ) , and declines afterwards .    at times",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath120 with an average value @xmath121 , and at later times @xmath122 h@xmath0 emission from the shell is still observed in very old remnants .",

    "after 460 days , the slope becomes steeper .    at times",
    "@xmath119 , @xmath124 with an average value @xmath125 , and at later times @xmath126 h@xmath1 emission from the shell is still observed in very old remnants .      in slow novae , [ o  iii ]",
    "@xmath25007 emission appears at time @xmath127 , about 230 days after maximum .",
    "rr pic and hr del show almost constant [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 flux between the first appearance at 0.6 years up to @xmath88 , 3 years after maximum .",
    "the average @xmath128 , a fit through the points with @xmath129 yields @xmath130 in the following century , a drop @xmath131 is observed .",
    "note that the decline from maximum is documented only by data of hr del .",
    "a few very old remnants , rr pic , do aql and x ser still show [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission , which is , in two cases , documented by spectroscopy ( and thus confusion with n ii , as in cp pup and dq her , can be ruled out ) .",
    "such a behavior is at variance with all other types of classical novae , and indicates that a source of high energy photons , presumably from the nuclear burning in the outer layers of the white dwarf , is still active @xmath132 years after outburst .",
    "most notable are the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007-bright shells around old slow novae .",
    "at least three distinct groups of recurrent novae can be discriminated : very fast novae with dwarf companions , very fast novae with giant companions , and the slow recurrent nova t  pyx .",
    "the most extensive data set exists for the second group , and it is obvious that the other groups behave differently : the fast recurrent novae with dwarf secondaries show an extremely rapid decline of emission line strength in the balmer lines , and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 is basically absent ( see figs .",
    "13  15 ) .",
    "the slow recurrent nova t pyx shows , more than thirty years after its most recent outburst , persistently strong h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission , likely because of shock interaction of ejecta from different outbursts .      in the interval @xmath133 , recurrent novae with",

    "[ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission , caused by photoionization of the giant wind by the energetic radiation from the early outburst , has been reported for v745 sco .    noticeable emission in [ o  iii ]",
    "@xmath25007 starts to appear at @xmath138 , reaches a maximum at @xmath77 , and declines afterwards .",
    "a fit is uncertain for lack of secure data , but the average flux at times before one year is @xmath139 .",
    "t pyx is still bright in [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 30 years after the last outburst : interaction with previous shells keeps the ejecta hot , which appears to be untypical for other , faster recurrent novae .",
    "thus we refrain from merging data of very different objects , as we have also considered rn with dwarf and giant companions separately .",
    "we have collected about 1200 available line fluxes of 96 classical and recurrent novae of various speed classes and have studied the evolution of the luminosity in the h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 line as a function of time after outburst . in general , novae of a given speed class follow similar patterns , so that functional relations for the average evolution of line luminosity could be derived .",
    "general trends for novae of various speed classes are shown in figs .",
    "15 , 16 and 17 . a few novae turn out to be unusual : gk per and t pyx , which interact with circumstellar material , v838 her and v4160 sgr , which have unusually small mass ejection , and gq mus , an x - ray emitting classical nova .",
    "a general discussion of the material presented here in the framework of nova properties and shell evolution will be presented elsewhere ( duerbeck & downes 2002 ) .",

    "<S> the evolution of the luminosity of nova shells in the century following the nova outburst is studied for the lines h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 . </S>",
    "<S> about 1200 flux measurements from 96 objects have been collected from the literature , from unpublished observations , from the hst archive , or from new narrow - band filter imaging . for most objects , </S>",
    "<S> the distance and reddening is known ( or newly determined ) , and luminosities were calculated from the observed fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity data were combined in five groups , according to nova light curve type ( very fast , fast , moderately fast , slow , recurrent ) ; some objects were re - assigned to other groups for a better fit of the luminosity data to the general trend .    for very fast , fast and moderately fast novae , </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 decline is very similar , leading to a basic ` switchoff ' of [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission after 11 , 23 and 24 years , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for the same speed classes , the slope of the balmer luminosity is quite similar .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to all types of fast novae , the decline in balmer luminosity is more rapid in slow novae . </S>",
    "<S> however , the slope in [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 is more gentle ; slow novae still show [ o  iii ]  @xmath25007 emission after 100 years . </S>",
    "<S> thus shells of slow novae are still hot after one century ; the same applies for the shells of the very fast nova gk per and the recurrent nova t pyx , which interact with circumstellar material .    in recurrent novae , [ o  iii ]  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25007 is usually inconspicuous or absent . in objects with giant companions , </S>",
    "<S> the balmer luminosity decreases very slowly after an outburst , which may be an effect of line blending of material from the ejecta and the giant wind . on the other hand , objects with dwarf companions show a very rapid decline in balmer luminosity .    </S>",
