    "how a fluctuation relaxes in the equilibrium state is very important , not only in its own right , but also because it governs the transport behavior of a system in a nonequilibrium state .",
    "relaxation of a fluctuation is characterized by the corresponding correlation function , and according to the linear boltzmann and enskog equations , if a system is not in a critical region , in general its correlation functions are believed to decay exponentially at long times @xcite .",
    "consequently , the integral of a flux autocorrelation function , which appears in the green - kubo formula , converges and thus guarantees a size - independent transport coefficient  @xcite . until the late 1960s , the viewpoint that correlation functions decay exponentially had been prevailing",
    "however , after alder and wainwright  @xcite numerically evidenced the long - time tail of velocity autocorrelation in gas models in 1970 , extensive analytical and numerical studies suggested that in one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) momentum - conserving systems , the heat current autocorrelation function ( hcaf ) generally decays in power - law manners instead .",
    "( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews and more literatures . )",
    "the hcaf is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the equilibrium thermodynamic average and @xmath4 is the total heat current . for 1d momentum - conserving systems",
    ", a recent analytical study has summarized that @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , for systems with symmetric and asymmetric interparticle interactions  @xcite . for 2d momentum - conserving systems  @xcite ,",
    "the decaying exponent is @xmath8 .",
    "an important consequence of the power - law decay is the divergence of the heat conductivity for @xmath9 following the green - kubo formula  @xcite @xmath10 here @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are , respectively , the heat conductivity , the temperature , the dimension , and the volume of the system , and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "it implies that low dimensional ( i.e. , 1d or 2d ) materials , such as nanowires and graphene flakes , may possess an anomalous thermal transport property . at present ,",
    "this viewpoint  that the hcaf of low dimensional momentum - conserving systems generally decays in power - law manners  is a mainstream viewpoint that has also been accepted by experimentalists .    nevertheless ,",
    "in a recent numerical study  @xcite , it has been found that in 1d momentum - conserving lattices with asymmetric interparticle interactions , the heat conductivity may turn out to be independent of the system size .",
    "this finding implies that in such a system , the hcaf may decay faster than power - law manners , or in a power - law manner but with @xmath16 .",
    "later , faster decay has also been observed in several other 1d momentum - conserving lattices with asymmetric interactions  @xcite .",
    "the faster decay behavior is in clear contrast with existing theories and has significant importance . on one hand",
    ", it requires us to revisit the theories developed for low dimensional transport problem during last decades ; on the other hand , it implies that realistic low dimensional materials , such as nanowires and graphene flakes , may still follow the well - known fourier heat conduction law  @xcite , because real materials usually show the thermal expansion effect , which is a consequence of asymmetric interparticle interactions .",
    "this problem hence deserves careful studies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore if there exists any link between asymmetric interparticle interactions and the decaying behavior of the hcaf in 1d momentum - conserving lattices .",
    "the model we focus on is the lennard - jones ( l - j ) lattices , whose interaction asymmetry degree depends on both the temperature and a pair of system parameters . we show that in wide ranges of temperature and system parameters , this model has a high asymmetry degree and the hcaf decays faster than any power - law manners .",
    "nonequilibrium simulations also confirm that it has a size - independent heat conductivity .",
    "the fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath1-@xmath0 ( fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 ) model is also studied .",
    "this model has asymmetric interaction but faster decay of its hcaf has not been reported yet  @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that in clear contrast to intuition , the effects of asymmetric interactions , such as thermal expansion , do not vanish in the low temperature regime ; rather , it becomes even stronger in some sense .",
    "in this regime , fast decay of the hcaf , that may lead to normal heat conduction , is observed as well . to make a comparison",
    ", we also study the hcaf of the fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath0 ( fpu-@xmath0 ) model of symmetric interaction , in such a low temperature regime .",
    "our results suggest that under proper conditions , asymmetric interactions may lead to the fast decay of the hcaf , i.e. , certain correlation may exist between fast decay of the hcaf and asymmetric interactions .",
    "this finding could be a helpful clue for further studies on the hcaf .",
    "as the two lattice models of asymmetric interactions ( l - j model and fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 ) are general in some sence , we suspect such correlation may also be found in other asymmetric lattices with proper parameter values . nevertheless , we point out that at present the exact conditions for observing such correlation are not clear yet , and it would be risky to interpret such correlation as a cause - effect relationship .",
    "these problems deserve more efforts and should be clarified in future .",
    "we adopt molecular dynamics studies for our aim here . at present",
    "numerical analysis plays an important role in studying the heat conduction properties of low dimensional systems .",
    "although the problem can be dealt with analytically , certain approximations and assumptions have to be resorted to . for example , in analytical studies , it has been generally assumed that all slow variables of relevance for the long - time behavior of hydrodynamics and the related time correlation functions are the long - wavelength fourier components of the conserved quantities densities  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , particular attention must be paid when analytical results are compared with simulation and experiment results  @xcite . as to experimental studies , despite the fact that in recent years it has become technically feasible to measure the heat conductivity of low dimensional materials , the accessible precision is still far away for drawing convincing conclusions . in addition , realistic materials studied in laboratories , such as nanowires and graphene flakes , may not be genuine 1d and 2d objects , considering their possible transverse motions .",
    "hence , how to control or evaluate the effects of the transverse motions turns out to be a new experimental challenge .",
    "in contrast , the molecular dynamics method does not suffer from any of these problems .",
    "however , it has its own difficulty : the finite - size effect , which often makes it hard to reach consensus on the simulation results  @xcite .",
    "inevitably , our study in this paper will also face the doubt whether our results can be extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "regarding to this concern , by taking the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath17 model as an example , we will show that , even though the fourier heat conduction behavior observed with finite system sizes does not hold up to an infinite system eventually , it does hold up to a physically meaningful macroscopic system .",
    "in the following we shall first describe the lattice model of lennard - jones potential and present the simulation results ; then we shall turn to the asymmetric , fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath1-@xmath0 ( fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 ) model .",
    "a brief summary and discussion will be presented in the last section .",
    "the lennard - jones ( l - j ) potential has been widely adopted in modeling realistic materials .",
    "it is asymmetric with respect to the equilibrium point , and our study has shown that in 1d lattices with l - j potentials , the hcaf can decay faster than power - law manners  @xcite .",
    "this finding is in clear contrast to the well known theoretical prediction of the power - law decay .",
    "the hamiltonian of a 1d lattice with the nearest neighboring coupling can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 represent , respectively , the momentum , the position , the mass of the @xmath23th particle and the potential between two neighboring particles . for both models we study in the following ,",
    "we assume that all the component particles are identical and have unit mass ; i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "the lattice constant is set to be unity so that the system length @xmath25 equals the particle number @xmath26 . in our simulations for the hcaf",
    ", the periodic boundary condition is imposed , and the total momentum of the system is set to be zero .",
    "note that in 1d lattices , if there is no steady motion ( i.e. , the total momentum is zero ) , then the heat current equals the energy current  @xcite ; hence our results can be extended to the energy current straightforwardly .",
    "we consider the total heat current defined as @xmath27 @xcite . to numerically measure the heat current in the equilibrium state ,",
    "the system is first evolved from an appropriately assigned random initial condition for a long enough time ( @xmath28 in our simulations ) to ensure that it has relaxed to the equilibrium state , then the total heat current at ensuing times is measured . the energy density , or the energy per particle , denoted by @xmath29 ,",
    "is determined by the initial condition and is conserved during the simulation . at the low temperature regime , by using the viral theorem , we have @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the averaged potential energy per particle at the equilibrium state .",
    "( note that this relation holds only when the harmonic term dominates the potential ; hence only applies at the low temperature regime . )",
    "the boltzmann constant is set to be unity throughout .",
    "the l - j potential we consider has the form @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "it involves a pair of parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , that control the asymmetry degree of the potential . without loss of generality , in the following we fix @xmath35 so that the minimum of @xmath36 is fixed at @xmath37 .",
    "the potential is asymmetric with respect to the equilibrium point [ see fig .",
    "1(a ) ] . in order to compare the asymmetry degree for different @xmath38 and at different temperatures , we introduce the following measure of the asymmetry degree : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are , respectively , the right- and the left - side zero point of @xmath42 , with @xmath43 being the average potential energy between two neighboring particles , or the average potential energy per particle . note that @xmath44 represents expansion and @xmath45 is equivalent to the thermal expansion coefficient upon a factor of the heat capacity  @xcite . as @xmath45 captures and reflects thermal effects of asymmetric interactions , it is a natural and physically meaningful choice to measure the asymmetry degree . as fig .",
    "1(b ) shows , the asymmetry degree of the l - j potential increases as the average potential energy @xmath46 , and for a fixed @xmath46 value it increases as the parameter pair @xmath38 varies from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .        we will focus on the case of @xmath47 , the most frequently adopted parameters in literatures , but",
    "also discuss other values of @xmath38 when it is in order . in fig .",
    "2 we show the simulation results of the hcaf .",
    "we have performed the finite - size effect analysis as outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite and found that in 1d l - j lattices , the finite - size effect is in fact negligible , which is very favorable for numerical studies of the hcaf . thanks to this property , the asymptotic decaying behavior of @xmath49 can be reliably revealed even with a comparatively small system of @xmath50 ( @xmath26 is the total number of particles in the system ) . to show this property , in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) the hcaf at different system sizes are compared for @xmath47 and @xmath51 , respectively . the energy density @xmath52 , i.e.",
    ", the average energy per particle , is fixed at @xmath53 , which corresponds to the temperature of @xmath54 and the average potential energy per particle @xmath55 .",
    "it can be seen that in both cases , all the curves of @xmath56 perfectly collapse onto one upon scaling by the system size @xmath26 .",
    "this evidence strongly suggests that the finite - size effects are negligible for @xmath57 .",
    "note that the oscillating tails around zero for @xmath58 appear in fig .",
    "2(a ) [ also in fig .",
    "2(c ) and fig .",
    "2(d ) ] are due to uncertainty of statistical average of @xmath59 [ see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] , and the negative parts of the oscillations are not shown as the vertical axis is in the logarithmic scale .",
    "it shows clearly in fig .",
    "2(a ) that the hcaf decays faster than any power - law manners .",
    "the inset presents the data in the semi - log scale , from which one can see that the decay manner is already very close to an exponential one .",
    "2(b ) shows the results for @xmath51 , and @xmath49 curves can be regarded as decaying exponentially with certainty .",
    "it can be found from fig .",
    "1(b ) that the l - j potential with @xmath51 has relatively higher asymmetry degree ; we thus conjecture the higher the asymmetry degree is , the closer the decaying behavior of the hcaf tends to be exponential . to check this conjecture , in fig .",
    "2(c ) we compare the hcaf for various @xmath38 values .",
    "it shows that , as @xmath38 varies from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , i.e. , as the asymmetry degree increases [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , the @xmath49 curve in the semi - log scale becomes straighter and straighter [ see the inset of fig .",
    "2(c ) ] , suggesting that the decaying behavior indeed tends to be exponential progressively .    as fig .",
    "1(b ) shows , for a given parameter pair @xmath38 , the asymmetry degree is controlled by the average potential energy per particle @xmath62 : it increases dramatically as the latter .",
    "as the temperature monotonically increases with @xmath62 , it implies that the temperature could also be correlated to the decaying behavior of the hcaf : for the l - j model at a higher temperature , the average potential per particle is higher and consequently , the potential s asymmetry degree would be higher [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . in fig .",
    "2(d ) the temperature dependence of the decaying behavior of the hcaf is studied for @xmath47 with @xmath52=0.5 , 1 , and 2 . for these @xmath52 values ,",
    "the corresponding temperature is @xmath630.55 , 1.2 , and 2.4 , and the corresponding @xmath64 is about 0.2 , 0.4 , and 0.8 .",
    "again , the @xmath49 curve in the semi - log scale [ see the inset of fig .",
    "2(d ) ] becomes straighter and straighter and at @xmath65=1 , it has already become a perfect exponential function .",
    "this again confirms that the decaying behavior of the hcaf is correlated to the asymmetry degree . following the green - kubo formula",
    "( 2 ) ] , the fact that @xmath49 decays faster than the power law of @xmath66 suggests that the integral of @xmath49 is convergent .",
    "in addition , for @xmath67 , the fact that @xmath68 curves for different system sizes agree with each other as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and ( b ) implies that the thermal conductivity does not depend on the system size . in fig .",
    "3 , we present the heat conductivity given by the green - kubo formula . note that in order to get rid of the possible finite - size effect , a practical procedure for obtaining the heat conductivity at a given system size @xmath26 , denoted by @xmath69 , is to truncate the time integration in the green - kubo formula  lepri , pros up to the time @xmath70 ( @xmath71 is the sound speed of the system )  @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath72 it can be seen from fig .",
    "3 that @xmath73 increases as @xmath26 for @xmath74 but gets saturated for larger @xmath26 , which is in good consistence with the results of @xmath68 [ see fig .",
    "2(a ) ] .        to further verify the convergence of the heat conductivity ,",
    "we have also computed it directly by using the nonequilibrium simulations : two langevin heat bathes  @xcite with with temperatures @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , are connected to the two ends of an l - j lattice .",
    "after the stationary state is established , the heat conductivity is evaluated by assuming the fourier law @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the temperature gradient along the lattice . the results ( denoted by @xmath80 )",
    "are also presented in fig . 3 for a close comparison .",
    "again , the heat conductivity measured in this way tends to saturate and the value it tends to is the same as that obtained by integrating the hcaf with the green - kubo formula .    to summarize ,",
    "1d l - j lattices obey the fourier law at large system sizes , and their hcaf decay faster than power - law manners .",
    "this conclusion is not affected by the finite - size effects .",
    "the potential of the 1d fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model is @xmath83 where the two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath84 determine , respectively , the asymmetric and the symmetric nonlinear term . as our aim is to investigate the effects induced by the asymmetric term , we fix @xmath85 throughout . fig .",
    "4(a ) shows the potential for three different values of @xmath1 , and fig .",
    "4(b ) shows the corresponding result of the asymmetry degree .    from fig .",
    "4(b ) it can be seen that the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model is quite different from the l - j model : though in general the asymmetry degree increases as @xmath1 , it generally decreases and tends to zero as the average potential energy @xmath64 increases .",
    "in addition , for larger @xmath1 the asymmetry degree may depend on @xmath64 in a nonmonotonic manner as in the case of @xmath1=1.5 . at the first glance ,",
    "these results seem to contradict to our intuition ; e.g. , when the temperature tends to zero , @xmath64 decreases accordingly , and the potential energy represented by the quadratic term in the potential function would become dominant . for this reason , one may expect that the physical properties of the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model would converge to those of a harmonic lattice .",
    "however , we would like to point out that , for some nonlinear effects , such as thermal expansion , the cubic term in the potential function is always the leading term ; hence whether a nonlinear effect is non - negligible in the low temperature limit depends on if it could stand out from the linear effect . as far as thermal expansion is concerned , in the low temperature",
    "limit the thermal expansion coefficient tends to be a temperature independent constant proportional to @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 being , respectively , the coefficient of the cubic and the quadratic term of the taylor expansion of the given potential function ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model @xmath89 ; i.e. , the larger is @xmath1 , the larger is the thermal expansion coefficient , which is in good consistence with the results of the asymmetry degree given in fig .",
    "[ note that for the l - j model , the thermal expansion coefficient does not tend to zero in the low temperature limit either , and the value of @xmath90 for various parameter @xmath38 is also in consistence with the results given in fig .",
    "1(b ) . ]",
    "if the decaying behavior of the hcaf is correlated to the asymmetry degree , then based on fig .",
    "4(b ) , we could expect that faster decay may be observed in the low temperature regime where the asymmetry degree is high enough . in the high temperature regime",
    ", the asymmetry degree tends to be low , which is consistent with the fact that as the temperature increases , the symmetric quartic term becomes overwhelmingly dominating so that the expansion quantity @xmath91 tends to be a constant , inducing in turn a decreasing thermal expansion rate . as a result , one may expect instead slow decay of the hcaf .",
    "4(b ) also tells that the asymmetry degree is relatively strong only at low temperatures , in particular for the potential with a smaller value of @xmath92 . to reveal the effects of the asymmetric potential , we first investigate the hcaf at a very low energy density of @xmath93 . for this energy density",
    ", we have @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "5(a ) we show the hcaf for @xmath1=0.5 , 1 , and 1.5 with @xmath96 ; it can be seen that for @xmath97 , before the fluctuations ( due to uncertainty of statistical average ) set in , @xmath49 decays more rapidly  in an exponential - like way  than any power - law manners in all three cases .",
    "in addition , we have also verified that for all these cases @xmath68 does not change as @xmath26 as long as @xmath98 .",
    "now let us turn to the case of a high temperature : @xmath99 , which corresponds to @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "compared with the low temperature case , it can be seen from fig .",
    "4 ( b ) that the asymmetry degree has greatly diminished . in this case , the hcaf does show a power - law tail with the decaying exponent close to 2/3 [ see fig .",
    "5(b ) ] as predicted by the self - consistent mode coupling theory  @xcite .    fig .",
    "5(b ) also suggests that the hcaf undergoes an initial faster decaying stage which lasts longer and longer with the increase of @xmath1 .",
    "this is a signal that the asymmetric potential term even plays a role in the high temperature regime ; i.e. , higher asymmetry degree can maintain a longer initial faster decaying stage . it can be expected that if the temperature is increased further , the effects induced by the asymmetric potential will become even more unnoticeable due to the rapid decrease of the asymmetric degree .",
    "this has been verified by our simulations .    concerning the results given in fig .",
    "5(a ) , one may wonder if there exists a crossover from the exponential - like decay to the power - law decay even at low temperatures , but the time corresponding to the crossover point , denoted by @xmath102 , is so long that has gone beyond the scope of our simulations . to study this question",
    ", we computed the hcaf at several low temperatures with @xmath103 and @xmath104 [ see fig .",
    "it can be seen that such a crossover may exist and @xmath105 may increase very fast as the temperature decreases .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to argue that , even though the hcaf turns out to have a power - law tail , _ in practice _ the faster decay before the power - law tail can still guarantee an effective constant heat conductivity  @xcite , as long as the faster decaying stage lasts sufficiently long . to show this",
    ", we calculate the heat conductivity for a finite system size @xmath26 by using the green - kubo formula and divide the integral of @xmath49 into two parts ; i.e. , @xmath106.\\ ] ] in the time range of the second integral , i.e. , @xmath107 , the hcaf is assumed to decay as @xmath108 .",
    "taking the case of @xmath109 as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) as an example , where one can see that the initial rapid decay lasts up to @xmath110 and @xmath111 drops to about @xmath112 ; then the first integral @xmath113 and the second integral @xmath114 .",
    "it follows that the contribution of the power - law tail ( given by the second integral ) to the heat conductivity is not comparable to that of the faster decaying part until the system size reaches up to @xmath115 , given that  @xcite @xmath116 . in other words ,",
    "if we suppose that the average distance between two neighboring particles is one angstrom , then the heat conductivity would keep in effect unchanged over a wide system size range from about one micrometer to ten centimeters .",
    "so as long as the faster decay stage @xmath117 lasts long enough , as evidenced in fig .",
    "5(a ) , even though we assume that the hcaf has a power law tail , its influence to the heat conduction can still be safely neglected .        above analysis",
    "raises a relevant question : if these properties remain in the fpu-@xmath0 model . in fig .",
    "6(b ) , we show the hcaf at several temperatures for the fpu-@xmath0 model with @xmath104 .",
    "roughly , its behavior looks similar as in the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model [ see fig .",
    "6(a ) ] , in that there is a fast decay stage followed by a slow power - law tail .",
    "however , qualitative difference exists : for fpu-@xmath0 model , the decay behavior of hcaf is of power - law rather than exponential - like , and is slower than @xmath118 throughout [ see fig .",
    "6(b ) ] . as a result ,",
    "the thermal conductivity for fpu-@xmath0 model would increase with the system size significantly .",
    "in summary , we have numerically studied the hcaf in the 1d l - j lattices .",
    "it has been shown that the hcaf generally decays faster than power - law manners .",
    "in addition , we have observed a correlation between the decaying behavior of the hcaf and the interaction asymmetry degree : as the system parameters @xmath119 change from @xmath120 to ( 2,1 ) , the asymmetry degree increases , and meanwhile the hcaf tends to decay more and more exponentially . in particular , for @xmath121 , the hcaf shows clear signal of exponential decay . on the other hand , the asymmetry degree increases as the average potential energy per particle , or equivalently the temperature .",
    "again , the hcaf tends to decay exponentially as the temperature increases .",
    "we have also studied the decaying behavior of the hcaf in the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath17 model .",
    "while the asymmetry degree increases with the asymmetry parameter @xmath1 , its dependence on temperature is quite different from that of the l - j model : in the high temperature regime , the asymmetry degree decreases monotonically as the average potential energy per particle increases , in consistence with the fact that the symmetric quartic term in the potential becomes dominating .",
    "we show that in the low temperature regime the exponential - like fast decay of the hcaf can last for a significantly long time though a power - law tail may follow .",
    "one important question that can not be definitely answered via numerical simulations only is whether the power - law tail would show up if the system size is out of the scope accessible to simulations .",
    "our observation is that there are not any signals of the power - law tail in the l - j model with all the system parameters investigated .",
    "however , as to the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model , we can not exclude such a possibility based on our present simulation results .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that for the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model at a low temperature , even if the hcaf has a power - law tail eventually , effective constant heat conductivity can still be expected if only the initial faster decay lasts long enough . in particular , if the hcaf keeps decaying faster over more than three orders , the contribution of the assumed power - law tail to the heat conductivity can be neglected even when the system reaches a macroscopic scale .",
    "namely , the slow tail of the hcaf may not necessarily imply abnormal transport _ in practice _",
    ", hence should be carefully analyzed when theoretical predictions based on the power - law tail are applied to experiments .",
    "( it is worth noting that though for the fpu-@xmath0 model there is also a fast decaying period in low - temperature regime , the decaying rate is slower than @xmath122 . )",
    "based on these analysis , we conclude that with proper system parameters , both the l - j model and the fpu-@xmath92-@xmath0 model ( at a sufficient low temperature ) may have the normal heat conduction property given by the fourier law .",
    "as realistic materials usually contain asymmetric interactions , we think this result may be significant to applications as well .    in a recent work , heat conduction of 1d l - j lattices",
    "was studied  @xcite at different particle densities .",
    "though the authors did not show how the hcaf decays , they provided the convergent heat conductivity at low temperature regime by using the green - kubo formula , which implies that the hcaf decays faster than @xmath122 .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier conclusion on this model  @xcite . in that work",
    "@xcite , the authors also conjectured that the lattices with the parabolic and/or quartic confining potential , to which the fermi - pasta - ulam model belongs , should all exhibit anomalous heat transport .",
    "our study suggests that their conjecture should be studied further because as we have shown here , the heat conduction behavior of the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model can also be normal .",
    "in addition , normal heat conduction has also been evidenced in other lattices with confining potential  @xcite , such as the piecewise parabolic potential  @xcite .",
    "therefore , more efforts are still needed to unveil the exact conditions under which the hcaf decays faster .",
    "finally , we emphasize that asymmetric interactions are not a sufficient condition for the faster decay of the hcaf and normal heat conduction , just as suggested by the results of the fpu-@xmath1-@xmath0 model at high temperatures .",
    "asymmetric interactions may not be a necessary condition for the faster decay of the hcaf and normal heat conduction , either .",
    "to this end , the 1d rotator lattice  @xcite is the only known example .",
    "this model has normal heat conductivity under certain conditions , but its interaction is symmetric .",
    "however , recent studies suggest that the angle variables of this model do not constitute a conserved field @xcite , implying that this model is in effect irrelevant with the subject we discuss here . it is worth noting that if this example is excluded , then all the 1d momentum - conserving systems where the hcaf has been reported to decay faster up to now have asymmetric interactions  @xcite .",
    "recently , two more model systems have also been added to this category : 1d hard - point gas and 1d toda lattice with alternative masses  @xcite .",
    "the faster decay of the hcaf and normal heat conduction are found in both models in certain range of the system size when the mass ratio tends to unity , i.e. , when the systems approach their integerable limit .",
    "taking into account all these studies , the faster decay of the hcaf seems to be a collective consequence of some different factors to which asymmetric interactions belong .",

    "<S> we study the heat current autocorrelation function ( hcaf ) in one - dimensional , momentum - conserving lattices . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we explore if there is any relation between the decaying characteristics of the hcaf and asymmetric interparticle interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the lennard - jones model is intensively investigated in view of its significance to applications . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that in wide ranges of parameters , the hcaf decays faster than power - law manners , and in some cases it decays even exponentially . following the green - kubo formula </S>",
    "<S> , the fast decay of hcaf implies the convergence of heat conductivity , which is also corroborated by numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with a comparison to the fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath0 model of symmetric interaction , the hcaf of the fermi - pasta - ulam-@xmath1-@xmath0 model of asymmetric interaction is also investigated . </S>",
    "<S> our study suggests that , in certain ranges of parameters , the decaying behavior of the hcaf is correlated to the asymmetry degree of interaction . </S>"
