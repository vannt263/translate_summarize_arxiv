    "may result in a type ic supernova , while stars more massive than 8 produce a type ii supernova . for a population of 2000 single stars",
    "we then expect @xmath7 type ic and @xmath8 type ii supernovae .",
    "( note that this estimate does not include binaries , and is therefore inapplicable to type ia and ib supernovae . )",
    "we compare these numbers with purely binary evolution models of portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 ) . according their model ak ,",
    "the type ic supernova rate is enhanced compared to models of only single stars . in the non - dynamical models ( w4-nd and w6-nd ) ,",
    "type ia and ib supernovae occur without affecting the other supernova types .",
    "one reason for this is the fact that many type ib supernova originate from stars that were once part of a mass - transferring binary .",
    "the primary star in these binaries tends to lose its envelope in a phase of mass transfer and explode in a type ib supernova . the companion star ,",
    "although initially not massive enough to experience a supernova , may accrete some material from the primary star .",
    "this accreted material may be sufficient to raise the secondary star s mass over the limit for experiencing a supernova .",
    "stellar mass is , in a sense , recycled to produce more supernovae ( see also portegies zwart & yungelson 1999 )",
    ".    the relative numbers of supernova types ia : ib / c : ii for the 8 model clusters ( models w4 and w6 combined ) are 0.18:0.27:0.55 ; in the models where stellar dynamics is ignored these ratio are 0.05:0.34:0.61 .",
    "the addition of dynamical interactions to the models enhances the type ia supernova rate at the expense of the type ib / c and type ii supernova rates .",
    "the enhancement of type - ib / c supernova in model w4 is due to close ( post mass transfer ) binaries , possibly because these binaries experience more dynamical encounters during the shallow collapse of the cluster core ( see the discussion in  [ sect : evolution ] ) .",
    "only two binaries survive their first supernova .",
    "one remains bound because the supernova results in a black hole , which does not receive a velocity kick .",
    "this binary experiences a second phase of mass transfer ( see  [ sect : x - ray ] for details ) .",
    "the other surviving binary is the result of a supernova in a rather short - period binary with a main - sequence companion .",
    "the resultant neutron star receives only a mild kick and the binary remains bound .",
    "later this binary becomes an x - ray source ( see  [ sect : x - ray ] for details ) .",
    "two supernovae are triggered by collisions between carbon stars , resulting in type ia events , and one type ii supernova follows a collision between two supergiants .",
    "one neutron star is shot into its 1.9 main sequence companion following a supernova .",
    "the resulting collision product , a thorn - zytkow star , is ejected from the star cluster before collapsing to a black hole .",
    "only two out of 29 binaries survive the formation of a neutron star and one survives the formation of a black hole .",
    "a total of six black holes result from type ic supernovae .",
    "figure [ fig : w46_tsupernova ] gives the time history of the supernovae in models w4 and w6 .",
    "first black holes ( bullets ) are formed , followed by neutron stars ( circles , triangles and plus signs ) .",
    "the supernovae in the w4 models seem to occur somewhat earlier than in the w6 models , but the mean time at which a supernova occurs , 23.3myr and 23.5myr for models w4 and w6 , respectively , are not significantly different .",
    "the formation of a black hole at 46myr in model w6 is the result of a radio pulsar colliding with its carbon - star companion ( see  [ sect : x - ray ] ) .",
    "the high binary fractions in our models result in frequent episodes of mass transfer .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : w46_first ] , which shows the distribution of the times of first roche - lobe contact in models w4 and w6 .",
    "the various symbols indicate the state of the donor at the moment of first contact .",
    "( note that helium stars , although likely to be the remnant of an earlier phase of mass transfer , are still counted in this figure . ) .    in most cases the mass",
    "is transferred to a main - sequence star , except in the cases indicated with @xmath9 , where the mass transfer is onto a compact object ( mostly a white dwarf ) . in the majority of these latter cases",
    "the donor is a ( sub)giant , but there are two occasions where the donor is a helium star , and in one case a main - sequence star ( see figure [ fig : w46_cv ] .",
    "one episode of mass transfer occurs between a ( sub ) giant and a black hole ( model w4 at @xmath10myr ) .",
    "the time histories of models w4 are significantly different from those of models w6 , according to a @xmath11 test on the cumulative distributions of figure [ fig : w46_first ] . in the w4 models",
    ", mass transfer tends to occur earlier than in the w6 models . as discussed above , the difference is a result of the greater dynamical activity during the early phase of model w4 .",
    "in fact , the higher binary activity in this case is caused by the early phase of shallow core collapse in the w4 models , which does not occur in the w6 models .",
    "mass transfer from a hydrogen- or helium - burning star onto a compact object generally leads to an x - ray phase .",
    "figure [ fig : w46_cv ] shows the distribution of orbital periods ( in days ) at the onset of roche - lobe overflow for binaries with white - dwarf ( in one case a black hole ) accretor .",
    "note the clear distinction between main - sequence and helium - star donors at short orbital periods and giant donors at larger periods .",
    "the wide systems with giant donors are probably most comparable to the supersoft sources ( x - ray binaries where a white dwarf accretes at a super - eddington rate for a solar - mass object , emitting at a rate of about @xmath12 erg / s ) .    a peculiar object which might be observable as an x - ray source results from a binary in which a helium giant ( 2.5 ) transfers mass to a 1.17 carbon - oxygen white dwarf .",
    "first contact occurs at 45.9myr at an orbital period of 1.7 days .",
    "when the carbon star explodes and becomes a neutron star ( at 46.07myr ) it receives a kick of only 16 . at that moment the companion star still fills its roche lobe , and as a result the two stars coalesce into a single object .",
    "the merger product collapses a little later to form a 2.42 black hole .",
    "long - lived triples and higher - order systems pose severe challenges to any numerical code .",
    "we encountered a total of 41 long - lived multiples in our runs , 21 triples [ 4 quadruples ] in w4 and 13 triples [ 3 quadruples ] in w6 .",
    "only one of the quadruple systems is hierarchical ; the others are binary - binary systems .",
    "the first multiple systems form as early as 20myr ( by a binary - binary interaction ) ; some survive for as long as 900myr",
    ". figure [ fig : w46_tp_triple ] presents an overview of all triples in all models from @xmath13 to 600myr .",
    "( at later times the numbers of triples decrease as the clusters dissolve . )",
    "the orbital period of the outer binary is generally rather constant .",
    "this is not surprising as , for the triple to be long - lived , it must be hierarchical and isolated , and the orbital energies and hence periods are adiabatic invariants .",
    "the systems showing a significant period derivative are driven by binary evolution or by temporary close encounters with other cluster members .",
    "the fractions of long - lived triple and quadruple systems in our models are only @xmath14% and @xmath15% , respectively , considerably smaller than the fraction of triples observed in the galactic field ( 2.6% , duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) or in the pleiades cluster ( @xmath16% , mermilliod et al . 1990 , 1992 ) .",
    "note also that these are the total numbers of multiple systems created at any time during our simulations .",
    "the mean lifetime of such a system is @xmath17myr .",
    "we can study the population of short - lived multiple systems by selecting a bound pair of stars and searching for a third nearby star which forms a bound subsystem . at any moment in time",
    "the number of such short - lived multiple systems is about twice as high as the number of persistent triples . at @xmath18myr",
    "we counted a total of 46 bound multiple systems in all models ( w4 and w6 ) , implying in a triple frequency of about 0.6% per star . for comparison , kroupa ( 1995 ) found a triple fraction of 0.5% using a similar technique .",
    "the outer orbits of these triples , however , are generally rather soft .    nine collision products in our models w4 became members of persistent triples or quadruples .",
    "these collisions occured in transient triples . in about half ( 5 ) the cases , the two stars in the inner binary collided while the intruding star remained bound to the merged star .",
    "( for definiteness , we take the `` inner '' orbit in a quadruple system to be the larger of the two inner orbits . ) in a few cases ( 3 ) , the merger product and its companion became bound to another third star , forming a stable triple . in two of these cases , the encounter resulted in second collision with the merger product .",
    "both these triple collisions resulted in blue stragglers which had , at some time , a mass exceeding twice the turnoff mass of the cluster .    of the total of 117 collisions in the w4 models , nine occured in transient triple systems . with a triple frequency of only @xmath19% ,",
    "one naively expects less than one collision to occur in triples , making the frequency of collisions in triples unusually high . in part",
    ", this higher fraction of collisions in multiples is due to the dynamics  such systems generally form close to the cluster center , where the stellar density is highest and most collisions are expected .",
    "in addition , collision products tend to be found near the center , because they are more massive than average .",
    "the higher combined mass of three stars and the relatively large cross section of the outer orbit also increases the collision probability .",
    "similar circumstances led to the high collision rates observed in the r136 simulations of portegies zwart et al.(1999 , see also portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ) .",
    "thus , triples are favorable for collisions , and collision products favor triple systems",
    ".    we can characterize the triple systems formed in our simulations as follows : all inner orbits have periods less then 100year with an average of about 5.1 years .",
    "all outer orbital periods exceed 100year and have an average of about 4600 years .",
    "the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits are quite distinct .",
    "the inner orbits have generally rather small eccentricies ( @xmath20 ) and its distribution is consistent at a 98.8% level with the inner eccentricity distribution of observed triples ( tokovinin 1997 ) .",
    "the distribution of outer eccentricities ( @xmath21 ) is consistent with thermal .",
    "the simulations reported by mcmillan and hut ( 1994 ) used up to 2048 stars , with up to 20% ( rather soft : @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) primordial binaries , and included the galactic tidal field .",
    "however , they excluded stellar evolution and hence any stellar mass loss . in the absence of a physical time",
    "scale associated with stellar evolution , they presented their results in units of the initial relaxation time .",
    "our w6 models have half lives of about 6 initial relaxation times , much shorter than the @xmath2430 initial relaxation times for the most comparable mcmillan & hut models .",
    "stellar mass loss is the main reason for the more rapid dissolution of our models ; in addition , the mcmillan & hut runs all began with the cluster well inside its jacobi surface , so the clusters had to expand significantly before significant tidal mass loss occurred . as discussed previously ,",
    "all the mcmillan & hut models experienced core collapse , which is not seen in our simulations , where core collapse is arrested by stellar mass loss .",
    "mcmillan & hut found that the binary fraction in their simulations first fell due to as binaries were destroyed by interactions with other binaries in the cluster core , then rose again at late times as the cluster evaporated in the galactic tidal field .",
    "in contrast , we find that the ( initially @xmath25% ) binary fraction in our models remains roughly constant throughout the calculation , then increases significantly to @xmath3% when only @xmath26% of the cluster mass remains .",
    "these differences are most likely attributable to the lack of significant core collapse and the stronger tidal fields in our runs .",
    "one of the most interesting conclusions made by mcmillan & hut is that the spatial distribution of hard binaries is different than the distribution of soft binaries ( see their figure 9 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : w46_rfbin ] we showed that hard binaries @xmath27 ) are slightly more centrally concentrated than average .",
    "the main difference between our calculations and those of kroupa ( 1995 ) is his neglect of binary evolution and his inclusion of a prescription for pre - main - sequence binaries .",
    "the eccentricity distribution of his primordial binaries was therefore somewhat different from ours , but this affects only binaries with the highest eccentricities and the shortest orbital periods . on the other hand , his neglect of binary evolution underestimated the fraction of tidally circularized binaries . in his calculations",
    "the boundary between hard and soft binaries was at an orbital period of roughly @xmath28years , similar to that in our models w4 .",
    "we have already compared the characteristics of the populations of triple systems in our calculations ( see  [ sect : triples ] ) .",
    "de la fuente marcos ( 1997 ) performed studies of the evolution of small ( @xmath29 ) , tidally limited open clusters having a variety of initial mass functions , with and without the inclusion of stellar ( but not binary ) evolution .",
    "all models started with a substantial fraction ( 1/3 ) of primordial binaries having mass ratios of 0.5 and energies in the @xmath30@xmath31 range .",
    "he found that the dissolution time scale of his models depended quite sensitively on the choice of imf , and that the binary population shortly before dissolution could show characteristic features allowing remnants of rich and poor clusters to be distinguished observationally .",
    "it is unclear how these results extend to larger systems .    the binary fraction in the de la fuente marcos simulations ranged from 33% initially to about @xmath32% near the disruption of the cluster ( averaged over all 20 of his simulations ) .",
    "by the time the clusters dissolved , the binary fraction in the core had dropped to @xmath33 .",
    "we find a similar increase in the total binary fraction , but clearly the core binary fraction in our models is much higher ( see figure [ fig : w46_rfbin ] ) .",
    "the small binary fractions in the core near the end of his simulations are the direct result of his choice of initial binary binding energies .",
    "the comparison between the relative collision frequencies in tab.[tab : w6_bin ] and those of model @xmath34 in paper i are quite striking . in that paper only encounters between single stars were studied and primordial binaries were neglected .",
    "still , in paper i 77% of all collisions occurred between two main - sequence stars , and 14% between a main - sequence star and a giant ; the remaining 9% involved giants and remnants .",
    "the ( ms , ms ) merger rates in our models are comparable to the merger rates in paper ii , but ( ms , wd ) were much greater in model s of paper ii because it is older ( 10gyr ) .",
    "the ( ms , gs ) merger rate is lower because there are fractionally fewer main - sequence stars in paper ii .",
    "hurley et al . (",
    "2001 ) have modeled the open cluster m67 , using a simulation code similar in many ways to our own .",
    "both codes use fitting formulae for single star evolution , and include a series of recipes for dealing with binary star evolution . the main difference between hurley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the current paper lies in the parameter choices for their simulations : they evolved 15,000 stars to an age of 2500 myr , before adding dynamics , in the form of a direct @xmath35-body calculation .",
    "they then evolved the combined model to an age of 4300 myr , appropriate for the old open cluster m67 .",
    "they also present the results from smaller @xmath35-body runs , starting at earlier times .",
    "hurley et al . ( 2001 ) focused mostly on the formation of blue stragglers , and reported that their simulations indeed produced roughly the right number of blue stragglers , in agreement with observations of m67 .",
    "they also performed a non - dynamical binary evolution population synthesis , and found that the number of blue stragglers in that case fell short of that required by observations .",
    "they concluded that dynamical encounters have been crucial in the evolution of m67 . while it is difficult to make a quantitative comparison between their simulations and ours , given the rather different types of initial conditions , our main results concerning the numbers and types of collisions , and the formation rate of triples are in broad agreement .",
    "we have performed detailed calculations of intermediate - mass open clusters near the sun .",
    "the initial conditions were selected to mimic star clusters such as pleiades , praesepe and hyades .",
    "our calculations included the effects of dynamical encounters between stars and higher order systems , the tidal field of the parent galaxy and the evolution of single stars and binary stars .",
    "our model star clusters dissolved in the tidal field of the galaxy within about 1 billion years .",
    "the rate of mass loss remained roughly constant , at @xmath36@xmath37 per million years , corresponding to a cluster half - life of @xmath381000myr , depending on distance from the galactic center .",
    "the density profiles of the model clusters changed dramatically during the cluster lifetime .",
    "core collapse was prevented by stellar mass loss and binary heating .",
    "our less concentrated ( w4 ) models became more compact during the first few million years , whereas the more concentrated ( w6 ) models expanded from the beginning .",
    "the w4 models still dissolved more quickly in the galactic tidal field , however , mainly due to their closer proximity of the galactic center .",
    "mass segregation is a very efficient process . after only a small fraction of an initial relaxation time , single white dwarfs , giants , collision products , hard binaries , mass transferring binaries and binaries with one or two massive components ( compared to the mean mass in the cluster )",
    "were all noticeably more centrally concentrated than the average star , as measured by the half mass radii of the various components .",
    "the numbers of binaries decreased with time at roughly the same rate as the numbers of single stars , with the result that the binary fractions in our models remained more or less constant over the studied range of cluster ages .",
    "the binary fraction generally decreased during the first few million years by several percent , due to supernovae and dynamical encounters , both of which tended to disrupt binaries .",
    "for the remainder of the evolution , this fraction slowly increased .",
    "the maximum binary fraction of @xmath39 is reached near disruption .",
    "the fraction of binaries in the core remained between 50% and 60% higher than the fraction near the half - mass radius over the entire lifetime of the cluster .",
    "the widest binaries were dissociated soon after the start of the simulations . a considerable fraction ( @xmath40 ) of highly eccentric binaries with rather short orbital periods circularized and some experienced mass transfer early in the evolution of the cluster .",
    "these short - period binaries were generally more centrally concentrated than wider binaries or single stars , because they are on average more massive than single stars and do not interact .",
    "the overall distributions of binary parameters , however , hardly change with time . apart from the loss of binaries with the largest orbital periods and those with short orbital periods and high eccentricities , most binaries were relatively unaffected by either stellar evolution or stellar dynamics .",
    "the observed binary populations in open clusters may therefore be a reasonable representation of the initial primordial population .",
    "we define three families of escaping stars .",
    "( 1 ) neutron stars were ejected from the cluster with very high velocities .",
    "about 0.4% of all stars were ejected as neutron stars due to supernova explosions .",
    "( 2 ) massive stars tended to have rather high escape velocities , because they were often found in close binaries which were disrupted by the explosion of the primary star , possibly after a phase of mass transfer .",
    "the average escape velocity of all single main sequence stars in model w4 was @xmath41 , whereas stars with @xmath42 had @xmath43 . for model",
    "w6 these numbers are only slightly smaller .",
    "( 3 ) the mean escaper velocity of low - mass stars ( @xmath44 for stars with @xmath45 ) was comparable to the cluster velocity distribution ; the mean velocity of escaping binaries was ( @xmath46 for model w4 and @xmath47 for model w6 ) , somewhat smaller than that for single stars .      not surprisingly , collisions tended to occur near the cluster center , but a considerable fraction of mergers occured farther out , near the tidal radius . more than 80% of all collisions occurred within about two core radii .",
    "most ( @xmath48% ) collisions occurred between two main sequence stars .",
    "about 70% of the collisions were the result of an unstable phase of mass transfer .",
    "the rest occurred in single - star  binary or binary  binary encounters .",
    "multiple collisions were rare : only two out of 241 in our model calculations .",
    "collision participants were somewhat more massive than expected based on the simple cross section arguments presented in paper iii .",
    "most ( 85% ) collisions occurred between main - sequence stars ; most of the remainder involved a main - sequence star and a giant ( 12% ) .",
    "only 3% of the collisions occurred between two remnants .",
    "the dynamical activity in the cluster core , however , caused quite a few white dwarfs to become binary members , which would later merge due to the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "this leads to a rather high merger rate among white dwarfs ( see also shara & hurley 2002 ) .",
    "the overall supernova rate in our simulations was consistent with rates observed in the galaxy .",
    "however , the ratios of type ii to type ia , ib , and ic supernova are quite different .",
    "most striking is the order of magnitude enhancement of type ia supernovae in the w4 models compared to the non - dynamical models and the population synthesis of non - interacting binaries . in these same models ,",
    "type ib supernova are enhanced by about a factor of two compared to a population of binaries without dynamical encounters .",
    "because of the assumed neutron - star kick distribution , pulsars were generally not retained in our cluster models . only one out of 61 neutron stars",
    "was retained to form an x - ray binary later in its lifetime .",
    "the observed velocity distribution of ejected pulsars was somewhat smaller than the input kick velocity distribution .",
    "x - ray binaries in which a white dwarf accretes from a companion star were about an order of magnitude more common .",
    "x - ray binaries containing black holes were rare simply because such objects form from the highest - mass stars , which are themselves rare .    among the more unusual collisions , in our simulations",
    ", we observed one between a neutron star and a helium giant , two between co white dwarfs , resulting in type ia supernovae and the formation of an x - ray binary with a black hole as accretor .",
    "several white dwarfs experienced a phase of mass transfer from a companion star .",
    "the donor was most often a ( sub)giant . in total ,",
    "13 x - ray binaries were formed , most with a white dwarf as accretor .",
    "the number of persistent triples formed in our calculations was about an order of magnitude smaller than the observed fraction of triples in open clusters and the galactic disk , although the frequency of triples and higher - order systems present at any moment in our simulations was comparable to the numbers actually observed .",
    "the majority of these were transient , however , and their orbital parameters differed considerably from observations .",
    "the orbital parameters of the outer orbits of the formed triples formed in our models was not representative of triples observed in the galaxy , which tend to have shorter periods and lower eccentricities .",
