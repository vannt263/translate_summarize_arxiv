    "the anderson - hubbard model ( ahm ) is the simplest model that describes strongly - correlated electrons in a disordered lattice .",
    "the ahm is widely used , for example , to describe doped transition metal oxides , where the electronic properties are affected by both a strong local coulomb repulsion and doping - related disorder.@xcite the ahm is also relevant to cold atomic gases in random optical lattices,@xcite and there has been recent interest in the ahm as a model interacting system that exhibits anderson localization.@xcite the physics of the ahm is determined by dimensionality , by filling , and by the three energy scales : the kinetic energy @xmath0 , the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath1 , and the disorder strength @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath3 , this model reduces to the well - known hubbard model which , despite its simplicity , has only been solved exactly in the limits of one@xcite and infinite dimensions@xcite .    in the hubbard model",
    ", the interesting physics arises from a competition between @xmath0 , which tends to delocalize electrons , and @xmath1 , which tends to localize electrons .",
    "when the lattice is half filled ( i.e.  when there is one electron per site ) , a sufficiently large @xmath1 can generate a mott insulating phase .",
    "the mott transition occurs at a critical @xmath4 that depends on the details of the lattice .",
    "much of the hubbard model research in the past few decades has revolved around strong correlation effects slightly away from the mott insulating phase , which is achieved either by taking @xmath1 less than @xmath4 or by doping away from half filling .",
    "one of the important ideas to come out of the hubbard model is that the low energy physics of the strongly correlated metal phase near the mott transition is governed by an effective interaction @xmath5.@xcite    contrary to this , recent exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo studies of the two - dimensional anderson - hubbard model have found that a zero bias anomaly ( zba ) of width @xmath0 forms in the density of states ( dos).@xcite the zba appears as a v - shaped dip in the dos at the fermi energy @xmath6 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "while it is not surprising that disorder might introduce another low energy scale other than @xmath7 , it is surprising that this new scale is independent of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the observed zba is not explained by the conventional altshuler - aronov theory of weakly correlated metals . in altshuler - aronov theory ,",

    "the physics of this zba is subtle , and is not captured by most approximations .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation@xcite yields a v - shaped zero bias anomaly when magnetic moments are allowed to form,@xcite and has a low - energy soft gap that is apparently associated with a multi - valley energy landscape.@xcite however , the width of the zba grows with @xmath1 , suggesting that the physics of the zba is different than that found by exact diagonalization .",
    "furthermore , the evidence for a soft gap in exact diagonalization calculations is less well established,@xcite and it is possible that quantum fluctuations fill in the soft gap .",
    "another common approximation , dynamical mean field theory ( dmft),@xcite includes strong correlation physics , but has not found a zba at all .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that this is because of nonlocal contributions to the self - energy neglected in these calculations .",
    "recent analytical studies of the two site ahm _ do _ find a zba with qualitative features that are consistent with exact diagonalization .",
    "these calculations interpret the zba in terms of level repulsion between many - body eigenstates,@xcite and demonstrate how strong correlations can generate a kinetic energy driven zba .",
    "while these studies are instructive , it is difficult to connect them to the more usual language of many - body self - energies in interacting systems .    in this article",

    "[ sec : iii ] .",
    "before we proceed with the calculations , we emphasize a significant difference between weakly and strongly correlated systems that affects our analysis . in the atomic limit , obtained by setting @xmath13 ,",
    "the dos is a sum of the local spectrum at each atomic site . for noninteracting systems",
    ", each local spectrum has a single resonance at the orbital energy @xmath14 of that site .",
    "however , for strongly correlated systems , there are two resonances , at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which we term the lower hubbard orbital ( lho ) and upper hubbard orbital ( uho ) respectively .",
    "these energies correspond to transitions in which an electron is added to a site that is initially empty ( lho ) or singly occupied ( uho ) .",
    "the lho and uho are precursors of the lower and upper hubbard bands that form when @xmath0 is nonzero .",
    "the calculations in this work are based on an expansion around the atomic limit and are appropriate for the strong disorder case . by strong disorder , we mean @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the coordination number of the lattice and @xmath18 is of the order of the average level spacing of the @xmath17 sites adjacent to any site in the lattice , and the factor of 2 is because there is an lho and a uho at each site . in this limit ,",
    "the local spectrum at a particular lattice site is dominated by @xmath19 resonances associated with the site and its @xmath17 nearest neighbors.@xcite      in this section , we develop a framework that explicitly shows the role of local and nonlocal correlations in the dos .",
    "we then use this framework to analyze the results of numerical exact diagonalization calculations for the ahm .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the exact diagonalization calculations .",

    "second , we have used this expression to analyze exact diagonalization results , and have shown that the zba is the result of nonlocal correlations , rather than the local self - energy .      in the previous section , we established that the zba can be related to the derivative of @xmath87 with respect to the site energy @xmath14 . in this section ,",
    "we analyse the structure of @xmath87 in more detail in order to see the role of spin and charge fluctuations in forming the zba .",
    "we begin by writing @xmath44 in terms of an alternative exact expression@xcite that is more transparent than the original definition [ eq .  ( [ eq : gloc ] ) ] : @xmath107 g_{jk}^{{{i\\kern-0.3em/}}}(\\omega)[t_{ki}+\\sigma_{ki}(\\omega ) ] , \\label{eq : lambda}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 is a green s function matrix element for the lattice with site @xmath22 removed.@xcite this equation shows explicitly how the matrix elements @xmath109 couple the site @xmath22 to the rest of the lattice . in general , @xmath108 is not trivial to calculate , and this expression is of use only when @xmath110 can be simplified through some approximation or limit . here",

    "we note that , while @xmath44 is real for a single disorder configuration on a finite lattice , the disorder - averaged hybridization function @xmath114 is complex .",
    "the real part of @xmath87 describes shifts of the lho and uho energies while the imaginary part describes the broadening of these orbitals due to the lattice . for the analysis in this work to make sense",
    ", the broadening must be much less than the level spacing ( @xmath115 ) of the local spectrum , so that discrete energy levels at each site keep their distinct identity .",
    "we can estimate the broadening from a simplified disorder average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda1 ] ) . setting @xmath116",
    ", we obtain @xmath117 where the sum over @xmath23 is replaced by the factor @xmath17 , and @xmath118 is the disorder average over site @xmath23 .",

    "the condition that this is much less than the level spacing of the local spectrum can be written @xmath122 , which is met provided our initial assumption @xmath123 is met .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lambda1 ] ) shows that the nonlocal self - energy is central to the zba . to proceed further , we need an analytic form for this self - energy , and we adopt a partial fractions expansion for the self - energy that is based on the equation - of - motion method.@xcite the rationale for this choice is that the equation - of - motion method correctly reproduces the lho and uho in the atomic limit , and has been shown to be accurate for the two - site ahm.@xcite in general , we expect this method to work well when short - range physics dominates .",

    "this is because the local coulomb interaction tends to fix the charge density at each site , so that the spin and charge correlations are only weak functions of @xmath27 .",
