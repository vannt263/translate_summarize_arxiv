    "is completely absorbed in the dla trough , it has been proposed that the ly@xmath4 emission from star formation in dla host galaxy can be observed with an assistant from the natural coronagraph .",
    "however , most of searches for the residual ly@xmath4 emission in broad dla trough of quasar spectra resulted in non  detections ( e.g. smith et al . 1989 ; kulkarni et al . 2006 ; cai et al .",
    "individual detections were sparsely reported , e.g. in the super  dla with @xmath11  @xmath12 toward q1135@xmath130010 ( noterdaeme et al .",

    "2012 ) , in the strong dla with @xmath14  @xmath12 toward pks  0458@xmath1302 ( mller et al . 2004 ) , and in the metal - rich dla towards q2222 - 0946 ( fynbo et al .",
    "recently , noterdaeme et al . (",
    "2014 ) studied a large sample of extremely strong dlas ( esdla ; @xmath15 @xmath12 ) observed in boss of sdss  iii and found significant residual ly@xmath4 emission in the composite esdla spectrum .",
    "the esdlas are plausibly associated with galaxies having high star formation rates .",
    "ly@xmath4 `` blobs '' have been discovered occasionally at close redshifts to quasars with tiny impact parameters of @xmath16  5  ( weidinger et al .",
    "2005 ; zafar et al.2011 ) .",
    "these ly@xmath4 photons are most probably radiated from ambient gas illuminated by their associated quasars ( weidinger et al .",
    "2004 ) . on the other hand , dlas in proximity to quasars with @xmath17 ( pdlas ; prochaska et al .",
    "2008 ) appear to preferentially exhibit residual ly@xmath4 emissions in their absorption troughs ( e.g. mller & warren 1993 ; mller et al .",

    "similar to ly@xmath4 `` blobs '' , fluorescent recombination radiation from ambient gas photoionized by the quasar , rather than star formation activity in quasar host galaxy , is likely the main contributor to the residual ly@xmath4 emission found in pdlas .",
    "this is the case for the strong ly@xmath4 emission ( @xmath18  erg  s@xmath3 ) superposed on the trough of the pdla toward the quasar sdss j124020.91@xmath0145535.6 ( hereafter j1240@xmath01455 ; @xmath19 ; hennawi et al .",

    "in the course of a survey for the quasar intermediate  width emission lines ( iels ; li et al .",
    "2015 ) in sdss dr12 , we found a high  confidence candidate of ly@xmath4 iel in the spectrum of the quasar sdss j095253.83@xmath0011422.0 ( hereafter j0952@xmath00114 ) at @xmath20 .",
    "the observed ly@xmath4 line is extremely narrow ( fwhm@xmath51000 km s@xmath3 ) in comparison with the broad metal emission lines ( fwhm@xmath59000 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the absence of broad ly@xmath4 emission line in j0952@xmath00114 was first reported by hall et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using the sdss ",
    "i / ii spectrum .",
    "the authors suggested that the broad line region might be dominated by very dense gas ( 10@xmath21  @xmath22 ) in which broad ly@xmath4 emission is suppressed , but unusual ionization parameters and peculiar configuration of emitting clouds are required to reproduce the emission line spectrum .",
    "an alternative explanation that the broad ly@xmath4 emission is removed by smooth absorption arising from nv  and ly@xmath4 , was discussed as well , but regarded as unlikely there ( hall et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the boss spectra of j0952@xmath00114 , covering a wider wavelength range than sdss spectrum , provide new insight into this exotic quasar .",
    "the damped ly@xmath7 absorption , the high  order lyman  series absorptions , and the lyman limit absorption edge at @xmath23  @xmath24 are firmly detected at the blue end of its two boss spectra .",
    "these detections demonstrate that a high column density pdla intercepts the sightline to the quasar .",
    "the damped ly@xmath4 absorption trough removes the intrinsic broad ly@xmath4 emission of the quasar completely .",
    "the observed narrow ly@xmath4 emission line should arise from the ambient gas in an extended area , which is larger than the cross  section of the pdla cloud .",
    "the geometry of this system ( i.e. the background quasar , the pdla cloud and the emitting gas ) is similar to that of the system seen toward the quasar j1240@xmath01455 ( hennawi et al .",
    "however , the luminosity of residual ly@xmath4 emission observed in j0952@xmath00114 is much larger than that in sdss j1240@xmath01455 by nearly two orders of magnitude , plausibly indicating that they have different origins .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we summarise the observations ; detailed analysis of the absorption and emission spectrum are presented in  3 ; in  4 , we discuss the origin of the luminous ly@xmath4 emission in j0952@xmath00114 as well as applications and implications ; a summary is then made in  5 . throughout this paper , @xmath25 is taken to be 70.3 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "j0952@xmath00114 is a quasar at @xmath20 identified by sdss .",
    "two spectra were first acquired with the sdss spectrograph ( york et al .",

    "the spectra spread a wavelength range of @xmath283,8009,200   .",
    "two additional spectra were taken using the boss spectrograph ( dawson et al .",
    "2013 ) , which are fed with 2  fibers and provide a more extended wavelength coverage of @xmath283,60010,400   , on 2010 december 09 and 2011 march 25 .",
    "all spectra share a similar spectral resolution of @xmath292,000 .",
    "we carefully compared the sdss spectra with the boss spectra in continuum , emission lines and absorption lines .",
    "no significant variation in either of these spectral features spanning @xmath5 2 years in quasar s rest - frame is detected .",
    "figure 1 presents the combined boss spectrum of j0952@xmath00114 .",
    "the ly@xmath4 emission line is significantly narrower than the broad metal emission lines ( see inserted panel in figure 1 ) .",
    "moreover , an associated civ  absorption system with plenty of absorption lines is identified at z@xmath303.010 .",
    "the boss spectrum of j0952@xmath00114 ranges from 895    to 2550    in quasar s rest - frame .",
    "it enables us to search for the neutral hydrogen lyman ",
    "series absorptions corresponding to the associated civ  absorber ( figure 2a ) .",
    "firstly , the damped absorption trough of ly@xmath7 is credibly identified , which is much broader than any other obvious absorption features ( possibly intervening ly@xmath4 absorption lines ) blanketing the spectrum at @xmath31  1216     .",
    "the lyman ",
    "series absorptions in higher orders , from ly@xmath32 to even ly9 , can be identified despite contamination from the ly@xmath4 forest . in the very blue end of the spectrum ,",
    "the flux at rest wavelengths @xmath31  912    is deeply suppressed , suggesting an optically thick neutral hydrogen cloud at the lyman limit .",
    "all the facts , especially the presence of the damped ly@xmath7 absorption , reveal that the associated absorber has a high column density of neutral hydrogen .    in order to normalize the observed spectrum , we model the unabsorbed spectrum of j0952@xmath00114 with the composite @xmath33 quasar spectrum ( zheng et al .",
    "1997 ) as an initial guess .",
    "the quasar continua fit well with each other , but the observed emission line of ly@xmath34o is stronger than that in the composite spectrum ( figure 2a ) . in the composite @xmath33 spectrum , the continuum in ultraviolet ( uv ) can be modelled as a broken power law , with the spectral index of @xmath35 at 350    @xmath36 1050     ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 at 1050  @xmath36 2200    is ( zheng et al .",
    "we model the uv continuum of j0952@xmath00114 using the same broken power law and model the ly@xmath34o emission line with one broad gaussian .",
    "the full model of the unabsorbed spectrum is presented in figure 2a and is applied for normalization .",
    "we measure the column density of neutral hydrogen using voigt profile fitting to the ly@xmath7 trough ( figure 2b ) .",
    "fit model well reproduces the damped wings of ly@xmath7 , while there is very weak residual flux in the line center .",
    "we infer that the residual flux is the ly@xmath7 emission associated with the strong ly@xmath4 emission of interest .",
    "the voigt profile fitting results in a column density of @xmath39 . considering the systematic error due to uncertainty of normalization",
    ", we conservatively increase the error by 0.1 dex and adopt @xmath40 .",
    "we have demonstrated that the associated absorber toward j0952@xmath00114 is a very strong pdla .",
    "any ly@xmath4 emission from the regions covered by the pdla cloud in the line of sight should be blocked completely .",
    "the observed ly@xmath4 emission in j0952@xmath00114 necessarily arises from extended regions around the quasar nucleus ( or in the host galaxy ) , which is beyond the coverage of the pdla cloud .",
    "jenkins ( 1990 ) proposed a technique to deduce the velocity dispersion of absorbers from the convergence of the lyman ",
    "series lines at wavelengths just above the lyman limit .",
    "the lyman line convergence technique is very useful for low  resolution spectra ( hurwitz & bowyer 1995 ) .",
    "however , the lyman edge can not be confidently identified in the spectrum of j0952@xmath00114 , owing to heavy contamination from ly@xmath4 forest absorptions and the relatively low signal  to  noise ratio of data at this spectral region .",
    "instead , we estimate the doppler parameter @xmath41 by fitting the depths of high  order lyman  series lines . having such a high neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath42",
    ", the lyman  series absorption lines , in orders up to ly9 , should be saturated .",
    "the non  zero fluxes observed at positions of the line centers ( figure 2c ) indicate that the lines are not resolved .",
    "if the instrumental resolution is given , we can express the line depths as functions of @xmath41 solely .",
    "adopting the derived @xmath43 and the spectral dispersion function provided along with boss spectra , we vary @xmath41 to fit the observed depths of lyman  series absorption lines .",
    "a best  fit model with @xmath44  km  s@xmath3 is derived , and a minimum width of @xmath45  km  s@xmath3 is found for the models having zero fluxes at the centers of lyman series up to ly9 , which appears to disagree with the observation . since the high  order lyman ",
    "series lines are contaminated by ly@xmath4 absorption forest seriously , it is difficult to gauge the uncertainty of @xmath41 . in a conservative manner , the fairly loose upper limit of @xmath46  km  s@xmath3",
    "is adopted in the following analysis .",
    "the ciii ]  and  civ  lines are the strongest broad emission lines in the boss spectrum of j0952@xmath00114 ( figure 3a ) .",
    "the narrow civ  and  ciii ]  emission lines are strong , if compared with the composite @xmath33 quasar spectrum .",
    "the line profiles of civ  and  ciii ]  are obtained by subtracting a power  law continuum from the observed spectrum , presented in velocity space in figure 3b and 3c , respectively .",
    "we fit the line profile of ciii ]  with four gaussians ( figure 3b ) .",
    "three gaussians are used to model the complex profile of the broad component and the other one for the narrow component .",
    "the narrow ciii ]  emission line is so prominent that it is fairly well constrained , yielding fwhm@xmath47  km  s@xmath3 . since the associated civ  absorption lines are extremely narrow , the line profile of civ  emission is mostly preserved .",
    "we directly mask the absorptions tough and fit the remaining profile using four gaussians as well ( figure 3c ) . a strong narrow civ  emission line , with fwhm@xmath48  km  s@xmath3 , is firmly detected . in a brief summary , both of the ciii ]  and",
    "civ  emission lines of j0952@xmath00114 are decomposed into a complex broad component arising from the broad emission line region ( belr ) and a narrow gaussian component arising from the narrow emission line region ( nelr ) .",
    "furthermore , the coverage of the pdla to nelr , the outermost region of the quasar j0952@xmath00114 s nucleus , is investigated , by analysing the line ratios of the isolated civ  absorptions in different cases . assuming the absorber fully covers the nucleus",
    ", we divide the observed spectrum by the full model of quasar emission in civ  region to normalize the civ  absorption lines .",
    "the normalized spectrum is presented in figure 4a . the rest ",
    "frame equivalent widths ( ews ) are ew(civ@xmath491548)@xmath50  and ew(civ@xmath491550)@xmath51 , respectively . if the absorber does not cover the nelr , the narrow civ  emission line should be subtracted before normalization .",
    "this yields ew(civ@xmath491548)@xmath52  and ew(civ@xmath491550)@xmath53   ( figure 4b )",
    ". the oscillator strength of civ@xmath491548 is twice as large as that of civ@xmath491550 , thus their equivalent width ratio should range from 2 ( both of the absorption lines are in linear part of curve of growth ) to nearly 1 ( doublets are seriously saturated ) . in theory , the line ratio of civ@xmath491548 and civ@xmath491550 must be no less than one .",
    "the second scenario , providing an unpractical line ratio , is therefore ruled out .",
    "the analysis indicates that the quasar nucleus of j0952@xmath00114 is fully covered by the associated absorber ( i.e. the pdla ) .      in our scenario ,",
    "the spectrum of j0952@xmath00114  in the ly@xmath4 band is the sum of the absorbed quasar emission , by the pdla , and the residual ly@xmath4 emission superposed on the absorption trough .",
    "the column density @xmath43 of the pdla has been obtained by fitting the associated ly@xmath7 damped trough . to model the absorbed quasar emission",
    ", we have to reconstruct the intrinsic quasar emission , which consists of a continuum , and intrinsic ly@xmath4 and nv  emission lines .",
    "the quasar continuum can be well modelled by a power law in a wide wavelength range ( figure 5a ) .",
    "however , the flux on both sides of the ly@xmath4 emission is significantly lower than the model continuum .",
    "the suppressed flux can be naturally explained as the damped wings of the associated ly@xmath4 absorption . assuming the intrinsic ly@xmath4 and nv  emission lines share the line profile of civ  emission , we utilize the best ",
    "fit profile of civ  line to model them .",
    "the intrinsic quasar emission is then absorbed by the pdla with a fixed column density of @xmath54 .",
    "we adjust the strengths of the model emission lines to fit the partially observed damped wings of pdla .",
    "the residual ly@xmath4 emission is finally derived by subtracting the best ",
    "fit model of the absorbed quasar spectrum from the observed spectrum ( figure 5b ) .",
    "the blue wing of residual ly@xmath4 emission is destroyed by the ly@xmath4 forest absorptions . in order to repair its profile , we model the ly@xmath4 emission with two gaussians by requiring the model to fit the red wing and predict a blue wing to match the imperfect envelope .",
    "the width of the repaired ly@xmath4 line is fwhm@xmath55 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the total flux of the residual ly@xmath4 emission is @xmath56  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath12 , yielding a luminosity of @xmath57  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "directly integrated residual line flux is also calculated , which is @xmath58  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath12 , and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath59  erg  s@xmath3 .      the associated absorber at @xmath6 imprints plenty of metal absorption lines in the spectrum of j0952@xmath00114 .",
    "the absorption lines in the featureless continuum are normalized straightforwardly : dividing the observed spectrum by a power law fitted to the local continuum . for the absorption lines",
    "superposed on emission lines , we first fit the emission profiles with one to four gaussians and then divide the observed spectrum by the best ",
    "fit model .",
    "znii@xmath602026,2062 absorption lines are detected in the boss spectrum .",
    "however , these two absorption lines are possibly blended with mgi@xmath492026 and crii@xmath492062 lines , respectively . a search for the stronger crii@xmath492056 line associated with the crii@xmath492062  results in a non - detection , suggesting that znii@xmath492062 absorption is almost isolated",
    ". therefore , the detections of znii@xmath492062 line and the corresponding stronger znii@xmath492026 line are solid . high  ionized absorption lines and lines from excited fine - structure levels are useful diagnostics for the physical parameters of quasar absorbers ( ellison et al .",

    "the isolated absorption line of siii@xmath61@xmath491309 looks strong but its profile is too much broader than that of other metal lines . we conclude that all the detections of siii@xmath61  transitions are false positives",

    "we illustrate several absorption lines in figure 6 .",
    "ews of the absorption lines are measured by integrating the normalized spectrum over a velocity range of [ -400,400 ]  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 . in ",
    "3.1 , we have obtained the upper limit of the doppler parameter ( i.e. @xmath46 km  s@xmath3 ) . in figure 7 , we present four curves of growth ( cog ; jenkins 1986 ) with doppler parameters of @xmath45 km  s@xmath3 , @xmath44 km  s@xmath3 , @xmath66 km  s@xmath3 and @xmath67 km  s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we can see that the shape of cog changes dramatically with @xmath41 .",

    "a reliable column densities measurement using the metal absorption lines detected in j0952@xmath00114 is therefore unable to be achieved , given that the doppler parameter can not be determined in advance ( prochaska 2006 ) .",

    "in j0952@xmath00114 , the requirement of proximity to a hard ionizing source for the presence of nv  transitions , which are rarely seen in intervening dlas , constrains the distance between the quasar and absorber of @xmath69 mpc ( fox et al .",

    "2015 ) reported an intrinsic dla toward the quasar sdss j082303.22@xmath0052907.6 .",
    "the distance of the absorbing cloud to the quasar nucleus is @xmath69 kpc , and extended ly@xmath4 emission was observed with the assistance from the coronagraphic cloud .",
    "however , the origin of the pdla toward j0952@xmath00114  can be hardly determined in this way , as the siii@xmath61 transitions are not detected in the spectrum .",
    "the coverage analysis of the civ  absorption lines has revealed that the pdla cloud is in a scale larger than the nelr of j0952@xmath00114 .",
    "if the pdla absorber is the inter  stellar medium ( ism ) in the quasar host galaxy or in a foreground galaxy , its volume density might be similar to regular dlas , in a range of @xmath711100  @xmath22 ( prochaska & hennawi 2009 ) . assuming a homogeneous density in the cloud , we estimate its length scale as @xmath7220  pc2  kpc .",
    "it is consistent with , more extended in a way , the scales of nelr observed in the local active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. kraemer et al .",
    "1994 ; hutchings et al . 1998 ; peterson et al .",
    "if the pdla cloud has a higher density , it would be necessarily closer to the quasar nucleus , more likely in the quasar host galaxy , to keep a relatively high ionization parameter @xmath73 to produce nv  absorption lines .",

    "the pdla of interest is unlikely to have such a high density , or the corresponding size will be too small to cover the quasar nelr in that case .",
    "the quasar j0952@xmath00114  was initially selected as an iel quasar candidate . however , the ly@xmath4 iel scenario has to be ruled out . as the nelr , i.e. the outermost region of quasar nucleus , is already covered by the pdla cloud , the iel region that presumably exists between the belr and nelr ( e.g. brotherton et al .",
    "1994 ) , must be blocked in the ly@xmath4 band .",
    "outflows over nelr scales have been observed widely , traced by the optical emission lines of their photoionized gas , in nearby agns ( e.g. fu & stockton 2009 ; liu et al .",
    "2013 ; harrison et al .",
    "the emission lines arising from those outflows generally have velocity widths of @xmath5800 km s@xmath3 , which are above the escape velocities from the host galaxies . having a similar line width",
    ", the ly@xmath4 emission of j0952@xmath00114  is very likely the fluorescent recombination radiation from outflows driven by quasar .",
    "we derive a covering factor of the emitting gas as @xmath75 , where the ionizing photon rate @xmath76 s@xmath3 is estimated by scaling the observed spectrum with the mf87 sed ( spectral energy distribution ; mathews & ferland 1987 ) and the case b recombination is assumed . this is over an order of magnitude larger than that of the ly@xmath4 blobs observed around quasars ( @xmath770.5% ; e.g. heckman et al .",
    "1991 ; christensen et al .",
    "the large covering factor also supports the outflow scenario rather than quiescent ism or infalling gas in / onto the quasar host galaxy ( rees 1988 ; haiman & rees 2001 ; hennawi et al.2009 ) .",
    "the spatial extent of outflows is critical to the evaluation of whether a quasar is able to input its energy effectively into ism of its host galaxy . only galaxy  scale outflows are efficient quasar feedbacks , which can quench the star formation widely in quasar hosts and therefore regulate evolution of galaxies ( e.g. silk & rees 1998 ; di matteo et al . 2005 ) . meanwhile , the discoveries of a significant population of massive evolved galaxies at @xmath78 ( e.g. mccarthy et al .",
    "2004 ; saracco et al .",
    "2005 ) , require that the quasar feedback must have impinged in the early universe .",
    "observations of galaxy  scale outflows are desired to study the quasar feedback at high redshifts .",
    "however , it is challenging to identify the extended outflows from the  seeing fuzz \" of bright quasars even if they are large enough to be spatially resolved .",
    "currently , most of high  redshift galaxy  scale outflows serving as evidences for quasar feedback in the early universe are actually observed in radio galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. nesvadba et al .",
    "2008 ; alexander et al . 2010 ; harrison et al .",
    "2012 ) , where the central agns are obscured and/or intrinsically dim . with the assistance of a pdla blocking the emission at ly@xmath4 wavelengths from the background quasars , the galaxy  scale outflows emitting substantial ly@xmath4 photons can be easily resolved , using narrow  band imaging and long  slit / integral field spectroscopy , for high  redshift quasars in bright phase .",
    "the successful application of this technique in resolving the weak ly@xmath4 `` blob '' detected in the pdla tough of the quasar q0151 + 048 ( zafar et al .",
    "2011 ) gives us further confidence in revealing outflows in j0952@xmath00114  analogues .",
    "we then carefully re  examine the sdss spectra with 3  fiber and the boss spectra with 2  fiber , of j0952@xmath00114 , to seek for the possible increment of ly@xmath4 flux observed in a larger aperture .",
    "there is no significant variation in the ly@xmath4 line , suggesting that the ly@xmath4 emission must be concentrated in 2  on sky , i.e. a proper size of @xmath79  kpc at @xmath20 . in j0952@xmath00114 ,",
    "the luminous ly@xmath4 emission contributes @xmath58% of the total flux in sdss @xmath80 band . in figure 8",
    ", we subtract its sdss image by the point spread function ( psf ) model derived from the nearby stars in the field , which can be fitted using a 2d gaussian with fwhm@xmath81 .",
    "no significant residual flux is detected , and therefore the luminous ly@xmath4 emission of interest is not spatially resolved in the sdss image .",
    "the approach of using dlas as a natural coronagraph to observe the ly@xmath4 emission associated with star formation in their host galaxies has been studied extensively ( e.g. kulkarni et al .",

    "2007 ) are @xmath82  yr@xmath3 , while the sfr in quasar host galaxies is @xmath83  yr@xmath3 ( e.g. ho 2005 ; cai et al .",
    "2014 ) . using the kennicutt ( 1998 ) calibration @xmath84 erg s@xmath3 and assuming an intensity ratio of @xmath85 for the case b recombination",
    ", we estimate a ly@xmath4 luminosity of @xmath86  erg  s@xmath3 for the strong star formation activities .",
    "this is much lower than the luminosity of the residual ly@xmath4 emission observed in j0952@xmath00114 .",
    "conclusively , the residual ly@xmath4 emission associated with star formation is fairly weak , in comparison with quasar emission , and thus the dla troughs can be seen clearly in this case .",
    "the identification of dla trough becomes difficult , if the residual ly@xmath4 flux is large enough to fill it almost entirely .",
    "it is notable that j0952@xmath00114  was omitted in all the spectroscopic surveys of dlas and pdlas in sdss ( e.g. prochaska et al . 2008 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2012b ; finley et al .",
    "more proper criteria for selecting j0952@xmath00114  analogies would be : quasars having significantly narrower ly@xmath4 emissions than their broad civ  lines , jointly with associated damped absorptions from ly@xmath7 ( if its absorption trough is preserved ) or associated strong metal absorption lines .",
    "our preliminary survey shows that such systems are not very rare in sdss quasars .",

    "we revisit the unusual ly@xmath4 emission of j0952@xmath00114  ( hall et al .",
    "2004 ) , motivated initially by searching for the quasar iels ( li et al .",
    "a high column density ( @xmath40 ) neutral hydrogen cloud in proximity to the quasar is identified via the detections of an associated damped ly@xmath7 absorption trough , high  order lyman ",
    "series absorptions , and the lyman limit absorption edge in the boss spectrum of j0952@xmath00114 .",
    "meanwhile , the line ratio of the associated civ  absorptions suggests that both of belr and nelr of the quasar are covered by the thick cloud .",
    "these new clues merge into a scenario that the absence of broad ly@xmath4 line is due to strong pdla absorption and the residual ly@xmath4 emission superposed on the trough is fluorescent recombination radiation from ambient gas outside of nelr . with a luminosity of @xmath10  erg  s@xmath3 ,",
    "the residual ly@xmath4 emission is the largest ever seen in either intervening or proximate dla troughs .",
    "the coverage analysis firstly rules out an iel origin of the observed ly@xmath4 emission .",
    "its relatively broad line width and high luminosity largely exclude the possibility that it is associated with star formation activities , but suggest an origin from outflows driven by quasar .",
    "the proper size of the outflow , inferred from sdss spectra and images , is @xmath79  kpc .",
    "pdlas , acting like natural coronagraphs , provides us with a good probe into the illuminated gas in the vicinity of quasars , which is hardly resolved due to its small size or  seeing fuzz \" of bright quasars .",
    "it is worthwhile to search for analogies of j0952@xmath00114  in large sky area spectroscopic surveys , such as sdss and lamost ( zhao et al .",
