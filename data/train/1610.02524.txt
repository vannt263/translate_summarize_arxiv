    "single photons with orbital angular momentum ( oam ) have been prospective high dimensional resources in quantum physics since 1992 @xcite .",
    "the hilbert space dimension of a single photon with oam can , in principle , be arbitrarily large .",
    "this high - dimensional property gives oam an important role in fundamental studies of quantum mechanics @xcite , high precision optical metrology , micromechanics @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite , quantum memory @xcite , quantum computing @xcite and high - dimensional quantum communication @xcite .",
    "in many fields , sorting different oam states is a fundamental requirement , such as the measurement of high - dimensional bell states @xcite and quantum communication . in the early days , a fork hologram was a primary tool for sorter single photons with different oam values @xcite .",
    "the fork hologram adds a spire phase structure to the incident oam light .",
    "if the added azimuthal phase structure is @xmath0 , then the incident oam light with quantum number @xmath1 will be transformed into a zero - order gaussian light , whereas light with @xmath2 will be transformed into non - zero oam light .",
    "thus , a single mode fiber after the hologram will collect only the oam light with quantum number @xmath1 .",
    "however , this method can only measure light with one particular oam state each time @xcite .",
    "the improved sorter with a fork hologram can sort several oam states but with very low efficiency @xcite .",
    "recently , berkhout _ et al .",
    "_ introduced conformal transformation into oam sorter studies @xcite .",
    "they employed a cartesian to log - polar transformation to sort different oam states simultaneously . by combining the cartesian to log - polar transformation with refractive beam copying ,",
    "the number of oam states being sorted simultaneously can reach 25 to 27 , and the sorter efficiency is greater than @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "although very successful , sorters with conformal transformation destroy the incident photon states .",
    "the oam mode can be retrieved from the gaussian mode by introducing a desired azimuthal phase , but the external phase added can not be retrieved as it is usually not prior known in many applications , e.g. , in quantum cryptography .",
    "this disadvantage limits further applications of oam states in quantum processing .",
    "leach _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated a non - destructive sorter method utilizing a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) with two dove prisms @xcite .",
    "this method can in principle sort different oam states with @xmath4 efficiency . the method has been further developed to demonstrate non - destructive sorters for spin - oam states @xcite .",
    "because the mzi is two dimensional , this type of sorter can only sort oam states with odd @xmath1 from states with even @xmath1 .",
    "thus , a cascading stage structure with @xmath5 mzis is needed to sort @xmath6 oam states .",
    "the cascading stage structure also calls for different changes of azimuthal phases , corresponding to the quantum numbers @xmath1 of oam states , and rotating angles in different stages .",
    "as oam states with different values of @xmath1 evolve with different gouy phases @xcite , the changing of the azimuthal phase in the different stages decreases the visibility of the mzis .",
    "these disadvantages limit its applications .    in this work , we propose a high - dimensional sorter that sorts different oam states simultaneously",
    ". this sorter is constructed by symmetric @xmath7-port beamsplitters ( bss ) and dove prisms .",
    "the symmetric @xmath7-port bss are used to realize @xmath6-dimensional unitary transformations ( uts ) .",
    "the dove prisms modulate the phases of different oam states according to the quantum numbers @xmath1 .",
    "since there is no state collapse or active control process , the sorter does not destroy the input oam states and will not limit the operation rate of the system .",
    "we propose three types of cascading - structure oam sorters , which greatly reduce the resources required and solve the problem of extending the oam sorter to higher dimensions .",
    "before discussing the oam sorter , we first introduce the @xmath7-port bs . fig . [",
    "fig : bs](a ) gives the structure of the elementary 2-dimensional bs ( the 4-port bs with two input and two output ports ) .",
    "it can be described by a @xmath8 ut : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the reflectivity and transmissivity of the interface , respectively .",
    "the negative of the last matrix element is introduced by the reflection off the higher index medium .",
    "it becomes the most common symmetric 50:50 bs when @xmath12 .",
    "generally , bss with more input and output ports are called multiport bss @xcite .",
    "we consider only symmetric multiport bss here .",
    "a photon incident from input port @xmath13 of a symmetric @xmath7-port bs will output from all output ports with equal amplitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bs](b ) ) .",
    "a symmetric @xmath7-port bs is described by an @xmath14 ut . for @xmath15 , the ut for any symmetric multiport bs is unique based on the conservation of energy .",
    "this class of ut is called the canonical multiport @xcite . for @xmath16 , there are an infinite number of equivalent classes of uts for a @xmath7-port bs @xcite .",
    "our work is confined to the canonical multiport bs .",
    "the @xmath14 ut of a canonical @xmath7-port bs is @xmath17 for a single photon incident from port-@xmath13 , the output state will become @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the photon incident ( output ) from port-@xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 goes to a second cascading @xmath7-port bs , the final output state will become @xmath22 the subscript @xmath23 represents the first ( second ) @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath25 is output from only a single port , as the second @xmath7-port bs can be seen as the inverse of the optical path of the first @xmath7-port bs .",
    "thus , a single photon incident from a different port of the first @xmath7-port bs will output from a different port of the second .",
    "this phenomenon is the inspiration of our oam sorter .",
    "now , we detail the oam sorter .",
    "[ eq : psi1 ] shows that the first @xmath7-port bs acts not only as an equal probability amplitude distributor but also as a phase modulator ( pm ) .",
    "the phase introduced depends on the initial incident port . if we add a different phase on a different path , @xmath26 in path-@xmath27 , between the first and second @xmath7-port bs ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oamsorter](a ) ) , then @xmath28 , and @xmath29 where the integer parameter @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the output port is controlled by parameter @xmath1 .",
    "what if the incident photon has oam and the pms are dove prisms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oamsorter](b ) ) ?",
    "when the dove prism rotates by an angle @xmath31 along the propagation axis , the phase shift of an @xmath1-order oam photon becomes @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "if the rotation angles of dove prisms of different paths are in the form @xmath33 , for an incident @xmath1-order oam photon from port-@xmath13 of the first @xmath24 , the final output port of the second @xmath24 is determined by eq .",
    "[ eq : psi2oam ] , provided that the transformation of the @xmath7-port bs remains @xmath24 .",
    "then , two @xmath7-port bss and @xmath6 dove prisms comprise the non - destructive oam sorter .",
    "additionally , the sorter requires no active modulation of the dove prism .",
    "thus , there is no limit to the sorter speed . in order to preserve spin angular momentum ( sam ) , we adopt the improved dove prism module in ref .",
    "@xcite , which consists of an improved dove prism and a half - wave plate ( hwp ) , instead of the primary one . for simplicity ,",
    "the initial oam states are considered by convention to input from port-@xmath34 of the first multiport bs of the oam sorter if no statement is claimed .",
    "unfortunately , the classical multiport bss are constructed from two - dimensional bss , mirrors and pms @xcite .",
    "the bs is not oam preserving because the reflection on the bs or mirror will invert the @xmath1-order oam state @xmath35 to @xmath36 , where the subscript @xmath37 represents the oam state .",
    "there is no interference for two identical oam states incident from different ports of the bs @xcite .",
    "thus the multiport bss can no longer be described by eq .",
    "[ eq : un ] . here",
    "we design a simple device that is oam preserving and can be described by the ut of eq .",
    "[ eq : u2 ] . fig .",
    "[ fig : oamsorter](c ) gives the schematic diagram of the device , which is a parallelepiped bs . a photon incident from port-@xmath34 is totally reflected by the left inner surface i before going to the @xmath10:@xmath38 bs ( interface ii ) , where @xmath10 and @xmath38 are the reflectivity and transmittivity of interface ii , respectively .",
    "the transmission part is reflected by the right inner surface iii and outputs from port-@xmath39 , whereas the reflection part outputs from port-@xmath40 directly . that is , @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , if the oam state @xmath42 is incident from port-@xmath43 , the output state becomes @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the parallelepiped device acts as a 2-dimensional ut to the incident oam state .",
    "this device is an elementary oam bs .",
    "any @xmath7-port - oam bs and ut can thus be realized by the elemental oam bss , mirrors and pms .",
    "the number of bss sufficient for a classical @xmath6-dimensional ut is @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 is the binomial coefficient .",

    "this disadvantage limits the applications of multiport bss for high - dimensional uts and high - dimensional oam sorters .",
    "this problem can be solved by decomposing the @xmath6-dimensional oam sorter into cascading structures , as shown in fig .",

    "<S> single photons with orbital angular momentums ( oam ) have attracted substantial attention from researchers . </S>",
    "<S> a single photon can carry infinite oam values theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> thus , oam photon states have been widely used in quantum information and fundamental quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> although there have been many methods for sorting quantum states with different oam values , the non - destructive and efficient sorter of high - dimensional oam remains a fundamental challenge . </S>",
    "<S> here , we propose a scalable oam sorter which can categorize different oam states simultaneously , meanwhile , preserve both oam and spin angular momentum ( sam ) . </S>",
    "<S> fundamental elements of the sorter are composed of symmetric multiport beam splitters ( bss ) and dove prisms with cascading structure , which in principle can be flexibly and effectively combined to sort arbitrarily high dimensional oam photons . </S>",
    "<S> the scalable structures proposed here greatly reduce the number of bss required for sorting high dimensional oam states . in view of the non - destructive and extensible features , </S>",
    "<S> the sorters can be used as fundamental devices not only for high - dimensional quantum information processing , but also for traditional optics . </S>"
