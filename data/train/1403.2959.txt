    "quantum discord has proved to be a resource for performing some quantum information and computation protocols @xcite .",
    "this approach of quantum correlation expresses a different type of correlation @xcite in comparison with entanglement , in which we are concerned about separability .",
    "quantum discord sheds a new light on the concept of correlation in composite systems and reveals that there are some separable , i.e. disentangled , multipartite states which possess quantum correlation and hence they can be employed as a resource for improving the quantum information processes , speeding up the quantum computation algorithms and/or performing the quantum communication protocols . despite the fact that entanglement looks at quantum correlation from the separability point of view",
    ", quantum discord can capture quantum correlation from the measurement perspective @xcite .",
    "however , calculation of quantum discord requires finding the best ( optimised ) measurement protocol to be performed on one part of the system , therefore , complicating the calculation of quantum discord and prevents one from obtaining an analytic closed - form of the formula for quantum discord in general .",
    "indeed , quantum discord is analytically calculated only for a few families of two - qubit states @xcite , for some reduced two - qubit states of pure three - qubit states , and also for a class of rank-2 mixed state of @xmath0 systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometric measure of quantum discord is another measure of quantum correlation , that is in general easier to be utilised for calculations of non - classical correlations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dakic _",
    "et al_. have demonstrated , by using a variety of polarisation - correlated photon pairs , that non - zero quantum discord is the necessary resource for remote state preparation @xcite .",
    "also , they show that the geometric measure of quantum discord is directly linked to the fidelity of remote state preparation for a broad class of states . this fact may provide an operational interpretation for this measure of quantumness .",
    "geometric discord is defined as the squared hilbert - schmidt distance between the state of the quantum system and the closest zero - discord state . for a bipartite state @xmath1 on the hilbert space @xmath2 , geometric discord @xmath3",
    "is defined as @xcite @xmath4 where minimisation is taken over the set of all zero - discord states @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the squared norm in the hilbert - schmidt space .",
    "an exact expression of @xmath7 for pure @xmath8 and arbitrary @xmath9 states are obtained @xcite .",
    "consider a bipartite state @xmath1 acting on the hilbert space @xmath10 .",
    "one can write @xmath1 in the bloch representation as @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the usual pauli matrices , and @xmath13 are generators of @xmath14 , fulfilling the following equations @xmath15 also @xmath16 with @xmath17 \\label{29}$ ] , and @xmath18 with @xmath19 $ ] denote local coherence vectors of two subsystems , and @xmath20 with @xmath21 \\label{31}$ ] is the correlation matrix of the state .",
    "it is shown that @xmath7 of @xmath22 states can be written as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 are eigenvalues of @xmath25 , in non - increasing order , and @xmath26 .    the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) , which describes the interaction of a single two - level atom with the quantised radiation field @xcite , has been the subject of numerous studies in the field of quantum optics due to the fact that this system shows behaviour which clearly illustrates physical concepts such as collapse and revival .",
    "furthermore , it has attracted much attention for the study of quantum correlations .",
    "a lot of studies have been devoted to understand the atom - field interaction and methods have been devised to create , control , and quantify quantum correlation between them both in the weak and strong coupling regimes @xcite .    in this paper , we specifically intend to investigate the quantum correlation of a system which exhibits decoherence .",
    "decoherence is an inevitable consequence when the quantum system is interacting with a surrounding environment .",
    "if energy transfer occurs between the system and environment , the dissipation process is the most important mechanism leading to decoherence .",
    "however , decoherence can happens even when energy is conserved in the system : in this case the process of phase damping ( dephasing ) reduces the quantum coherence of the system .",
    "considering the properties of environment is important to investigate its interaction with the quantum systems and decoherence ; the concepts of markovian and non - markovian processes that deal with the capability of the environment to possess memory of the system have been the subject of many studies . for example , the dynamical behavior of quantum correlation of bipartite systems is reviewed in @xcite where the authors compared the behavior of entanglement and quantum discord in non - markovian and markovian processes .",
    "moreover , milburn has shown that , even without explicitly model an environment and its interaction with the system , the dephasing process may occur due to quantum jumps in the evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "investigating the quantum discord of open systems has been the subject of several studies .",
    "for example , jara @xmath27 have studied the discording power of an interaction between a system and its enclosing bath , both with and without the assumption of the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , altintas @xmath27 have used the master equation of evolution of interacting atom and field and investigated the entanglement and quantum discord of atom - field interactions in strong coupling regime .",
    "also , dynamics of the geometric quantum discord was studied in @xcite , where the authors have employed a dissipative system of two independent atom - cavity - reservoirs , both in the strong and weak coupling regimes .    in the present paper , we investigate the dynamical behavior of quantum correlations of a system consisting of a two - level atom which interacts with a single - mode quantised radiation field .",
    "such systems are important in operational quantum information processing .",
    "in particular , this system is suitable for performing some quantum communication tasks , because it includes a stationary qubit ( atom ) and a flying qudit ( photon ) .",
    "the atom - field interaction is described by the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "we use the jcm in the weak coupling regime together with the rwa , and assume that our system undergoes a phase damping evolution caused by a decoherence process .",
    "the physics of this process could be quantum jumps of the atom - field state during the evolution .",
    "we focus on calculating the time - evolved state of the atom - field , where the atom is initially in a general mixed state and the field is initially in a pure state , i.e. number and coherent states , and investigate the quantum correlations between the atom and field . our algebraic method to calculate the geometric discord of the jcm",
    "is novel , in which the calculation of coherence vectors and correlation matrix in the jcm are carried out easily . in previous studies such as @xcite the pure dephasing evolution of the jcm has been considered , i.e. when the atom and field are both initially in pure states , but we consider here a more general case , when the initial state of the atom is a general mixed state .",
    "also , our analytic results enable us to evaluate the dynamics of the quantum correlations of the jcm such as negativity and geometric discord for various values of atomic mixedness of the system , and the atom - field detuning .",
    "our results reveal that although the asymptotic geometric discord of the system is negligible in the resonance and far resonance regions , it has a non - zero value for some intermediate detunings , and that we can find an optimum value for such asymptotic @xmath28 in an intermediate value of detuning .",
    "interestingly , a similar result is mentioned in @xcite for the negativity of the jcm and we show here how these two types of quantum correlation resemble each other in this view .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "pure dephasing evolution of the system is studied in section iii .",
    "section iv includes the calculation of the geometric discord for the two distinct initial states of the field i.e. number and coherent states . in section",
    "v , we present our results and conclude the paper with some discussions .",
    "the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) describes the interaction of a two - level atom with a single - mode quantised radiation field @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of this model is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the internal hamiltonian of the system and @xmath31 describes the atom - field interaction in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) and weak - coupling regime , where ( for @xmath32 ) @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the transition frequency of the two - level atom and the frequency of the radiation field , respectively , and @xmath36 denotes the atom - field coupling .",
    "note that the rwa and weak coupling regime are valid when @xmath37 .",
    "also @xmath38 , @xmath39 are atomic spin - flip operators , and @xmath40 is the atomic inversion operator which act on the atom hilbert space @xmath41 .",
    "also @xmath42 and @xmath43 are annihilation and creation operators of the field acting on the field hilbert space @xmath44 .",
    "the two - dimensional hilbert space of the atom is spanned by two orthonormal states @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the field hilbert space is spanned by the photon number states @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the vacuum state of the radiation field .    to achieve the time evolution of the system , it is convenient to use the dressed - state representation of the hamiltonian .",
    "regarding the fact that hamiltonian conserves the total number of excitations of the operator @xmath49 , one can decompose the atom - field hilbert space @xmath50 as @xmath51 such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 , are the eigen - subspaces of @xmath55 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "accordingly , hamiltonian has the eigenvalues @xmath58 with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the rabi frequency .",
    "also @xmath62 is the detuning parameter of the system .",
    "decoherence destroys the quantumness of the system and decreases the useful quantum correlations between on the parts of the system .",
    "there are several approaches to consider decoherence in a quantum system which are responsible for quantum - classical transition .",
    "one of these approaches is based on the modified schrdinger equation in such a way that the quantum coherence is automatically destroyed as the system evolves .",
    "this mechanism is called _ intrinsic decoherence _ and has been studied in the framework of several models ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , milburn has proposed a simple modification of the standard quantum mechanics based on the assumption that for sufficiently short time steps @xmath63 the system evolution is governed by a stochastic sequence of identical unitary transformations rather than a continuous unitary evolution @xcite .",
    "this assumption leads to a modification of schrdinger equation which includes a term corresponding to the decay of quantum coherence in the energy bases . using a poisson model for the stochastic time steps , milburn obtained the following dynamical master equation in the first order approximation @xcite @xmath64-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}[h,[h,{{\\rho ( t)}}]],\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the density matrix of the atom - field in any given time @xmath66 .",
    "equation has the following formal solution @xcite @xmath67 such that @xmath68 is the initial state of the system and @xmath69    in order to find the time - evolved state @xmath65 , we need to expand the initial state @xmath68 in terms of the dressed - states , i.e. the hamiltonian eigenbases , as @xmath70 inserting this in eq . we get @xmath71 where we have defined @xmath72    now let us suppose that , initially at @xmath73 , the system is found in the product state @xmath74 such that @xmath75 is the initial state of the atom and is considered to be a mixed state @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the initial state of the field , is assumed to be a pure state @xmath78 with @xmath79 , where the complex coefficients @xmath80 satisfy the normalisation condition @xmath81 . in section [ gd section ] , we will fix the coefficients @xmath82 for two special cases , namely number states and coherent states . accordingly , inserting eqs . - into eq . and using orthonormal bases @xmath83 for the atomic hilbert space , one can find , after tedious but straightforward calculations , the following representation for the density matrix @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , operators acting on the field hilbert space @xmath44 , are defined by @xmath89 where matrix elements of operators @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 in the fock bases @xmath93 are given by @xmath94\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\cos^{2}(\\theta_{n})\\big[\\sin^{2} ( \\theta_{m})\\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{nm}_{-+}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{nm}_{-+})^{2}\\big)\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\cos^{2} ( \\theta_{m})\\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{nm}_{--}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{nm}_{--})^{2}\\big)\\big]\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath95,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath96,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath97\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sin^{2}(\\theta _ { n-1})\\big[\\cos^{2}(\\theta_{m-1})\\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{n-1,m-1}_{-+}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{n-1,m-1}_{-+})^{2}\\big)\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sin^{2}(\\theta_{m-1})\\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{n-1,m-1}_{--}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{n-1,m-1}_{--})^{2}\\big)\\big ] \\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath98\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\cos^{2}(\\theta_{n})\\big[\\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{n , m-1}_{-+}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{n , m-1}_{-+})^{2}\\big)\\nonumber \\\\ & -\\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{n , m-1}_{--}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{n , m-1}_{--})^{2}\\big)\\big]\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath99\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\sin^{2}(\\theta_{m-1})\\big[\\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{n , m-1}_{+-}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{n , m-1}_{+-})^{2}\\big)\\nonumber \\\\ & + \\exp\\big(-i\\omega^{n , m-1}_{--}t-\\frac{\\gamma t}{2}(\\omega^{n , m-1}_{--})^{2}\\big)\\big]\\bigg].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we turn our attention on the geometric quantum discord of the state given by eq . .",
    "to do so , we should first note that the state is supported , actually , on a @xmath100 hilbert space and investigating the correlation properties of this system may appear to an impossible task .",
    "however , as we will show in the following sections , by considering some appropriate initial states for the field , our state at a given time @xmath101 can be represented by a @xmath102 matrix for a finite @xmath103 . in continue , we express two examples of these preparations .",
    "we first consider the case that the field is prepared , initially , in a given number state @xmath104 , i.e. the coefficients @xmath105 are set to be @xmath106 . in this particular case , the atom - field state @xmath84 of eq .",

    ", we consider the case that the field is initially in a coherent state @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath114 . although this initial condition implies a @xmath100 support for @xmath84 , the poissonian distribution of photon numbers in coherent states allows us to truncate the dimension of the field hilbert space to a finite one .",
    "numerically , it is seen that if we set @xmath115 the coefficients @xmath105s will be negligible for @xmath116 ; indeed , the ratio @xmath117 becomes less than @xmath118 for large enough values of @xmath119 , so it is reasonable to restrict the dimension of the field hilbert space to an appropriate @xmath103 . to fulfill the adequate accuracy in the case of @xmath115 ,",
    "numerical calculations have shown that @xmath120 is sufficient , such that @xmath121\\cong 1 $ ] , so we truncate @xmath44 to a 30-dimensional space .",
    "this approach was also employed in @xcite to calculate the negativity of the jcm where the system undergoes a unitary evolution , and the consideration of the initial states of the atom and field are the same as the present paper .",
    "we use the same approach to evaluate the dephasing evolution of the jcm , and it can be seen that just by setting the dephasing parameter @xmath63 equal to zero , i.e. the unitary evolution , the results of @xcite for the state of the system can be achieved .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of dephasing evolution , the 25-dimensional field hilbert space which is used in @xcite is no longer accurate in numerical calculations , so we have expanded this dimension to thirty .",
    "now we focus on calculating the @xmath7 of the atom - field state while the field is initially in the mentioned coherent state .",

    "the evolution of the state of the system and hence the dynamics of the quantum correlations strongly depend on the initial state of the system .",

    "+ also , it is worthwhile to discuss how correlation can survive in an off - resonant system while they do not survive in the resonant case .",
    "the quantum correlation can resulted either from a resonant transfer of energy between the atom and the field , or from dispersive energy shifts affecting the atoms and the photons when they are not resonant @xcite .",
    "the fact is that , although the system gains significant amounts of correlation in the resonant case , this correlation is vulnerable to dephasing and can not survive . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum correlation of the system in off - resonant case is rather robust to the dephasing process and are longer - lasting . strictly speaking",
    ", the energy transfer process dominates the resonant atom and field , while the latter dominates the far off - resonant system .",
    "our results indicate that although the contributions of the two above processes change as we alter the detuning , the ability of the system to gain correlation is generally remarkable for detunings between zero up to some intermediate value ( notice figure [ fig1 ] ) , while this ability decreases for larger detunings ; so we can conclude that the ability of the system to gain correlation does not immediately wane by an increase in detuning , but the reduction of this ability occurs when the detuning is greater than some intermediate value .",
    "in addition , the immunity of the system to the dephasing is very important , and it strongly depends on the initial state of the system , and also on the amount of detuning . speaking about the immunity ,",
    "the coherent elements ( off - diagonal elements ) of expression shown in are fragile to dephasing , and vanish at large times , so their influence in maintaining correlation of the system is highly dependent on the dephasing process .",
    "but since the energy of the atom - field system is conserved , the population elements of are invariant and their correspondence in the quantum correlation of the system can survive . we speculate that for the initial state , the resonant transfer of energy between atom and field which dominates the behaviour of the correlation in a resonant system is highly relevant to the coherent elements of , while for an off - resonant system , the amounts of correlation is more relevant to the population elements , and accordingly , is more robust against the dephasing processes .",
    "the fact is that detuning changes the energy levels of the atom - field system and the coherent and population elements of the evolution , so it influences both the ability of system to create correlation and the immunity of correlation to the dephasing .",
    "mathematically , consider the density matrix of to be the sum of two matrices as below @xmath174 where the @xmath175 shows the diagonal elements of @xmath84 corresponding with energy levels of hamiltonian ( 5 ) and @xmath176 corresponds with off - diagonal elements of the density matrix ( 14 ) .",
    "expanded in detail , we have @xmath177 and since the energy of the system is conserved , this matrix is time - invariant , whereas @xmath176 vanishes at large times because of dephasing .",
    "accordingly , we have @xmath178 .",
    "it is evident that the off - diagonal elements of @xmath175 in the standard atom - field representation ( not dressed states ) are crucial in quantum correlation of the system , and they depend on both the initial state of the system , @xmath68 , and the parameter @xmath179 ( see ) which determines the energy levels of the system .",
    "so for a given @xmath68 , the parameter @xmath179 governs @xmath180 and consequently determines the amounts of correlation of the system at asymptotically large times .",
    "therefore , both the parameters @xmath131 and @xmath36 should be taken into account to study the asymptotic correlation of the system ( also @xmath119 is important when the initial state of the field is a number state ) .",
    "with respect to our assumption for the initial state , the state @xmath181 is correlation - free when the system is in resonance , whereas , it contains correlations for the off - resonant case . since asymptotic geometric discord is a positive function vanishing at @xmath138 and large values of @xmath131 , according to the rolle s theorem it must have a maximum at some intermediate detuning i.e. @xmath182 .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the dynamical behavior of the geometric discord and negativity of a bipartite system including a two - level atom , prepared initially in a mixture of ground and excited states , and a quantised radiation field , prepared in a general pure number / coherent initial state .",
    "the internal interaction is modelled by the jcm in the weak coupling approximation .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix of the composite system is studied under pure dephasing process .",
    "the results of this paper show that dephasing , induced by intrinsic decoherence , is competing with internal interaction to create an asymptotic value of quantum correlation after some coherence oscillation .",
    "hence the amount of quantum correlation of the system reaches a stationary value , asymptotically .",
    "the dynamical and asymptotic behavior of the geometric discord depend on the initial conditions and the system parameters .",
    "indeed , the effects of dephasing can be amplified or weakened by adjusting both the parameters of the model and the initial conditions .",
    "we have also shown that the asymptotic geometric discord reaches its maximum value at an intermediate non - zero value of atom - field detuning .",
    "this system can be employed for implementation of the quantum remote state preparation protocol and the results help to improve the fidelity of this task .",
