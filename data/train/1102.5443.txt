    "modulations of the local density of states in cuprates , which were observed by scanning tunneling microscopy in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bi2212 ) @xcite and ca@xmath2na@xmath3cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 @xcite , have attracted significant attention .",
    "although a number of theories for these observations have been proposed , @xcite the nature of the modulated state is still debated .",
    "the modulations are strongest in the underdoped region of the phase diagram , a faithful description of which could be a difficult task .",
    "fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter , intrinsic disorder , and competing / coexisting order , all potentially play a role in underdoped samples .",
    "nevertheless , short of knowing the exact hamiltonian governing the low energy phenomenology of the cuprates , it is instructive to isolate the role of separate contributions by focusing on one of them at a time .",
    "the goal of this article is to study the influence of the electronic dispersion in determining the nature of potential charge density waves in cuprates .",
    "this is realized by deriving a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy and analyzing the symmetry of the possible charge modulations , with the coefficients of the free energy determined from dispersions extracted from angle - resolved photoemission data .",
    "our starting point is the generalized extended hubbard model of interacting electrons on a tight binding square lattice . in terms of electron creation operators",
    "@xmath4 , the hamiltonian of the model is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the energy dispersion ( with @xmath7 the chemical potential ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the sites of the lattice , and @xmath10 is the charge density .",
    "the model reduces to the hubbard model when @xmath11 , and to the so - called @xmath12-@xmath13 ( extended hubbard ) model when @xmath14 is also non zero for the nearest neighbor sites @xmath15 .    , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "]    as a function of the charge - density - wave order parameter @xmath19 , the effective gl free energy ( per lattice site ) to quartic order can be written as @xmath20 where the summations are performed over the momenta @xmath21 and the bosonic matsubara frequencies @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the free energy of the normal state ( @xmath24 ) , and the notation @xmath25 is used for brevity .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion can be expressed through greens functions @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "after summation over fermionic frequencies @xmath29 , one obtains the usual result for the ( 2d ) charge susceptibility @xmath30 with the integral over the first brillouin zone . in our mean field theory , we only need the cubic and quartic coefficient functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 @xmath34\\ ] ] where @xmath35 denotes the two other terms obtained by cyclic permutation of the momenta @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath32 one finds @xmath37 where @xmath35 denotes the three other terms obtained by cyclic permutation of the momenta @xmath38 .     +    as the temperature or the effective interaction @xmath14 varies , for a specific set of equivalent momenta @xmath39 , the quadratic coefficient of the gl expansion may change sign , and a phase transition takes place .",
    "in the vicinity of such a transition , it is sufficient to consider only the coefficients of the gl free energy evaluated at momenta @xmath39 and their harmonics",
    ". we will be specifically interested in situations where these equivalent momenta lie along the symmetry lines of the brillouin zone , and thus the total number of them is restricted to four for the square lattice ( typically , the maxima of @xmath40 will lie along such lines ) .",
    "consider first a simplified expansion where only the fundamental harmonics at @xmath39 are retained .",
    "in such a case , the gl expansion reduces to @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath33 is implied , and the coefficients @xmath44 , which are described by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ si ] , are defined as @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "formally identical gl expansions have been studied in the past , and for a momentum - independent interaction have been recently employed by yao _",
    "_ in connection with cdws that occur in the rare earth tri - tellurides ( ref .  )",
    "the stability requirement dictates that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "provided these are satisfied , the symmetry of the cdw in the ordered phase is determined @xcite by @xmath49 : when @xmath50 , the free energy is minimized by choosing either @xmath51 or @xmath52 resulting in one - dimensional stripes . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the minimum of the gl free energy is achieved by choosing @xmath54 , and the cdw has a two - dimensional `` checkerboard '' pattern .",
    "the calculations were performed for three sets of six - parameter tight - binding fits to the dispersion , based on angle - resolved photoemission data , that were previously used to model the spin susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of these dispersions ( tb1 , tb2 , and tb4 ) can be found in that work .",
    "tb1 is based on earlier photoemission data for bi2212 @xcite and is characterized by a van hove singularity at @xmath55 that is 34 mev below the fermi energy , resulting in a sizable anisotropy of the fermi velocity around the fermi surface .",
    "tb2 is based on more recent photoemission data for bi2212 @xcite which indicates an isotropic fermi velocity .",

    "there are two sets of maxima .",
    "one set forms a box - like structure around the zone center , and it is this set which will be assumed to dominate the charge response since we anticipate that @xmath58 will be maximal at @xmath59 .",
    "the second set is concentrated around the @xmath60 point , and is thought to dominate the spin response since the superexchange interaction is maximal at this point .",
    "for the first set , the absolute maximum of @xmath40 typically occurs along the zone diagonal ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this can be qualitatively understood by employing an argument due to schulz @xcite .",
    "although a bond centered vector does a better job of nesting the antinodal sections of the fermi surface near @xmath55 , a diagonal vector connects twice as many fermi surface faces .",
    "therefore , were it not for the momentum dependence of the interaction , one would conclude that the cdw typically can not be directed along the bond directions , at least within the model considered here .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the susceptibility does not diverge , even at @xmath62 , unless the faces of the fermi surfaces are perfectly nested .",
    "this is never the case for a realistic dispersion , although the fermi surface does contain approximately nested sections that are responsible for the sharp peaks in @xmath40 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_t_0 ] for the peak lying along @xmath63 .",
    "the discontinuities of the slope at momenta @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( which define the plateau in the insets ) are due to the points of the fermi surface @xmath66 and @xmath67 separated by @xmath68 such that the tangents to the fermi surface at @xmath66 and @xmath67 are parallel .",
    "the lack of divergence in the susceptibility implies that the charge - density wave can develop only if the interaction strength exceeds a critical value .",

    "for dispersions tb1 and tb4 , the susceptibility has two cusps , corresponding to momenta connecting points in a quadrant of the zone ( shown for tb1 by the dots ) with their partners in the adjacent quadrant .",
    "the characteristic bending of the fermi surface near the antinodal direction , which is similar for the tb1 and tb4 fits , is absent for the tb2 dispersion where the susceptibility has a single cusp . in all cases , on one side of each cusp at @xmath69 ,",
    "the slope of @xmath70 is finite , while on the other side , @xmath71 and the slope is infinite . ]",
    "the ordering vector in cuprates observed by scanning tunneling microscopy lies along the cu - o bonds , in contrast with our results for @xmath40 . on the other hand ,",
    "the true ordering vector is determined by the product of @xmath40 and @xmath72 .",
    "we anticipate that @xmath58 has a maximum at @xmath59 and falls off smoothly with increasing @xmath73 . if this fall off is relatively isotropic and steep enough , then , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_line_tb1_together ] , this can lead to ordering along the bond direction instead , since @xmath73 along the diagonal of the box structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : colormap_chi ] is @xmath74 times larger than @xmath73 along the bond direction . in general , the momentum @xmath75 at which the charge - density instability occurs is determined by the highest temperature such that the condition @xmath76 is satisfied . for concreteness",
    ", we assume that the interaction has the following simplified form : @xmath77 at small momenta .    given this form of the interaction ,",
    "the first task is to identify the momentum @xmath78 and the temperature @xmath79 at which the cdw first develops .",

    "[ fig : instability_diagram ] , the solutions generally fall in four different classes . for a fixed curvature @xmath80 , there are no solutions provided that @xmath81 is large enough .",
    "this was to be expected , as the logarithmic divergence of the susceptibility is cut off due to imperfect nesting .",
    "thus , for sufficiently weak interactions , no ordering occurs even at @xmath62 . in the opposite limit of strong interactions and medium- to long - range interactions ,",
    "the instability is at @xmath59 .",
    "this is due to the strong reduction in the momentum dependence of @xmath40 as the temperature is raised , as can be appreciated from fig .",

    "[ fig : instability_diagram ] .",
    "the reason is that the parabolic approximation we apply for @xmath85 is only valid near @xmath59 .",
    "we anticipate that for larger values of @xmath73 , the charge interaction is suppressed , and the magnetic interactions become dominant instead .",
    "( color online ) depending on the momentum dependence of the interaction @xmath58 , a cdw with modulations along the cu - o bonds ( @xmath63 ) can be stabilized despite the fact that the maximum of the susceptibility along this direction is smaller than the peak value along @xmath86 .",

    "this instability implies the necessity to include higher - order terms in the gl free energy expression for that part of the parameter space .",
    "these terms would generally restore the stability of the gl free energy , but would result in a first - order transition that can not be described in any quantitative way using our approach . at the transition temperature @xmath79 , a finite amplitude of @xmath140 develops , and",
