    "the interconnections between gw , neutrino and gamma astronomy are so strong that multi - wavelength approaches are essential to provide the most complete possible picture of astrophysical sources and scientific communities working in these fields should hopefully increase their level of interaction .",

    "consistent results were obtained by another deeper magnetic spectrometer , opera , that intercepts the cngs neutrino beam from cern at the national laboratory of gran sasso @xcite . while opera is dedicated to @xmath54 appearance discovery , at this conference they proved their cosmic ray capability by measuring the muon charge ratio for single and multiple muons .",

    "it took about 35 yrs since markov conceived the neutrino telescope ( nt ) detection principle @xcite to the operation of the first complete detector .",
    "nts are challenging instruments to build , while they use the well established technique of photomultipliers .",
    "the difficulties for construction arise from : the necessity of instrumenting extremely large regions due to the small neutrino cross section and to the steep decrease of incoming neutrino fluxes of atmospheric and astrophysical origin ; the darkness and transparency of the medium requirements to detect the faint cherenkov light produced by ultra - relativistic charged particles ; the need for filtering neutrino events out of the more abundant atmospheric muons .",
    "detectors are located under 1 - 4 km of water or ice where the downward - going background of atmospheric muons is about @xmath108 orders of magnitudes larger than the atmospheric neutrino flux for @xmath109  gev coming from all directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "nts are tridimensional matrices of photodetectors made of strings of optical modules that house large photocathode pmts and protect them from the water column pressure when they are installed in the sea or in lakes and from the pressure during ice refreezing for antarctic detectors .",
    "neutrinos interact with the medium nuclei in and around the detector through charged and neutral current interactions and charged relativistic secondaries produce light .",
    "various event topologies can be identified : muons , cascades and composite events made of tracks and cascades . in the case of cascades , that are point - like events given the scale of these sparse detectors , light radiates almost isotropically .",
    "analyses using cascade topology are at a less advanced stage in icecube and antares , while baikal presented very interesting results on this topology @xcite . in fact , because of the limited dimension of the detector and the shallow depth of 1.1 km , reconstruction of muons is hampered by the limited number of degrees of freedom and the larger atmospheric muon background .",
    "the latest configuration of the baikal experiment ( nt-200 ) was put into operation in april 1998 .",
    "it consists of an umbrella - like structure of 8 ( 72  m long ) strings , with 24 pairs of up - looking and down - looking pmts ( containing 37-cm photocatodes developed for the project , called quasar-370 ) .",
    "three external strings at 100  m from the center of nt200 , each with 12 pairs of oms , have been added in april 2005 to increase the cascade sensitivity at very high energies ( nt200 + ) .    in icecube ,",
    "reconstruction of neutrino induced cascades is challenged by scattering of light in the ice .",
    "the slight anisotropy in the direction of high energy primary neutrinos should allow a resolution of the order of @xmath110 while the energy resolution is @xmath111log@xmath112 between 20 tev and a few pev @xcite .",
    "other topologies are shown in fig .",
    "[ left_fig4 ] and they are induced by tau neutrinos @xcite .",
    "one of these is considered background free and called `` double - bang '' due to the presence of two separated cascades induced by the hadronic interaction of @xmath54 and the hadronic or electromagnetic shower produced in the tau decay . in order to reconstruct 2 cascades separately in a detector like icecube",
    "the tau track must be at least of the order of 100 m. hence this topology is limited in energy to the range of a few pev for the tau track to be long enough , up to about 100 pev to contain the two cascades in the instrumented volume ( the @xmath113 range is 1 km at about 200 pev ) .",
    "muons propagate along lines for long distances and constitute the `` golden sample '' for neutrino astronomy since the achievable angular resolution is at sub - degree level . at energies",
    "@xmath114 tev the kinematic angle between @xmath19 and secondary muons is negligible with respect to the intrinsic tracking resolution due to scattering of light in the cherenkov medium and to the time resolution of pmts .",
    "hence , muons can be used to point back to neutrino astrophysical sources .",
    "while iacts can prove their point spread function on copious sources of gammas such as the crab nebula , no astrophysical neutrino source has proved to exist yet .",
    "hence , the ` standard candle ' for neutrino telescopes can be an ` anti - source ' , such as the moon shadow . the moon disk , with a diameter of about @xmath115 , blocks primary cosmic rays hence producing a deficit in the muon flux .",
    "icecube , using 3 months of data of the 40 string configuration , begins to find evidence at @xmath116 level of this deficit , which is a proof of the absolute pointing capability of the detector @xcite .",
    "the moon at the south pole is never higher than @xmath117 , so this tests an important region for the expected astrophysical neutrino signal .",
    "in fact , the astrophysical signal ( with characteristic spectrum of @xmath51 from acceleration mechanisms at sources ) begins to emerge from the more steeply falling atmospheric neutrino background above about 1 - 10 tev . at pev energies",
    "the earth shadowing effect on neutrinos is no more negligible , hence at very high energy most of the neutrinos can only be seen in the horizontal region .",
    "icecube is able to test the angular resolution for less inclined events also using events in coincidence with the extensive air shower ( eas ) icetop .",
    "antares is instead evaluating the possibility to measure coincident events using a scintillator array on a boat .",
    "the icecube observatory consists of a deep detector with instrumented strings between 1.5 and 2.5 km below the surface and icetop made of two surface tanks at a distance of about 10 m corresponding to each deep string @xcite .",
    "in 2 austral summers at the south pole , construction will be completed for a total of 86 strings , 160 tanks , 4800 10 `` inch pmts and 360 high quantum efficiency pmts for the deep core . in the final configuration",
    "the angular resolution at energies between 10 - 100 tev will be such that about 50% of the reconstructed muons from the direction of a neutrino point source will be inside @xmath115 .",
    "a better angular resolution at the level of @xmath118 should be achievable in sea water as indicated by simulation studies with antares @xcite .",
    "the construction of the undersea neutrino observatory antares , located at about 2.5  km below sea surface off - shore toulon in south france , took several years .",
    "since 1996 , the collaboration has deployed many strings to monitor the environmental parameters of water , the permanent electro - optical cable of about 40  km , transmitting data and power between the shore station in la seyne sur mer , and the junction box off shore that is operating since november 2002 . in 2006 ,",
    "the first 2 lines of the detector were deployed and 8 additional lines were disposed in 2007 . on may 2008 the complete nt , made out of a total of 12 lines , was put into operation .",
    "lines were connected during 5 submarine operations , one conducted by a submarine and all others by an unmanned remote operated vehicle .",
    "the antares observatory comprises 12 mooring lines , a line specifically dedicated to marine environmental monitoring , a seismometer , and a biocamera for bioluminescence studies .",
    "the lines are anchored to sea bed at 2475  m depth and held vertical by buoys .",
    "buoys are freely floating so each line moves under the effect of the sea current , with movements of a few meters for typical values of 5  cm / s .",
    "an acoustic positioning system , made of transponders and receivers , gives a real time measurement of the position of the oms with a precision better than 10  cm , typically every 2 minutes and tiltmeters and compasses provide their orientation @xcite .",
    "seventy - five oms along each lines between about 2400 and 2000  m are grouped in triples on storeys .",
    "the 3 pmts ( hamamtsu 10 '' ) look downward , at @xmath119 from the vertical , to prevent transparency loss due to sedimentation .",
    "storeys also include titanium containers housing the front - end electronics .",
    "each of the oms contains a pulsed led for calibration of the relative variations of pmt transit time and a system of led and laser optical beacons allows the relative time calibration of different oms .",
    "an internal clock system , which is synchronized by gps to the universal time with a precision of @xmath120  ns , distributes the 20 mhz clock signal from the shore .",
    "time calibrations allow a precision at the level of 0.5  ns ensuring the capability of achieving an angular resolution at the level of @xmath118 , for muons above 10 tev  @xcite .",
    "all data above a threshold of about 1/3 of a photoelectron pulse is sent to shore for further online filtering .",
    "this requires coincidences between pmts on the same storey and coincidences between hits compatible with light propagation in water  @xcite .",
    "point - like source searches have various advantages compared to diffuse ones .",
    "first of all , the directionality of the signal helps to discriminate the background of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "many ` equivalent experiments ' with only background can be reproduced by scrambling the right ascension of data .",
    "this has the advantage that data can be used for estimating the background rather then simulation , so that resulting significances are not affected by imperfect understanding of the detector and detector medium , of signal and background .",
    "likelihood methods @xcite are used to discriminate between the signal + background hypothesis and the background only one .",
    "signal is characterized with respect to background by the source directional feature and by the harder spectrum expected from astrophysical sources compared to atmospheric neutrinos . for the case of time",
    "dependent sources , such as periodical binaries as micro - quasars or flares from blazars , also periodicity assumptions or light curves from gamma , x - ray and optical telescopes can be used as parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "icecube recently published results for the 22 string configuration with 5114 events from the northern hemisphere collected in 276 days and a hot spot was found with a post - trial probability of 1.34% to be due to background fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the significance was driven to such values by 3 high energy events of a few hundreds of tev .",
    "icecube field of view ( fov ) has been extended to a part of the southern hemisphere using energy cuts to reduce the background of atmospheric muons .",
    "hence , in this part of the sky icecube is sensitive to pev sources @xcite . at the conference ,",
    "new results from 6 months of data of the 40 string configuration , that encompass in sensitivity all previous samples , have been presented @xcite .",
    "the statistical fluctuation observed with 22 strings was not confirmed with the larger statistics sample , indicating that the hot spot was a statistical fluctuation . no signal has been found and upper limits have been set that are the best limits available for the northern hemisphere .",
    "this analysis extends the fov of icecube to the entire sky with the caveat that icecube is sensitive to tev - pev source in the northern hemisphere where the on - off technique is done using atmospheric neutrinos at a rate of 39/day , and to pev - eev sources from the southern hemisphere where the method is applied to 62/day high energy atmospheric muons .",

    "the sky - map of all events used for point - source searches is shown in fig .",

    "it is also interesting to understand how well the likelihood method would reconstruct the spectral index of a source of different intensities .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ right_fig5 ] .",
    "the relatively good ability of nts to reconstruct spectra even for a limited energy resolution of @xmath121log@xmath122 ) is due to the wide energy range over which they operate ( between about 100 gev to eev energies ) : detected events provides a long lever arm for spectral reconstruction .",
    "antares , that uses another unbinned method called expectation - maximization method @xcite , presented the first results with the 5-line configuration @xcite .",
    "a collection of all results for point source searches is presented in fig .",

    "various target of opportunity programs ( toos ) are ongoing between neutrino telescopes , optical and gamma telescopes as well as with gw interferometers .",
    "icecube has activated a program with the rotse - iii optical telescopes for monitoring high energy neutrino emission from sne and gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "multiplets of at least two muon neutrinos within @xmath123 arriving in a 100 s time window are sent as alerts to the network of optical telescopes that look for transient objects .",
    "an alert rate of 25 yr@xmath88 is estimated .",
    "if no sn is detected by 40 strings of icecube , the rate of sne with mildly relativistic jets is @xmath124 mpc@xmath125 yr@xmath88 ( 90% c.l . ) .",
    "antares is collaborating for a similar program with tarot and sending multiplets and high energy events @xcite .",
    "another program involves icecube and magic : interesting ( at @xmath126 level the event rate is 2 yr@xmath88 ) icecube events clustered in time and from selected blazars will be sent to magic @xcite .",
    "also an analysis of interesting events for antares and gw interferometers , virgo and ligo @xcite , is being activated with an alert expected rate of 1 every 600 yrs .",
    "no one can yet predict the pay - off of these too programs between experiments that have yet seen no signal .",
    "traditionally target of opportunity programs have been activated between experiments that know well their signal and the background .",
    "diffuse fluxes from extra - galactic sources are more promising compared to single source fluxes in terms of event rates and because the signal may extend up to the highest energies .",
    "nonetheless , these searches have to rely more on simulations than point source searches .",
    "the basic concept is that the astrophysical signal should show up at high energies above the atmospheric neutrino background given the harder spectrum .",
    "this implies that these searches are affected by theoretical uncertainties on high energy atmospheric neutrino fluxes ( see sec .",
    "[ sub - neu ] ) and on the experimental errors in the high energy region were the statistics is low .",
    "results at this conference from icecube are preliminary for the muon topology @xcite and for cascades @xcite . other results from baikal @xcite and amanda @xcite are also shown in fig .",
    "[ right_fig6 ] . in the same figure , at ehe energies , current limits for cosmogenic neutrinos",

    "also extensive air shower experiments look for such high energy neutrinos at the horizon @xcite , where the cosmic ray showers are suppressed by the large atmosphere layer .",
    "radio detectors look for the coherent cherenkov radiation produced by excess of electrons in neutrino induced showers in dense media ( askaryan effect ) such as ice @xcite and the lunar regolith @xcite .",
    "the main issue on the lunar regolith technique is the high threshold , above the expected peak of cosmogenic neutrino fluxes .",
    "various proposed experiments for gamma - astronomy have been presented at the conference , as well as upgrades to existing detectors .",
    "veritas is planning the relocation of one of the telescopes to improve the sensitivity by about 15% , as well as upgrades of the cameras with high qe pmts .",
    "if a fifth telescope would be added , the time to get to 1% of crab would be halved compared to the current one of @xmath129  hrs @xcite . by the end of 2009",
    "the 4 telescope system hess will be upgraded with a new 28m - diameter telescope to lower the threshold to about 30 gev @xcite and achieve an angular resolution before cuts of @xmath130 at @xmath131  gev .",
    "magic ii has concluded the commissioning phase and has seen the first light .",
    "it is expected that 1% of the crab will be observed in 50 hrs for @xmath132 gev .",
    "the energy threshold is about 60  gev @xcite .",
    "magic is planning a camera upgrade using hybrid photon detectors ( hpds ) @xcite .",
    "these hamamtsu devices consist of gaasp photocathodes and a 3 mm diameter avalanche photodiode acting as an electron bombarded anode with additional internal gain .",
    "they have good single photoelectron resolution and achieve a quantum efficiency ( qe ) of about 50% at 500 nm , though the qe at 300 - 400  nm decreases sharply .",
    "this aspect could make geiger - mode avalanche photodiodes ( g - apds , previously known as sipm ) more interesting though wavelength shifters can be used for applications in gamma - astronomy .",
    "g - apds devices are compact and light semiconductor photodetectors operated at very low voltage ( @xmath133 v ) , that are not affected by light or magnetic fields , contrary to pmts @xcite .",
    "they are operated in geiger discharge mode and the avalanched stopped using a quenching resistor or an active quenching circuit .",
    "the gain is of the order of @xmath134 and linear in the overvoltage ( bias voltage minus breakdown voltage ) but since the breakdown voltage depends on temperature the bias voltage has to be adjusted when the temperature changes to keep the gain constant .",
    "this is the main challenge of operating these devices .",
    "nowadays , they are also operated at room temperature and in the presence of high night sky background .",
    "a very interesting feature is the extremely high qe up to 65% at 400  nm and 30% at 300  nm .",
    "a prototype camera is operated at eth in zurich and they will be employed in the long - term monitoring of blazars project dwarf @xcite .",
    "r&d on these new devices for iacts cameras and other applications ( e.g. direct detection of dm ) should be encouraged . aside from improving camera detectors , other factors in sensitivity can be gained by implementing at trigger level gamma / hadron discrimination techniques @xcite or improving analyses tools @xcite .",
    "a summary plot of sensitivities is in fig .",
    "[ left_fig7 ] for past , present and future projects .",
    "the main aim in gamma astronomy is to fill the unexplored gap of energy between about 10 gev where fermi - lat begins to run out of statistics and current iact thresholds of a few hundreds of gev .",
    "the goal is to gain about a factor of 10 - 20 in sensitivity by improving the angular resolution to pin down the morphology of sources and precisely determine the emission regions , increasing areas and duty cycle .",
    "it is also important to increase the field of view of detectors to observe extended regions .",
    "in fact many observations of galactic sources , have revealed extended regions accelerating particles above tens of tev , such as the milagro pevatrons @xcite , between which there is geminga , never observed by iacts , probably because it is too extended",
    ". these can be sources of galactic cosmic rays as well as it is possible that cosmic rays are produced in enormous super - bubbles in the interstellar medium @xcite as some observations of extended hadronic sources seem to hint at @xcite .",
    "the scientific community is aiming at satisfying these goals by proposing arrays of tens of iacts , such as cta @xcite or agis @xcite , and much cheaper extensive air shower ( eas ) arrays , such as hawc @xcite .",
    "other proposed arrays combine all of these techniques @xcite .",
    "the arrays of iacts will guarantee a better angular resolution by at least a factor of two with respect to current detectors ( see fig .",
    "[ right_fig7 ] ) .",
    "cta is following a more conservative approach for what concern telescope mirrors than agis that is proposing new schwartzchild - couder optics with a primary and secondary mirror .",
    "cta is planning an array with variable size telescopes and variable baselines : a core of about 4 - 6 large telescopes with diameters @xmath135 m and fov @xmath136 will be dedicated to low energies up to about 10 gev , an array of davies - cotton telescopes with 10 - 12 m diameters and fov of @xmath137 for intermediate energies and many @xmath138  m diameter telescopes with large fov ( @xmath139 ) at large baselines for covering large energies .",
    "optimal sites for such arrays should be between 2000 - 3000 a.s.l . hopefully it will be possible to build two arrays in the 2 hemispheres to cover the entire sky by joining international efforts . a conceptual design of a 23 m diameter telescope capable of achieving a low energy threshold , with low weight ( 50 tons ) and with a carbon fiber mechanical structure for fast rotations optimal for transient sources was presented in @xcite .",
    "the idea behind hawc @xcite is to have an upgraded detector respect to milagro , with a modular structure , that could be ready to operate in less than 3 years to monitor the sky at tev energies , whereas fermi would cover the lower energy range . with a modular structure made of 300 tanks of water spread over an area of about @xmath140 m@xmath13 it is possible to improve the hadron / gamma discrimination with respect to milagro . by building the detector at 4100 m@xmath13 on a sierra negra ( mexico ) plateau",
    ", the energy threshold can be lowered thanks to the higher statistics of particles close to shower maximum . though hawc will monitor the available portion of the sky at mexican latitudes with 100% of duty cycle , the angular resolution ( not yet optimized )",
    "will be worse ( about @xmath141 for @xmath142  tev ) by about an order of magnitude than cta / agis ( see fig .",
    "[ right_fig7 ] ) .",
    "this is comprehensible since the cost is more than an order of magnitude lower for hawc with respect to cta / agis .",
    "this complementary strategy is a good approach to address the remaining discovery areas for gamma - astronomy , such as transient sources and gamma - ray bursts , and long term monitoring of blazars and extended regions of hadronic production .    in the field of neutrino",
    "astronomy r&d programs are also going on .",
    "the km3net consortium has finalized the conceptual design of a future cubic - kilometer scale detector in the mediterranean with a sensitivity 2 - 3 times better at high energy than icecube thanks to the better angular resolution achievable in sea water @xcite .",
    "the project is studying tower structures and their configuration to maximize performances .",
    "since this project is sensitive to a wide region of interest for galactic sources and to the galactic centre , the configuration of strings should be such that at 1 - 100 tev the sensitivity of the detector is better than icecube sensitivity .",
    "finally , together with radio programs to extend neutrino astronomy to the scale of 100 km@xmath13 , r&d on acoustic detection of uhe neutrinos is being performed at the antares @xcite and baikal @xcite sites in water and at icecube site in antarctica @xcite .",
    "acoustic detection of neutrinos is based on the thermal energy deposition of the induced particle cascade that produces a bipolar acoustic pulse in the khz range .",
    "acoustic energy thresholds for neutrinos are around @xmath143  ev . to extend nts to 100 km@xmath13 , an attenuation length much larger than the one in",
    "the optical is desirable for new techniques .",
    "water seems more promising than ice since the attenuation length is of the order 1 km , hence about a factor of 10 respect to the optical one . in ice it seems to be of the order of 200 - 350 m. given the large scattering of light in ice , this is about a factor of 10 with respect to the attenuation length in ice , but still much smaller than in sea water . on the other hand",
    ", water is a noisy environment . in sea water mammals",
    "are detected as well as surface noise correlated to winds , while in baikal noise increases during ice coverage / melting periods .",
    "a prototype @xcite made of an acoustic antenna 150 m deep and an imitator has been installed close to nt200 + .",
    "the achieved angular resolution is @xmath144 in azimuth and @xmath115 in zenith .",
    "about 7000 acoustic pulses were detected between apr .- may 2009 and all of them are down - going but one that is up - going and is not explained . hence , this technique is not background free , and background understanding is challenging .",
    "amadeus ( antares modules for acoustic detection under the sea ) @xcite is using 3 storeys of the antares detector to host acoustic devices with a bandpass filter from 1 khz to 100 khz .",
    "they proved capability of identification of transient backgrounds with the beamforming technique , that is the coherent sum of sound waves sampled by hydrophones , and produced a map where most of the noise is from the upper hemisphere and in the lower hemisphere the antares pingers on the lines are visible .",
    "most of the results presented at this conference on neutrino astronomy and dm are upper limits , even if icecube has showed point - source results for 6 months of data taken with 1/2 of its full configuration ( 40 strings ) .",
    "these limits are beginning to be in the region of interest between @xmath145 tev @xmath87 s@xmath88 for galactic sources and diffuse flux limits are approaching the waxman & bahcall upper limit on extra - galactic neutrino fluxes . according to estimates based on gamma observations , it is possible that @xmath146 years of icecube will be needed to achieve @xmath116 significance for milagro pevatrons @xcite .",
    "another detector in the opposite hemisphere would cover the entire sky and be sensitive to the galactic centre region , while icecube has sensitivity to cygnus that is observed by milagro up to tens of tev .",
    "studies and r&d for detectors of the order of 10 - 100 times icecube are a promising strategy for the future , but no technique is yet available at a reasonable cost for the same energy threshold as current nts .",
    "in fact , radio techniques that are very promising to achieve 100 km@xmath13 , have thresholds of the order of @xmath147 ev suitable for cosmogenic neutrinos but considerably higher than icecube",
    ".    gamma astronomy future programs aim at pushing the energy threshold as low as possible to fill the gap from fermi - glast and possibly observe close - by gamma - ray bursts with ground based arrays in the tev range . in the future",
    ", arrays of iact telescopes can be suitable for this scope joining the european and american communities .",
    "r&d for camera detectors should be strongly encouraged . in the meanwhile large fov arrays with 100% duty cycles",
    "could monitor the tev sky complementing at higher energies fermi - glast .",
