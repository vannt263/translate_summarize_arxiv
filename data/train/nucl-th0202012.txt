    "the production of @xmath0 mesons in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) collisions near the threshold energy has been a subject of considerable interest in the past few years , since the existing data are by far the most accurate and complete among those for heavy meson production .",
    "consequently , they provide an opportunity to investigate this reaction in much more detail than any of the other heavy meson production reactions .",
    "in addition to the total cross section for the @xmath3 reaction @xcite , we now have data for @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite reactions .",
    "the differential cross section data for the @xmath6 reaction @xcite are also available .",
    "consequently , there have been a large number of theoretical investigations on these reactions @xcite .",
    "the production of @xmath0 mesons in @xmath2 collisions is thought to occur predominantly through the excitation ( and de - excitation ) of the @xmath1 resonance , to which the @xmath0 meson couples strongly .",
    "however , the excitation mechanism of this resonance is currently an open issue . for example",
    ", batini et al .",
    "@xcite have found that both @xmath7 and @xmath0 exchanges are the dominant excitation mechanisms .",
    "however , they have considered only the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "fldt and wilkin @xcite and gedalin et al .",
    "@xcite have considered both the @xmath6 and @xmath4 reactions . in the analysis of ref.@xcite",
    "the @xmath5 reaction is also considered .",
    "these authors @xcite find @xmath8 exchange to be the dominant excitation mechanism of the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "in particular , it has been claimed @xcite that @xmath8 meson exchange is important for explaining the observed shape of the angular distribution of the @xmath6 reaction . in an anaylsis of @xmath6 reaction , santra and",
    "jain @xcite also considered @xmath8 meson exchange as the dominant excitation mechanism of the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "in contrast to the findings of refs.@xcite , pea et al .",
    "@xcite have found that the dominant contribution arises , not from the @xmath1 resonance current , but from the shorter range part of the nucleonic currents . in this work",
    ", we shall report on another possible scenario for exciting the @xmath1 resonance that reproduces both the @xmath6 and @xmath4 reactions and discuss the possibility of disentangling these reaction mechanisms .",
    "although we focus here on the problem just mentioned , the description of @xmath0 meson production in @xmath2 collisions presents other interesting aspects .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 meson interacts much more strongly with the nucleon than do mesons like the pion so that not only the @xmath2 final state interaction ( fsi ) , but also the @xmath9 fsi is likely to play an important role , thereby offering an excellent opportunity to learn about the @xmath9 interaction at low energies . in fact , the near - threshold energy dependence of the observed total cross section for @xmath0 meson production differs from that of @xmath7 and @xmath10 production , which follow the energy dependence given simply by the available phase - space together with the @xmath2 fsi .",
    "the enhancement of the measured cross section at small excess energies in @xmath0 production compared to those in @xmath7 and @xmath10 production is generally attributed to the strong attractive @xmath9 fsi .",
    "in addition to all of these issues , the theoretical understanding of @xmath0 meson production in @xmath2 collisions near threshold in free space is also required for investigating the dynamics of the @xmath1 resonance in the nuclear medium , the possible existence of @xmath11 bound states , and the possibility of using @xmath0 to reveal the properties of high - density nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in section",
    "ii we introduce our model and define the meson production currents whose details are given in the appendix .",
    "an alternative model , which is similar to previous works based on @xmath8 exchange dominance , is introduced in section iii .",
    "the results are given in section iv .",
    "section v provides a summary .",
    "our model of the @xmath12 reaction is based on a relativistic meson exchange model of hadronic interactions .",
    "the reaction amplitude is calculated in the distorted wave born approximation . here",
    "we follow a ( non - rigorous but otherwise economic ) diagrammatic approach to present our formulation",
    ". a more rigorous derivation of the reaction amplitude will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we start by considering the meson - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath2 interactions as the building blocks for constructing the total amplitude describing the @xmath14 reaction .",
    "we then consider all possible combinations of these building blocks in a topologically distinct way , with two nucleons in the initial state and two nucleons plus a meson in the final state . in this process of constructing the total amplitude ,",
    "care must be taken in order to avoid diagrams that lead to double counting .",
    "specifically , the diagrams that lead to mass and vertex renormalizations must be excluded since we choose to use the physical masses and coupling constants . the resulting amplitude constructed in this way",
    "is displayed in fig .",
    "the ellipsis indicates those diagrams that are more involved numerically ( including , in particular , the @xmath13 fsi , which otherwise would be generated by solving the three - body faddeev equation ) .",
    "so far there are very few attempts to account for them @xcite .",
    "these higher order terms are also not considered in this work .    in order to make use of the available potential models of @xmath2 scattering",
    ", we will carry out our calculation within a three - dimensional formulation which is deduced from bethe - salpeter formulation by restricting the propagating two nucleons to be on their mass shell .",
    "we follow the procedure of blankenbecler and sugar@xcite .",
    "the meson production amplitude illustrated in fig.1 then takes the following familar form @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath2 @xmath17-matrix interaction in the initial(@xmath18)/final(@xmath19 ) state , and @xmath20 is the three - dimensional blankenbecler - sugar ( bbs ) propagator . the superscript @xmath21 in @xmath16 as well as in @xmath20 in eq.([ampl0 ] ) indicates the boundary condition , @xmath22 for incoming and @xmath23 for outgoing waves .",
    "the production current is denoted by @xmath24 , which is defined by the @xmath13 @xmath17-matrix with one of the meson legs attached to a nucleon ( first diagram on the r.h.s . in fig .",

    "the subscripts 1 and 2 stand for the two interacting nucleons 1 and 2 .",
    "the summation runs over the intermediate meson @xmath31 .",
    "eq.([ampl0 ] ) is the basic formula on which the present calculation is based .",
    "we note@xcite here that care has been taken in the above three - dimensional formulation to avoid double counting problems .    in the near threhold energy region",
    ", the two nucleon energy in the final state @xmath19 is very low and hence the @xmath2 fsi amplitude , @xmath32 in eq.(1 ) , can be calculated from a number of realistic @xmath2 potential models in the literature . in the present work we use the @xmath2 model developed by the bonn group@xcite to calculate the fsi .",
    "this model is defined by a three dimensionally reduced bbs version of the bethe - salpeter equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the bbs two - nucleon propagator , consistent with those appearing in eq.([ampl0 ] ) .",
    "( note that our definition of @xmath35 differs from that of ref.@xcite by a factor of @xmath36 ) .    the @xmath2 initial state interaction ( isi ) amplitude , @xmath37 in eq.([ampl0 ] ) ,",
    "must be calculated at incident beam energies above @xmath38 .",
    "there exists no accurate @xmath2 model for performing such a calculation .",
    "for example , the model developed in ref.@xcite can only give a very qualitative description of the @xmath2 scattering phase shifts at energies above 1 gev .",
    "in the present work we therefore follow ref.@xcite and make the on - shell approximation to evaluate the isi contribution . this amounts to keeping only the @xmath39function part of the green function @xmath40 in evaluating the loop integration involving @xmath41 .",
    "the required on - shell @xmath2 isi amplitude is obtained from ref.@xcite . as has been discussed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "this is a reasonable approximation to the full @xmath2 isi . in this approximation ,",
    "the basic effect of the @xmath2 isi is to reduce the magnitude of the meson production cross section .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see that the angle - integrated production cross section in each partial wave state @xmath18 is reduced by a factor of @xcite @xmath42 ^ 2 \\leq \\frac{1}{4}[1+\\eta_{i}(p)]^2 \\ . \\label{isieff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the phase shift and corresponding inelasticity , respectively ; @xmath45 stands for the relative momentum of the two nucleons in the initial state .",
    "there are a number of different approaches in the literature which model the production current @xmath24 defined in eq.([curr0 ] ) based on meson exchange models .",
    "following refs.@xcite , we split the @xmath13 @xmath17-matrix of fig.1 into the pole ( @xmath46 ) and non - pole ( @xmath47 ) parts and calculate the non - pole part in the born approximation .",
    "then , the @xmath13 @xmath17-matrix can be written as@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 denoting the dressed meson - nucleon - baryon ( @xmath52 ) vertex and baryon propagator , respectively .",
    "the summation runs over the relevant baryons @xmath53 .",
    "the non - pole part of the @xmath17-matrix is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 , with @xmath56 denoting the pole part of the full @xmath13 potential @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath56 is given by equation analogous to eq.([mntp ] ) with the dressed vertices and propagators replaced by the corresponding bare vertices and propagators .",
    "we neglect the second term of eq.(7 ) and hence the full @xmath13 @xmath17-matrix in eq.([curr0 ] ) is approximated as @xmath58 .    with the approximation described above",
    ", the resulting current @xmath24 consists of baryonic and mesonic currents .",
    "the baryonic current is further divided into the nucleonic and nucleon resonance ( @xmath59 ) currents , so that the total current is written as @xmath60 the individual currents are illustrated diagrammatically in fig .",
    "note that they are all feynman diagrams and , as such , they include both the positive- and negative - energy propagation of the intermediate particles .",
    "the nucleonic current is constructed consistently with the @xmath2 potential in the bbs equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the mesonic current consists of the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 exchange contributions .",
    "the resonance current consists of the @xmath1 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 resonances excited via the exchange of @xmath7 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath66 mesons .",
    "details of our model for the production current are given in the appendix .",
    "in order to allow for a close comparison of the model described in the previous section with the models @xcite based on @xmath8 meson exchange dominance , we have also constructed a model in which the @xmath1 is excited through the exchange of vector mesons . for this purpose ,",
    "we follow refs.@xcite to define the vector meson couplings with @xmath1 by using the following lagrangian densites    @xmath67    [ nr12v ]    note that the above @xmath68 coupling , which violates gauge invariance , is rather different from the tensor coupling ( see eqs.([nr12omega],[nr12rho ] ) ) used in our model described in the previous section and detailed in the appendix .",
    "in addition to using the @xmath68 coupling in the @xmath69 vertex ( @xmath70 ) , here we assume the extreme case that @xmath1 is excited exclusively via the exchange of @xmath8 and @xmath66 mesons . furthermore , for simplicity , we neglect all other resonance contributions in the resonance current .",
    "this is a reasonable simplification since we find that the resonance current contributions apart from that due to @xmath1 are very small .",
    "the nucleonic and mesonic currents are identical to the model described in the previous section .",
    "we refer to this model as the vector meson exchange dominance model .",
    "we find that this model can also roughly reproduce the total cross section data by choosing the coupling constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 in eq.([nr12v ] ) .",
    "overall , the values of these coupling constants , including the signs , are consistent with those used in refs.@xcite , in spite of the fact that there the isi and fsi are treated differently from the present work .",
    "we therefore can use this model to investigate the differences between our full model described in section ii and the previous works @xcite based on @xmath8 exchange dominance .",
    "in this section we shall present our results on the @xmath0 meson production in both the @xmath73 and @xmath74 collisions based on the models described in the previous sections .",
    "the parameters of the considered models are given explicitly in the appendix .",
    "in short , the coupling constants and range of form factors for meson - baryon - baryon vertices are chosen to be consistent with the bonn potential in conjunction with the values used in refs.@xcite and the values extracted from particle data group @xcite .",
    "thus in our calculations there is not much freedom for adjusting parameters .",
    "the total cross sections as a function of excess energy predicted by our model ( described in section ii ) are shown in fig .",
    "the full results are the solid curves which are in general in good agreement with both the data of @xmath73(upper panel ) and @xmath74(lower panel ) collisions . for small excess energies ,",
    "our @xmath73 results underestimate the data .",
    "this is usually attributed to the @xmath9 fsi , which is not accounted for in the present model .",
    "note that the results for @xmath4 with excess energy @xmath75 , corresponding to an incident beam energy larger than @xmath76 , should be interpreted with caution , as no reliable @xmath2 phase shift analyses for @xmath77 states exist at present for energies above @xmath76 @xcite . to see the dynamical content of our model",
    ", we also show in fig.3 the results calculated from keeping only nuleonic current(dashed curves ) , mesonic current(dash - dotted curves ) , and resonance current(dotted curves ) .",
    "we see that the total cross sections are obviously dominated by the resonance current , and more specifically by the strong @xmath1 resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "our nucleonic current contributions ( dashed curves ) are much smaller than the resonance current contributions .",
    "this is rather different from the findings of ref.@xcite ; there , instead of the resonance current , the shorter range part of the nucleonic current gives a large contribution to the @xmath78 cross section .",
    "it will be interesting to know whether their model can also give a good description of @xmath79 data , as achieved here(lower panel of fig.3 ) .    to examine the differences between our model and previous work ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the results from calculations including only the @xmath1 resonance(solid curves ) contribution . within our model ,",
    "this resonance excitation is due to the exchange of @xmath7 , @xmath0 , @xmath8 , and @xmath66 . to see the relative importance between these different meson exchange mechanisms",
    ", we also show in fig  [ fig7 ] the results from @xmath7 exchange(dashed curves ) , @xmath0 exchange ( dash - dotted curves ) , and @xmath8 exchange(dotted curves ) .",
    "although the @xmath66 exchange is included in the calculation , its contribution is not shown here separately because it is much smaller than the @xmath8 exchange contribution . as can be seen",
    ", the dominant contribution is due to @xmath7 exchange followed by @xmath0 exchange .",
    "the @xmath8 exchange contribution is very small .",
    "several observations are in order here :    * in contrast to the result of refs.@xcite , our model , as given by eq.([nr12rho ] ) , does not allow the @xmath80 coupling in the @xmath81 vertex for the considered negative parity @xmath1 resonance .",
    "such a coupling would prevent us from determining the @xmath82 coupling from radiative decay @xmath83 in the vector meson dominance model ( vmd ) as explained in the appendix , since it violates the gauge invariance constraint which is an essential element of vmd .",
    "the simplest way of satisfying gauge invariance is to omit the @xmath84 coupling and use only the tensor @xmath85 coupling , as given in eq.([nr12rho ] ) .",
    "this choice of the @xmath81 coupling , combined with the corresponding coupling constant as given in table [ tab1 ] - which is close to the low limit of the range determined from the measured radiative decay widths - leads to a very small @xmath8 exchange contribution to the cross section as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( dotted curves ) .",
    "this is the main origin of the differences between our results and that of refs.@xcite where the @xmath81 vertex for @xmath86 is specified by the @xmath84 coupling ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "an alternative to avoid the gauge invariance problem while keeping the @xmath84 term is to use a vertex of the form @xmath87 $ ] @xcite .",
    "pea et al .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , have used the vertex @xmath88 $ ] in conjunction with the coupling constant determined from a quark model @xcite .",
    "this vertex yields the same meson production amplitude as that of a pure @xmath84 vertex while satisfying the gauge invariance constraint , although only in the on - shell limit ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "they found a significant contribution of @xmath8 exchange to the excitation of @xmath1 in @xmath78 .",
    "further experimental information is needed to determine whether the @xmath84 coupling is required for vector meson exchange .",
    "* the @xmath0 exchange contribution is relatively large in the present calculation . in the case of @xmath6",
    "its contribution to the cross section is about half of that due to the @xmath7 exchange .",
    "the @xmath0 exchange contribution is subject to a relatively large uncertainty which arises , apart from the introduction of the phenomenological form factors , from the uncertainty in the @xmath11 coupling strength as discussed in the appendix .",
    "the relatively large contribution of @xmath0 here results from using the @xmath11 coupling constant of @xmath90 , as used in the construction of the bonn @xmath2 interaction @xcite .",
    "this is close to the upper limit of the range determined empirically as mentioned in the appendix .",
    "however , the @xmath0 meson exchange in the bonn potential @xcite represents the exchange of a @xmath91 quantum number and not necessarily of a genuine @xmath0 meson . on the other hand",
    ", the value of @xmath90 together with the @xmath92 mixing angle of @xmath93 , as suggested by the quadratic mass formula , and the @xmath94 coupling constant of @xmath95 leads through su(3 ) flavor symmetry to the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "this is not too far from the value of @xmath97 extracted from a systematic analysis of semileptonic hyperon decays @xcite .",
    "anyway , in the present calculation for @xmath6 , the @xmath0 exchange interferes constructively with the dominant @xmath7 exchange contribution , yielding the total contribution as shown by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the @xmath0 exchange interferes constructively with the @xmath7 exchange in the @xmath98 channel ( as in the case of @xmath6 ) , but destructively in the @xmath77 channel due to the isospin factor @xmath99 in the @xmath7 exchange amplitude .",
    "* the correct description of both @xmath6 and @xmath4 reactions depends not only on the isospin factors associated with the isovector and isoscalar meson exchange but , also on a delicate interplay between the @xmath2 fsi and isi in each partial wave .",
    "while the @xmath2 fsi enhances the total cross section , the @xmath2 isi has an opposite effect ( see discussion in section ii ) . in this connection",
    ", we mention that in ref.@xcite the reduction factor due to the @xmath2 isi is estimated to be about @xmath100 due to the @xmath101 state and @xmath102 due to @xmath103 . in our calculation , however , the corresponding reduction factors are about @xmath104 and @xmath105 near the threshold energy .",
    "this large discrepancy between the results of ref.@xcite and ours is due to the fact that , whereas our reduction factor is given by eq.([isieff ] ) , the reduction factor in ref.@xcite is given by @xmath106 .",
    "we argue that the latter formula is inappropriate for estimating the effect of the @xmath2 isi since it exhibits a pathological feature : namely , when the absorption is maximum ( @xmath107 ) , this formula yields @xmath108 , implying the total absence of the @xmath2 elastic channel and thus not allowing the production reaction to occur .",
    "however , scattering theory tells us that when the absorption cross section is maximum , the corresponding elastic cross section does not vanish , but is 1/4 of the absorption cross section .",
    "note that this feature is present in eq.([isieff ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the authors of ref.@xcite apparently have identified incorrectly the inelasticity @xmath109 with @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is one of the two parameters ( the other is the phase shift ) given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the phase shift parametrization given in ref.@xcite differs from the standard stapp parametrization .",
    "it is obvious that with a more appropriate estimate of the reduction factor @xmath112 as given by eq.([isieff ] ) the result of ref.@xcite would underpredict considerably the cross section data .",
    "we now turn to exploring the vector meson exchange dominance model described in section iii .",
    "this model does not have the @xmath7 and @xmath0 exchange mechanisms for exciting the @xmath113 resonance .",
    "the nucleonic and mesonic currents of our full model are kept . with the coupling constants",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 in eq.([nr12v ] ) , we can describe both the @xmath114 and @xmath115 data .",
    "the results are the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . in the same figures",
    "we also show the contributions from the nucleon resonance ( dotted curves ) and the nucleonic ( dashed curves ) and mesonic ( dash - dotted curves ) currents .",
    "although the total cross section is underpredicted for excess energies @xmath116 , it is interesting that these results are in line with the findings of refs.@xcite .",
    "the results presented above indicate that the total cross section data alone can not distinguish two different meson exchange mechanisms for the excitation of @xmath1 resonance .",
    "it is therefore necessary to consider more exclusive observables .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the angular distribution(solid curves ) of @xmath6 predicted by our model ( described in section ii ) at an excess energy of @xmath117 . the data from ref.@xcite are also shown .",
    "again , the resonance contribution ( dotted curve ) dominates the cross section .",
    "as pointed out in ref.@xcite , the shape of the angular distribution of the latter contribution bends upwards at the forward and backward angles due to the @xmath7 exchange dominance in the @xmath1 resonance contribution .",
    "however , due to interference with the nucleonic ( dashed ) and mesonic ( dash - dotted ) currents , the shape of the resulting angular distribution ( solid curve ) is inverted with respect to that of the resonance current contribution alone .",
    "as one can see , although the overall magnitude is rather well reproduced , the rather strong angular dependence exhibited by the data is not reproduced by the model described in section ii . at this point",
    "one might argue that the excitation mechanism of the @xmath1 resonance as given by our model is not correct and that , indeed , the @xmath8 meson exchange is the dominant contribution , as has been claimed in ref.@xcite .",
    "this can be studied by considering the predictions of our vector meson exchange dominance model described in section iii . the angular distribution predicted by this model",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . here",
    "we see that the shape of the calculated angular distribution(solid curve ) is in better agreement with the data , although the strong angular dependence exhibited by the data - which shows contributions of higher partial waves than @xmath118 - is not quite reproduced .",
    "judging from the level of agreement between the two predictions and the data , one can not discard our model in which the @xmath1 is mainly excited by @xmath7 and @xmath0 exchange in favor of the @xmath8 exchange dominance model . in this connection",
    ", we mention that new data from cosy which will become available soon shows a flat angular distribution @xcite .    from the above considerations , we conclude that , at present , the excitation mechanism of the @xmath1 resonance in @xmath2 collisions is still an open question .",
    "indeed , we have just offered a scenario which is as good as the @xmath8 exchange dominance model in reproducing the available data .",
    "it is therefore of special interest to seek a way to disentangle these possible scenarios . in this connection ,",
    "spin observables may potentially help resolve this issue .",
    "as an example , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] the analyzing power at @xmath119 ( upper panel ) and @xmath117 ( lower panel ) . the predictions of the present model are shown as the solid curves , whereas the predictions assuming vector meson exchange dominance for exciting the @xmath1 resonance are shown as the dashed curves .",
    "the different features exhibited by the two scenarios for the excitation mechanism of the @xmath1 is evident .",
    "according to ref.@xcite , the @xmath8 exchange contribution is expected to lead to an analyzing power given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is positive for low excess energies , peaking at @xmath122 and becoming negative for excess energies @xmath123 .",
    "the corresponding results are also shown in fig .  [ fig11 ] as the dotted curves .",
    "although eq.([rhoay ] ) gives rise to a larger analyzing power at @xmath124 , it is interesting to see that , at @xmath125 , it yields a result that nearly coincides with the prediction of the vector meson exchange dominance given in section iii .",
    "the production of @xmath0 mesons in @xmath2 collisions has been discussed within a relativistic meson exchange model of hadronic interactions , where the production current has been constructed consistently with the @xmath2 fsi used .",
    "special emphasis has been paid to investigate the possible excitation mechanisms of the @xmath1 resonance , which is currently a subject of debate .",
    "it has been shown that , not only the vector meson dominance for exciting the @xmath1 as advocated by wilkin and collaborators @xcite , but also the excitation mechanism of this resonance mainly via exchange of @xmath7 and @xmath0 mesons can describe the existing data in both the @xmath73 and @xmath74 collisions equally well .",
    "we have found that the analyzing power may offer an opportunity to disentangle these reaction mechanisms .",
    "a consistent description of the meson production reaction in @xmath73 and @xmath74 collisions is not a trivial task .",
    "as we have seen , this depends not only on the different isospin factors in the production current which change the relative importance of different reaction mechanisms from @xmath73 to @xmath74 collisions , but also on a delicate interplay between the @xmath2 fsi and isi .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath126 and @xmath127 as well as the @xmath128 reaction should be investigated in a consistent way .",
    "also more exclusive observables than the total cross section such as the spin observables should be studied .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the results presented in this paper should be interpreted with caution .",
    "the reason for this is that , as mentioned before , the @xmath2 isi is only accounted for using the on - shell approximation . while this may be a reasonable approximation for calculating cross sections , it may introduce rather large uncertainties in the calculated spin observables .",
