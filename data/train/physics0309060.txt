    "continual ( functional ) integrals , or path integrals , introduced to quantum mechanics by r.feynman @xcite , are widely used for constructing series in perturbation theory , for finding quasi - classical asymptotes , for quantizing gauge fields @xcite@xcite .",
    "mathematical questions of the functional integral theory are discussed in @xcite .",
    "path integrals combined with monte - carlo technique are being used for solving problems of quark confinement @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the question of applying path integral approximations to problems of practical computations of quantum system spectra remains virtually unexplored .",
    "first , not very successful , attempts of this kind are described by kac@xcite .",
    "an example of computation for a system of two particles sitting in a potential well is considered in @xcite . among more recent papers it is worth noting the work @xcite , where an estimate for the ground level from below is obtained with a help of path integral .",
    "papers @xcite-@xcite employ `` wick rotation '' and they allow obtaining information only about the ground level , moreover , for some examples considered in @xcite the results disagree with exact values by a factor more than two .",
    "it seems that path integrals were applied for global spectrum analysis in quasi - classical limit only @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it remains unclear if approximations to path integrals can have a practical value for calculations of the schrdinger equation spectra .",
    "to clarify the situation , it seems appropriate to begin with simplest quantum systems and to investigate the influence of the path types and of the order of approximations on the results .",
    "here we suggest the following approach to finding the energy levels @xmath10 of a quantum system with the help of path integrals . the kernel of evolution operator @xmath11 ( i.e. the time - dependent green function ) can be expressed via eigenfunctions @xmath12 of the schrdinger equation : @xmath13 for @xmath3 shifted for an infinitesimal step to the upper half of the complex plane and for @xmath14 , equation ( 1 )",
    "implies : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the green function of a stationary schrdinger equation .    on the other hand , the kernel ( 1 ) can be expressed via the path integral in configuration space @xcite : @xmath17 @xmath18.\\ ] ] here @xmath19 with @xmath20  a segment of a straight line connecting @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while @xmath23 is a broken line with vertices in @xmath24 separated by equal time intervals @xmath25 ; @xmath26 is a lagrangian , and @xmath27^{(n+1)/2}.\\ ] ] subscript @xmath28 in @xmath29 and @xmath30 denotes the type of the path @xmath23 ( feynman ) .    let us define a function @xmath31 , an approximation of the @xmath1-th order to the exact green function @xmath32 : @xmath33    for @xmath34 the real part of @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath35 , tends to a sum of @xmath36-functions in the r.h.s . of ( 2 ) , according to ( 3 ) . for finite @xmath1 ( for a sufficiently good approximation ) the real part @xmath35 must have maxima near exact values of @xmath10 .",
    "we put forward a technique for computations of @xmath31 and carry out them for harmonic and anharmonic oscillators in one- and multi - dimensional cases and in a one - dimensional potential well of a shape @xmath37 .",
    "we find a number of analytical expressions for @xmath38 .",
    "an unexpected result of our numerical experiments is the fact that a `` good '' approximation for finding the values of energy levels ( with accuracy of order 10 per cent ) is @xmath31 already for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the approximations @xmath39 in ( 4 ) can be built based on an arbitrary complete set of functions , not necessarily broken lines .",
    "for example , using an expansion over an orthogonal set of sines one can replace the paths @xmath40 in ( 4 ) by @xmath41 and the factor @xmath30 by @xmath42 the factor @xmath43 is determined from the condition that an approximate expression for the kernel coincide @xmath39 with the exact @xmath44 for all values of @xmath1 in case of a free particle .    for a lagrangian @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being units of energy and length",

    "shifted to the upper semi - plane we have , according to [ 19 ] , @xmath57 here @xmath58 ; @xmath59 is the hankel function of the first kind ; @xmath60\\}^{1/2 } , \\eqno(14)\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "the expression ( 13 ) is valid also as an approximation of the @xmath1-th order of a general green function @xmath63 .",
    "then @xmath64 in ( 10 ) , and functions @xmath65 in ( 12 ) and ( 14 ) depend both on @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a useful tool for searching the levels can also be a spectral function , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the degeneracy of the @xmath68-th level . defining @xmath69 we see that @xmath70 , i.e. the @xmath1-th order approximation to @xmath71 over paths of type @xmath72 is given by the expression @xmath73 this expression differs from ( 13 ) only by raising the order of integration by unity .",
    "maxima of the real part of @xmath70 must lie near the exact energy levels while the height of the maxima must reflect the degree of the level degeneracy .",

    "the exact expression for the kernel @xmath44 of one - dimensional harmonic oscillator is well - known , still it is interesting to consider the behavior of @xmath95 for low orders of approximation .",
    "for @xmath96 it follows from ( 18 ) that , if @xmath7 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 @xmath99    in case of evenly symmetric potentials , @xmath100 , for odd levels , the wavefunctions vanish at @xmath101 , @xmath102 , therefore , according to ( 2 ) maxima of the r.h.s . of expression ( 22 ) must correspond only to even energy levels @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",

    "the exact energy values of even levels are shown by arrows .",
    "one can see that the dependence @xmath108 has clear peaks located in correspondence with the levels of the oscillator .",
    "e.g. , for expansion over sines ( 5s ) the location of the first maximum deviates from the exact value of the ground level by less than 15% .",
    "the behavior of @xmath111 ( which is proportional to @xmath112 ) must reflect the properties of a sum of @xmath36-functions .",
    "the location of a @xmath36-function is determined by an integral relation .",
    "therefore it is more natural to expect that a level corresponds not to a maximum of @xmath111 , but to an average of the integral ( i.e. a median value ) of @xmath111 between two minima of the dependence @xmath111 .",
    "we call this median value a median of the peak , and the area under the curve @xmath112 between two adjacent minima of @xmath111 will be called a weight of the peak .",
    "the median of the ground level peak calculated from ( 22 ) is equal to @xmath113 which differs form the exact value , @xmath114 , by 2% .",
    "for @xmath115 we have from ( 22 ) : @xmath116 , \\eqno(23)\\ ] ] i.e. maxima and medians of the peaks @xmath117 are at @xmath118 , and of @xmath119 at @xmath120 , for large even @xmath68 .",
    "thus , medians of peaks of @xmath119 coincide with exact values of oscillator levels for @xmath115 , while the expansion over broken lines gives a spectrum which is qualitatively correct , but with a relative error @xmath121% ( approximately the same as for the ground level ) .",
    "with account of the coefficient @xmath122 in ( 13 ) , we obtain from ( 22 ) for @xmath109 that the weight of the peak of the ground level is equal to @xmath123 .",
    "this differs from the exact value , @xmath124 , by less than 1% .    in general case :",
    "@xmath125 therefore , we find an asymptotic formula @xmath126 for levels with large number @xmath127 . according to ( 23 ) , for @xmath109 the weights of peaks coincide with this exact value .",
    "for @xmath110 the difference between the peak weight and the exact value @xmath128 is of order @xmath121% .",
    "now let us turn to approximations of the second order ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the results of numerical calculations of @xmath129 and @xmath130 based on the formula ( 20 ) are shown in fig.2 .",
    "for @xmath7 the graphs of @xmath117 and @xmath119 were similar to each other , but now we see a drastic difference in the behavior of @xmath131 .",

    "it is likely that good results obtained with the paths ( 5s ) for @xmath8 are due to the fact that they are optimum for approximations of path integrals over the wiener measure [ 20 , 21 ] . for other potentials , e.g. for a box with reflecting walls ,",
    "the behavior of the function @xmath132 is quite regular ( see below ) and it has no `` false '' maxima .",

    "the relative error for high levels grows from 0% for @xmath158 up to about 10% for @xmath159 when @xmath109 and @xmath7 ; it falls from @xmath16010% down to zero for @xmath134 changing from 2 up to @xmath161 when @xmath110 ( @xmath7 ) .",
