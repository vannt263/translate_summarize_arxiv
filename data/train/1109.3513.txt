    "the nature of dark matter ( dm ) is an important problem in modern physics .",
    "dm plays a key role in the formation of large structures and the evolution of the universe .",
    "it is also widely expected to provide a link to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . for these reasons",
    "much experimental , observational , and theoretical effort has been devoted to shedding light on dm .",
    "it is popular to identify dm with weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "many properties of a wimp are not constrained by our current knowledge of dm , for example the wimp may or may not be a stable particle  @xcite and it may or may not be identified with its antiparticle  @xcite .",
    "asymmetric dm refers to a scenario where the wimp s antiparticle has been annihilated away , leaving the wimp itself as the observed dm .",
    "asymmetric dm candidates were put forward in @xcite as technibaryons , in @xcite as goldstone bosons , and subsequently in many diverse forms @xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of mixed dm  @xcite , i.e.  having both a thermally - produced symmetric component and an asymmetric one .",
    "null results from several experiments , such as cdms  @xcite and xenon10/100  @xcite , have placed stringent constraints on wimp - nucleon cross sections .",
    "interestingly dama  @xcite and cogent  @xcite have both produced evidence for an annual modulation signature for dm , as expected due to the relative motion of the earth with respect to the dm halo .",
    "these results support a light wimp with mass of order a few gev , which offers the attractive possibility of a common mechanism for baryogenesis and dm production . at first glance",
    "it seems that the wimp - nucleon cross sections required by dama and cogent have been excluded by cdms and xenon upon assuming spin - independent interactions between wimps and nuclei ( with protons and neutrons coupling similarly to wimps ) , but a number of resolutions for this puzzle have been proposed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , new results from the cresst - ii experiment report signals of light dm @xcite .",
    "a composite origin of dm is an intriguing possibility given that the bright side of the universe , constituted mostly by nucleons , is also composite .",
    "thus a new strongly - coupled theory could be at the heart of dm . in this work",
    "we investigate , for the first time on the lattice , a technicolor - type extension of the sm expected to naturally yield a light dm candidate , as introduced in @xcite and used in @xcite to reconcile the experimental observations .",
    "asymmetric dm requires at least one complex field with a ( nearly ) conserved abelian quantum number .",
    "it would be exciting if the theory predicting the existence of this state is also directly involved with the breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "therefore a natural candidate is a technicolor model .",
    "most of the states of the theory are much heavier than a few gev , but if there are goldstone bosons not absorbed by the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the sm massive gauge bosons , they become primary candidates for producing a natural hierarchy between the gev and the tev scale .",
    "the minimal technicolor theory that breaks the electroweak symmetry and features a light dm state was constructed first in @xcite .",
    "this theory is @xmath1 technicolor with two dirac flavors , which has global symmetry @xmath2 expected to break to @xmath3 .",
    "five goldstone bosons are generated of which three are eaten by the sm gauge bosons and a complex one ( a techni - diquark which is essentially a technibaryon of this @xmath1 theory ) remains in the spectrum .",
    "this is our candidate for the light asymmetric dm particle .    the walking version of this model , known as ultra minimal walking technicolor ( umt ) , has been constructed in @xcite and it contains , besides the fermions in the fundamental representation , also a dirac fermion in the adjoint . for the present exploratory work , we begin with section iii of @xcite but without the adjoint fermion .",
    "moreover , when implementing our lattice simulations we make two additional modifications : all electroweak interactions are omitted from the lattice simulations because that physics is well - understood by perturbative methods , and explicit technifermion masses are added because lattice simulations with exactly massless fermions are not practical .",
    "the resulting lagrangian is very simple @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two techniquark fields having a common bare mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the field strength , and @xmath9 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the dirac and technicolor indices of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not shown explicitly .",
    "lattice simulations will be used to extrapolate to @xmath10 , and in that limit the lagrangian has a global @xmath2 symmetry corresponding to the four chiral fermion fields @xmath11 for @xmath12 , the @xmath2 symmetry is explicitly broken to a remaining @xmath3 subgroup as follows .",
    "the lagrangian from ( [ lagrangian ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath13 where @xmath14 @xmath15 is the charge conjugation operator acting on dirac indices , and the pauli structure @xmath16 is the standard antisymmetric tensor acting on color indices . under an infinitesimal @xmath2 transformation defined by @xmath17",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangianq ] ) becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the 15 generators of @xmath2 and @xmath20 is a set of 15 constants .",
    "the only generators that leave the lagrangian invariant are those that obey @xmath21 which is precisely the definition of an @xmath3 lie algebra . from this",
    ", it is straightforward to derive the ten @xmath3 generators in a specific representation ; see the appendix of @xcite .",
    "for @xmath10 the lagrangian retains the full @xmath2 symmetry but , by analogy with the @xmath22 theory of qcd , one might expect dynamical symmetry breaking associated with the appearance of a nonzero vacuum expectation value , @xmath23 since this vacuum expectation value has the same structure as the terms containing @xmath7 in the lagrangian , the dynamical breaking would also be @xmath24 . according to noether s theorem ,",
    "the five broken generators would be accompanied by five goldstone bosons .",
    "of course this suggestion of dynamical symmetry breaking must be checked nonperturbatively using first - principles lattice simulations . as reported below ,",
    "we have done so and our lattice simulations provide direct verification of this dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "there have been several previous lattice studies of @xmath1 gauge theory with fermions in the fundamental representation  @xcite , mainly motivated by interest at nonzero chemical potential , but all of these studies relied on the staggered action where the number of fermions is a multiple of 4 .",
    "our minimal technicolor theory requires @xmath25 and thus we use the wilson action instead of staggered fermions .",
    "when studying chiral symmetry breaking scenarios with wilson fermions attention must be paid to the presence , on a lattice , of the unphysical aoki phase . for fixed gauge coupling ,",
    "the aoki phase is entered as the quark mass is reduced .",
    "an analytic discussion of the aoki phase symmetries for this theory is provided in @xcite , and three lattice studies are also available @xcite . for our present simulations ,",
    "we avoid the aoki phase and work exclusively in the physical phase .",
    "there have been very few previous lattice results reported for @xmath1 gauge theory with 2 fundamental fermions @xcite and in each case the primary focus was on a different action ( either @xmath26 or adjoint representation fermions ) .",
    "our work is the first lattice study focused on the mass spectrum of the two - color two - flavor theory , which is the familiar technicolor template .",
    "the creation operator for a meson is the hermitian conjugate of its annihilation operator , and a set of local annihilation operators for mesons is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a chosen dirac structure . in this work",
    "we consider @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 . in lattice simulations ,",
    "meson masses are extracted from the time dependence of correlation functions , for example @xmath33 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where tr@xmath34 $ ] denotes a trace over dirac and color indices and we have dropped the vacuum expectation values for the propagators as explained in appendix [ appendix1 ] .    perhaps surprisingly , local diquark ( i.e.  baryon ) correlation functions provide no new data in this theory . to understand why , notice that the available local diquark operators are @xmath35 ( some operators containing @xmath36 or @xmath37 are identically zero . ) the diquark correlation function is therefore @xmath38\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this can be rewritten by using two properties of the charge conjugation operator : one for a dirac matrix , @xmath39 and the other for the wilson fermion matrix , @xmath40 to arrive at @xmath41 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & c_{\\overline{u}d}^{(\\gamma)}(t_x - t_y)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any choice of @xmath28 .",
    "this conclusion means that a lattice simulation will find numerically - identical correlation functions , and thus identical masses , for the meson and diquark .",
    "we have verified this explicitly in the lattice simulations described below .",
    "notice that the degenerate pairs have equal angular momentum but opposite parities , for example @xmath42 this relationship for @xmath43 has also been mentioned , for example , in @xcite .",
    "we must conclude that the three _ pseudoscalar _ meson goldstone bosons are accompanied by two _",
    "scalar _ diquark goldstone bosons .",
    "this is in contrast to the identification made in @xcite , where it was assumed that all five goldstones would be pseudoscalars . despite this ,",
    "the effective lagrangian in @xcite remains unaltered because all scalar and pseudoscalar particles were retained in that work with the correct assignment with respect to the broken and unbroken generators of the chiral symmetry group and @xmath44 at the underlying operator level with @xmath45 and @xmath46 in @xcite . ] .",
    "now that the five goldstones have been identified , we can define an effective theory wherein those five are the only fields .",
    "indeed , our lattice simulations ( discussed below ) indicate that the non - goldstone scalar / pseudoscalar hadrons are even heavier than the vector mesons , making it quite natural to integrate all non - goldstones out of the effective theory .",
    "the annihilation operators are conveniently collected into a compact form , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a generic name for the @xmath49th particle with dirac structure @xmath28 .",
    "this @xmath50 represents the effective lagrangian couplings for external fields @xmath48 . for the special case of the five goldstone bosons , we sum @xmath49 only over the five broken generators and we must choose @xmath51 .",
    "the result is @xmath52 where the matrix @xmath53 contains the five goldstone bosons ( i.e. the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the scalar diquarks @xmath45 ,",
    "@xmath57 ) : @xmath58 the matrix @xmath53 is closed under @xmath3 transformations : the goldstone bosons form a five - dimensional representation of @xmath3 .",
    "the matrix @xmath53 is also identical to @xmath59 as defined by equation ( 22 ) of @xcite after the non - goldstone fields are removed from @xmath59 .    to summarize , an effective field theory for the five goldstone bosons",
    "is obtained by using the matrix @xmath53 in place of @xmath59 in @xcite .",
    "the three pseudoscalar goldstones ( @xmath60 , @xmath56 ) are responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking , and the two scalar goldstones ( @xmath45 , @xmath57 ) are the dm candidate and its antiparticle .",
    "the standard wilson action , @xmath61 is used for this study of @xmath1 gauge theory with two mass - degenerate fermions in the fundamental representation .",
    "configurations were generated using the hmc algorithm as implemented in the hirep code  @xcite .",
    "a total of 12 ensembles were created , corresponding to six different bare quark masses @xmath62 for each of two different gauge couplings @xmath63 ; see table [ tab : betam0 ] for details .",
    "we note that @xcite also contains some simulations of this theory at @xmath64 and our findings for the pseudoscalar meson mass and pcac quark mass are consistent with that paper . for other parameter choices , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "this annihilation operator is local and summed over all spatial sites to produce a zero - momentum hadron .",

    "pseudoscalar , vector and temporal - axial ( @xmath72 ) correlators are fitted to three states , @xmath73 in ( [ cosh ] ) ; scalar and spatial - axial ( @xmath74 ) correlators use @xmath75 .",
    "statistical uncertainties are produced from each 35-configuration ensemble by creating 150 bootstrap ensembles ( having 35 configurations each ) .",
    "isovector hadrons are sufficient for most topics addressed in this work , but isoscalars are used to study a specific issue .",
    "isoscalar operators require the computation of single - site propagators , i.e.  quark propagators that begin and end on a single lattice site . in practice , to obtain a signal requires an average over many sites , so isoscalar studies are expensive .",
    "improved methods have recently been developed @xcite , but the needs of our present project are fulfilled by a simpler tactic .",
    "we choose our `` most physical '' ensemble ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) and calculate 2048 single - site propagators , that is 64 single - site propagators spread uniformly across each lattice time step .",
    "two additional quantities that can be derived from two - point correlation functions are also valuable for the present work .",
    "one is the pcac quark mass defined by @xmath78 and in practice we can average over time separations satisfying @xmath79 .",

    "as familiar from qcd , the axial ward - takahashi identity incorporates a partially - conserved axial vector current ( pcac ) which defines a renormalized quark mass in terms of the axial current s derivative .",

    "[ fig : gbmass ] . at @xmath64 our entire range of masses satisfies ( [ leadingsqrt ] ) . at @xmath76",
    "our range of mass values is broad enough that the two heaviest quarks show curvature coming from corrections to ( [ leadingsqrt ] ) , and our lightest quark displays a finite - volume correction .",

    "although isoscalar correlation functions bring the major challenge of single - site propagators , we want to consider the specific case of the isoscalar pseudoscalar meson .",
    "our goal is to verify explicitly that this meson is not an additional goldstone particle .     and",
    "@xmath77.,width=642 ]    figure  [ fig : discon ] displays the results .",
    "panel ( a ) is the correlation function for the isovector , i.e.  the quark - connected diagram only .",

    "panel ( b ) is the contribution from the quark - disconnected diagram built from a pair of single - site quark propagators .",
    "panel ( c ) is obtained from the upper two panels according to `` ( c)=(a)-2(b ) '' , where the factor of 2 accounts for @xmath99 plus @xmath100 contributions and the minus sign accounts for anticommuting fermions . in panel",
    "( c ) , data at all timesteps between 7 and 24 are statistically consistent with zero , and time steps near the source at @xmath83 correspond to states much heavier than the goldstones .",
    "thus we see how the quark - disconnected diagrams have canceled the goldstone signal out of the isoscalar .",
    "this is the expected conclusion since the symmetry breaking @xmath24 requires exactly five goldstone bosons .",
    "from many previous studies @xcite the lightest neutral technibaryon has become a classic prototype for asymmetric dm , and @xcite focused on the possibility of that technibaryon being a pseudo - goldstone boson . in this work ,",
    "we have performed lattice simulations of @xmath1 gauge theory with two techniquarks which has been used as a template for the construction of composite light dm models @xcite .",
    "for the first time , we verify the existence of the pseudo - goldstone state to identify with the composite dm candidate .",
    "in fact , besides the standard three goldstone bosons , to be eaten up by the sm gauge bosons , we observe two more goldstone technibaryons .",
    "these latter states are scalars rather than pseudoscalars .",
    "the masses of other phenomenologically relevant technihadrons were found to be an order of magnitude heavier than the goldstone decay constant , thus justifying the construction of an effective field theory containing only the five goldstone fields introduced in @xcite and then adapted to umt in @xcite .",
    "we have established the expected pattern of chiral symmetry breaking in the absence of the electroweak interactions . typically these interactions tend to destabilize the vacuum ( see @xcite for a recent study ) which can be , however , re - stabilized when extending the technicolor theory to give masses to the sm fermions and to the otherwise massless dm candidate",
    ".    one might ask whether a light isoscalar scalar meson is present in this gauge theory , reminiscent of the @xmath101 meson of qcd , that could be viewed as a composite higgs boson .",
    "the isoscalar scalar channel is a major challenge for lattice simulations @xcite , and we must leave this question to be the focus of a future study",
    ".    in the future it will be very interesting to determine more accurately the mass spectrum of the theory , but there are many additional topics waiting to be explored as well . here",
    "we mention three of them .",
    "the effects of _ four - fermion interactions _",
    ", relevant for a realistic extension of the sm , should be investigated @xcite .",
    "the extension to _ nonzero temperature _ would lead to a characterization of the early universe electroweak phase transition .",
    "knowledge of its order and strength is essential for investigating the possibility of providing correct baryon and asymmetric dm genesis at the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "the _ nonzero matter density _ regime is also useful for asymmetric dm physics @xcite given that an asymmetry implies the presence of a nonzero chemical potential .",
    "in contrast to qcd , the extension to nonzero matter density is directly possible in lattice simulations of this @xmath1 theory .",
    "that is because the fermions belong to a pseudoreal representation of the @xmath1 gauge group and therefore a chemical potential does not lead to an imaginary action . at nonzero matter density a number of interesting phases can emerge , such as baryon superfluidity ( due to the condensation of the diquark technibaryon ) and rotational invariance breaking ( due to spin - one condensates @xcite arising from lorentz symmetry breaking at nonzero chemical potential ) .",
