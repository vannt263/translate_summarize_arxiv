    "phase transitions between different nonequilibrium steady states are frequently encountered in nature , and determining the associated critical properties is an important issue .",
    "unfortunately , compared with the situation in thermal equilibrium , a full classification of nonequilibrium phase transitions is still in its infancy .",
    "we shall focus here on a particular subclass of nonequilibrium transitions which separate an ` active ' phase , characterized by a fluctuating order parameter @xmath0 with nonzero average @xmath1 , from an absorbing state wherein @xmath2 . in the thermodynamic limit , all degrees of freedom remain strictly frozen in such an inactive , absorbing phase @xcite .",
    "the universality classes of such transitions are conveniently studied in the framework of reaction - diffusion processes , even though other descriptions abound ( surface growth , self - organized criticality ) @xcite .",
    "the most prominent representative of absorbing state transitions is the _ contact process _",
    "( cp ) , for under quite generic conditions , namely spatially and temporally _ local _ microscopic dynamics , and the absence of coupling to other slow fields ( thus excluding quenched disorder and the presence of conservation laws ) , active to absorbing state transitions fall into the cp universality class with scaling exponents that also describe critical _ directed percolation _ ( dp ) clusters @xcite . yet ,",
    "the very fact that despite considerable effort hardly any experiments have to date unambiguously identified the cp / dp critical exponents , hints at the prevalence of other universality classes . in simulations ,",
    "the ` _ parity - conserving _ ' ( pc ) universality class is also prominent : represented by one - dimensional branching and annihilating random walks ( baw ) @xmath3 , @xmath4 with _ even _",
    "@xmath5 , it is characterized by _",
    "local _ particle number parity conservation .",
    "in contrast , the phase transition in low - dimensional baw with _ odd _",
    "@xmath5 is governed by dp exponents @xcite .",
    "novel critical behavior is to be expected when _ all _ involved reactions require the presence of neighboring particle pairs @xcite .",
    "the _ pair contact process with diffusion _",
    "( pcpd , or _",
    "annihilation / fission _ model @xcite ) is conveniently defined through the microscopic reaction rules @xmath6 ( the presence of either pair annihilation @xmath7 or coagulation @xmath8 suffices ) , supplemented with particle hopping ( diffusion constant @xmath9 ) subject to mutual exclusion .",
    "the latter is crucial for the existence of a well - defined active phase and continuous transition . for without restrictions on the occupation number per lattice site , the particle density diverges within a finite time when @xmath10 @xcite . in the inactive phase , however , site exclusion should not be relevant .",
    "it is then easily seen that the absorbing state of the pcpd ( as in the pc universality class @xcite ) is governed by the _ algebraic _ density decay of the pure pair annihilation process @xcite , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath11 in dimensions @xmath12 , @xmath13 for @xmath14 , and @xmath15 at the ( upper ) critical dimension @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , in the cp / dp universality class , the inactive phase is characterized by _ exponential _ particle decay and correlations .",
    "recall that here the branching processes merely require the presence of a single particle : the third reaction in ( [ reactionrules ] ) would simply be replaced with @xmath17 .",
    "site exclusion is not crucial in this case , as long as the pair annihilation or coagulation reactions are included .",
    "alternatively , the combined first - order reactions @xmath18 and @xmath17 _ with _ site exclusion yield a cp / dp continuous phase transition as well .    holding the rates @xmath19 and @xmath20 fixed",
    ", there is a critical production rate @xmath21 at which the transition between the active nonequilibrium steady state and the absorbing phase occurs .",
    "it is a central issue , in an effort to classify nonequilibrium phase transitions , to clarify the precise manner in which the particle production mechanism defines the properties of both the absorbing state and the universality class of the transition , _",
    "i.e. _ , how it affects scaling properties in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "numerical investigations of the pcpd started with ref .",
    "it almost constitutes an euphemism to state that this and the subsequent flurry of numerical work @xcite@xcite have revealed conflicting views ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive overview ) : for not only are the precise numerical values of the critical exponents still being debated to this day , but even more striking , the very issue of the pcpd universality class has remained controversial .",
    "essentially three scenarios have been put forward : either the transition defines a novel independent universality class that is yet to be characterized , or it belongs to the cp / dp , or even to the pc class ( the latter perhaps becoming less likely with improving simulation accuracy ) .",
    "in addition , the emergence of different scaling properties depending on the value of the diffusion rate has been claimed .",
    "this inconclusive numerical situation clearly calls for analytical approaches to provide further understanding of the elusive continuous phase transition of the pcpd with restricted particle occupation numbers .",
    "a natural starting point is the standard field - theoretic representation of reaction - diffusion systems that can be derived directly from the corresponding classical master equation @xcite . specifically , dynamical renormalization group ( rg ) studies based on such ` microscopic ' field theories were , _",
    "e.g. _ , successfully employed to diffusion - limited annihilation @xcite and even - offspring baw @xcite , as well as the inactive phase of the pcpd without site occupation restrictions @xcite . in either case , particle _",
    "anti_correlations govern the asymptotic scaling regime , as opposed to the typical clustering behavior in the cp / dp universality class ( that includes odd - offspring baw ) @xcite . here",
    "another coarse - graining step takes the original ` microscopic ' master equation representation to reggeon field theory , equivalent to a langevin equation with ` square - root ' multiplicative noise , that serves as the appropriate _ effective _",
    "action for the cp / dp critical properties .",
    "thus , one would hope that the continuous nonequilibrium phase transition in the pcpd with restricted site occupations should be amenable to these powerful tools as well .",

    "[ rgflo ] .",
    "we will demonstrate that there exists in fact _ no _ stable rg fixed point in the physically accessible parameter space of the model ( wherein all reaction rates are non - negative ) .",
    "remarkably therefore , the microscopic field theory , albeit directly derived from the master equation , is _ not _ capable of capturing the pcpd critical point .",
    "we interpret the appearance of runaway flows as an indication that a crucial ingredient was obviously left out when the ( naive ) continuum limit was taken @xcite .",
    "an appropriate effective coarse - grained description might require the explicit introduction of separate density fields for the ` inert ' solitary random walkers and the clustered particles , respectively , akin to the explicit treatment of particle pairs and singlets in ref .",

    "the construction of a consistent field theory description of the pcpd remains an open problem .",
    "similar issues arise also for the closely related models that involve solely particle triplet or quadruplet reactions @xcite .",
    "the classical master equation kinetics of particles subject to diffusion and local ` chemical ' reactions can be mapped onto a field theory action following standard procedures @xcite . however , for the density to remain bounded in the processes ( [ reactionrules ] ) at arbitrary values of the reaction rates , specifically in the active phase , it is necessary to introduce a growth - limiting process . in most numerical simulations",

    "where @xmath195 , this would immediately contradict the positivity of the left - hand side .",
    "consequently , the previously found scaling exponents which satisfy @xmath196 ( exactly ) are definitely inacceptable .",
    "this is in remarkable contrast to the results obtained for the pure pair annihilation or coagulation process @xcite , where the density and the integrated cumulant obey identical asymptotic scaling behavior , @xmath197 .",
    "hence no contradiction arises here provided @xmath198 . neither are particle anticorrelations necessarily excluded at critical points : for even - offspring baw that represent the pc universality class , a one - loop rg analysis at fixed dimension yields @xmath199 and @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath201 in dimensions @xmath202 , which is precisely the borderline dimension ( within the one - loop approximation ) for the existence of the phase transition and the power - law inactive phase in this system .",
    "we have investigated the ` microscopic ' field theory for the pcpd , as derived directly from the defining master equation , by means of the dynamic renormalization group .",
    "although fluctuations generate an infinite chain of particle production processes @xmath203 , the theory remains controlled and renormalizable in the inactive phase @xcite , where it is governed by the fixed point of the pure annihilation / coagulation model @xcite .",
    "this is most elegantly seen by means of a functional rg approach @xcite . in order to render the particle density finite in the active phase ,",
    "we have incorporated site occupation restrictions following the methods developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the mean - field level , this indeed leads to a continuous transition separating the active from the absorbing phase .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of the rg flow equations shows that the action ( [ shifaction ] ) does _ not _ adequately capture the critical properties of the pcpd : ( i ) there is no stable rg fixed point in the physical region of parameter space , and instead one obtains runaway trajectories ; ( ii ) the scaling exponents found at the rg fixed point in the unphysical regime violate the positivity of the mean - square particle number fluctuations .",
    "we emphasize that these statements in fact hold to _ all _ orders of the perturbation expansion and even apply to the nonperturbative ` exact ' rg approach .",
    "this failure really resides in the starting field theory action itself , not its subsequent evaluation .",
    "obviously , a crucial ingredient was left out when the ` naive ' continuum limit was performed .",
    "we can only speculate as to what the potential remedies might be , in part motivated by pictures from simulation studies , where positive particle correlations are observed both at the critical point and in the active phase : perhaps one needs to explicitly introduce separate fields respectively for the positively correlated clustered particles and the solitary random walkers as coupled slow variables .",
    "the challenge then , however , is to write down a consistent coarse - grained field theory that correctly accounts for the internal stochastic noise generated by the reactions . to date",
    ", therefore , an apt field theory description of the pcpd remains an open and difficult problem .",
    "finally , we remark that the same problems arise with the master equation field theory when the pcpd order parameter is coupled to a static , conserved background field @xcite .",
    "the above statements also apply to active - to - absorbing transitions in related higher - order reactions @xcite . for purely triplet reactions ,",
    "@xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) and @xmath206 one readily derives a field theory representation corresponding to the action ( [ shifaction ] ) , essentially just raising the powers of @xmath207 by one in the nonlinear vertices . in the inactive phase",

    "one would obtain a slower critical decay @xmath210 .",
    "but once again , the critical fixed point can not be reached by the rg flow starting at physical parameter values . moreover ,",
    "the presence of a redundant parameter even questions the validity of identifying @xmath211 as the critical dimension .",
    "likewise , the expectation that in general fourth - order processes are merely described by mean - field scaling exponents may not be borne out by a correct treatment .",
