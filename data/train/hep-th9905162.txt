    "summing up all together , we conclude that in the weak coupling limit , for the fluctuations along the longitudinal directions the boundary conditions are neumann - type , as expected from the worldsheet picture .    due to the change of the frequency parameter @xmath62 in the differential equation ,",

    "calculating the transmitting amplitude , the total power emanated from the end of the attached string @xcite is now @xmath82 times the ordinary flux @xmath83 .",

    "this unsatisfactory result may be interpreted in the following way .",
    "( [ curl ] ) indicates that the vanishing of the rotation of @xmath116 , which is a necessary condition for the integrability , occurs when the solution is bps ( @xmath112 ) , or , when there is no uniform electric field ( @xmath136 ) . as for the bps limit",
    ", it is known that the bps solution of the ordinary maxwell - scalar system is actually the solution of fully ( higher derivative ) corrected effective equations of motion of open strings @xcite .",
