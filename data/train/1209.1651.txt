    "for the second subset of generators it is enough to take @xmath101 with rank of @xmath46 exactly @xmath28 , since @xmath101 with @xmath46 of smaller ranks are already included in the first subset of generators .",
    "note that the projective orlik - solomon ideal @xmath63 is generated as an abelian group just by the @xmath124 for dependent @xmath46 .",
    "indeed , note that @xmath125 .",
    "but from the lemma [ lemma : leibnitz ] if @xmath126 we can write @xmath127 , with all @xmath128 dependent sets . on the other hand @xmath129 means @xmath130 , where every @xmath131 is an extension by one element of some dependent @xmath46 , and hence is also dependent .",
    "first we argue that for any rank @xmath28 flat @xmath45 we have @xmath133 . indeed , according to lemma [ lemma : leibnitz ] and the first remark after it we just have to show that @xmath134 for @xmath131 of size @xmath118 and rank @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath135 or @xmath136 , we are done .",
    "otherwise , say @xmath137 .",
    "but @xmath139 must have rank @xmath140 ( or , otherwise @xmath135 ) , hence is dependent .",
    "thus @xmath141 is in @xmath142 , and so is @xmath143 .",
    "consequently , @xmath144 .    to show the converse we notice that each @xmath46 is contained in a unique flat of the same rank ( the matroidal closure of @xmath46 ) .",
    "we group the terms in an element @xmath145 by their flats : @xmath146 where @xmath147 contains terms @xmath59 with dependent @xmath46 .    now if @xmath148 for some rank @xmath28 flat @xmath45 , then in the above decomposition @xmath149 .",
    "also all @xmath150 with @xmath151 , are in @xmath142 , and hence so is @xmath152 . but all terms @xmath59 in @xmath142 with independent @xmath102 have to come from @xmath153 for some dependent @xmath154 .",
    "thus @xmath155 .",
    "taking the intersection over all @xmath28-flats completes the proof .",
    "taking the intersection in lemma [ lemma : osk ] is orthogonal to taking the sum in lemma [ lemma : fk ] .",
    "thus it is enough to prove the statement in the top degree for any matroid . by dualizing the top degree part of lemma [ lemma : leibnitz ] it suffices then to show that @xmath156 , where the @xmath46 run over independent @xmath32-sets of @xmath0 and @xmath157 is the adjoint operator to @xmath158 .    for any complete flag of flats",
    "@xmath159 the polyvector @xmath160 contains only terms with independent @xmath46 .",
    "thus @xmath161 .",
    "we will show the converse by induction on the rank of @xmath0 . for rank 1 matroids",
    "both spaces are @xmath162 and there is nothing to prove .",
    "suppose now @xmath163 , with all @xmath131 independent .",
    "we may choose a representation for @xmath164 with all @xmath46 independent subsets as follows .",
    "substituting , say , @xmath165 mod @xmath47 into @xmath166 we will have @xmath167 and any term @xmath43 with dependent @xmath46 in @xmath166 will result in @xmath168 in @xmath169 with dependent @xmath170 which can not happen .",
    "let @xmath171 be all rank @xmath172 flats in @xmath0 .",
    "we again group the terms in @xmath166 by the respective flats @xmath173 . then writing @xmath174 we note that both @xmath169 and the second summand contain terms @xmath43 only with independent @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "each @xmath175 contains terms of rank @xmath176 , and there no cancellations possible among different @xmath28 .",
    "thus @xmath177 . by exactness of the @xmath178-operator",
    "we can write each @xmath179 as @xmath180 and use the induction assumption .    with the choice of the dual bases for @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath52 the restriction to @xmath60 in @xmath52 is exactly dual to the quotient by @xmath47 in @xmath34 , and the duality extends to the exterior algebras . on the other hand",
    ", the identification in theorem [ lemma : os ] clearly extends to the level of graded ideals @xmath181 , as well as to their restrictions to @xmath182 .",
    "this note was meant to serve as an appendix to our ( long overdue ) joint project on tropical homology @xcite with ilia itenberg , ludmil katzarkov and grisha mikhalkin .",
    "but since a shorter geometric argument will appear in the realizable case in @xcite ( all that is needed there ) the algebraic proof given here makes now more sense as an independent article . of course , numerous discussions with all three coauthors were crucial for the formulation and the proof of the main statement .",
    "i am very grateful to them for their permission to publish the result as a separate paper .",
    "i would also like to thank federico ardila for several very helpful conversations .",
    "he is primerily responsible for my current appreciation of matroids .",
    "finally i should mention that another inductive proof of theorem [ thm : os ] was recently given by kristin shaw in her thesis @xcite using tropical modifications ."
