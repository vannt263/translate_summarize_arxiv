    "there has recently been growing evidence that soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are the same population of the ultra - strongly magnetized neutron star ( @xmath0 g ) , so called `` magnetar '' ( duncan & thompson 1992 ; harding & lai 2006 ) .",
    "activities in these objects are powered by the dissipation of strong magnetic fields unlike rotation - powered pulsars and accretion - powered x - ray binaries .",
    "both sgrs and axps generally undergo the quiescent phase with persistent x - ray emission and the recurrent phase of soft gamma - ray ( mereghetti et al .",
    "typical luminosities at these two phases are @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath3@xmath4 respectively ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ; woods & thompson 2006 ) .    besides the common short burst",
    ", the giant flare with enormous energy and long bursting duration is exceptionally observed from sgrs .",
    "these are the most energetic galactic event currently known ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) .",
    "only three of giant flares have been observed : sgr0526 - 66 on 1979 march 5 ( mazets et al . 1979 ) ,",
    "sgr1900 + 14 on 1998 august 27 ( hurley et al . 1999 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1999 ; feroci et al .",
    "2001 ; tanaka et al .",
    "2007 ) , and sgr1806 - 20 on 2004 december 27 ( hurley et al . 2005 ; palmer et al . 2005 ; terasawa et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the giant flare from sgr1806 - 20 is the most recent and energetic one .",
    "it is characterized by an ultra - luminous hard spike , with energy @xmath7 , lasting @xmath8 , which decays rapidly into a soft pulsating tail lasting hundreds of second .",
    "the spectrum of the hard spike is fitted by the blackbody radiation with the temperature @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , a preflare activity with the total energy @xmath10 and the duration @xmath11 is detected @xmath12 before the main burst .",
    "it also shows the single blackbody spectrum with the temperature @xmath13 ( boggs et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the exceptional event observed in association with the giant flare from sgr1806 - 20 is an expanding radio emitting ejecta ( taylor et al . 2005 ; cameron et al .",
    "2005 ; gaensler et al.2005 ) .",
    "the emission properties are well resolved by the synchrotron radiation from the shocked baryonic shell with the mass @xmath14 and the expansion velocity @xmath15 if it is roughly spherical ( gelfand et al . 2005 ; granot et al .",
    "however , the origin of the baryon - load of the ejecta remains unsettled although it is essential for promoting better understanding of flaring activities on magnetars ( see thompson & duncan 1995 , hereafter td95 ; gelfand et al . 2005 ; lyutikov 2006 ) .    in these situations , the solar flare gives an important prototype context for the astrophysical flaring activity .",
    "it is well known that solar flares are also accompanied by analogous mass ejection events , that is called `` coronal mass ejections ( cme ) '' .",
    "the physical properties of the solar flare / cme are very similar to those of the magnetar flare ( lyutikov 2006 ) .",
    "specifically , the initial spike and subsequent tail emissions associated with magnetar flares are naturally reminiscent of impulsive and decay phases of solar flares . in this paper",
    ", we construct a theoretical model for the magnetar giant flare on the basis of the solar flare / cme model .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . the magnetic reconnection model , which is the underlying theory of the solar flare / cme , is applied to the magnetar system for providing a physical basis of our magnetar model in   2 .",
    "in   3 , we propose a theoretical model describing the magnetar giant flare according to a promising solar flare / cme scenario . in   4 , we discuss the effectiveness of the assumptions used in our model and the baryonic evaporation process in the microscopic viewpoint .",
    "finally , we summarize the characteristics of our model in   5 .",
    "magnetic reconnection is believed to be a crucial mechanism of the energy release in the solar flare ( parker 1963 ; petschek 1964 ) . the observational evidence , such as cusp - shaped soft x - ray loops and hard x - ray sources above the loops , supports this model that predicts the primary site of the energy release above the soft x - ray loops ( tsuneta et al .",
    "1992 ; masuda et al .",
    "the discovery of escaping plasmoids from the flare sites is another evidence for this model because it predicts the ejection of plasma from the reconnection region ( shibata et al .",
    "1995 ; ohyama & shibata 1997 ) .",
    "the released magnetic energy triggered by the magnetic reconnection is converted to the thermal energy in the magnetosphere and then the heat conduction drives the evaporation of chromospheric plasma .",
    "the discoveries of blue - shifted component of spectral lines and moving plasma in x - ray images , confirm the upward motion of the ablated plasma anticipated from the chromospheric evaporation theory ( feldman et al . 1980 ; culhane et al .",
    "1992 ; doschek et al .",
    "1992 ; savy 1997 ) .",
    "shibata & yokoyama ( 1999 ; hereafter sy99 ) propose a magnetic reconnection model of the solar flare taking account of the chromospheric evaporation .",
    "they point out that the flare temperature is determined by the counterbalance between the reconnection heating and the conductive cooling . the coronal density is then controlled by the evaporation cooling of the chromospheric plasma which compensates for the conductive heating ( see also , shimojo et al .",
    "2001 ; miyagoshi & yokoyama 2003 ) .",
    "the scaling relation obtained from the magnetic reconnection model can explain the observed correlation between the emission measure @xmath16 and the flare temperature @xmath17 from solar micro - flares to proto - stellar flares consistently ( feldman et al .",
    "1995 ; yokoyama & shibata 1998 , 2001 ; aschwanden et al .",
    "this suggests that the underlying physics of the flare would be common to various astrophysical systems .",
    "we apply the magnetic reconnection model to the mysterious magnetar system for providing the physical basis of the flaring activity .",
    "we consider a situation in which enormous magnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere is released through a flare induced by the magnetic reconnection .",
    "then a lot of magnetic arcade loops are formed on magnetar surface . here",
    "the reconnected single flare loop is schematically illustrated in figure  [ fig1]a .",
    "figure  [ fig1]b focuses on a reconnection site to clearly specify the energy conversion process .    at first",
    ", we provide a physical process that controls the typical energy liberated by magnetar flares . when we follow a classical magnetic reconnection model ,",
    "the energy release rate of a flare can be described using the released magnetic energy flux @xmath18 @xmath19 ( priest & forbes 2002 ) where @xmath20 is the released energy by a flare , and @xmath21 is the area of the reconnection site .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig1]b , the magnetic reconnection can liberate the magnetic energy which is equivalent to that inflows into the reconnection site .",
    "given the magnetic energy density @xmath22 and the inflow velocity @xmath23 , the magnetic energy flux @xmath18 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "if we consider only a single flare loop , the area of reconnection site would be given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the the height of the reconnection point and @xmath28 is the width of the single flare loop ( see fig .  [",
    "however , we now suppose that there are formed a lot of magnetic arcade loops on the magnetar surface .",
    "hence for taking account of the contribution from all magnetic loops , we adopt @xmath29 as the total area of all reconnection sites , where @xmath30 is the size of the active region sustaining flaring activities .",
    "we fix the typical size @xmath30 as @xmath31 cm in the following .    since the reconnection timescale is evaluated as @xmath32 , equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath33 where the approximation @xmath34 is used for obtaining this equation .",
    "based on the classical magnetic reconnection theory , the field strength @xmath25 and the reconnection height @xmath27 mainly controls the magnetic energy liberated by the flare .      in the case of the solar flare ,",
    "the flare temperature @xmath17 is determined by the conductive cooling which balances with the reconnection heating ( sy99 ) . however , the radiative cooling dominates the conductive one in the physical condition realized in the magnetar flare ( see   4.3 in detail ) .",
    "the temperature in the flaring state of the magnetar is thus mainly controlled by the radiative cooling which compensates for the reconnection heating .",
    "additionally , we should take account of the heat absorption due to the pair creation which would impact on the thermal balance of the magnetar system especially in the higher temperature regime @xmath35 k. considering that the blackbody cooling and the heat absorption due to the pair creation become predominate in various cooling processes , the thermal balancing equation gives @xmath36 \\;.",

    "note that @xmath42 represents the radiative energy due to the blackbody cooling and @xmath43 shows the endothermic energy due to the pair creation .",
    "the magnetic effects on the thermal equilibrium are expected to be vanishingly small and ignored here because the configuration of post - flare loops would not be changed by post - reconnection processes .",
    "we focus on the system with @xmath44 and @xmath45 which are suitable conditions for describing the flaring activity of the magnetar ( boggs et al .",
    "2007 ) . assuming the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) , in the range @xmath46 and @xmath47",

    "coupled with the equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , we can derive the flare temperature as a function of four physical parameters , @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "once the solar flare begins , the released energy is rapidly transported to the top of the chromosphere by the electron heat conduction and heats the chromospheric plasma suddenly .",
    "then the pressure of the heated plasma increases drastically and drives the upward flow into the magnetic loop . a hot post - flare loop , which is filled by the evaporated dense plasma , should be formed finally ( hirayama 1974 ; sylwester 1996 ; sy99 ) .",
    "it can be anticipated to operate a similar baryonic evaporation process in the magnetar flare ( see liu et al .",
    "2002 for an application of chromospheric evaporation process to accretion disks ) .    in the magnetar flare",
    ", the photon flux plays a crucial role in the heat transport unlike the solar flare dominated by the electron heat conduction .",
    "this is because the mean free path of the electron is very short and it thermalizes instantaneously in the magnetar s magnetosphere .",
    "even if the energy is transported by the created electron - positron pair , the evaporation eventually occurs since the thermal equilibrium should be established by the photon flux after the pair beams are thermalized .",
    "the incident energy flux , which inflows into the crustal surface , should thus counterbalance with the outgoing enthalpy flux of the evaporation flow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "when we consider the contribution from the created electron positron pair during the flare , the number density of the baryon in the evaporation flow @xmath54 is provided by the balancing equation ; @xmath55 ( c.f . , sy99 ) where @xmath56 is the inflowing downward energy flux , @xmath57 is the upward velocity of the evaporation flow , @xmath58 is the specific enthalpy of composite gas of the baryon and the equilibrium radiation field , and @xmath59 is that of the created electron positron pair .",
    "notice that this equation is equivalent to the energy conservation equation for a mass conserving steady system with the composite gas and the created electron positron pair ( c.f .",
    ", mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) .",
    "assuming the thermal equilibrium state , the specific enthalpy of the composite gas @xmath58 is @xmath60 ( mihalas & mihalas 1984 ) where @xmath54 is the number density of the baryon loaded in the evaporation flow , and @xmath61 is the ratio of radiation and gas pressures .",
    "the specific enthalpy of the electron positron pair @xmath59 is additionally given by @xmath62 where @xmath41 is the pair density given by equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the upward velocity of the evaporation flow @xmath57 can be replaced by the sound speed of the composite gas @xmath63 , according to the chromospheric evaporation theory of the sun ( sy99 ; shimojo et al .",

    "we thus find from the equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) that the baryon density of the evaporation flow is the function of @xmath20 , @xmath25 , @xmath30 , @xmath37 since the flare temperature is given by @xmath66 .",
    "note that it is not settled whether the significant downward energy flux can be maintained after the radiation and pair energy density sufficiently grows at the surface in the realistic magnetar situation .",
    "we naively assume here that it is sustained as long as the flaring activity lasts .",
    "the duration sustaining the strong downward photon flux will be investigated in our future numerical work .      for given parameters @xmath20 , @xmath25 , @xmath30 and @xmath37",
    ", we can obtain @xmath17 , @xmath57 , @xmath61 , @xmath41 and @xmath54 by iteratively solving the coupled equations  ( [ eq4])([eq11 ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig2]a shows the flare temperature @xmath17 , number densities of the evaporated baryon @xmath54 and the created electron positron pair @xmath71 as a function of an arbitrary parameter @xmath20 in the case with the fixed flare duration @xmath72 .",
    "the each variables are normalized by their typical values",
    ".    as is expected , all physical variables increase with increasing the flare energy .",
    "notice that the growth rate of the flare temperature is slightly reduced in the high energy range @xmath73 by the cooling effect due to the pair creation .",
    "however , the baryon density steadily increases because the enthalpy of the created pair is negligible compared with that of the baryon in the range of interest .",
    "the mass of the evaporated baryon @xmath67 , the evaporation velocity @xmath57 , the ratio of radiation and gas pressures @xmath74 , and the ratio of energy densities for the electron positron pair and the radiation field @xmath75 are demonstrated as a function of the flare temperature @xmath17 @xmath76 $ ] respectively in figure  [ fig2]b .",
    "the flare duration is fixed as @xmath72 again .",
    "it is found from this figure that the ratio of energy densities @xmath75 increases with the increase of the flare temperature , and reaches to unity around @xmath77 k. this indicates that the pair production cooling partially contributes to the thermal balance of the system in the range @xmath78 k.    furthermore , the ratio of the radiation and gas pressures @xmath61 slightly decreases in the high temperature range .",
    "this is because the increasing rate of the radiation pressure is suppressed due to the pair creation although the gas pressure increases steadily when @xmath79 k. the apparent enhancement of the growth rate for the baryonic mass @xmath67 reflects the reduction of the temperature increasing rate due to the pair production cooling .",
    "we finally depict the evaporated baryonic mass @xmath67 in figure  [ fig3 ] as a function of the flare temperature @xmath17 in the cases with different flare durations @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "we find that the evaporated baryonic mass is definitely larger in the case with longer flare duration .",
    "the characteristics of curves are almost same in three models .",
    "numerical results indicate that the pair production effect does not dramatically change the qualitative features of our model in the temperature range @xmath78k .",
    "we can thus neglect the contributions from the radiation field and the created pair plasma in the evaporation process described by equation  ( [ eq6 ] ) . since the thermal balance of the system can be also retained only by the blackbody cooling in equation  ( [ eq4 ] )",
    ", we can analytically derive the flare temperature and the evaporated baryonic mass using scaling relations , @xmath83 and @xmath84 these can be used only when the flare energy @xmath85 and the flare temperature @xmath86k .",
    "a promising solar flare / cme scenario , which is strongly supported by observational and theoretical studies ( e.g. , priest & forbes 2002 ; shibata 2005 ) , indicates that the baryonic material loaded in the cme is evaporated from the sub - coronal chromospheric region before its erupting stage .",
    "the evaporated matter is then trapped in the coronal region and held in the mechanical equilibrium retained by the balance between the magnetic tension and magnetic pressure forces . the cme event is finally driven by the magnetic pressure force after the loss of equilibrium which is caused by the dissipation of the magnetic tension via the magnetic reconnection .",
    "the cme induces large - scale field reconfigurations and triggers the main bursting activity as the final outcome .",
    "according to the solar flare / cme scenario , we propose a model describing magnetar giant flares on the basis of the underlying magnetic reconnection theory constructed in ",
    "our model consists of the following four stages which are illustrated in figure  [ fig4 ] schematically .",
    "a flaring activity begins from preflare stage . in this stage , the magnetic energy stored in the magnetar s magnetosphere",
    "is partially liberated by the magnetic reconnection ( fig  [ fig4]a ) .",
    "supposing that the typical height of the reconnection point is relatively low and is given by an order of @xmath87 , the released energy and the temperature characterizing the preflare , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , are evaluated from equations  ( [ eq3 ] ) and  ( [ eq12 ] ) , @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the field strength , the flare duration , the size of the active region , and the reconnection height in units of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 respectively ( c.f . , boggs et al .",
    "( b ) . during the preflare activity",
    ", the radiative heat flux transports the released energy and heats the crustal sub - surface matter .",
    "the pressure of the crustal matter then increases drastically and drives the upward evaporation flow . as the result ,",
    "a hot and dense prominence , which is trapped by the post - flare loops , is builded up ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "the mass of the prominence @xmath99 is comparable to that of baryonic matters evaporated and is given by equation  ( [ eq13 ] ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the normalized preflare temperature @xmath102 [ see the typical preflare temperature in eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) ] .    immediately after the preflare stage",
    ", the formed prominence is bound to the lower magnetosphere of the height @xmath103 cm gravitationally , while the reconnection point where the preflare is triggered is an order of @xmath104 cm [ see eq.(14 ) ] .",
    "this is because the potential energy of the evaporated matter becomes restricted by the input radiative energy ( liberated magnetic energy ) .",
    "after the preflare stage , the prominence is gradually lifted up by the magnetic energy injected from the magnetar s interior during quiescent stage ( see   4.1 for details of the prominence uplifting process ) .",
    "the system evolves with retaining a quasi - force - free equilibrium by counterbalancing the magnetic tension with the magnetic pressure .",
    "the prominence is finally erupted by the magnetic pressure force after the loss of equilibrium which is caused by the dissipation of the magnetic tension via the magnetic reconnection .",
    "the prominence eruption induces large - scale field reconfigurations and triggers a giant burst as the final outcome ( fig  [ fig4]c ) .",
    "supposing the reconnection height for liberating numerous magnetic energy at the main burst stage to be @xmath105 , the energy and temperature of the giant burst @xmath106 and @xmath107 are , from equations  ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( c.f . , hurley et al . 2005 ; terasawa et al .",
    "( d ) . the released energy at the main burst stage should be converted into the kinetic energy of the erupted prominence and the radiative energy of the remained flare loops .",
    "the ejected baryon - rich prominence , accelerated by the main burst , would be observed as an expanding ejecta ( fig  [ fig4]d ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that the baryonic matter loaded in the ejecta is supplied by the evaporation at the preflare stage , that is @xmath111 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed value of the baryon load in the radio emitting ejecta in association with the giant flare from sgr1806 - 20 ( c.f .",
    ", gelfand et al . 2005 ; granot et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the remained flare loops are , in contrast , polluted again by the baryonic matter evaporated by the main burst .",

    "( [ eq18 ] ) ] .    as will be discussed in  4.2 , the evaporated baryonic matter at the main bust stage",

    "our solar - type magnetic reconnection model is accountable for the flaring activity associated with the giant flare on 2004 december 27 from sgr 1806 - 20 consistently .",
    "an important prediction from our model is that the preflare activity plays a crucial role in supplying the baryonic matter into the potential ejecta `` prominence '' .",
    "this suggests that the radio afterglow is expected to be observed only after the giant flare with preflare activities , such as the giant burst of sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "we would like to stress that the mechanism for baryonic eruptions proposed in our model is magnetic pressure - driven one which is caused by the loss of equilibrium triggered by the magnetic reconnection .",
    "the preflare - induced mass evaporation plays a role in supplying the baryonic matter into the magnetospheric region .",
    "the mass ejecting mechanism in our model is thus essentially different from the magnetic tension - driven model via slingshot like process proposed by gelfand et al .",
    "we discuss a possible physical mechanism for uplifting the prominence during the quiescent stage in the magnetar system . in our model",
    ", we suppose that the magnetic energy required for uplifting the prominence is supplied from the magnetar s interior via the crustal cracking by the lorentz force like as the model proposed by lyutikov ( 2006 ) .",
    "this is because the dipole field of the magnetar is strong enough to deform the neutron star crust .    during the quiescent stage ,",
    "the crustal surface would be deformed by the lorentz force and the magnetic energy stored in the magnetar s interior is converted to the motional energy of the crust .",
    "the crustal deformation induces the twisting of magnetic fields attached to the magnetar surface and generates helical field components .",
    "the magnetic energy and flux injected into the magnetosphere then re - configure the magnetospheric field .",
    "the evaporated baryonic matter ( @xmath117 prominence ) , which is gravitationally bound to the magnetar surface just after the preflare stage , would be lifted upwardly in association with the field reconfiguration in the magnetosphere .    according to lyutikov ( 2006 ) ,",
    "when we consider a crustal plate of size @xmath30 rotating under the influence of the lorentz force , balanced by viscous stress at the base of the curst , the dissipated energy by the crustal cracking can be evaluated as @xmath118}$ ] , where @xmath119 is the density normalized by @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the rotation period of the deep crustal plate ( landau & lifshitz 1975 ) .",
    "note that the dissipation energy depends on the rotation period of the crustal plate @xmath122 .",
    "although the relation between the typical deformation time @xmath122 of the deep crust and the duration of the quiescent stage is not settled clearly yet , the crustal cracking by the lorentz force should be a promising mechanism , which is alternative to the buoyant flux emergence in the case of the sun , for supplying the magnetic energy into the magnetosphere .",
    "the process for lifting the prominence remains largely speculative .",
    "it is our future work to clarify the physical process for triggering the prominence eruption in the magnetar system . for verifying the validity of our model ,",

    "we finally discuss the baryonic evaporation from the microscopic view point . in our model ,",
    "the baryonic material is supposed to be heated by collisions between incident high - energy photons and the crustal matter .",
    "considering that the ions are located in the center of wigner - seitz cell of the crust , the total internal energy per nuclei is naively given by the sum of coulomb lattice energy @xmath148 and thermal energy @xmath149 @xmath150 ( e.g. , shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) where @xmath151 is the atomic number normalized by that of iron , @xmath152 is the normalized crustal density , and @xmath153 k is the normalized crustal temperature . since the lattice energy becomes predominant in the dense crustal surface , the total number of the evaporating nuclei @xmath154 should satisfy the following equation ; @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the traveling depth of the incident photon through the magnetar crust , and @xmath157 is the depth from the magnetar surface .",
    "the hydrostatic balance between the surface gravity @xmath158 and the pressure gradient force of a degenerate relativistic fermi gas in the strong magnetic field @xmath159 ( td95 , appendix a ) gives @xmath160 and leads to the density distribution of the crust , using the approximation @xmath161 , @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the depth from the magnetar surface normalized by @xmath104 cm .",
    "substituting the equation  ( [ eq35 ] ) into ( [ eq34 ] ) , we can obtain the traveling depth of the photon through the crust ; @xmath164 the amount of the surface material heated by the collision between the high - energy photon and the crustal matter is , therefore , @xmath165 this is consistent with the value of equation  ( [ eq16 ] ) which is derived from the macroscopic view point in the framework of the solar - type magnetic reconnection model .",
    "microscopic evaporation model would also support our magnetar flare model constructed in   2 and 3 .",
    "here we assume naively that all the released radiative energy is spent only for exciting ions , not for increasing their thermal and potential energies .",
    "actually , it is not the easy task to clearly specify how the released radiative energy is distributed to each energy components during the complicated flaring activity . if we follow the energy equipartition law , a fraction of the released energy can be spent for exciting ions at least , and is enough for evaporating the baryonic matter with the mass @xmath166 g. in order to draw a physical picture for the energy distribution process more precisely , we need further study on the nature of strongly magnetized crystal ( harding & lai 2006 ) .",
    "we would like to stress that the magnetic field stronger than @xmath167 g can modify structure of crystal of ions ( e.g. harding & lai 2006 ; hansel et al .",
    "the binding energy of crystal in strong magnetic fields becomes different from that in weak fields .",
    "however , the structure of crystal in strong fields has not yet been studied well ( see however , usov et al .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to construct a theoretical model for the magnetar s flaring activity from the macroscopic view point on the basis of the solar flare / cme model , not to establish a microscopic basis for our model .",
    "thus , in this study , we give rough order - estimation of binding energy of crystal using a simple `` wigner - seits '' model in equation  ( 33 ) .",
    "according to the magnetic reconnection model which can correctly capture the solar flare / coronal mass ejection event , we propose a theoretical model for magnetar giant flares .",
    "it is highly suggestive that our model is accountable for the flaring activity associated with the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 consistently .",
    "our main findings and characteristics of our model are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the temperature of the magnetar flare is essentially determined by the radiative cooling which compensates for the reconnection heating . the cooling effect due to",
    "the pair production partially contributes the thermal balance of the system , but is not significant .",
    "since the blackbody cooling retains the thermal balance of the system , the flare temperature can be given by a simple scaling relation @xmath168 .",
    "\\2 . during the flaring activity",
    ", the photon flux transports the released energy and heats the magnetar crust .",
    "then the pressure of the crustal matter increases drastically and drives the evaporation flow .",
    "the incident radiative heat flux balances with the outgoing enthalpy flux of the evaporation flow . neglecting the enthalpy contribution from the electron positron pair and the radiation field ,",
    "the mass of the evaporated baryon can be represented by a scaling relation @xmath169 .",
    "\\3 . in our model ,",
    "the preflare activity plays a role in supplying the baryonic matter into the magnetar s magnetosphere .",
    "the `` prominence '' which contains preflare - supplied baryonic matters is gradually uplifted via the energy injection from the magnetar s interior with maintaining a quasi - force - free equilibrium of the magnetosphere .",
    "finally the prominence is erupted by the magnetic pressure force due to the loss of the equilibrium triggered by the magnetic reconnection at the main burst stage .",
    "the giant flare should be induced as the final outcome by the prominence eruption accompanied by large - scale field reconfigurations .",
    "our model predicts that the preflare activity produces a baryon - rich prominence .",
    "then the erupted prominence is the origin of the observed radio - emitting ejecta associated with the giant flare from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "in contrast , the post - flare loop formed in the main burst stage is polluted by dense baryonic matters and be trapped to the magnetar surface",
    ". this should be the origin of trapped fireball which causes the ultra - luminas @xmath116-ray spike and the pulsating x - ray tail in the extraordinary flare observed from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
