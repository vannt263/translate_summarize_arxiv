    "this exceptional event triggered observations at x  ray energies with _ integral _ ( pian et al .",

    "these detected the source up to 200 kev and in a brightened high energy state ( pian et al .",
    "this strong optical and hard x  ray activity was followed by a radio outburst with about one year delay ( villata et al .",
    "2007 ) .    after a period of relative quiescence , the blazar underwent again an optical outburst in july 2007 ,",
    "although preliminary optical observationskani/1m / index.html ] suggest a peak lower than that of 2005 .",
    "the alert quickly spread all around the world and triggered observations with _ swift _ and _ agile _ ( tavani et al .",
    "although the latter is still performing its verification phase , it was able to repoint towards the blazar on july 2430 , 2007 and to detect it ( bulgarelli et al .",

    "agile _ during the first part of monitoring , @xmath5 ph @xmath6 s@xmath7 at @xmath8100 mev ( vercellone et al .",
    "2007 ) , is a bit less than 3 times the maximum [ @xmath9  ph  @xmath6  s@xmath7 ] and about 6 times greater than the average [ @xmath11  ph  @xmath6  s@xmath7 ] flux observed by egret ( nandikotkur et al .",
    "2007 ) .    here",
    "we report about the analysis and assembling of the simultaneous optical to @xmath2rays sed of 3c  @xmath12 in order to model this sed and test new ideas about how to obtain dramatic flux changes in specific bands without changing much the power carried by the jet , as detailed in the next section .",
    "we use @xmath13 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "during the huge multiwavelength flare observed in spring 2005 the optical flux increased by almost two orders of magnitude , while the x  ray flux increased by a factor @xmath1610 with respect to the 2000 level detected by _",
    "beppo_sax ( tavecchio et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we can ask if this behavior corresponds to similar changes in the power carried by the jet or if , instead , the jet power is nearly constant , yet able to produce dramatic changes in specific energy bands .",
    "pian et al . (",
    "2006 ) could indeed describe the observed seds in 2000 and 2005 with minimal changes in the bolometric luminosity ( and in the jet power ) , assuming that the dissipation region ( where most of the radiation is produced ) was inside the broad line region ( blr ) in 2000 , and outside it in spring 2005 .",
    "if the magnetic field is the same in the two epochs , despite the difference in the size of the emitting regions , then the power output is dominated by the inverse compton scattering of the broad line photons in 2000 ( external compton , ec ) , and by synchrotron and synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) emission in 2005 .",
    "then katarzynski & ghisellini ( 2007 ) proposed an alternative model , in which the location of the dissipation region varies along the jet , and there is a link between this location , the compactness of the source , and the value of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath17 .",
    "the smaller this distance , the smaller @xmath17 , the larger the magnetic field of the source .",
    "the physical bases of this model were i ) the realization that the power lost in radiation must be a small fraction of the jet power , which has to carry most of it to the radio lobe regions ( at least for powerful blazars ) ; therefore ii ) the kinetic and poynting power of the jet are likely conserved , implying that the magnetic field @xmath18 , where @xmath4 is the ( transverse ) size of the jet ; iii ) in the internal shock model for blazars the dissipation is due to the collision of two shells moving with different @xmath17 : the collision occurs at a distance which is a factor @xmath19 larger than the initial shell separation .",
    "this introduces a link between compactness of the source and @xmath17 ; iv ) even if the dissipation is not due to internal shocks , we may have a similar relation between @xmath17 and compactness if the jet is still accelerating when dissipation occurs . following these ideas , katarzynski & ghisellini ( 2007 )",
    "could reproduce the 2000 and 2005 states of 3c 454.3 with a jet of exactly the same power , by assuming different @xmath17 ( 11 in 2000 and 6.25 in spring 2005 ) . in this model",
    "the observed bolometric luminosity is nearly constant ( except for extreme changes in @xmath17 , resulting in extreme changes of the doppler factor and thus in the doppler boosting of the observed radiation ) .",
    "when dissipation occurs with large @xmath17 the seed external photons are seen largely boosted , while the @xmath20field is relatively weaker , resulting in a ec dominated spectrum , where most of the power is emitted the mev ",
    "gev band . on the other hand , for smaller @xmath17 ,",
    "the @xmath20field is larger , the external radiation is seen less boosted , resulting in a synchrotron and ssc dominated spectrum , with much less contribution of the ec .",
    "it is therefore clear that the main diagnostics of this model is the level of the mev  gev flux during flares : if both the optical ( synchrotron ) emission _ and _ the mev ",
    "gev ( ec ) emission increase , then this flags a real increase of the jet power , but if the increase of the mev  gev flux corresponds to the same ( or even to a fainter ) optical flux , then this flags an emission episode by a jet of nearly constant power but larger @xmath17 .",
    "versa , if the mev ",
    "gev radiation decreases during an optical flare , this flags a jet of constant power dissipating closer to the black hole and with a smaller @xmath17 .",
    "we hope that these simple trends will be verified in the era of simultaneous _ glast _ and _ swift _ observations , able to look for the crucial part of the sed ( optical to gev bands ) . but anticipations of this , for the brightest blazars , are possible using _ agile _ and _ swift _ observations .",
    "this is exactly what happened for 3c 454.3 in july 2007 .",
    "although swift observed 3c 454.3 several times in july and august 2007 , we analysed data from the only observation simultaneous with _ agile _ ,",
    "i.e. that performed on july 26 . the data from the three instruments onboard _ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) have been processed and analysed with ` heasoft v. 6.3.1 ` with the caldb release of july 30 , 2007",
    ".    data from the x  ray telescope xrt ( @xmath21  kev , burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) were analysed using the ` xrtpipeline ` task , set for the photon counting mode and having selected single to quadruple pixel events ( grades @xmath22 ) .",
    "the output data were rebinned in order to have at least 30 counts per energy bin .",
    "the final spectrum is best fitted ( @xmath23 for 43 degrees of freedom ) with a power law with absorption in excess of the galactic value ( @xmath24  @xmath6 , kalberla et al . 2005 ) .",
    "formally , this additional @xmath25 at @xmath3 has a value of @xmath26  @xmath6 .",
    "the power law has a photon index of @xmath27 and a flux of @xmath28  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath7 in the @xmath29 kev energy band",
    ".    the additional @xmath25 may be not physical , but it is used to fit satisfactorily the observed deficit of photons at low energies .",
    "a fit with a broken power ",
    "law model gives multiple minima for the low energy photon index , making it impossible to constrain efficiently the parameters .",
    "the photon deficit at low energies has a gradual decrease , resembling a low  energy cutoff , and the additional absorption is the best statistical way to mimic it .",
    "therefore , when in the following we refer to the unabsorbed x  ray spectrum , we mean the spectrum corrected _ only _ for the galactic absorption .",
    "data from the uv telescope uvot ( roming et al .",
    "2005 ) were analysed by using the ` uvotmaghist ` task with a source region of @xmath30 , while the background was extracted from a source  free circular region with radius equal to @xmath31 ( it was not possible to use an annular region , because of a nearby source ) .",
    "we added a @xmath32 error in flux ( corresponding to about 0.1 magnitudes ) to take into account systematic effects .",
    "the observed magnitudes are @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .    instead , for the hard x  ray detector bat ( optimised for the @xmath36 kev energy band , barthelmy et al . 2005 ) , it is necessary to perform long exposure observations in order to get useful signal from extragalactic sources .",
    "therefore , data from all the july observations ( performed on days 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 20 , 26 , 28 , 30 ) were binned , cleaned from hot pixels and background , and deconvolved .",
    "the intensity images were then integrated by using the variance as weighting factor and the total exposure was 15 ks .",
    "the flux upper limits for a @xmath37 detection  already corrected for systematics",
    " measured at the position of 3c 454.3 are @xmath38  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath7 ( 28 mcrab ) and @xmath39  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath7 ( 38 mcrab ) in the 2040 kev and 40100 kev energy bands , respectively .",
    "-2.3 true cm -0.5 true cm",
    "we adopt a simple , one  zone , homogeneous synchrotron and inverse compton model to the different states of 3c 454.3 .",
    "the model is fully described in ghisellini , celotti & costamante ( 2002 ) , and we briefly outline here the general assumptions .    the source is a cylinder of cross sectional radius @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the distance from the apex of the jet , assumed to be a cone of semiaperture angle @xmath42 .",
    "the width @xmath43 , as measured in the comoving frame , is assumed to be within the range @xmath44 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath20 is homogeneous and tangled ; the blob moves with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath17 and the viewing angle is @xmath45 .",
    "the external radiation is produced at a fixed radius , that can be identified with the radius @xmath46 of the broad line region ( blr ; sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) , reprocessing @xmath1610% of the disk luminosity .",
    "this is likely an approximation of the real amount of external radiation , since , besides the contribution of the blr , other processes can contribute ( scattering by ionised intercloud plasma , synchrotron radiation `` mirrored '' by the clouds and/or the walls of the jet , ghisellini & madau 1996 , and also direct radiation from the accretion disk , dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; celotti , ghisellini & fabian , 2007 ) .",
    "the particle distribution is the result of injection ( for a finite time , taken to be equal to @xmath47 in the comoving frame ) and cooling .",
    "we calculate the random lorentz factor @xmath48 at which the particles cool in one light crossing time .",
    "if the particles are injected between @xmath49 and @xmath50 with a power law distribution of slope @xmath51 , in the `` fast cooling '' regime ( @xmath52 ) , we have @xmath53 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 , ( where @xmath54 is the injection slope increased by one unit ) and @xmath55 between @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in the models presented here ,",
    "this is always the case , since @xmath48 is of order unity in all cases .",
    "based on the above assumptions , the sed modelling yields the results shown in fig .",

    "swift _ and _ agile _ , together with an optical point ( in the @xmath4 band ) taken during the multiwavelength campaign of this source by the tuorla observatory .",
    "the input parameters used for these models are listed in the upper part of tab . [ para ] . in the lower part",
    "we report the derived doppler factor @xmath56 $ ] and the power carried by the jet in the form of magnetic field ( @xmath57 ) , cold protons ( @xmath58 , relativistic electrons ( @xmath59 ) , and produced radiation ( @xmath60 ) , defined as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the magnetic and the radiation energy density measured in the comoving frame , respectively , and where we have assumed one proton per relativistic electron .",
    "the choice of the parameters is not unique in ssc+ec models , especially when the high energy ( @xmath2ray ) peak is not observed , as in 2005 .",
    "the adopted choice reflects the following considerations : i ) we have used the low optical state in 2000 ( top panel ) to fix the contribution of the accretion disk luminosity ; ii ) we have tried to minimise the total power budget ; iii ) we have tried to describe the different states of the source with a minimal change of the power carried by the jet .",
    "we find that the july 2007 flare and the state in 2000 can be reproduced by very similar parameters ( same radius and bulk lorentz factors , slightly different magnetic field and shape of the particle distribution ) , the main difference being the amount of injected power ( @xmath64 going from @xmath65 to @xmath66 erg s@xmath67 .",
    "for the two states in 2005 , instead , the sed can be reproduced by a more compact source , with a smaller @xmath17 , corresponding to a smaller doppler factor @xmath68 .",
    "the magnetic field is greater ( @xmath6935 g ) , and the injected power is slightly greater than for the 2007 state .",
    "the model can reproduce the huge variations observed especially in the optical ( between 2000 and 2005 there is a difference of a factor @xmath16100 ) and in the @xmath2ray band ( the 2007 state is one order of magnitude larger than in 2000 ) .",
    "this is achieved with much smaller variations of the power transported by the jet , as discussed below .",
    "note that in all cases the emission drops above 50100 gev .",
    "this is due to the robust limit to the maximum emitted @xmath2ray energy provided by the decrease of the klein ",
    "nishina cross section .",
    "the maximum energy can be estimated to be @xmath70 gev , where @xmath71 is the frequency of the target soft photons ( as seen in the observer frame ) in units of @xmath72 hz .",
    "internal ( i.e. inside the source ) photon  photon absorption , instead , plays no role in the models presented here .",
    ".for all models we have assumed a viewing angle @xmath73 and a bolometric luminosity of the accretion disk @xmath74 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the 10% of the disk luminosity is reprocessed by the blr and re  emitted as broad lines at a distance @xmath75 cm for all models .",

    "our modelling of the sed of 3c 454.3 in 2000 , 2005 and 2007 is in qualitative agreement with the expectations of the jet radiation model proposed by katarzynski & ghisellini ( 2007 ) , where the relative importance of the synchrotron and ssc luminosity ( with respect to the ec one ) is controlled by the value of @xmath17 , which is associated with the compactness of the source .",
    "the relation between @xmath17 and source compactness relies either on the assumption that the jet is still accelerating when it dissipates , or on the assumption that the dissipation is the result of internal shocks between two shells ( spada et al .",
    "2001 ) , occurring at a distance @xmath78 times the initial separation : in both cases we have that emitting regions with smaller @xmath17 are closer to the black hole , and thus more compact .",
    "the magnetic field would be stronger , implying larger synchrotron and ssc luminosities with respect to the ec one .",
    "it is then possible to have dramatic variations in specific frequency bands even for jets carrying the same amount of power .",
    "indeed , the power in bulk motion of the relativistic electrons ( see tab . [ para ] ) varies no more than a factor 6.3 for the 4 different states we have considered , while the poynting flux varies merely by a factor 3 .",
    "the largest change of the jet power is due to the proton component ( factor 8.6 ) , assuming that there is , for all states , one proton per relativistic electron , and that the electron distribution extends down to @xmath79 .",
    "the latter assumption is usually very difficult to test , since low energy electrons emit synchrotron radiation in the self  absorbed regime ( which is both insensitive to the low  energy cutoff and practically impossible to observe ) and ssc radiation at relatively low frequencies , where the flux is dominated by the synchrotron emission of electrons of higher energies .",
    "the best opportunity to see the radiation emitted by electrons of low @xmath2 is thus when the ssc contribution is not contributing much to the emission in the x  ray band , which is instead dominated by ec radiation .",
    "in fact in this band the ec is produced by low energy electrons .",
    "this is the case for the 2000 and 2007 states of 3c 454.3 .",
    "[ gmin ] shows the predicted spectrum varying @xmath80 from 1 to 3 .",
    "it shows that even tiny variations have a large effect on the spectrum , which becomes much harder than observed when @xmath81 .",
    "we then conclude that the electron distribution _ must _ extend down to @xmath82 .",
    "consider now the value of @xmath60 in comparison with the other powers .",
    "it is of the order of , but in some case larger , than @xmath59 and @xmath83 .",
    "this shows that the power spent by the jet to produce the radiation we see can not be provided by the magnetic field or by relativistic electrons only .",
    "there must be another form of power , able to re  furnish the electrons of the energy lost for producing the radiation .",
    "the simplest possibility is that the jet is baryon loaded , and that @xmath84 dominates the jet power . in our case ( assuming one proton per electron ) we can estimate the radiative efficiency ( i.e. @xmath85 ) which is between 4 and 12 per cent .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the idea that the jet _ must _ be radiatively inefficient , since it has to carry most of its power to the radio lobes ( see also celotti & ghisellini 2007 ) .    finally , we can see where the different states of 3c 454.3 are located in the plane @xmath86@xmath87 , where @xmath86 is the random lorentz factor of the electrons emitting at the two peaks of the sed , and @xmath88 is the radiation+magnetic energy density as seen in the comoving frame .    in this plane",
    "blazars form a well defined sequence ( see ghisellini et al . 1998 ; 2002 ) : low power bl lacs follow a relation @xmath89 and more powerful blazars ( fsrq with broad emission lines ) tend to lie on a @xmath90 relation . as fig .",
    "[ gbu ] shows , the 4 states of 3c 454.3 considered here are somewhat scattered , but they are within the total scatter of the relation in this high @xmath87 , small @xmath86 part .",
    "note also that in this plane the 2000 and 2007 states ( of strong @xmath2ray flux ) are identical .",
    "we can conclude that the july 2007 flare of 3c 454.3 gives support to the idea that dissipation site in relativistic jets changes , and that it is likely that , when it is located closer to the black hole , the emitting region is more compact , has a smaller bulk lorentz factor , and a greater magnetic field , although the power in poynting flux needs not to change , since a larger @xmath20field is compensated by a smaller size and bulk lorentz factor , making @xmath83 nearly constant .",
    "observationally , these characteristics translate in dramatic variations of the synchrotron peak flux and of the ec high energy component , and in an inverse correlation between the synchrotron and ec components .",
    "the more compact the source is , the more intense its synchrotron flux , at the expenses of the ec emission .",
    "the latter becomes fainter for the weaker doppler boosting of the external seed photons in the comoving frame , due to the smaller bulk lorentz factor .",
    "the flux variations at high energies are however mitigated by the ssc emission , which is enhanced for more compact emission regions .",
    "this component can dominate in the x  ray band , and can be recognized by a softer and more intense x  ray spectrum with respect to the spectrum due to the ec process . since in this case the production of high energy @xmath2rays is reduced , the pair production process , due to photon ",
    "photon interactions , is reduced also , and we can evade the problem of the reprocessing of high energy @xmath2ray luminosity into the x  ray band , which inhibits the production of gev radiation in too compact sources . if different states are indeed related to different compactness of the source , one might also expect different variability timescales . however ( and unfortunately ) this is mitigated by the different doppler factors , which are smaller for more compact emitting regions , resulting ( see table 1 ) in minimum variability timescales @xmath77 that are almost equal .",

    "<S> in july 2007 , the blazar 3c 454.3 underwent a flare in the optical , reaching @xmath0 on july 19 . </S>",
    "<S> then the optical flux decreased by one magnitude , being @xmath1 when the source was detected by the @xmath2ray satellite _ agile _ , that observed the source on july 2430 . at the same time , the _ swift _ satellite performed a series of snapshots . </S>",
    "<S> we can construct the simultaneous spectral energy distribution using optical , uv , x  ray and @xmath2ray data . </S>",
    "<S> these shows that an increased @xmath2ray flux is accompanied by a weaker optical / x  ray flux with respect to the flare observed in the spring 2005 by _ integral _ and _ swift_. this confirms earlier suggestions about the behaviour of the jet of 3c 454.3 .    </S>",
