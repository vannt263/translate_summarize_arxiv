    "the electron spin resonance ( esr ) technique offers a unique microscopic probe of carriers in semiconductors with unpaired spins .",
    "it measures transitions between the quantum levels @xmath0 in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the transition between two quantum levels constitutes a @xmath1-function provided there is no external interference with the quantum levels of the spin system .",
    "however , the quantum states of carrier spins undergo a variety of interactions with the environment .",
    "this interaction destroys the @xmath1-functional form of the spectrum and broadens it .",
    "the broadening of the esr signal is a result of two fundamentally different contributions from the medium .",
    "the first is a decay of the quantum levels caused by interaction with the excitations of the environment .",
    "this mechanism leads to the lorentzian shape of the spectral line .",
    "the second contribution is a result of the inhomogeneities of the medium .",
    "one example is the interaction with nuclear spins that is known as hyperfine interaction ; here the inhomogeneities are caused by the probability distribution of the nuclear spin moments . in this case",
    "the spectroscopic signal is the sum of the contributions from spin systems located in different surroundings .",
    "the energy of signal in every surrounding is shifted by the local magnetic field depending on the environment so that the summed signal has an inhomogeneous shape .    as an example ,",
    "electronic spin of cationic pentacene molecule isolated in a solution exhibits inhomogeneous broadening of the esr signal that arises because of hyperfine coupling with 14 proton nuclear spins . the signal is constituted of a series of individual lines due to the hyperfine splitting .",
    "the envelope function of the signal is roughly reproduced by a gaussian @xcite .",
    "this feature is consequence of the central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "the local magnetic field for each electronic spin is caused by interaction with 14 proton nuclear spins and the random energy shifts of respective esr signals are inevitably spread in accordance with gaussian distributions , as a result of the independent nature of respective nuclear spin orientations .",
    "we note that the anisotropic values of @xmath2-factors are averaged out ( or narrowed motionally ) by the rotation motion of the molecules in solution .",
    "in contrast , solid - state organic molecular crystals exhibit esr spectra composed of individual lines that are broadened due to the faster decay rate . then , there might be the case that the individual lines have to become unresolved and the resulting esr spectrum has to be very close to gaussian envelope .",
    "recent major developments in the field of organic thin - film transistors ( tfts ) allow high - precision field - induced esr measurement ( which is referred in the following simply as esr ) for the carriers in semiconductor crystals or films composed of regularly aligned organic molecules . in the measurements , carries are doped without introducing any randomness by using the field - induced technique .",
    "the esr signal in organic tfts was first measured and analyzed in the groundbreaking study by marumoto and his coauthors @xcite . the esr signal observed in pentacene tft at room temperature appeared to be narrower than that observed in solution .",
    "the authors claimed that the narrower linewidth should be an evidence of a spatial extension of wavefunction . according to clt",
    ", the linewidth of a signal coming from charge distribution covering @xmath3 molecules is narrower by the factor @xmath4 .",
    "then , assuming that the signal is gaussian it was concluded that the wavefunction is spread over @xmath5 molecules .",
    "however , we note that the analyses were performed on the esr spectrum with non - gaussian lineshape .",
    "subsequent studies have shown that the field - induced esr signal and linewidth is temperature dependent @xcite .",
    "typical pentacene tfts and rubrene single - crystal transistors exhibit sharp esr signal whose single - lorentzian linewidth presents motional narrowing @xcite effects with increase of the temperature . in case of the pentacene tfts , the feature is well consistent with the thermally activated multiple trap - and - release ( mtr ) transport with the activation energy of about 10 mev in the high temperature range . in contrast , the narrowing effect by the increase of temperature is not observed below around 50 k. actually it was demonstrated by the continuous wave saturation experiments that all carriers in the pentacene tfts are localized at @xmath6k and all relaxation channels are frozen at such low temperatures @xcite .",
    "however the esr spectrum is still deviated from the simple gaussian at low enough temperature .",
    "therefore , the deviation of the esr signal from gaussian shape is not a result of relaxation or motional narrowing but should be associated with the nature of weakly - localized carrier states in the organic tfts .",
    "it is of current important theoretical and experimental challenges in materials physics to understand the carrier transport of organic electronics devices , as they permit productions of large - area and flexible electronic products @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze the situation when the esr signal of a semiconducting organic molecular system is a smooth curve that deviates from the gaussian linewidth even at very low temperatures where the carriers are localized . here",
    "we assume that peculiar lineshape is caused by a further specific inhomogeneity of the pentacene tfts , as associated with the distribution of weakly - localized carrier states which are responsible for the device operation . given this assumption ,",
    "we have developed a unique technique for obtaining the trap density of states from a few to tens of mevs in pentacene tfts @xcite the algorithm of which is described in detail in this paper .",
    "note that the obtained energy resolution for the trap density of states is much higher than that by other methods based on transport or optical measurement @xcite .",
    "the mathematical method suggested here is rather general and can be applied to analyses of broad spectrum in a variety of problems outside of those considered here .    in section [ esr_tra ]",
    "we study the deviation of the inhomogeneous low - temperature esr signal from the gaussian shape .",
    "we show that the signal from the one pentacene molecule is very similar to a gaussian showing almost no individual lines from hyperfine splittings .",
    "it appears that the esr lineshapes of a signal from many independent traps of the same kind must be a gaussian ( see [ singl][gene ] ) whose width is uniquely determined by a single localization parameter @xmath7 , namely an effective number of sites where carrier is localized .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that the non - gaussian lineshape can be ascribed to the superposition of signals from different kinds of traps , where each kind of trap is described by its own localization parameters @xmath7 . in section [ mult ]",
    "we derive an explicit relationship between the shape of the experimental esr signal and the distribution of the traps over the localization parameters @xmath7 .",
    "this relationship is a fredholm integral equation of the first kind where unknown function is a distribution of traps .",
    "section [ inverse ] presents an algorithm to solve it based on the stochastic optimization method ( som ) @xcite .",
    "we describe the som and present an analysis of its sensitivity to the experimental noise in sections [ inv_met ] and [ tests ] , respectively .",

    "section [ mmh - trans ] shows how the distribution of the traps over the localization parameter @xmath7 can be mapped as a distribution over the binding energies @xmath8 .",
    "this transformation can be formulated generally although a particular implementation of the mapping requires the explicit @xmath9 relationship between the binding energy @xmath8 and the localization parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this relationship for a given model can be obtained using the exact numeric diagrammatic monte carlo method @xcite , the analytic momentum average method @xcite , the coherent basis states method @xcite , or numerous other methods ( see [ ] for a review ) .",
    "we consider in section [ model - pent ] the model of two dimensional holstein polaron in the field of an on - site attractive center .",
    "the distribution of the trapped states over the binding energies @xmath8 in pentacene tfts are shown in section [ edis - tft ] .",
    "sections [ disc ] presents a discussion of our results and section [ concl ] provides conclusive remarks .",
    "in this section , we introduce the well - known characteristic features of the esr spectra of a single molecule and a cluster containing several molecules ( [ singl ] ) .",
    "we then present an analysis of a noticeably different case where the carrier is localized on a single impurity in a crystal ( [ gene ] ) .",
    "finally , we consider the case of traps of different origin where we can introduce a relationship between the lineshape of an experimental esr signal and the distribution of the impurities over different localization parameters ( [ mult ] ) .      in this section ,",
    "we consider a molecular crystal in which single molecule contains so many nuclear spins that its esr spectrum has an inhomogeneous gaussian shape .",
    "a typical situation for a carrier trapped in a molecular crystal is that it is localized in a trap and its distribution over the molecular crystal sites @xmath10 is characterized by a probability distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the temperature is assumed to be sufficiently low that we can neglect the `` homogeneous '' relaxation leading to the lorentzian shape of the esr signal .",
    "it is also low enough to avoid self - averaging of the inhomogeneities by the `` motional narrowing '' mechanism .    in this case",
    "the lineshape of the esr signal is determined by the `` inhomogeneous '' broadening caused by the site dependent distribution of the hyperfine interactions .",
    "when the typical width of the individual spectral lines of the split with hyperfine interaction quantum levels is larger than the typical energy distance between these levels @xcite , the lineshape of the esr signal is gaussian .",
    "this shape occurs when the carrier is localized in either a single molecule or a cluster containing several molecules .",
    "the case of a carrier trapped in a crystal is noticeably different from the case of a cluster with several molecules .",
    "the probability distribution over @xmath3 molecules @xmath10 @xmath12 is uniform @xmath13 in a cluster .",
    "in contrast , the probability distribution in a crystal trap @xmath14 , which is density of the carrier in given site @xmath10 , is not uniform , and the only restriction is the normalization condition @xmath15 .",
    "however , as shown below , the esr signal of a carrier in a trap always retains the gaussian shape and the width is uniquely determined by the carrier probability distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest esr signal considered in our study is that for a single molecule .",
    "the fine structure of the esr absorption by a single molecule in a condensed environment is frequently blurred by the broadening of the hyperfine levels .",
    "the esr signal from a single molecule in this case is gaussian .",
    "the standard expression describing the hyperfine structure of one molecule is @xcite @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the number of groups of equivalent nuclei , @xmath18 is the number of equivalent nuclei in the @xmath10th group , @xmath19 is the nuclear spin in the @xmath10th group , @xmath20 is the linewidth of each peak , p is the intensity of each peak and @xmath21 is the magnetic field .",

    "the standard situation , known from the physics of gases and solutions , is the case where the carrier is localized in a cluster containing @xmath3 molecules and its density is spread over @xmath3 molecules . in this case",
    "the signal retains its gaussian shape with the width of the distribution reduced by the factor @xmath31 .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the @xmath3 molecules can be simulated by eqs .",
    "( [ one_mol ] ) and ( [ pmmm ] ) by replacing @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig1]b shows an example of the spectrum for @xmath34 with standard deviation @xmath35 .",
    "it is clear that the oscillations around the gaussian envelope are quickly suppressed as @xmath3 increases .",
    "the shape and the @xmath4 narrowing factor of the esr signal for a carrier distributed over a cluster with @xmath3 molecules follow from the clt .",
    "the shifts of the signal , @xmath36 for the @xmath10-th molecule , is an independent random variable with gaussian distribution @xmath37 with standard deviation @xmath38 . by the clt ,",
    "the distribution @xmath39 of the random variable @xmath40 is also gaussian with @xmath41 .",

    "the squares show the distribution of the generated random variables and the solid lines are the fits by gaussian functions .",
    "the envelope gaussian function is normalized to unity in all panels . ]",
    "the situation for a carrier localized in a trap in a crystal is different from the above situation with @xmath3 molecules .",
    "the latter case assumes uniform charge distribution , and thus the clt applies .",
    "in contrast , the distribution over molecules @xmath10 in a trap @xmath11 is nonuniform with the probabilities @xmath14 subjected to the normalization condition @xmath45 .",
    "hence , we can not assume a gaussian lineshape for the esr signal ; the lineshape must be studied separately .",
    "regardless of the lineshape , the probability distribution @xmath11 unambiguously determines the linewidth of the esr signal .",
    "the linewidth is characterized by the standard deviation @xmath46 which is the root square of the second moment of the linewidth .",
    "if we consider the standard deviation of a signal in a trap @xmath46 and compare it with that from a single molecule @xmath38 we can introduce the effective number of molecules @xmath47 to describe the linewidth of the esr signal from a carrier in a trap .",

    "to conduct reliable spectral analysis as discussed above , we need high - precision esr spectra for the carriers in organic tfts .",
    "we acquired the spectra by the following procedures : we used a commercially - available x - band ( 9 ghz ) esr apparatus ( jes - fa200 , jeol ) equipped with a high q cylindrical cavity ( q factor 4000 - 6000 for the te@xmath111 mode ) .",

    "the problem with realistic noisy data from esr experiments is that there is some uncertainty in the normalization and background of the experimental data . in the ideal case , implying the normalization of the distribution @xmath67 to unity and the conditions @xmath116 and @xmath117=1 $ ] , we must normalize the experimental data as @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",

    "[ fig8]a ) and @xmath7 ( bold line in fig .  [ fig8]b ) on the attractive potential @xmath157 , and obtained @xmath188 ( bold line in fig .",
    "[ fig8]c ) .",
    "then , we used transformation ( [ transf ] ) .",
    "we found that the two discrete trap levels ( a  and  b ) peak at @xmath189 mev and @xmath190 mev , respectively . the broad feature ( c ) at the gate voltage -200 v is distributed between 5 and 15 mev , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the low - energy profile prompts the anticipation of tail states extending from just below the band edge , as has been discussed for amorphous semiconductors , while the states are partially occupied up to the fermi level at around @xmath8 = 5  mev .",
    "these results are roughly consistent with the small activation energy of about 15 mev for the motional narrowing observed in [ ] , and also with the potential fluctuations by atomic - force - microscope potentiometry @xcite .",
    "we note that the distribution @xmath133 gives relatively correct position of the trap levels , although the absolute value of the binding energy is rather model - dependent .",
    "weakly - localized in - gap states are expected to play crucial roles in the intrinsic charge transport along semiconductor / gate dielectric interfaces in organic transistors . in practice , temperature - independent mobility is often observed in devices with high mobility and highly - ordered molecular interfaces , which indicates that the fermi energy is just below the band edge @xcite .    to date ,",
    "various experimental techniques have been used to investigate the interfacial trap density , such as deep - level transient spectroscopy ( dlts ) @xcite , photocurrent yield @xcite , gate - bias stress @xcite , and thermally - stimulated current @xcite experiments .",
    "however , the measurements are based on the charge transport , and it is strongly affected by the `` extrinsic '' potential barriers at grain boundaries and/or channel / electrode interfaces . in striking contrast , our method has a crucial advantage in its ability to disclose the spatial and energy distribution of shallow traps down to a few mev , based on a unique microscopic probe using electronic spins .",
    "in addition , the g tensor can be used to identify the molecular species around the trap sites .",
    "for the three types ( a , b , and c ) of trap states obtained , the g tensor should be common , considering the highly symmetric nature of the esr spectra .",
    "this indicates that the trap states are extended over inherent pentacene molecules of regular orientation @xcite .",
    "of these , the deep discrete trap level ( a ) might be attributed to structural defects such as grain boundaries @xcite .     for gate voltage -200 v ( solid line ) , -120 v ( dashed line ) , and -40 v ( dotted line ) .",
    "]    the shallow discrete level ( b ) and the broad feature ( c ) might be ascribed to small defects such as molecular sliding along the long axes of the molecules @xcite , disorder induced by random dipoles in the amorphous gate dielectrics @xcite , thermal off - diagonal electronic disorder @xcite , and the fluctuations of the band edge @xcite .",
    "notice that the regular orientations of the molecules are retained in the trap states as stated above .",
    "although these assignments are rather speculative , we believe that further microscopic investigations based on this study will provide a comprehensive view of the weakly - localized in - gap states in organic transistors .    the lack of sensitivity of the strongly localized states with small @xmath7 to the gate voltage , which is obvious from the physical point of view , is an indication of the stability and reliability of the fine analysis of the esr spectra . for shallow states with large @xmath7 and small @xmath8 ,",
    "an increase in the gate voltage adds low - energy states that participate in creation of esr signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) .",
    "this shift of the border where states are visible to the esr probe indicates that these states are filled as the gate voltage increases .",
    "hence , this behavior can be interpreted as a movement of the fermi level which tends to zero energy as the bias voltage increases .",
    "it is important to mention that the sharp peak of @xmath67 at @xmath191 does not contradict the assumptions used to derive the integral equations ( [ conv1 ] ) and ( [ conv2 ] ) .",
    "the very essence of these equations implies that the contribution from each state with a given @xmath7 is a gaussian esr signal . on the other hand ,",
    "the signal at small @xmath7 is a more complicated function with fine features ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig1]a for @xmath192 ) .",
    "the results for distribution @xmath67 at small @xmath7 can be unreliable .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , the esr signal for reasonable parameters is close to gaussian even at @xmath191 .",
    "therefore , the results for the distribution of the traps @xmath67 are valid even for small values of the localization parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we have presented an unbiased analytical method for the processing of high - precision electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectra , which allows us to obtain the distribution of trapped carriers over the degree of localization and the binding energy .",
    "the first step is a fine analysis of the shape of the esr spectra by the som , which allows us to split the spectrum into multiple gaussian components each of which corresponds to a different spatial extension of the trapped carriers .",
    "the second step is the transformation of the distribution over the degree of localization into a distribution over the binding energies via a system - dependent relation between the binding energies and the localization parameters of the trapped carriers .",
    "we have presented and discussed the fundamental bases of the spectral analysis , detailed algorithms for practical applications , and discussed the robustness of the analysis to experimental noise .",
    "although the method can be applied to many systems , we consider that it is most appropriate for esr spectra of organic tfts for the following reasons .",
    "first , the channel materials are composed of regularly aligned organic molecules that involve multiple degrees of freedom for nuclear spin moments .",
    "this feature clearly justifies our basic assumption that a single type of trap gives the gaussian lineshape of the esr spectrum .",
    "secondly , it is possible to measure the high - precision esr spectrum because of the fairly small spin - orbit interactions of organic materials .",
    "the field - effect device structure also enables the control of the carrier density without introducing any randomness in the channel semiconductors .",
    "such a direct probe is quite unique in investigating the microscopic carrier dynamics in the organic tfts that have attracted considerable recent attention in the field of organic electronics .",
    "we have shown that the trap states in pentacene tfts can be classified into three major groups : deep trap states with a spatial extension of about 1.5 molecules ( a ) , relatively shallow trap states that extend over about 5 molecules ( b ) , and shallower trap states that extend over 6 to 20 molecules ( c ) .",
    "these states respectively correspond to deep and shallow trap states with binding energies of 140 mev ( a ) and 22 mev ( b ) , with the broad feature ranging from 5 to 15 mev ( c ) .",
    "these shallow in - gap states are crucial for understanding and improving the device performance of organic tfts .",

    "<S> our method has two steps . </S>",
    "<S> we first carry out a fine analysis of the shape of the esr spectra due to the trapped carriers ; this reveals the distribution of the trap density of the states over the degree of localization . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is based on the reasonable assumption that the linewidth of the trapped carriers is predetermined by their degree of localization because of the hyperfine mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we then transform the distribution over the degree of localization into a distribution over the binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation uses the relationships between the binding energies and the localization parameters of the trapped carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the particular relation for the system under study is obtained by the holstein model for trapped polarons using a diagrammatic monte carlo analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the application of the method to pentacene organic thin - film transistors . </S>"
