    "a first order phase transition from nuclear matter to some exotic form of matter might be possible in ( proto)neutron stars . it could be either a nuclear to quark matter transition or a first order pion / kaon condensation .",
    "consequently , it might have tremendous implications for compact stars @xcite and supernova explosions @xcite . here",
    "the focus is the first order phase transition proceeding through the thermal nucleation of a new phase in particular , antikaon condensed phase in hot and neutrino - trapped matter .",
    "after the pioneering work by kaplan and nelson on antikaon ( @xmath1 meson ) condensation in dense baryonic matter formed in heavy ion collisions as well as in neutron stars @xcite , several groups pursued the problem of antikaon condensation in ( proto)neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in most cases , the phase transition was studied using either maxwell construction or gibbs rules for phase equilibrium coupled with global baryon number and charge conservation @xcite . the first order phase transition driven by nucleation of antikaon",
    "condensed phase was considered in a few cases @xcite . in particular , the calculation of ref.@xcite dealt with the role of shear viscosity on the the thermal nucleation of antikaon condensed phase in hot and neutrino - free compact stars @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted here that the first order phase transition through the thermal nucleation of quark matter droplets was also investigated in ( proto)neutron stars @xcite using the homogeneous nucleation theory of langer @xcite .",
    "the thermal nucleation is an efficient process than the quantum nucleation at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "we adopt the homogeneous nucleation theory of langer @xcite for the thermal nucleation of antikaon condensed phase .",
    "nuclear matter would be metastable near the phase transition point due to sudden change in state variables . in this case",
    "thermal and quantum fluctuations are important .",
    "droplets of antikaon condensed matter are formed because of thermal fluctuations in the metastable nuclear matter .",
    "droplets of the new and stable phase which are bigger than a critical radius , will survive and grow .",
    "the transportation of latent heat from the surface of the droplet into the metastable phase favours a critical size droplet to grow further .",
    "this heat transportation could be achieved through the thermal dissipation and viscous damping @xcite .",
    "a parametrised form of the shear viscosity was used in earlier calculations of the nucleation of quark matter @xcite .",
    "recently , the influence of thermal conductivity and shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation time was studied in a first - order phase transition from nuclear to antikaon condensed matter in hot neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the shear viscosity due to neutrinos was not considered in that calculation .",
    "it would be worth studying the effect of shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation rate of droplets of antikaon condensed matter in neutrino - trapped matter relevant for protoneutron stars .",
    "besides shear viscosities due to neutrons , protons and electrons , this involves the contribution of neutrinos to the total shear viscosity .",
    "shear viscosities of pure neutron and neutron star matter were calculated by several groups @xcite .",
    "we also performed the calculation of shear viscosity in neutron star matter using the equation of state ( eos ) derived from relativistic field theoretical models @xcite .",
    "transport properties of degenerate neutrinos in dense matter were estimated by goodwin and pethick @xcite .",
    "we organise the paper in the following way .",
    "we describe models for eos , shear viscosities of different species including neutrinos and the calculation of thermal nucleation rate in sec .",
    "results of this calculation are discussed in sec .",
    "iv gives the summary and conclusions .",
    "the knowledge of the eos for nuclear as well as antikaon condensed phases is essential for the computation of shear viscosity and thermal nucleation rate .",
    "we consider a first - order phase transition from the charge neutral and @xmath2-equilibrated nuclear matter to @xmath1 condensed matter in a protoneutron star .",
    "those two phases are composed of neutrons , protons , electrons , electron type neutrinos and of @xmath1 mesons only in the antikaon condensed phase .",
    "both phases are governed by baryon number conservation and charge neutrality conditions @xcite .",
    "relativistic field theoretical models are used to describe the eos in nuclear and antikaon condensed phases .",
    "the baryon - baryon interaction is mediated by the exchange of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 and given by the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath6 the scalar self - interaction term @xcite is @xmath7 the effective nucleon mass is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the vacuum baryon mass . the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling scheme",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath10 where the covariant derivative is @xmath11 and the effective mass of ( anti)kaons is @xmath12 . for s - wave ( @xmath13 ) condensation ,",
    "the in - medium energy of @xmath14 mesons is given by @xmath15 the condensation in neutrino - trapped matter sets in when the chemical potential of @xmath1 mesons ( @xmath16 ) is equal to the difference between the electron chemical potential ( @xmath17 ) and neutrino chemical potential ( @xmath18 ) i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "the critical droplet of antikaon condensed matter is in total phase equilibrium with the metastable nuclear matter .",
    "the mixed phase is governed by gibbs phase rules along with global baryon number conservation and charge neutrality @xcite .",
    "we adopt the bulk approximation @xcite which does not consider the variation of the meson fields with position inside the droplet . we solve equations of motion self - consistently in the mean field approximation @xcite and",
    "find effective masses and fermi momenta of baryons .",
    "pressures in neutrino - trapped nuclear matter ( @xmath20 ) and antikaon condensed matter ( @xmath21 ) are given by ref.@xcite .",
    "here we calculate zero temperature equations of state because it was noted earlier that the temperature of a few tens of mev did not modify the eos considerably @xcite .",
    "next we discuss the calculation of shear viscosity in protoneutron star matter .",
    "it was noted in earlier calculations that the main contributions to the total shear viscosity in neutron star matter came from electrons , the lightest charged particles , and neutrons , the most abundant particles @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are trapped in protoneutron stars and their contribution might be significant in transport coefficients such as shear viscosity . in principle , we may calculate shear viscosities for different particle species ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) in neutrino - trapped matter using coupled boltzmann transport equations @xcite .",
    "we can immediately write a set of relations between effective relaxation times ( @xmath26 ) and collision frequencies ( @xmath27 ) following the ref.@xcite @xmath28 which can be cast into a @xmath29 matrix . however , solving the matrix equation becomes a problem because the relaxation time for neutrinos is much larger than those of other species as it is evident from fig .",
    "so we calculate shear viscosities due to neutrons , protons and electrons in neutrino - trapped matter from the above matrix equation as it was done in ref.@xcite . in this case , the effects of the exchange of transverse plasmons in the collisions of charged particles are included @xcite .",

    "droplets of antikaon condensed matter above a critical size ( @xmath49 ) will grow and drive the phase transition . according to the homogeneous nucleation formalism of langer and others , the thermal nucleation per unit time per unit volume is given by @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the free energy cost to produce a droplet with a critical size in the metastable nuclear matter .",

    "the temperature dependence of shear viscosities is a complex one and quite different from the characteristic @xmath84 behaviour of a fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the shear viscosities of neutrons , protons and electrons in neutrino - trapped nuclear matter are of the same orders of magnitude as those of the neutrino - free case @xcite .",

    "relaxation times of different particle species due to scattering under strong and electromagnetic interactions are much much smaller than that of neutrinos undergoing scattering with other species through weak interactions .",
    "consequently , particles excluding neutrinos come into thermal equilibrium quickly on the time scale of weak interactions .",

    "the dynamical prefactor not only depends on the shear viscosity but also on the thermal conductivity and bulk viscosity .",

    "we only consider the effect of shear viscosity on the prefactor . besides transport coefficients , the prefactor in particular ,",
    "the statistical prefactor is sensitive to the correlation length of kaons and surface tension .",

    "the radius of a critical droplet is to be greater than the correlation length ( @xmath61 ) for kaons @xcite .",
    "we perform our calculation with antikaon droplets with radii greater than 5 fm .",
    "the other important parameter in the prefactor is the surface tension .",
    "the surface tension between nuclear and kaon phases was already estimated by christiansen and collaborators @xcite and found to be sensitive to the eos .",
    "we perform this calculation for a set of values of surface tension @xmath87 15 , 20 , 25 and 30 mev @xmath88 .",
    "the prefactor ( @xmath85 ) is shown as a function of temperature in fig .",
    "it is shown for a baryon density @xmath89 which is just above the critical density 3.9@xmath90 for antikaon condensation at zero temperature @xcite , and surface tension @xmath91 mev @xmath88 .",
    "the prefactor was also approximated by @xmath0 according to the dimensional analysis in many calculations @xcite .",
    "the upper curve in fig .",
    "5 shows the prefactor of eq .",
    "( 21 ) including only the contribution of neutrino shear viscosity whereas the prefactor approximated by @xmath0 corresponds to the lower curve .",
    "it is evident from figure 5 that the approximated prefactor is very small compared with our result .",
    "now we discuss the nucleation time of a critical droplet of antikaon condensed phase in neutrino - trapped nuclear matter and the effect of neutrino shear viscosity on it .",
    "the thermal nucleation rate of the critical droplet is calculated within a volume with @xmath92 m in the core of a neutron star where the density , pressure and temperature are constant .",
    "the thermal nucleation time is plotted with temperature for a baryon density @xmath89 in fig .",
    "furthermore , this calculation is done with the kaon correlation length @xmath93 5 fm and surface tension @xmath87 15 , 20 , 25 and 30 mev @xmath88 .",
    "the size of the critical droplet increases with increasing surface tension .",
    "radii of the critical droplets are 7.1 , 9.4 , 11.7 and 14.1 fm corresponding to @xmath94 15 , 20 , 25 and 30 mev @xmath88 , respectively , at a baryon density @xmath95 .",
    "the nucleation time of the critical droplet diminishes as temperature increases for all cases studied here .",
    "however , the temperature corresponding to a particular nucleation time for example @xmath96 s , increases as the surface tension increases .",
    "there is a possibility that the condensate might melt down if the temperature is higher than the critical temperature .",
    "so far , there is no calculation of critical temperature of antikaon condensation in neutrino - trapped matter .",
    "however , the critical temperature of antikaon condensation was investigated in neutrino - free matter in ref.@xcite .",
    "we compare thermal nucleation times corresponding to different values of the surface tension with the early post bounce time scale @xmath97 100 ms in the core collapse supernova @xcite when the central density might reach the threshold density of antikaon condensation .",
    "the time scale @xmath98 is much less than the neutrino diffusion time @xmath86 1 s as obtained by ref.@xcite .",
    "thermal nucleation of the antikaon condensed phase may be possible when the thermal nucleation time is less than @xmath99 . for @xmath87 15 mev @xmath88 ,",
    "the thermal nucleation time of @xmath96 s occurs at a temperature 16 mev .",
    "it is evident from fig . 6",
    "that the thermal nucleation time is strongly dependent on the surface tension .",
    "further thermal nucleation of an antikaon droplet is possible so long as the condensate might survive the melt down at high temperatures@xcite .",
    "our results of thermal nucleation time are compared with the calculation taking into account the prefactor approximated by @xmath0 in fig . 7 for surface tension @xmath87 15 mev @xmath88 and at a density @xmath89 .",
    "the upper curve denotes the calculation with @xmath0 approximation whereas the lower curve corresponds to the influence of neutrino shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation time .",
    "the results of the @xmath0 approximation overestimate our results hugely . for a nucleation time of @xmath96",
    "s at a temperature t=16 mev , the corresponding time in the @xmath0 approximation is larger by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we have studied shear viscosities of different particle species in neutrino - trapped @xmath2-equilibrated and charge neutral nuclear matter .",
    "we have derived equations of state of nuclear and antikaon condensed phases in the relativistic mean field model for the calculation of shear viscosity . it is noted that neutrons , protons and electrons come into thermal equilibrium in the weak interaction time scale",
    ". the shear viscosity due to neutrinos is calculated treating other particles as background and found to dominate the total shear viscosity .",
    "next we have investigated the first - order phase transition from neutrino - trapped nuclear matter to antikaon condensed matter through the thermal nucleation of a critical droplet of antikaon condensed matter using the same relativistic eos as discussed above .",
    "our emphasis in this calculation is the role of the shear viscosity due to neutrinos in the prefactor and its consequences on the thermal nucleation rate .",
    "we have observed that the thermal nucleation of a critical antikaon droplet might be possible well before the neutrino diffusion takes place .",
    "furthermore , a comparison of our results with that of the calculation of thermal nucleation time in the @xmath0 approximation shows that the latter overestimates our results of thermal nucleation time computed with the prefactor including the neutrino shear viscosity .",
    "though we have performed this calculation with antikaon optical potential depth of @xmath79 mev , we expect qualitatively same results for other values of the antikaon optical potential depth @xcite .",

    "<S> we study shear viscosities of different species in hot and neutrino - trapped dense matter relevant to protoneutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the shear viscosities of neutrons , protons and electrons in neutrino - trapped matter are of the same orders of magnitude as the corresponding shear viscosities in neutrino - free matter . </S>",
    "<S> above all , the shear viscosity due to neutrinos is higher by several orders of magnitude than that of other species in neutrino - trapped matter .    </S>",
    "<S> next we investigate the effect of shear viscosity in particular , neutrino shear viscosity on the thermal nucleation rate of droplets of antikaon condensed matter in protoneutron stars . the first - order phase transition from hadronic matter to antikaon condensed matter </S>",
    "<S> is driven by the thermal nucleation process . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the equation of state used for the calculation of shear viscosity and thermal nucleation time within the relativistic mean field model . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino shear viscosity enhances the prefactor in the nucleation rate by several orders of magnitude compared with the @xmath0 approximation of earlier calculations . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the thermal nucleation time in the @xmath0 approximation overestimates our result . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the thermal nucleation of an antikaon droplet might be possible in neutrino - trapped matter before neutrino diffusion takes place . </S>"
