    "loop quantum gravity had never been considered a candidate of the unification of matter and gravity until a remarkable series of discoveries emerged recently .",
    "first , markopoulou and kribs@xcite discovered that loop quantum gravity and many related theories of dynamical quantum geometry have emergent excitations which carry conserved quantum numbers not associated with geometry or the gravitational field .    around the same time",
    ", bilson - thompson@xcite found that a composite or preon \" model of the quarks , leptons and vector bosons could be coded in the possible ways that three ribbons can be braided and twisted .",
    "this suggested that the particles of the standard model could be discovered amidst the emergent braid states and their conserved quantum numbers associated with those of the standard model .",
    "one realization of this was then given in @xcite , for a particular class of dynamic quantum geometry models based on 3-valent quantum spin - networks obtained by gluing trinions together .",
    "these are coded in the knotting and braiding of the edges of the spin network ; they are degrees of freedom because of the basic result that quantum gravity or the quantization of any diffeomorphism invariant gauge theory has a basis of states given by embeddings up to diffeomorphisms of a set of labeled graphs in a spatial manifold .",
    "indeed , the role of the braiding of the edges of the graphs had been a mystery for many years .",
    "however , spin foam models in @xmath0 dimensions involve embedded 4-valent spin networks@xcite .",
    "it is then natural to ask if there are conservation laws associated with braids in 4-valent spin - networks . besides , quantum gravity with a positive cosmological cons- tant@xcite and quantum deformation of quantum gravity@xcite suggest the framing of embedded spin - networks . in this paper",
    "we extend the investigation of the braid excitations from the 3-valent case to the 4-valent case .",
    "we study ( framed ) 4-valent spin - networks embedded in 3d .    due to the complexity of embedded 4-valent spin - networks , to deal with the braid excitations of them we need a consistent and convenient mathematical formalism . in this paper , which is the first of a series of papers on the subject , we first propose a new notation of the embedded ( framed ) 4-valent spin - networks and define what we mean by braids , then discuss equivalence moves with the help of our notation , which relate all diffeomorphic embedded 4-valent graphs and form the graphical calculus of the kinematics of these graphs , and at the end present a classification of the braids .",
    "these results are key to our subsequent papers .",
    "we focus on 3-strand braids , which are the simplest non - trivial and interesting braid excitations living on embedded 4-valent spin - networks .",
    "firstly , we fix the notation , namely a tube - sphere notation .",
    "we work in the category of framed graphs , in particular the two dimentional projections representing embedded framed 4-valent spin networks up to diffeomorphisms .",
    "there is a single diffeomorphism class of nodes .",
    "we therefore represent nodes by rigid 2-spheres and edges by tubes .",
    "such a node can be considered locally dual to a tetrahedron , as shown in fig .",
    "[ notation](a ) .",
    "if the spin - nets are not framed , we simply reduce tubes to lines but still keep spheres as nodes . to fully characterize the embedding of a spin - net in a 3-manifold , we assume that not only the nodes are rigid , i.e. they can only be rotated or translated , but also the positions on the node where the edges are attached are fixed . this requirement and",
    "the local duality ensures the non - degeneracy of the nodes , i.e. no more than two edges of a node are co - planar . for the convenience of calculation",
    ", we simplify the tube - sphere notation in fig .",
    "[ notation](a ) to fig .",
    "[ notation](b ) , in which 1 ) the sphere is replaced by a solid circle ; 2 ) the two tubes in the front , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in ( a ) , are replaced by a solid line piercing through the circle in ( b ) ; and 3 ) the two tubes in the back , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in ( a ) are substituted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 in ( b ) with a dashed line connecting them through the circle . there is no loss of generality in taking this simplified notation , because one can always arrange a node in the two states like fig .",
    "[ notation](b ) & ( c ) by diffeomorphism before taking a projection .",
    "due to the local duality between a node and a tetrahedron and the fact that all the four edges of a node are on an equal footing , if we choose one of the four edges of a node at a time , the other three edges are still on an equal footing , in respect to a rotation symmetry with the specially chosen edge as the rotation axis , e.g. the edge @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ notation](b ) & ( c ) . this rotation symmetry will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "there could exist twists on embedded tubes , e.g. the @xmath5-twist on the edge @xmath3 with respect to the solid red dot , shown in fig .",
    "[ notationtwist](a ) .",
    "note that we put twists in the unit of @xmath5 for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that the possible states by which a node may be represented in a projection can be taken into each other by @xmath5 rotations around one of the edges of the node ( this will become clear in section [ subsecrot ] ) . by the local duality of a node to a tetrahedron",
    ", these correspond to the @xmath5 rotations that relate the different ways that two tetrahedra may be glued together on a triangular face .",
    "these rotations create twists in the edges and , as a result of the restriction on projections of nodes we impose , set the twists in a projection of an edge of a spin network in units of @xmath5 .",
    "the other reason is that the least twist distinguishable from zero of a piece of tube in a projection is @xmath5 and all higher twists distinguishable from each other in the projection must then be multiples of @xmath5 .    because an edge is always between two nodes and a rotation of a node creates / annihilates twists on its edges , one usually needs to specify the fixed point on an edge with respect to which a twist is counted , as shown in fig . [",
    "notationtwist](a ) . in this manner , the 1 unit of twist in fig .",
    "[ notationtwist](a ) is obviously equivalent to that in [ notationtwist](b ) , which is the same amount of twist in the opposite direction on the other side of the fixed point .",
    "interestingly , both twists in fig . [ notationtwist](a ) and ( b ) are right - handed twists if one point his / her right thumb to the node on the same sides of the fixed point as that of the twists ; therefore , we can unambiguously assign the same value to them , namely @xmath6 ( unit of @xmath5 ) .",
    "this provides a way of simplifying the notation of twist , i.e. we can simply label an edge with a ( left- ) right - handed twist  a ( negative ) positive integer .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ notationtwist](a ) and ( b ) can be replaced by [ notationtwist](c ) without ambiguity .    recalling the rotation axis mentioned before",
    ", one can assign states to a node with respect to its rotation axis .",
    "if the rotation axis is an edge in the back , we say the node is in state @xmath7 , or is simply called a @xmath7-node , e.g. fig .",
    "[ notation](b ) with edge @xmath3 as the rotation axis .",
    "otherwise , if the rotation axis is an edge in the back , the node is called a @xmath8-node or in the state @xmath8 , e.g. fig .",
    "[ notation](c ) with edge @xmath4",
    ".      the results of this paper will refer to the case of framed spin networks , defined above .",
    "however , unframed graphs are used in loop quantum gravity and it is useful to have results then for that case as well .",
    "the particular notation of unframed graphs is obtained from the framed case discussed here by dropping information about twists of the edges ( which thus represent curves rather than tubes ) , but keeping the nodes as rigid spheres , locally dual to tetrahedra .",
    "this is necessary so that the evolution moves are well defined for unframed embedded graphs , which will be explained in the second of this series of papers .    in the rest of this paper",
    "we refer always to the framed case .",
    "results for the unframed case will be understood from those for the framed case by neglecting the twists of the edges , unless we explicitly describe them .",
    "equipped with the notation defined above , we are interested in a type of topological structures as sub - structures of embedded 4-valent spin networks , namely 3-strand braids , which are defined as follows .",
    "[ defbraid]a * * 3-strand braid ( * * or a * braid * for simplicity * * ) * * is a sub - spinnet of an embedded 4-valent spin network , which is a three dimensional object formed by two nodes with three common edges , now named * * strand**s ; the two nodes are called * * end - node**s , each of which has one and only one free edge , called an * external edge*. the two dimensional projections of these braids denoted in our notation are called braid diagrams , a typical example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ braid ] .",
    "the following conditions should be satisfied :    1 .",
    "if braids are arranged horizontally , then the ( left ) right external edge of a braid can always be the ( left- ) right - most edge of the ( left ) right end - node , and always stretches to the ( left ) right , which has no tangles with the strands , for the left part of the braid diagram in fig . [",
    "notbraid](a ) as an example ; 2 .",
    "what is captured between the two end - nodes , e.g. the region between the two dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ braid ] , should meet the definition of braid in the ordinary braid theory , for the braid diagram in fig .",
    "[ notbraid](b ) as an example ; 3 .",
    "the three strands of a braid are never tangled with any other edge of the spin - net , as illustrated in right side of the braid diagram in fig .",
    "[ notbraid](a ) , for example . + [ p ]    we would like to emphasize that the braids defined above are 3d structures , each of which has many diffeomorphic embeddings that are represented by their 2d projections in our notation .",
    "as a result , the 2d projections of many braids , i.e. their braid diagrams , which appear to be different are actually equivalent to each other in the sense of diffeomorphism .",
    "the precise set of equivalence relations will be the topic of the next section .",
    "bearing this in mind , in the rest of the paper we are not going to distinguish braids from their braid diagrams , unless an ambiguity arises .",
    "these kinds of braids are different from the braids in the context of ordinary braid theory , since the two end - nodes of such a braid are topologically significant to the state of the braid .",
    "these braid are stable under a certain stability condition regarding the evolution of spin - nets , which will be brought up in the companion paper . however , in this paper , we focus only on the intrinsic properties of these braids , or in other words the pure topological properties of the braids up to diffeomorphism , i.e. without dynamic evolution .",
    "to do so , we need to first describe the non - dynamical operations that can be applied to the embedded 4-valent spin networks .",
    "we can assign a number to a crossing according to its chirality , viz @xmath6 for a right - handed crossing , @xmath9 for a left - handed crossing , and @xmath10 otherwise .",
    "[ assignment ]  shows this assignment .",
    "[ p ]    such a scheme of assignment will become useful in the subsequent discussions .",
    "as aforementioned , the tube diagrams of an embedded spin network belong to different equivalence classes .",
    "it is therefore obligatory to characterize these equivalence classes by equivalence relations .",
    "to do so , one needs to find the full set of local moves , operating on the nodes and edges , which do nt change the diffeomorphism class of the embedding of a diagram . in the discussion below we work in the framed case . in the unframed case",
    ", one just ignores the twists .",
    "an obvious set of equivalence moves consists of the usual three reidemeister moves , framed or unframed , whose details are not repeated here ; these moves will be applied without further notice .",
    "more importantly , there are two kinds of equivalence moves that can be peculiarly defined on an embedded 4-valent spin - net , under which two diagrams , in particular two braids , that are related by a sequence of equivalence moves are thought to be equivalent .",
    "the first kind composes of translation moves .",
    "the second type of equivalence moves are rotations defined on the nodes .",
    "we discuss translation moves first .",
    "translation moves , which are in fact extended reidemeister type moves , involve not only the edges but also the nodes of an embedded spin - net ; they reflect the translation symmetry of the embedded spin - nets .",
    "let us look at the simplest example first .",
    "[ translation](a ) shows a node @xmath11 connected to other places of the network via its four edges ; red points represent attached points on other nodes .",
    "one can slide the node @xmath11 along its edge @xmath12 to the left , which leads to fig .",
    "[ translation](b ) ; this does not change anything of the topology of the embedded spin - net .",
    "[ translationx ] illustrates more complicated cases where a crossing is taken into account .",
    "[ p ]    in fig .",
    "[ translationx](a1 ) there is a node @xmath11 and a crossing ; however , since the crossing is between the edge @xmath12 of node @xmath11 and the edge @xmath13 of some other node and node @xmath11 together with all its edges are above edge @xmath13 , one can safely translate node @xmath11 along edge @xmath12 to the left passing the crossing , which results in fig . [",
    "translationx](a2 ) , in which the crossing turns out to be between edge @xmath13 and edge @xmath14 .",
    "this , which is obviously a symmetry , may be understood as a reidemeister move ii .",
    "[ p ]      apart from the translation symmetry , there is also a rotation symmetry that gives rise to rotations defined on a node , with respect to one of its four edges , of an embedded spin - net .",
    "these rotations are not those with rigid metric but only the ones that change projections of an embedding , without affecting diffeomorphisms .      as mentioned before , @xmath5 rotations take states representing a node in a projection into each other .",
    "it is time to see in detail how these rotations affect a subgraph consisting of a node and its four edges .",
    "[ pi3rot+ ] shows such a rotation in the case where the node is in a @xmath7-state with respect to the chosen rotation axis before imposing the rotation , while fig .",
    "[ pi3rot- ] illustrates the opposite case .",
    "[ p ]    [ p ]    a @xmath5 rotation creates a crossing of two edges of the node and causes twists , which are explicitly labeled , on all edges of the node .",
    "the twist number on the rotation axis of a node is always opposite to that of the other three edges of the node .",
    "note that a @xmath5-rotation changes the state of a node , as shown in figures [ pi3rot+ ] and [ pi3rot- ] , i.e. if the node is in state @xmath7 before the rotation , it becomes a @xmath8-node after the rotation .",
    "this is the key to the first reason that we put the twists in an edge in units of @xmath5 .",
    "a @xmath5 rotation relates two projections of an embedded spin network , which belong to the same diffeomorphism class .",
    "two consecutive @xmath5 rotations certainly give rise to a @xmath15 rotation .",
    "however , it is intuitive to understand @xmath15 rotations in a more topological way .",
    "obviously , rotating a tetrahedron by an angle of @xmath15 with respect to the normal of any of the four faces of the tetrahedron does not change the view of it . therefore , by the local duality between a node and a tetrahedron , as long as an edge of a node is chosen , the other three edges of the node are on an equal footing .",
    "if we rotate a node with respect to any of its four edges by @xmath15 , the resulting diagram should be diffeomorphic to , or in our context equivalent to , the original one . in fig .",
    "[ 2pi3rot+ ] and fig .",
    "[ 2pi3rot- ] we list all the @xmath15-rotations .",

    "@xmath5 rotations are the smallest building blocks of all possible rotations ; they are thus the generators of all rotations .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pi3rot+ ] through fig .",
    "[ pirot- ] , each of which can be directly used in a graphic calculation .",
    "recall that all the equivalence moves defined above are diffeomorphic operations on the embedded graphs . as an example ,",
    "[ equibraids ] depicts two braids that can be deformed into each other by a @xmath5 rotation of node 2 with respect to its external edge @xmath16 .",
    "we say these two braids are equivalent to each other .",
    "[ ph ]    note that for an end - node of a braid , only its external edge is allowed to be the rotation axis , with respect to which the equivalence rotation moves are applied .",
    "otherwise , one may end up with a situation similar to fig .",
    "[ badbraid ] , which does not satisfy definition [ defbraid ] . therefore , although sub - spinnets like fig .",
    "[ badbraid ] are equivalent to well - defined braids by rotation moves , they are not to be investigated because they complicate the clear structure of braids and do not have any new interesting property . thus for simplicity we only allow the external edge of an end - node of a braid to be the rotation axis . if a node is not an end - node of a braid , any of its four edges can be chosen as a rotation axis .",
    "[ ph ]    by looking carefully at the rotations and the crossings and twists generated accordingly one can find that the assignment of values to crossings , shown in fig .",

    "one can easily check that the rotations in fig .",
    "[ pi3rot+ ] through fig .",
    "[ pirot- ] satisfy @xmath21 .",
    "that is , rotations have a zero effective twist number . therefore we can enlarge @xmath22 to a more general quantity @xmath23 , the * effective twist number of subdiagrams * of an embedded spin - net , which are related by rotations of nodes , by taking into account all the edges that are affected by rotations .",
    "we define @xmath24    where @xmath19 is the twist number on an edge of the subdiagram , @xmath20 is the crossing number of a crossing in the subdiagram . since @xmath21 , @xmath23 is indeed a conserved quantity under rotations .",

    "[ theta0 ] is also found to be preserved by translation moves .",
    "note that the effective twist number is not defined in the unframed case , simply because the unframed case has no notion of twists .",
    "with the help of equivalence moves , in particular the rotation moves , we can classify all possible 3-strand braids into two major types , namely reducible braids and irreducible braids , whose definitions are given below .",
    "the aforementioned restriction that only the external edge of an end - node of a braid can be the rotation axis of the node ensures the unambiguous assignments of states to the end nodes of a braid and keeps the classification of braids simple .",
    "note that twists on edges are irrelevant to the calculation in the section ; they are thus neglected throughout the discussion . nevertheless , the results are valid for both framed and unframed cases .    for the purpose of classifying the braids , we also consider braids as if they are isolated regions in a graph .",
