    "colloidal semiconductor nanoclusters ( ncs ) or quantum dots ( qds ) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their applications in the fields of optoelectronics , spintronics , photovoltaic or bio - labeling@xcite and to their potential to emerge as the key components of the next generation displays @xcite .",
    "one important milestone was the synthesis of core - shell quantum dots , which contain at least two semiconductors arrangement in an onion - like geometry @xcite . in this ,",
    "the core material is surrounded by a different shell material in order to reduce the influence of the possibly imperfect surface onto the core .",
    "indeed , semiconductor core - shell ncs with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency were reported @xcite .",
    "the theoretical modeling of these type of structures , performed at the level of the effective mass approximation@xcite , the @xmath0 method@xcite , the tight - binding approach@xcite or the empirical pseudopotential method@xcite were done assuming perfect , unstrained , and unrelaxed atomic positions .",
    "indeed , colloidal quantum dots in their fluid environment were often considered as unstrained , in direct contrast to their self - assembled ( stransky krastanov ) omologues that are known to only exist because of the presence of strain .",
    "the estimate of the atomic relaxation and ensuing strain is not straight forward in colloidal quantum dots as the use of continuum models@xcite or empirical force field @xcite would require insights about the surface effects .",
    "these are difficult to quantify as the surface relaxes inwards , shortening the bond - length , but these bonds are weakened .",
    "only very recently , _ ab - initio _ large - scale calculations showed that the effect of structural relaxation in colloidal qds is important @xcite and a lack of such relaxation leads , for instance , to the appearance of unphysical imaginary vibrational frequencies@xcite and red shifts of vibrational modes@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we perform large - scale _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) calculations to study the structural and vibrational properties of core - shell si(core)-ge(shell ) , the inverted ge - si , inas - inp , and cdse - cds ncs with radii ranging from 13.5 to 15.6   . we find that ( i ) the shell dictates the atom positions of the entire core - shell ncs .",
    "this is especially true for group iv si - ge and ge - si ncs where we see almost no difference between the bond length distribution of the core - shell ncs and the pure nc made of only shell material .",
    "for instance , the ge core in a core - shell ge - si nc is compressed to the bulk si lattice constant ( 4% compression of the bond length ) .",
    "( ii ) both the core and the shell are compressed in the inas - inp and in the cdse - cds ncs .",
    "so the lattice constants of core and shell materials do not undergo the compromise of one having compressive and the other tensile strain , as one may expect .",
    "( iii ) the bond - length distribution in the ncs goes from homogeneous ( small scattering ) throughout the ncs for our group iv ncs to inhomogeneous only at the interface for our group iii - vs , to inhomogeneous in the entire shell region in our ii - vis ncs .",
    "we speculate that the long - range coulombic interaction in the more ionic ii - vis is responsible for the large bond distortions .",
    "( iv ) the frequency shifts we obtain , compared to the bulk frequencies , for our ncs can all be traced back to two fundamental effects : one being the shift of the modes according to strain ( given by the grneisen parameters ) , the second being the red - shift created by the undercoordination of the near - surface atoms .",
    "both effects tend to work against each other since the ncs are typically compressively strained and the strain effect leads to a blue - shift ( with a positive grneisen parameter ) .",
    "we first construct an un - relaxed ncs by cutting a sphere , centered on an atom for group ivs or a cation for iii - vs and ii - vis with @xmath1 point group symmetry , out of bulk zinc - blende material .",
    "then , the surface atoms with only one nearest neighbor bond are removed and the surface dangling bonds are terminated by hydrogen atoms for group iv atoms and pseudo - hydrogen atoms @xmath2 with a fractional charge of 1/2 , 3/4 , 5/4 , and 3/2 for group vi , v , iii , and ii atoms , respectively .",
    "these atomic positions are relaxed using dft in the local density approximation ( lda ) and trouiller - martin norm - conserving pseudopotentials with an energy cutoff of 30 ry for group iv and iii - v clusters and 40 ry for ii - vi clusters@xcite . in order to calculate the vibrational eigenmodes of cd - vi clusters with up to one thousand atoms",

    "our combined peak is red - shifted compared to the experimental results . from the two effects mainly responsible for frequency shifts , strain and undercoordination , only the latter effect is relevant since the cds shell is already mainly unstrained in our nc ( see fig  [ fig : geom_cdsse ] ) . the undercoordination effect becomes weaker with increasing shell size and we expect a blue shift of peaks a and a@xmath16 if we go towards the experimental situation with a much thicker shell , until they reach the bulk value of around 300  @xmath5 ( fig .",

    "the green highlighted area shows the interface region and the violet area the region where passivant atoms are present defining a surface region . ]    as a final remark , we note that while the large majority of theoretical work on core - shell qds neglect the effect of strain altogether , some used simple continuum models @xcite leading to the erroneous conclusion , due to the absence of the surface effect , that the shell structure experiences tensile strain or missed the existence of certain raman active modes with interface or surface character , such as the les mode ( our mode b ) .",
    "the lack of the latter has forced more intricate interpretation of the experiment in terms of excitonic effects @xcite , which seem , in view of the present _ ab initio _ results , at least not necessary to interpret the experimental results .",
    "a cheap empirical valence force field description would certainly be advantageous , but seem presently out of reach due to the complexity of surface and interface effects .",
    "a reasonable valence force field description of the vibrational property of iii - v ncs was proposed earlier @xcite for pure ncs .",
    "an extension towards core - shell structures and group ii - vi or group iv may be worthwhile , although certainly tedious .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the structural and vibrational properties of colloidal semiconductor core - shell ncs with up to 1000 atoms via _ ab initio _ dft calculations .",
    "we find that the geometry of si - ge and inverted ge - si clusters is determined by the shell part and there is no bond length distortion at the core - shell interface of these group iv ncs . also for our iii - v and ii - vi core - shell ncs ,",
    "the geometry of the shell is similar to that of the corresponding pure ncs made of shell material .",
    "accordingly , the vibrational dos of the shell - type vibrations in core - shell ncs is very similar to the vibrational dos of pure ncs made of shell material .",
    "hence , the shell experiences no tensile strain but is rather compressed .",
    "this fact could be used to improve continuum model descriptions that suggested the opposite situation ( tensile shell ) .    for our iii - v and ii - vi core - shell",
    "ncs we find that the bond - length of the core remains very heavily compressed .",
    "we also find an obvious bond length distortion at the core - shell interface of our iii - v and ii - vi core - shell ncs .",
    "this distortion ( i.e. , scattering in the bond - length distribution ) extends beyond the interface region all the way to the surface in cdse - cds core - shell ncs .",
    "we link the bond - length distortion to the long range ionic interaction , which is strong in the more ionic ii - vi ncs @xcite .",
    "this large scattering of the bond - length distribution leads to a significant broadening of the vibrational bands , which is consequently especially prominent for ii - vi ncs .",
    "we also observe a lack of shift in the acoustic modes which we trace back to the mixing of la and ta modes , with their nearly compensating positive and negative grneisen parameters @xcite .",
    "we obtain a blue- ( red- ) shift in the optical modes of the core parts in ge - si ( si - ge ) ncs , which can be traced back to the compressed ( expanded ) bond lengths .",
    "in addition , we find that the interface modes of iii - v and ii - vi core - shell ncs are just within the manifold of the core and the shell modes and overlap with the surface modes , which will make them difficult to identify experimentally .    finally , we compared our results with recent raman experiments and give a new interpretation of the results based on the lack of tensile strain and the existence of the undercoordination effect .",
    "the qualitative picture of our frequency shifts can be understood based on two , often competing , effects of compressive strain ( blue - shift of optical modes ) and undercoordination ( red - shift ) .",
    "we further show that the often discussed low - energy shoulder on the raman spectra originate from interface vibrations with small surface character , in agreement with most of the experimental interpretations and in disagreement with earlier theoretical models .",
