    "it is important to select an excited state having large transition strengths from both weakly bound and deeply bound levels . in general , the strengths of molecular transitions from low vibrational levels are readily predicted on the basis of the franck - condon factors ( fcfs ) calculated from a potential energy curve or molecular constants @xcite .",
    "the small number of nodes in the radial wavefunction for a low vibrational level indicates a low sensitivity to deviations in the radial direction , thereby enabling us to explain the intensity distribution over vibrational levels from molecular constants .",
    "however , it is difficult to predict transition strengths from weakly bound molecular levels because weakly bound levels have a large number of nodes in their wavefunctions ; hence , the fcfs are quite sensitive to the wavefunctions of excited states . in this letter , we show that transition strengths from weakly bound levels can be predicted on the basis of an accurate potential energy curve of the excited state , constructed via direct potential fit ( dpf ) analysis @xcite of both vibrational energies and rotational constants .",
    "we focused on the @xmath2 state of krb in the range 1140011800 @xmath7 with respect to the ground atomic threshold , which was proposed as a potential candidate for the stirap transfer of weakly bound molecules to the rovibrational ground state @xcite .",
    "an rkr potential curve of the @xmath2 state was reported from the potential minimum up to 10400 @xmath7 @xcite . an ionization spectrum for @xmath8k@xmath1rb obtained by using a pulse laser and a depletion spectrum near 11700 @xmath7",

    "we found that the width of the observed spectra was highly dependent on the vibrational levels of the @xmath2 state . by introducing an analytical representation for power broadening",

    "the other electronic states that correlate with the @xmath2 state via spin - orbit interaction were far away ; hence we assumed that most of the perturbations from these electronic states were negligible .",

    "in addition to the previous spectroscopic work near the bottom of the potential @xcite , vibrational energies and rotational constants extracted from the spectra were used to construct an accurate potential via dpf analysis . using the modified potential , it was possible to explain the variation in transition strengths among the vibrational levels of the @xmath2 state in terms of the fcfs .",
