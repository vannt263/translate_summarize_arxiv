    "it is usually not seriously discussed in normal textbooks on quantum mechanics about _ how to prepare an initial state_. it is , however , becoming an important subject not only from a view point of foundation of quantum mechanics , but also from a practical point of view , since we are rushing towards experimental realizations of the ideas for quantum information and computation @xcite . without establishing particular initial states assumed in several algorithms , we can not start any processes of the attractive ideas .",
    "state preparation is one of the key elements to quantum information processing @xcite , and there are several theoretical proposals @xcite and experimental attempts @xcite .    in the ideas for quantum information and computation , quantum states with high coherence , especially _ entangled states _ , play significant and essential roles . but",
    "such `` clean '' states required for quantum information technologies are not easily found in nature , since many of them are fragile against environmental perturbations and suffer from _",
    "decoherence_. therefore , there would often be a demand for preparing a desired _ pure state _ out of an arbitrary _ mixed state_. several schemes have been proposed for it , which are called `` purification , '' `` distillation , '' `` concentration , '' `` extraction , '' etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the simplest and easiest ways of state preparation is to resort to a projective measurement : a quantum system shall be in a pure state @xmath0 after it is measured and confirmed to be in the state @xmath0 .",
    "such a strategy is not possible , however , in cases where the desired state @xmath0 can not be directly measured or where the relevant system is not available after the confirmation .",
    "this is often the case for entangled states , which are the key resources to quantum information and computation .",
    "this is why more elaborate purification protocols are required and several schemes of _ entanglement purification/ preparation _ have been proposed @xcite .    recently , a novel mechanism to purify quantum states has been found and reported : _ purification through zeno - like measurements _ @xcite .",
    "a pure state is extracted in a quantum system through a series of repeated measurements ( zeno - like measurements ) on another quantum system in interaction with the former .",
    "since the relevant system to be purified is not directly measured in this scheme , it would be suitable for such situations mentioned above . in this article",
    ", we discuss this scheme in detail and explore , on a heuristic basis , its potential as a useful and effective method of purification of qubits . the examples considered here are quite simple but still possess potential and practical applicability .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "first , the basic framework of the purification is described in a general setting , and the conditions for the purification and its optimization are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] , where some details which are not discussed in the first report @xcite are included .",
    "it is then demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] how it works and how it can be made optimal in a simplest example , i.e. , _ single - qubit purification _ , and a generalization to a multi - qubit case is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : initialization ] , which would afford us a useful method of _ initialization of multiple qubits_. one of the interesting applications of the present scheme is _ entanglement purification _ , which is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : entanglementpurification ] and shown to be actually possible .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] with some comments on possible extensions and future subjects .",
    "appendices a  e are supplied in order to demonstrate detailed calculations and proofs , that are not described in the text .",
    "let us recapitulate the framework of the purification reported in @xcite .",
    "we consider two quantum systems x and a interacting with each other ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coupledsystem ] ) .        the total system x+a is initially in a _ mixed _ state @xmath1 , from which we try to extract a pure state in a by controlling x. we first perform a measurement on x ( the zeroth measurement ) _ to confirm that it is in a state @xmath2_. if it is found in the state @xmath2 , the state of the total system is projected by the projection operator @xmath3 to yield @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the state of a after this zeroth confirmation and @xmath6 is the probability for this to happen .",
    "we then let the total system start to evolve under a total hamiltonian @xmath7 and repeat the same measurement on x at regular time intervals @xmath8 .",
    "after @xmath9 repetitions of successful confirmations , i.e. , after x is confirmed to be in the state @xmath2 _ successively _ @xmath9 times , the state of the total system , @xmath10 , is cast into the following form :    [ eqn : state ] @xmath11\\\\ & = { { |{\\phi}\\rangle}_{\\text{x}}\\hspace*{-0.2truemm}{\\langle{\\phi}|}}\\otimes \\varrho_\\text{a}^{(\\tau)}(n ) , \\label{eqn : statetotal}\\displaybreak[0]\\\\ \\varrho_\\text{a}^{(\\tau)}(n ) & = \\bm{(}v_\\phi(\\tau)\\bm{)}^n\\varrho_\\text{a } \\bm{(}v_\\phi^\\dag(\\tau)\\bm{)}^n/\\tilde{p}^{(\\tau)}(n ) , \\label{eqn : statea}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 is a projected time - evolution operator acting on the hilbert space of a , and @xmath14 is the normalization factor , @xmath15 \\nonumber\\displaybreak[0]\\\\ & = { \\mathop{\\text{tr}}\\nolimits}_\\text{a}[\\bm{(}v_\\phi(\\tau)\\bm{)}^n\\varrho_\\text{a } \\bm{(}v_\\phi^\\dag(\\tau)\\bm{)}^n ] .",
    "\\label{eqn : yield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that we retain only those events where x is found in the state @xmath2 at _ every _ measurement ( including the zeroth one ) ; other events , resulting in failure to purify a , are discarded .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath14 multiplied by @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 , is nothing but the probability for the _ successful events _ and is the probability of obtaining the state given in ( [ eqn : state ] ) .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us restrict ourselves on finite - dimensional systems throughout this article and consider the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath12 .",
    "since the operator @xmath12 is not a hermitian operator , we should set up both right and left eigenvalue equations    @xmath18    the eigenvalues @xmath19 are complex in general and bounded as @xmath20 ( see appendix [ app : bound ] ) .",
    "here we assume for simplicity that the spectrum of the operator @xmath12 is not degenerate .",
    "in such a case , the eigenvectors are orthogonal to each other in the sense    @xmath21    and form a complete set in the hilbert space of system a , @xmath22    which readily leads to the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath12 , @xmath23 ( in the following , we also normalize the right eigenvectors as @xmath24 . )    even in a general situation where the spectrum of the operator @xmath12 is degenerate , the diagonalization ( [ eqn : spectraldecomp ] ) is possible when and only when all the right eigenvectors @xmath25 are linearly independent of each other and form a complete basis @xcite . otherwise , the spectral decomposition is not like ( [ eqn : spectraldecomp ] ) , but in the `` jordan canonical form '' @xcite .",
    "the diagonalizability of the operator @xmath12 is , however , not an essential assumption as clarified in appendix [ app : jordandecomposition ] .",
    "it is now easy to observe the asymptotic behavior of the state of a , @xmath26 in ( [ eqn : statea ] ) .",
    "since the eigenvalues @xmath19 are bounded like ( [ eqn : bound ] ) , each term in the expansion @xmath27 decays out and a single term dominates asymptotically as the number of measurements , @xmath9 , increases , @xmath28 _ provided _",

    "thus , the state of a in ( [ eqn : statea ] ) approaches a pure state @xmath30 , @xmath31 this is the purification scheme proposed recently @xcite : extraction of a pure state @xmath30 through a series of repeated measurements on x. since we repeat measurements ( on x ) as in the case of the quantum zeno effect @xcite , we call such measurements `` zeno - like measurements '' @xcite . the final pure state @xmath30 is the eigenstate of the projected time - evolution operator @xmath12 belonging to the largest ( in magnitude ) eigenvalue @xmath32 and depends on the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath2 , and those in the hamiltonian @xmath7 .",
    "it is , however , independent of the initial state @xmath1 .",
    "the pure state @xmath33 is extracted from an _ arbitrary _ mixed state @xmath1 through the zeno - like measurements . by tuning such parameters mentioned above",
    ", we have a possibility of extracting a desired pure state @xmath30 .",
    "the above observation shows that the assumption of the diagonalizability in ( [ eqn : spectraldecomp ] ) is not essential but condition ( [ eqn : condition ] ) , i.e. , the existence of the _",
    "unique , discrete and nondegenerate largest ( in magnitude ) eigenvalue @xmath32 _ , is crucial to the purification . for our purification mechanism to work ,",
    "it is crucial that a single state is extracted and this is accomplished when these qualifications , i.e. , the uniqueness of the largest eigenvalue and the nondegeneracy of the eigenvector , are both met .",
    "the diagonalizability of @xmath12 is not relevant to these conditions and is not essential to the purification .",
    "this point is clarified in appendix [ app : jordandecomposition ] .",
    "furthermore , note the asymptotic behavior of the success probability @xmath34 : it decays asymptotically as @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the decay is governed by the eigenvalue @xmath32 , and therefore , an efficient purification is possible if @xmath32 satisfies the condition @xmath39 which suppresses the decay in ( [ eqn : decay ] ) to give the final ( nonvanishing ) success probability @xmath40 it is worth stressing that the condition ( [ eqn : optimizationi ] ) allows us to repeat the measurement as many times as we wish without running the risk of losing the success probability @xmath34 . in other words , high fidelity to the target state and nonvanishing success probability do not contradict each other in this scheme , but rather they can be achieved simultaneously . at the same time , if the other eigenvalues are much smaller than @xmath32 in magnitude , @xmath41 purification is achieved quickly . equations ( [ eqn : optimizationi ] ) and ( [ eqn : optimizationii ] ) are the conditions for the _ optimal purification _ , which we try to accomplish by adjusting parameters @xmath8 , @xmath2 , and those in the hamiltonian @xmath7 .    in the following sections , we discuss the above purification scheme in more detail addressing a few specific examples , which are so simple but",
    "still possess potential and practical applications in quantum information and computation .",
    "let us first observe how the above mechanism works in the simplest example : we consider two qubits ( two two - level systems ) x and a interacting with each other , whose total hamiltonian is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the pauli operators , @xmath44 are the ladder operators , and the frequencies @xmath45 and the coupling constant @xmath46 are real parameters .",

    "( iii ) the number of measurements required for purification is considerably reduced by appropriate choices of parameters , and purification is attainable after only a few steps .",
    "another point to be stressed is the flexibility .",
    "while many of the other schemes @xcite are designed for specific systems , the framework is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : framework ] on a general setting , and there are diverse systems and purposes which fit the present scheme .",
    "we have already observed , in this article , two different applications on the same idea : initialization and entanglement purification .",
    "additional ideas or slight modifications to the basic scheme would provide us with various methods of state preparation .",
    "an interesting extension of the present scheme is for extraction of entanglement _ between two spatially - separated qubits _",
    "@xcite , which is often necessary for quantum communication , quantum teleportation , and so on .",
    "( the original protocols for entanglement purification @xcite are aimed at this purpose . )",
    "it is actually possible and will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one of the other possible extensions is to go beyond a method of extracting quantum state .",
    "it would be interesting , for example , if we could find a novel method of _ transferring _ quantum state @xcite rather than extracting it .    in this article , only qubit systems , i.e. , finite - dimensional systems ,",
    "have been discussed .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the condition ( [ eqn : condition ] ) plays a crucial role in the present purification scheme .",
    "if this condition is met , however , it works for infinite - dimensional ones as well .",
    "in fact , a harmonic oscillator , which has an infinite number of energy levels , can be purified through the present method , which is explicitly demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "this also shows the broad range of applicability of the scheme .",
    "it is not obvious , however , whether one can purify systems with continuous spectra , since they seem , at first sight , unlikely to satisfy the condition for purification ( [ eqn : condition ] ) , especially the discreteness of the eigenvalues .",
    "this point is one of the interesting future subjects , since it would be required in some cases to purify quantum states in the presence of environmental systems , namely , under dissipation and/or dephasing .",
    "the simplicity and the efficiency mentioned above would facilitate practical experimental applications of the present scheme .",
    "the flexibility allows one to apply it to various kinds of systems intended for quantum information and computation , such as optical setups @xcite , ion - trap systems @xcite , solid - state quantum computers @xcite , and so on . in practice , one should face many unwanted factors , and robustness of the method against them is crucial . in the present scheme ,",
    "it is often required to tune certain parameters in order to extract a desired pure state , and it is an important subject to clarify how precise the tuning should be and how much error the method suffers from when the parameters are mistuned .",
    "it is also a remained issue to explore how ideal projective measurements are realized in actual experiments .",
