    "the study of finance largely concerns about the trade - off between risk and expected return . a significant source of risk in financial market",
    "is the uncertainty of the volatility of equity indices , where volatility is understood as the standard deviation of a financial instrument s return with a specific time horizon . in late 1990s ,",
    "wall street firms started trading volatility derivatives such as variance swaps .",
    "since then , these derivatives have become a preferred route for many hedge fund managers to trade on market volatility . due to the crucial role that volatility plays in making investment decisions , it is important for financial practitioners to understand the nature of the volatility variations .",
    "research on volatility derivatives has been an active pursued topic in quantitative finance .",
    "researchers working in the field concerning volatility derivatives have been focusing on developing suitable methods for evaluating variance swaps .",
    "carr and madan @xcite combined static replication using options with dynamic trading in futures to price and hedge certain volatility contracts without specifying the volatility process .",
    "the principal assumptions were continuous trading and continuous semi - martingale price processes for the future prices .",
    "demeterfi et al .",
    "@xcite worked in the same area by proving that a variance swap could be reproduced via a portfolio of standard options .",
    "the requirements were continuity of exercise prices for the options and continuous sampling time for the variance swaps .",
    "one common feature shared among these researches was the assumption of continuous sampling time which was actually an simplification of the discrete sampling reality in financial markets .",
    "in fact , options of discretely - sampled variance swaps were mis - valued when the continuous sampling was used as approximation , and large inaccuracies occurred in certain sampling periods , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned analytical approaches , some other authors also conducted researches using numerical approaches .",
    "little and pant @xcite explored the finite - difference method via dimension - reduction approach and obtained high efficiency and accuracy for discretely - sampled variance swaps .",
    "windcliff et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of employing the partial - integro differential equation on constant volatility , local volatility and jump diffusion - based volatility products .",
    "an extension of the approach in @xcite was made by zhu and lian in @xcite through incorporating heston two - factor stochastic volatility for pricing discretely - sampled variance swaps .",
    "another recent study was conducted by bernard and cui @xcite on analytical and asymptotic results for discrete sampling variance swaps with three different stochastic volatility models .",
    "their cholesky decomposition technique exhibited significant simplification .",
    "however , the constant interest rate assumption by the authors did not reflect the real market phenomena .",
    "one of the contemporary developments in the financial research was the emergence of hybrid models , which described interactions between different asset classes such as stock , interest rate and volatility .",
    "the main aim of these models was to provide customized alternatives for market practitioners and financial institutions , as well as reducing the associated risks of the underlying assets .",
    "hybrid models could be generally categorized into two different types , namely hybrid models with full correlation and hybrid models with partial correlation among engaged underlyings .",
    "literatures concerning hybrid models with partial correlation among asset classes appeared to dominate the field due to less complexity involved .",
    "majority of the researchers focused on either inducing correlation between the stock and interest rate , or between the stock and the volatility .",
    "grunbichler and longstaff @xcite developed pricing model for options on variance based on the heston stochastic volatility model . @xcite and @xcite stressed that correlation between equity and interest rate was crucial to ensure that the pricing activities were precise , especially for industrial practice .",
    "according to these authors , the correlation effects between equity and interest rate were more distinct compared to the correlation effects between interest rate and volatility .",
    "the hybrid models with full correlation among underlyings started to attract attention for their improved model capability . @xcite and",
    "@xcite compared their heston - hull - white hybrid model with the szhw hybridization for pricing inflation dependent options and european options , respectively .    in this article",
    "we develop the modeling framework which extends the heston stochastic volatility model by including the stochastic interest rate which follows the cir process .",
    "note that @xcite derived an semi - analytical pricing formula for partially correlated heston - cir hybrid model of discretely - sampled variance swaps .",
    "their suggestion of imposing full correlation among state variables is considered in this work .",
    "our focus is on the pricing of discrete sampling variance swaps with full correlation among equity , interest rate as well as volatility .",
    "since the heston - cir model hybridization is not affine , we approach the pricing problem via the hybrid model approximation which fits in the class of affine diffusion models @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient involves the derivation of characteristic functions for two phases of partial differential equations and we obtain a semi - closed form pricing formula for variance swaps .",
    "numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the accuracy of the pricing formula .",
    "in this section we present a hybrid model which combines the heston stochastic volatility model with the one - factor cir stochastic interest rate model .",
    "our model extends the work in @xcite by imposing full correlation among the underling asset , volatility and interest rate .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a model which was a combination of the multi - scale stochastic volatility model and the hull - white interest rate model and showed that incorporation of the stochastic interest rate process into the stochastic volatility model gave better results compared with the constant interest rate case in any maturity .      given @xmath0 , let @xmath1 be the stochastic process of some asset price with the time horizon @xmath2 $ ] .",

    "in contrast to the significant correlation effects of @xmath147 in figure 2 , smaller impact of @xmath148 is observed .",
    "in fact , the variance swap rates for three different values of @xmath148 are almost the same .",
