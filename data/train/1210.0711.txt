    "the study of localized surface plasmon ( lsp ) resonances over the last couple of decades has led to great advances in several areas of science and technology .",
    "probably , its most significant application is its use in nanosensors.@xcite most of the strategies used to turn a plasmonic device into a sensor are based on the shift of the resonant position of the lsp@xcite or in exploiting hot spots to increase spectroscopic signals.@xcite in this respect , there is a growing interest in using interacting plasmonic systems to measure distances at the nanoscale .",
    "these devices are known as nanorulers and they are finding interesting applications in several fields such as biology.@xcite most of the proposed plasmonic rulers work by the same principle , the shift of a resonance induced by the variation of a distance . as noticed originally by jain et .",
    "al.,@xcite the frequency shift of the lsp resonance follows an almost universal exponential or quasi - exponential law with respect to the separation between nps .",
    "this behavior is known as the universal plasmon ruler equation ( upre ) and was observed in simulations and experiments using nps of different size and shape,@xcite core - shell nps,@xcite and even two dimensional arrays of nps.@xcite there are some deviations of the upre due to retardation effects or the effects of higher order multipoles , but they can usually be corrected by empirical fittings.@xcite only when nps are almost touching each other , there are some deviations , nonfitable to exponential , of the upre.@xcite there is another kind of plasmon rulers that is now being actively investigated .",
    "they are based on a different principle , the fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) .",
    "its working principle is the resonant transference of excitation from a fluorescent molecule to a nearby np .",
    "the closer to fluorophore to the np , the greater the photoluminescence quenching .",
    "this effect has been successfully used as a nanorulers in several experimental examples.@xcite    collective effects induced by lsp couplings in nps arrays can give rise to other phenomena and new potential applications.@xcite one example is the use of fano resonances to design plasmonic sensors.@xcite in this case , the shift of very sharp peaks or valleys in the extinction spectrum , consequence of collective effects of interacting nps , have been proposed to measure distances or the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium.@xcite more exotic applications of nps coupling are also possible and many of them are now being actively explored , such as clocking by metamaterials or plasmonics circuitry.@xcite    although , linear arrays of metallic nps have been proposed as potential waveguides to transfer massive amounts of information at the nanoscale,@xcite nowadays it is clear that high damping factors would impose severe limits to that and most of the effort in this field is being put on overcoming this limitation . however , one important and very general feature of 1-d systems , which seems to have been overlooked in plasmonics , is the extreme sensitivity of their dynamical properties to slight changes of their parameters . in this respect ,",
    "we have previously studied the plasmonics energy transfer from a locally excited np ( le - np ) , the 0th np in the scheme shown in [ figure-1 ] , to the interior of a semi - infinite np chain.@xcite this system presents a form of dynamical phase transition ( dpt ) , a phenomenon that is currently attracting interest as source of novel effects on various fields.@xcite basically a dpt in this context means that by sightly moving a single parameter , such as the shape of the nps or the distance between them , the system undergoes an abrupt transition from transferring all the injected excitation to the interior of the np array ( a delocalized state ) , to keeping all the external excitation in the nps closer to the excitation point ( a localized state).@xcite the aim of this work is to exploit this basic property into a realistic setting , in order to design a new kind of excitation - transfer plasmonic nanosensor ( etps ) .",
    "the system studied , depicted in [ figure-1 ] , is modeled using the coupled dipole approximation .",
    "@xcite in this model , each @xmath0-np is described by a dipole @xmath1 induced by the electric field produced by the other dipoles , @xmath2 , and the external source , @xmath3 .",
    "we assume a generic ellipsoidal shape for the metallic nps and describe its polarizabilities in a quasi - static approximation,@xcite resulting in : @xmath4 } \\left ( e_{i}^{(\\mathrm{ext})}+\\sum\\limits_{j\\neq i}e_{i , j } \\right ) \\label{pvector},\\]]where @xmath5 is the volume , @xmath6 is a geometrical factor that depends on the shape of the np and the direction of @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the free space permittivity , and @xmath9 is the dielectric constant of the host medium around the @xmath10-th np . the dielectric constants @xmath11 of the nps are described by a drude - sommerfeld model : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the plasmon frequency , @xmath14 is the electronic damping factor , and @xmath15 is a material dependent constant that take into account the contribution of the bound electrons to the polarizability . the lsp oscillations over each np can only be transverse ( @xmath16 ) or longitudinal ( @xmath6 ) to the axis of the linear array and we assume , for simplicity , that the ellipsoids axes are aligned with respect to these @xmath16 and @xmath6 directions .",
    "if the excitation wavelength is large compared with the separation between nps , @xmath2 can be taken in the near field approximation , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the distance between nps .",
    "taking into account these considerations , @xmath1 and @xmath3 can be arranged as vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 resulting in:@xcite @xmath23where @xmath24 is the dynamical matrix and @xmath25 is a diagonal matrix that rescales the external applied field according to local properties : @xmath26with @xmath27 } { \\left[\\epsilon _ { m , i}+l_{i}(\\epsilon_{\\infty}-\\epsilon _ { m , i})\\right]}$ ] .    because of the cubic dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath20 , we neglect contributions beyond nearest neighbors,@xcite resulting in a tridiagonal @xmath24 . for nps belonging to the chain , @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and for the le - np ,  @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . the lsp frequencies @xmath34 and coupling constants @xmath35 , result : @xmath36 } , \\label{omegasp}\\ ] ] @xmath37 for spherical nps ( @xmath38 ) in vacuum ( @xmath39 ) within a drude - sommerfeld model which completely neglects contribution from bound electrons ( @xmath40 ) , eqs .",
    "[ matrixp]-[omegax ] reduce to the simple form used in several references.@xcite this shows the meaning of @xmath41 , which essentially collects the deviations from the ideal model of spherical np in vacuum with @xmath42 , not only for @xmath43 but also for couplings between nps .",
    "note that these deviations reduce to a constant for @xmath44 and/or small excitation frequencies @xmath41 ( strictly for @xmath45 \\ll \\omega_{_{\\mathrm{p}i}}^{2}/ [ \\epsilon_{\\infty}-\\epsilon_{m , i}]$ ] ) .",
    "the form of eqs .",
    "[ matrixp]-[omegax ] not only extends our previous expressions@xcite to non - spherical nps but also includes explicitly the interdependencies of @xmath35 , @xmath46 , and @xmath43 with the parameters of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ size , shape , and material of nps , distances between nps , and dielectric constants .",
    "it should also be mentioned that although this model can be further improved , the different corrections will only add quantitative corrections as long as the essential physics of the problem remains , _",
    "i.e. _ a semi - infinite chain with nearest neighbors interactions.@xcite we will analyze this point in more detail in the last section .    in the present work we will consider the case of excitation injection to a semi - infinte homogeneous linear array of nps , where solely the le - np can be different from the rest and",
    "the only nonidentical separation is that between the le - np and the first np of the chain .",
    "therefore , there will be two lsp resonances , that of the le - np @xmath47 and that of the chain s nps @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , the couplings between the chain s nps will be all the same @xmath49 .",
    "the couplings between the le - np and the first np of the chain are @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "they are not necessarily equal ( see eq .",
    "[ omegax ] ) , since they describe quite different situations , _",
    "i.e. _ how @xmath52 affects @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) and how @xmath53 affects @xmath52 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the values of the resonance frequency @xmath48 and the couplings @xmath55 can be tuned in different ways .",
    "however , one must be careful because they are always interrelated .",
    "for example , choosing a different material for the nps will change both @xmath56 and @xmath57 and therefore @xmath55 and @xmath48 . changing",
    "the shape of the nps will modify @xmath6 and consequently @xmath55 and @xmath48 , except for @xmath58 in which case it will only modify @xmath48 .",
    "the volume and distances between nps will change @xmath55 .",
    "if the material , size and shape of nps are fixed , the free parameters that can be used for sensing purposes are the dielectric constant of the medium @xmath59 that alter both @xmath60 and @xmath55 , and the distances between nps that change couplings .    the values of @xmath49 and @xmath48 define the passband which is the interval of frequencies at which an excitation can propagate with only a relatively small decay , given by @xmath14 , through the waveguide formed by the linear array of nps .",
    "all excitations with frequencies @xmath61 outside the passband will decay along the chain exponentially and very fast . in the weak damping limit ( wdl )",
    "@xmath62 , this passband is given by a simple expression , @xmath63 .",
    "this fact shows one of the roles of the chain : to determine which frequencies can be propagated .",
    "the other role is to perturb the local density of plasmonic states ( ldps ) of the le - np by pushing the resonance from its uncoupled value at @xmath47 to the nearest edge of the passband.@xcite this process occurs very abruptly when the resonance is about to cross the passband edge that is when the dynamics of the system changes completely.@xcite    this phenomenon can be completely understood in terms of the divergences , or poles , of eq .",
    "[ matrixp ] in the wdl.@xcite basically there are three different dynamical regimes of interest for excitation transfer : 1 ) _ delocalized _ or _ resonant _ state regime , where the maximum of ldps of the le - np falls within the passband and most of the excitation can be transferred to the np array ; 2 ) _ localized _ state regime where there is a very sharp peak in the ldps outside the passband and most of the excitation remains close to the excitation point ; and 3 ) a transition regime called _ virtual _ state where the ldps presents a non - lorentzian asymmetric peak just at the passband edge and most of the excitation can be transferred to the waveguide .",
    "the transitions between the different dynamical regimes can be obtained analytically in the wdl and assuming frequency independent couplings , where:@xcite @xmath64 gives the _ resonant - virtual _ transition and : @xmath65 gives the _ virtual - localized _ transition , where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "the constant @xmath69 is the relative coupling between le - np and first np of the chain in units of the coupling in the chain , @xmath70 yields the difference in resonance frequency of the le - np with respect to that of a chain s np , and @xmath71 measures the strength of the coupling between chain s nps in units of their own resonance frequency .",
    "these formulas , although strictly valid only in the wdl , give an excellent estimation for finites @xmath14s.@xcite    the excitation transferred from the le - np to the _",
    "m_-th np of the chain can be calculated exactly ( in the quasi - static limit and within the nearest - neighbors approximation ) by using the formula:@xcite @xmath72 -\\alpha \\pi ( \\omega ) \\right ) } e^{-m ( l \\pm iq ) } , \\label{pm}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the electric field on the le - np and the renormalized eigen - frequency @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 .",

    "we have chosen @xmath84 , because around this value the behavior of @xmath81 vs @xmath85 becomes essentially a small decaying exponential for all @xmath61 within the passband or zero for excitation frequencies outside it .",
    "thus , choosing a bigger value of @xmath85 would only add a multiplicative factor to the results , _",
    "i.e. _ it would not change qualitatively the figures shown .",
    "in this work , our purpose is to show how to use the sudden change in the dynamical properties of systems tuned around their dpt to device etpss . for this purpose",
    ", we used the system depicted in [ figure-1 ] as an example .",
    "[ figure-2 ] shows the maximum excitation transferred to a np of the waveguide , @xmath86 enabled by a variation of the excitation frequency @xmath61 , at each system configuration .",
    "superposed are the critical values that separates dynamically distinct behaviors calculated in the wdl ( eqs .",
    "[ alfac1 ] and [ alfac2 ] ) .",
    "as it has been previously reported,@xcite excitation transfer is controlled by the dpt where _ virtual _ states are transformed into _",
    "localized _ states ( gray dashed lines ) .",
    "@xmath87{figure-3a.eps } \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figure-3b.eps}\\end{array}$ ]    analyzing the phase diagram of [ figure-2 ] it is clear that the strong dependence of excitation transfer to the system s parameters can be used for different forms of sensors . as a first application of this , lets us analyze the potentiality of this plasmonic device as a plasmon ruler . in [ figure-2 ]",
    "a vertical displacement corresponds to a variation of the distance between the le - np and the chain .",
    "the vertical blue arrow indicates an example of a region in the parameters space that can be used for such a purpose .",
    "for each point along this arrow the system depicts a different excitation transfer spectrum .",
    "three representative points along this line , at @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , are used in [ figure-3]-*a * ) to illustrate how the spectrum of excitation transfer changes when the system undergoes a dpt .",
    "note the abrupt change in the spectra induced by a slight change of @xmath91 : the excitation transfer suddenly increases at @xmath92 when @xmath91 varies from @xmath90 to @xmath89 , and then decreases equally abruptly when @xmath91 change from @xmath89 to @xmath93 .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the _ virtual - localized _ dpt , indicated in [ figure-2 ] by the curved gray dashed lines and predicted by eqs .",
    "[ alfac1 ] and [ alfac2 ] .",
    "one of the interesting aspects of this new form of plasmonic ruler is that the variation of a distance not merely modifies the position of a peak but dramatically changes the whole spectrum , and quite remarkably , before and after the dpt , only negligible signals should be observed independently of the excitation frequency . in this sense , our excitation transfer nanoruler could be used as a robust nanometric standard .",
    "this is so , because , in order to observe a difference in the excitation transferred , it is not required a high accuracy in the excitation frequency nor a monochromatic light but keeping the maximum of the excitation frequency close to the lower band edge frequency , in our example at @xmath94 , is a sufficient condition .",
    "furthermore , if the polarization has two components one transversal , @xmath16 , and one longitudinal @xmath95 , this should not interfere in a sensor tuned to work with only one of them .",
    "this is so , because the passband of @xmath16 modes are half of @xmath6 modes , eq .",
    "[ omegax ] , which imply that regions in the spectrum where dpts can be observed , should be well separated .",
    "moreover , according to eqs .",
    "[ alfac1 ] and [ alfac2 ] , dpts should occur for different values of system s parameters .",
    "another important aspect is that the detection could be performed in a region encompassing several nps .",
    "this is so , because , except for the first nps of the chain , the excitation transferred to the chain is an exponential function of np position @xmath85 , see eq .",
    "thus , the main feature of this kind of nanorulers is its robust _ on _ and _ off _ feature , _",
    "i.e. _ signals should only be detected when the le - np is at a very precise and predetermined distance .",
    "@xmath87{figure-4a.eps } \\\\ \\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figure-4b.eps}\\end{array}$ ]    etps could also be used for sensing other properties , not only as plasmon nanorulers . as",
    "shown in [ figure-2 ] , the system is also very sensitive to the value of the square frequency offset ( sfo = @xmath96 ) and consequently to @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and/or @xmath49 .",
    "increasing the numerator of the sfo or decreasing its denominator , will both move the sfo away from the center of [ figure-2 ] as indicated by the horizontal green arrow .",
    "[ figure-3]-*b * ) shows the excitation transfer spectrum for three values of sfo along this green arrow .",
    "similarly to the nanoruler case , the spectrum experiences a significant change when moving the sfo along a dpt , from @xmath99 to @xmath100 . in order to show how to make profit of this feature we will consider two examples : one in which contraction or expansion of the whole system is measured , and one in which local dielectric constant around the le - np is measured .",
    "[ figure-4]-*a * shows , for a fixed excitation frequency , @xmath94 , the relative increment of the excitation transferred , @xmath101 , as a function of the relative expansion / contraction of the whole system , which turns our device into an optical strain monitor@xcite or even into a temperature sensor , depending on the expansion coefficient of the host material .",
    "note that a relative expansion / contraction of the whole system corresponds to a change in @xmath102 but not in @xmath103 , @xmath104 , nor in @xmath105 .",
    "thus it is equivalent to an horizontal displacement in [ figure-2 ] .",
    "[ figure-4]-*b * shows the variation of the relative increment of the excitation transferred as a function of the local dielectric constant around the le - np , a property potentially useful for molecular sensing purposes for example.@xcite in this case , a variation of @xmath106 changes not only @xmath107 but also @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( eqs . [ rii]-[omegax ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is equivalent to a diagonal displacement in [ figure-2 ] and a rescaling of the external applied field .",
    "the key ingredients from which the phenomenology described so far arise are : dominant nearest - neighbors interactions and the semi - infinite character of the system .",
    "if this conditions are fulfilled , the results presented above should be applicable to the system under consideration besides quantitative corrections such as shifts of the spectra or the exact position of dpts in the parameter s phase space .",

    ", we will study the effect of interactions beyond nearest - neighbors and retardation effects . in this case , eq .",
    "[ pvector ] is still valid but all coupling between nps should be considered , _",

    "we use here a slightly smaller coupling than that of the previous section for reasons that will become clear in the context of [ figure-5 ] . as before ,",
    "the observation point is fixed at the 8th np , and we use the value of @xmath139 as an indicator of the excitation transferred to the chain . due to the large interparticle coupling , finite size effects result so important , especially near the lowest band edge , that it is necessary to take very long size of chains .",
    "we use 200 nps , a value large enough to ensure negligible finite size effects .     in arbitrary units , as function of @xmath140 for @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",

    "the first effect of this is essentially a red - shift and a broadening of the passband .",
    "the second effect is that the dpt is also shifted from @xmath141 to @xmath144 as can be seen in [ figure-6]-a .",
    "however , it is still present and indeed , as the damping term is proportional to the frequency , the peak is increased .",
    "note that if @xmath82 were used , the peak would disappear from the spectrum as it would be located at @xmath145 , showing an important effect of higher - order contributions to interactions . in [ figure-6]-a and b retardation effects on the dpt are compared . here",
    ", retardation causes nothing else but an increase of the intensity of the peak , in the region of the spectrum where the dpt is observable .",

    "note that even after including all contribution to the interaction among nps and retardation effects , @xmath81 still decays exponentially as predicted by the theory , although the decay rate is different mainly because the passband edge is considerably shifted .",
    "in this work we have studied the potentiality for sensing purposes of the excitation transferred from a le - np to the interior of a semi - infinite np chain , when the system is very close to its dpt condition .",
    "while most plasmonic sensors use the shift of the lsp resonance peaks or the photoluminescence quenching of hybrid plasmonic - fluorophores systems , here we introduce a new working principle .",
    "basically , the idea is to take advantage of the abrupt change in the plasmonic energy transferred when a control parameter is slightly changed around a dpt .",
    "we have shown that this kind of sensor has the unique characteristic of having an _ on - off _ switching property and a high sensitivity , which opens new possibilities to design plasmonic devices such as plasmonic circuits activated only under certain environmental conditions .",
    "we have also addressed the effects of different corrections to the approximations used and have shown that if the system s parameters are chosen properly , the dpt should be observable and therefore useful for the sensing purposes .",
