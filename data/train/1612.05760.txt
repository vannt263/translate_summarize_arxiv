    "in a prescient 1929 novel called _ lncszemek _ ( in english , _ chains _ ) , karinthy imagines that any two people can be connected by a small chain of personal links , using no more than _ five _ intermediaries  @xcite .",
    "years later , milgram validates the concept by conducting real - life experiments .",
    "he asks volunteers to transmit a letter to an acquaintance with the objective to reach a target destination across the united states  @xcite .",
    "while not all messages arrive , successful attempts reach destination after six hops in average , popularizing the notion of _ six degrees of separation_.    yet , for a long time , no theoretical model could explain why and how this kind of _ small - world _ routing works .",
    "one of the first and most famous attempts to provide such a model is due to jon kleinberg @xcite .",
    "he proposes to abstract the social network by a grid augmented with _",
    "shortcuts_. if the shortcuts follow a heavy tail distribution with a specific exponent , then a simple greedy routing can reach any destination in a short time ( @xmath0 hops ) . on the other hand , if the exponent is wrong , then the time to reach destination becomes @xmath1 for some @xmath2 .",
    "this seminal work has led to multiple studies from both the theoretical and empirical social systems communities .      in this paper , we propose a new way to numerically benchmark the greedy routing algorithm in the original model introduced by kleinberg .",
    "our approach uses dynamic rejection sampling , which gives a substantial speed improvement compared to previous attempts , without making any concession about the assumptions made in the original model , which is kept untouched .    fueled by the capacity to obtain quick and accurate results even for very large grids ,",
    "we give a fresh look on kleinberg s grid , through three independent small studies .",
    "first , we show that the model is in practice more robust than expected : for grids of given size there is quite a large range of exponents that grant short routing paths .",
    "then we observe that the lower bounds proposed by kleinberg in @xcite are not tight and suggest new bounds .",
    "finally , we compare kleinberg s grid to milgram s experiment , and observe that when the grid parameters are correctly tuned , the performance of greedy routing is consistent with the _ six degrees of separation _ phenomenon .",
    "section [ sec : related - work ] presents the original augmented grid model introduced by kleinberg and the greedy routing algorithm .",
    "a brief overview of the main existing theoretical and experimental studies is provided , with a strong emphasis on the techniques that can be used for the numerical evaluation of kleinberg s model .    in section [ sec : simulation - design ] , we give our algorithm for estimating the performance of greedy routing .",
    "we explain the principle of dynamic rejection sampling and detail why it allows to perfectly emulate kleinberg s grid with the same speed that can be achieved by toroidal approximations .",
    "we also give a performance evaluation of the simulator based on our solution . for readers interested in looking under the hood , a fully working code ( written in julia )",
    "is given in appendix [ sec : code ] .",
    "to show the algorithm benefits , we propose in section [ sec : applications ] three small studies that investigate kleinberg s model from three distinct perspectives : robustness of greedy routing with respect to the shortcut distribution ( section [ sec : efficient - enough - exponents ] ) ; tightness of the existing theoretical bounds ( section [ sec : asymptotic - behavior ] ) ; emulation of milgram s experiment within kleinberg s model ( section [ sec : six - degrees - of - separation ] ) .",
    "we present here the model and notation introduced by kleinberg in  @xcite , some key results , and a brief overview of the subsequent work on the matter .      in @xcite",
    ", kleinberg considers a model of directed random graph @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are positive integers and @xmath5 is a non - negative real number . a graph instance is built from a square lattice of @xmath6 nodes with manhattan distance @xmath7 : if @xmath8 and @xmath9 , then @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath7 represents some natural proximity ( geographic , social ,  ) between nodes .",
    "each node has some _ local _ neighbors and @xmath11 _ long range _ neighbors .",
    "the local neighbors of a node @xmath12 are the nodes @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath11 long range neighbors of @xmath12 , also called _ shortcuts _ , are drawn independently and identically as follows : the probability that a given long edge starting from @xmath12 arrives in @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the problem of decentralized routing in a @xmath3 instance consists in delivering a message from node @xmath12 to node @xmath13 in a hop - by - hop basis . at each step , the message bearer needs to choose the next hop among its neighbors .",
    "the decision can only use the lattice coordinates of the neighbors and destination .",
    "the main example of decentralized algorithm is the _ greedy routing _",
    ", where at each step , the current node chooses the neighbor that is closest to destination based on @xmath7 ( in case of ties , an arbitrary breaking rule is used ) .",
    "the main metric to analyze the performance of a decentralized algorithm is the _ expected delivery time _ , which is the expected number of hops to transmit a message between two nodes chosen uniformly at random in the graph .",
    "this paper focuses on studying the performance of the greedy algorithm . unless stated otherwise",
    ", we assume @xmath16 ( each node has up to four local neighbors and one shortcut ) . let @xmath17 be the expected delivery time of the greedy algorithm in @xmath18 .",
    "the main theoretical results for the genuine model are provided in the original papers  @xcite , where kleinberg proves the following :    * @xmath19 ; * for @xmath20 , the expected delivery time of any decentralized algorithm is @xmath21 ; * for @xmath22 , the expected delivery time of any decentralized algorithm is @xmath23 .",
    "kleinberg s results are often interpreted as follows : short paths are easy to find only in the case @xmath24 .",
    "the fact that only one value of @xmath5 asymptotically works is sometimes seen as the sign that kleinberg s model is not robust enough to explain the small - world routing proposed by karinthy and experimented by milgram . however , as briefly discussed by kleinberg in @xcite , there is in fact some margin if one considers a grid of given @xmath25 .",
    "this tolerance will be investigated in more details in section [ sec : efficient - enough - exponents ] .",
    "while we focus here on the original model , let us give a brief , non - exhaustive , overview of the subsequent extensions that have been proposed since .",
    "most proposals refine the model by considering other graph models or other decentralized routing algorithms .",
    "new graph models are for example variants of the original model ( studying grid dimension or the number of shortcuts per node @xcite ) , graphs inspired by peer - to - peer overlay networks @xcite , or arbitrary graphs augmented with shortcuts  @xcite",
    ". other proposals of routing algorithms usually try to enhance the performance of the greedy one by granting the current node additional knowledge of the topology @xcite .",
    "a large part of the work above aims at improving the @xmath0 bound of the greedy routing .",
    "for example , in the small - world percolation model , a variant of kleinberg s grid with @xmath26 shortcuts per node , greedy routing performs in @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "many empirical studies have been made to study how routing works in real - life social networks and the possible relation with kleinberg s model ( see for example @xcite and the references within ) .",
    "on the other hand , numerical evaluations of the theoretical models are more limited to the best of our knowledge .",
    "such evaluations are usually performed by averaging @xmath27 runs of the routing algorithm considered .    in @xcite , kleinberg computes @xmath17 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 $ ] , using 1,000 runs per estimate .",
    "however , he uses a torus instead of a regular grid ( this will be discussed later in the paper ) . in @xcite ,",
    "networks of size up to @xmath30 ( corresponding to @xmath31 in the grid ) are investigated using 150 runs per estimate .",
    "closer to our work , athanassopoulos _ et al .",
    "_ propose a study centered on numerical evaluation that looks on kleinberg s model and some variants @xcite .",
    "for the former , they differ from the original model by having fixed source and destination nodes .",
    "they compute @xmath17 for values of @xmath25 up to 3,000 and @xmath32 , using 900 runs per estimate .    to compare with , in the present paper , we consider values of @xmath25 up to @xmath33 and @xmath34 $ ] , with at least 10,000 runs per estimate .",
    "to explain such a gain , we first need to introduce the issue of shortcuts computation .      as stated in @xcite , the main computational bottleneck for simulating kleinberg s model comes from the shortcuts .",
    "* there are @xmath35 shortcuts in the grid ( assuming @xmath36 ) ; * when one wants to a shortcut , any of the @xmath37 other nodes can be chosen with non - null probability .",
    "this can be made by inverse transform sampling , with a cost @xmath38 ; * the shortcut distribution depends on the node @xmath12 considered , even if one uses relative coordinates .",
    "for example , a corner node will have @xmath39 neighbors at distance @xmath40 for @xmath41 , against @xmath42 neighbors for inner nodes ( as long as the ball of radius @xmath40 stays inside the grid ) .",
    "this means that , up to symmetry , each node has a unique shortcut distribution distinct ( non - isomorphic ) distributions . ] .",
    "this prevents from mutualising shortcuts drawings between nodes .    in the end ,",
    "building shortcuts as described above for each of the @xmath27 runs has a time complexity @xmath43 , which is unacceptable if one wants to evaluate @xmath17 on large grids .",
    "the first issue is easy to address : as observed in @xcite , we can use the _ principle of deferred decision _  @xcite and compute the shortcuts on - the - fly as the path is built , because they are drawn independently and a node is never used twice in a given path .",
    "this reduces the complexity to @xmath44 .      to lower the complexity even more",
    ", one can approximate the grid by the torus .",
    "this is the approach adopted in @xcite .",
    "the toroidal topology brings two major features compared to a flat grid :    * the distribution of the relative position of the shortcut does not depend on the originating node .",
    "this enables to draw shortcuts in advance ( in bulk ) ; * there is a strong radial symmetry , allowing to draw a `` radius '' and an `` angle '' separately .    to illustrate the gain of using a torus instead of a grid , consider the drawing of @xmath45 shortcuts from @xmath45 distinct nodes . in a grid ,",
    "if one uses inverse transform sampling for each corresponding distribution , the cost is @xmath46 . in the torus",
    ", one can compute the probabilities to be at distance @xmath40 for @xmath40 between @xmath47 and @xmath25 ( the maximal distance in the torus ) , draw @xmath45 radii , then choose for each drawn radius @xmath40 a node uniformly chosen among those at distance @xmath40 . assuming drawing a float uniformly distributed over @xmath48 can be made in @xmath49 , the main bottleneck is the drawing of radii . using bulk",
    "inverse transform sampling , it can be performed in @xmath50 , by sorting @xmath45 random floats , matching then against the cumulative distribution of radii and reverse sorting the result .",
    "we now describe our approach for computing @xmath17 in the flat grid with the same complexity than for the torus approximation .      in order to keep low computational complexity without making any approximation of the model",
    ", we propose to draw a shortcut of a node @xmath12 as follows :    1 .",
    "we embed the actual grid @xmath51 ( we use here @xmath51 to refer to the lattice nodes of @xmath3 ) in a virtual lattice @xmath52 made of points inside a ball of radius @xmath53 .",
    "note that the radius chosen ensures that @xmath51 is included in @xmath52 no matter the location of @xmath12 .",
    "we draw a node inside @xmath52 such that the probability to pick up a node @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "this can be done in two steps ( radius and angle ) : * for the radius , we notice that the probability to draw a node at distance @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath54 , so we pick an integer between @xmath47 and @xmath53 such that the probability to draw @xmath40 is to @xmath55 .",
    "* for the angle , pick an integer uniformly chosen between 1 and @xmath42 3 .",
    "this determines a unique point @xmath13 among the @xmath42 points at distance @xmath40 from @xmath12 in the virtual lattice , chosen with a probability proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath13 belongs to the actual grid , it becomes the shortcut , otherwise we try again ( back to step # 2 ) .",

    ", it gives the correct distribution : the node @xmath13 that it eventually returns is in the actual grid and has been drawn with a probability proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "we call this _ dynamic _ rejection sampling because the sampled distribution changes with the current node @xmath12 . considering @xmath12 as a relative center , the actual grid @xmath51 moves with @xmath12 and acts like an acceptance mask . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution over the virtual lattice @xmath52 remains constant .",
    "this enables to draw batches of relative shortcuts that can be used over multiple runs , exactly like for the torus approximation .",

    "in fact , axis nodes are covered redundantly .",
    "this gives @xmath66",
    "lastly , if one folds @xmath67 back into @xmath59 like the corners of a sheet of paper , we get a strict injection @xmath68 from @xmath67 to @xmath69 ( the diagonal nodes of @xmath59 are not covered ) . moreover , for all @xmath70 .",

    "as @xmath5 grows , the probability mass gets more and more concentrated around @xmath12 ( hence in @xmath51 ) , so we should expect better performance ( cf section [ sec : performance - analysis ] ) . *",
    "the dynamic rejection sampling approach can be used in other variants of kleinberg s model , like for other dimensions or when the number of shortcuts per node is a random variable ( like in @xcite ) .",

    "simulations were executed on a low end device ( a dell tablet with 4 gb ram and intel m-5y10 processor ) , which was largely sufficient for getting fast and accurate results on very large grids , thanks to the dynamic rejection sampling .",

    ". failed shortcuts become negligible ( rate greater than @xmath102 ) for @xmath103 .",

    "the reason is that @xmath104 is lower than @xmath105 , which overcompensates the success rate difference .",
    "given the tremendous amount of strong theoretical results on small - world routing , one can question the interest of proposing a simulator ( even a fast one ! ) .    in this section ,",
    "we prove the interest of numerical evaluation through three ( almost ) independent small studies .      in @xcite , kleinberg gives an estimation of @xmath106 using a torus approximation ( cf section [ sec : torus - approximation ] ) .",

    "we believe that these observations are very important as they show that routing in kleinberg s grid is more robust than predicted by theory : it is efficient as long as @xmath5 is _ close enough _ to 2 .    using our simulator",

    "the results are quite similar to the ones observed in @xcite .    table [ x = r , y = delivery ] ;    yet , there is a small but _ essential _ difference between the two experiments : kleinberg approximated his grid by a torus while we stay true to the original model .",
    "why do we use the word _ essential _ ? both shapes have the same asymptotic behavior ( proofs in @xcite are straightforward to adapt ) , so why should we care ?",
    "it seems to us that practical robustness is an essential feature if one wants to accept kleinberg s grid as a reasonable model for routing in social networks . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no theoretical work gives quantitative results on this robustness , so we need to rely on numerical evaluation .",
    "but when kleinberg uses a torus approximation , we can not rule out that the observed robustness is a by - side effect of the toroidal topology .",
    "the observation of a similar phenomenon on a flat grid discards this hypothesis .",
    "in fact , it suggests ( without proving ) that the robustness with respect to the exponent for grids of finite size may be a general phenomenon .",
    "we propose now to investigate this robustness in deeper details .",

    "[ [ remark-1 ] ] remark + + + + + +    for @xmath150 , we have observed that @xmath151 , which is the expected delivery path in absence of shortcuts : for these high values of @xmath5 , almost all shortcuts link to an immediate neighbor of the current node , which make them useless , and the rare exceptions are so short that they make no noticeable difference .",
    "what makes milgram s experiments @xcite so famous is the surprising observation that only a few hops are required to transmit messages in social networks , a phenomenon called _ six degrees of separation _ in popular culture .",
    "yet , the values of @xmath17 observed until now are quite far for the magic number six .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : n20000 ] , the lowest value is 140 .",
    "in addition to the asymptotic lack of robustness with respect to the exponent ( discussed in section [ sec : efficient - enough - exponents ] ) , this may partially motivate the amount of work accomplished to increase the realism of the model and the performance of the routing algorithm .    in our opinion , a good model should be as simple as possible while being able to accurately predict the phenomenon that needs to be explained .",
    "we propose here to answer a simple question : is the genuine model of greedy routing in @xmath3 a good model ?",
    "sure , it is quite simple . to discuss its accuracy ,",
    "we need to tune the four parameters @xmath152 and @xmath11 to fit the conditions of milgram s experiments as honestly as we can .",
    "size : :    the experiments of milgram were conducted in the united states , with a    population of about 200,000,000 at the late sixties . all inhabitants    were not susceptible to participate to the experiments : under - aged ,    undergraduate or disadvantaged people may be considered as _ de facto _    excluded from the experiments . taking that into consideration , the    correct @xmath25",
    "is probably somewhere in the range    @xmath153 $ ] .",
    "we propose to set    @xmath154 , which corresponds to about 72,000,000    potential subjects .",
    "exponent : :    in @xcite , kleinberg investigates how to relate the    @xmath155-harmonic distribution with real - life observations .",
    "he    surveys multiple social experiments and discusses the correspondence    with the exponent of his model , which gives estimates of    @xmath5 between 1.75 and 2.2 .",
    "neighborhood : :    the default value @xmath16 means that there are no    more than five `` acquaintances '' per node .",
    "this is quite small    compared to what is observed in real - life social networks . for    example",
    ", the famous dunbar s number , which estimates the number of    _ active _ relationships , is 150 @xcite .",
    "more recent studies seem to    indicate that the average number of acquaintances is larger , ranging    from 250 to 1500 ( see @xcite and references within ) .",
    "we    propose to set @xmath156 and @xmath11 so that the    neighborhood size @xmath157 is about 600 , the value    reported in @xcite .",
    "regarding the partition between local links    ( @xmath156 ) and shortcuts ( @xmath11 ) , we consider    three typical scenarios :    +    * @xmath158 , @xmath159 ( shortcut scenario :    the neighborhood is almost exclusively made of shortcuts , and local    links are only here to ensure the termination of greedy routing ) .",
    "* @xmath160 , @xmath161 ( balanced scenario ) .",
    "* @xmath162 , @xmath163 ( local scenario ,    with a value of @xmath11 not too far from dunbar s number ) .",
    "having set all parameters , we can evaluate the performance of greedy routing .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ fig : six ] .",

    "@xmath165 $ ] for the balanced scenario . *",
    "@xmath166 $ ] for the local scenario .",
    "except for the local scenario , which leads to slightly higher routing times for @xmath167 , the six degrees of separation are achieved for all values of @xmath5 that are consistent with the observations surveyed in @xcite .",
    "this allows to answer our question : the augmented grid proposed by kleinberg is indeed a good model to explain the _ six degrees of separation _ phenomenon .",

    "we proposed an algorithm to evaluate the performance of greedy routing in kleinberg s grid .",
    "fueled by a dynamic rejection sampling approach , the simulator based on our solution performs several orders of magnitude faster than previous attempts .",
    "it allowed us to investigate greedy routing under multiple perspective .",
    "* we noted that the performance of greedy routing is less sensitive to the choice of the exponent @xmath5 than predicted by the asymptotic behavior , even for very large grids . *",
    "we observed that the bounds proposed in @xcite are not tight except for @xmath168 and @xmath24 .",
    "we conjectured that the tight bounds are the 2-dimensional equivalent of bounds proposed in @xcite for the 1-dimensional ring .",
    "* we claimed that the model proposed by kleinberg in @xcite is a good model for the _ six degrees of separation _ , in the sense that it is very simple _ and _ accurate .",
    "our simulator is intended as a tool to suggest and evaluate theoretical results , and possibly to build another bridge between theoretical and empirical study of social systems .",
    "we hope that it will be useful for researchers from both communities . in a future work ,",
