    "fullerenes and fullerene related structures have gained a lot of interest in the past 20 years .",
    "fullerenes were discovered for the first time in 1985 @xcite and are carbon - cage molecules with a large number @xmath0 of carbon ( c ) atoms bonded in a nearly spherically symmetric configuration .",
    "the configuration is such that three of the valence electrons of the carbon atom form the bounds with the neighbouring carbon atoms .",
    "this means , that one `` free '' valence electron can `` hop '' along the the @xmath0 positions in the fullerene .",
    "the @xmath1 fullerene , the so - called `` buckminster '' fullerene , has 60 carbon atoms arranged on a lattice with 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons .",
    "it has a diameter of @xmath2  . in general , fullerenes with @xmath0 carbon atoms consists of lattices with 12 pentagons and @xmath3 hexagons , where @xmath4 has to be even .",
    "fullerides are alkali - doped fullerenes , i.e. fullerenes on which alkali metal atoms such as rubidium ( rb ) , potassium ( k ) , caesium ( cs ) or sodium ( na ) are put .",
    "these alkali metals donate one electron each .",
    "it was observed that such `` doping '' leads to a metallic or even superconducting behaviour @xcite .",
    "the interesting thing about this is that the transition temperature @xmath5 of the fullerides is quite high for superconductors , e.g. @xmath6 k for a rbcs@xmath7c@xmath8 @xcite . in an attempt to explain this high transition temperature",
    ", it was found that phonon - electron interactions in the fullerides can explain this phenomenon quite well @xcite .",
    "nanotubes are fullerene related structures , which were discovered for the first time in 1991 @xcite .",
    "these molecules have cylindrical shape and the carbon atoms are arranged on a hexagonal grid .",
    "the ends of the nanotubes are typically closed by caps of pentagonal rings .",
    "while the tubes discovered in 1991 were multi - layered , single - walled tubes were synthesised in 1993 @xcite .",
    "the tubes are distinguished by their chirality , diameter and lengths .",
    "they have average diameters of 1.2 to 1.4 nm and can be up to 2 mm long . concerning their chirality ,",
    "the tubes are typically put into three different classes : armchair , zigzag or chiral tubes @xcite .",
    "depending on their structure , the tubes have different mechanical , thermal , optical and electrical properties .",
    "the chirality determines e.g. whether the tubes behave metallic or semiconducting .",
    "these facts also lead to the conclusion that a distortion of the hexagonal lattice would influence the energy - band gap .",
    "a distortion can be achieved in two ways : either by external , mechanical forces such as bending , stretching or twisting or by an interaction of the lattice with an internal excitation . trying to explain the dispersion - free energy transport in biopolymers , davydov realised @xcite that the interaction of an internal excitation with the distorted lattice ( whose distortion was initially caused by the internal excitation ) leads to a localised state , a soliton @xcite . for the case of biopolymers ,",
    "the internal excitation is an amide i vibration .    motivated by the research on fullerene related structures , the interaction of a 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice with an excitation caused by an `` excess electron '' was studied recently @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is of frhlich - type and describes `` electron - phonon '' interactions .",
    "it was found that the existence of soliton - like structures depends crucially on the value of the `` electron - phonon '' coupling .",
    "interestingly , in the continuum limit , this latter system of equations reduces to a modified non - linear schrdinger equation , where the extra term appearing due to the discreteness of the lattice and the `` electron - phonon '' interaction , leads to the stabilisation of the soliton .",
    "the appearance of this type of equation has been observed also for a similar system on a quadratic lattice @xcite .",
    "consequently , the modified non - linear schrdinger equation was studied on a 2-dimensional plane in @xcite and on a sphere in @xcite using an ansatz previously introduced in the study of boson stars @xcite and q - balls @xcite .",
    "non - spinning as well as spinning solutions with and without nodes were constructed .    in this paper , we study the modified non - linear schrdinger equation arising as continuum limit of the equations describing the interaction of an electron - like excitation with a hexagonal lattice . in section",
    "ii , we review some generalities . using the ansatz introduced in @xcite , we construct solutions for three different cases , which we describe in sections iii - v . in section iii , we discuss the results for the solutions on the sphere obtained in @xcite from another point of view , namely we give the spectrum of the equation . in section iv , we discuss the solutions on a 2-dimensional disc with fixed radius and demonstrate how the solutions obtained on the plane @xcite can be understood in this context . in section",
    "v , we discuss the equation on a cylinder with fixed radius and fixed length .",
    "we give our conclusions in section vi .",
    "the starting point is a coupled systems of discrete equations describing the interaction of an excitation ( e.g. an `` excess electron '' ) with a regular lattice in two dimensions .",
    "the excitation is given in terms of a complex valued scalar field @xmath9 , while the lattice displacements are described by two fields , one standing for the displacement in @xmath10 , the other for that in @xmath11 direction .",
    "these discrete equations were studied for the quadratic lattice in @xcite and for the hexagonal lattice in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it was found for the hexagonal lattice that in the stationary limit it is possible to replace the full system of equation , in which the excitation field @xmath9 and the displacement fields are coupled , by a modified discrete non - linear schrdinger equation .",
    "this is not possible for the quadratic lattice .    in the continuum limit",
    ", both systems of equations reduce to a modified non - linear schrdinger equation .",
    "the new term appearing in this equation , which results from both the discreteness of the lattice as well as from the interaction between the lattice and the complex valued scalar field @xmath9 ( `` lattice - excitation interaction '' ) , leads to the stabilisation of the solution .",
    "the difference between the quadratic and the hexagonal case is just the coefficient in front of the non - linear term in the equation , which , however is of the same order of magnitude for the two cases .    since we are dealing with fullerene related structures here , we consider the modified non - linear schrdinger equation , which arises as continuum limit in the hexagonal case @xcite . in dimensionless variables",
    "it reads : @xmath12 @xmath13 is the coupling constant of the system and determines the `` strength '' of the non - linear character of the equation .",
    "especially , as can be seen from the derivation of the modified non - linear schrdinger equation from the discrete equations @xcite , the mass of the carbon atom is encoded into @xmath13 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the equation ( [ cnls ] ) above on a 2-dimensional sphere of radius @xmath14 aiming to describe `` electronic '' excitations on fullerenes and fullerides .",
    "the laplacian operator in this case reads : @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 @xmath17 @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath21 is a complex valued scalar field .",
    "solutions of ( [ cnls ] ) considered on the sphere with radius @xmath14 can be characterised by their norm : @xmath22 as well as by their energy : @xmath23 we will construct normalised solutions , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "note that in @xcite a different strategy was employed . by rescaling the wave - function @xmath25 ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath13 can be eliminated from the equation .",
    "( of course , the normalisation of the wave - function is lost in this approach , but since @xmath26 was plotted , the corresponding value of @xmath13 could be easily determined . ) in this paper , we put the emphasis on the evolution of the spectrum ( corresponding to normalised eigenfunctions ) as a function of the coupling constant @xmath13 .",
    "note that @xmath13 determines the `` strength '' of the non - linear part of the equation and that for @xmath27 , the equation becomes the ordinary schrdinger equation on the sphere , which , of course , is linear .      to construct explicit solutions ,",
    "we employ the following axially symmetric ansatz @xcite : @xmath28 the solutions with @xmath29 are non - spinning solutions , while the spinning solutions will have @xmath30 .    inserting this ansatz into ( [ cnls ] )",
    ", we find the following equation @xcite : @xmath31 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "this is a priori a non - linear equation with external parameters @xmath13 and @xmath32 . here",
    ", we will consider it from a slightly different point of view .",
    "let us rewrite ( [ phi ] ) as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the effective spectral parameter .",
    "the equation then appears as an eigenvalue schdinger equation supplemented by a non - linear term coupled with the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the solutions in the linear case , i.e. for @xmath27 are well - known and it is very likely that - by continuity- their deformation due to the non - linear term can be constructed at least for small values of @xmath13 .",
    "however , this does not exclude the occurence of supplementary branches of solutions , which may appear typically due to the non - linear structure of the equation .    in order to construct regular solutions , ( [ nlsemod ] )",
    "has to be solved subject to the following boundary conditions : @xmath35 and @xmath36    to solve the equation ( [ nlsemod ] ) numerically subject to the boundary conditions ( [ bc1 ] ) , respectively ( [ bc2 ] ) for generic values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we use a numerical routine based on the newton - raphson method @xcite .",
    "our strategy is to use @xmath37 , respectively @xmath38 as a `` shooting '' parameter for the case @xmath29 and @xmath30 .      in the case",
    "@xmath27 , ( [ nlsemod ] ) reduces to the well - known legendre equation @xmath39 the solutions of this equation are the associated legendre functions : @xmath40 where @xmath41 the spatial part of ( [ ansatz ] ) are then the spherical harmonics @xmath42 .",
    "notice , however , that in the equation studied here there is no distinction between @xmath43 and @xmath44 . from now on",
    ", we will assume @xmath43 to be positive , but it is understood that the solution with corresponding @xmath44 can be trivially obtained .",
    "the spherical harmonics have a well - defined parity , i.e. they are either symmetric or anti - symmetric under the reflection @xmath45 . in addition , the number of zeros in the interval @xmath460:\\pi[$ ] is equal to @xmath47 .",
    "these results are , of course , very well- known , but we mention them for completeness and because the spectrum of the full equation will approach the spectrum of the legendre equation in the @xmath48 limit .",
    "all the solutions discussed in the previous section are continuously deformed when the parameter @xmath13 is chosen to be larger than zero .",
    "for every available spherical harmonic , we observe that a branch of solutions in @xmath13 exists , on which the solutions have the same symmetry than in the @xmath27 limit .",
    "our numerical results further indicate that the number of zeros @xmath49 of the solution is preserved all along the branch and is equal to @xmath50 .",
    "now , we will discuss in detail the numerical solutions corresponding to the deformations of the spherical harmonics @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    *",
    "the non - spinning ( @xmath29 ) and nodeless ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) solution corresponding to the case @xmath51 is in fact the constant solution of the equation , namely @xmath56 the eigenvalue @xmath57 of the corresponding normalised solution has a linear dependence of the parameter @xmath13 : @xmath58 this dependence is shown in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath59 . *",
    "the non - spinning ( @xmath29 ) , one - node ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) solution is anti - symmetric under the reflection @xmath62 . the function @xmath63 is progressively deformed by the non - linear term for @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 the profile of the function @xmath66 possesses a plateau @xmath67 surrounding the region of @xmath68 .",
    "away from this plateau , the solutions resemble two disconnected solitons located at the two poles of the sphere , i.e. the maxima of @xmath69 are situated around @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "stated in other words , the probability density vanishes in a region surrounding the equator , while it has local maxima at the two poles . let us stress , that the physical parameters remain monotonic functions of the `` shooting '' parameter @xmath37 .",
    "+ the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath13 is shown in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath59 . for @xmath27 , we have @xmath72 , as expected .",
    "it is worth noticing that the two eigenvalues corresponding to the quantum numbers @xmath73 and @xmath29 , @xmath60 cross at @xmath74 .",
    "this would a priori mean , that the `` excited '' solution becomes the `` ground state '' of the equation .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , the appearance of new asymmetric solutions will turn out to have even lower values of @xmath57 . * the spinning ( @xmath75 ) , no - node ( @xmath60 , @xmath55 ) solutions arrive as deformations of the spherical harmonic @xmath76 .",
    "this solution is thus symmetric under the reflection @xmath62 .",
    "in contrast to the non - spinning solutions , we notice here that when the coupling constant @xmath13 is of order @xmath77 , the structure of the solutions becomes very sensitive to the value of the `` shooting '' parameter @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , there exists a critical value of @xmath78 ( depending on @xmath14 ) such that no solutions exist for @xmath79 .",
    "our numerical results , however , suggest that solutions of arbitrary large values of @xmath13 can be constructed when considering the limit @xmath80 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue of @xmath57 decreases monotonically with @xmath13 from @xmath72 ( for the case @xmath27 ) as can be seen in fig.[fig1 ] for the case @xmath59 .",
    "of course , this curve also represents the solution with @xmath81 , so that the eigenvalue @xmath57 is three - fold degenerated in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "+ finally , let us state that for these solutions , the function @xmath82 has a maximum at the equator and vanishes at the poles .",
    "this is an interesting result with view to @xcite . in this latter paper",
    "it was found that if a c@xmath8 or a c@xmath83 molecule is doped with one or two excess electrons , the additional charges accumulate nearly along an equatorial line of the molecule .    of course",
    ", deformations of the legendre functions for higher @xmath43 and @xmath84 can be constructed in a systematic way .",
    "all solutions of the non - linear equation ( [ nlsemod ] ) discussed previously appear as continuous deformations of the solutions available in the linear limit @xmath27 .",
    "however , in this section , we will exhibit new branches of solutions , which are fundamentally non - linear phenomena and as these have no linear counterparts .",
    "numerically , we find that these new branches of solutions exist for sufficiently high values of the coupling constant @xmath13 parametrising the non - linear effect and that some of these branches bifurcate into the branches of the deformed legendre functions at critical values of @xmath85 , which depend on @xmath84 , @xmath43 ( and thus on the number of nodes @xmath86 ) as well as on the radius @xmath14 .",
    "these solutions are charaterised by the fact that they are asymmetric with respect to the reflection @xmath62 .",
    "* asymmetric , non - spinning ( @xmath29 ) and nodeless ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) solutions exist for @xmath87 .",
    "when the parameter @xmath13 is chosen larger than this critical value , our numerical results indicate that this solution has a maximum at @xmath71 and a minimum at @xmath70 and decreases monotonically between these two extrema , which are strictly positive .",
    "thus , the solution is neither symmetric nor anti - symmetric under the reflection @xmath62 .",
    "instead , this reflection applied to the solution leads to an equivalent solution with a maximum ( respectively minimum ) at @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the solutions thus represent a physical state with probability density concentrated in one of the hemispheres .",
    "this is a new feature that can not arise in the deformation of the legendre functions .",
    "+ in the limit @xmath88 the values of the maximum and the minimum approach each other and the solution becomes constant .",
    "the branch of these asymmetric solutions bifurcates into the branch of constant solutions ( deformed @xmath89 ) described in the previous section .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath32 of these asymmetric solutions is lower than the one of the symmetric branch .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig1 ] ( dotted line ) for @xmath59 .",
    "+ for generic values of @xmath14 , the bifurcation of the asymmetric branch occurs at @xmath90 with @xmath91 * asymmetric , non - spinning ( @xmath29 ) and one - node ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) solutions exist for @xmath92 . in this region of parameter values",
    ", we find that in fact two branches of solutions exist ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath13 , the solution with the lower value of @xmath57 has a bigger value of @xmath93 and its minimum lies at smaller values of @xmath16 .",
    "this is demonstrated for @xmath94 , @xmath59 in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath32 corresponding to these asymmetric solutions are higher than the values of the corresponding ( i.e. with for the same values of @xmath13 ) antisymmetric solution on the branch of deformed legendre functions @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast to the other described cases , we have not succeeded to construct another ( a third ) branch which would eventually bifurcate from the branch of deformed legendre functions .",
    "* asymmetric , spinning ( @xmath75 ) and nodeless ( @xmath60 , @xmath55 ) solutions exist for @xmath95 . solving the equations for values of @xmath13 larger than this critical value",
    ", we were able to construct a branch of asymmetric solutions ( and the corresponding mirror symmetric one ) .",
    "the maximum of these solutions is located between @xmath71 and @xmath68 such that the probability density is located in one of the hemispheres .",
    "as before , the frequency of the asymmetric solution is lower than the frequency of the corresponding ( i.e. same @xmath13 ) solution on the deformed @xmath53 branch .",
    "the construction of asymmetric branches with higher values of the spin @xmath43 and/or higher node numbers @xmath49 becomes very tricky .",
    "this is mainly due to the occurence of many solutions existing for the same values of the parameters and also due to the fact that the profiles of the symmetric and asymmetric ( or anti - symmetric and asymmetric ) solutions can be very close to each other on a large part of the @xmath96 $ ] interval .",
    "the construction of asymmetric branches can thus not be achieved systematically .",
    "in @xcite the equation ( [ cnls ] ) was discussed on a two - dimensional plane and non - spinning as well as spinning solutions with nodes were constructed . here",
    ", we will treat this problem differently . with view to the discussion of the equation on a sphere",
    ", we will discuss here the equation on a two - dimensional disc with radius @xmath97 parametrized by the coordinates @xmath98 and @xmath19 .",
    "the case studied in @xcite then arises as limit @xmath99 .",
    "the laplacian is given by : @xmath100 with @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "the norm reads : @xmath102 and the energy is given by : @xmath103      as for the case on the sphere , we adopt the following ansatz for the complex valued function @xmath104 : @xmath105 inserting this ansatz gives the following equation : @xmath106 where the prime now denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath98 .",
    "we can rewrite , analogue to before , the equation in the following way : @xmath107 this equation looks like the one studied in @xcite , however , we impose different boundary conditions here : @xmath108 and @xmath109 again , we used the numerical routine described in @xcite to solve the equation ( [ eqdisc ] ) subject to the boundary conditions ( [ bc3 ] ) , respectively ( [ bc4 ] )",
    ".      in the limit @xmath27 ( [ eqdisc ] ) reduces to the linear schrdinger equation in polar coordinates @xmath110 note that for static solutions , i.e. @xmath111 , the equation reduces to the euler equation with solutions of the form @xmath112 . for @xmath113 ,",
    "the equation becomes the bessel equation if we define @xmath114 and @xmath115 : @xmath116 the solutions of this equation , which are regular at the origin are of course the well - known bessel functions @xmath117 for @xmath118 and the modified bessel functions @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "remembering that the bessel functions @xmath117 are oscillating and admit an infinite number of nodes on the positive real axis , it is easy to construct solutions of ( [ eqdiscnew ] ) with @xmath49 nodes .",
    "this is possible assuming that @xmath121 and choosing the value of @xmath32 in such the way that the value @xmath122 coincides with the @xmath49-th zero ( we call it @xmath123 ) of the bessel function @xmath124 , i.e. @xmath125 .",
    "this indicates that in the limit @xmath27 solutions with angular momentum @xmath43 and with @xmath49 nodes exist and the spectrum of the equation is positive .",
    "the corresponding functions are convex .      if the coupling constant @xmath13 is positive but small , we expect that the pattern of solutions will be similar to the one available in the limit @xmath27 discussed above .",
    "our numerical results indeed confirm this expectation . for small values of @xmath13 ,",
    "the solutions are still represented by convex functions and the values of @xmath32 are positive and decrease slowly with @xmath13 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for the case @xmath29 , @xmath55 .",
    "let is call this range of @xmath13-values the `` weak coupling - regime '' .",
    "when @xmath13 is large enough , the value of @xmath32 becomes negative ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) and the solutions have an inflexion point at some intermediate value of @xmath98 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) . as a consequence",
    "they become much more localized in the region around the origin . in this `` strong coupling - regime ''",
    "the solutions can thus be described as being soliton - like .",
    "we also note that the value of @xmath32 decreases very strongly with @xmath13 .",
    "the difference between the strong and weak coupling is shown in fig.[fig4 ] for @xmath127 , respectively @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the value @xmath32 is shown in dependence on @xmath13 for the non - spinning ( @xmath29 ) and nodeless ( @xmath55 ) solution for different values of the disc - radius @xmath97 in fig.[fig3 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we also superposed the values of @xmath32 corresponding to the case of the full plane ( i.e. @xmath130 ) .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , in this case , solutions exists only for large enough values of @xmath13 : @xmath131 .",
    "it is therefore natural to try to understand the pattern available on the plane as the @xmath132 limit of the pattern of solutions for the disc . in this respect",
    ", it is interesting to notice that in the `` strong coupling - regime '' the values of @xmath32 corresponding to a finite disc get very close ( especially for the case corresponding to @xmath133 ) to the values of @xmath32 associated with the case of the infinite disc .",
    "this is related to the fact that with increasing @xmath13 , the `` soliton '' becomes more and more peaked around the origin and does nt `` notice '' whether the disc is finite or infinite .",
    "this observation gives a natural explanation for the fact that solutions exist only for @xmath134 in the case of the plane .",
    "indeed in the case of the plane , it was noticed @xcite that the linearized equation ( valid asymptotically ) also is of bessel type .",
    "however , the nodeless , localized solutions are exponentially decreasing and can only be associated with the modified bessel function , which correspond to negative values of @xmath32 .",
    "that s why , on the plane , nodeless soliton - like solutions exist only for @xmath135 and have no `` weak coupling''-counterparts . for large values of @xmath13",

    "we also studied the solutions with @xmath137 nodes and @xmath138 and found that the pattern is similar to the case @xmath55 and @xmath29 discussed above in detail .",
    "we do not find it useful to discuss them here , but we believe that our results provide a robust evidence that regular solutions of ( [ eqdisc ] ) with an arbitrary number of nodes and arbitrary ( integer ) angular momentum exist on the disc / plane .",
    "we also considered the equation on a cylinder of radius @xmath139 and length @xmath140 .",

    "the only noticable difference resides in the fact that , in the limit @xmath163 , a normalizable solution can be constructed for all values of the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "this case is , of course , interesting with iew to nanotubes since the lengths @xmath140 of a tube is much larger than its diameter @xmath164 . in the case of the `` ground state '' solution , which is non - spinning ( @xmath29 ) and nodeless ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the following relations hold : @xmath165 unlike in the case of the sphere , we did not succeed in constructing asymmetric solutions in the case of the cylinder ( i.e. solutions , which are neither even nor odd under the reflexion @xmath159 ) and we believe that there are no such solutions .",
    "in this paper we have presented an extended analysis of a modified non - linear schrdinger equation in 1 + 2 dimensions .",

    "these are , namely , a cylinder to mimick excitations on a carbon nanotube and a sphere , respectively , in order to describe excitations ( e.g. extra electrons ) on a fullerene nanomolecule , which is particularly interesting with view to the possibility of describing the high transition temperature of superconducting fullerides .    completed with the different types of boundary conditions related to the geometry and using an ansatz previously introduced in the study of boson stars @xcite and spinnning q - balls @xcite , the equation ( [ cnls ] ) possesses a lot symmetries , some are continuous ( like rotations ) , some are discrete ( like reflexions ) .    in all cases considered the spectrum of solutions is rich , many `` normal - mode''-types of solutions exist , mainly characterized by two integers : the internal angular momentum ( or spin ) and the number of nodes of the wave function .",
    "this is very reminiscent to the principal quantum numbers of more familiar quantum mechanical systems .",
    "it might turn out to be difficult to classify the solutions of a non - linear , partial differential equations .",
    "the various types of solutions , however , can be traced back from the corresponding solutions available in the weak coupling limit , in which the equation becomes linear and its spectrum is known analytically . in the case of the sphere , disc and cylinder , respectively , we found deformed legendre functions , deformed bessel functions and deformed harmonic functions .",
    "however , in the case of the sphere , we demonstrated the existence of additional solutions , which are specifically related to the non - linear character of the equation .",
    "the main feature distinguishing these supplementary solutions is their asymmetry with respect to the reflexion at the equator of the sphere . in other words",
    ", we exhibited the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of one of the natural symmetries of the initial problem .",
    "this ssb occurs when the non - linear coupling becomes strong enough .",
    "similarly it can occur for very different types of non - linear equations . as an example",
    ", we point out the bifurcation of bisphaleron solutions from the sphaleron solutions available in the case of the classical equations of the electroweak field theory @xcite . in this case",
    ", the parity operator is spontaneously broken by the so called bisphaleron solutions .",
