    "in the previous paper ( @xcite , hereafter ye ) , we determined neutral stability points of the _ chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz _ ( cfs ) instability of general relativistic rotating polytropes , by which non - axisymmetric oscillations of rotating stars are excited through the coupling with gravitational radiation ( see @xcite ) . in the absence of viscosity",
    "this instability sets in at the points where eigenfrequencies of the modes vanish as seen from the inertial observer at spatial infinity .",
    "thus to determine the points on equilibrium sequences of rotating stars where the model begins to become unstable , zero frequency modes in the asymptotically inertial frame must be found .    in ye",
    "the equations of state ( eos ) of stellar matter were restricted to the simple relation of polytropes and neutral points of the counter - rotating f - modes were obtained . here",
    "the counter - rotating modes denote the oscillations whose phase propagation is retrograde with respect to the stellar rotation as seen from the observer rotating with the star .",
    "in this paper we investigate oscillation modes and their neutral points of stability for more realistic eos proposed for the neutron star matter .",
    "the investigated modes are the same ones as in ye which may be the most susceptible _ spheroidal _ modes to the cfs instability .",
    "it has been discussed that modes with the azimuthal quantum number @xmath0 to @xmath1 , by which the eigenfunction of the modes are decomposed to harmonics having angular @xmath2coordinate dependence @xmath3 , are the most interesting for this instability ( @xcite ) .",
    "also interesting is the recently discovered bar mode neutral points for rather soft eos , which never appear in the newtonian framework ( for fully general relativistic treatments , see @xcite ; also see ye ) .",
    "thus we will investigate these lower order modes in this paper .    concerning the neutral points to the cfs instability , morsink et al .",
    "( 1998 , hereafter msb ) investigated realistic neutron star models by applying the numerical method to find the exact neutral modes of general relativistic rotating stars developed by stergioulas and friedman ( 1997 ) .",
    "they obtained f - mode neutral points for models with various masses for several representative eos .",
    "therefore we will compare our results with theirs .",
    "the counter - rotating f - modes are not only interesting in the context of the cfs instability of a single neutron star , but also may play an important role in compact binary systems because they may couple strongly with the tidal potential of the companion .",
    "the most significant effect will be the resonant excitation of the modes by the tidal force and its back reaction to the orbital motion of the binary system .",
    "we will study this subject in the last section of this paper .",
    "we assume that axisymmetric equilibrium stars are rotating uniformly and that the stellar matter is described by zero temperature eos . under these assumptions ,",
    "equilibrium states of relativistic rotating stars are obtained numerically by the keh scheme ( @xcite ) .",
    "linear adiabatic perturbations may be a good approximation in the present situation , and it is also assumed that the adiabatic index @xmath4 of the perturbation coincides with the local adiabatic index of the equilibrium star as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 means the lagrangian perturbation of the corresponding variable .",
    "eulerian perturbations of the metric components are totally omitted as in the previous study ( ye ) , i.e. , the cowling approximation is adopted .",
    "there exist many candidates for eos of real neutron stars with zero temperature .",
    "we here examine some of the representative eos to cover the wide range of stiffness .",
    "our choices are those of 1 ) pandharipande with hyperon ( denoted by eos b in @xcite ) , 2 ) bethe - johnson without hyperon ( @xcite ) , 3 ) bethe - johnson ( eos c in arnett & bowers ) and 4 ) more recent wff3 ( @xcite ) joined to nv ( @xcite ) in the low density region . in order to compare our result with those of msb ,",
    "the eos of pandharipande without hyperon ( eos a in arnett & bowers ) is also employed .",
    "extremely stiff eos l in arnett & bowers is used only in figure 8 for the comparison of the eoss with a wide range of stiffness .",
    "our numerical scheme is basically the same as that in ye .",
    "perturbed quantities are assumed to behave as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the killing time coordinate .",
    "a minor change that has been made is the introduction of a function @xmath9 , instead of the eulerian perturbation of the emden function for polytropic stars .",
    "coefficients of the perturbed equations contain the background metric and its connection coefficients as well as the pressure gradient and a function of adiabatic index like @xmath10 .",
    "we have used @xmath11 grid points for equilibrium models where @xmath12 are the spherical polar coordinates . since less number of grid point",
    "is used for the perturbational calculation due to the restrictions of the power of the computer , values for equilibrium states are interpolated to give values at the coarse grid points of our surface - fitted coordinate ( see ye ) . the interpolation is done by employing the cubic spline scheme in two dimensions .",
    "the results in this paper are obtained by using @xmath13 grid points in the surface - fitted coordinate .",
    "rotational sequences of equilibrium stars can be obtained by fixing the central energy density @xmath14 and changing the rotational parameter such as the ratio of the polar radius to the equatorial radius in the meridional cross section of the star .",
    "physical quantities such as the gravitational mass , the @xmath15 value and the angular momentum , etc . are calculated after equilibrium configurations are computed . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the rotational energy and the gravitational energy , respectively , whose definitions can be found in komatsu et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and its ratio can be considered to be a standard indicator of the stellar rotation . by changing the central density many sequences of equilibrium stars",
    "are obtained and a series of models with the same gravitational mass and a different rotational frequency can be chosen . for these equilibrium models",
    "the eigenproblem is solved numerically .    in this paper",
    "we will concentrate only on the counter - rotating f - modes .",
    "they are the generalization of the kelvin modes of newtonian maclaurin spheroids with the counter - rotating phase velocity as seen from the co - rotating observer with the star and have indices @xmath18 of the spheroidal harmonics .",
    "these particular modes may be the most susceptible to the cfs instability ( see @xcite ) and have been mainly investigated as to this instability .",
    "figures 1  7 show the dependency of eigenfrequency @xmath19 on the rotational frequency @xmath20 for the specified eos and for the fixed gravitational mass . for slowly rotating models , the frequency becomes higher as @xmath21 increases .",
    "note that , since we are considering the behavior of the perturbed quantities expressed as @xmath22 , the phase velocity @xmath23 is negative in this case .",
    "as the rotational frequency is increased , the rotational dragging effect on the mode ( _ not _ the inertial - frame - dragging effect in general relativity ) works more strongly for the larger @xmath21 modes and the order of the mode frequencies are reversed . as a result ,",
    "modes with larger @xmath21 pass the neutral points earlier on the sequences .",
    "near the mass - shedding limit , eigenvalues rise sharply with the increase of the rotational parameter . by using more detailed data set from which",
    "these graphs are produced , we can have much smoother eigenfrequency curves with the fixed central energy density and show that this behavior is also seen there .",
    "however , the eigenfunctions of these models show sharp rises of the amplitudes near the surface region on the equatorial plane .",
    "therefore , the rather coarse angular resolution may prevent us from solving the numerical eigenvalue problem accurately near the mass - shedding limit .",
    "next we show the typical behaviors of the eigenfrequencies of the mode of our interest . in figure",
    "8 dimensionless eigenfrequency of the @xmath0 mode is plotted against dimensionless rotational frequency for three of the eoss with various stiffness , with the gravitational mass of the model being fixed ( as @xmath24 ) .",
    "the eos b is the softest among the three , and the eos wff3-nv , eos l become stiffer in this order .",
    "normalization factor of them is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the averaged density with @xmath27 and @xmath28 being the gravitational mass and the proper volume of the equilibrium star .",
    "we can see that with this normalization the eigenfrequency is rather insensitive to the stiffness of the eos from cases with no rotation to those nearly at the mass - shedding limits .",
    "figure 9 displays the variation of the normalized eigenfrequency due to the gravitational mass difference , with the eos being fixed ( as wff3-nv ) .",
    "it is seen that increase in gravitational mass makes the mode frequency larger , which corresponds to the effect of the softening of the eos in figure 8 .",
    "this is reasonable since the strong self - gravity of the star tends to induce its density profile to be concentrated to the central region of it , which effectively realizes the configuration with the softer eos . in figures 10 and 11 ,",
    "we show the typical behavior of the eigenfunction @xmath29 .",
    "the equilibrium models compared in these two figures have the same central density but the rotational frequencies are different . in both models ,",
    "the function @xmath29 increases monotonically from the center to the surface of the star along the radial spokes in the surface - fitted coordinate . for the slowly rotating model ( fig.10 ) ,",
    "the angular dependence of the @xmath29 is nearly that of the associated legendre function , @xmath30 ( in this case @xmath31 ) , whereas rapid rotation tends to shift the distribution of the function @xmath29 to the equatorial plane ( fig.11 ) .    to see the radial dependence of the eigenfunction",
    ", we show the function @xmath29 on the equatorial plane ( fig.12 ) . here",
    "the same models are used as those in figures 10 and 11 . as a radial coordinate here",
    "we take the value @xmath32 , which roughly represents the matter - energy distribution of the equilibrium stars .",
    "as seen in this figure , the distribution of the function @xmath29 is concentrated to the surface region as the star rotates more rapidly . in the newtonian theory , the same situation seems to improve the cowling approximation for rapidly rotating stars ( @xcite ) because the role of perturbed gravitational potential becomes less important .",
    "roughly speaking , less part of the stellar mass participates in the oscillation as the star rotates more rapidly .",
    "this is also likely to be the case in general relativistic stars , though we have no exact quasi - normal modes to compare with .    in figure 13",
    "the differences of radial behavior in the equatorial plane between modes with different @xmath21 are shown . here",
    "the radial coordinate is that of the surface - fitted coordinates . it can be seen that as @xmath21 increases , the main part of oscillation of the star shifts outward where the amount of the mass fraction decreases",
    "this can make the cowling approximation more accurate for higher order modes ( see table 1 ) .",
    "as is already remarked , we can estimate the neutral points of the cfs instability by finding zeroes of the eigenfrequencies . in table 1",
    "we compare the values of @xmath15 at the neutral points of the instability with those obtained by msb .",
    "here we summarize the tendency of the cowling approximation in general relativity as follows : ( 1 ) for the same eos and for the same mode number , the cowling approximation gives better results as the central energy density of the model increases ; ( 2 ) for the same equilibrium model , it results in more accurate values for larger mode numbers ; and ( 3 ) the cowling approximation has a tendency to overestimate the stability in the case of relatively weak gravity ( cf . the newtonian case in @xcite ) .",
    "these are qualitatively consistent with the previous results in ye .",
    "in contrast to the property ( 3 ) , for larger central density ( strong gravity ) models , higher order modes seem to be underestimated in its stability by the cowling approximation . as for the bar mode",
    "there seems no improvement with increase of the central density .",

    "then we have a neutral stability curve of the cfs instability for the mode in the @xmath40 plane as a set of zeroes of the eigenfrequencies .",
    "four neutral stability curves corresponding to four different modes with different eos are shown in figures 14  17 .",
    "figure 14 displays those for the eos of bethe - johnson without hyperon .",
    "the region of the left hand side of each curve is the stable region against the cfs mechanism for the corresponding mode .",
    "the solid line is the mass - shedding limit curve on which the gas on the surface in the equatorial plane rotates with the local keplerian velocity .",
    "the dashed line in the upper region is the approximate maximum mass line for a given rotational frequency .",
    "the reason why we use the word approximate is that to obtain it we do not constrain the rotational frequency to be constant but the axis ratio of the configuration to be constant ( @xcite ) .    at first sight",
    ", it seems strange that for sufficiently rapidly rotating cases we have a model in the right hand side region of the mass - shedding curve .",
    "it seems to imply that for a given mass we have equilibrium models that have larger rotational frequencies than the mass - shedding case .",
    "this comes from the fact that the rotational frequency @xmath20 is _ not _ a proper measure of the rotation for extremely rapidly rotating stars ( see appendix for its explanation ) .",
    "we here apply our results to two issues of interest in neutron star physics .",
    "one is the estimation of the time scale of the cfs instability . the other",
    "is related to the resonant excitation of f - modes in inspiraling compact binary systems which are possible targets of the gravitational wave detectors under construction .      in the previous section",
    "neutral points of the cfs instability are determined .",
    "then what we want to know next is _ how fast these unstable perturbations grow beyond these points_. unfortunately our approximation does not provide us the answer directly .",
    "what is expected to happen in the real process is that the stellar free oscillations with non - zero frequencies couple to gravitational wave radiation which carries its energy to infinity , and the frequencies inevitably have imaginary parts .",
    "this is the problem of the so - called _ quasi - normal mode _ which is well - known in black hole physics . to obtain complex eigenfrequencies",
    ", we must take the metric perturbations into account and the _ out - going wave _",
    "conditions must be specified to them .",
    "this task is extraordinarily difficult for rapidly rotating stars and no investigation has been accomplished for it yet .    as its alternative",
    ", there have been several works which estimates the growth time of the instability by applying the gravitational radiation reaction potential of the post - newtonian expansion ( @xcite ) to newtonian stellar oscillations . in this approximation , we only need to know the time dependency of the mass multipole of the oscillating star .    here",
    "we roughly estimate the growth rates of the instability by following comins ( 1979 ) , who investigated the secular effects of the gravitational radiation reaction and viscosity on the oscillating maclaurin spheroids .",
    "according to the analysis of comins , the effect of gravitational radiation adds a small imaginary part to the oscillation frequency viewed from the co - rotating frame with the star @xmath41 as follows : @xmath42              ( m+1)(m+2)r_1^{2m+1 } ( 2\\pi)^{2 m }              \\nu^{2m+1 } }              { ( m-1)\\left[(2m+1)!!\\right]^2              \\left[(m-1)f - \\nu\\right]c^{2m+1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the velocity of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and @xmath45 is the equatorial radius of the star . from this expression , we can estimate the e - folding time @xmath46 for the growth of perturbations as follows : @xmath47\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\left(\\frac{m}{m_{\\odot}}\\right)^{-1 }      \\left(\\frac{r_1}{10\\mbox{km}}\\right)^{-2m+2 }      \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\mbox{khz}}\\right)^{-2m-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is defined as , @xmath49^{2m+1 }      ( m-1)\\left[(2m+1)!!\\right]^2 }      { 4(2\\pi)^{2m-1}(m+1)(m+2)}.\\ ] ]    this formula is applied to the neutron star models of @xmath24 with the wff3-nv eos ( table 2 ) .",
    "it is seen that , as the rotation rate is increased , the lower order modes suffer stronger destabilization effect by gravitational radiation , which originates from the efficiency of gravitational radiation of these lower order oscillations , than the higher order modes whose neutral points reside at the lower rotational frequencies . as a result",
    "these modes shown here have the same order of timescale near the mass - shedding limit .",

    ". however , qualitative behavior of the modes would be the same even if more refined treatment would be employed .",
    "inspiraling compact binary systems ( neutron star  neutron star ( ns / ns ) , black hole  neutron star ( bh / ns ) and black hole ",
    "black hole ) are the most promising sources of gravitational wave for large interferometry gravitational wave detectors under construction such as ligo and virgo ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "these detectors will be able to observe the inspiraling phase where components of the system are well approximated by the point masses . to extract meaningful results from the gravitational wave signals , it is indispensable to have sufficiently accurate theoretical templates of wave forms in the frequency range of @xmath65hz to which these detectors are sensitive ( @xcite ) .    in this context , if at least one of the components is a neutron star , its internal hydrodynamical degrees of freedom may be a potential threat to the template construction .",
    "bildsten & cutler ( 1992 ) examined the problem of the equilibrium tide and the issue of the tidal locking of the components .",
    "the tidal locking which causes synchronization of the spin and the orbital motion seems rather unlikely to occur according to their result , and the theoretical template suffers only a negligible correction by it .",
    "excitations of stellar oscillations of the inspiraling stars , or the dynamical tide , is another issue to be considered .",
    "reisenegger & goldreich ( 1994 ) and lai ( 1994 ) investigated resonant excitations of g - modes and their effects on the inspiral orbit .",
    "for slowly rotating stars g - modes frequencies may fall in the range as low as the orbital resonant frequency .",
    "according to their results , however , g - modes affect the orbit negligibly , since the coupling between tidal potential and g - mode eigenfunctions is rather weak .",
    "as we have seen , counter - rotating f - modes of neutron stars pass the neutral points viewed from the asymptotic inertial frame if the star rotates sufficiently rapidly .",
    "thus it may suffer resonant excitations during the inspiral phase .",
    "once the resonance condition is fulfilled , the f - mode is likely to be a much more dangerous obstacle to the construction of the theoretical template , since the f - mode eigenfunction couples more strongly with the tidal potential .",
    "we here adopt the simple oscillator model by reisenegger & goldreich ( 1994 ) and examine the effect of the mode excitation .    a sinusoidal external force operating on a star with a mass @xmath66 whose frequency fulfills the resonance condition , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the orbital frequency , excites a mode whose energy amounts to , @xmath69 during the resonance time interval @xmath70 , which is typically the decay time of the orbit by gravitational radiation .",
    "the external tidal force by the companion with a mass @xmath71 is estimated by the following formula : @xmath72 where @xmath45 is the stellar radius and @xmath73 is the separation of the binary system .",
    "the factor @xmath74 is the overlap integral describing the efficiency of the tidal force on an eigenfunction defined by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the determinant of the metric of the background spacetime , @xmath77 the time component of the 4-velocity of the unperturbed stellar fluid , @xmath78 is the lagrangian displacement and @xmath79 .",
    "the vibrational energy of an excited mode @xmath80 is compared with the orbital energy decrease by gravitational radiation @xmath81 in the time interval @xmath70 , @xmath82 \\left(\\frac{n_{\\mbox{\\tiny orb}}}{100\\mbox{hz}}\\right)^{\\frac{8m-23}{6 } } s^2,\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath83 depends on the mode number , the mass ratio of the components and the stellar radius .",
    "if this ratio is not negligible compared with unity , the assumption that the binary orbit evolves solely by gravitational radiation from the orbital motion should be amended .",
    "if the stellar radius and the mass ratio of the components are assumed to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the factors @xmath83 are computed as follows : @xmath86    if the mass ratio is larger , say @xmath87 ( bh / ns case ) , they are : @xmath88    the overlap integral @xmath74 may be computed by using the eigenfunction of the mode obtained by the cowling approximation . we find that @xmath89 for the bar mode and @xmath74 is larger than @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath1 modes , respectively , for all the models from the non - rotating state to the mass - shedding limit .",
    "when the star under consideration rotates in the same direction as its orbital motion , the resonance condition of counter - rotating modes and the orbital motion may be fulfilled for the states beyond the neutral points of the modes . in this case",
    ", the bar mode may not be significant except for the stars which rotate with velocities of nearly the mass - shedding limit .    as seen from figs . 1",
    " 3 , for higher order modes , the orbital frequencies at the resonances , @xmath94 , may be under @xmath95 for the realistic eos , even at the mass - shedding limit of the star . using the formula of @xmath96 above",
    ", it is observed that the higher modes than @xmath36 may not affect the orbital evolution governed by gravitational radiation during the inspiral phase which will be observed by the gravitational wave antennas like ligo / virgo .",
    "it is also seen that for systems with a large mass ratio like a bh / ns binary , the energy deposited in the ns vibration is too small to affect the binary orbit .    as for the @xmath0 mode",
    ", its excitation may affect the stability and the evolution of the system if the star has a sufficiently large rotational frequency ( for example , larger than @xmath97hz for @xmath98 ; larger than @xmath99hz for @xmath24 ) , since the vibrational energy is no more negligible compared with the gravitational radiation energy loss from the system .",
    "moreover @xmath68 at its resonance is in the range of sensitivity of ligo / virgo detectors , the excitation may be observed as the discrepancy of the signal form from its theoretical template .      if the star rotates in the retrograde direction against its orbital motion , the resonance condition of the modes and the orbit requires the rotational frequency of the star to be lower than that of the neutral points .",
    "thus the resonance condition can drop to the frequency range of ligo / virgo sensitivity windows even for lower @xmath21 modes .",
    "significant is the fact that the bar mode which couples most strongly to the tidal potential can be resonant for a wide range of rotational frequency of the star . for @xmath24 models ,",
    "stars with rotational frequency above @xmath100hz may suffer the resonant excitation on its inspiraling path in the gravitational wave antennas sensitivity window ( for @xmath98 case , this frequency may go down to @xmath101hz ) .",
    "the factor @xmath102 amounts to @xmath103 for an equal mass ns / ns binary , and to @xmath104 even in bh / ns cases with the mass ratio @xmath105 . since the overlap integral @xmath106 for the bar mode",
    ", the resonant excitation would affect the evolution of the binary orbit significantly .",
    "moreover the @xmath0 mode can be excited in the stars rotating with frequency as low as @xmath107hz ( for @xmath108 case ) .",
    "thus theoretical templates of gravitational wave signals from compact binary systems containing ns with retrograde rotation should almost always take the resonant excitation of the counter - rotating f - modes into account .",

    "figure 19 is a schematic abstraction of the situation in figure 18 . while the angular velocity is small the curve with a constant rotational frequency @xmath20 has a maximum in the allowed region , thus the mass of the mass - shedding configuration @xmath109 in figure 19 is _ smaller _ than the maximum mass @xmath110 for this value of angular frequency ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "however , for the case with sufficiently rapidly rotation , the curve with constant angular frequency shows monotonically decreasing behavior with no local maximum in the allowed region . in this case , the gravitational mass at the mass - shedding model @xmath112 is _ larger _ than that of other equilibrium models with the same rotational frequency ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "this situation corresponds to the existence of the equilibrium model with smaller @xmath27 than the mass - shedding limit in figures 14 and 15 ."
