    "gravitational waves ( gw ) are a robust prediction of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to ripples in space - time that travel at the speed of light , and are typically produced whenever an astronomically large body of mass moves at relativistic speeds like in astrophysical binary systems , or whenever large density contrast waves collide against each other , like in early universe phase transitions .",
    "the change in the orbital period of a binary pulsar known as psr 1913 + 16 was used by hulse and taylor  @xcite to obtain indirect evidence of their existence .",
    "although gravitational radiation has not been directly detected yet , it is expected that the present universe should be permeated by a diffuse background of gw of either astrophysical or cosmological origin  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical sources , like the gravitational collapse of supernovae or the neutron star and black hole binaries coalescence , also produce a stochastic gravitational wave background ( gwb ) which comes from unresolved point sources . on the other hand , among the backgrounds of cosmological origin , we find the approximately scale - invariant background produced during inflation  @xcite , or the gwb generated at hypothetical early universe thermal phase transitions  @xcite , from relativistic motions of turbulent plasmas  @xcite or from the decay of cosmic strings  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , these backgrounds have very different spectral shapes and amplitudes that might , in the future , allow gravitational wave observatories like the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite , the big bang observer ( bbo )  @xcite or the decihertz interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( decigo )  @xcite , to disentangle their origin .",
    "unfortunately , due to the weakness of gravity , this task will be extremely difficult , requiring a very high accuracy in order to distinguish one background from another .",
    "it is thus important to characterize the many different sources of gw as best as possible .",
    "recently there has been a significant improvement in the sensitivity of laser interferometers to a cosmological background of gw and there are now limits on the amplitude of this background that are just below the bbn  @xcite and cmb bounds  @xcite as recently reported by the joint ligo and virgo collaborations  @xcite .",
    "one cosmological gw background that is very well motivated by other observations is the approximately scale - invariant spectrum of gw produced from quantum fluctuations during inflation @xcite .",
    "this spectrum extends over a very wide frequency range and its amplitude is directly related to the energy density during inflation .",
    "these gw may be detected indirectly by forthcoming cmb experiments through their effect on the b - mode polarization of cmb anisotropies  @xcite , or even directly in the longer term by interferometric experiments , if inflation occurs at sufficiently high energy scales .",
    "however , if inflation occurs at lower energies , as is the case in many models motivated by high - energy physics , gw from inflation would have an amplitude that is too low to be observable . on the other hand , in case that a global phase transition took place after the end of inflation , then a scale - invariant gw background is also generated  @xcite .",
    "the detailed calculations show that the amplitude of this new gw background is two orders of magnitude greater than that expected from inflation for the same energy scale  @xcite , and thus might be detected directly by the future gw detectors or in the b - mode polarization of the cmb  @xcite .",
    "finally , another source of gw that may be relevant for interferometric experiments and whose study will be our main target here , is provided by the violent period following the end of inflation .",
    "indeed , in many models , the inflaton decays in an explosive and highly inhomogeneous way , in the process of preheating @xcite .",
    "the particular mechanism responsible for preheating is model - dependent , but it is generally dominated by a non - perturbative production of bose fields with very high occupations numbers , far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "this leads to a second , longer stage characterized by turbulent - like interactions between classical waves , before the system eventually reaches a thermal state  @xcite .",
    "the large , time - dependent fields inhomogeneities produced by preheating source a stochastic gw background  @xcite .",
    "when redshifted until today , this background may fall in the frequency range accessible by interferometric experiments if inflation and preheating occur at sufficiently low energy scales , providing an alternative to test inflation with gw .",
    "in addition , gw from preheating carry crucial information about the mostly unkown post - inflationary dynamics and , because the details of preheating depend very much on the model , they could be used in the future to discriminate between different inflationary models .",
    "gravitational waves from preheating have been intensively studied by different groups  @xcite .",
    "different numerical methods have been used in early works , see @xcite for a critical comparison , but the later results obtained by different groups agree well with each others  @xcite .",
    "two main classes of models have been studied so far : preheating after chaotic inflation and preheating after hybrid inflation . in the first case ,",
    "preheating proceeds via parametric resonance  @xcite .",
    "because inflation and preheating occur at high energy scales in these models , the resulting gw have a typical frequency today in the range @xmath1 - @xmath2 hz , which is too high for the signal to be observable by currently available experiments . on the other hand , preheating",
    "after hybrid inflation may occur at much lower energy scales and the resulting gw may fall in a frequency range below @xmath3 hz , which is accessible by high - sensitivity interferometric experiments .",
    "gw from preheating after hybrid inflation  @xcite were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the framework of parametric resonance studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was later understood that hybrid inflation models preheat in an even more violent way , due to the tachyonic amplification of fluctuations of the symmetry breaking field when the fields roll towards the true minumum of the potential , a process called tachyonic preheating  @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves from tachyonic preheating after hybrid inflation were first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and then fully explored in  @xcite , where the regions of the parameter space that may lead to an observable signal were determined .",
    "finally , it is also worth noting that the methods developed to study gw production from preheating may be applied to other out - of - equilibrium sources in the early universe .",
    "one example that is particularly interesting from the perspective of ground based interferometers is the gw background  @xcite produced by the non - perturbative decay of flat direction condensates in supersymmetric theories  @xcite  .",
    "another example is the evolution of unstable domain walls  @xcite .",
    "one common point in these works has been to focus on models involving only scalar fields  .",
    "however , in realistic models , gauge ( vector ) fields may also be copiously produced during preheating  @xcite .",
    "these lead to new terms in the anisotropic stress sourcing gw , in addition to the gradients of the scalar fields , and they may play an important role in gw production . indeed , the numerical simulations  @xcite indicate that scalar fields do not lead to a significant production of gw during the turbulent evolution towards thermal equilibrium after preheating .",
    "this was demonstrated in @xcite where it was shown that massless gauge fields may change this result .",
    "out - of - equilibrium gauge fields are of course also ubiquitous in other sources of gw , such as thermal phase transitions and local topological defects  @xcite .",
    "moreover , tachyonic preheating  @xcite could be responsible for copious production of dark matter particles  @xcite , lepto and baryogenesis  @xcite , topological defects  @xcite , primordial magnetic fields  @xcite , etc , whose observational consequences could help put more stringent constraints on the period immediately after inflation responsible for the reheating of the universe .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the gw background produced by physical models with scalar and gauge fields at preheating .",
    "we will develop numerical methods and derive theoretical results which can be applied to out - of - equilibrium gauge fields in general .",
    "we will then consider models of preheating after hybrid inflation where the symmetry breaking field is complex and coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "as we will see , a major consequence of the gauge field is to introduce new characteristic scales which are inherited by the gw spectra .",
    "this prompted us to study in detail the dynamics of the system in both fourier and position spaces .",
    "we found in particular that a crucial role is played by the dynamics of cosmic string configurations of the gauge and scalar fields . in order to probe these different scales in the simulations , we had also to develop a lattice calculation of gw with gauge fields that is accurate up to second order in the lattice spacing and timestep .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in section [ secmodel ] , we specify the model of hybrid preheating embeded in a gauge framework that we will study in this paper , briefly reviewing the fields dynamics after inflation",
    ". section [ sectheory ] is dedicated to theoretical perspectives on the effects of gauge fields on gw production from preheating . in section [ secnumerics ] , we present our numerical method to compute the gw spectra produced by scalar and gauge fields on the lattice . in section [ secspectra ] , we study in detail the dynamics of an abelian - higgs model of tachyonic preheating in fourier space and the resulting gw spectra .",
    "section [ secposition ] is dedicated to the sudy of spatial configurations in position space of both the sources and the gw themselves .",
    "we conclude in section [ secconclu ] with a summary of our results and directions for future works . in appendix",
    "[ appnogo ] , we derive a no - go result for abelian models discussed in the main text .",

    "hybrid inflation  @xcite is a class of inflationary models based on particle physics and in particular on spontaneous symmetry breaking by a scalar field .",
    "this field is coupled to a singlet scalar , the inflaton , and triggers the end of inflation when its mass - squared goes from positive to negative due to its coupling to the rolling inflaton .",
    "let us consider a generic hybrid inflation model , as described by the potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the strenght of the coupling of the inflaton @xmath6 to a symmetry breaking field @xmath7 , with self - coupling @xmath8 and vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath9 .",
    "a relevant feature of these models is that a small @xmath8 is not a prerequisite in order to generate the observed cmb anisotropies , while the scale of inflation can be choosen to range from gut scales ( @xmath10 gev ) all the way down to gev scales .",
    "depending on the particular model considered , the purely inflaton part of the potential @xmath11 can take different forms , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , and an apropiate choice of the parameters makes these models completely compatible with cmb constraints . and @xmath12 gev , @xmath13 gev , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , produces a spectrum with scalar tilt @xmath16 and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath17 , in perfect agreement at 95% c.l . with the wmap-7yr data  @xcite .",
    "other models based on logarithmic loop corrections to the flatness of the potential also give a negative tilt during inflation compatible with wmap data . ]",
    "we want to embed this setup into a gauge - invariant framework , such that the symmetry breaking field @xmath7 is coupled to the corresponding gauge fields . in general",
    ", the group of gauge symmetry could be abelian or non - abelian ( or a product of both ) and @xmath7 could even be the higgs field of the standard model with gauge symmetry @xmath18 . in the very early universe",
    "the gauge group could for instance contain multiple @xmath0 s , as described in some compactifications of string theory . in the numerical simulations ,",
    "however , we will restrict ourselves to a complex field @xmath19 coupled to a single gauge field @xmath20 , with a @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "nevertheless we will also consider other gauge groups in section [ sectheory ] , where we derive theoretical expectations about the production of gw from gauge fields .    for convenience , independently of the physical origin of @xmath7",
    ", we will often refer to this field simply as the  higgs \" of the model . in the case of a @xmath0 symmetry",
    ", we will consider the abelian - higgs model coupled to an inflaton , as described by @xmath21 with @xmath22 the background metric determinant , @xmath23 is the ( anti - symmetric ) field strength of the gauge field @xmath20 , and @xmath24 the usual covariant derivative with @xmath25 the gauge coupling . after inflation",
    ", the metric is that of a ( flat ) friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) background , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 the scale factor .",

    "numerically , we will evolve the system in the temporal gauge and use the remaining gauge degree of freedom to set @xmath45 initially .",
    "the initial conditions for the electric field are then read from satifying initially the gauss constraint ( [ gcont ] ) , see below .",
    "the abelian higgs model is known to give rise , upon symmetry breaking , to cosmic strings connecting nielsen - olesen vortices , where the higgs winds @xmath46-times .",
    "the type of string ( i and ii ) depends on the ratio of higgs to gauge field mass , @xmath47 .",
    "magnetic flux lines repel each other , while the scalar field produces an attractive force , and their range is controlled by the compton wavelength of the mediating boson . depending on which one is more massive we may have type i or type ii superconductors . for @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) the penetration depth of the magnetic field inside the string is smaller than the coherence length of the string , and local vortices are stable for arbitrary winding @xmath46 , as in type i superconductors , while for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) we have the opposite situation , and the magnetic flux lines can live inside the string ( vortices with @xmath52 are unstable in that case ) .",
    "some of the properties that we will encounter in the time evolution of the abelian higgs model after symmetry breaking in fact depends on whether the cosmic strings that are formed are type i or ii . in both cases we find cosmic strings with windings of the higgs around them , and their energy density will be a strong source for gravitational wave production .",
    "we leave for sections v and vi the detailed description of the rather complicated dynamics .",
    "the general qualitative dynamics of the system is as follows . for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is called the critical point ,",
    "the higgs field have positive mass squared and the potential has a valley at @xmath55 . during inflation",
    "the expansion is driven by the false vacuum energy , @xmath56 , while the inflaton decreases slowly along the valley due to the uplifting term @xmath57 in  ( [ eq : hybridpotential ] ) .",
    "inflation ends either when @xmath6 reaches the critical point or when the slow - roll conditions are violated , whichever occurs first . in both cases ,",
    "when @xmath58 , the effective square higgs mass becomes negative and this triggers the symmetry breaking process from @xmath59 to the true vacuum @xmath60 .",
    "the time at which the inflaton reaches @xmath61 is called the critical time @xmath62 . around that time , the inflaton s time evolution can be linearly approximated by @xmath63 , where and @xmath64 is the ( dimensionless ) inflaton s velocity at @xmath62 , @xmath65 through the higgs - inflaton coupling , the evolution of @xmath66 around @xmath61 induces a time dependence in the higgs effective mass , @xmath67 , which changes from positive at @xmath68 ( @xmath53 ) to negative at @xmath69 ( @xmath58 ) . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum evolution of the system around @xmath62 can indeed be solved exactly , as long as the non - linearities in the higgs field ( i.e.  the self - interactions of @xmath7 ) , the interactions with the inflaton fluctuations and with the gauge fields are neglected .",
    "in such a case the higgs behaves as a free scalar field with time dependent mass @xmath70 , whose quantum evolution can be solved in terms of airy functions  @xcite . when @xmath71 , the low momentum @xmath72 higgs modes grow exponentially fast due to the negative square mass , in a process known as `` tachyonic preheating ''  @xcite .",
    "this in turn sources the production of the gauge field through its interactions with the higgs .",
    "the low momentum higgs modes acquire large occupation numbers during tachyonic preheating and therefore become quasi - classical very fast .",
    "the transition from quantum to classical of the higgs long wavelength modes , takes place very rapidly indeed as compared with the time scale of the symmetry breaking process itself . this way , soon after the end of inflation but much earlier than the higgs reaches the true vaccum , the modes within the tachyonic band have become fully classical , while all other modes remain in their quantum ground state . due to the non - linear @xmath73 interaction term",
    ", the non - tachyonic modes will eventually get populated thanks to the highly occupied low - momentum modes . moreover , since the higgs and the gauge fields are directly coupled , the gauge fields are also excited during and after tachyonic preheating",
    ".    our strategy here , following  @xcite , will be therefore to introduce the system into a lattice in the precise moment in which the higgs modes within the tachyonic band have became classical ( slightly after the inflaton crossed the critical point ) but the non - linearities and other interactions are yet negligible . in order to solve for the evolution of the system we will then use the lattice approach , consisting of replacing the quantum evolution by the classical one .",
    "this way , the quantum nature of the problem remains in the stochastic character of the initial conditions .",
    "this approach is , of course , only valid in the particular scenario under study because the quantum dynamics of the low momentum modes of @xmath7 drives the system into a regime of classical field behaviour , which ultimately justifies the use of the lattice .",
    "it is the subsequent non - linear classical behaviour of the symmetry breaking field that induces the growth of the inflaton and gauge fields , which then develop a non - trivial anisotropic stress - tensor which will source gravitational waves .",
    "this approximation has the clear advantage that it fully captures the non - linear and non - perturbative nature of the problem , and allow for the use of gauge fields in a relatively simple way . the full non - linear evolution of the system",
    "can then be studied using lattice techniques , discretizing both in space and time the classical equations of all fields  ( [ xcont ] ) , ( [ acont ] ) and ( [ gcont ] ) , see subsection  [ subseclatt ] below .",
    "note that other authors have also used the lattice formulation to study hybrid preheating in the presence of gauge fields , studying some of its phenomenological consequences like baryogenesis  @xcite or the generation of the primordial seed of cosmological magnetic fields  @xcite . here , for the first time , we study the production of gw associated to the presence of such gauge fields .    finally , note that in general the model - dependent inflaton part of the potential @xmath57 does not affect significantly the dynamics of preheating , except by setting the initial velocity with which the inflaton reaches the critical point .",

    "the bubbles have already percolated and one can clearly see in the intermediate regions between bubbles , that the higgs amplitude is an order of magnitude lower than the true vev .",
    "those regions correspond to the locus of points in configuration space where a non - trivial winding has been developed , therefore leading to the formation of a spatial region where the higgs amplitude is frustated to reach the true vev .",
    "of course , we are still far away from the stationary regime describing the evolution of topological defect networks . rather , in the previous sequence of snapshots",
    ", we are looking at the dynamics of the symmetry breaking process itself , from the false to the true vaccuum , in a time scale in which the fields are still highly oscillatory and have not reached a scaling behaviour .    the growth and collisions of the higgs bubbles during symmetry breaking give rise to a significant anisotropic stress - tensor in the scalar fields , which drives the initial production of gw in this model .",

    "the covariant gradient energy of the higgs is minimized for  @xcite @xmath188 where @xmath189 is an element of u(1 ) .",
    "this induces the magnetic field to concentrate its energy density within those regions in which the higgs amplitude is smaller and phase gradients are larger .",

    "furthermore , a robust prediction of inflation is that it must have ended , converting the vacuum energy responsible for the tremendous expansion into the matter and radiation we observe today .",
    "such a process , known as reheating , is typically very violent and very inhomogeneous , with large density waves moving at relativistic speeds and colliding among each other , thus converting a large fraction of their gradient energy into gravitational waves . in some cases ,",
    "the conversion is so sudden and violent that a significant fraction of the total energy that goes into radiation ends in a stochastic background of gw , which could be detected in the future .",
    "the energy spectrum of such a gwb is very non - thermal and far from scale invariant , but actually peaked at a frequency which is related to the typical mass scale responsible for the end of inflation ( either the mass of the inflaton or that of the field that triggers the end of inflation , like in hybrid models ) , which could be orders of magnitude smaller than the hubble scale at the end of inflation . however , if the energy scale of inflation is large ( of order the gut scale ) then this stochastic gwb will be peaked at ghz frequencies , far from the present sensitivity of gw interferometers .",
    "nowadays , our only chance of detecting the gwb from reheating is to consider the low - scale models of inflation - like hybrid models - with the appropriate parameters to convert a large fraction of the initial vacuum energy into gw .",
    "the analyses done so far have considered only scalar fields whose gradient energies source the anisotropic stresses needed for gw production .",
    "however , vector fields ( gauge or not gauge ) are expected to be an even better source of gw , due to their anisotropic curl components , so that preheating scenarios with gauge fields may have a larger contribution to the gwb than scalar models .",
    "in fact , previous studies of gauge fields at preheating , in the context of electroweak baryogenesis and in the generation of primordial magnetic fields , have identified the formation of long - wave semiclassical gauge field configurations like sphalerons and helical magnetic flux tubes which evolve with time very anisotropically and could contribute significantly to the production of gw .    in this paper",
    ", we have developed a formalism to calculate the production of gw by coupled systems of scalar and gauge fields on the lattice .",
    "the numerical method that we have constructed can be applied to different sources of gw where out - of - equilibrium gauge fields play an important role , such as thermal phase transitions , cosmological networks of local defects or non - perturbative decays of scalar condensates into gauge fields .",
    "we have studied in detail the dynamics and the production of gw during preheating after hybrid inflation , in the context of abelian - higgs models that go through dynamical symmetry breaking triggered by the expectation value of the inflaton field .",
    "as the inflaton is driven slowly ( as opposed to a quench ) below the critical value , the mass squared of the abelian higgs field becomes negative and drives the spinodal growth of long - wave modes of the higgs .",
    "since the higgs is charged , its rapid growth induces a corresponding growth of gauge field configurations . at the end of inflation",
    "there are no temperature fluctuations that can induce over - the - barrier transitions . however , long - wave quantum fluctuations become semi - classical and act as a stochastic force that allow transitions over the false vacuum and thus induce ( locally ) the generation of a topological winding number of the higgs field . after symmetry breaking , there is not enough energy to unwind the higgs phase , leaving behind a nielsen - olesen string .",
    "such cosmic string configurations can be seen explicitly in our spatial distributions of both higgs and gauge fields .",
    "they play a crucial role in the production of gw at preheating and we observe that the spatial distribution of gw is indeed concentrated around the strings .",
    "those strings will eventually decay ( we see that they become wider and disperse away their energy density in the form of small - scale structures of the fields , although the winding phase around the core of the string remains , since it is topologically stable ) , which eventually shuts - off the gw production .    the complicated dynamics occurring at preheating in this abelian higgs - inflaton model has been studied using both power spectra analyses , as well as the fields distributions in configuration space , together with histograms of the fields values , as a function of time , in order to correlate the different features observed and their evolution . the picture that arises is the following . at the end of inflation the tachyonic growth of the higgs gaussian random field",
    "creates an inhomogeneous distribution of fields characterized by  bubbles \" of higgs energy density that expand and collide .",
    "the gauge field concentrates at the valleys between the bubbles , where the higgs has low values , forming long flux tubes of magnetic energy density .",
    "the dynamics of the bubles when they expand and collide leads to regions in space where the higgs field reaches the false vacuum and there are over - the - barrier transitions , with topological windings associated with them .",
    "these nielsen - olesen vortices are connected with each other in a cosmic string which runs along the core of the magnetic flux tubes .",
    "there are strings that encompass the whole simulation box and even beyond , thanks to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we observe this process both in configuration space and with the histograms of higgs vevs .",
    "we have followed the dynamics of the strings during and after the symmetry breaking , although still on time scales shorter than the hubble time and on length scales smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "once the strings are formed , they evolve by increasing their size and shedding away layers of magnetic energy density . at the cores of the strings there",
    "always remain a thin magnetic flux line but the energy seems to pour away from the strings in the form of waves concentric with the string .",
    "nevertheless , we observe ( in a transverse plane to the string ) that at the core of the string there remains a conserved winding number of the higgs .",
    "we have followed this winding number up to long times and we confirm that it is still there , in spite of the fact that the magnetic flux tube is so dilute that we can not see it coherently : it seems to have  evaporated \" .",
    "what remains is a diffuse background of small - scale structures of the higgs and gauge fields permeating the whole box , together with the remnants of the strings .",
    "the formation , evolution and fragmentation of the strings are accompanied by a significant production of gravitational waves which inherit specific features from the string dynamics . in position space",
    ", we observe how the distribution of gw follows very closely the evolution of the strings , being first concentrated around the straight segments of strings , then fattening as the strings become wider and finally being dispersed over the lattice as the strings emit small - scale structures of the fields . in fourier space , this dynamics is encoded into the successive appearance of very distinct peaks in the gw spectra .",
    "the position of each peak is directly related to the physical scales in the problem : the higgs mass , which governs the width and interactions of higgs field s strings , the gauge field mass , which governs the width and interactions of gauge field s strings , and the typical momentum amplified by tachyonic preheating , which determines the characteristic size of the bubbles when they collide and the correlation length of the straight segments of strings .",
    "the former two determine the peaks in the high momentum ( uv ) range of the spectrum , while the latter corresponds to the long - wave ( ir ) peak .",
    "the ir peak appears first , when the bubbles collide and the strings are formed , while the uv peaks are formed later on , when the strings evolve and decay into small - scale structures of the higgs and gauge fields . when the different scales are close to each other , the different peaks are superimposed and the amplitude in gw increases .",
    "when the gauge coupling constant is significantly smaller than the higgs self - coupling , the results reduce to the gw spectra produced without gauge field , characterized by a single peak .",
    "we have calculated the gw spectra produced in this abelian higgs model of preheating after hybrid inflation with state - of - the - art simulations , although still limited in spatial resolution and box sizes . in order to probe reliably the different scales in the problem in each simulation",
    ", we developed a lattice calculation of gw production with gauge fields that is accurate up to second order in the lattice spacing .",
    "our numerical results for the gw spectra today are well described by eqs .",
    "( [ f123]-[omegagw * ] ) .",
    "the present - day frequency and amplitude of these gw are very sensitive to the model parameters and the frequency of the different peaks may differ by many orders of magnitude , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sensi ] . as in the same model with only scalar fields ,",
    "very small coupling constants are still neccessary for these gw to fall into a frequency range that is accessible by interferometric experiments . whether this is natural or not depends on the underlying theory for inflation and particle - physics models of hybrid inflation with such small coupling constants have indeed been already proposed in the literature , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "we also observed that the frequency of the ir peak in the gw spectrum can be smaller than the peak frequency produced in the same model with only scalar fields , so the gauge field may enlarge the regions of the parameter space that may lead to an observable signal . more generally , there are many other models of inflation and preheating where gauge fields may play an important role and wich may lead to gw that could be observed in the future .",
    "gev ( red curve ) and @xmath209 gev , and negligible initial velocity ( blue curve ) , together with the expected sensitivity from future gwo like advanced ligo / virgo , lisa , et , bbo and decigo .",
    "note that in order to reach gwo sensitivity we had to extrapolate the position of the ir peaks using the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ irpeak ] ) , and make an educated guess for the shape of the spectra between the peaks ( dashed lines ) .",
    "also plotted are the expected gwb from a global phase transition and that from an inflationary model with tensor to scalar ratio @xmath17.,width=642 ]    after preheating the system enters into a turbulent regime where , at least in the abelian higgs model that we considered , gravitational waves are no longer produced and the gw energy density saturates .",
    "we expect this result to be rather generic in abelian scalar gauge theories , because in that case the gauge fields that are produced at preheating acquire a mass , either directly through the higgs mechanism or due to their interactions with scalar fields fluctuations . it would be interesting to study models with other gauge groups , like @xmath210 , where gauge fields remain effectively massless after symmetry breaking .",
    "this may happen for instance during preheating after hybrid inflation close to the electroweak scale ( possibly a secondary stage of inflation , not necessarily related to the cmb anisotropies , only responsible for reheating the universe ) , where the photon spectra may exhibit inverse cascade during the turbulent evolution towards thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "this could significantly lower the typical frequency of the resulting gw today and relax the conditions on the parameters for these gw to be observable .",
    "the details of the gw spectra produced from preheating should also be rather sensitive to the particular gauge group under consideration because this determines the nature of the defects that can be formed .",
    "the defects do not have to be stable since these gw are produced when they are being formed .",
    "an intriguing possibility is the following . given that preheating is so extremely inhomogeneous , and since these inhomogeneities get imprinted in the gravitational wave background , which immediately decouples from the plasma , one may envision a stage of technological development in the not so far future in which gwo with sufficient angular resolution may resolve the structures that gave rise to the gwb right at the moment when the universe reheated . in the usual preheating scenario at high energy scales with only scalar fields ,",
    "the physical structures will have today a size that is completely undetectable when projected over the sky , and thus the gwb will look essentially homogeneous from earth .",
    "however , if gauge fields with long string - like configurations ( of horizon size and possibly even with superhorizon correlations ) were behind the generation of the gwb , then one could expect to see inhomogeneities in the angular distribution of those gravitational waves .",
    "in particular , an array of gwo could detect the string - like anisotropies in the gwb across the sky . at the moment ,",
    "the angular resolution of ligo is not better than a degree projected in the sky .",
    "however , in the future one could resolve much finer structures in the gwb thanks to a dense network of ground - based laser interferometers , as proposed e.g. in ref .",
    "thinking ahead of our times , it may not be unrealistic to imagine that in the not so far future the gwb will be mastered with sufficient detail to resolve the anisotropies in this elusive background and thus recover vital information about the physics responsible for the violent conversion of energy from inflation to a radiation and matter dominated epoch ( the big bang of the old theory ) .",
    "no other probe can give us so much information , since gw decouple immediately upon production and thus retain the spatial and energy distributions of the sources that produced them .",
    "we can compare with the cosmic microwave background , which gives us detailed information about the epoch of photon decoupling thanks to the exquisite measurements of the angular correlation of both temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "the cmb provides a snapshot of how the universe was like 380,000 years after the big bang . on the other hand ,",
    "the gwb would open a window into the physics of the big bang itself , allowing us to infer from its detailed features whether it was as violent and inhomogeneous as we predict , to determine what kind of fields were present and whether the rich phenomenology that we associate with preheating ( topological defects , baryogenesis and/or leptogenesis , primordial magnetic seed creation , non - thermal production of dark matter , etc . )",

    "<S> primordial gravitational waves provide a very important stochastic background that could be detected soon with interferometric gravitational wave antennas or indirectly via the induced patterns in the polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background . </S>",
    "<S> the detection of these waves will open a new window into the early universe , and therefore it is important to characterize in detail all possible sources of primordial gravitational waves . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we develop theoretical and numerical methods to study the production of gravitational waves from out - of - equilibrium gauge fields at preheating . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider models of preheating after hybrid inflation , where the symmetry breaking field is charged under a local @xmath0 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail the dynamics of the system in both momentum and configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> we show that gauge fields leave specific imprints in the resulting gravitational wave spectra , mainly through the appearence of new peaks at characteristic frequencies that are related to the mass scales in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we also show how these new features in the spectra correlate with string - like spatial configurations in both the higgs and gauge fields that arise due to the appearance of topological winding numbers of the higgs around nielsen - olesen strings . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the time evolution of the spectrum of gauge fields and gravitational waves as these strings evolve and decay before entering a turbulent regime where the gravitational wave energy density saturates .    </S>",
