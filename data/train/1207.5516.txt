    "the epoch of reionization , which marks the end of the `` dark ages '' and the transformation of the universe from opaque to transparent , is poorly understood .",
    "it is thought that @xmath17 faint proto - galaxies were responsible for this transformation , but recent observations of @xmath18 objects ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) complicate that scenario .",
    "finding robust samples of sources , representative of the population contributing a significant amount of energetic photons , is crucial .",
    "wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on hst enables a preliminary identification of such galaxies .",
    "substantial progress has been made in detecting @xmath19 galaxies using the dropout technique @xcite , both in blank fields ( hudf , candels , e.g. , @xcite ) , and behind galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most obvious limitations of the dropout technique , however , is that unambiguously confirming the object s redshift usually requires spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "this is hard to do for typically faint high - z sources , and it is thus an area where gravitational lensing magnification helps greatly , as demonstrated in this paper .",
    "in addition to the redshift confirmation , spectroscopy provides information on properties of the interstellar and intergalactic media ( ism and igm ) . in particular ,",
    "lyman-@xmath5 emission from sources close to the reionization era is a valuable diagnostic given that it is easily erased by neutral gas within and around galaxies .",
    "its observed strength in distant galaxies is a gauge of the time when reionization was completed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we expect lyman-@xmath5 emitters ( laes ) to be predominantly dust - free galaxies ; hence their numbers should increase with redshift until the state of the igm becomes neutral , at which point their numbers should decline .",
    "significant progress has been made in detecting lyman-@xmath5 emitters ( laes ) in narrow band and spectroscopic surveys at @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most studies see a decline in the lae population at @xmath21 , but not all do @xcite .",
    "the declining fraction of laes within the lbg population @xcite is consistent with this decline being due to changes in the ism / igm , specifically to an increased amount of neutral gas .",
    "however , current studies only probe the bright end of the luminosity function of lbgs .",
    "furthermore , as noted by @xcite , and @xcite , measuring the rest frame equivalent width ( ew ) distribution of laes as a function of redshift _ and _ luminosity is a powerful tool to study reionization . the ew distribution changes with redshift and source luminosity .",
    "simulations suggest that reionization is the key factor driving this trend @xcite , because unlike continuum photons , the lyman-@xmath5 photons that escape the galactic environment are attenuated by the in the igm . with a measurement of the ew distribution in laes we can therefore help distinguish between effects of ism dust and neutral igm and study the epoch of reionization ( see also @xcite ) . the main missing observational ingredient is a measurement of the ew distribution for both luminous and sub-@xmath15 galaxies at the redshifts of reionization and this can only be achieved with spectroscopy .",
    "current spectroscopic observations unfortunately fall short of matching the extremely deep near - ir hst / wfc3 data for a significant sample of @xmath18 dropout selected galaxies .",
    "even with state of the art facilities ( e.g. the new spectrograph mosfire on keck , @xcite ) this will be a challenge . while samples of @xmath22 galaxies at @xmath23 is steadily increasing ( e.g.,@xcite for spectroscopic and imaging detections ) , to date , very few @xmath24 galaxies at @xmath25 are spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "the only examples are a lensed @xmath16 galaxy and a marginal detection at @xmath26 by @xcite . at @xmath27",
    "a @xmath28 galaxy was detected by @xcite . at @xmath29 @xcite",
    "report a marginal detection of an emission line , but independent observations do not detect it ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in prep . ) .",
    "other surveys @xcite target mostly brighter sources .",
    "it is important to increase the sample at @xmath30 and compare it to @xmath23 because the timescale for changing the number of laes and their observed ew distribution close to the reionization epoch is shorter than the interval of cosmic time between @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "a powerful way to detect emission lines from faint sources is to use galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes ( e.g,@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "gravitational lensing magnifies solid angles while preserving colors and surface brightness .",
    "thus , sources appear brighter than in the absence of lensing .",
    "the advantages of cosmic telescopes are that we can probe deeper ( due to magnification ) , sources are practically always enlarged , and identification is further eased if sources are multiply imaged .",
    "typically , one can gain several magnitudes of magnification , thus enabling the study of intrinsically lower - luminosity galaxies that we would otherwise not be able to detect with even the largest telescopes .",
    "indeed the highest redshift sub-@xmath15 lbg currently spectroscopically confirmed is the @xmath16 galaxy lensed by a cluster a1703 @xcite .",
    "observations using galaxy clusters as cosmic telescopes are consistently delivering record holders in the search for the highest redshift galaxies @xcite . for this reason",
    "we have started a large campaign of spectroscopic follow - up of @xmath33 candidates behind the best cosmic telescopes . in this paper",
    "we present the first spectroscopic confirmation from this campaign : a @xmath6 galaxy behind the bullet cluster .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the data acquisition and reduction , in section  [ sec : results ] we present the spectrum of the galaxy and we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . throughout the paper",
    "we assume a @xmath34cdm cosmology with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and hubble constant @xmath37 .",
    "coordinates are given for the epoch j2000.0 , magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     our targets were selected from deep acs / wfc3 hst observations and are presented by @xcite .",
    "we targeted all 10 @xmath1-band dropouts with the fors2 spectrograph on the eso very large telescope , program i d 088.a-0542 ( pi brada ) . here",
    "we present the first detection .",
    "the rest of the objects were not detected , inferences obtained from the non - detections and the spectra of filler slits will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "the data were taken in service mode during 2011 - 2012 november - january .",
    "we used the 600z holographic grating providing the highest sensitivity in the spectral range of @xmath38 with a resolution @xmath39 and a sampling of @xmath40 for a @xmath41 slit .",
    "the spectra presented here come from the coaddition of 42 exposures of 1400s of integration each , with median seeing around @xmath42 .",
    "series of spectra were taken with two different masks , but all our main targets were placed on both masks for a total integration time of 16.3hr .",
    "standard flat - fielding , bias subtraction , sky subtraction , and wavelength calibration have been applied as in @xcite . to perform sky subtraction",
    "we fit a polynomial to the partial spectra extracted from the slit just above and below the target and apply the fit to the full spectrum .",
    "all the sky - subtracted two - dimensional spectra ( of a mask ) were coadded in the pixel domain . finally , spectra were flux calibrated using observations of spectrophotometric standards @xcite .",
    "slit losses are small , given the extremely compact size of the targets and good seeing conditions , and have been neglected in the subsequent discussion .",
    "most of the hst imaging data of the object are presented by @xcite and summarized in table  [ tab : drops ] .",
    "in addition , we have reduced data from go 11591 ( pi kneib ) and do not detect the object in @xmath43 . all 1-@xmath4 limiting magnitudes are given in table  [ tab : drops ] .",
    "we augment the hst data with imaging data from hawk - i @xcite .",
    "the object is undetected at 3-@xmath4 in the y , nb1060 , j , and @xmath44 bands , which is consistent with our interpretation of the hst detections . for the purpose of determining photometric redshift",
    "we only use the hawk - i non - detection in @xmath44-band ( the other bands overlap with and are shallower than hst detections ) . the source is also undetected in all four spitzer irac bands ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 $ ] , @xmath47 $ ] , and @xmath48 $ ] ) with effective exposure times of @xmath49 in each filter .",
    "this is not surprising given our detection limit for this object is @xmath50}=4 $ ] at 3-@xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , existing spitzer images are too shallow to add to the quality of the photometric redshift estimate , and we only use the data listed in table  [ tab : drops ] in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] ) .",
    "for this we use the bpz code @xcite and assume uniform priors on the spectral types and redshift . the observed sed is best fit ( reduced @xmath51 ) by a young starburst ( 5 myr ) galaxy model at @xmath52 ( 95% confidence ) which is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic data presented below ( fig .  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the probability that the object is at low redshift given the set of templates used by bpz is zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phot]-right ) . forcing the solution to @xmath53 the best fit",
    "sed is an elliptical galaxy template at @xmath54 . to further discard",
    "the low - z solution would require either extremely deep f475w ( @xmath55 ) , or deeper spitzer data ; neither of which exists for this object . however , the reduced @xmath56 of the fit for @xmath53 increases by a factor of 10 compared to the high redshift solution ; in addition the object is unlikely an elliptical galaxy given the presence of an emission line ( see below ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the object is most likely at @xmath57 .",
    "we also performed an independent fit to the photometric data using the hyperz code @xcite , which has the advantage of treating internal extinction as a free parameter .",
    "the results are very similar and the probability that the object is at high redshift is @xmath58 .",
    "our conclusions are therefore robust even to cases of heavily reddened , dusty star forming galaxies like the one in @xcite .    finally ,",
    "as noted in @xcite it is difficult to estimate the size of the object given the uncertainty in measuring low surface brightness objects .",
    "the object is resolved and we estimate the fwhm of @xmath59 in @xmath60 and @xmath61 in @xmath12 . in physical units and correcting for lensing this translates to @xmath62 which is consistent with the compact sizes reported at these high redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the line is detected in two different masks and is broader than cosmic rays or residuals due to sky subtraction , hence we are confident that the line is not an artifact .",
    "the integrated flux of the line is @xmath99 , where the first error corresponds to statistical uncertainty in the detection .",
    "the second ( larger ) is due to systematic uncertainty in absolute flux calibration and due to flux losses in the proximity of skylines and was estimated based on previous multiple observations of various standard stars .",
    "no other emission lines are detected in the spectrum ( @xmath100 ) , which one would expect for some of the possible low - z solutions as discussed below .",
    "based on this and on the sed fit we exclude other alternative explanations and conclude that the line is most likely lyman-@xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "this agrees extremely well with the peak redshift probability distribution described in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] .",
    "because of the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum we can not determine whether the line is asymmetric ( which is expected for high redshift laes where absorption happens mostly in the blue wing of the line ) and thus further test our identification as lyman-@xmath5 .",
    "however , we use indirect arguments to test the alternative hypothesis that this galaxy is at a low redshift and the line is not lyman-@xmath5 but : ( 1 ) [ ] ( @xmath101 ) at @xmath102 ; ( 2 ) [ ] ( @xmath103 ) at @xmath104 ; or ( 3 ) h-@xmath5 ( @xmath105 ) at @xmath106 , which are the prominent lines in emission line galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "\\(1 ) any of the three low redshift scenarios are strongly disfavored by photometry .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : o2test]-right , the fit to the photometric data while forcing @xmath53 is very poor ( @xmath54 ) . forcing it to @xmath102 ( if line is [ ] ) , or accounting for the emission due to the line , does not change the quality of the fit .",
    "the [ ] doublet should nominally be resolved at our resolution ; however the sky emission at these wavelengths degrades s / n and our ability to distinguish individual components ( fig  [ fig : o2test]-left ) .",
    "unfortunately , in either scenario ( lyman-@xmath5/ [ ] ) no other lines are expected in the wavelength range covered by the spectrum ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the line has the rest frame ew of @xmath107 if at @xmath108 ( [ ] scenario ) and @xmath109 if at @xmath110 ( h-@xmath5 ) .",
    "this is higher than typical [ ] , and h-@xmath5 emitters equivalent widths as measured by @xcite .",
    "their median equivalent widths are @xmath111 and @xmath112 for [ ] and h-@xmath5 respectively . out of 30 [ ] emitters only 3 have equivalent width @xmath113 . hence , given the photometry and strength of the line we conclude that the [ ] scenario is very unlikely .",
    "\\(2 ) [ ] at @xmath114 is even more strongly disfavored as we would expect to detect the second line of [ ] as well as h-@xmath115 line for typical line ratios .",
    "that part of the spectra is clear , hence this identification is ruled out by the data .",
    "( 3 ) h-@xmath5 at @xmath106 is also strongly disfavored by the photometry .",
    "recently @xcite cautioned against using photometry only to select high redshift galaxies .",
    "they targeted a @xmath60-band dropout from @xcite and discovered it was a low redshift interloper .",
    "however , their situation is different from the one reported here .",
    "while their target is a @xmath60-band dropout by their selection criteria , the object is detected blueward of lyman-@xmath5 in the @xmath116-band and the resulting best - fit model is poor . even without the @xmath116-band observations the photometry can be fit with a low - z template . in our case",
    "the high redshift sed fit is good and the low redshift fit is extremely poor .    we conclude that the line is most likely lyman-@xmath5 at @xmath117 .",
    "the object has an ab magnitude of @xmath66 in the @xmath60-band ( lensed , before correcting for magnification ) , which corresponds to a continuum flux of @xmath118 . with an integrated line flux of @xmath7 ,",
    "the resulting line rest - frame equivalent width is @xmath119 ( table  [ tab : drops ] ) .",
    "the distribution of ew ( including non - detections ) of the total sample of 10 dropouts to be presented in a future paper will help distinguish between scenarios of lyman-@xmath5 opacity around the epoch of reionization @xcite .    using the data we also obtain rough estimate for the star formation rates ( sfrs ) using both lyman-@xmath5 and uv continuum luminosities , and kennicutt s relations @xcite .",
    "we first estimate the sfr from the lyman-@xmath5 luminosity @xmath120 for the case b recombination theory as @xmath121 $ ] , with @xmath122 in units of @xmath123 .",
    "we obtain @xmath124 , where errors only include measurement errors on @xmath122 and no uncertainties in kennicut s relation .",
    "note that this is a lower limit since @xmath120 is not corrected for absorption effects which depend on various parameters , including the neutral fraction of the igm and the kinematic status of neutral hydrogen .",

    "both estimates are fully compatible within systematic and statistical uncertainties implying that the dust attenuation is very low @xcite , which is also indicated by the blue uv spectral slope from @xmath131 and @xmath132 band photometry .",

    "deeper spitzer data will be needed to probe the presence of mature stellar populations in the galaxy we present here and other systems at high redshift .",
    "while this work presents only a single spectroscopic detection at @xmath30 , it nonetheless probes a very important region of parameter space . as noted above",
    ", measuring the ew distribution of laes as a function of redshift _ and _ luminosity is a very powerful tool to study reionization , because the latter is likely the key factor driving the trend of ew in luminosity @xcite .",

    "our source is the faintest one ( in line flux ) detected thus far and is only the second firm spectroscopic detection of a sub-@xmath144 source at @xmath30 . with future observations of dropouts magnified by cosmic telescopes we plan to further increase this sample .",
