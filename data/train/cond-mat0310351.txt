    "the idea to describe the stock market share prices as a random walk dates back to @xcite .",
    "he assumed that price returns @xmath1 and waiting times @xmath0 are independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) random variables which in the long time limit , according to the central limit theorem ( clt ) , conform to the normal distribution .    the properties of random walks are well understood [ see for example @xcite ] and since low - frequency market data conforms fairly well to a normal distribution the concept of a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) has been incorporated into standard economical textbooks .",
    "this approach enabled @xcite to formulate a theory of pricing financial derivatives for which they received the nobel price in economics .",
    "however there are serious problems with ctrws .",
    "the observed probability density function ( pdf ) of price returns @xmath4 shows considerable discrepancies from a gaussian [ @xcite ] in particular it exhibits power law tails for large values of @xmath1 . @xcite and @xcite managed to generalize bachelier s approach by introducing lvy distributions @xmath5 with the normal distribution being only a particular representative of these .",
    "lvy distributions , functions labeled by two real parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , are limit distributions for sums of independent random variables which emerge in the generalized clt @xcite . taking @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 ensures that the functions are both positive , even @xmath10 , behave like a steep gaussian for small values of @xmath1 and decay according to a pareto s power law much slower than a gaussian for large @xmath1 s . despite technical problems , the second moment being infinite for @xmath11",
    ", these functions have been successfully used to model relaxation processes ( die - electrical , mechanical and nmr ) @xcite and in the theory of probability @xcite .",
    "recently , an investigation of about 40 million price quotes at the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) @xcite showed that the cumulative probability density of price returns @xmath12 behaves like @xmath13 with @xmath14 which yields a value of @xmath15 beyond the valid range @xmath16 if the pdf were to be modeled by a lvy distribution .",
    "lvy distributions are well defined for @xmath17 but can take negative values in that regime hence are not good candidates for pdfs .",
    "furthermore in most treatments so far it is assumed that price returns @xmath1 are independent of waiting times @xmath0 .",
    "this does not seem to be the case @xcite and it also seems counterintuitive .",
    "one would expect larger price variations to correspond to larger waiting times since one would expect it to be more difficult , take more time , for a broker to find buyers and sellers that balance out supply and demand if the price variation is larger than if it was smaller .",
    "such simplified reasoning implies that there should be a positive correlation between @xmath1 s and @xmath0 s which has not been taken into account in many works on this subject .",
    "in this paper we will generalize the theory to take account of these two difficulties .",
    "we will drop the assumption that @xmath1 s and @xmath0 s are independent random variables but still retain the property of independence of variables corresponding to different times . by assuming that it is a certain function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 that conforms asymptotically to the lvy distribution rather than either price returns or waiting times themselves we will work out the joint pdf @xmath2 .",
    "theoretical results will be compared to some high - frequency market data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we formulate our theory and work out analytical formulas for pdfs and cumulative pdfs under various assumptions about how price returns and waiting times are correlated . in section [ sec : mastereq ] we set up an equation for the probability @xmath18 of having price @xmath1 at time @xmath0 and show that price evolution does not satisfy the markovian property .",
    "we compare our evolution equation to that worked out under different assumptions @xcite .",
    "finally in sections [ sec : cumuldistr ] , [ sec : goodfit ] and [ sec : correl ] we fit the cumulative pdfs of high - frequency exchange rate and low - frequency @xmath19th century stock data to our theory , discuss the goodness of fit and assess whether the correlations between @xmath1 s and @xmath0 s which follow from our theory conform to market data .",
    "in the following we will adhere to the convention that random variables are denoted by capital letters and values of random variables by lower - case letters .",
    "the objective is to work out the joint pdf of price returns and waiting times @xmath2 under the assumption that the random variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 are not independent . the first idea which comes into a mind of a physicist",
    "is to assume a weak dependence and to develop a perturbative approach .",
    "one could for example consider the correlation coefficient between @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 - e[x]e[t]}{\\sqrt{e[x^2 ] - e[x]^2 } \\sqrt{e[t^2 ] - e[t]^2}}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 $ ] being the mean of @xmath24 and minimize it as a functional of the joint pdf @xmath2 subject to an assumption that the pdf belongs to a certain functional space , ie is a linear combination of certain basis functions .",
    "however , since it is rather unclear how to choose these functions we will develop a different approach .",
    "we assume that it is not the price return @xmath1 or the waiting time @xmath0 that conforms to a lvy distribution but that a certain function @xmath25 has that property .",
    "this means that there exists a random variable @xmath26 , which depends on the random price returns @xmath20 and waiting times @xmath21 , the change of which in the time period @xmath27 $ ] takes , for large @xmath28 , the following form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a random variable conforming to a lvy distribution with parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : genclt ] ) is a statement of the generalized clt under the assumption that the increments @xmath31 are i.i.d random variables .",
    "we also assume that instead of one stock there can be a set of stocks @xmath32 the prices of which are correlated with each other and so @xmath26 depends on all stock price returns @xmath33 , ie @xmath34 , and @xmath26 conforms to the lvy distribution ( [ eq : genclt ] ) .    in order to work out the distribution @xmath2 of the returns and waiting times we consider a transformation of variables in the @xmath35-dimensional space with cartesian coordinates @xmath36 : @xmath37 we require the elementary probabilities @xmath38 to be conserved : @xmath39 where @xmath40 for @xmath41 are certain functions of the variables @xmath42 which we set equal to one @xmath43 .",
    "now the problem is to make a proper choice of the function @xmath44 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath24 is a hypotenuse in a right triangle with edges of lengths @xmath45 and @xmath0 ( see fig.[fig : randwalk ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath46 and the most natural transformation ( [ eq : mapping ] ) that comes into mind here is a mapping into spherical polar coordinates @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the jacobian of the transformation ( [ eq : trafoi ] ) reads : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and the joint pdf of price returns and waiting times reads : @xmath53    integrating over all @xmath54 values with a fixed modulus @xmath1 we obtain the pdf @xmath2 which corresponds to the length of the vector of price returns @xmath55 and to the waiting time @xmath0 : @xmath56 in equation ( [ eq : jointpdf ] ) we applied a mapping into spherical polar coordinates in @xmath57-dimensional space @xmath58 the jacobian of which , according to equation ( [ eq : jacobian ] ) , reads : @xmath59    finally we work out the cumulative density of waiting times + @xmath60 and that of price returns",
    "@xmath61 : @xmath62 now , the double integral on the right - hand - side in ( [ eq : cumuldistr1 ] ) is computed by going to polar coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the cumulative density @xmath65 reads : @xmath66 where @xmath67 . since the marginal pdfs @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath69 take the same form , it is readily seen that the joint pdf in ( [ eq : jointpdf ] ) does not change when @xmath1 and @xmath0 are mutually exchanged , the cumulative density of returns @xmath70 is given by the same formula as ( [ eq : waitingtimedistrfct ] ) except that @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath1 .",
    "let us also write down the large @xmath0 expansion of the cumulative density .",
    "@xmath71 where @xmath72 is the beta function .",
    "the expansion ( [ eq : waitingtimedistrfctexp ] ) evaluated by making use of an asymptotic expansion of the lvy function and may be useful for numerical calculations of @xmath65 for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with a different assumption for the function @xmath24 .",
    "assume that it is the sum of moduli of price returns and the waiting time that conforms to the lvy distribution @xmath73 .",
    "looking at fig.[fig : randwalk ] one could say that it is the sum of neighboring horizontal and vertical sections @xmath74 in one knee of the random staircase that conforms to the lvy distribution in large time limit .",
    "the transformation of variables ( [ eq : mapping ] ) is now given by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the jacobian reads @xmath78 and the joint pdf takes the form @xmath79 . the joint pdf @xmath2 which depends on the modulus of the @xmath54 vector in the @xmath80 norm @xmath81 reads : @xmath82 the cumulative probability distribution of waiting times @xmath65 reads : @xmath83 and that of price returns @xmath70 takes the form : @xmath84    for both cases considered above the cumulative density of either waiting times of price returns takes the form : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 and the kernels @xmath88 depend on the function @xmath89 and on the number of stocks @xmath57 .",
