    "the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) is one of the most relevant equations in physics .",
    "this integrable equation can be rigorously derived as an approximation to governing equations of several nonlinear and dispersive media @xcite .",
    "recently , a wide class of solutions , such as the peregrine soliton @xcite and multi - peregrine soliton , also referred to as akhmediev - peregrine breathers @xcite , of the nls are intensively discussed in physical and mathematical communities @xcite .",
    "the doubly - localized peregrine soliton , which approaches a non - zero constant background in the infinite limit of the spatial and temporal periodicity , amplifies the amplitude of the carrier by factor of three at the co - ordinates origin .",
    "multi - peregrine solitons @xcite have similar dynamics , with the particular property to generate much higher maximal peak amplitudes , compared to background @xcite . due to these properties , peregrine - type waves",
    "are suggested to model  rogue waves \" ( rws ) , known to appear in the ocean @xcite and in other media @xcite . mathematically speaking , modulationally",
    "unstable extreme waves admit high - intensity peaks , appearing from nowhere and disappearing without a trace , while evolving in time and space @xcite . recently",
    ", exact solutions of the nls , describing a new form of modulation instability dynamics , have been derived @xcite .",
    "the concept of the rws was first discussed in the studies of ocean waves @xcite , and gradually extended to other fields of research , such as for instance for capillary water waves @xcite , optical fibers @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite , which have been summarized in very recent review papers @xcite .",
    "only recently , experimental validation of such rw model has been successfully conducted in nonlinear fibers @xcite , in water wave tanks @xcite , and in plasmas @xcite .",
    "the latter experimental studies have been performed based on the nls modeling evolution equation .",
    "in addition to the nls , there are several other integrable evolution equations admitting peregrine - type rw solutions such as the hirota equation , the modified korteweg - de vries equation , the sasa - satsuma equation , the fokas - lenells equation , the nls maxwell - bloch equation , the hirota maxwell - bloch equation , the generalized nls , the vector nls , the derivative nls , the variable coefficient nls and derivative nls , the davey - stewartson equation , and the kp - i equation @xcite . lately",
    ", fundamental rogue wave modes of the mixed chen - lee - liu derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation ( cll - nls ) @xcite @xmath0 have been reported @xcite by use of the hirota bilinear method . clearly , the latter solution is physically more complex and more accurate in describing the propagation of optical pulses compared to the nls or simplified cll eq .",
    "@xcite @xmath1 since the cll - nls takes into dispersion , nonlinearity as well as self - steepening effect ( sse ) , described by the term @xmath2 , however , while ignoring self - phase - modulation ( spm ) @xcite .",
    "the sse of light pulses , originating from their propagation in a medium with an intensity dependent index of refraction , was first introduced in @xcite and was observed in optical pulses with possible shock formation @xcite .",
    "it receives a significant attention for the propagation of electromagnetic waves in nonlinear fibers , using a femtosecond laser , since it plays a crucial role in the generation of supercontinuum @xcite . in mathematical terms , its source is the first nonlinear correction to the nls in the description of very focused light pulses or significant sharp water wave packets for which the validity of the nls is known to be violated , due to the related significant broadening of the spectrum @xcite . in hydrodynamics",
    ", the cll - nls can be obtained from the modified nls , also known as the dysthe equation @xcite by ignoring the mean flow term , whose contribution is small if the nonlinearity of the wave train is kept small .",
    "therefore , exact cll - nls models may motivate experiments in nonlinear optical fibers as well as in water wave flumes @xcite .",
    "especially , taking into account the fact that exact rw solutions are closely related to the modulation instability of weakly nonlinear dispersive waves .    in this paper , we report exact solutions of the integrable cll - nls . to the author s best knowledge , this is so far the first derivation of such doubly - localized solutions using the dt . in section 2 and section 3",
    "the integration scheme will be introduced and we will address the significant challenges using the dt , solving cll - type equations .",
    "these major difficulties are the result of the corresponding asymmetry of the lax pair , see details in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "exact solutions with particular focus on higher - order rws is reported in section 4 , extending therefore the family of exact first - order solutions .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the influence of the sse on the localization properties of nls rws in section 5 . due to obvious physical relevance of the cll - nls",
    ", we emphasize further analytical , numerical and experimental studies , related to the presented exact solutions of this integrable evolution equation .",

    "[ contour ] .",
    "since the contour line is not closed on the background in the length - direction , we have to select a contour @xmath319 with height twice the background such that it is closed .",
    "the closed contour is useful to discuss the localization characters of the the first - order rw .",

    "two curves for @xmath320 and @xmath321 with fixed @xmath264 are given in fig .",
    "[ ld2d](a ) .    in order to consider the contribution of the sse on the localization characters of the rw",

    "better _ than the corresponding nls one . from an experimental point of view , having a smaller localization , we emphasize therefore a simpler set - up , since the proapgating distance of first - order cll - nls rw is considerably smaller compared to the nls case .",
    "the opposite case is valid for @xmath365 and @xmath366 , where the cll - nls rw is _",
    "worse_. unfortunately , we have not been able to compare the localization properties , when @xmath297 belongs to one of the other two intervals , shown in the third and fifth column of table @xmath259 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the width and length of the corresponding localization is alternatively smaller or bigger for the cll - nls compared to the nls . in other words , the sse in the cll - nls gives a remarkable change of the localization properties of the first - order rw , although we are not able to claim , if the rw localization for this equation is rather improved or destroyed by this term at different points @xmath367 , in the parameter space .",
    "this is the first impact of the sse on rw solutions of the cll - nls . as second impact",
    "we emphasize is that the sse induces a strong rotation of the direction length on the rw of the cll - nls by comparing the two lines @xmath316 and @xmath344 .",
    "these two impacts are demonstrated intuitively by contours at a height @xmath368 of the modulus square for the first - order rws of the cll - nls and of the nls in fig .",

    "<S> the the mixed chen - lee - liu derivative nonlinear schrdinger equation ( cll - nls ) can be considered as simplest model to approximate the dynamics of weakly nonlinear and dispersive waves , taking into account the self - steepnening effect ( sse ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effect arises as a higher - order correction of the nonlinear schrrdinger equation ( nls ) , which is known to describe the dynamics of pulses in nonlinear fiber optics , and constiutes a fundamental part of the generalized nls . </S>",
    "<S> similar effects are decribed within the framework of the modified nls , also referred to as the dysthe equation , in hydrodynamics . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we derive fundamental and higher - order solutions of the cll - nls by applying the darboux transformation ( dt ) . </S>",
    "<S> exact expressions of non - vanishing boundary solitons , breathers and a hierarchy of rogue wave solutions are presented . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we discuss the localization characters of such rogue waves , by characterizing their length and width . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we describe how the localization properties of first - order nls rogue waves can be modified by taking into account the sse , presented in the cll - nls . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by use of an analytical and a graphical method . </S>",
    "<S> the results may motivate similar analytical studies , extending the family of the reported rogue wave solutions as well as possible experiments in several nonlinear dispersive media , confirming these theoretical results .     </S>",
