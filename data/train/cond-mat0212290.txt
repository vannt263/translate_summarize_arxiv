    "superfluidity is one of the most dramatic illustrations of the quantum nature of matter .",
    "it is exemplified in its purest form in bose - einstein condensation @xcite of cold atomic gases .",
    "the quantisation of angular momentum associated with the phase of the quantum fluid has been established through the nucleation of vortices @xcite recently extending to the observation of large vortex lattice structures with grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "experiments have also revealed collective irrotational oscillatory flows in the superfluid phase @xcite that revert to thermal flow modes and frequencies above the critical temperature .",
    "one of the fundamental properties of a pure quantum fluid is the coherence of the phase of the wavefunction @xcite where different regions of the condensate are phase - locked in their motion .",
    "for example , in the flow of an condensate past an obstacle , the requirement of upstream and downstream continuity in mass transport and phase gradient explains the capacity for superfluid flow @xcite , and the transition to dissipation when local phase slip arises . for homogeneous and inhomogeneous condensates ,",
    "there is conclusive evidence , both theoretical and experimental , that the nucleation of vortices is the primary mechanism responsible for the onset of drag and dissipation in condensate flow @xcite .",
    "phase coherence is responsible for the quantisation of circulation ( angular momentum ) and the capacity of the fluid to conserve its state of rotation unless acted upon by a critical external moment .",
    "consequently , it was predicted @xcite that a bose - condensed gas could be made to exhibit gyroscopic motion . very recently",
    "this phenomenon has been observed experimentally @xcite and measured for the first time . in analogy with a spinning top , slightly displaced from equilibrium by an impulsive moment , a slight tilt of the axis of rotation ( figure [ figure_1 ] ) produces precessional and nutational motion . in this paper",
    "we show that internal flows past the vortex create a magnus force which results in precession , and that this combined with the inhomogeneity in the condensate gives rise to vortex bending and twisting into helical modes of oscillation .",
    "the quantum gyroscope is also a unique diagnostic tool able to probe condensate flow velocities , acoustic waves , and pressures .",
    "the oscillating and twisting motion of a vortex , as we will show , is highly sensitive to density fluctuations and inhomogeneities . in this paper",
    "we study the dynamics of a single - quantum vortex lying near the axis of a cylindrically symmetric trap . in our study",
    "we have employed four different methods of analysing the motion : ( a ) the bogoliubov - de gennes equations ( b ) the gross - pitaevskii equation , ( c ) hydrodynamic equations , and ( d ) classical equations . while methods ( a ) and ( c ) are essentially linearisations of ( b ) , they are extremely important in identifying the underlying modes of excitation .",
    "we study the collective modes of the system and compare with recent hydrodynamic theory .",
    "we find that while many features of the gyroscopic motion are described by the hydrodynamic model , the vortex motion is significantly different .",
    "firstly , the frequencies of precessional motion are shifted from the hydrodynamic predictions , secondly the vortex core has a single kink , and thirdly the vortex performs a helical kelvin wave oscillation of mode @xmath1 not previously seen .",
    "for a cold weakly - interacting gas , the ground state ( condensate mode ) dominates the collective dynamics of the system . in experimental realizations",
    "one can achieve temperatures such that @xmath2 ( typically @xmath3 to @xmath4 ) and densities such that the gas is weakly interacting and highly dilute . under such conditions ,",
    "the condensate of @xmath5 atoms is well described by a mean field , or wavefunction , governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation , and the quasiparticle excitations are acoustic waves within this field .",
    "if the perturbations of the condensate are small , then it is appropriate and convenient to use the linear response approximation , which is equivalent to the bogoliubov approximation for single - particle excitations in highly - condensed quantised bose gases at zero temperature .    )",

    "consider firstly the scissors @xmath222 or @xmath223 mode of oscillation ; the quadrupole moment results are presented in figure [ figure_3 ] and the corresponding frequency spectrum in figure [ figure_4 ] .",
    "data obtained using the direct solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation are compared with the coherent hydrodynamic calculation , and the classical top results .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath9 with @xmath17 atoms and @xmath43 translate to : @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 . considered as a classical rigid top , the condensate , viewed along the @xmath227-direction will exhibit quadrupole oscillations due to nutation . if the top precesses then this moment vanishes each time the axis nutates along the @xmath179-plane . using equation ( [ qclass ] ) , the classical moment @xmath228 oscillates with a carrier frequency @xmath229 , and carrier amplitude @xmath230 .",
    "the classical prediction for the beat period of the @xmath212 quadrupole , is in fairly good agreement with the unperturbed coherent hydrodynamic results @xmath231 as shown in figure [ figure_3 ] .",
    "neither of these results compare well with the more accurate lower - frequency result from the gross - pitaevskii equation : @xmath232 .",
    "the lower beat ( precession ) frequency ( figure [ figure_3 ] ) contrasts with higher mode frequencies compared with the hydrodynamic limit , as illustrated in figure [ figure_4 ] . in figure [ figure_7 ]",
    "it is clear that , for @xmath6 , the curves ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) corresponding to these modes have not reached the asymptotic limit @xmath103 .",
    "very recently measurements of vortex precession @xcite in a trap were made under the following conditions @xmath233 , @xmath234 hz , and @xmath235 atoms .",
    "this corresponds to an interaction strength @xmath236 which is within the hydrodynamic regime but should exhibit quantal effects .",
    "the classical precession frequency is @xmath237 where the error is due to the uncertainty in @xmath17 .",
    "a calculation using the gross - pitaevskii equation gives @xmath238 .",
    "as in the case previously discussed ( @xmath9 , @xmath6 ) this rate of precession is slightly lower than the classical / hydrodynamic prediction .",
    "the equivalent frequencies for the vortex precession are @xmath239 and @xmath240hz .",
    "measurements were performed by imaging the vortex line in the horizontal plane and trap tilting along both the @xmath179 and @xmath210 planes and were in good agreement .",
    "taking the average of the results gives the experimental estimate @xmath241 ; a slightly faster rate of precession than the quantal prediction , and more in line with hydrodynamic theory .",
    "while the limitations of zero temperature models , as described in this paper , are well known , the hydrodynamic approximation is generally less accurate than the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "moreover , important effects neglected by this model are the viscous effects of the thermal fluid , as observed @xcite",
    ". however , these effects would probably reduce @xmath242 further and thus increase the gap between experiment and theory .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that two other effects might have a role in explaining the differences .",
    "firstly , the possibility of off - centre precession @xcite and secondly , the influence of additional edges vortices @xcite might have significant effects . while the results of the observations and the theory outlined above are in very good agreement",
    ", there is a considerable margin for improving the simulations to study the contribution of these effects and of the influence of thermal damping .",
    "considering some of the other modes , we note that this scissors excitation of the vortex state weakly populates a low - frequency mode at @xmath243 ; on figure [ figure_4 ] and labelled line ( 3 ) , and also marked on figure [ figure_7 ] .",
    "this is the lowest @xmath15-dipole mode @xmath244 .",
    "the variation of frequency of the mode is given in table [ table_1 ] and drawn in figure [ figure_7 ] .",
    "checks on the numerical accuracy of the numerical methods were also provided by studying the centre - of - mass modes whose frequencies remains constant as the particle number or interaction strength @xmath84 varies ; a consequence of the kohn theorem @xcite , figure [ figure_7 ] .",
    "we note the labelling of axial excitation modes @xmath245 and @xmath246 , reflects the quadrupole symmetry in the hydrodynamic regime .",
    "values of the @xmath247 mode frequency are given in table [ table_1 ] , in which the highly accurate bogoliubov de - gennes results are compared with results using the time - dependent linear response method @xcite .",
    "this confirms the accuracy both of the direct time - dependent method and the linear response approximation .",
    "kelvin modes are self - induced helical waves of a vortex line and have a well - established dispersion relation for infinite homogeneous fluids @xcite . however , in a trapped condensate , the finite boundaries means these modes are quantised , and the inhomogeneity of the condensate means that the fluid pressure varies along the vortex line . the signature of the kelvin modes is the distortion of the vortex line and can be detected in the gyroscope motion .",
    "the lowest - order and most strongly - coupled modes , @xmath0 , are excited by the small angle rotation of the trap .",
    "since the modes @xmath248 and @xmath249 are populated in approximately equal weights this leads to a kink in the vortex in the vertical plane .",
    "the bending and twisting of the vortex line is more pronounced at the low - density low - pressure edges of the condensate ( figure [ figure_2 ] ) .",
    "analysis of the horizontal plane quadrupole moment @xmath250 shows periodicity but irregularity ( figure [ figure_5 ] ) .",
    "the two - mode classical theory , equation ( [ qclass ] ) , strongly disagrees with the quantal results shown in figure ( [ figure_5 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of oscillation is much larger than classically predicted , and is associated with the vortex @xmath21-shape outward bend .",
    "however the main feature is the quantal oscillations that indicate twisting , that is bending of the vortex projected onto the @xmath250 plane .",
    "the horizontal - plane spectrum ( figure [ figure_6 ] ) is dominated by two pairs of lines labelled ( a , b ) and ( c , d ) .",
    "figure [ figure_7 ] and table [ table_1 ] indicate the frequency variation , with atom number @xmath84 , of the helical modes .",
    "the lines ( c ) and ( d ) are the quadrupole pair @xmath251 and @xmath252 , respectively . in the hydrodynamic limit with @xmath147 they corresponds to the doubly - degenerate @xmath253-quadrupole with frequency , @xmath254 .",
    "the correlation of the pair ( c ) and ( d ) to the ideal gas states @xmath255 and @xmath256 , is shown in figure [ figure_6 ] .",
    "the splitting of this quadrupole pair @xmath257 is a signature of vortex precession , though again it is substantially smaller than the classical prediction @xmath258 associated with a rigid vortex crossing the @xmath259 and @xmath208 planes during precession .",
    "the dominance of mode ( c ) over ( d ) is apparent ( figure [ figure_6 ] ) and means the vortex has a positive helicity of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , the strong coupling of @xmath260 states with vortex motion has been used to measure the angular momentum of the vortex state @xcite .",
    "the pair of high - frequency lines ( a ) and ( b ) also contribute strongly to the spectrum .",
    "these are the dipole - like modes @xmath261 and @xmath262 , degenerate as @xmath80 with symmetry @xmath263 and @xmath264",
    ". the pair of lines are of approximately equal weighting and therefore cancel helicities . as @xmath265",
    ", these lines converge slowly towards the common limit @xmath266 .",
    "finally the spectrum shows two low - intensity lines at @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "these are not new modes but rather vestiges of the @xmath212 modes ; the low frequency line being the beat frequency corresponding to the splitting of lines ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in figure [ figure_4 ] , and the higher frequency line , the frequency difference of modes ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the gyroscopic dynamics of a trapped bose - einstein condensate containing a vortex .",
    "we modelled the system using a classical top description and numerically by solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we also compared our results with the hydrodynamic approximation .",
    "the linear - response equations for the system were solved giving the excitation spectra and amplitudes .",
    "the superfluid precession and nutation of the vortex were found to display quantum frequency shifts .",
    "the precession frequency was calculated and found to be consistent with recent experiments , though a small discrepancy exists . vortex bending and twisting modes of excitation were observed .",
    "we found , in the scissors excitation of the vortex state , that vortex bending in the vertical plane is associated with the @xmath0 modes of oscillation , while the helical oscillation , vortex twisting , is dominated by the @xmath1 kelvin mode .",
