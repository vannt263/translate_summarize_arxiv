    "if the length and width of the sample are both @xmath117 nm , this means that the chern number can be tuned by varying @xmath118 within 10mv .",
    "the ability to tune the topological phase transition with such a small electric field offers hope that such a logic devices based on piezoelectric deformation of a tci could possess on / off ratios and sub - threshold slopes which far exceed current logic device technologies .",
    "in the derivation of the main results , we have ignored physical factors of ( i ) the impurities and ( ii ) the electron - electron interaction .",

    "mirror symmetries are broken and the mirror chern number is not a good quantum number , and consistently , the gapless modes at the dirac points are gapped by impurity scattering .",
    "this mirror symmetry breaking by impurity has , however , no effect on the chern number in a ferromagnetically doped system , as long as the intensity of the random potential is much smaller compared with the zeeman gap .",

    "a strain along @xmath121$]-direction breaks both the @xmath34 and the @xmath12 mirror planes , opening two gaps of opposite signs at the two dirac points .",
    "when both the strain and the zeeman field are present , a discussion similar to the one given in sec.[sec : strain ] shows that the chern number can be either @xmath11 or @xmath120 . on the @xmath122-surface",
    ", there are four dirac cones centered at @xmath15 and three @xmath123 s .",
    "the three dirac points at @xmath123 have the same energy due to the threefold rotation symmetry about the @xmath124$]-axis , while the one at @xmath15 generically has a different energy .",
    "this energy difference among the dirac points , which has been measured to be @xmath125mev in ref .",
    "[ ] , makes it hard to have a fully gapped surface using an induced zeeman field , because the zeeman gap is generically much smaller than @xmath126mev .",

    "in general , the @xmath30 model is given by h_1(q)=d_0(q)i_22+d_x(q)_x+d_y(q)_y+d_z(q)_z , which must satisfy the symmetry constraints : m_1|10h_1(q_1,q_2)m^-1_1|10&=&h_1(q_1,-q_2 ) , + = 0 .",
    "these symmetry constraints give that ( 1 ) @xmath139 is even under @xmath140 , ( 2 ) @xmath141 is odd under @xmath140 and ( 3 ) @xmath142 to arbitrary order .",

    "these terms make the dispersion deviate from perfectly linear and may be understood as the ` warping ' terms ; they also make corrections to the wave functions at each @xmath44 . it should be noted that @xmath142 holds up to arbitrary orders and this means there is no out - of - plain pseudo - spin component at any @xmath44 . while including higher order terms",
    "explains the shape - changing of the equal energy contours from perfect ellipsoids , the lifshitz transition can not be described in the framework of any two - band theory .",
    "to do so , the model must be extended a four - band one , in order to account for the hybridization between nearest cones , as discussed in ref .",
    "in the main text , we mention that by 90-degree rotations the effective theories for the four cones can be related .",
    "this is an intuitive statement yet to be made precise .",
    "in fact , @xmath30 theories are always written with respect to a chosen basis , which is our case is furnished by ( the periodic part of ) the two bloch states that are degenerate at the dirac point . due to the degeneracy , there is a gauge degree of freedom in the choice . here",
    "the choice is made by fixing the little group representation at @xmath33 : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "if we denote the two basis states by @xmath143 and @xmath144 , we then fix the bases at @xmath53 to be @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively . mark that here @xmath148 is the matrix representing the 90-degree rotation in both orbital space ( including spin ) . defining the bloch wave function at @xmath149 as @xmath150 , it is easy to check that @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . here",

    "the chern number of a whole 2d surface ( top surface for example ) is , however , a well - defined quantity ( if periodic boundary is taken for the other two directions ) , which may be calculated .",
    "suppose we are interested in the chern number , @xmath1 , at some zeeman field @xmath160 .",
