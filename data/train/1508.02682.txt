    "the study of topological phases of quantum systems has flourished in recent years , thanks to theoretical and experimental discoveries of several families of such phases in artificial nanostructures as well as bulk crystals .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the phases of matter characterized by broken symmetries , such as ferromagnets vs. paramagnets or solids vs. liquid , topological phases of electronic matter are characterized by the nontrivial topology of their electrons wavefunctions . in particular",
    ", a topological phase can not be distinguished from a normal phase by probing its bulk electronic properties locally .",
    "for example , a topological insulator does not allow the passage of electric current through it just like a normal insulator ; however , as one changes the momentum the electronic wavefunctions in a topological insulator exhibit a nontrivial twist .",
    "this twist can not be undone by changing the parameters of the system unless the system is brought to a critical phase at which it becomes a metal .",
    "@xcite this characterization also implies that at the boundary between a topological phase and a normal phase , the electronic motion must undergo a drastic change .",
    "for instance , the electronic states at the boundary of a topological and a normal insulator are metallic . in other words ,",
    "one expects that at the boundaries of the system in a topological phase there are bound states , protected by symmetry , that emerge because of the nontrivial topology of the bulk .",
    "this statement is commonly referred to as the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "though crystals are described microscopically in terms of their lattice structure , it is often more convenient to describe these systems in a continuum representation . such a description is relevant for the long - distance behavior of the system , i.e. , phenomena that occur at distances much larger than the characteristic lattice constant .",
    "these include the quantum phases of the system .",
    "it is also a more general description since different lattice systems can end up having the same continuum description and , thus , the same long - distance physics .",
    "as is generically the case in quantum systems , continuum descriptions involve unbounded operators such as the linear momentum .",
    "usually this does not present a major obstacle since one may regularize such operators by restricting their action to square - integrable wavefunctions that vanish sufficiently fast at infinity .",
    "however , in order to illustrate the bulk - boundary correspondence in a topological phase , one must study the properties of the system near the boundaries . in this case",
    ", one needs to regularize the unbounded operators differently .",
    "intuitively , this regularization can be seen to involve the boundary conditions of the electronic wavefunctions .",
    "mathematically , it requires the notion of self - adjoint extensions of unbounded hermitian operators .  @xcite    there is already a well - developed theory of self - adjoint extensions",
    ";  @xcite however , its application to , and consequences for , the continuum description of topological phases remains obscure . in this paper",
    ", we illustrate this application in the context of a concrete and simple model of a topological phase . from a pedagogical standpoint ,",
    "topological phases provide a very natural setting for learning and using self - adjoint extensions .",
    "it is a topic that brings together several strands of modern physics and mathematics : many - body quantum systems ; symmetries of a physical system ; topology ; and functional analysis .",
    "we present a pedagogical and accessible exposition of these subjects in the context of a simple model of a ferromagnetic insulator with spin - orbit interactions .",
    "we also clarify the role of symmetry and boundary conditions in self - adjoint extensions of an operator .",
    "in particular , we show that the notion of bulk - boundary correspondence depends on the choice of self - adjoint extension .",
    "finally , we provide a physical interpretation of self - adjoint extensions in terms of a conserved current associated to the hermitian operator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : qw ] we introduce a model of a one dimensional lattice that exhibits normal and topological phases over a range of parameters . in section  [ sec : cl ] we present a pedagogical derivation of the continuum , field - theory description of this model with boundaries , and point out the difficulty of dealing with unbounded operators . in section  [ sec : sae ] we review von neumann s theory of self - adjoint extensions of a hermitian operator . in section  [ sec : tbs ] we use this theory to obtain the self - adjoint extensions of the continuum hamiltonian and its topological bound states .",
    "we also discuss the effect of a symmetry operation on the self - adjoint extension . in section  [ sec : curr ] we recast the self - adjoint extensions of arbitrary hermitian operators in terms of a conserved , spatially local current .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the technical details are presented in three appendices .",
    "consider a system of spin-@xmath0 fermions moving along a line with a periodic array of potential wells , for example electrons moving through a chain of ions , subject to an external or internal magnetic field and an internal spin - orbit interaction .",
    "when the separation between the ions is large enough so that only the quantum tunneling between nearest ions is appreciable , one can model this system as a discrete chain with the hamiltonian ,  @xcite @xmath1 + \\text{h.c.}.\\ ] ] here , `` @xmath2 '' means one must add the hermitian conjugate of all the previous terms .",
    "we are using a second - quantized notation of the creation and annihilation operators in the fock space , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , whose action is to create and remove , respectively , an electron at ion site @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "these operators obey the anti - commutation relations @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the operator product @xmath10 counts how many electrons ( 0 or 1 ) of spin @xmath11 are at site @xmath12 .",
    "the operator product @xmath13 displaces an electron of spin @xmath11 from site @xmath12 to one of spin @xmath14 at site @xmath15 . in this way",
    ", we can see that parameter @xmath16 in the model reflects the zeeman energy splitting in the external magnetic field ; @xmath17 is an energy scale related to the strength of spin - dependent quantum tunneling between two nearest ions ; and @xmath18 is related to the strength of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "when the number of electrons is @xmath19 , the system may represent a ferromagnetic insulator with spin - orbit coupling . for simplicity , we shall take all the parameters to be real and @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be positive numbers .",
    "note that this model has the following property : upon flipping the spin @xmath20 and @xmath21 , one finds @xmath22 .",
    "denoting the operation with the unitary map @xmath23 , we can express this as @xmath24 .",
    "this means that if we flip the spins in any energy eigenstate @xmath25 with energy @xmath26 , @xmath27 , we obtain an eigenstate with energy @xmath28 , since @xmath29 therefore the spectrum of @xmath30 is symmetric around zero , i.e. @xmath31 .",
    "this quantum wire is a prototypical system that displays different quantum phases upon changes in the parameters of the hamiltonian that are distinguished by their topological properties .",
    "this can be seen more easily if we rotate the spin basis to a direction orthogonal to the magnetic field . in the new basis ,",
    "the annihilation operators are @xmath32 after some straightforward algebra , we obtain the hamiltonian in the new basis as @xmath33 + \\text{h.c.}.\\ ] ] now we can easily see that when the parameters are at the `` sweet spot '' @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath36 therefore , the two operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( and their hermitian conjugates ) do not appear in the hamiltonian and @xmath39=[\\hat h,\\hat b_{\\downarrow n}]=0 $ ] .",
    "this means that the bound states created by @xmath38 and @xmath37 at the two ends of the wire are degenerate eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( with zero energy ) .",
    "one can show that even away from the sweet spots , there are two bound eigenstates of the hamiltonian as long as @xmath40 .",
    "the energy of these bound states is exponentially small in the system size , @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 is the lattice spacing between nearest - neighbor ions and @xmath43 is a length scale that depends on system parameters . in the `` thermodynamic limit '' @xmath44 we recover two asymptotically exact zero - energy bound states .",
    "the existence or absence of these bound states marks the topological or trivial phases of the system .",
    "the existence of these phases is illustrated in fig  [ fig : phase ] , which shows the single - particle energy spectrum of the lattice hamiltonian as @xmath16 is varied .     and",
    "@xmath45 . in the topological insulator phase , @xmath46 ,",
    "a pair of zero - energy bound states are found localized at the two edges of the lattice .",
    "they spilt away in the normal insulator phase.,width=336 ]    instead of studying the phases on the lattice , we focus on the thermodynamic limit in the following and derive a continuum hamiltonian .",
    "this approach has the advantage of simplifying the solutions since it is often easier to solve continuous differential equations rather than discrete difference equations .",
    "also , many different lattice models can have the same continuum description in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , by keeping only the relevant long - distance , universal features of the system in the continuum limit , we will gain a more general perspective on the potential phases of the system .",
    "[ sec : cl ] we shall take the continuum limit of the lattice model as the lattice constant @xmath47 while the length @xmath48 is fixed ( possibly infinite ) .",
    "this would leave us the choice of the geometry of the wire with finite , semi - infinite , or infinite lengths . in this limit",
    ", the discrete site index @xmath12 is turned into a continuous position @xmath49 .",
    "a simple way to deduce the relation between fermion operators @xmath50 in the lattice and the field operator @xmath51 in the continuum is to demand the proper anti - commutation relations    [ eq : commcl ] @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the dirac delta function .",
    "thus , the fermion field @xmath54 must have the dimension of ( length)@xmath55 . defining @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , we see that the proper definition of continuum operators has the form @xmath59 . in the limit @xmath60",
    "we may expand @xmath61 .",
    "also in this limit @xmath62 . replacing these limits in the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hlatt ] ) , we find several terms that , to first order in @xmath42 , vanish upon integration .",

    ", we find the continuum hamiltonian @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "note that in this limit we keep @xmath68 finite .",
    "using the pauli matrices @xmath69 , @xmath70 , the matrix @xmath71 could be written in a compact form as @xmath72 the spin - flip operation of the lattice hamiltonian , @xmath73 of section [ sec : qw ] , is now implemented by the pauli matrix matrix @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "in fact , there is a second continuum operator that one can define as @xmath76 .    by expanding the field operators @xmath77 in the limit @xmath60 ,",
    "show that the continuum hamiltonian for @xmath78 is @xmath79\\hat\\phi(x ) dx$ ] .",
    "thus , as the analysis in the following sections shows , the continuum limit in terms of @xmath80 becomes important for the topological phases of the system when @xmath81 changes sign . for simplicity",

    "the full spectrum of the continuum hamiltonian can be obtained by solving the first - quantized eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq:1sth ] ) .",
    "we will study the properties of @xmath71 in the rest of this paper .",
    "the careful reader may have noticed that the energy @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1sth ] ) can be unboundedly large .",
    "for instance , consider a solution such as @xmath88 with eigenvalue @xmath89 .",
    "clearly , the energy @xmath26 can be an indefinitely large number for large @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath71 and the continuum hamiltonian @xmath91 are unbounded operators .",
    "more surprisingly , even though the hamiltonian is formally hermitian , in a finite geometry ( @xmath92 and/or @xmath93 ) the energy eigenvalues can be imaginary numbers .",
    "we can see this easily by replacing @xmath90 with @xmath94 in the above solution .",
    "such a solution would be acceptable since @xmath95 need not diverge in a finite geometry for a proper choice of @xmath96 . when @xmath97 , the energy is a purely imaginary number .",
    "the presence of imaginary eigenvalues signals the loss of self - adjointness for an operator . to restore self - adjointness ,",
    "the hamiltonian needs to be properly defined on a subset of the hilbert space such that no imaginary eigenvalues exist in the spectrum . in the following two sections we will introduce the mathematical technique to deal with this problem for a general unbounded operator , and find the appropriate subset which resolves this issue for our continuum hamiltonian .",
    "the state of a quantum system is specified by a vector @xmath98 in a hilbert space @xmath99 .",
    "the hilbert space is equipped with an inner product that is a complex - valued , positive - definite , sesquilinear function on @xmath100 that maps any two states @xmath98 , @xmath101 to a complex number @xmath102 .",
    "the inner product defines a norm for the hilbert space , @xmath103 .",
    "for example , given an interval @xmath104\\subset\\mathbb{r}$ ] , the hilbert space @xmath105 $ ] is the set of all square - integrable functions with the inner - product @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath107 .    physical observables of a quantum system are specified by linear self - adjoint operators .",
    "for an operator @xmath108 to be self - adjoint , it primarily must be hermitian ( or symmetric ) , @xmath109 in many textbooks on quantum mechanics , no distinction is made between hermitian and self - adjoint operators .",
    "indeed , one need not make such a distinction for bounded operators @xmath110 , for which there exists @xmath111 for all @xmath112 such that @xmath113 .",
    "however , the distinction between hermitian and self - adjoint operators becomes crucial for unbounded operators .",
    "this is so because for unbounded operators the designation of the domain of the operator @xmath108 , @xmath114 , generally becomes an important part of its definition .    for hermitian operators ,",
    "the connection between unboundedness and a restricted domain is quite general .",
    "in fact , according to the hellinger - toeplitz theorem ,  @xcite a hermitian operator @xmath115 with the domain @xmath116 is bounded .",
    "it is a direct corollary of this theorem that an unbounded and hermitian operator can not be defined on the whole hilbert space .",
    "let us illustrate this point by an example .",
    "consider the position operator , @xmath117 , on the hilbert space @xmath118 $ ] defined as @xmath119 for @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "( [ eq : herm ] ) is satisfied since @xmath121 thus , the position operator is a hermitian operator . in this case",
    ", @xmath117 is a bounded operator since for any @xmath122 $ ] , @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "now , if we consider the whole real line , @xmath125 , the position operator defined on the hilbert space @xmath126 is hermitian , but no longer bounded . to see this , consider @xmath127 such that @xmath128 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath129 is not square - integrable and therefore @xmath117 is unbounded .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath117 can not be defined on the whole hilbert space and one must find an appropriate domain for @xmath117 , such as @xmath130 .",
    "this means @xmath131 for @xmath132 faster than @xmath133 . as we shall discuss in detail below , restrictions on the domain of an operator",
    "are commonly expressed in terms of boundary conditions on the state vectors .    in order to define a self - adjoint operator properly ,",
    "we first need to define the adjoint of an operator and its domain . for an operator @xmath134 and @xmath135 ,",
    "the adjoint @xmath136 is defined for @xmath137 by @xmath138 ( this defines @xmath139 uniquely only if the operator @xmath108 is `` densely defined ; '' see the appendix  [ app : dense ] for a discussion . ) a self - adjoint operator @xmath108 is hermitian _ and _ has the same domain as its adjoint , @xmath140 .    as an example , consider the momentum operator , @xmath141 , on the hilbert space @xmath118 $ ] defined as @xmath142 ( we use units such that planck s constant @xmath143 ) . since the derivative of a square - integrable function can become arbitrarily large , @xmath141 is unbounded . for its domain",

    "that is , @xmath148 : \\psi(x ) \\text { is absolutely continuous } \\ } \\supset \\mathscr{d}(p)$ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 is not self - adjoint .",
    "some puzzling consequences of the lack of self - adjointness for @xmath141 are discussed in ref .  .",
    "an important consequence for our purposes is that the domain of the adjoint operator is so unconstraint that @xmath149 admits _ imaginary _ eigenvalues .",
    "that is , one may find states @xmath150 such that @xmath151 for @xmath152 .",
    "indeed , one can easily show that the two states @xmath153 are such eigenstates with equal norm , @xmath154 .",
    "@xcite    as seen in this example , the domain of the hermitian operator , @xmath108 , is no larger than the domain of its adjoint , @xmath136 .",
    "this means that in order to make the operator , @xmath108 , self - adjoint one must _ extend _ its domain in a way that shrinks the domain of the adjoint to match it , and eliminate the imaginary eigenvalues from the spectrum of the adjoint operator .",
    "if the procedure is successful , we find a self - adjoint extension of the hermitian operator , @xmath108 .",
    "this was made systematic by von neumann by a method known as the deficiency indices .    in this method ,",
    "given a hermitian , densely defined , and closed operator @xmath134 ( see appendix  [ app : dense ] for the definitions ) , one first finds the adjoint operator @xmath136 and its domain @xmath155 and then solves for the imaginary eigenstates of the adjoint operator .",
    "these solutions define the two _ deficiency _ subspaces @xmath156 .",

    "so , sometimes the choice @xmath168 is made .",

    "we will introduce a more intuitive way to find the proper domain of self - adjoint extensions in terms of boundary conditions and the local current associated with the corresponding self - adjoint operator .",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) , in semi - infinite and finite size wire geometries . in each case , we will show that the appropriately extended domains admit additional bound states in the topological phase and relate their properties to the boundary conditions at the ends of the wire .",

    "different lattice models can share the same continuum , or field - theory , description and , therefore , the same universal behavior . in the context of topological phases , it is instructive to compare our results to those for the kitaev model for a one - dimensional @xmath301-wave superconductor .",
    "@xcite this is a model proposed for the realization of exotic topological bound states , known as majorana fermions , with special non - abelian fractional statistics potentially useful for quantum computation .",

    "@xcite while the physics of this system is quite different from the one we studied in this paper ( e.g. , there is no superconductivity in our system ) , the continuum limits of the two systems are equivalent .",
    "this means they have the same topological phase diagram .",
    "in particular , the self - adjoint extensions in the continuum and the topological bound states are in one - to - one correspondence to each other . what differs from one continuum model to the other is the specific structure of the quantum fields and , most importantly , the physical properties of the different phases .",
    "so , our analysis here is directly applicable to the study of topological phases of the kitaev model .",
    "topological bound states , such as majorana fermions , are interesting in part for their usefulness in device applications .",
    "these applications are often based on dynamical features of the bound states as they are moved around or otherwise manipulated . in such manipulations ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is changed in time by varying the external parameters of the system .",
    "for example , by changing the zeeman energy @xmath16 one can manipulate the position of the bound states .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that , when analyzing such schemes in the continuum , it is quite important to work with a self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian since only such an operator can define the time evolution of the system properly .    in summary , through a simple model we have illustrated the importance of self - adjoint extensions in the continuum , or field - theory , description of topological phases of quantum systems with boundaries . in particular , we clarified the physical interpretation of the extended operators in terms of a conserved local current .",
    "these extensions correspond to different physical situations with physically distinct environments outside the system , or equivalently , experimental conditions .",
    "we showed that the distinction may persist even after imposing internal symmetries that restrict the choice of the extension .",
