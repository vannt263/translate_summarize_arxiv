    "maximal surfaces possess a weierstrass - type representation formula @xcite .    the most significant difference between minimal and maximal surfaces is the fact that the only complete spacelike maximal surfaces are planes @xcite , which is probably the main reason why people have not paid much attention to maximal surfaces .",
