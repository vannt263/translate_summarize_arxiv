    "accordingly we can write down the expression for the polar ejection force , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the maximum polar ejection force .",
    "the sliding force due to the motors is proportional to the overlapping mts from the opposite centrosomes  @xcite .",

    "as shown in the figure the bipolar spindle solution is always stable .",

    "the choice of scaled dimensionless variables are , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath16 , @xmath40 .",

    "the stability diagrams in fig.3 show a variety of scenarios .",
    "it exhibits regions where there is bistability with two different stable solutions for bipolar spindle , region where both bipolar spindle and monopolar configuration ( @xmath51 ) is stable , region with just one solution for stable bipolar spindle and a region where no bipolar spindle is stable and only monopolar configuration is stable .",
    "the corresponding plots for scaled force as function of centrosome separation is plotted in fig.4 for these four different regions in the stability diagram .",

    "in particular fig.5 illustrates that although in the bistable regions two different spindle configurations are stable , in general one of the two corresponds to a global minima in terms of potential energy . the fact that eq .",
    "( [ eq : my - form ] ) can be derived from an effective potential , @xmath56 is crucial since the functional form of @xmath56 provides insight not only about the stability of the stationary states but also provides the clue about the dependence on the initial configuration of the system and the long term evolution of the system in presence of noise .",
    "it also rationalizes many of the observations of the numerical studies in ref.@xcite .",
    "first of all it was seen in ref @xcite that the final configuration of the spindle ( on whether it is bipolar or monopolar ) is dependent on the initial separation distance .",
    "the potential energy landscape provides an explanation on how the final configuration would be dependent on the zones of attraction of the potential landscape with multiple minima .",
    "it was also seen in ref .",
    "@xcite that for certain situations , the initial configuration eventually relaxed to a fixed configuration after an intermediate metastable configuration .",
    "this can understood in terms of the different depths of the potential minima for the two different configurations .",
    "eventually the system would relax to the global minima in presence of noise in the system .",
    "in fact the height of the potential barrier would then determine the time scales of relaxation of the system to its final steady state configuration .    in order to quantitatively",
    "compare the results of the stability diagram obtained here with the numerical studies in ref.@xcite , we note that they had observed that for parameter values @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for @xmath61 , monopolar configuration was stable , whereas for @xmath62 , bipolar spindle configuration was stable . in order to compare , first we estimate the typical value of @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 . with this specific choice of @xmath65",
    ", we find that bipolar spindle configuration is unstable , while monopolar configuration is stable for @xmath66 only for @xmath67 ( fig.3b ) , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite even for @xmath68 bipolar spindle was observed to be unstable .",
    "we however find that for lower values of b i.e ; @xmath69 , bipolar spindle is unstable like in ref.@xcite .",
    "the quantitative discrepancy between the analytical prediction of this model and the simulation results reported in ref.@xcite can partially be attributed to our rather crude estimation of the radius of the disc @xmath30 .",
    "an higher value of @xmath30 would in general result in lower value of @xmath53 for which stability of bipolar spindle configuration is lost . in general , the parameter range of @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath53 along with @xmath3 and @xmath29 can be varied over a certain range by altering the physiological conditions within the cell and analogously the scaled variables would span a range of values including @xmath30 .",
    "finally we study the case in which @xmath29 chromosomes are uniformly distributed on a ring of radius @xmath70 .",

    "6(b ) we choose a value of @xmath84 , obtained by estimating @xmath85 and @xmath86 as done in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find that for this ring geometry , even for very low value of @xmath53 , the bipolar spindle becomes unstable as was observed in ref.@xcite . as in the previous case , by integrating the expression of dimensionless scaled force in eq .",
    "[ eq : scaledforce2 ] , it possible to associate an effective potential energy function @xmath87 , as a function of centrosome separation distance in the scaled variable @xmath88 .",
    "this expression reads @xmath89",
    "in summary , we have studied and analyzed the mechanical stability of mitotic spindle structure within the framework of a minimal model proposed in ref . @xcite which incorporates the interactions between chromosomes with mts nucleated from the centrosome , the sliding forces generated by motor proteins on overlapping mt filaments , and the interactions of the mts with kinetochore machinery within the cell .",
    "having assumed that the chromosomes are _ a priori _ distributed homogeneously on a disc or a ring in the mid - plane between the two centrosomes , we obtain a closed form analytic expression for the forces acting between pair of centrosomes .",
    "the assumption of such an arrangement of chromosomes is consistent with earlier numerical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "we analyze the stability of the spindle configurations and obtain the corresponding stability diagram by invoking the condition of _ stable _ mechanical equilibrium apart from the balance of forces .",
    "this stability diagram is expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters which are essentially ratios of the strength of the different interaction forces .",
    "this stability diagram allows us to quantify the impact of the different interactions at play in determining the final configuration of the spindle .",
    "we find that in general both for the case of chromosomes arranged on a ring and disc , if there is a net outward sliding forces by motors @xmath52 then bipolar spindle is stable , whereas for sufficiently high inward sliding forces of motor @xmath90 , monopolar configuration is stable .",
    "we also found that for sufficiently high value of @xmath53 , even for outward motor sliding force @xmath91 , the bipolar spindle configuration can be unstable .",
    "interestingly , when @xmath92 , below a threshold value of @xmath53 corresponding to kinetochore - mt interaction forces , there are regimes of bistability characterized by coexistence of two different spindle length , and also stability of the bipolar spindle configuration and monopolar configuration . the origin of this bistable behavior can be associated with multiple minima in the effective potential energy function that can be derived from the expression of total interaction force .",
    "in fact it also allows us to rationalize the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was seen that the final stable configuration was seen to be dependent on the initial separation distance .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the prolonged lifetime in the bipolar spindle configuration to the eventual _ monopolar _ state observed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be attributed to transition from shallow potential minima corresponding to spindle configuration to deeper potential energy minima associated with the monopolar configuration .",
