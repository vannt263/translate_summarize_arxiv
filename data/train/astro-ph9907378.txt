    "note that the extreme steepness of the spectrum ( the nucleus is @xmath23 times fainter in v than in k ) has an important impact on the accuracy of the nuclear broad band photometry . the standard procedure used to flux ",
    "calibrate hst images involves multiplying the count rate by the photflam keyword ( the conversion factor to flux units in erg s@xmath6 @xmath24 @xmath6 ) .",

    "therefore , the flux scale must be re - computed for each filter by convolving the filter transmission curve with the source spectrum .",
    "we adopted an iterative procedure : using the photflam keywords we obtained zero order flux estimates , fitted a reddened power law , and re  computed the photflam keywords , repeating the process until it converged .",
    "the decrease of the photflam keyword was less than 1% in f222 m and f190n , but @xmath27 in f160w , and 40% and 55% for f814w and f555w respectively ( see table [ tab : spnuc ] ) . in conclusion , it is essential to convolve the steep nucleus input spectrum with the instrumental responses . the resulting spectrum derived from our corrected hst photometry is presented in fig . [ fig : spnuc ] ( left panel ) and is discussed in sec .

    "[ fig : nucleus ] ) that the dust lane , interpreted as a warped disk of gas and dust crossing the nuclear region , produces significant foreground obscuration . to study the sed of the nucleus , it is crucial to disentangle the foreground ( disk ) component from the intrinsic local absorption near the agn .",
    "the extinction due to the dust lane also prevents a direct determination of the radial light profile near the nucleus of the galaxy in the wavelength bands observed .",
    "we can derive an average light profile only by combining the available information in the f555w , f160w and f222 m bands after estimating the respective reddening corrections .",
    "this is of course possible only assuming that no significant colour gradients are present .",
    "we briefly present a simple , zero - order estimate to correct for reddening which , hypothesizing foreground screen extinction , is derived from the color in two bands at @xmath38 and @xmath39 as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the intrinsic and reddened magnitudes at the effective wavelength @xmath38 , @xmath43 is the extinction curve , i.e. @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",

    ", we construct an e(b - v ) map for the nuclear region by combining the f160w ( h ) and f222 m ( k ) nicmos images .",
    "these are more suitable for the reddening determination than the v and i band fluxes , which drop to undetectable levels in many of the heavily reddened regions of the dust lane . we assume an intrinsic colour @xmath54 which is an average value for both spiral bulges and elliptical galaxies with a standard deviation of only 0.1 magnitudes ( e.g. hunt et al . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that the color correction due to the non - standard nicmos filters is negligible ( 0.2 in jonhson s system corresponds to 0.24 in nicmos ) .    to qualitatively verify the accuracy of the correction procedure ,",

    "the corrected f814w image is seen to be mostly smooth , similar to the f222 m image which is obviously little affected by reddening .",

    "<S> we report new hst _ wfpc2 _ and _ nicmos _ observations of the center of the nearest radio galaxy centaurus a ( ngc 5128 ) and discuss their implications for our understanding of the active nucleus and jet . </S>",

    "<S> the optical and part of the near - ir emission can be explained by the extrapolation of the x - ray power law reddened by @xmath0 , a value consistent with other independent estimates .    the 20pc - scale nuclear disk discovered by schreier et al . ( @xcite ) </S>",

    "<S> nicmos 3 pa@xmath2 observations in a 50@xmath350  circumnuclear region suggest enhanced star formation ( @xmath4m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 ) at the edges of the putative bar seen with iso , perhaps due to shocks driven into the gas .    </S>",
    "<S> the light profile , reconstructed from v , h and k observations , shows that centaurus a has a core profile with a resolved break at @xmath7 and suggests a black  hole mass of @xmath8m@xmath5 . a linear blue structure aligned with the radio / x  </S>",
