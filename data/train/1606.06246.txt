    "one of the most commonly - encountered issues with big data is heterogeneity . when collecting vast quantities of data , it is usually unrealistic to expect that stylised , traditional statistical models of independent and identically distributed observations can adequately capture the complexity of the underlying data generating mechanism .",
    "departures from such models may take many forms , including missing data , correlated errors and data combined from multiple sources , to mention just a few .",
    "when data are collected over time , heterogeneity often manifests itself through non - stationarity , where the data generating mechanism varies with time .",
    "perhaps the simplest form of non - stationarity assumes that population changes occur at a relatively small number of discrete time points .",
    "if correctly estimated , these ` changepoints ' can be used to partition the original data set into shorter segments , which can then be analysed using methods designed for stationary time series . moreover , the locations of these changepoints are often themselves of significant practical interest .    in this paper ,",
    "we study high - dimensional time series that may have changepoints ; moreover , we consider in particular settings where at a changepoint , the mean structure changes in a sparse subset of the coordinates . despite their simplicity , such models are of great interest in a wide variety of applications .",
    "for instance , in the case of stock price data , it may well be the case that stocks in related industry sectors experience virtually simultaneous ` shocks ' @xcite . in internet security monitoring ,",
    "a sudden change in traffic at multiple routers may be an indication of a distributed denial of service attack @xcite .",
    "in functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) studies , a rapid change in blood oxygen level dependent ( bold ) contrast in a subset of voxels may suggest neurological activity of interest @xcite .    our main contribution is to propose a new method for estimating the number and locations of the changepoints in such high - dimensional time series , a challenging task in the absence of knowledge of the coordinates that undergo a change . in brief , we first seek a good projection direction , which should ideally be closely aligned with the vector of mean changes .",
    "we can then apply an existing univariate changepoint estimation algorithm to the projected series . for this reason",
    ", we call our algorithm ` inspect ` , short for formative parse rojection for stimation of hangepoins ; it is implemented in the * r * package * inspectchangepoint * @xcite .    in more detail , in the single changepoint case ,",
    "our first observation is that at the population level , the vector of mean changes is the leading left singular vector of the matrix obtained as the cumulative sum ( cusum ) transformation of the mean matrix of the time series .",
    "this motivates us to begin by applying the cusum transformation to the time series .",
    "unfortunately , computing the @xmath0-sparse leading left singular vector of a matrix is a combinatorial optimisation problem , but nevertheless , we are able to formulate an appropriate convex relaxation of the problem , from which we derive our projection direction . at the second stage of our algorithm , we compute the vector of cusum statistics for the projected series , identifying a changepoint if the maximum absolute value of this vector is sufficiently large . for the case of multiple changepoints",
    ", we combine our single changepoint algorithm with the method of wild binary segmentation @xcite to identify changepoints recursively .",
    "a brief illustration of the ` inspect ` algorithm in action is given in figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "here , we simulated a @xmath1 data matrix having independent normal columns with identity covariance and with three changepoints in the mean structure at locations @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "changes occur in 40 coordinates , where consecutive changepoints overlap in half of their coordinates , and the squared @xmath4 norms of the vectors of mean changes were @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the top - left panel shows the original data matrix and the top - right shows its cusum transformation , while the bottom - left panel shows overlays for the three detected changepoints of the univariate cusum statistics after projection .",
    "finally , the bottom - right panel displays the largest absolute values of the projected cusum statistics obtained by running the wild binary segmentation algorithm to completion ( in practice , we would apply a termination criterion instead , but this is still helpful for illustrative purposes ) .",
    "we see that the three detected changepoints are very close to their true locations , and it is only for these three locations that we obtain a sufficiently large cusum statistic to declare a changepoint .",
    "we emphasise that our focus here is on the so - called _ offline _ version of the changepoint estimation problem , where we observe the whole data set before seeking to locate changepoints .",
    "the corresponding online problem , where one aims to declare a changepoint as soon as possible after it has occurred , is also of great interest @xcite , but is beyond the scope of the current work .",
