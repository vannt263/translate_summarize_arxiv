    "the eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbv ) sometimes mimic the spectroscopic properties of type  iin core collapse supernovae ( sne ) and approach their luminosities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the type  iin ( narrow @xmath5  km / s line widths ) spectral type ( @xcite , @xcite ) seems to be a property of almost any stellar eruption , explosion or evolutionary process with a strong interaction between the ejected material and the circumstellar medium , ranging from proto - planetary nebulae to some of the most luminous sne ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite introduced the label of `` supernova impostors '' for lbv transients with type  iin spectra that approach the luminosity of type  ii sn but are believed to be somewhat fainter than the lowest luminosity sne ( @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 ) .",
    "the `` prototypical '' luminous lbv transient is the eruption of @xmath2 carinae in the mid-1800s ( see the reviews by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we should note , however , that a typical sn impostor like sn  1997bs ( see @xcite ) has completely different velocities , ejected masses and durations from the typical galactic analogue even if many of these differences can be explained as a selection effect ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the need for clearer distinctions between genuine sne and stellar eruptions is illustrated by the ongoing debate over the nature of sn  2008s and the transient later that year in ngc  300 .",
    "the dust enshrouded progenitors ( @xcite , @xcite ) are astonishingly rare , only a few per galaxy , and appear to be extreme agb stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) with graphitic dust ( @xcite , @xcite ) rather than the silicate dust typically seen in massive stars . a broad range of physical mechanisms have been proposed for these events : an extension of the lbv phenomenon ( @xcite , @xcite ) , some other type of massive star transient ( @xcite , @xcite ) , electron capture sn or some other form of low luminosity sn ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , a binary merger ( @xcite ) , or a mass ejection associated with forming a white dwarf ( @xcite ) . at this point , several years after the optical peaks , both events are still bright mid - ir sources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) that are well - explained by an explosive transient ( @xcite ) .",
    "a further consideration is that there appears to be a mismatch between massive star formation rates and supernova rates that could be solved if significant numbers of these fainter transients were sn rather than impostors ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the alternatives are either that massive star formation rate estimates are significantly in error ( by a factor of two ) or that the failed sn rate is comparable to the normal sn rate ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the obvious difference between eruptions and supernovae is that stars survive eruptions but not core collapse .",
    "candidate surviving stars have been found for sn  1954j ( @xcite , @xcite ) , sn  1961v ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , sn  1997bs ( @xcite , @xcite ) , sn  2000ch ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and sn  2002kg / v37 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . with the exceptions of sn  2000ch and sn  2002kg / v37 , which have varied repeatedly ,",
    "it is probably safe to say that none of these identifications are absolutely certain and that some are likely wrong . even with near perfect astrometry one can still be fooled by binary companions ( see @xcite ) or chance projections .",
    "it would be best to have some additional tests .",
    "the standard picture of the impostors is that the visual transient is associated with the radiatively driven ejection of a significant amount of mass ( see @xcite ) , although @xcite discuss shock driven models in some detail .",
    "the high density of the ejected material leads to dust formation , and the expanding shell of material then obscures the surviving star for an extended period . in @xcite",
    "we examined the formation of dust in the transients of hot stars , and found that dust formation and ( great ) eruptions should be essentially synonymous , as the conditions seen in eruptions are also necessary and sufficient conditions for forming dust in the ejecta .",
    "the most frequently proposed test of this picture is to search for the mid - ir emission produced by reprocessing the emissions of the surviving star in the dusty ejecta . for the spectacular galactic example of @xmath2 carinae , @xmath8 of the emission",
    "is absorbed and reradiated in the mid - ir , leading to a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that peaks near @xmath9 m ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , most of the candidate survivors are usually optically fainter than their progenitors , and this is generally explained as being due to absorption in the ejecta",
    ". however , there have been attempts to find the predicted mid - ir emission only for sn  1954j ( @xcite ) and sn  1961v",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) , although @xcite show some results from a broader survey . finding the dust emission then allows us to characterize the luminosity of the star and the mass of the ejecta .",
    "this test also largely eliminates false detections of non - binary survivors due to chance superpositions because of the small angular extent of the shell and the relative rarity of other luminous dusty stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a second test , namely that the surviving star should tend to become systematically brighter in the optical . as the shell expands , its optical depth drops , and",
    "the survivor should reappear .",
    "this steady brightening is observed for @xmath2 carinae ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rate of brightening further constrains the optical depth of the ejected material .",
    "neither the mid - ir emission nor the optical brightening eliminates the possibility that the `` surviving '' star is really a binary companion to the progenitor ( see @xcite ) , but superposed on the steady trend , there should also be the general low level variability of lbvs , which should help to eliminate this possibility .",
    "@xcite use the absence of any lbv - like variability of the candidate surviving stars for sn  1961v as one of their arguments in favor of a sn rather than an lbv explanation for this transient .    here",
    "we carry out these tests , as possible , for sn  1954j / v12 , sn  1997bs , sn  1999bw , sn  2000ch , sn  2001ac , sn  2002bu , sn  2002kg / v37 and sn  2003gm .",
    "we also , for comparison , examine the properties of @xmath2 carinae .",
    "we do not consider sn  2008s or the 2008 ngc  300-ot because their evolution can not be described by the `` standard '' lbv eruption picture  they require explosive transients and dust re - forming in a pre - existing wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "while we still view sn  1961v as a supernova ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we include a short discussion in response to the rebuttal case by @xcite .",
    "we do not consider many of the candidate impostors in @xcite because they are either too distant ( e.g. sn  2006bv ) or lack ( adequate ) mid - ir observations ( e.g. sn  2009ip ) .",
    "table  [ tab : objects ] summarizes the distances and galactic extinctions we use for each source , the transient properties from @xcite , and the elapsed time since the transient of the primary data we examine .",
    "the radiated energy of the transient is estimated as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the luminosity corresponding to the peak absolute magnitude and @xmath12 is the time scale for the transient to fade by @xmath13  mag .",
    "we have included sn  1961v , sn  2008s and the ngc  300-ot for comparison even though we will not model their properties in detail because we have done so elsewhere ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we start in  [ sec : motivation ] with an overview of the evolution of dusty shells .",
    "we first outline the requirements for dust formation and then make several estimates of expected ejecta mass for either radiatively - driven or explosive transients .",
    "then we describe the optical depth and mid - ir evolution of expanding dusty shells . in  [ sec : data ] , we summarize the available data and how it will be analyzed . in  [ sec : objects ] , we discuss each source individually in terms of how well its properties can be explained by an expanding dusty shell . finally , in  [",
    "sec : discussion ] we summarize the results and outline the need for future observations .",
    "the scenario we consider consists of a massive luminous star that for a brief period of time ( months to decades ) undergoes a period of dramatically higher mass loss .",
    "our general focus is not the initial transient but its possible mechanisms , the long term evolution of the ejected material and its observational consequences . in  [ sec : form ] we outline the conditions for forming dust , and then in  [ sec : mloss ] we set limits on the mass loss rates .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ sec : opdepth ] we consider the optical depth of the dust , the resulting optical depths , their evolution and the observational consequences . in ",
    "[ sec : dusty ] we describe the dusty dust radiation transfer models we use for detailed models of seds .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : caveats ] we discuss the effects of more complicated geometries and inhomogeneity .",
    "the general assumption about the impostor transients is that they are cool ( @xmath14  k ) , luminous ( @xmath15 ) eruptions from otherwise massive ( @xmath1 ) , hot ( @xmath16  k ) , luminous ( @xmath17 ) stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "we explored the physics of dust formation around hot stars , finding that a necessary condition for dust formation was that the ejecta wind becomes non - dust optically thick and establishes a cool , external `` pseudo - photosphere '' with @xmath14  k. hotter transients produce so many soft uv ( @xmath18  ev ) photons that small dust grains photo - evaporate faster than they can grow .",
    "such temperatures are typical of all these eruptions , and indeed of real sne as well , and are largely a consequence of the rapid rise in non - dust opacities with temperature in this regime ( @xcite ) . as we discuss below , such dense winds must also be optically thick in order to be radiatively accelerated .",
    "we can view the ejecta as a time varying wind surrounding the star characterized by mass loss rate @xmath19 , wind velocity @xmath20 , and the mass fraction of condensible species @xmath21 .",
    "not all the condensible mass need condense onto grains , so the ultimate mass fraction of dust @xmath22 .",
    "the wind is produced by a star / transient of luminosity @xmath23 , photospheric radius @xmath24 and effective temperature @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "in @xcite we found that the requirement for dust formation is roughly @xmath27/year .",
    "this limit is relatively insensitive to other parameters because it is associated with the `` exponential '' drop in the production of photons towards short wavelengths .",
    "once the wind conditions are such that the dust formation region is shielded from the hot stellar photosphere , dust formation can commence once the equilibrium temperature of small grains is low enough ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this sets the formation radius at @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dust destruction temperature , @xmath30 is the planck - averaged absorption efficiency for the smallest grains , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the transient luminosity and temperature . for small grains , @xmath33 is independent of @xmath34 because @xmath35 , and a reasonable approximation for both the graphitic and silicate dust models of @xcite is that @xmath36 under the assumption that the transient temperature is @xmath37  k ( see @xcite ) .",
    "including the planck factors makes the formation radius roughly three times larger than if they are ignored .",
    "the growth rate of the dust is proportional to the density , so dust growth is essentially complete by the time @xmath38 because of the rapidly dropping density of the expanding ejecta .",
    "thus , the time scale on which the dust begins to form is @xmath39 for expansion velocity @xmath20 . in most cases ,",
    "this is longer than the duration of the optical transient peak ( see table  [ tab : objects ] ) , suggesting that dust formation is limited by the fainter post - peak luminosity rather than the luminosity at peak and that the initial decline in the luminosity is usually not due to dust formation .",
    "dust will not form if the transient temperature rises significantly above @xmath40  k because the increasing numbers of soft uv photons photo - evaporate grains before they can grow ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while the objects we consider generally lack the detailed light curves needed to probe this phase , the signature of dust formation should be an abrupt dimming in the optical combined with a sudden rise in the near / mid - ir due to the initially high dust temperatures ( @xmath41  k ) .",
    "the opacity of the grains depends somewhat on the maximum size to which they grow , @xmath42 , ( see @xcite ) and @xmath43 depends on the density of the wind ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the dust opacity at any wavelength depends on the grain composition and growth history , but not by enormous factors given plausible distributions .",
    "hence , for our present study we all simply adopt the standard opacities used by dusty ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we provide the detailed parameters below in ",
    "[ sec : dusty ] and scale our analytic results to an opacity of @xmath44  @xmath45/g .",
    "many uncertainties in the opacities can also simply be absorbed into the uncertainties in the dust mass fraction @xmath46 .",
    "the total mass of the ejecta plays a key role for any expectation about the subsequent evolution .",
    "the peak mass loss rate inferred for the great eruption of @xmath2 carinae is roughly @xmath47/year for a period of order @xmath48  years , leading to a total ejecta mass of @xmath49 ( @xcite ) .",
    "other shells observed around hot stars in the galaxy are inferred to have masses from @xmath50 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , we have little knowledge of their mass loss rates .",
    "typical estimates assume that some estimate of the radial spread in the dusty ejecta can be used to estimate the lifetime of the transient , and the generic estimates are @xmath51  years and thus @xmath52/year . as we argue in @xcite , this argument for the lifetimes",
    "is almost certainly wrong based on both the data ( it would mis - predict the statistical properties of the shell geometries and the rate of observable transients ) and our theoretical models ( no dust would form at such low mass loss rates ) .",
    "rather , the radial spread must be dominated by the spread in ejecta velocities and the true ages are much shorter and the mass loss rates much higher . the lower bound based on the need to form dust is @xmath53 ( @xcite ) .",
    "very crudely , this suggests bounds of @xmath50 and @xmath54 for mechanisms having anything in common with the galactic systems .",
    "if the ejection is radiatively driven , the radiation has to provide the energy and momentum needed to generate the outflow , with negligible contributions from the initial thermal energy of the material .",
    "the momentum imparted to the ejecta satisfies @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the asymptotic velocity and the optical depth @xmath57 determines the number of times a photon is scattered before escaping ( see the reviews of hot stellar winds by @xcite or @xcite ) . for the high mass loss rates of interest , the wind has to be optically thick , with @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the escape velocity from the stellar surface set by the quiescent luminosity @xmath23 and temperature @xmath25 .",
    "for a line - driven wind , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the ( continuum opacity - dependent ) eddington luminosity ( again , see @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the optical depth requirement for accelerating the wind ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : accel ] ) generally results in the formation of a `` pseudo - photosphere '' in the wind ( i.e. @xmath62 ) that will shield the dust formation region from soft ultraviolet radiation and allow the formation of dust ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also an upper bound on the mass loss rate set by using all available energy to lift material out of the potential well of the star .",
    "this is referred to as the `` photon tiring limit '' by @xcite .",
    "given an observed transient luminosity @xmath63 and temperature @xmath64 , the upper limit on the mass loss is @xmath65 here we have modeled the losses due to accelerating the wind as a redshifting of the transient spectrum , as might be appropriate for a continuum opacity . the true transient luminosity is @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the unobserved temperature of the transient at the stellar surface .",
    "the radiative efficiency of this process is of order @xmath68 and @xmath69 unless the transient is in the extreme limit where most of the underlying luminosity is absorbed into expelling the ejecta ( @xmath70 with @xmath71 ) .",
    "the `` tiring limit '' on the mass loss rate ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mdotmax ] ) combined with the ( somewhat arbitrary ) event duration @xmath12 from table  [ tab : objects ] leads to a first rough estimate @xmath72 of the ejected mass .",
    "as reported in table  [ tab : objects2 ] , most of the sources can have ejected only @xmath73-@xmath74 of material even at the `` tiring limit , '' albeit with significant uncertainties from the sensitivity of the mass loss rate to the stellar escape velocity ( @xmath75 ) . only sn  1961v , due to its high peak luminosity , and @xmath2  carinae , due to its long transient duration , can have ejected more than @xmath76 as radiatively driven transients .    in an explosion ,",
    "the ejecta are shock heated and accelerated to temperatures and velocities exceeding the escape velocity and then expand .",
    "the observed luminosity is a balance between the diffusion of radiation out of the ejecta and losses due to the expansion .",
    "if the expansion time scale is @xmath77 and the diffusion time scale for electron scattering is @xmath78 , then the transient duration is approximately the geometric mean @xmath79 if the expansion time is shorter than the diffusion time ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if we identify @xmath80 with the event time scale @xmath12 , then we obtain an estimate of the ejected mass @xmath81 table  [ tab : objects2 ] reports @xmath82 for each source .",
    "these mass estimates tend to be slightly smaller than the estimated upper limits @xmath83 for radiatively driven transients except when the transient durations are long .",
    "sn  1961v and @xmath2  carinae again stand out as having the largest mass loss estimates .",
    "the radiative efficiency of an explosive transient is roughly determined by @xmath84 which means that explosive transients are generally radiatively inefficient because they lose energy due to expansion faster than it can be diffusively radiated .",
    "this suggests that uncertainties about the mechanism can be described by the radiative efficiency @xmath85 , where the ejected mass is @xmath86 radiatively driven transients tend to have @xmath87 and explosive transients tend to have @xmath88 , while radiatively driven transients close to the tiring limit and weak explosions have @xmath89 .",

    "the primary consequence of asymmetry is that the spread in radius with azimuth produces a spread in the dust temperature that is likely far greater than the spread introduced by the finite shell thickness . in our quantitative models we use shells with @xmath214 in large part to mimic this effect , although in many cases changes in the shell thickness have few consequences for interpreting the available data .",
    "geometry can produce differences between the apparent optical depths in absorption , as measured by the optical / uv flux , and emission , as measured by the mid - ir flux .",

    ", we should not see enormous differences between these two means of estimating the optical depth even in complex geometries .",

    "@xmath238 the shell has optical depth @xmath239 in direction @xmath240 , so the observed flux at later times is essentially @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the direction in which the optical depth is lowest ( sum over multiple minima if needed ) .",
    "the pre - factor , which is the effective area over which photons escape ( and becomes a constant in the limit that there are no significant optical depth variations over the shell ) , only makes it harder to combat the geometric evolution of the optical depth . adding an anisotropic scattering function ( @xmath243 ) or making the distribution non - axisymmetric ( @xmath244 ) does not qualitatively change anything because neither changes the temporal scaling of the exponential .",
    "thus , geometry complicates the relationship between optical depth and ejected mass , but does not fundamentally alter the temporal scaling of the optical depth .",
    "another potential problem is the effect of small scale optical depth fluctuations on the observed `` effective '' optical depth  when the optical depth is high , the observed optical flux becomes exponentially sensitive to leaks through the optically thick medium , similar to the arguments about super - eddington winds in @xcite .",
    "at least in simulations of a turbulent molecular cloud , @xcite found log - normal column density fluctuations with a variance on the order of a factor of 2 . while a model of dust radiation transfer through an expanding three dimensional medium with large spatial variations in the optical depth is beyond the scope of this paper , it is instructive to consider a simple model .",

    "there are two problems with this model arising from the fact that the optical fluxes changed little between may 2004 , one year post peak , and december 2008 , over 5 years post - peak .",
    "the first is simply that at the earlier epoch the inner edge of the ejecta would lie over 5 times closer to the star and would have over twice the temperature , but dust simply can not form / survive at temperatures of 3000 - 4000  k. this suggests that the velocities must be higher than @xmath638  km / s .",

    "the most striking result of our survey is that we find no source ( with adequate data to draw a conclusion ) that is consistent with this standard picture .",
    "the problem for the standard picture is that expanding shells of material impose a tyranny of geometry on the evolution of the system because the optical depth drops as @xmath647 .",

    "the simplest solution is to make them long lived .",
    "the optical transient is simply a sign post that the star is transitioning from a low mass loss rate to a high mass loss rate . for these typically hot stars ,",
    "a mass loss rate of order @xmath27/year leads to dust formation because the wind shields the dust formation region from the uv emissions of the generally hot stars and the high densities allow particle growth ( see @xcite ) . due to a combination of the fading of the initial transient and the formation of dust ,",
    "the star fades in the optical to be fainter than the progenitor _ but the star remains in the high mass loss state ! _",
    "the advantage of a steady wind is that it has a roughly constant optical depth once the dust starts to form , which is far more consistent with the available data .",
    "when the star leaves the high mass loss state and drops below the threshold for dust formation , the optical depth initially drops on the time scale to cross the dust formation radius and then settles onto the @xmath648 scaling of a shell .    in particular , this is the only solution we found to explain the historical visual light curve of @xmath2 carinae ",
    "@xmath2 carinae went into a high mass loss state circa 1850 and came out of it circa 1950 . as it exited the high mass loss phase",
    ", it dropped in luminosity and reverted to a hotter temperature .",
    "this is by far the simplest explanation for the long period of roughly constant visual luminosity and color .",
    "if all the dust was produced in a short lived period circa 1850 , there is no physically reasonable evolution in the stellar luminosity and temperature that can reproduce the observed light curve  the luminosity must change by an order of magnitude just to compensate for a change in optical depth of @xmath327 , while the optical depth of the ejecta should have changed by almost two orders of magnitude over that period ! the only effective counter to the effects of expansion on the optical depth is to steadily raise the opacity as the shell expands , but we have been unable to identify any realistic mechanism for doing so .",
    "it is more likely that the effective opacity is diminishing as the shell becomes less homogeneous with paths through the ejecta of lower optical depth than the mean .    for the extragalactic sources ,",
    "the existing data suggest this solution for sn  1997bs , sn  1954j and sn  2003gm if they are to be explained as stellar transients . of these three sources ,",
    "only sn  2003gm is clearly a bright mid - ir source , while we only obtained upper limits for sn  1997bs and sn  1954j .",
    "the optical light curves of sn  1997bs require dust formation with an optical depth of order @xmath649 after 9 months strongly indicating that the mass loss rate was high for an extended period after the transient faded in the optical .",
    "sn  1999bw , sn  2001ac , and sn",
    "2002bu ( and possibly sn  2003gm ) seem more likely to have the physics of sn  2008s ( see @xcite ) as previously noted for most of these cases in @xcite .",
    "they generally show signs of extinction at peak , become completely obscured post - transient , have long lived luminosities of @xmath650 to @xmath511 , and show some signs that the dust initially appears at radii larger than allowed by the expansion speed .",
    "like sn  2008s , these systems were probably obscured by dust forming in a dense pre - existing wind .",
    "the dust is then largely destroyed by the transient but then starts to reform as the transient fades because of the very high wind densities .",
    "the reformed dust again cloaks the system and the late time luminosity is powered by the continued expansion of the shock wave through the wind .",
    "the case is strongest for sn  1999bw , whose mid - ir sed changed little between april 2004 and may 2008 .",
    "two of the sources we consider , sn  2000ch and sn  2002kg / v37 , are optically variable sources without strong mass loss or significant dust creation .",
    "both sources have also had repeated episodes of optical variability ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "sn  2002 kg shows no signs of dust , while sn  2000ch appears to have a low optical depth dusty wind . while they have been referred to as lbv s",
    ", the very luminous star associated with sn  2000ch has luminosity / temperature variations opposite ( @xcite ) from those normally associated with lbvs ( @xcite ) , while sn  2002kg / v37 is of fairly low luminosity for an lbv .",
    "the inverted color evolution of sn  2000ch could be created by the stellar variability modulating the dust properties of a wind though variations in the formation radius or grain size with stellar luminosity and mass loss rate .",
    "[ fig : lsum ] provides a summary of the luminosities of the progenitors and for the most recent mid - ir epoch for each object .",
    "we also include the estimates for sn  2008s and the 2008 ngc  300 transient from @xcite .",
    "there are many caveats to these estimates ( as discussed in the previous sections ) , but there are some general patterns .",
    "first , of the systems where we can estimate the progenitor luminosity , only the two sources known to simply be variable stars , sn  2002kg / v37 and sn  2000ch , can be above the frequently used luminosity limit of @xmath651 for lbvs ( e.g. @xcite ) . in general , these transients do not seem to be associated with very massive , very luminous stars , so the entire analogy with the ( great ) eruptions of lbvs seems weak since they are generally lower luminosity stars far from their eddington limits .",
    "these are largely transients from stars with @xmath652 , which corresponds to @xmath653 in the @xcite models .",
    "as noted in @xcite , they also have far higher expansion velocities than is typically observed for the shells around galactic lbvs .",
    "this could be related to the observation by @xcite that the envelopes of lower mass ( @xmath654 ) stars are far less tightly bound , which makes it far easier for them to produce lower luminosity and energy ( explosive ) transients . broadly speaking",
    ", there is no convincing evidence that there is any relationship between the progenitors of the supernova impostors and lbvs .",
    "second , in all cases where we have information on both the progenitor luminosity and the late time luminosity of a ( potentially ) surviving star , there is no evidence that the stars ever become significantly sub - luminous compared to their progenitors .",
    "physically , this is expected because stars are self - gravitating systems and essentially can not be significantly sub - luminous at the surface without also being out of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "if significantly sub - luminous , a star must start to dynamically contract , and the potential energy release returns the star to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the recovery time discussed by @xcite , @xmath655 , is not really relevant for the stellar luminosity because the dominant means of reheating an envelope with too little thermal energy is kelvin - helmholtz contraction rather than the energy radiated from the interior .",
    "moreover , the sources observed at late times are frequently brighter rather than fainter than their progenitors",
    ".    figures  [ fig : masssum1 ] and [ fig : masssum2 ] compare the mass loss estimates from the sed models to the predictions given in table  [ tab : objects2 ] for radiatively ( @xmath83 from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : mdotmax ] ) and explosively ( @xmath82 from eqn .  [ eqn : mdiff ] ) driven transients .",
    "in most cases , either scenario is arguably consistent with the mass required to support the observed optical depths given all the other uncertainties . if the transients are driven radiatively and all the mass has to be ejected in @xmath12 , then a large fraction of the available energy / luminosity has to be used to accelerate the ejected material .",
    "if , however , much of the mass loss occurs over a period significantly longer than the optical transient , as seems to be the case for many of the systems ( e.g @xmath2  carinae and sn  1997bs in particular ) , there should be little difficulty radiatively driving the necessary mass loss .",
    "the two problematic systems in either scenario are sn  1954j and sn  1999bw , where far more mass is needed to produce the late - time optical depths than can be accounted for in either model .",
    "extending the transient in sn  1999bw can help , but seems unlikely to solve the problem .",
    "sn  1954j is still more problematic because the @xmath226  year time scale makes the dust radius very large and hence requires a great deal of ejected mass to retain a finite optical depth .",
    "these are the clearest cases where the mass estimates appear to require different physics , where the simplest solution is to use a longer lived wind for sn  1954j and to make sn  1999bw an object like sn  2008s and the 2008 ngc  300 transient .",
    "it is not a coincidence that the oldest systems other than @xmath2 carinae show the greatest problems , because systems with different physics that are then modeled as an ejected shell will have estimates of @xmath127 that will tend to increase with the elapsed time ( as @xmath656 ) .",
    "observing such a trends for the younger systems ( e.g. sn  2002bu , sn  2008s , and the ngc  300 transient ) would provide additional evidence that they are a separate class of transients .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : mechanism ] shows estimates of the ratio of radiated to kinetic energy @xmath657 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : me ] ) as another diagnostic of the transient mechanism .",
    "we show it as a function of the silicate dusty model optical depths @xmath125 , which can be used as a proxy for changes in the ejecta mass since @xmath658 and @xmath659 .",
    "the picture is broadly similar for the graphitic models .",
    "most of these transients are more consistent with an explosive origin for the transient , with @xmath88 . while a radiatively driven transient can have @xmath88 when the observed luminosity is significantly less than the true luminosity because most of it is absorbed into accelerating the ejecta ( eqn .  [ eqn : mdotmax ] , @xcite )",
    ", it is difficult to then understand why these systems show no significant differences in their external appearance . a number of systems , particularly sn  1954j , sn  1999bw",
    ", sn  2008s have @xmath397 and probably can not be reconciled with a short duration radiatively driven process .",
    "we argued in @xcite that sn  2008s and the ngc  300 transient had to be explosive in nature in order to explain the destruction of the dust that obscured the progenitors , so perhaps all these transients are driven by an initial ( weak ? ) explosion , as discussed in @xcite . after ejecting some mass in the initial optical transient ,",
    "many of the systems then move into a high mass loss state as the envelope re - equilibrates following the explosion in order to explain the wind - like features needed to explain many of the systems .    for the present study we have simply assumed that there is a surviving star powering the present day emissions . aside from the variable stars sn  2000ch and sn  2002 kg",
    ", there is no solid evidence this is correct .",
    "most of the observed luminosities are also consistent with being powered by a shock expanding through a dense circumstellar medium as @xcite posited for sn  2008s and the ngc  300 transient .",
    "optical spectra or x - ray observations can test this hypothesis , but for heavily obscured sources behind a veil of dust and gas it is difficult to make these tests .",
    "the most powerful argument against these sources being sne remains the overall energetics , but it is awkward that no compelling case can be made for any other mechanism ( see , for example , the discussions in @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "the biggest problem for characterizing these sources is the fragmentary nature of the data . in particular , it is almost certain that some of our particular conclusions are incorrect because we are interpreting such fragmentary data .",
    "for example , many of the sources show signs of absorption at the transient peak , but there are no near / mid - ir observations to detect the emissions that result if the dust is circumstellar ",
    "sn  1999bw and sn  2002bu may well have had their peak emissions in the mid - ir rather than the optical .",
    "since we now know that dust and dust formation in the ejecta are a key part of the physics , it is essential to characterize these transients beyond the time scales on which dust can form , typically 6 months to a year , both in the optical to observe the increasing optical depth , and in the near / mid - ir to determine the dust temperature / formation radius .",
    "the evolution in the following year rapidly determines whether the mass loss was associated with the short optical transient or if the star has entered a high mass loss state and is generating a relatively steady wind . at later times",
    ", we should both see the dust temperature dropping and the reappearance of the stars as the optical depth drops . for the objects we discuss ,",
    "most of the questions can be answered by coarsely monitoring their optical through mid - ir seds over a period of years . in the optical and near - ir",
    "this is relatively straight forward given the capabilities of hst but will require greater wavelength coverage and moderately deeper exposures than have generally been obtained .",
    "warm spitzer can effectively monitor the mid - ir emission in the short term , but jwst may be required to address some final puzzles because it will largely eliminate the problem of confusion and will again allow measurements at the longer wavelengths ( principally @xmath660-@xmath185 m ) needed to fully characterize the dust emission .",

    "<S> the durations and energetics of these transients can not be properly characterized without near / mid - ir observations , and the fragmentary nature of the available data leads to considerable uncertainties in our understanding of the individual sources . </S>",
    "<S> continued monitoring of the sources at both optical and near / mid - ir wavelengths should resolve these ambiguities . </S>"
