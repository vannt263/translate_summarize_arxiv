    "entanglement is at the heart of quantum information processing @xcite , and is a resource that allows quantum processes to outperform their classical counterparts for tasks such as computation @xcite , communication @xcite , and cryptography @xcite .",
    "the standard way to generate entanglement between distinguishable and initially separable particles is to let them interact directly for a certain amount of time : any non - trivial two - body hamiltonian is capable of generating entanglement in this manner @xcite .",
    "however , the direct interaction method poses limitations in the context of the generation of _ long - range _ entanglement , since in many systems the interaction strength typically decreases at least as fast as some power of the distance between particles .",
    "here we introduce a different paradigm for entanglement generation : we show that it is possible _ to entangle two particles that never interact directly by means of repeated measurements of a third subsystem that interacts with both_. in addition to its conceptual interest , we show that this scheme offers practical advantages for long - range entanglement generation .",
    "we remark that other alternatives to the direct interaction method for entanglement generation are well known .",
    "e.g. , in @xcite linear optics is augmented by _",
    "measurements _ to generate entanglement and perform quantum computation .",
    "measurements of the phase of light transmitted through a cavity have also been proposed in @xcite as a method to prepare entangled states and implement quantum computation in the case of atoms in optical cavities .",
    "_ decoherence _ can also be used to create entanglement : e.g. , atoms in a leaky cavity can become entangled conditioned on null detection at a photo detector placed outside the cavity @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite entanglement is generated in a similar manner conditioned instead upon detection .",
    "here we present a rather general theoretical framework for measurement - generated entanglement .",
    "our scheme is inspired by the recent work by nakazato , takazawa , and yuasa ( nty ) @xcite , who investigated the effects of repeated rapid projective measurements on one subsystem of a bipartite system .",
    "provided that the resulting operator on the unobserved subsystem has a non - degenerate largest eigenvalue , nty showed that _ the unobserved subsystem is gradually projected into a pure state , independent of the initial state_. this result leads to the question of whether a similar measurement scheme is capable of generating entanglement when the unobserved subsystem is itself multi - partite , non - interacting , and in an arbitrary initial state .",
    "we answer this question in the affirmative for a wide range of model systems , and establish general conditions for validity of the method .",
    "we note that an additional advantage of this measurement - based method for generating entanglement over the direct - interaction based method is that does not depend on sensitive timing of interactions : instead , entanglement is gradually purified as the number of measurements increases , and ( under appropriate conditions ) can be made arbitrarily high .",
    "an important conclusion from our study is that the method can be used to establish long range entanglement between distant particles , by measuring along a chain of intermediate particles .",
    "this provides an alternative to entanglement swapping that does not scale with the chain length . a similar result ",
    "long range entanglement from local ( but non - repeated ) measurements  was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the ground state of an antiferromagnetic spin chain .",
    "we now turn a detailed description of our method .",
    "nty considered the following scenario : consider a bi - partite system composed of subsystems @xmath0 , initially in the separable state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is in a pure state latexmath:[$%",
    "@xmath2 is subject to projective measurements @xmath4 applied with period @xmath5 . in between measurements",
    "the system evolves under the hamiltonian @xmath6 ( resp . ,",
    "the sum of free hamiltonians and an interaction ) . it can be shown @xcite that after @xmath7 such measurements the state of subsystem @xmath8 , _ given _ that all outcomes were @xmath9 , is @xmath10where @xmath11 is the survival probability , i.e. , the probability of finding subsystem @xmath2 in its initial state,@xmath12 \\label{successprob}\\]]where @xmath13 ( we use units where @xmath14 ) , and where @xmath15is an operator on subsystem @xmath16 that is in general _ not _ hermitian . however , one may still find left- and right - eigenvectors with complex eigenvalues",
    ", whose modulus can be shown to be bounded between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the central result of nty is that in the limit of large @xmath7 and small but finite @xmath5 , @xmath19 _ tends to a pure state independent of _ @xmath16 _ _ s initial state__. this result assumes that the largest eigenvalue @xmath20 of @xmath21 is non - degenerate .",
    "the final pure state @xmath19 is then the corresponding right eigenvector @xmath22 and this outcome is found with probability @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the corresponding left eigenvector .",
    "note that because of @xmath5 s finiteness the dynamics here is distinct from the zeno effect and quantum zeno dynamics  facchi : prl02 .",
    "we now extend nty s model by allowing @xmath16 itself to be composed of multiple _ non - interacting _ subsystems , @xmath25 , and pose the question : is the nty measurement procedure capable of generating entanglement amongst @xmath16 s subsystems , assuming that they all interact with the station  @xmath2 ?",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figone ] . to answer this questions we consider the following model :  we set all internal hamiltonians @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 ( equivalently , we can always transform to an interaction picture rotating with the internal hamiltonians ; this will make @xmath28 time dependent , but it will not introduce couplings between subsystems @xmath29 ) .",
    "we assume that the @xmath16 subsystems are all qubits and the interaction between @xmath2 and all the @xmath30 is identical .",
    "we can then define total quasi - spin operators @xmath31 and write the interaction as @xmath32 ( @xmath33 real ) or , more simply , @xmath34where the parameters @xmath33 are included in the vector @xmath35 .",
    "we do not restrict subsystem @xmath2 .     and",
    "@xmath36 are coupled to system @xmath2 ; system @xmath2 can be measured with a projective measurement .",
    "note that no direct coupling exists between systems @xmath37 and @xmath36.,width=264 ]",
    "we construct a basis that block - diagonalizes the effective post - measurement evolution operator @xmath21 . let a basis for the @xmath2 subsystem be the measurement state @xmath38 and any set of states orthonormal to it , denoted @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be even and let a basis for the @xmath16 subsystem be constructed out of the usual spin basis @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the total quasi - spin of the @xmath41 particles and @xmath44 its projection along the @xmath45-axis .",
    "we denote the ( orthonormal ) singlet states by @xmath46 , @xmath47 $ ] , and the remaining ( orthonormal ) states with @xmath48 by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .    _ proposition 1 _ :  consider the ordered basis @xmath52 . in this basis",
    "we have the block - diagonal representation @xmath53where @xmath54 is a @xmath55-dimensional identity matrix .",
    "the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath21 is @xmath18 , and is at least @xmath56-fold degenerate .",
    "_ proof _ : the singlets states , @xmath57 , are annihilated by the @xmath58 when @xmath41 is even ( since they are states with zero total quasi - spin )",
    ". therefore @xmath59 , independent of the state of subsystem @xmath2 . in the ordered basis @xmath28",

    "taking the expectation value wrt @xmath9 we then find:@xmath67which is the claimed result , with @xmath68 a @xmath61-dimensional matrix . that the maximal eigenvalue is @xmath18 follows from unitarity of @xmath69 @xcite , and that it is at least @xmath56-fold degenerate is immediate from the representation ( [ eq : vb - blockrep ] ) .",
    "qed    _ proposition 2 _ @xcite : non - degeneracy of @xmath21 is a necessary condition for obtaining a pure state in the limit of large @xmath7 .",
    "_ proof _ : in the degenerate case it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhob])that the method yields an equally weighted sum of degenerate pure states corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath21 .",
    "qed    note that @xmath70 .",
    "hence in the totally symmetric case we have been considering so far , for @xmath71 _ the method will generate a pure ( maximally entangled ) singlet state _",
    ", provided @xmath72 has maximal eigenvalue with modulus smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "we give examples of corresponding hamiltonians below . on the other hand , @xmath73 and hence due to degeneracy the method will not produce a pure entangled state for @xmath74 .",
    "however , we can still generate pure - state entanglement in the @xmath75 case by breaking the total permutation symmetry and only preserving the symmetry between @xmath76 and @xmath77 [ e.g. , having a coupling to subsystem @xmath2 such that @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "we can then project out a _",
    "one_-dimensional subspace @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the singlet state , which is entangled for @xmath76 and @xmath77 but separable across the @xmath82 partition .",
    "similarly , for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 the projected state is @xmath86 .",
    "the results of the above discussion are invariant as long as the hamiltonians belong to the family @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is an arbitrary unitary transformation of the hamiltonian of subsystem @xmath16 .",
    "this enables the method to generate entangled states equivalent under local transformations .",
    "the invariance of @xmath89 is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "thus , e.g. , in the case of @xmath71 , we can generate the other three bell states by applying @xmath93 ( where @xmath94 is the pauli matrix @xmath95 acting on subsystem @xmath96 , etc . ) , which results , respectively , in @xmath97 as the outcome of the method .",
    "what happens when there are other states , either singlets or coming from @xmath98 , that also have an eigenvalue with modulus @xmath18 ? in this case nty s result does not apply and entanglement may or may not be spoiled ( though it is always reduced from maximally entangled ) .",
    "two examples will illustrate : ( i ) @xmath71 :  suppose there is a triplet state @xmath99 that also has @xmath100 .",
    "then the resulting state is the mixture @xmath101 .",
    "this state is entangled as its partial transpose @xcite has a negative eigenvalue of @xmath102 .",
    "we will encounter this case in the heisenberg model below .",
    "( ii ) @xmath75 :  suppose the two singlet states @xmath103 and @xmath104 $ ] ( where @xmath105 are triplets with projection quantum number @xmath106 ) appear with eigenvalue one , but no other states do .",
    "with respect to the @xmath82 cut latexmath:[$%    clearly entangled .",
    "this state , just like in the previous example , has negative partial transpose , and we have entanglement _ across the _ @xmath82__cut__.",
    "these examples illustrate that degeneracy still allows for _ mixed state entanglement _ to be generated by our method .",
    "this is useful entanglement in the sense that it can be used for teleportation and all other qip primitives @xcite .",
    "we now discuss examples , first limiting ourselves to @xmath2 being a qubit and @xmath108 .",
    "our task then reduces to calculating the eigenvalues of the @xmath109 matrix @xmath110 .",
    "however , this requires diagonalization of @xmath111 , an @xmath112 matrix , so can not be done analytically in complete generality .",
    "our basis for @xmath2 is @xmath113 and for @xmath16 is @xmath114 without loss of generality ( recall the invariance discussion above ) .",
    "suppose @xmath115 and @xmath116 satisfy @xmath117=[a_{y},a_{x}^{2}]=0 $ ] ( or @xmath118 or @xmath119 whence the hamiltonian reads @xmath120/2 $ ] .",
    "we first consider as a special case the @xmath121 model : @xmath122 and @xmath123 , relevant for quantum information processing in solid state @xcite and atomic @xcite systems .",
    "it follows after some algebra that @xmath124 , where @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , the evolution is @xmath126which means that @xmath72 is a function only of @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in particular , for the @xmath129 model we find , using @xmath130 ,    @xmath131    where @xmath132 , etc .",
    "it is simple to check that , as required from our general result , @xmath133 , i.e. , the singlet state has eigenvalue @xmath18 .",
    "whether this eigenvalue is degenerate is now seen to depend on the measurement of the @xmath2 subsystem : if we choose @xmath9 to be a @xmath134-eigenstate then the additional eigenvalues of @xmath135 are found to be @xmath136 , while if we choose @xmath9 to be a @xmath137 or @xmath138-eigenstate then we find that the additional eigenvalues are @xmath139 , where @xmath140 .",
    "thus , if we measure along @xmath141 then there is never pure state entanglement , but at times @xmath5 other than @xmath142 we have a mixed entangled state , since the eigenstate corresponding to the additional eigenvalue @xmath18 is found to be @xmath143 ( and recall the discussion above ) . in the case of measurement along @xmath144 or @xmath145",
    "the eigenvalues periodically have modulus @xmath18 , and with the exception of those times degenerary is avoided and we do obtain a pure entangled state ( in particular , it is simple to show that this is true for all @xmath146 ) .",
    "next we consider the performance of the scheme after a _ finite _ number of steps ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . to do",
    "so we calculate the concurrence wootters:98",
    "after @xmath7 steps of evolution / measurement for @xmath147 , in the case of @xmath9 a @xmath95 eigenstate . in this case ,",
    "as shown above , the singlet state is generated by the scheme .",
    "we also plot the survival probability @xmath11 as given by eq .",
    "( [ successprob ] ) .",
    "after as few as three measurements the concurrence is essentially unity , indicating that the system is already in the desired singlet state .",
    "the scheme does , however , not work with unit probability : the probability @xmath11 of having projected system @xmath2 on the desired @xmath148 eigenstate converges to @xmath149 for the values above , a value reached for @xmath150 .    ) and success probability ( @xmath151 ) @xmath11 for @xmath152 and @xmath153.,width=264 ]    as another special case we consider a simplified form of the _ d_-wave grain boundary qubit @xcite:@xmath154 ( @xmath155 is a tunneling parameter and @xmath156 is the josephson coupling ) .",
    "thus @xmath157 , and we may use the general result ( [ eq8 ] ) , replacing @xmath158 by @xmath159 . if we now choose @xmath9 to be a @xmath134-eigenstate then @xmath160 turns out to be unitary and hence all its eigenvalues have modulus one , and no entanglement is generated .",
    "however , if we choose @xmath9 to be a @xmath95-eigenstate , we find @xmath161where @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "it is again easy to check that @xmath164 .",
    "one of the other three eigenvalues is @xmath165 the other two are complex conjugates and for short times @xmath5 such that @xmath166 have the same amplitude @xmath167 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath168 the amplitudes of the three eigenvalues are @xmath169 , which vanish rapidly when raised to the power of the number of measurements .",
    "finally , note that the results presented so far are not restricted to @xmath2 being a qubit : the unitary operator ( [ eq8 ] ) is valid even when @xmath2 is a multi - level system , as long as the condition @xmath117=[a_{y},a_{x}^{2}]=0 $ ] is satisfied .",
    "we now consider the heisenberg interaction @xmath170 . after showing that @xmath171 and @xmath172=0 $ ] , it is simple to compute @xmath173 , from which we directly obtain    @xmath174/3\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath135 then is identical to @xmath175 provided one replaces with @xmath176 @xmath177 the operator @xmath178 in @xmath175 .",
    "the four eigenvalues are @xmath179 , the last two having the same amplitude @xmath180 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are , respectively , @xmath181 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) ] .",
    "since the first two eigenvalues both have magnitude @xmath18 , we have the case discussed above :  a pure entangled state can not be projected out by our method , but we can prepare a mixed entangled state that is useful for all qip  protocols . note further that these heisenberg model results hold for the entire class of hamiltonians @xmath182 , when @xmath183 is generated from an arbitrary @xmath184-dimensional unitary transformation @xmath185 , @xmath186 @xmath187 ( this is different from the invariance under a rotation of the @xmath16 system considered above ) .",
    "we now consider a photon or phonon ( @xmath2 ) interacting symmetrically with two identical qubits ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian is@xmath188\\]]where @xmath189 is a bosonic annihilation operator , and whence @xmath190 .",
    "such a model can easily be realized using microwave cavity qed @xcite ( two atoms in one or two cavities ) or trapped ions @xcite .",
    "we can exactly diagonalize @xmath191 by writing it as a direct sum over three - dimensional matrices in the basis @xmath192 @xmath193 and @xmath194 , where @xmath195 are number states and @xmath196 are triplet states of the two qubits .",
    "note that @xmath197 $ ] is a conserved quantity and hence @xmath191 is block diagonal in its eigenvalues . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case with @xmath198 and measure the single photon state  @xmath199 ( this projects onto a single block of the infinite matrix @xmath175 ) . in this case",
    "we readily find the already diagonal @xmath200 in the ordered basis @xmath201 .",
    "thus , as long as we make sure that @xmath202 the method will project out a pure singlet state .",
    "it follows from our discussion of invariance above that another bell state @xmath203 can be projected out if the two qubits couple to the photon or phonon with opposite signs .",
    "let us now consider a rather general , though abstract multilevel case .",
    "assume that subsystem @xmath16 consists of two particles that have @xmath204 levels each , and that the interaction hamiltonian with subsystem @xmath2 ( also an @xmath7-level system ) is of the form    @xmath205    where @xmath206 and @xmath207 is a matrix whose elements are zero everywhere except for a @xmath18 at position @xmath208 .",
    "namely , there is an @xmath209 symmetry for odd @xmath7 or an @xmath210 symmetry for even @xmath7 . in this case",
    "@xmath191 has a _ single _ non - degenerate eigenvector with _",
    "zero _ eigenvalue .",
    "this state is entangled .",
    "for instance , when @xmath211 , we have two qutrits , which can be represented in the spherical basis @xmath212 .",
    "the state with zero eigenvalue is @xmath213and is maximally entangled . in general , the one - dimensional subspace containing the state with zero eigenvalue is the irreducible representation @xmath214 of @xmath209 or @xmath210 .",
    "this state is the generalization of the singlet state that arose in the general theory and examples treated above when the subsystems were qubits .",
    "it is apparent from the above examples that the success of our method depends on keeping the period @xmath5 between two measurements short . for instance , in the bosonic example , we require @xmath202 in order to prevent the appearance of another eigenvalue with amplitude one . let us therefore consider a short - time expansion of @xmath21 . to first order @xmath215 where @xmath216 ( constant )",
    ", i.e. , the evolution is unitary .",
    "this is the quantum zeno effect , which completely decouples the interaction among all parties of subsystem @xmath16 , so that no entanglement can be generated in this limit .",
    "thus the dominant contribution to entanglement generation originates from the second - order term , which contains the _ self - correlation _ of subsystem @xmath16 . consider for simplicity the case @xmath217 ( as in our last example ) . letting @xmath218 ( constant )",
    ", we have @xmath219all eigenstates of @xmath220 with nonzero eigenvalues are rapidly suppresed as @xmath221 ( in practice @xmath7 ) increases , while those with eigenvalue zero survive .",
    "since it is much simpler to analytically calculate @xmath222 than @xmath21 , this perturbative method provides a relatively simple tool for estimating the possibility of entanglement generation via our method , for complicated systems .",
    "we consider spin - orbital coupling as another illustrative example : @xmath223 , denoting two spin qubits that couple with the same orbital angular momentum .",
    "if we measure the eigenstate @xmath224 of the orbital component , we find @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath227 with respective eigenvectors @xmath181 , meaning that the singlet state @xmath228 is projected out in the second - order analysis .",
    "note that this example is qualitatively different from the previous one since subsystem @xmath2 here does not refer to a physically separate particle .",
    "finally we come to our main result : the generation of long - distance bi - partite entanglement . since in our discussion above there was no restriction on the size of the @xmath2 subsystem , in a sense long - distance entanglement generation already follows from the results above . however , it is important to specify how the measurements on @xmath2 can be carried out .",
    "assume that the @xmath2 subsystem is composed of @xmath229 qubits @xmath230 and we wish to entangle the two @xmath16-subsystem qubits @xmath231 .",
