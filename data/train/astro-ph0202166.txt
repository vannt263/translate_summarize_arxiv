    "the stellar population properties of early - type galaxies represent a key challenge for theories of galaxy formation . in hierarchical models of galaxy formation ,",
    "more massive galaxies have longer assembly timescales and therefore younger mean ages ( kauffmann 1996 ) . without taking metallicity effects into account ,",
    "this results in more massive galaxies having bluer colors in contradiction to the observational evidence ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) .",
    "it is well known , that metallicity can be traded for age .",
    "therefore , by assuming that metallicities steeply increase with the mass of the galaxy , the blueing due to age effects can be masked by metallicity . in this way hierarchical galaxy formation models are able to produce the correct slope of the color magnitude relation ( kauffmann & charlot 1998 ) .",
    "it remains open , however , if the correct ages of early - type galaxies are predicted .",
    "a meaningful test of the model must include the direct comparison of predicted and observed ages .    a powerful tool to derive ages and metallicities are absorption line indices ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "under the assumption that the stellar populations of ellipticals do not exhibit a significant spread in metallicity ( maraston & thomas 2000 ) , a combination of the lick indices @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ( faber et al .  1985 ) serves to disentangle age and metallicity .",
    "still , this approach is hampered by the fact that the data of elliptical galaxies lie below the models in the @xmath3-@xmath5-index diagram ( e.g. , worthey , faber , & gonzlez 1992 ; davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ) .",
    "more precisely , the mg lines observed in elliptical galaxies are stronger  at a given fe line strength ",
    "than predicted by population synthesis models . as a consequence ,",
    "mg line indices yield higher metallicities and younger ages than the fe line indices , which indicates the presence of [ @xmath0 ] enhanced stellar populations .",

    "a non - ambiguous derivation of ages therefore requires population synthesis models with variable @xmath0  ratios , and the consideration of the 3-dimensional parameter space of balmer , mg , and fe lines .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : models ] we present the main ingredients of our population synthesis models , whose calibration on globular clusters is shown in section  [ sec : calibration ] .",

    "we construct models with super - solar @xmath0  ratios by increasing the abundances of the @xmath7-elements ( i.e.  n , o , mg , ca , na , ne , s , si , ti ) and by decreasing those of the fe - peak elements ( i.e.  cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn ) , such that total metallicity is conserved ( trager et al .",
    "the abundances of carbon and all elements heavier than zinc are assumed not to vary .",
    "it is important to notice that super - solar @xmath7/fe ratios at constant total metallicity are accomplished mainly through a depletion of the fe - peak element abundances , because total metallicity is made up predominantly by oxygen and the other @xmath7-elements .",
    "the abundance variations of individual elements in the stellar atmospheres certainly impact on the observed absorption - line strengths of a stellar population .",
    "this effect represents the principal ingredient in the present @xmath7/fe - enhanced models .",
    "the variations of the lick absorption line indices owing to the element abundance changes described in the previous section are taken from tripicco & bell ( 1995 ; hereafter tb95 ) .",

    "the impact of the abundance variations on the temperature of the isochrone is on purpose not considered by tb95 .",

    "2000a ) .    the index variation @xmath18 of the index @xmath14 is then given by the product of the total fractional index changes @xmath19 from tb95 and the value of the index @xmath14 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath15 is calculated in tb95 for @xmath20 , so that this procedure is in principle only valid for metallicities reasonably close to solar .",
    "indeed , with this prescription the @xmath7/fe ratios of galactic globular clusters can not be reproduced , the fractional index changes given by tb95 turn out to be by far too small at metallicities @xmath21 . as a first - order approximation",

    "it should also be emphasized that at metallicities relevant for early - type galaxies and metal - rich globular clusters , i.e.  @xmath23\\leq 0.5 $ ] , the difference between fractional response and absolute response in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : responses ] has only a marginal effect on the resulting ssp models ( see thomas et al .  2002 ) .",
    "tb95 compute the variations of the individual lick indices on model atmospheres with well defined values of temperature and gravity .",
    "these values are chosen to be representative of the three evolutionary phases dwarfs ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , turnoff ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) and giants ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , on the 5  gyr , solar metallicity isochrone used by the authors .",
    "we separate the turnoff region from the dwarfs on the main sequence at 5000  k , independent of age and metallicity .",
    "note that the impact on the final model from varying this temperature cut - off as a function of age and metallicity is negligible ( thomas et al .",
    "we assign the sub giant branch phase to the turnoff because of the very similar @xmath8  and @xmath30 .",
    "the evolutionary phase ` giants ' consist of the red giant branch , the horizontal branch , and the asymptotic giant branch phases .",
    "the lick indices are computed for each evolutionary phase separately , and modified according to the response functions presented in eqn .",

    "the link between lick absorption line indices and the stellar parameters temperature , gravity , and metallicity is provided by stellar libraries that inevitably reflect the chemical history of the milky way .",
    "this implies that every population synthesis model suffers from a bias in the @xmath0  ratio , i.e.  the model does not reflect solar @xmath0  at all metallicities ( borges et al .",

    "the use of such models is particularly important for the interpretation of metal - poor stellar systems like ( extragalactic ) globular clusters or dwarf spheroidal galaxies .      in principle",
    "the element abundance variations in a star affect also the star s evolution and the opacities in the stellar atmosphere , hence the effective temperature",
    ". a fully consistent @xmath7/fe - enhanced ssp model should therefore consider @xmath7-enhanced stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "the impact of non - solar @xmath7/fe ratios on stellar evolution , however , was very controversially discussed in the literature ( see discussion in trager et al .",

    "this effect comes from the different partial time derivatives of the mg and the fe indices at ages below 1  gyr .",
