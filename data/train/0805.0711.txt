    "monte carlo ( mc ) studies of phase transitions have given rise to several cluster algorithms such as the swendsen - wang ( sw ) @xcite or wolff algorithm @xcite , which brought an important improvement to simulations by reducing the critical slowing down .",
    "more recently another cluster algorithm was proposed by machta _",
    "@xcite , inspired by the invasion percolation with an additional advantage that it self - regulates to the critical point and does not require prior knowledge of the critical temperature .",
    "it was applied to various classical models of phase transitions @xcite , and extended to more complex cases , from frustration @xcite to tricritical points @xcite .",
    "the price to be paid is that the configurations generated by this self - adjusting nonequilibrium process are not distributed according to the canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "thus , although the ic algorithm can be used to analyze a certain number of properties at criticality , those which are describing fluctuations remain out of its reach .",
    "this question was analyzed from different aspects @xcite and an alternative self - adjusting algorithm based on a modification of the swendsen - wang algorithm was proposed @xcite .    by following a different approach",
    ", we propose an equilibriumlike invaded cluster ( eic ) algorithm obtained by constraining temperature uncertainty characteristic to the invaded cluster ( ic ) algorithm into limits compatible with the equilibrium distribution .",
    "we show that by applying this single constraint to the ic algorithm , correct scaling properties of thermodynamic observables are reproduced , while the algorithm still gives the critical temperature as an output .",
    "the method is demonstrated on the example of the potts model in two and three dimensions .",
    "we consider the potts model @xcite defined by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the @xmath2-state potts variable at the lattice site @xmath3 and the summation runs over the nearest neighbors only . the cluster algorithms including the ic algorithm are based on the fortuin and kasteleyn ( fk ) @xcite expansion , which shows that the partition function of the model ( [ dil_potts ] ) is equivalent to the one of the random - cluster ( rc ) model , which can be written as @xmath4 and understood as a generalized bond percolation , where @xmath5 is the bond probability ( @xmath6 is the boltzmann factor ) .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ rand_cluster ] ) runs over the set of all the graphs on the lattice @xmath7 , while each graph @xmath8 represents one possible bond configuration .",
    "@xmath9 is the number of the lattice edges , @xmath10 denotes the number of bonds , and @xmath11 is the number of connected components ( fk clusters ) in the graph @xmath8 .",
    "in standard cluster algorithms such as the sw or wolff algorithm , fk clusters are formed on a lattice by adding bonds between neighbors in the same state with a temperature - dependent probability @xmath12 ( [ p ] ) . the configuration is then randomized by flipping all the clusters to different states and the procedure is repeated from the beginning . in the ic algorithm by machta _",
    "the cluster formation phase is different since the probability @xmath12 is not given in advance .",
    "bonds are placed randomly between neighbors in the same state , until one of the clusters percolates .",
    "this is considered as a signature of the critical point in the system of finite size .",
    "the adding of bonds then stops , clusters are randomized and ready for the next iteration .",
    "the output that is recorded is the ratio @xmath13 where @xmath10 is the number of added bonds and @xmath14 the number of neighboring pairs in the same state for a given graph @xmath8 on a lattice .",
    "the average @xmath15 is identified with the quantity @xmath12 , yielding a critical temperature estimate .",
    "the procedure is self - adjusting to the critical temperature imposed by the stopping condition .",
    "namely , if during one step the excessive number of bonds is added , which would statistically contribute to a much lower temperature , in the next step the clusters will percolate easier due to large number of satisfied neighbors created , which will statistically contribute to temperatures much higher than critical .",
    "the problem is that the resulting oscillations in @xmath16 remain too large during the entire process . as a result it does not sample the canonical ensemble , but its proper _ ic ensemble",
    "_ , giving much broader distribution .",
    "since in the thermodynamic limit @xmath17 still holds , the ic algorithm is assumed to become equivalent in that limit to the canonical ensemble and to produce the same average values , including the correct @xmath18 .",
    "however , the convergence with size is more difficult to control .",
    "also , the variances in energy or magnetization do not describe the equilibrium fluctuations , but rather the specific ic dynamics .",
    "it is important here to notice that the variable @xmath12 of eq .",
    "( [ rand_cluster ] ) is an _ a priori _ bond probability and consequently @xmath16 should be distributed according to gaussian distribution with @xmath19 and the width @xmath20 . in the equilibrium cluster algorithms @xmath16",
    "appears as a random input variable which obviously is distributed according to normal distribution .",
    "as already mentioned , the distribution of @xmath16 generated as an output of the ic algorithm is far broader than @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "we propose a simple restriction to the ic algorithm , which sets the allowed range of @xmath16 to be proportional to @xmath21 and strictly less than @xmath22 .",
    "the procedure is straightforward and works as follows .",
    "the iterations are grouped in intervals of @xmath23 mc steps .",
    "\\(a ) during the first interval of @xmath23 mc steps we follow the original ic rule .",
    "the average value @xmath24 over the first @xmath23 iterations is found , to be used as an approximation for the next @xmath23 steps .",
    "\\(b ) in the next interval of @xmath23 mc steps the stopping rule is modified by requiring the system to percolate but with the constraint @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the parameter set to be proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "if the system percolates before the lower bound of @xmath28 is reached , the bonds are still added until the lower bound is attained .",
    "if the upper bound of @xmath16 is reached before percolation , the process is stopped without requiring the system to percolate . at the end of the interval ,",
    "the new average over @xmath16 , @xmath29 is calculated .",
    "\\(c ) in every consecutive interval @xmath3 of @xmath23 steps the bounds of @xmath16 are set by @xmath30 and the same stopping rule as in ( b ) applied .",
    "the first few intervals of @xmath23 steps are discarded and the configurations are recorded after the steady state has been reached .",
    "we remark that the width of the resulting distribution of @xmath16 has two contributions : ( a ) from the fluctuations of @xmath16 within a group of @xmath23 mc steps proportional to @xmath31 ; ( b ) from the fluctuations of the mean value @xmath32 that correspond to the actual temperature fluctuations , producing the width of order @xmath33 if the heat capacity exponent @xmath34 , or of order @xmath21 if @xmath35 .",
    "even when it decays as @xmath21 , it is much smaller than the contribution from ( a ) because @xmath32 is a result from averaging over @xmath23 mc steps .",
    "the value of @xmath23 is required to be large enough to allow the uncertainty of values of @xmath32 to be less than the variation of @xmath32 between the groups @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath36 of eic algorithm thus can be regulated by changing @xmath26 and is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , the width of the distribution of @xmath28 allowed during the entire process of iterations is within the same limits as in the conventional cluster algorithms , and we can consider that the temperature during the whole process is equally well defined .",
    "the question of the ensemble that eic algorithm generates is less trivial and we do not attempt here any detailed study of the exact connection between the eic and the canonical ensemble .",
    "we only point out that there is a nonzero probability of generating any spin configuration with any value of @xmath16 , so the ergodicity of the procedure is fulfilled .",
    "the numerical evidence will be given below that the eic algorithm samples the canonical ensemble well .",
    "the eic algorithm was applied to the cases @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the potts model in two and three dimensions , respectively . in two dimensions ( @xmath39 )",
    "exact results are known both for critical temperature and for the exponents , while in @xmath40 very accurate estimations are available @xcite .",
    "the simulations were performed on lattices with periodic boundary conditions , and moderate sizes up to @xmath41 and @xmath42 in 2d and 3d , respectively .",
    "the statistics varied from @xmath43 iterations for smaller to @xmath44 iterations for the largest lattice sizes .",
    "free parameters of the algorithm were chosen to be @xmath45 and interval @xmath46 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) .",
    "percolation was established by the topological rule , i.e. by the condition that the infinite cluster wraps around the lattice .     of the eic , sw and ic algorithm for the 3d ising model and sizes @xmath47 and @xmath48 rescaled with the same exponent @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 denotes the averaged energy of each individual curve .",
    "histograms of sw algorithm were taken at @xmath51 . ]",
    "we include for comparison the results obtained by the sw algorithm with the same lattice sizes and using the same statistics performed at two different temperatures : ( a ) at infinite system critical temperature ; i.e. , for @xmath52 ; ( b ) at l - dependent critical temperatures ; i.e. for @xmath53 approximated by previously calculated @xmath51 .",
    "such a choice is justified because the difference between @xmath51 and the position of e.g. the susceptibility maximum obtained by the sw algorithm for the lattice size @xmath54 is much smaller than its width . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are compared the energy histograms , generated by eic , sw and ic algorithms for the case @xmath38 , @xmath55 .",
    "all three sets were taken for sizes @xmath47 and @xmath48 and rescaled with the same exponent @xmath56 , set to produce the collapsing fit of the sw data .",
    "the distribution generated by eic algorithm is the narrowest one , due to the choice of the arbitrary constant factor in the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "more important is that the width of the eic histogram scales with the same exponent as the one of the canonical ensemble obtained by sw algorithm , so that the fluctuations in both ensembles follow the same law .",
    "also , by tuning the constant factor in @xmath26 , very good overlap can be established between the eic and sw histograms of all sizes . on the other hand , the width of the ic ensemble scales differently , consistent with the fact that the corresponding fluctuations follow the specific ic dynamics , and do not describe the equilibrium energy fluctuations at criticality .",
    "let us present now the obtained results for critical point and critical exponents summarized in table i.    first we examine the convergence of @xmath53 with size . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are presented data for @xmath53 vs @xmath57 , where the exact ( or best known ) value for @xmath58 was used .",
    "the obtained linear fits are very clean in comparison to the extrapolations within the ic algorithm ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , fig . 1 of the first ref . in @xcite ) , where the use of medians was necessary to reduce the additional size effects .",
    "the extrapolations to the limit @xmath59 are compared in table i to the known results for @xmath60 in @xmath39 ( calculated from the analytic expression @xmath61 @xcite ) and in @xmath40 @xcite and show the precision up to four or five significant digits already for modest sizes used here .     for cases",
    "@xmath62 , @xmath38 , @xmath63 and @xmath55 , @xmath38 .",
    "lines represent linear fits , using exact or best known results for @xmath64 . ]    [ tab1 ]    the estimations of the temperature critical exponent , @xmath65 were obtained from the power law form @xmath66 by taking the exact ( best known ) value for @xmath67 .",
    "the magnetic critical exponent was calculated in three different ways .",
    "we have calculated the fractal dimension of the percolation cluster @xmath68 and the anomalous dimension of the magnetization @xmath69 defined through the most populated of the q potts states @xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71 . \\\\\\ ] ]    . ]",
    "we also examined the fluctuations of magnetization ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) which in equilibrium are related to the susceptibility @xmath72 by the relation @xmath73,\\ ] ] which assumes the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , not fulfilled for the standard ic algorithm .",
    "eic results for all the quantities presented in table i agree with the exact , or best approximate results within a few percent .",
    "although we omit here the analysis of convergence , visible improvement of results was observed with increasing l , so that discrepancies could be attributed to relatively modest sizes used .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the simulations by sw algorithm with the same sizes produced very similar results .",
    "compared to those of the standard ic algorithm @xcite , the fits of quantities derived from the mean values at criticality , such as @xmath60 , @xmath65 , and @xmath74 are significantly improved . moreover ,",
    "the correct exponent is regained for the fluctuations of the magnetization , and the susceptibility shows the correct scaling within the same error margins as within a sw algorithm .",
    "to summarize , we have proposed an extension of the ic algorithm which recovers the correct sampling of the equilibrium ensemble at criticality and still preserves self - regulation to the critical temperature . by imposing on the distribution of the variable @xmath16 the width proportional to @xmath21 ( compatible with the gaussian distribution ) , we reduced the uncertainty of the temperature variable to the one in the equilibrium algorithms and obtained the correct scaling of the fluctuations at criticality . furthermore , our intervention does not slow down the ic algorithm , and the running times per mcs for the eic algorithm remain the same .",
    "for example , a run of @xmath75 mcs for 2d ising model on @xmath42 lattice requires approximately @xmath76 s on the amd opteron 240 processor ( 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "the procedure is illustrated on several cases of second - order phase transitions in the potts model in two and three dimensions belonging to different universality classes .    in comparison with the self - regulating algorithm by tomita and okabe @xcite ,",
    "this approach is conceptually different : their approach is an extension of the sw algorithm which allows variation in @xmath12 , which is directly related to the fluctuations of temperature , and the corresponding width is @xmath77 . as far as the efficiency is compared , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argue their algorithm to be faster per individual iterations since it does not require multiple checking of percolation during a single iteration . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite not less than 10000 mcs preparation steps were required before the iterations could be recorded , while in the eic approach not more than 2000 mcs were sufficient .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to compare the autocorrelation times for the two methods .      the improved convergence and possibility to calculate the correct scaling of fluctuations may be useful in a number of problems .",
    "it may have particular advantage in the cases with quenched disorder and lack of self - averaging , where calculations at the sample - dependent critical temperatures have to be performed , and where the standard ic algorithm was of limited efficiency @xcite .",
