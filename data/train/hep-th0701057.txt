    "in the weak regime we obtain the solution @xcite    @xmath232    again the critical value of the coupling constant @xmath199 is seen to occur at @xmath228 when the critical angle @xmath233 approaches @xmath234 . at this point",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath235 of @xmath174 will fill the whole unit circle .",
    "for very strong couplings the density of eigenvalues ( [ strong ] ) becomes a uniform distribution while in the very weak coupling region ( which corresponds to very small angles @xmath235 ) the density of eigenvalues ( [ ik ] ) reduces to wigner semicircle law , viz @xmath236    we can use this last equation to compute the free energy and specific heat for small values of the coupling constant @xmath140 with excellent agreement with the simulation results of ( [ main2 ] ) .",
    "the free energy is given by @xmath237 the factor of @xmath4 which multiplies @xmath238 comes from the fact that we have two identical independent one - plaquette models contributing to @xmath239 in accordance with ( [ gammad4 ] ) . in order to compute the specific heat",
    "we implement the scaling transformations @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "the specific heat is then defined by @xmath242 a straightforward calculation yields the very simple result @xmath243 this is precisely what we see numerically in the fuzzy sphere phase .",
    "the value @xmath10 emerges from the fact that we have two plaquettes .",
    "as it turns out this result is valid throughout the weak - coupling phase , i.e for all @xmath244 .    in the regime of strong couplings",
    "the free energy and specific heat are computed using the distribution of eigenvalues ( [ strong ] ) .",
    "we find    @xmath245    the specific heat in this phase is therefore given by @xmath246    [ [ the - phase - diagram ] ] the phase diagram + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    from equation ( [ u ] ) we can immediately see that for every value of the parameter @xmath163 the model ( [ gammad4 ] ) undergoes a third order phase transition from strong - coupling phase to weak - coupling phase consistent with the ordinary one - plaquette third order phase transition observed in @xmath4 dimensional gauge theory on the lattice @xcite .",
    "however in this case this transition occurs at the value @xmath247 of the gauge coupling constant @xmath140 which becomes smaller as we increase @xmath163 until it vanishes for @xmath248 . by definition",
    "the double scaling limit in which the fixed ratio @xmath163 is taken to infinity corresponds to the model ( [ gammad2 ] ) .",
    "indeed the partition function ( [ gammad2 ] ) is obtained from the partition function @xmath249 $ ] given by ( [ gammad3 ] ) in the limit in which we take @xmath160 first and then @xmath8 .",
    "hence we can immediately conclude that the model ( [ gammad2 ] ) does not undergo the above one - plaquette phase transition since @xmath250 when @xmath164 and furthermore this model according to the restriction ( [ range5 ] ) exists mostly in the matrix phase .    thus the model ( [ gammad4 ] ) with finite values of the ratio @xmath163 behaves as an ordinary @xmath251 lattice gauge model with a reduced one - plaquette critical value whereas in the limit @xmath164 the @xmath5rd order one - plaquette phase transition is completely removed from the model .",
    "this limit can be thought of as a way of regularizing the one - plaquette transition in the lattice model .",
    "however for @xmath165 the above computed critical value @xmath252 is not the correct critical value at which the third order phase transition should occur . the model ( [ gammad3 ] ) with the fixed ratio @xmath163 such that @xmath165 is a @xmath55 one - plaquette model which should be described by the partition function ( [ gammad4 - 0 ] ) and not by ( [ gammad4 ] ) .",
    "by going through the same steps which led to ( [ u ] ) we obtain for the model ( [ gammad4 - 0 ] ) the critical value @xmath253 or equivalently @xmath254 in above we have used the fact that the partition function ( [ gammad4 - 0 ] ) should really be used only for very small @xmath163 .",
    "clearly for @xmath255 the critical value @xmath256 and then it becomes negative for @xmath257 and hence the above formula should only be valid in the range @xmath258 .",
    "in other words the @xmath5rd order one - plaquette phase transition occurs at the values @xmath259 of @xmath140 for all @xmath258 whereas for @xmath260 the transition should occur at the values @xmath247 .",
    "the value @xmath261 seems to demarcate a discontinuity in the phase diagram .",
    "below @xmath261 the model ( [ gammad3 ] ) describes an ordinary @xmath55 gauge theory on one plaquette whereas above this value the model becomes the @xmath3 gauge theory on two plaquettes given by ( [ gammad4 ] ) which corresponds to noncommutative gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere .",
    "the numbers of degrees of freedom of the model below and above this critical mass @xmath262 are different . above @xmath261",
    "we have @xmath263 degrees of freedom whereas below this value we have @xmath264 degrees of freedom .    thus the model ( [ gammad3 ] ) with @xmath261 is seen to be the first noncommutative @xmath0 gauge model on the fuzzy sphere @xmath265 which we will obtain as we increase @xmath163 from @xmath266 to @xmath267 .",
    "indeed this model has the correct number of degrees of freedom given by @xmath263 and it can be reduced to ( [ gammad4 ] ) .",
    "the model with @xmath261 is also the noncommutative model with the largest `` fuzzy sphere '' phase in the sense of ( [ range5 ] ) hence the effects of the `` matrix '' phase are the weakest in this case . as a consequence",
    "the estimation of the critical point of the @xmath5rd order phase transition is most reliable using the model ( [ gammad3 ] ) with @xmath261 . at @xmath261 the critical value @xmath247 is given by @xmath268 .",
    "this computed critical value leads to the critical value of the coupling constant @xmath141 ( from equation ( [ mmm ] ) ) @xmath269 this is to be compared with the observed value @xmath270 seen in monte carlo simulation of the model ( [ main2 ] ) with the metropolis algorithm .",
    "the agreement is very good .",
    "thus it seems that the two noncommutative @xmath0 models given by ( [ main2 ] ) ( with large @xmath209 ) and ( [ gammad3 ] ) ( with @xmath261 ) are quantum mechanically equivalent in the fuzzy @xmath40 phase .",
    "we constructed in this article a one - parameter family of noncommutative @xmath0 gauge theory partition functions @xmath271 on the fuzzy sphere @xmath1 given by equation ( [ gammad3 ] ) .",
    "the idempotent @xmath80 is the chirality operator and @xmath140 is the gauge coupling constant . in the limit @xmath272",
    "the model becomes a @xmath55 one - plaquette model whereas in the limit @xmath160 we get the generalized @xmath3 one - plaquette model defined by ( [ gammad2 ] ) . in the double scaling limits",
    "@xmath162 keeping @xmath163 fixed @xmath273 we can show that quantum noncommutative @xmath0 gauge theory on the fuzzy sphere @xmath265 is equivalent to a @xmath3 nonabelian yang - mills theory on a two dimensional lattice with two plaquettes according to ( [ gammad4 ] ) .",
    "thus the model ( [ gammad3 ] ) ( with @xmath261 ) will undergo in the fuzzy sphere phase a @xmath5rd order one - plaquette large @xmath7 phase transition between weak - coupling and strong - coupling phases around the critical value ( [ 3.13 ] ) which is consistent with the observed @xmath5rd order transition point of ( [ main2 ] ) . in the `` matrix '' phase we will have a @xmath3 gauge theory on a single point .",
    "another evidence for this equivalence comes from the calculation of the specific heat which seems to agree with the simulation results of ( [ main2 ] ) both in the weak - coupling and strong - coupling phases up to the sphere - to - matrix first order transition where the whole spactime ( the sphere ) collapses . in particular",
    "the specific heat was found to be equal to @xmath10 in the fuzzy sphere weak - coupling phase of the gauge field which agrees with the observed value @xmath10 .",
    "the value @xmath10 comes precisely because we have two plaquettes which approximate the noncommutative @xmath0 gauge field on the fuzzy sphere . in the strong - coupling region deviations between ( [ lkjo ] ) and the data coming from the simulation of ( [ main2 ] )",
