    "a final remark is in order .",
    "we agree with the author of @xcite about the fact that , in order to understand better the behavior of @xmath40 in the qvo regime , the concept of adiabaticity violation _ on the whole neutrino trajectory _ is to be preferred to the concept of adiabaticity violation _ at the resonance point_. however , we do not share his pessimism about the possibility of using the running value @xmath168 for accurate calculations of @xmath40 : indeed , figs .",
    "5 - 7 just demonstrate this possibility .",
    "such pessimism seems to originate from the observation that , as @xmath66 decreases , @xmath40 starts to get nonlocal contributions from points rather far from @xmath70 @xcite . in our formalism",
    ", this behavior shows up in the @xmath109 limit [ eq .  ( [ r0limit ] ) ] , where , as mentioned in the previous section , the effective value of @xmath2 gets contributions from an extended portion of the density profile [ see also sec .  vi and appendix c for further discussions ] . our prescription ( [ modmva ] ) , however , effectively takes this fact into account , by matching the `` local '' behavior of @xmath2 for large @xmath66 [ @xmath169 with the `` nonlocal '' behavior of @xmath2 at small @xmath66 [ @xmath125 ] . in conclusion , the mva prescription , appropriately modified [ eq .",
    "( [ modmva ] ) ] to match the @xmath109 limit , allows a description of @xmath40 which is very accurate in the whole qvo range , and which smoothly matches the familiar resonance prescription up in the msw range .",
    "in this section , we discuss the last piece for the calculation of @xmath0 , namely , the solar phase @xmath56 . as we will see , this phase can significantly affect the quasivacuum oscillations of almost `` monochromatic '' solar neutrinos ( such as those associated to the @xmath171be and _ pep _ spectra ) .",
    "indeed , there might be favorable conditions in which the phase @xmath56 ( often negligible in current practical calculations ) could lead to observable effects and should thus be taken into account .",
    "first , let us observe that , in the qvo range , the size of the solar phase @xmath56 is of @xmath172 , as indicated by eq .",
    "( [ xianalyt ] ) for exponential density @xcite , and also confirmed through numerical calculations for ssm density @xcite .",
    "figure  9 shows , in particular , exact results for the ratio @xmath173 , as a function of @xmath25 , using the ssm density .",
    "it appears that , neglecting @xmath56 with respect to the vacuum phase @xmath58 , is almost comparable to neglect @xmath174 as compared with @xmath175 . remarkably , there are cases in which corrections of @xmath176 are nonnegligible , e.g. , in the study of time variations of @xmath0 over short time scales @xcite , induced by the earth orbit eccentricity ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "in fact , the fractional monthly variation of @xmath178 from aphelion to perihelion is @xmath179 .",
    "real - time experiments aiming to detect time variations of the @xmath3 flux in monthly bins might thus test terms of @xmath180 , as also emphasized at the end of sec .",
    "vi in the work @xcite .    secondly , let us recall that the oscillating term @xmath181 gets averaged to zero when the total phase @xmath55 is very large @xcite .",
    "the approximation @xmath182 holds in the msw regime , but it becomes increasingly inaccurate ( and is eventually not applicable ) as @xmath66 decreases down to the qvo regime . in order to understand when @xmath55 starts to be observable ( at least in principle ) one can consider an optimistic situation , namely , an ideal measurement of @xmath0 with a real - time detector having perfect energy resolution , and monitoring the flux from narrowest solar @xmath3 spectra ( the be and _ pep _ neutrino lines ) . in this case , the most important  and basically unavoidable  source of smearing is the energy integration @xcite over the @xmath3 lineshape .",
    "production zone is irrelevant in the qvo regime @xcite , see also appendix  a. ] it has been shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that such integrations effectively suppresses the oscillating term @xmath33 at the earth through a damping factor @xmath183 , calculable in terms of the @xmath3 lineshape .",
    "figure  8 shows the factor @xmath183 for the _ pep _ line and the for two be lines , characterized by average energies @xmath184 , 863.1 , and 385.5 kev , respectively .",
    "the be and _ pep _ lineshapes [ having @xmath185  kev widths ] have been taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "figure  8 proves that @xmath55 is observable , at least in principle , in the whole qv range @xmath130 ev@xmath26/mev , as far as the narrowest be line is considered .",
    "of course , the observability of @xmath55 becomes more critical ( or even impossible ) by increasing the initial energy spread ( e.g. , for continuous @xmath3 spectra ) or by performing measurements ( like in current experiments ) with additional and substantial detection smearing in the energy or time domain @xcite .    with the above caveats in mind",
    ", we set out to describe accurately @xmath56 in the whole qvo range .",
    "this task is accomplished in appendixes  d and e where , by means of the same perturbative method applied earlier to @xmath40 , we obtain the @xmath112 and @xmath71 expressions for @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the final perturbative result is @xmath186 which is in excellent agreement with the exact result for @xmath56 shown in fig .  9 , in the whole qvo range .",

    "the error is given as the absolute difference between approximate and exact results for @xmath56 , in units of a period ( @xmath190 ) .",

    "the density profile @xmath18 is better described by a power law rather than by an exponential function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , the upper limit can be shifted from @xmath221 to @xmath222 without appreciable numerical changes , and with the advantage that the result can be cast in a compact analytical form , reproducing the exact ssm numerical result with good accuracy : @xmath223    using the above equation and the results of appendixes  c and d , the small-@xmath66 limit for @xmath2 and @xmath56 can be explicited as @xmath224 such results show that the effective values of @xmath2 and of @xmath56 at small @xmath66 are connected to the parameters @xmath225 describing the power - law dependence of @xmath18 in the convective zone of the sun [ eq .  ( [ np ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , while for relatively large @xmath66 neutrino oscillations in matter probe the inner `` exponential bulk '' of the solar density profile , for small @xmath66 they mainly probe the outer , `` power - law '' zone of convection .    finally , let us notice that , in the range @xmath226 , where the `` running '' mva prescription @xmath227 is applicable , the power law in eq .",

    "the accuracy of the prescription is significantly improved ( up to @xmath244 in @xmath0 in the whole qvo range ) by replacing the familiar prescription of choosing the scale height parameter @xmath2 at the msw resonance point by a new one : @xmath2 is chosen at the point of maximal violation of adiabaticity ( mva ) along the neutrino trajectory in the sun .",
    "such generalization preserves a smooth transition of our prescription from the qvo to the msw oscillation regime , where the two prescriptions practically coincide .",

    "<S> we propose a simple prescription to calculate the solar neutrino survival probability @xmath0 in the quasivacuum oscillation ( qvo ) regime . </S>",
    "<S> such prescription is obtained by matching perturbative and exact analytical results , which effectively take into account the density distribution in the sun as provided by the standard solar model . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting analytical recipe for the calculation of @xmath0 is shown to reach its highest accuracy ( @xmath1 in the whole qvo range ) when the familiar prescription of choosing the solar density scale parameter @xmath2 at the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) resonance point is replaced by a new one , namely , when @xmath2 is chosen at the point of `` maximal violation of adiabaticity '' ( mva ) along the neutrino trajectory in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the mva prescription admits a smooth transition from the qvo regime to the msw transition one . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the phase acquired by neutrinos in the sun , and show that it might be of relevance for the studies of relatively short timescale variations of the fluxes of the solar @xmath3 lines in the future real - time solar neutrino experiments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we elucidate the role of matter effects in the convective zone of the sun . </S>"
