    "recent work has shown that strong segregation effects arise in smectic ( s ) phases of hard rods of equal diameter but different lengths when the two components are mixed in varying proportions . in seminal work koda and kimura@xcite analyzed a binary mixture of parallel hard cylinders using onsager approximation , and applied a stability analysis .",
    "they found two types of s phases : one in which layers are identical and contain a mixture of both types of particles , and another , microsegregated phase , which consists of alternating layers of different compositions . more recent",
    "work has focused on more general mixtures .",
    "for example , van roij and mulder@xcite studied a mixture of parallel cylinders of different diameters using onsager theory and a more complete bifurcation analysis .",
    "they observed that , for length ratios higher than 1:5 , n - n segregation ( where n stands for nematic phase ) preempts the n - s and n - c phase transitions ( c stands for columnar phase ) .",
    "more recent work by cinacchi et al.@xcite used an extended onsager theory ( eot ) on systems of hard spherocylinders ( hspcs ) , but lifting the restriction on orientations , and complete phase diagrams were obtained containing i ( isotropic ) , n , and s , phases . as was expected , a strong tendency toward segregation was observed , and microsegregated phases did also arise in the model , consisting of layers made up of the component in larger proportion the shorter rods alternating with weakly populated and highly interpenetrated layers of the longer rods . in the work by cinacchi et al .",
    "the only spatially ordered phase considered was the s phase .",
    "c phases are very common in nature , even in systems composed of prolate molecules . a simple",
    ", one - component model is known not to exhibit c ordering , which is preempted by the smectic phase .",
    "however , the c phase can be stabilized prior to crystallization in mixtures of hspc particles with orientations restricted to be parallel , as shown by stroobants et al.@xcite using computer simulation .",
    "bohle et al.,@xcite using a density functional based on the weighted - density approximation , considered the effect of polydispersity on the stabilization of ordered phases in systems of parallel hard rods .",
    "their conclusion is similar to that obtained previously by bates and frenkel , @xcite _ viz .",
    "_ , increasing the degree of polydispersity stabilizes the c phase with respect to the s phase .",
    "an identical behavior was observed in mixtures with perfectly bimodal length distributions@xcite ( i.e. , two - component mixtures ) .",
    "it is intuitively clear that orientational fluctuations , not taken into account in all of these studies , will tend to destroy columnar order , but the extent to which this statement is true in mixtures of hard rods is still unknown . as a consequence , a general concern is the question of whether phases of lower symmetry , c and crystal , may preempt all the structures observed in preliminary studies ; in particular , all previous studies have shown the c phase to be stable for systems of perfectly parallel rods , preempting the occurrence of the smectic phase for sufficiently large length ratios .",
    "also , in connection with the work by cinacchi et al.,@xcite a number of questions remain unanswered , particularly in relation with the theoretical model ( eot ) , its particular implementation , and the approximations used ( parametrization of the distribution functions , etc . ) .",
    "these are the aims of the present paper . in this paper",
    "we have not considered the occurrence of crystal phases , largely for two reasons : one is that in mixtures the crystal phase will certainly tend to appear at relatively high packing fractions , due to packing constraints , which will leave a large region where other spatially ordered phases may appear .",
    "another reason is that the eot is not well suited to study crystallization",
    ". therefore we will limit ourselves to studying the instability against general spatial fluctuations of the n phase .    in the present paper",
    "we address the above questions from two perspectives .",
    "one is the calculation , within eot , of the line where the nematic phase of the mixture gets unstable with respect to columnar - phase fluctuations .",
    "this line sets an approximate upper limit for the region where smectic phases should be stable .",
    "the other is the numerical minimization of a fundamental - measure functional as applied to systems of hard rods of square transversal section [ hard parallelepipeds ( hps ) ] in the zwanzig approximation , i.e. , considering that the rods can assume only three possible orientations , namely , along the cartesian axes @xmath0 . in this way , by using a completely different approach which possesses some advantages ( better treatment of hard - core correlations and exact formulation of excluded - volume effects ) and some disadvantages ( restricted orientations ) , we may verify whether the predictions of onsager theory are artifacts of the theory or of its particular implementation .",
    "we will see that some of the predictions of the two models agree , which gives us some confidence as to the realistic nature of the results .",
    "on the other hand , the results from the fundamental - measure theory ( fmt ) predict new structures , not observed in the onsager theory , which poses interesting new questions and opens up new avenues of research of course the extent to which these structures are artifacts of the zwanzig approximation or peculiarities of the particle s shape is as yet unknown .    in sec .",
    "ii we briefly remind the reader the ingredients of the two theoretical approaches .",
    "it is also devoted to present the methodology used to locate the spinodal line for c ordering in the context of the above density - functional theories . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present a few results pertaining to the eot used previously@xcite to analyze phase behavior in hspc mixtures , summarizing relevant features that appear in the phase diagrams of a few selected mixtures .",
    "complete phase diagrams , containing i , n , and s phases , are presented .",
    "our purpose is to compare the corresponding results with those obtained using the zwanzig approximation of fmt as applied to hp particles and for equivalent mixtures .",
    "density and order - parameter profiles are shown to better demonstrate the structure of the spatially ordered s phases .",
    "also , spinodal lines signaling the instability against c - type fluctuations are shown .",
    "the location of this line in connection with the stability of the s phases is discussed .",
    "we end in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] with a summary of the results and some final conclusions drawn from the comparison of the results obtained with the two theoretical approaches .",
    "in this section we use two versions of the density - functional theory , a modified onsager theory and fundamental - measure theory in the zwanzig approximation , to obtain phase diagrams of a few selected mixtures of hard rods .",

    "we are interested in locating the spinodal line corresponding to c ordering , since this is the phase that , following previous work on parallel hard rods , might become stable prior to crystallization .",

    "the stability of the nematic phase against spatial fluctuations can be assessed by examining the signs of the eigenvectors of the @xmath98 matrix , with @xmath99 here @xmath100 are fourier transforms of the direct correlation function . in practice",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "instability is signaled by one of the eigenvalues of @xmath101 or , equivalently , the determinant of @xmath101 , becoming negative .",
    "then , at fixed composition @xmath33 , we look for the value of @xmath30 for which the four equations @xmath102 are satisfied simultaneously ( @xmath103 for @xmath43 , respectively ) . in the case of the hspc model ,",
    "the c phase consists of columns of particles arranged into a two - dimensional triangular lattice perpendicular to the nematic director , and the two - dimensional ( @xmath104 plane ) perturbing wave that makes the fluid unstable will have a @xmath83 vector with non - zero @xmath33 and @xmath71 components .",
    "an instability associated with wave vectors @xmath105 , i.e. , a wave along the @xmath68 direction ( parallel to the nematic director ) , will signal instability against smectic fluctuations . for the system of hp the underlying lattice of the c phase is square , so that instability will be signaled by wave vectors @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "in the case of the fmt approximation the problem can be cast in matrix form by introducing the fluctuation @xmath108 we remark that in this case the decoupling approximation is not invoked , so the coupling between positional and orientational degrees of freedom , assumed in the implementation of the theory , is maintained .",
    "the parameters @xmath109 are taken to be arbitrary , as it corresponds to a general fluctuation .",
    "in particular , they are all taken to be independent , which is equivalent to saying that the values of the order parameters @xmath62 are allowed to vary as the perturbation is applied , in contrast with the method used in the onsager model .",
    "this is done for the sake of convenience , and has no practical importance given that the condition for instability is searched for in the space @xmath110 , and the order parameters depend on the mean density @xmath30 .",

    "explicit expressions for this function will be presented in the appendix .",
    "although the hsp and hp models are geometrically different ( hsp particles have a semispherical cap which is absent in hp particles , and their sections are circular and square , respectively ) , and their theoretical treatment is quite different , the corresponding phase diagrams will be compared in this section , in the hope that we can extract some useful information about their actual phase behavior .",
    "this comparison can be made provided we use comparable aspect ratios @xmath114 ; we should take into account the relation @xmath115      before showing the results for mixtures , and in order to have a feeling as to how the two theoretical models can be compared and how definite predictions can be drawn from this comparison , it is convenient to recall the results obtained for the corresponding one - component systems using the same theoretical models that will be used later for mixtures .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , both in the packing fraction - aspect ratio plane ( we should remind the definitions of the corresponding aspect ratios , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively ) .",
    "a quick comparison of the two phase diagrams indicates that the in phase transition is qualitatively similar : it is of first order and , for decreasing aspect ratio , ends at some value of @xmath118 , below which the n phase ceases to be stable and is superseded by the spatially ordered s phase or other more ordered phases . for hp particles the phase diagram has been analyzed in some detail using the fmt approach@xcite ( see fig .",

    "the ns transition shows a negative slope , compared with the positive slope obtained in the fmt ( at least in the range @xmath120 ) , and it is of first order up to some value of @xmath118 , above which it becomes second order .",
    "by contrast , the ns transition in the fmt approach is always of second order .",
    "since neither the crystalline nor the plastic - solid phases have been explored in the eot model ( mainly due to the fact that this model is not expected , by construction , to provide good results for phases with full spatial order ) the comparison of the phase diagrams can not be extended beyond the liquid - crystalline phases .",
    "this is not a limitation for our present purposes , since we would like to focus our investigation on these phases .",
    "however , simulations on hspc indicate that at high packing fractions there appears a solid phase with full order , which becomes a plastic solid when the aspect ratio is low . a more elaborate theory ( such as that due to somoza and tarazona@xcite )",
    "should be used to address this question .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the results as obtained from the onsager theory ( this phase diagram has already been presented in ref .",
    "the most representative feature of this phase diagram is the strong segregation of the s phase , which largely preempts the i - n transition .",
    "two s phases appear : the standard s phase , with identical smectic layers , and the s@xmath125 phase , where layers of different compositions alternate : this is a microsegregated phase .",
    "this phase is characterized by the two variational parameters @xmath26 having different signs , which implies the density distributions of the two species being shifted one with respect to the other by half a smectic period . below a reduced pressure",
    "@xmath126 there is direct coexistence between the s and i phases , which ends in a s - n - i triple point . above this pressure",
    "the s phase coexists with the s@xmath125 phase . the zwanzig model for a comparable mixture",
    "is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "note that the pressure scale is very much reduced with respect to that from the onsager theory , so that a good reference to compare the two phase diagrams is the location of the i - n transition , which is qualitatively similar to the previous case . in the zwanzig model s segregation",
    "appears at a much higher pressure , and does not preempt the i - n transition .",
    "there is no direct s - i transition , which is superseded by continuous s - n transitions , and at high pressure there appears a first - order transition between the standard s phase and the two - layer smectic phase s@xmath125 , the latter appearing when the short - particle component is more abundant ; this is in agreement with the predictions based on the onsager model .",
    "however , an important difference is that the s and s@xmath125 phases undergo continuous phase transitions to the n phase , a feature that is absent in the onsager model .",
    "this is to be expected since in the one - component hp fluid the n - s transition is always of second order . also , in a model with restricted orientations the s phase is largely destabilized with respect to the n phase , so that the region where the n phase is stable is considerably larger in the zwanzig model than predicted by the eot .",
    "in addition , the fmt approach predicts also a continuous transition between the s and s@xmath125 phases in the region where most of the particles correspond to the shorter component .",
    "this feature is absent in the eot approximation .    in order to understand the structure of the s phases in more detail ,",
    "it is interesting to examine the density and order - parameter profiles along one smectic period @xmath22 ( some of these profiles were shown in ref . 4 for the eot model , so here we will only show the profiles corresponding to the fmt approach ) .",

    "an interesting point to mention is that the position of the short particles is delocalized over the length of the long particles as can be seen from fig . [",
    "fig6](a ) .",
    "by contrast , in the s@xmath125 phase , these maxima are shifted by half a period ( an amount equal to @xmath128 ) , so that the layers with different compositions alternate .",

    "most of the particles in the system are short , and the few long particles present are evenly distributed among the layers and the interstitials .",
    "this corresponds to the second - fourier coefficient @xmath129 of the density distribution of the long particles becoming zero at this state point .",
    "as @xmath33 is reduced long particles tend to predominantly populate the insterstitials , defining a bilayer structure . on the contrary , as @xmath33 is increased , the long particles tend to arrange into the layers formed by the particles of the other component .",
    "this behavior is at variance with the predictions of the eot approach , which imply that long particles added to a smectic phase made up of the short particles tend to populate the interstitials , regardless of their concentration . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the density profiles of each species along a direction parallel to the director are also plotted with dotted lines .",
    "these profiles indicate that particles in the layers are mostly directed along the layer normal , whereas short particles tend to align in - plane in the interstitials , and a small amount of long particles also adopt this orientation .",
    "as can readily be seen , the order - parameter profile also supports this conclusion .",
    "an interesting feature of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is that , for a large concentration of short particles , there is a small region where a discotic - smectic ( ds ) phase is stable ( see fig .",

    "the present result for the mixture indicates that as soon as a small amount of long rods is added to the pure fluid , the ds phase becomes very rapidly unstable .",
    "as an example of another mixture showing strong smectic segregation , but with one species composed on nonmesogenic particles , we discuss the cases @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath122 , i.e. , mixtures of hspc with hard spheres or hp with hard cubes ( see figs . [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] ) . here",
    "again the two models give the same phase behavior : at high volume fractions of the nonmesogenic component we find an isotropic phase , and a relatively small addition of this component to a fluid composed mainly of long particles destabilizes both liquid - crystalline phases .",
    "again the n - s phase is of first order in the onsager model but of second order in the zwanzig theory .",
    "apart from that , the two phase diagrams are qualitatively similar .",
    "the structure of the smectic phase is interesting , as it is again a clear example of a microsegregated phase : layers rich in long particles alternate with layers made up of ( almost exclusively ) hard spheres ( or hard cubes , as the case may be ) . figures [ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] , containing density profiles , show this feature for the zwanzig model ( in the case of the eot the segregation into well - defined layers is even more pronounced @xcite ) .",
    "both models predict that the smectic phase is destabilized with respect to the nematic phase as the nonmesogenic component is added@xcite ( the slope of the n  s@xmath125 phase boundary in the pressure  composition plane is positive ) .    as a final mixture we have studied , using only the zwanzig approximation , the case where the parallelepipeds and the cubes have the same volumes but different breadths , i.e. , different cross sections .",
    "the phase diagram corresponding to the case @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] . due to the different cross - sectional areas of the particles the smectic phases strongly segregate at high pressures .",
    "the in segregation region is also greatly enhanced .",
    "a remarkable feature of the phase diagram is the existence of demixing in the region where the s@xmath125 phase is stable at low compositions ; this phase transition ends in a lower critical point and , at some higher pressure , transforms into a triple point where the two bilayer smectic phases with moderate content of cubes coexist with a third one which is mainly formed by cubes .",
    "the density profiles in figs . [ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] are useful to understand the structure of these phases . in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] the density distribution of the first two s@xmath125 phases is shown .",
    "figure [ fig14](a ) shows that there is a very strong microphase separation between the two components which therefore arrange in layers of almost pure composition .",
    "the origin of this isostructural phase separation into two bilayer structures can be understood in terms of the so - called depletion effect , which has an entropic origin : the cubes added to a pure mixture of rods in a smectic configuration arrange themselves in the interstitials between the smectic layers , and this arrangement creates an effective attraction between the layers , giving rise to a first - order `` condensation '' phase transition .",
    "the structure of the bilayer smectic phase at high pressure and with a high content of cubes is also very interesting as it illustrates another effect of the depletion interactions ; this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "the thermodynamic state corresponds to the phase that coexists at the triple point , with @xmath137 . from fig .",
    "[ fig15](a ) we can see that the cubes arrange themselves into well - defined layers ; however , the rods adopt a very different configuration since they do not occupy the instertitials between layers in a uniform manner : an excess density of rods develops right at the edges of the main distribution of cubes .",
    "this is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig15](b ) by the solid line , which in turn has been split into parallel and perpendicular components to the director ( layer normal ) to show that the rods in the excess regions are oriented approximately with equal probability with respect to the three mutual perpendicular directions .",
    "we can conclude that the cubes act as a soft wall against which rods are piledup as if adsorbed .",
    "the discussion thus far has been focused on the phase diagrams containing i , n , and s phases .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , there are strong arguments that suggest that the columnar phase might play a role in the phase stability of the mixtures of hard rods . using the methodology outlined in sec .",
    "[ columnar ] , we have calculated the spinodal line where the nematic phase becomes unstable with respect to fluctuations involving local spatial order . as implicit in the presentation of the method , our approach does restrict the search for instability to any particular structure ; usually , however , the first instability ( at the lowest mean density ) is found for fluctuations against columnar - type fluctuations ( this is signaled by a wave vector with nonvanishing @xmath33 or @xmath71 component ) , except in a few cases to be discussed below .    the spinodal line is represented in the phase diagram of fig . [ fig3 ] , corresponding to the mixture with @xmath138 , and @xmath133 , @xmath122 , as analyzed in the context of the eot approach . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "the instability occurs at relatively high pressure , which means that there is a relatively wide region of stability for the smectic phase and consequently , the predictions on smectic demixing in mixtures of hspc are plausible . however , our results indicate that the presence of smectic segregation should be taken with some caution , since it could be preempted by direct coexistence between the c and s@xmath125 phases . without a full calculation of the free energy of the c phase this question can not be settled completely . in order to discuss this point , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig3bis ] the free - energy branches @xmath38 of the n and s phases for a mixture with fixed pressure @xmath139 .",
    "the bifurcation point is indicated by a circle .",
    "starting at the bifurcation point at @xmath140 two possible free - energy branches for the c phase have been represented ( the c - phase branch will exist for values @xmath141 , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that the curve does not cross the smectic - phase branch : in this case the c phase exists as a metastable phase and the s phase is always more stable .",
    "the alternative situation is the one corresponding to the other curve , which crosses the smectic branch : now the c phase becomes more stable and coexists with the s phase .",
    "this demonstrates that the bifurcation analysis can only provide trends as to the possible stabilization of the phases and that , once a bifurcation point is shown to exist , one can not rule out any scenario .    the fmt theory on the hp mixture shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] predicts a spinodal line at low pressure , below the corresponding line associated with smectic ordering ( there is a small region , for small values of @xmath33 , where the smectic line is slightly above the columnar line which leaves a small region of smectic stability ; see figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the rich smectic phase behavior predicted by the theory is completely preempted by columnar ordering . at high composition",
    "@xmath33 the spinodal line ends in the region of ds stability ; this means that the ds phase preempts the instability of the i phase against columnar or plastic - solid fluctuations .",
    "now we come to show the results for the mixture with @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath122 .",
    "the results from the eot for the hspc model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we can see that the spinodal line shows the same trend : it increases with composition , and is located at relatively high pressure so that a wide region of smectic stability is found . by contrast , the fmt approach ( fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) again predicts a spinodal line against columnar - type fluctuations below the region of smectic stability , save for a small interval in composition at low values of @xmath33 .",
    "finally , we have also calculated the spinodal line associated with columnar fluctuations for the mixture with equal particle volumes but different cross sections , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "the results are in the same line as in the previous cases : the smectic phases are completely preempted by the instability against columnar fluctuations .",
    "note that the slope of the spinodal line changes sign at @xmath142 and then becomes a spinodal line for instability of the i phase ( @xmath143 ) against spatial fluctuations ; in this case the divergence of the structure factor occurs at the same density @xmath30 , independent of the orientation of the wave vector , @xmath105 , @xmath107 , or @xmath144 , which means that the instability could in principle be associated with the appearance of columnar , smectic , or solid order .",
    "this result is analogous to the behavior observed in one - component hard cubes @xcite for which it turns out that the smectic , columnar , and solid free - energy branches start at the same bifurcation point , the solid phase being the most stable phase .",
    "only a complete density - functional minimization could elucidate the relative stability between all these phases in the mixture .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the phase behavior of binary mixtures of hard particles having different geometries , with a view to locating the conditions under which spatially ordered phases are formed .",
    "two different theoretical , somehow complementary , approaches have been used : one based on the standard onsager theory for hard particles , the other being a fundamental - measure theory for hard parallelepipeds in the zwanzig approximation , i.e. with restricted particle orientations .",
    "it is known that the tendency of the two species to macroscopically segregate is enhanced when the aspect ratio of the particles is more dissimilar . for the more extreme cases this creates large demixing regions where smectic phases of different compositions coexist , even preempting part of the isotropic - nematic transition .",
    "even more significant , in some mixtures the smectic phase exhibits microphase segregation , where the species demix at the level of the one - dimensional smectic unit cell .",
    "microphases may undergo transitions to smectic phases with the usual homogeneous layer composition .",
    "we have demonstrated that these mixtures tend to form columnar phases , even when the cross - sectional length of the particles is unequal , regardless of their relative length . the extent to which columnar order is more or less stable than smectic order has been analyzed using bifurcation theory . in general",
    ", the bifurcation analysis of the eot model predicts that columnar order may appear ; whether or not this order preempts direct smectic - phase segregation can not be ascertained with the present methodology .",
    "however , it is clear that large regions of smectic stability still persist in the phase diagram . by contrast",
    ", the fmt approach in the zwanzig approximation predicts that smectic order is almost completely suppressed .",
    "the difference in behavior predicted can be traced back to the different treatments of orientational fluctuations ( in the latter case orientations are restricted to lie along three orthogonal directions , which enhances columnar order since the order parameter is usually very high ) .",
    "the results obtained with the two approaches probably set the limits of what should be expected in the real mixtures . in this respect , given the lack of more reliable theoretical treatments that can give more quantitative answers and the tremendous difficulties involved in making theoretical progress , one should rely on computer simulations , an approach that is feasible but unfortunately not pursued so far .",
