    "the most immediately measurable property of an exoplanet s emission is its temperature .",
    "both broadband and spectroscopic observations are fundamentally measuring the brightness temperature of the atmosphere at a given wavelength , whether directly if the planet is actually imaged , or more commonly relative to the temperature of its host star when a planet goes into eclipse .",
    "how we relate the observed brightness temperature , as a function of wavelength , to the physical properties of an exoplanet s atmosphere is the crux of atmospheric characterization .    unlike the majority of stars and brown dwarfs",
    ", the transformation between observed brightness temperature and physical properties for exoplanets is complicated by the fact that the dominant energy source in the atmosphere is usually external : irradiation from a host star .",
    "thus , while with a stellar spectrum one can usually assume that hotter temperatures imply light at those wavelengths emerges from deeper within the stellar atmosphere , for exoplanets this is not the case .",
    "for example , earth and the giant solar system planets all possess some sort of temperature inversion in their atmospheres , where the temperature begins to increase with height . for earth , this causes sharp emission features in the centers of the 9.5@xmath0 m  o@xmath4 and the 15@xmath0 m  co@xmath5 absorption bands . without an understanding of the temperature structure of the earth s atmosphere ,",
    "both these features would be difficult to interpret .",
    "understanding what determines the vertical temperature structure of exoplanets , and hot jupiters in particular , has thus been one of the major observational and theoretical tasks of the last decade . based on early observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and expectations based on the solar system planets , it was initially believed that all hot jupiters hotter than approximately 1800k should possess temperature inversions in their atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "generically , a temperature inversion requires a strong optical absorber that also increases the grayness of thermal opacities in the atmosphere and impedes cooling @xcite .",
    "observations of field brown dwarfs show clear signatures of gas - phase tio and vo in the optical  both of which meet the necessary criteria  and so these two molecules are believed to be the primary drivers of potential inversions in hot jupiters atmospheres @xcite . at the typical pressures of a hot jupiter s stratosphere ,",
    "both tio and vo become gases at approximately 1800k .",
    "however , subsequent observations have revealed no clear evidence for temperature inversions in hot jupiters with daysides cooler than 2500k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of inversions in hot jupiters led to suggestions that uv radiation from the host stars may be photodisassociating tio / vo @xcite , or that tio / vo may be condensing and settling out of the atmosphere on the dayside @xcite or the night side @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that gaseous tio / vo may still be present in hot jupiters atmospheres , but obscured by high altitude clouds .",
    "currently , there is no clear consensus to explain the lack of strong inversion signals in the surveyed hot jupiters .",
    "the observational effort to understand the temperature structure in hot jupiters atmosphere has been tremendously aided by the installation of wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the spectral resolution and precision of the wfc3 observations mean that rather than having to infer the presence of spectral features as is necessary using broadband data , the wfc3 spectra show them .",
    "this capability allowed @xcite to present the first clear detection of a temperature inversion in the ultra - hot jupiter wasp-33b .",
    "the high average brightness temperature of wasp-33b s dayside ( 3300k ) led them to suggest that tio / vo driven inversions may only be present in extremely hot giant planets , which is supported by the apparently isothermal wfc3 emission spectra measured for wasp-103b s dayside ( 2850k , * ? ? ? * ) , and wasp-12b s dayside ( 2930k , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    to further investigate the vertical temperature structure of ultra - hot jupiters ,",
    "we therefore observed two secondary eclipses of kepler-13ab @xcite using hst / wfc3 .",
    "the kepler-13 system is composed of three stars : the planet host kepler-13a , and the unresolved binary kepler-13bc , with the two components separated by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "kepler-13a and -13b are both nearly equal mass a - dwarfs , while kepler-13c is a fainter k - dwarf . the planet kepler-13ab has been observed in eclipse before , by @xcite , who measured the broadband emission spectrum in the kepler bandpass , the @xmath7-band , and the spitzer 3.6@xmath0 m  and 4.5@xmath0 m  bands .",
    "@xcite measured an average dayside brightness temperature of @xmath8k across all four bands , though the results of these observations did not clearly indicate a preferred temperature structure for kepler-13ab s dayside .",
    "we were also interested in kepler-13ab due to its relatively high mass of @xmath9@xmath10  @xcite and correspondingly high surface gravity of 3.3 times that of jupiter .",
    "recent observations of kelt-1b s emission spectrum by @xcite , which has a dayside temperature of 3150k and a surface gravity 22 times jupiter s , showed a non - inverted , monotonically decreasing temperature profile , which led those authors to suggest that surface gravity also plays a strong role in setting the vertical temperature of hot jupiters .",
    "the similar dayside temperature , but lower surface gravity , of kepler-13ab therefore presented itself as a relevant comparison object .",
    "we observed two eclipses of the kepler-13a ( koi-13 , bd+49 2629 ) planetary system , on ut 2014 april 28 and ut 2014 october 13 , using the infrared ( ir ) mode of wfc3 on the hubble space telescope .",
    "the two visits were each composed of five hst orbits . at the beginning of each visit we took a single direct image in the f126n filter to allow us to determine an initial wavelength solution before switching to the g141 grism ( 1.1@xmath0 m  to 1.7@xmath0 m  ) for the remainder of both visits . to decrease the image read - out times we used wfc3",
    "s 256@xmath11256 pixel subarray mode .",
    "despite the relative brightness of kepler-13a ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) we observed both of the eclipses in staring mode , rather than spatial scan mode .",
    "this was due to the presence of the nearly equal brightness companion star system kepler-13bc @xmath6 @xcite , or approximately 8 pixels , away from the planet - host kepler-13a .",
    "the kepler-13bc system itself is unresolved in our direct and grism images , and we intended to minimize the blending of kepler-13a and kepler-13bc by not scanning during our exposures .",
    "we oriented the detector on the sky such that kepler-13a and kepler-13bc were close to being aligned along the detector s pixel columns , perpendicular to the dispersion direction of our spectra .",
    "for the april visit , kepler-13a was above kepler-13bc , while for the october visit the spacecraft s roll was reversed .",
    "we used the spars10 and nsamp=3 readout modes , which gave us an exposure time of 7.6 seconds .",
    "the first orbit of each visit took 100 grism exposures , while the subsequent four orbits each collected 101 individual grism exposures , for a total of 504 grism exposures per visit .",
    "we began our image calibration from the flt images provided by stsci .",
    "we first flat - fielded the images using the procedure outline in section 6.2 of the axe handbook @xcite .",
    "this necessitated an initial wavelength solution for our images , which we determined using the method described in section 2.2 , but here using the flt images .",
    "we then used this wavelength solution and the flat - field coefficients given in the g141 flat - field data cube provided by stsci to determine , and apply , a flat - field correction over all of our grism images .",
    "we next defined a bad - pixel mask by manually selecting bad pixels on the flat field image , and we corrected these bad pixels on the flat - fielded images by replacing their values with the median values of the eight pixels immediately around the bad pixels .",
    "ultimately , none of the bad pixels lay within our spectroscopic extraction aperture , rendering this step largely unnecessary .    to identify and remove cosmic ray hits , we divided each image into two sections : the area around the stellar spectra , and the surrounding area dominated by the sky background . within the area around the stellar spectra , which we defined to be 140 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall and centered on the two spectral traces in the first grism image",
    ", we began our cosmic ray rejection by creating a model image by median combining the area in all of our flat - fielded and bad - pixel corrected images .",
    "we then divided each individual image by this model , and identified cosmic ray hits as anytime a pixel was more than 2.5 times higher than the median - combined model image .",
    "we replaced the pixels in the affected images with the value of that pixel in the model image .",
    "for the lower signal - to - noise background - dominated section of the image , we again created a median - combined model image from all of our flat - fielded and bad - pixel corrected images . instead of dividing each exposure by this model image , here we subtracted it  after fitting for a scaling factor to account for the changing pedestal value of the background . taking the standard deviation of each median subtracted exposure , we identified cosmic ray hits as pixels that lay more than four standard deviations above zero .",
    "again , we replaced the pixels in the affected images with the value of that pixel in the model image .    finally , we calculated and subtracted the background from each of our grism exposures . to do so , we defined two background regions across the bottom ( y - pixels 5 to 45 ) and top ( y - pixels 240 to 255 ) of each of the flat - fielded , bad - pixel and cosmic ray corrected images . using these two background stripes , we fit for the background in the central portion of each image assuming the background varied as a 2d plane , and subtracted this plane fit from each image .",
    "this process left us with flat - fielded , bad - pixel and cosmic ray corrected , background subtracted images with which we performed our spectral extraction .",
    "we used the direct image taken at the beginning of each of the visits to establish an initial wavelength solution for that visit . to do so , we used the daofind routine implemented in the photutils python package to determine the x- and y - pixel locations of kepler-13a and kepler-13bc on the detector subarray .",
    "we then used the wavelength calibration method described by @xcite with the adjusted wavelength coefficients determined by @xcite , to calculate a wavelength solution for each star . in the spectra of both kepler-13a and",
    "kepler-13bc the paschen@xmath14 line at 1.282@xmath0 m  was clearly visible , and we verified the accuracy of our initial wavelength solution using this feature in the first grism exposure of each visit .",
    "we assumed that this initial wavelength solution was accurate for the first grism exposures in each of the visits , which were taken immediately after the direct image .",
    "for each subsequent grism exposure in a visit , we used the spectral alignment method described by @xcite to estimate a wavelength shift in the spectrum along the dispersion direction .",
    "briefly , @xcite s alignment method median combines all of the unshifted out - of - eclipse 1d spectra from a visit , and uses this as a reference spectrum against which one measures the wavelength shift of an individual exposure s spectrum .",
    "we did an initial extraction of all our 1d spectra using the extraction method described in section 3 , and thus computed a master spectrum for each of the two visits .",
    "we cross - correlated this master spectrum against each exposure in the visit using a range of shifts from -10 pixels to + 10 pixels .",
    "we linearly interpolated the master spectrum and fit for a normalization constant at each of the cross - correlation steps .",
    "note that we assumed that the dispersion of the wavelength solution did not change over the course of a visit .",
    "this procedure gave us wavelength shifts for each individual exposure relative to the median combined master spectrum .",
    "based on our assumption that the wavelength solution derived from the direct image is correct for the first grism exposure in a visit , we subtracted the wavelength shift we measured for this first exposure from our cross - correlated master shifts to determine the shift of each individual exposure relative to our initial wavelength solution .",
    "as described in the introduction , both kepler-13a and kepler-13b are mid- to late - a dwarfs of nearly equal brightness .",
    "@xcite identified a third star in the kepler-13 system , which they determined to be on a 65.831 day orbit about kepler-13b and which they estimated contributes about 1% of the combined system light .",

    "@xcite subsequently collected an independent set of spectral observations , and their analysis gave effective temperatures of around 7500k , masses near 1.7@xmath25 , and radii of about 1.7@xmath28 .",
    "concurrently with @xcite s measurements , @xcite performed a bulk re - analysis of all the kepler target stars , and found that kepler-13a was 9100k , with a mass of 2.5@xmath25 , and a radius of 3@xmath28 .",
    "the lack of agreement on the temperature , mass , and radius of kepler-13a has complicated previous studies of the planetary system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to distinguish between these three sets of stellar parameters , we compared the stellar density implied by their masses and radii for kepler-13a to the stellar density measured for kepler-13a using the kepler transit light curve @xcite .",
    "the @xcite properties give a density of 0.17 g @xmath38 ( they gave no uncertainties on their mass and radius estimates ) , the @xcite properties give @xmath39 g @xmath38 , and the @xcite properties give a density of @xmath40 g @xmath38 . the kepler light curve , as measured by @xcite ,",
    "gives a density of @xmath41 g @xmath38 .    since the @xcite stellar properties are the only set that correctly reproduce the stellar density measured via the transit light curve , we adopted the @xcite stellar properties as correct , and do not consider either the @xcite or @xcite estimates in our reduction or analysis .",
    "we list the aggregate stellar properties for all three stars in table [ tab : stellarprops ]    as mentioned previously , kepler-13a is separated from kepler-13bc by @xmath6 @xcite , or approximately 8 pixels on the wfc3/ir detector .",
    "although the similar spectral types and brightness of kepler-13a and kepler-13b led us to expect that there would be relatively little wavelength - dependent dilution in our eclipse observations , we still wished to rigorously account for the effect of the added light from the wings of kepler-13bc s spectrum .",
    "to do so , we used the wayne simulator @xcite to generate artificial 2d spectra of both stellar components , using the stellar properties listed in table [ tab : stellarprops ] .",
    "we then subtracted the simulation for one member of the stellar system ( e.g. , kepler-13bc ) from our observed images to create an undiluted 2d spectrum for the remaining member ( e.g. , kepler-13a ) .",
    "wayne is a simulator for hst / wfc3 spectroscopic images , observed with any of the two infrared grisms ( g102 and g141 ) in both observing modes ( staring and spatial scanning ) .",
    "it is able to simulate a number of detector characteristics , such as the read noise , the non - linearity effect , the dark current and the wavelength - dependent flat - field , as well as positioning issues , such as horizontal and vertical shifts and scan speed variations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "a key feature in wayne is the field - dependent structure of the spectrum , as it takes into account the changes in the spectrum trace and the wavelength solution when the spectrum moves on the detector @xcite .",
    "in addition , to simulate the wavelength - dependent psf , wayne uses a linear combination of a pair of 2d gaussian distributions , which results in point sources consistent with the psf ensquared energy fraction given in the wide field camera 3 instrument handbook @xcite .    for our simulation of the kepler-13 system , we created two independent simulations , one for each component , and then combined them to a final data set .",
    "the position of the simulated spectra was based on the direct ( non - dispersed ) image of the target and the horizontal and vertical shifts that occurred during the observations . in this simulation",
    "we included the photon noise , the read noise , the wavelength - dependent flat - field and the sky background , to simulate the flt images . at the stage of the flt images ,",
    "the remaining reduction steps have already been applied and for this reason we did not include them . in another set of simulations",
    "we did not combine the two companions , and also did not include any source of noise or detector characteristics , in order to use them as models for subtracting each companion from the original frames .    as inputs for the simulations we used two synthetic spectra for kepler-13a and kepler-13bc , rotationally broadened to the measured @xmath42 of the stars ( table [ tab : stellarprops ] ) .",
    "to create each exposure , the simulator multiplies them by the sensitivity curve of the g141 grism to calculate the expected electron rate as a function of wavelength @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spectra are scaled based on a combined model for the transit and the systematics or  ramps ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 in * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 8) .",
    "finally , the electrons per wavelength channel are distributed on the detector by randomly sampling the wavelength - dependent psf described above . however , since this scaling is only approximate , in order to subtract the simulated model spectra from the real ones we fit for a scaling factor between them .",
    "the parameters used for the models are a combination of the stellar parameters listed in table [ tab : stellarprops ] and the planetary parameters listed in table [ tab : broadbandpriors ] .",
    "we extracted light curves for both kepler-13a and kepler-13bc .",
    "we followed the same procedure for both light curves ; for clarity we will describe the process in the context of kepler-13a s light curve .    for the kepler-13a light curve",
    ", we began with our subtracted images with the wayne simulation of kepler-13bc s light removed .",
    "we fit for the spectral trace of kepler-13a by fitting a gaussian profile to the spectrum along detector columns , allowing the baseline level , the profile width , and profile center to all be free parameters .",
    "we used the profile centers as the locations of the trace within each column , and fit a 9-degree polynomial to the resultant set of points to determine the y - pixel position of the trace as a function of x - pixel position .",
    "our measured trace positions , and the resulting polynomial fit , are not quite linear , as one would expect from the relations of @xcite .",
    "however the dispersion in our measured trace about a linear relation ( 0.085 pixels ) is consistent with the dispersion quoted in @xcite ( 0.08 pixels ) .",
    "0.00 in   -0.0 in    we then summed along detector columns to generate a 1d spectrum for kepler-13a using an extraction aperture centered on this polynomial fit to the spectral trace .",
    "we used an extraction aperture with a half width of 4.5 pixels about the trace location to sum each of the columns .",
    "we chose this aperture size for two reasons .",
    "first , though we were confident that our simulated spectra of kepler-13bc is effectively removing the wings of that system s light , we were concerned that the core of the spectral emission was being imperfectly subtracted .",
    "we therefore did not wish to have our extraction aperture for kepler-13a extend too close to this imperfectly subtracted core .",
    "second , we tested several aperture sizes from 3.0 to 6.0 pixels to determine the optimum aperture size and determine whether the exact choice of aperture significantly affected our final results .",
    "we did this by extracting broadband light curves over the range of aperture sizes , and fitting the eclipse using the initial nelder - mead likelihood maximization step of our fitting procedure described in section 3.3 .",
    "an aperture size of 4.5 pixels results in a fit with the highest likelihood and the lowest scatter in its residuals .",
    "we therefore chose 4.5 pixels as the optimum extraction aperture size .    with",
    "our extracted 1d spectra for each image , we used the wavelength solution for each image ( section 2.4 ) to extract a light curve within the fixed wavelength range of 1.125@xmath0 m  to 1.65@xmath0 m . for the broadband data",
    ", we summed this entire wavelength range into a single point for each exposure , while for the spectrally - resolved data we subdivided this wavelength range into 15 bins evenly spaced in wavelength .",
    "as usual with hst / wfc3 grism observations , our raw extracted photometry displayed clear correlated noise ( top panel of figure [ detrendplot ] ) .",
    "as delineated by @xcite , these are typically a long - term temporal trend over the course of several orbits , an `` l''-shaped hook during the course of an individual orbit , and quick variations within an orbit due to the spacecraft s thermal breathing .",
    "all three of these affects were present in our broadband and spectrally - resolved photometry of kepler-13a and -13bc .",
    "at this point the presence of kepler-13bc greatly simplified our measurement of kepler-13ab s eclipse , by providing a nearly equal brightness and equal color comparison light curve with which to perform differential photometry . since kepler-13c contributes a negligible amount of light to the -13bc light curve , the broadband response of kepler-13bc to the hst / wfc3 systematics closely matched the response of kepler-13a .",
    "we initially attempted to create a differential light curve for kepler-13a by the straight division of the kepler-13bc light curve , similar to how we would treat this in ground - based photometry . to our initial surprise , this gave a differential light curve for kepler-13a that displayed a much higher scatter than the raw light curve , about 700ppm versus about 450ppm , even though the systematic trends seemed to be mostly gone .",
    "upon further consideration , we realized that this was because our raw hst / wfc3 photometry  unlike ground - based photometry  was dominated by photon , rather than systematic noise .",
    "thus , while dividing the kepler-13a by the -13bc light curve removed the systematic trends , it also added the photon noise scatter of the kepler-13bc in quadrature to the photon noise scatter in kepler-13a .",
    "we therefore applied a low - pass filter to the kepler-13bc light curve , to capture the systematic trends in that system s photometry while removing most of the photon noise .",
    "specifically , we used a second - order butterworth filter with a cutoff at 0.02 days .",
    "as shown by the red line in the middle panel of figure [ detrendplot ] , the thus filtered kepler-13bc light curve appeared to correctly capture the trends that we were interested in .",
    "we then generated our differential light curve for the white light kepler-13a",
    "data by dividing the raw kepler-13a photometry by this filtered -13bc light curve .",
    "as shown in the bottom panel of figure [ detrendplot ] , this removed most of the systematics and made the broadband eclipse clearly visible during both visits .",
    "another advantage of using kepler-13bc to make a differential light curve for kepler-13a is that we were able to make effective use of the first orbit of observations in both of our visits .",
    "typically the entire first orbit of a visit is discarded for precise eclipse or transit observations , due to the increased ramp and thermal breathing affects . in our case , it is a relatively simple matter to remove most of these affects using our differential comparison .",
    "the use of the first orbit s data was particularly helpful in the april visit , as without the first orbit we would not have had any pre - eclipse baseline observations .    for the spectrally - resolved data we also created differential light curves  but instead of differencing against kepler-13bc , we differenced against kepler-13a itself .",
    "we were motivated to do so out of a concern that the different placement of the two stars on the detector , plus their slightly different intrinsic spectra , would generate spurious spectral signatures if we differenced against kepler-13bc .",
    "we applied the same low - pass filter as we used in the broadband data to the broadband kepler-13a photometry , and divided each of our spectrally - resolved light curves by this filtered broadband photometry .    in our spectrally - resolved data",
    "we therefore did not measure the absolute eclipse of kepler-13ab , but rather the change in eclipse depth as a function of wavelength .    in both the broadband and spectrally - resolved differential light curves",
    "there was residual systematic noise .",
    "we chose to fit these residual correlations using a gaussian process ( gp ) regression model , as the traditional parametric methods for dealing with hst / wfc3 systematics were not applicable to our differential light curves .    a gp regression models the observed data as random draws from a multivariate gaussian distribution about some mean function .",
    "as a result , gps are able to directly model the possible covariances between data points by populating the non - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix which defines the multivariate gaussian distribution .",
    "this is in contrast , for example , to a @xmath46 fitting process , which models the data as random draws from a univariate gaussian distribution and assumes no covariance between data points  aside from what is inserted via detrending functions . for more detail , @xcite provide a thorough mathematical overview of gp methods .",

    "but due to the propinquity of kepler-13a , the dayside of the planet appears to be closer in temperature to a mid to late m - dwarf .",
    "we therefore compared our emission spectrum to a series of spectral templates from the spex library covering m4 to t9 spectra for field objects , and a set of low - gravity templates covering m5 to t9 from @xcite .",

    "since isolated brown dwarfs are primarily heated from within , and have correspondingly monotonically decreasing atmospheric temperature - pressure profiles , this strengthens our conclusion from the atmospheric models that kepler-13ab s dayside is neither isothermal , nor does it possess a stratospheric temperature inversion .",

    "@xcite measured a center time for kepler-13ab s eclipse that was very close to being half of an orbital period away from the transit center time , with a displacement of @xmath134s . as they noted , due to the light travel time across the diameter of kepler-13ab s orbit , for a perfectly circular orbit one would expect the eclipse time to actually be delayed by @xmath135s .",
    "the apparent earliness of the eclipse implies a slightly eccentric orbit , and is what drives the non - zero value of @xmath64 listed in table [ tab : broadbandpriors ] .",
    "as described in section 3.1.1 , we used the predicted eclipse time from @xcite as a prior on our broadband fitting process .",
    "since our observations poorly sample the predicted eclipse ingress and egress ( i.e. , figure [ niceplot ] ) , this prior on @xmath62 dominates in our fits and we simply recover it in the posterior distribution for @xmath62 from our mcmc fitting . in our adopted fit , we therefore find that the eclipse center time is @xmath136s earlier than the transit center time plus exactly half the orbital period , which as we expected is effectively identical to the value measured by @xcite .    to determine how well our hst / wfc3 can independently constrain the eclipse center time , we conducted an additional broadband fit using no prior on the eclipse center .",
    "this gave @xmath137 , which is @xmath138s earlier than the transit center time plus exactly half the orbital period .",
    "the large uncertainties on this timing offset make it consistent with the expectations from both @xcite and the perfectly circular case , so our observations are not able to meaningfully determine the eccentricity of kepler-13ab s orbit .",
    "one complication in interpreting the optical eclipse depth for kepler-13ab is the relatively high amount of reflected light expected from the planet . specifically , the eclipse depth from reflected light alone should be @xmath139ppm , where @xmath140 is the spherical albedo of the dayside at a particular wavelength . since the kepler - band eclipse measured by @xcite is @xmath141ppm , it is possible  though unlikely  that the optical eclipse is entirely due to reflected light . for our nir observations , the theoretical expectation is that hot jupiters at @xmath142k should have dayside geometric albedos of effectively zero at these wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we therefore did not consider possible signatures of reflected light in our wfc3 spectra , and excluded the kepler eclipse point from our evaluation of our thermal emission models .",
    "based on those thermal emission models that assume the wfc3 and further nir data contain no reflected light , we calculate that kepler-13ab should have an eclipse 143ppm deep in the kepler bandpass .",
    "the difference between this prediction for the thermal emission and the observed depth of @xmath141ppm implies that kepler-13ab has a spherical albedo of @xmath143 in the kepler bandpass .",
    "this is substantially lower than the value found by @xcite , @xmath144 , almost entirely because our models of the planetary thermal emission are higher in the optical .",
    "our measured geometric albedo and the expectations from @xcite are thus both consistent with our assumption that the wfc3 and other nir eclipse depths contain no substantial components from reflected light .",
    "this is in line with what one would expect from other measurements of hot jupiters eclipses , most of which have @xmath145 in the kepler bandpass @xcite .",
    "note , though , that the unknown thermal emission components , and the lower stellar insolation in the @xcite sample make this only a general comparison . indeed , the high stellar insolation that kepler-13ab receives makes it possible that kepler-13ab may have different reflective properties compared to these cooler planets .",
    "one way to test this would be to observe an optical eclipse spectrum for the planet . in the case that kepler-13ab has a substantial optical albedo , the optical eclipse spectrum would be a combination of the reflectance spectrum ( expected to increase towards the blue , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the thermal emission spectrum ( expected to decrease towards the blue ) , which would make the observed eclipse spectrum relatively flat .      as described in the introduction , the lack of clear stratospheric temperature inversions for planets cooler than approximately 3000k led @xcite to recently suggest that that tio / vo driven inversions may only be present in the atmospheres of extremely hot giant planets .",
    "@xcite s spectrally - resolved observations of the @xmath146-band eclipse of the transiting brown dwarf kelt-1b ( 3200k ) showed a monotonically decreasing tp profile . due to the high surface gravity of kelt-1b ( 22 times that of jupiter ) , this led them to suggest that surface gravity also plays a role in the presence of a thermal inversion in hot jupiters .",
    "specifically , they argued that this was evidence for the cold - trap methods of sequestering tio / vo described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , both @xcite and @xcite describe a process of tio / vo gas particles condensing and gravitationally settling out of the upper atmosphere .",
    "@xcite envisioned this as a `` vertical '' cold - trap , where tio / vo gas on the dayside of a hot jupiter randomly crosses the condensation boundary in the atmosphere , condenses , and falls into the planetary interior .",
    "@xcite considered a `` day - night '' cold - trap , where tio / vo molecules condense on the cooler night side of a hot jupiter , and also settle into the interior . in both cases the efficiency of a cold - trap is determined by the interplay of the rate of gravitational settling and the strength of some vertical lofting mechanism to bring tio / vo condensates back into the upper atmosphere where they can re - vaporize .",
    "both analyses found that under reasonable assumptions these two cold - traps should be able to deplete a hot jupiter s stratosphere of gas - phase tio / vo .    in the cases of both kepler-13ab and kelt-1b , the dayside temperature profiles both remain too hot at depth to allow for a vertical cold - trap to exist .",
    "down to pressures of @xmath147 bar , at no point do either of these profiles cross cooler than the tio or vo condensation curves , which vary between approximately 2200k at @xmath147 bar down to approximately 1600k at @xmath148 bar .",
    "the most recent modeling of such a process was done by @xcite , who found that a vertical cold - trap of tio / vo was mostly effective in planets with equilibrium temperatures less than 1900k , which is several hundred degrees cooler than the planets we consider .",
    "if a cold - trap process is occurring in these atmospheres - and in the atmospheres of the other extremely hot giant planets - it is very probably caused by a day - night cold - trap .",
    "to first order , the rate of gravitational settling in a hot jupiter s atmosphere will be given by the free - fall timescale within that atmosphere .",
    "this will be the scale height of the atmosphere divided by the free - fall terminal velocity of condensates , @xmath149 here @xmath150 is the atmospheric temperature , @xmath151 is the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere , @xmath152 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath153 is the particle radius , @xmath154 is the particle density , @xmath155 is the atmospheric density , and @xmath156 is the viscosity of the gas .",
    "if we make the assumption that mean molecular weight and viscosity of hot jupiters atmospheres , as well as the condensate and atmospheric density , are all effectively the same , then the free - fall timescale goes as @xmath157    typically , turbulent diffusion is treated as the dominant vertical lofting mechanism for condensates in the upper portion of a hot jupiter s atmosphere , but the exact efficiency of this process is poorly understood . by analogy to molecular diffusion",

    "<S> we observed two eclipses of the kepler-13a planetary system , on ut 2014 april 28 and ut 2014 october 13 , in the near - infrared using wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope . by using the nearby binary stars </S>",
    "<S> kepler-13bc as a reference , we were able to create a differential light curve for kepler-13a that had little of the systematics typically present in hst / wfc3 spectrophotometry . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a broadband ( 1.1@xmath0 m  to 1.65@xmath0 m ) eclipse depth of @xmath1ppm , and are able to measure the emission spectrum of the planet at @xmath2 with an average precision of 70ppm . </S>",
    "<S> our observations do not well sample either the eclipse ingress or egress , and so we are not able to provide meaningful constraints on the eclipse timing offset observed by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we do find that our observations , combined with those of @xcite give an average dayside brightness temperature of 3000k , and are consistent with a non - inverted , monotonically decreasing vertical temperature profile at 2.4@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we exclude an isothermal profile and an inverted profile . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the dayside emission of kepler-13ab appears generally similar to an isolated m7 brown dwarf at a similar effective temperature . due to the relatively high mass and surface gravity of kepler-13ab </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the apparent lack of an inversion is due to cold - trap processes in the planet s atmosphere . using a toy - model for where cold - traps should inhibit inversions , and observations of other planets in this temperature range with measured emission spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that with more detailed modeling and more observations we may be able to place useful constraints on the size of condensates on the daysides of hot jupiters . </S>"
