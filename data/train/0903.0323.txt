    "<S> by using solid state reaction method , we have synthesized the pd - doped superconductor srfe@xmath0pd@xmath1as@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic evolution of the lattice constants indicated that the fe ions were successfully replaced by the pd . by increasing the doping content of pd , the antiferromagnetic order of the parent phase is suppressed and superconductivity is induced at a doping level of about x=0.05 . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity with a maximum transition temperature t@xmath3 of about 8.7 k was achieved at a doping level of x = 0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> the general phase diagram of t@xmath3 versus x was obtained and found to be similar to the case of ni and co doping to the fe sites . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that superconductivity can be easily induced in the feas family by adding charges into the system , regardless with the transition metals of 3d or higher d - orbital electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity in the feas - based systems has received tremendous attention since last year with the hope that the superconducting transition temperature could be raised to a higher value@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting transition temperature was promoted above 50 k by replacing lanthanum with other rare - earth elements in lafeaso@xcite , or by substituting the alkaline elements with rare earth elements in ( ba , sr , ca)feasf@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the hole - doped superconductors were discovered both in the feas-1111 and the feas-122 family@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the feas-122 phase , due to the much simpler structure , less elements in the compound and easy growth of large scale single crystals , provides us a great opportunity to investigate the intrinsic physical properties@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , people found that a substitution of fe ions with co or ni can also induce superconductivity with the maximum t@xmath3 above 20 k@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these early experiments were focused on the substitution of fe ions with 3d - transition metals nearby fe . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , ru and ir substitution at fe sites in the feas-122 phase has also been shown to exhibit superconductivity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it seems intriguing to know whether it is possible to induce superconductivity by substituting fe ions with other transition metals , such as pd which locates just below ni in the periodic table of elements . in this paper , we report the successful fabrication of new superconductors in srfe@xmath0pd@xmath4as@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction pattern ( xrd ) , resistivity , dc magnetic susceptibility , upper critical field as well as the phase diagram have been determined in the system of srfe@xmath0pd@xmath4as@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we employed a two - step solid state reaction method to synthesize the srfe@xmath0pd@xmath4as@xmath5 samples . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , sras , feas powders were obtained by the chemical reaction method with sr pieces , fe powders ( purity 99.99% ) , and as grains . </S>",
    "<S> then they were mixed together in the formula srfe@xmath0pd@xmath4as@xmath5 , ground and pressed into a pellet shape . </S>",
    "<S> all the weighing , mixing and pressing procedures were performed in a glove box with a protective argon atmosphere ( both h@xmath2o and o@xmath2 are limited below 0.1 ppm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pellet was sealed in a silica tube with 0.2 bar of ar gas and followed by heat treatment at 900 @xmath6c for 50 hours </S>",
    "<S> . then it was cooled down slowly to room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a repeating of above procedures improves the purity of the samples .    </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray diffraction measurement was performed at room temperature using an mxp18a - hf - type diffractometer with cu - k@xmath7 radiation from 10@xmath8 to 80@xmath8 with a step of 0.01@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of x - ray powder diffraction data was done by using the software of powder - x,@xcite and the lattice constants were derived by having a general fitting ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dc magnetization measurements were done with a superconducting quantum interference device ( quantum design , squid , mpms7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the zero - field - cooled magnetization was measured by cooling the sample at zero field to 2 k , then a magnetic field was applied and the data were collected during the warming up process . </S>",
    "<S> the field - cooled magnetization data was collected in the warming up process after the sample was cooled down to 2 k at a finite magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity measurements were done with a physical property measurement system ppms-9 t ( quantum design ) with the four - probe technique . </S>",
    "<S> the current direction was changed for measuring each point in order to remove the contacting thermal power .    </S>",

    "<S> the asterisks mark the peaks arising from the impurity phase . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]        in order to have a comprehensive understanding to the evolution induced by the doping effect , we have measured the x - ray diffraction patterns for all samples . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice constants of a - axis and c - axis are thus obtained . in figure 1 , we present the x - ray diffraction patterns of srfe@xmath0pd@xmath4as@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that all main peaks of the samples can be indexed to a tetragonal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks marked with asterisks arise from the impurity phase . by fitting the data to the structure calculated with the software powder - x </S>",
    "<S> , we get the lattice constants . in figure 2 , we show a- and c- lattice parameters for the srfe@xmath0pd@xmath4as@xmath5 samples . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that , by substituting the pd into the fe site , the lattice constant @xmath9 shrinks a bit , while @xmath10 expands slightly . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency is similar to the case of doping the fe with ir or ru in srfe@xmath0ir@xmath4as@xmath5 and bafe@xmath0ru@xmath4as@xmath5.@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> as we can see , the parent phase exhibits a sharp drop of resistivity ( resistivity anomaly ) at about 215 k. by doping more pd , the resistivity drop was converted to an uprising . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs also in the co - doped samples . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the superconductivity appears in the sample with nominal composition of x = 0.1 . </S>",
    "<S> in the sample of x = 0.15 , the resistivity anomaly disappeared completely . </S>",
    "<S> this sample shows a superconducting transition at about 8.7 k which is determined by a standard method , i.e. , using the crossing point of the normal state background and the extrapolation of the transition part with the most steep slope ( as shown by the dashed lines in fig.6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the transition width determined here with the criterion of 10 - 90 @xmath11 @xmath12 is about 1.2 k. with higher doping level ( x = 0.2 ) the transition temperature declines slightly . </S>",

    "<S> the measurement was done under a magnetic field of 20 oe in zero - field - cooled and field - cooled modes . </S>",
    "<S> a strong meissner shielding signal was observed.,width=302 ]    in figure 4 , the temperature dependence of the dc magnetization for the sample srfe@xmath14pd@xmath13as@xmath5 was shown . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement was carried out under a magnetic field of 20 oe in zero - field - cooled and field - cooled processes . </S>",
    "<S> a clear diamagnetic signal appears below 8.2@xmath15k , which corresponds to the middle transition temperature of the resistivity data . </S>",
    "<S> a very strong meissner shielding signal was observed in the low temperature regime , which is similar to the case in srfe@xmath0ir@xmath4as@xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> pd@xmath4as@xmath5 within the range of x = 0 to 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of resistivity anomaly represents the upturning point of resistivity which indicates a deviating point from a rough t - linear behavior in the high temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity starts to appear at x > 0.05 , reaching a maximum t@xmath3 of 8.7 k at x = 0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line provides a guide to the eyes for the possible af order / strctural transitions near the optimal doping level.,width=302 ]    in figure 5 , a phase diagram of srfe@xmath0pd@xmath4as@xmath5 within the range of x from 0 to 0.25 was given . both t@xmath16 and </S>",
    "<S> t@xmath17 was defined as temperature of the anomaly in resistivity and the superconductivity transition by resistivity and susceptibility , respectively . like other samples in feas-122 phase , with increasing pd - doping , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the resistivity anomaly which may correspond the tetragonal - orthorhombic structural / antiferromagnetic transition is driven down , and the superconductivity emerges at x = 0.1 , reaching a maximum t@xmath3 of 8.7 k at x=0.15 . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting state disappeared at x = 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see , there exists a region in which the antiferromagnetic and superconductivity coexist . </S>",
    "<S> this general phase diagram looks very similar to that with ni - doping.@xcite since pd locates just below ni in the periodic table of elements , we would conclude that the superconductivity induced by pd doping shares the similarity as that of ni doping . </S>",
    "<S> further measurements on other properties will clarify this point .    </S>",
    "<S> pd@xmath13as@xmath5 at different magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line indicates the extrapolated resistivity in the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the superconductivity seems to be robust against the magnetic field and shifts slowly to the lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the inset gives the upper critical field determined using the criterion of 90%@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> a slope of -dh@xmath18/dt = 4.2 t / k near t@xmath3 is found here . </S>",
    "<S> the irreversibility line h@xmath19 taking with the criterion of 0.1% @xmath12 is also presented in the inset.,width=302 ]    in figure 6 we present the temperature dependence of resistivity broadening induced by using different magnetic fields . just as many other iron pnictide superconductors , the superconductivity is also very robust against the magnetic field in the present sample although the t@xmath3 is only 8.7 k. we used the criterion of @xmath20 to determine the upper critical field and show the data in the inset of figure 6 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , regarding the relatively low t@xmath3 , a high slope of -dh@xmath18/dt = 4.2 </S>",
    "<S> t / k can be obtained here . by using the werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) formula@xcite @xmath21 , the value of zero temperature upper critical field can be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath22k , we get @xmath23 roughly . </S>",
    "<S> because of the low superconducting transition temperature , the present pd - doped sample has a smaller upper critical field , compared with k - doped@xcite and co - doped samples@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity mechanism in the feas - based superconductors remains unclear yet . </S>",
    "<S> one widely perceived picture is that the pairing is established via the inter - pocket scattering of electrons through exchanging the af spin fluctuations.@xcite by doping electrons or holes into the parent phase , the condition for forming the af order will be destroyed gradually . instead the short range af order will provide a wide spectrum of spin fluctuations which may play as the media for the pairing between electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this picture can certainly give a qualitative explanation to the occurrence of superconductivity here . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still unclear why the superconducting transition temperature varies in doping different elements . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the maximum t@xmath3 by doping co , ni , ru or ir can be as high as 24 - 26 k,@xcite , while that by doping pd in the present case is only about 8.7 k. in addition , in most cases , the substitution to the fe sites by other transition metal elements in the 1111 phase gives only a rather low superconducting transition temperature compared to the 122 phase . </S>",
    "<S> this puzzling point certainly warrants further investigations . </S>",
    "<S> our data here further illustrate that the superconductivity can be easily induced by doping the fe sites with many other transition metals which are not restricted to the ones with 3d orbital electrons .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , superconductivity has been found in srfe@xmath24pd@xmath4as@xmath2 with the maximum t@xmath3 = 8.7 k. the phase diagram obtained is quite similar to that by doping co , ni , ru or ir to the fe sites . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity is rather robust against the magnetic field with a slope of -dh@xmath18/dt = 4.2 </S>",
    "<S> t / k near t@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our results clearly indicate that the superconductivity can be easily induced in ( ba , sr)fe@xmath2as@xmath2 by replacing the fe sites with many different transition metal elements which can be those with 4d- or 5d - orbital electrons .    </S>",
