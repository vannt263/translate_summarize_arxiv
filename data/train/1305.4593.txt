    "one of the key aspects of superconductivity is the fermionic nature of the superconducting wave function , or equivalently the pair amplitude .",
    "this leads to the traditional classification into spin - singlet even - parity ( @xmath0- , @xmath1-wave ) or spin - triplet odd - parity ( @xmath2-wave ) pairing .",
    "as berezinskii @xcite originally showed , superconducting pairing can also be odd in time , or equivalently frequency . while theoretical proposals exist for odd - frequency bulk superconductors,@xcite odd - frequency pair amplitudes",
    "have so far only been argued to have been found in non - uniform systems , such as at surfaces and interfaces .",
    "@xcite for example , at superconductor - ferromagnetic interfaces a conventional spin - singlet @xmath0-wave superconducting pair amplitude is transformed into an odd - frequency spin - triplet @xmath0-wave amplitude , due to spin - rotational symmetry breaking.@xcite the spin - triplet nature gives rise to long - range proximity effect into the ferromagnet .",
    "also non - magnetic interfaces induce odd - frequency components , where instead translational symmetry breaking transforms a spin - singlet @xmath0-wave state into an odd - frequency spin - singlet @xmath2-wave state.@xcite the @xmath2-wave nature , however , makes this odd - frequency component sensitive to disorder.@xcite    numerous recently discovered superconductors have multiple bands at the fermi level .",
    "these include both the unconventional iron - pnictides / chalcogens,@xcite heavy fermion superconductors,@xcite and mgb@xmath3 , a two - band phonon - driven superconductor.@xcite in these multi - band superconductors the band - index provides yet another symmetry index for the pair amplitude .",
    "while intraband pairing is , per definition , always an even function in band - index , both even- and odd - interband pairing are , in general , also possible .    in this work",
    "we show that odd - frequency pairing is ubiquitous in multi - band superconductors . by transforming between even- and odd - interband pairing ,",
    "odd - frequency correlations are induced in the bulk of the superconductor , because the necessary symmetry breaking is , in general , present intrinsically in these systems .",
    "more specifically , we show that finite odd - frequency odd - interband pairing appears whenever there is a finite even - interband pairing between two non - identical bands .",
    "this is , for example , always the case when scattering , or hybridization , is present between two bands with non - identical intraband order parameters ( of which one can be zero ) .",
    "formally , we find that the orbital , or band , parity ( o ) of the pair amplitude in multi - band superconductors , together with spatial parity ( p ) and time reversal ( t ) , needs to obey the rule @xmath4 for spin - singlet ( spin - triplet ) pairing .",
    "there is thus a complete reciprocity between pairing that is odd in frequency and odd under band / orbital index permutation .",
    "we start by establishing the formal possibility of odd - frequency pairing in multi - band superconductors .",
    "the previous classification for even / odd - frequency pairing has to be broaden when multiple bands are present , as it is now also dependent on the orbital ( band ) parity .",
    "we generalize the berezinskii approach @xcite by considering an orbital ( or band or species ) dependent two fermion condensate @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 refer to spin and orbital index , respectively .",
    "for concreteness we consider the case of two orbitals @xmath7 .",
    "we define spatial parity ( p ) as acting on the relative coordinate @xmath8 : @xmath9 , time reversal ( t ) as acting on the relative time @xmath10 : @xmath11 , and _ orbital parity _",
    "( o ) as acting on the @xmath12 index : @xmath13 . and",
    "for even - orbital ( symmetric ) projection we trace @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the vector index in the  orbital `` space '' and @xmath10 are pauli matrices operating in orbital space . ]",
    "the general symmetry requirement for a two fermion condensate can then be written as @xmath16 for spin - singlet @xmath17 we further project to spin - singlet and find @xmath18 which we shorthand as @xmath19 , namely , the simultaneous inversion of space , time , and permutation of orbital index will leave a spin - singlet pairing order parameter invariant . for the spin - triplet case ( @xmath20 now is a vector in spin space ) a similar analysis leads to @xmath21 which we shorthand as @xmath22 .",

    "the results in table [ tab ] provide the formal evidence of odd - frequency pairing in multi - band superconductors by changing the orbital ( band ) parity . in order to show that odd - frequency pairing is also extremely common in multi - band superconductors we start with a generic two - band superconductor : @xmath26 here",
    "@xmath27 creates an electron in band @xmath12 with momentum @xmath28 and spin @xmath29 , and similarly for band @xmath30 .",
    "the kinetic energy is given by the band dispersions @xmath31 and a single - particle band scattering , or hybridization , @xmath32 .",
    "a finite @xmath32 appears automatically if the superconducting pairing occurs in ( atomic or molecular ) orbitals in which the kinetic energy is not fully diagonal,@xcite as e.g.  proposed for the iron - pnictide superconductors.@xcite it can also e.g.  result from disorder - induced interband scattering .",
    "the superconducting intraband ( diagonal ) order parameters are @xmath33 .",
    "we will here assume conventional spin - singlet , uniform @xmath0-wave superconducting states , but the results apply equally well to any intraband pairing .",
    "for finite @xmath32 we diagonalize the kinetic energy , resulting in a hamiltonian with fully diagonal bands @xmath34 and @xmath1 , but now with both intraband superconducting order parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 and an even - interband order parameter @xmath37 : @xmath38 if we write @xmath39 , we can express @xmath40 .",
    "thus , even - interband pairing is always present whenever @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the original hamiltonian @xmath43 . with the discovery of several multi - band superconductors ,",
    "intrinsic even - interband pairing has also been studied in many systems.@xcite in this case the need to start with a finite band hybridization @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hab ] ) is automatically circumvent .",
    "we are here primarily interested in the @xmath0-wave time - ordered pairing amplitude : @xmath44 which is an even ( @xmath24 ) or odd ( @xmath25 ) function in band index .",
    "@xmath45 is the number of points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "@xmath46 can also be either even or odd in the time coordinate .",
    "the even - frequency pair amplitude we define , as usual , by the equal - time amplitude , such that the even - frequency even - interband spin - singlet @xmath0-wave amplitude is @xmath47 .",
    "the superconducting even - interband order parameter is thus @xmath48 , for some effective interband pairing potential @xmath49 . since @xmath37 is an even function in band - index , the odd interband combination @xmath50 . for the component odd in time",
    ", we can still define an equal - time order parameter if we use the time derivative at equal times:@xcite @xmath51 .",
    "odd - frequency pairing is necessarily accompanied by an oddness in band index for spin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairing .    to continue , we first focus on the interband pairing in @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcd ] ) , setting @xmath53 .",
    "formally this can be achieved by choosing @xmath54 and @xmath55 . by using the time - dependence @xmath56 of the @xmath57th bogoliubov quasiparticle , with @xmath58 being its eigenenergy , we find @xmath59 } { \\eta\\left [ \\cosh(\\frac{\\varepsilon_c-\\varepsilon_d}{2 { k_bt } } ) + \\cosh(\\frac{\\eta}{2{k_bt}})\\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 . for odd - frequency pairing to appear @xmath61 is necessary , which is true for finite @xmath32 .",
    "further , when @xmath62 and @xmath63 we get @xmath64 , whereas if @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "odd - frequency odd - interband pairing is thus always present in a superconductor with even - interband pairing and non - identical bands .",
    "if there is no intrinsic even - interband pairing present , odd - frequency pairing will still always exist in a two - band superconductor with finite band hybridization @xmath32 and different intraband order parameters .",
    "the overall factor of @xmath67 in eq .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : fwo ] ) ignored intraband pairing .",

    "let us first study the special case @xmath74 , which explicitly illustrates the deep connection between @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then the diagonal band dispersions @xmath77 , intraband pairing @xmath78 , and interband pairing @xmath79 .",
    "if we further assume @xmath80 , the even - interband pairing amplitude is the bcs gap equation : @xmath81 , whereas the odd - frequency odd - interband amplitude is @xmath82 .",

    "[ fig : bandhyb](a ) shows the linear dependence on @xmath32 for @xmath83 , while deviations from @xmath74 give a sublinear dependence on the band hybridization @xmath32 .",

    "[ fig : bandhyb](b ) , clearly demonstrating the robust dependence of @xmath76 on the interband pairing @xmath85 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath76 with increasing band - width ( @xmath86 ) is also a sign of its connection to the even - frequency pair amplitude .",
    "the above analytical and numerical results show that odd - frequency odd - interband pairing is extremely common in multi - band superconductors , requiring only a finite band hybridization and different intraband order parameters , as is generally always present .",
    "for example , in the presence of interband defect scattering , odd - frequency pairing should be present in the two - band superconductor mgb@xmath3,@xcite high - temperature superconducting iron - pnictides / chalcogens,@xcite as well as in superconducting heavy fermion compounds.@xcite the key to odd - frequency odd - interband pairing is the existence of even - interband pairing .",
    "interband pairing that is _ not _ an even function in band index will _ not _ have the same effect .",
    "for example , interband pairing of the form @xmath87 , which constitutes an interband _ pair _ scattering mechanism,@xcite does not induce odd - frequency pairing .",
    "the deep connection between parity in band index and frequency is further solidified if we consider the case of even - frequency odd - interband pairing , which for @xmath0-wave symmetry is necessarily a spin - triplet state . while such odd - interband pairing can not be induced by simple band hybridization ,",
    "it has been suggested for the iron - pnictides @xcite and found in the proximity - induced superconducting response in topological insulators.@xcite again , ignoring any intraband pairing @xmath88 in @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hcd ] ) and replacing the even - interband pairing @xmath37 with an odd - interband spin - triplet term we arrive at an odd - frequency even - interband spin - triplet @xmath0-wave pairing amplitude exactly equal to the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fwo ] ) . such mixing of even - frequency odd - interband and odd - frequency even - interband pairing has in fact been pointed out before for multi - pocket systems.@xcite",
    "we have so far , exclusively worked in reciprocal space , but there are many situations where multiple superconducting orbitals , or sites , within one unit cell have to be described in real space . in this case",
    "we will let the operators @xmath89 and @xmath90 represent the ( two ) different orbitals in the unit cell @xmath57 . by using @xmath91 and @xmath92 for intraorbital spin - singlet @xmath0-wave pairs ,",
    "the derivation given above is equally applicable in this real space system .",
    "thus odd - frequency odd - interorbital pairing will always be present as soon as there is a finite single - electron orbital hybridization of the form @xmath93 and non - identical intraorbital superconducting order parameters .",
    "the latter requirement can be fulfilled if the orbitals have different physical origins , but also if the orbitals are separated in space and there are atomic - scale variations in the material .",
    "a josephson junction with single - electron hybridization across the junction is a prototype example of the latter .",
    "this odd - frequency odd - interorbital pairing is very different from the odd - frequency pairing discussed earlier for josephson junctions,@xcite where a conventional spin - singlet @xmath0-wave junction generates odd - frequency spin - singlet @xmath2-wave pairing , which is not robust to disorder .",
    "another example is a superconductor / bi@xmath3se@xmath94 topological insulator heterostructure .",
    "the two active ( bi ) orbitals in bi@xmath3se@xmath94 are separated along the @xmath95-axis @xcite and will therefore experience different superconducting pairing .",
    "we recently found numerically a complete reciprocity between parity in orbital and frequency spaces in a bi@xmath3se@xmath94/superconductor heterostructure for spin - singlet @xmath0- , @xmath1-wave as well as spin - triplet @xmath2-wave superconductors.@xcite the @xmath96 symmetry requirement established above provide the analytical framework for this finding .",
    "yet another simple example of a multi - orbital system is graphene .",
    "intrinsic superconductivity has been proposed theoretically in graphene @xcite and a superconducting state has been achieved experimentally in graphene by proximity - coupling to a superconductor deposited on top of the graphene sheet.@xcite in graphene , the hybridization between the @xmath97-orbitals on the two carbon atoms equals the nearest neighbor hopping @xmath98 , and therefore overwhelmingly dominates kinetic energy .",
    "odd - frequency odd - interorbital pairing will thus be present whenever there are different superconducting intraorbital pairing order parameters @xmath33 on the two sites .",
    "since @xmath99 for some pair potential @xmath100 , and equivalently for @xmath101 , different intraorbital order parameters can be achieved by either having @xmath102 or by having different density of states at each site . such sublattice symmetry",
    "breaking effects can be present in both intrinsically superconducting graphene , due e.g.  to substrate effects , or at the graphene - superconductor interface when superconductivity is proximity - induced in the graphene . in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene ] we plot @xmath69 for both of these cases .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene](a ) the pair potential @xmath103 is changed while @xmath100 and the local chemical potentials @xmath104 are kept fixed .",
    "the odd - frequency response is always zero for @xmath105 and is larger for higher chemical potentials , since larger density of states at the fermi level cause larger even - interorbital pairing . in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene](b ) we instead set @xmath106 but vary the chemical potential difference between the two sites .",
    "@xmath107 is zero when there is no asymmetry between the two sites , i.e.  @xmath104 , but is in general otherwise finite .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphene ] show that odd - frequency pairing is present as soon as there is sublattice symmetry breaking , which in graphene can e.g.  be achieved by substrate or interface effects.@xcite while we have here used graphene as a simple example , odd - frequency odd - interorbital pairing will be present in any non - bravais lattice with a site - dependent superconducting state . for these systems",
    "it is the sublattice symmetry breaking that facilitates the creation of odd - frequency pairing .",
    "odd - frequency superconducting pairing has in the past often been associated with the appearance of sub - gap states,@xcite or even a low - energy continuum.@xcite however , for odd - frequency odd - interband pairing , we do _ not _ in general find any low - energy states .",
    "for the special case studied analytically above , i.e.  eq .  ( [ eq : hcd ] ) with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , we find the eigen energies @xmath110 , and thus zero energy states for @xmath111 .",
    "however , there is no stable superconducting state for @xmath111 .",
    "the absence of pure interband superconductivity with zero energy states has also been established in other systems.@xcite the absence of sub - gap states is further confirmed by numerically solving the original hamiltonian @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hab ] ) . for isolated bands ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath112 , we have the bcs energy gap relationship @xmath113 in each band , where the superscript @xmath114 stands for the self - consistent result found for fixed pair potentials @xmath115 . for finite @xmath32 we always find @xmath116 , with @xmath117 modified in the presence of a finite band hybridization .",
    "thus , the energy gap is never smaller than the intraband bcs gaps .",
    "the lack of low - energy signatures of the odd - frequency odd - interband pairing is similar to the odd - frequency pairing behavior in topological insulator / superconductor heterostructures @xcite and in heavy - fermion compounds.@xcite together these results demonstrate that odd - frequency pairing often have a frequency dependence which do not generate sub - gap states .",
    "in summary , we have found the general symmetry rule for spatial parity @xmath118 , time reversal @xmath119 , and orbital parity @xmath120 for multi - band superconductors to be @xmath121 for spin - singlet ( triplet ) pairing . within a generic microscopic model of multi - band superconductors",
    "we have shown that odd - frequency pairing always exists in the form of odd - interband ( orbital ) pairing if there is any even - frequency even - interband pairing present , consistent with the general symmetry requirements . even - interband pairing can exist intrinsically in multi - band superconductors , but also a finite band hybridization together with non - identical intraband order parameter strengths give even - interband pairing .",
    "in fact , we find a complete reciprocity between parity in band ( orbital ) index and frequency for the superconducting pair amplitude , which naturally follows from @xmath122 for spin - singlet @xmath0-wave ( or spin - triplet @xmath2-wave ) pairing .",
    "the @xmath0-wave nature makes the odd - frequency pairing resistant to disorder scattering .",
    "these results show that odd - frequency pairing is present in the bulk state of many superconductors , requiring no external symmetry breaking such as interfaces or magnetic fields .    in this work we assumed an even - frequency order parameter and showed that it induces an odd - frequency pair amplitude .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that the order parameter in some multi - band superconductors has an odd - frequency dependence , but that it induces a finite even - frequency pair amplitude , which is mistaken to also be the ( even - frequency ) order parameter .",
    "one example might be the heavy fermion compounds , which have been propose to have an odd - frequency order parameter.@xcite since establishing the symmetry of the superconducting pair condensate is a crucial first step in elucidating the pairing mechanism , our work provides a new approach to superconducting pairing in multi - band superconductors .",
