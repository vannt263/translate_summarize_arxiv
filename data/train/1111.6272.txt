    "a long - standing problem in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics has been to provide a derivation from first principles of fourier s law of heat conduction in insulating materials in the framework of hamiltonian mechanics @xcite .",
    "a centerpiece of the puzzle is to identify the conditions under which scale separation occurs so the time evolution at the microscopic level can somehow be reduced to a hydrodynamic equation at the macroscopic level , which is an especially challenging problem for interacting particle systems .",
    "as emphasized in earlier papers @xcite , the following two - step program , which consists of ( i ) identifying an intermediate level of description  a mesoscopic scale  where the newtonian dynamics can be consistently approximated by a set of stochastic equations , and ( ii ) subsequently analyzing the statistical properties of this stochastic system and computing its transport properties in the hydrodynamic scaling limit , can be successfully achieved in a class of chaotic billiard systems composed of many hard disks trapped in a semi - porous material which prevents mass transfer and yet allows energy transfer through elastic collisions among neighboring disks .    under the assumption that collisions among moving disks",
    "are rare compared to wall collision events , the global multi - particle probability distribution of the system typically reaches local equilibrium at the kinetic energy of each individual particle before energy exchanges proceed .",
    "this mechanism naturally yields a stochastic description for the process of energy exchanges in the system . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the same reduction applies to systems of confined hard spheres .",
    "our purpose in this paper is twofold .",
    "our main objective is to establish a comparison between the process of energy transfer in models of interacting hard spheres with local confinement rules , on the one hand , and the diffusive motion of tracer particles in low - dimensional billiard tables such as the finite - horizon periodic lorentz gas , on the other .",
    "specifically , we show that the two systems , under equivalent assumptions of local equilibration , whose accuracy can be precisely controlled by tuning the systems parameters down to a critical geometry , are both amenable to stochastic descriptions in the form of master equations , whether for the distribution of energies in the case of the former systems , or that of mass in the latter . taking the hydrodynamic limit of these stochastic systems",
    ", we obtain explicit values of the transport coefficients of heat conduction and diffusion respectively , which turn out to share the remarkable property that they are given by simple dimensional formulae , i.  e. by the square of the mesoscopic length scale multiplied respectively by the rates of energy or mass transfer .",
    "turning back to the billiard dynamics , we address our second objective , which is to show that , under the assumption of separation of two characteristic timescales , one associated with the local dynamics , the other with energy transfers , the process of heat transport in three - dimensional billiard systems of confined hard spheres is well - approximated by the corresponding stochastic process of energy exchanges .",
    "we do so by considering the helfand moment of thermal conductivity @xcite and compute the linear divergence in time of its mean squared change . plotting our results as functions of the system s sizes for different parameter values , we compute the infinite - size extrapolations to obtain the heat conductivity and observe a very good convergence to the value obtained for the stochastic systems for parameter values where an effective separation of timescales is observed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the problem of mass transport in a spatially periodic billiard table is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec.mass ] .",
    "starting from the pseudo - liouville equation for the billiard dynamics , we derive a continuous - time random walk which describes the stochastic jumps of particles across a lattice , and analyze its transport properties , comparing it to that of the billiard .",
    "the same procedure is applied in sec .",
    "[ sec.engy2d ] to two - dimensional billiards of confined hard disks . in sec .",
    "[ sec.engy3d ] , we turn to a three - dimensional billiard system and discuss our numerical results .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec.conc ] .",
    "we consider for the sake of the example a periodic array of two - dimensional semi - dispersing sinai billiard tables in the form of square billiard cells bounded by flat walls of sizes @xmath0 , and connected to each other by small openings of relative widths @xmath1 .",
    "all the cells are identical and contain circular obstacles arranged so that there are no periodic trajectory that avoid these obstacles .",
    "independent pointwise tracer particles move across this array , performing elastic collisions on the obstacles and walls .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ fig.sinaitable ] .",
    "the diffusive properties of this model were studied in some details in ref .  [ ] . there",
    "the attention was on memory effects and their impact on the value of the diffusion coefficient . here",
    "we will focus on the derivation of the kinetic prediction of this coefficient , which yields the aforementioned dimensional formula , disregarding the memory effects .",
    "the conclusions are similar to those obtained by machta and zwanzig @xcite in the framework of the periodic lorentz gas .",
    "the continuous - time approach we present below is somewhat similar to that of zwanzig @xcite .",
    "the phase - space configuration of this system refers to a single tracer particle and is specified by the triplet @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the lattice index of the cell where the tracer is located , @xmath4 , its position within the cell and @xmath5 its velocity .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the probability distribution of the tracer .",
    "its time evolution is determined by the pseudo - liouville operator @xcite , which comprises four different types of contributions , corresponding to as many different types of events :    1 .",
    "free advection of the tracer inside the cell is accounted for by the term @xmath7 ; 2 .",
    "collisions of the tracer with any of the circular obstacles inside the cell are determined by the operators @xmath8 , where @xmath9 refers to a specific disk of radius @xmath10 at position @xmath11 : @xmath12\\ , ;      \\label{diskcoll }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] 3 .",
    "collisions of the tracer with any of the flat walls of cell @xmath13 , with operator @xmath14 , where @xmath15 takes on the values @xmath16 , corresponding to the right , bottom , left and top walls : letting @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the position and velocity components of the tracer along the horizontal axis , wall # 1 is the right wall at position @xmath19 so that , if the wall is continuous with respect to the vertical axis , i.  e. @xmath20 , the collision operator acts according to @xmath21 \\ , ,      \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with similar expressions for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ; 4 .",
    "jump events between neighboring cells take place when a wall collision event occurs at a position where the wall is actually open , which amounts to subtracting the action of the wall operator ( [ wallcoll1 ] ) above , keeping track of the cell indices : using the same set of four indices as above for every wall and assuming that wall # 1 has a slit of width @xmath1 centered about @xmath25 , the jump operator @xmath26 is @xmath27 \\ , ,      \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 otherwise .",
    "collecting these terms together , we obtain the time evolution of @xmath6 , given by the pseudo - liouville equation : @xmath31 the terms on the right - hand side of this equation are grouped so as to distinguish the _ local _ terms , which do not act on the cell index in the distribution , from the _ non - local _ ones , i.  e. the jump terms , which act on the cell index .",
    "also note that the velocity amplitude is invariant under every term of this equation and is therefore a conserved quantity which plays no role once it has been fixed by the initial condition .",
    "it it an immediate consequence of the ergodicity of the local dynamics that the following distribution , @xmath32 is invariant under the local terms of the pseudo - liouville equation ( [ pseudoliouville ] ) .",
    "we thus refer to @xmath33 as the _ local equilibrium distribution_. its time evolution occurs through jump events only  : @xmath34 in order to close this equation for @xmath33 , we make the _ local equilibrium approximation _ , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the area of the billiard , e.  g. @xmath37 in the case of figure [ fig.sinaitable ] ( where @xmath38 denotes the radius of the disk at the center of the cell and @xmath39 that of the disks at the cell corners ) .",
    "plugging eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) into ( [ peqevol1 ] ) , the pseudo - liouville equation ( [ pseudoliouville ] ) reduces to the following _ continuous - time random walk _",

    "the fact that it is an exact property of the stochastic process is remarkable .",
    "as far as the transport properties of the billiard table go , eq .  ( [ diffcoeff ] ) is a mere approximation : its validity relies on the local equilibrium approximation ( [ closure ] ) .",
    "in contrast , eq .  ( [ defjumprate ] ) is an exact result for the billiard dynamics as well  valid for all parameter values  as it relies solely on the ergodicity of the billiard table @xcite .",
    "the closure approximation ( [ closure ] ) is expected to be exact in the limit of vanishing window widths , @xmath49 , whereby the hopping rate ( [ defjumprate ] ) diverges and the diffusion coefficient ( [ diffcoeff ] ) vanishes . in practice",
    "however , we may expect @xmath6 to converge to the local equilibrium distribution @xmath33 between successive jumps so long as the typical number of disk collision events within a cell is large .",
    "this can be verified numerically , as shown on the top panel of figure [ fig.diff ] .",
    "these numerical results were already reported in ref .",
    "similar results are equally obtainable for three dimensional billiard systems such as the three - dimensional periodic lorentz gas @xcite .",

    "classes of such models were initially introduced by bunimovich _ et .",

    "are so chosen that ( i ) black circles overlap , so the moving disks are confined , and ( ii ) collisions are allowed ( such as in the upper right corner ) , whereby energy exchanges take place .",

    "[ ] , we introduce the following parametrization of the model in terms of two parameters : @xmath51 , which characterizes the timescale of wall collision events , and @xmath50 , which characterizes that of binary collisions .",
    "on the one hand , the dynamics within an isolated cell of width @xmath0 boils down to the motion of a point particle in an area bounded by the exterior intersection of four disks of radius @xmath51 , @xmath52 . in the absence of interaction with neighboring particles ,",
    "the mean free path of a particle is given by @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote respectively the area and perimeter of the billiard cell .",
    "the corresponding wall collision timescale is obtained by multiplying the mean free path by the speed of the particle .",
    "interactions among neighboring particles on the other hand take place provided the radius of the moving particles @xmath50 is larger than a critical value , @xmath55",
    ". the corresponding timescale can be computed and shown to diverge with @xmath56 . letting @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively denote the frequencies of wall collision and binary collision events measured at equilibrium temperature @xmath59 , the following separation of timescales is assumed , @xmath60 which occurs when @xmath61 .    under this assumption",
    ", we showed@xcite that the heat conductivity of spatially extended billiard systems , which are infinite size limits of systems such as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.2dlatticeb ] , reduces , up to a dimensional factor @xmath62 , to the frequency of binary collisions , @xmath63 furthermore the heat conductivity scales with the thermal speed , @xmath64 .",
    "although eqs .",
    "( [ diffcoeff ] ) and ( [ kappanu ] ) are very much alike , the derivation of the latter is much more involved than that of the former .    proceeding as in sec .",

    "is obtained by plugging back the proper timescale of binary collisions and letting @xmath95 so that the separation of timescales ( [ septimes ] ) is effective .",
    "unlike mass transport in sinai billiard tables for which the transport equation ( [ fpeq ] ) follows directly from the continuous - time random walk ( [ meq ] ) , so that there only remains the problem of comparing the diffusion coefficient of the billiard to the dimension formula ( [ diffcoeff ] ) in the appropriate parameter regime , the problem of computing the heat conductivity associated with heat transport in billiard systems of many confined particles proceeds in two separate steps .",

    "by controlling the rate at which a tracer hops from cell to cell in a sinai billiard table or that of interaction among neighboring disks or spheres in a high - dimensional billiard with local confinement rules , one identifies a limit of vanishing rate where the complicated phase - space dynamics are replaced by stochastic processes which account for the transport of mass in the first case , or ( kinetic ) energy in the second .",
    "furthermore , the transport coefficients of these stochastic processes have the same simple dimensional expression , given by the length scale of transfers squared multiplied by the corresponding rates .",
    "as emphasized in this paper , the dimensional formulae we obtained for the transport coefficients of the models of mass and heat transport we have considered are but two faces of the same coin .",
    "indeed , in both cases the accuracy of our approximation of the transport coefficients of the billiards in terms of hopping or collision rates relies on the efficient separation of two timescales , namely the timescale of local collision events must be much shorter than that characterizing the transfer of mass or energy . in other words , the relaxation to local equilibrium precedes mass or energy transfers .",
    "we can in fact view the notion of relaxation to local equilibrium as a low - dimensional transposition of that of local thermal equilibrium , which is at the heart of many theories involving hydrodynamic scaling limits and typically assumes a large number of degrees of freedom @xcite . in our billiards ,",
    "the relaxation to local equilibrium occurs on the constant energy surface of a single particle .",
    "but one could instead consider systems of trapped gases , in which case the relaxation to local equilibrium would involve transfers of energy among the particles in the same trap . in such a case , provided relaxation to local equilibrium takes place on timescales much shorter than that of energy transfer between neighboring traps , a similar dimensional expression of the heat conductivity of the corresponding stochastic process in terms of the product of length scale squared and rate of energy transfer would yield an accurate approximation of the transport coefficient of the billiard system .",
    "we end with a remark concerning the closure ( [ closure ] ) which relies on the ergodicity of the local dynamics on the surface of constant energy .",
    "as noted already by zwanzig @xcite , sinai billiards can not be replaced by polygonal ones , for which the notion of ergodicity is weaker since the velocity directions take on values in a discrete set . in energy exchange processes , however , ergodicity of the many - particle billiard may be restored through the sole interaction among neighboring particles .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , an elastic string - type interaction between particles trapped in polygonal boxes provides a simple model of a system which , on the one hand , can not be accurately described by a master equation similar to eq .  ( [ mastereq ] ) , even when interactions are rare , but on the other hand , has a well - defined heat conductivity which is well approximated by a dimensional formula . an understanding of the transport properties of this system beyond the boltzmann hypothesis remains to be elucidated .",
