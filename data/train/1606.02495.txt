    "used an extrapolation of the equation of state of bcc te@xcite to lower pressures whereas we used the actual atomic volume@xcite of te at 20  gpa as a reference .",

    "as it is not possible to obtain an ordered structure of bi@xmath2te@xmath3 on the basis of a cubic unit cell containing only two atoms , we considered superstructures that are compatible with the given stoichiometry , such as the cubic pr@xmath6c@xmath20 structure type , but none of these was consistent with the observed diffraction pattern .",
    "we also considered the monoclinic structure  nine / ten - fold @xmath21  proposed by zhu _",

    "building on this realization and taking into account the substitutional disorder before annealing , we determined the structures of the annealed  phases to be semi - disordered variants of the b2 structure type . in each case , one crystallographic site of the b2 unit cell is essentially occupied by the majority element only , whereas the other site is randomly occupied by either element under the constraint of the overall stoichiometry . for bi@xmath2te@xmath3 , one site is then , ideally , fully occupied by te and the other site has a mixed occupancy by bi and te at a ratio of 80:20 as illustrated in fig .",

    "the bcc bi phase has a lattice parameter slightly larger@xcite than that of b2-type bi@xmath2te at this pressure , so that it produces shoulders on the lower - angle sides of the bi@xmath2te diffraction peaks as shown in the inset to fig .",

    "two subsequent annealing steps at lower pressures of 1718  gpa eventually produced almost complete ( 97% ) ordering .",

    "the charge transfer depends only weakly on the pressure and decreases with increasing pressure to 0.40  @xmath33 at 100  gpa .",

    "the degree of ionicity is generally difficult to quantify , and model - dependent , and the results of several studies vary correspondingly . the combined dft and tight - binding calculations by mishra _",

    "an earlier tight - binding model by pecheur and toussaint @xcite had indicated ionic charges about 50% lower than those obtained by mishra _",

    "are also at variance .    to further address the question whether any significant covalent contribution to the chemical bonding is still present at high pressure in the cubic phases ( as suggested in refs ) , we have calculated the electron localization function ( elf ) @xcite for bite .",

    "the overall picture emerging from these calculations is thus one where the mixed covalent - ionic plus van - der - waals bonding found in the bismuth tellurides at ambient conditions gives way to metallic bonding with a significant ionic component at high pressures of @xmath420  gpa .",

    "the semi - ordered phases for the compositions other than bite represent the most - ordered configurations that can be achieved within the bcc / b2 structure type under the constraint of the given stoichiometry . secondly , the ion ordering in bite causes a suppression of the electronic density of states near the fermi level , and hence a lowering of the band structure contribution to the total energy .",
    "it is not clear at present to what extent this second effect contributes to the formation of the semi - ordered phases .",
    "figure  [ fig : bite_bandstructures](a ) shows that several electronic bands cross the fermi level in b2-type bite and that there are three band extrema in close proximity to the fermi level .",

    "<S> pressure - induced transitions from ordered intermetallic phases to substitutional alloys to semi - ordered phases were studied in a series of bismuth tellurides . using angle - dispersive x - ray diffraction , the compounds bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , bite , and bi@xmath2te </S>",
    "<S> were observed to form alloys with the disordered body - centered cubic ( bcc ) crystal structure upon compression to above 1419  gpa at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the bite and bi@xmath2te alloys and the previously discovered high - pressure alloys of bi@xmath2te@xmath3 and bi@xmath0te@xmath3 were all found to show atomic ordering after gentle annealing at very moderate temperatures of @xmath4100c . upon annealing , </S>",
    "<S> bite transforms from the bcc to the b2 ( cscl ) crystal structure type , and the other phases adopt semi - disordered variants thereof , featuring substitutional disorder on one of the two crystallographic sites . </S>",
    "<S> the transition pressures and atomic volumes of the alloy phases show systematic variations across the  series including the end members bi and te . </S>",
    "<S> first - principles calculations were performed to characterize the electronic structure and chemical bonding properties of b2-type bite and to identify the driving forces of the ordering transition . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated fermi surface of b2-type bite has an intricate structure and is predicted to undergo three topological changes between 20 and 60  gpa . </S>"
