    "heavy - fermion systems ( hfss ) are characterized by quasiparticles with a very large effective mass at low temperatures @xmath3 .",
    "this behavior occurs in many lanthanide ( rare - earth ) and actinide compounds and has its origin in the hybridization between the conduction bands and the local moments of incompletely filled @xmath2 shells of the lanthanide or actinide ions.@xcite these @xmath2 electrons contribute substantially to the formation of the heavy quasiparticles .",

    "disorder is introduced by substitution of ligand ions ( _ disorder on the ligand sites _ ) or of lanthanide or actinide ions ( _ disorder on the @xmath2 site _ ) .",
    "a special case of disorder on the @xmath2 site is given by replacing @xmath2-electron ions ( e.g. , ce ) by a certain amount of nonmagnetic impurities ( e.g. , la ) referred to as `` kondo holes . ''",
    "while we focus on local disorder only , band disorder in the kondo lattice model has been recently considered@xcite using a slave - boson mean - field approach .    disorder has strong impact on the transport properties such as @xmath4 and @xmath14 . in substitutional alloys such as la@xmath17ce@xmath18pd@xmath5,@xcite ce@xmath18la@xmath17cu@xmath6,@xcite ce@xmath18la@xmath17cu@xmath19si@xmath7,@xcite u@xmath17th@xmath18pd@xmath7al@xmath5,@xcite , etc . , the residual resistivity @xmath20 rapidly increases with increasing concentration @xmath21 of the nonmagnetic impurities , and one obtains a crossover from the metallic @xmath4 behavior with a maximum to a monotonic curve , where @xmath4 decreases with increasing @xmath3 .",

    ", the lattice model is mapped on an effective single - impurity anderson model@xcite ( siam ) by a self - consistency condition .",

    "the nrg is a nonperturbative method applicable at very low temperatures which reproduces the correct characteristic low - temperature scale ( kondo temperature).@xcite    in the present paper , we extend the dmft - nrg treatment to the disordered pam .",
    "the disorder is studied within the coherent - potential approximation@xcite ( cpa ) .",
    "the cpa was originally developed for alloys modeled by noninteracting particles . in the cpa , lattice coherence is restored by introducing an average potential .",
    "jani and vollhardt have pointed out that the local nature of the potential allows one to embed the cpa into the dmft framework@xcite emphasizing that the cpa is the best possible single - site approximation@xcite for disorder . on the other hand",
    ", the dmft can be interpreted as cpa for periodic correlated electron systems as the dmft reduces to the cpa equations in the absence of electron - electron interactions.@xcite this allows for generalizations of the cpa to disordered systems with finite coulomb repulsion which has been exploited in the context of the hubbard model.@xcite    there exists a number of previous works in which the influence of disorder on the electronic properties of hfss has been studied.@xcite most of these papers consider the case of disorder by kondo holes only .",
    "the earliest work@xcite applied the alloy analog approximation to the pam as a cpa application .",
    "other treatments@xcite used the slave - boson mean - field approximation to the pam , which enabled a straightforward application of the standard cpa.@xcite schlottmann@xcite studied the development of impurity bands within the hybridization gap of kondo insulators in the low - concentration limit using the iterative pertubation theory ( itp ) .",

    ", we call this extension `` cpa '' , too , and stick to the name `` dmft '' for pure systems without disorder . here",
    ", we apply such a generalized cpa to the disordered pam and calculate the transport quantities @xmath4 and @xmath14 for disorder on the @xmath2 site as well as for disorder on the ligand sites .",

    "we find that this cpa - nrg treatment of the pam is able to explain the strong disorder dependence of the transport quantities of hfss .",
    "a generalization of the cpa for binary alloys to infinitely many local environments has been considered in the context of ligand disorder of ucu@xmath25pd@xmath18 by dobrosavljevi and co - workers.@xcite those locally different environments yield a distribution of hybridization strengths between the actinide and the conduction band at each site and , as a consequence , a distribution of kondo scales . by averaging over these different low - energy scales ,",
    "a non - fermi - liquid behavior of transport properties was obtained.@xcite    hfss often exhibit symmetry broken phases such as superconductivity@xcite or antiferromagnetism,@xcite which are certainly not yet properly understood .",
    "such phase transitions at finite temperatures can be qualitatively understood within the pam,@xcite but the complete phase diagram of the model in three dimensions has not yet been determined . a vanishing transition temperature as a function of an external control parameter such as magnetic field , pressure , or doping defines the quantum critical point ( qcp ) , at which the transition is governed by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations .",
    "this sparked a lot of experimental@xcite as well as theoretical@xcite interest since it is believed that these fluctuations strongly affect the transport properties at a finite temperature in a cone close to the qcp.@xcite a proper microscopic description of such qcp requires the treatment of one- and two - particle properties on equal footing , which is beyond the scope of the present investigation and must be left for future research .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the influence of disorder on transport properties in the paramagnetic phase of the model .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we introduce the model and the notations as well as our calculation methods , the dmft , the cpa , and the nrg as impurity solver . section  [ sec : kondoholes ] is devoted to the special case of kondo holes : in sec .",
    "[ sec : kondoholes - analyticalconsiderations ] , simplifications of the cpa equations are considered , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : kondoholes - spectralproperties ] , we discuss the temperature - dependent spectral functions and self - energy of the pam .",

    "we explicitly state equations for the resistivity @xmath26 and the thermoelectric power @xmath27 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : transport - results ] , results on the temperature dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath14 are reported , both for disorder on the @xmath2 site and disorder on the ligand sites . we conclude with a summary and outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the essential features of heavy - fermion compounds are based on the interplay of localized , strongly correlated @xmath2 electrons with broad conduction bands . at high temperature , the weakly coupled @xmath2",
    "electrons cause mainly incoherent and , with decreasing temperature , logarithmically growing spin - flip scattering for the conduction electrons . below a characteristic temperature scale , a crossover to a coherent low - temperature phase",
    "is observed .",
    "the @xmath2 electrons contribute significantly to the formation of heavy quasiparticles , while their moments are dynamically screened .",
    "the pam takes these ingredients into account , comprising of spin degenerate conduction electrons , a lattice of correlated localized @xmath2 electrons , and a hybridization ( cf .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the influence of disorder in hfss . in general , alloying with different ingredients @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ,  , with concentrations @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ,  , respectively , destroys the lattice periodicity . here , we consider only substitutional alloys of the type @xmath34 with concentrations @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this section is divided into two parts : in the first part , we will introduce the model for periodic systems , which is extended to binary alloys in the second part .",
    "the hamiltonian of the simplest version of the pam is given by@xcite @xmath37 here , @xmath38",

    "the uncorrelated conduction electrons hybridize locally with the @xmath2 electrons via the matrix element @xmath50 .",
    "even though only a single effective @xmath2 level is considered , this model is quite general .",
    "it describes any heavy - fermion system with odd ground - state filling of the @xmath2 shell , for which in a strong crystal field environment the degenerate hund s rule ground state may be reduced to an effective spin - degenerate kramers doublet . in addition , charge fluctuations to even @xmath2 fillings leave the @xmath2 shell in crystal field singlets .",
    "the hamiltonian contains four energy scales .",
    "the interplay between @xmath44 and @xmath49 controls the average @xmath2 filling as well as the local moment formation for large @xmath49 and negative @xmath44 .",
    "the anderson width @xmath51 determines the charge fluctuation scale of the @xmath2 electrons , with @xmath52 being the density of states of the noninteracting conduction band of width @xmath53 at its band center .",
    "the total filling per site , @xmath54 , is kept constant by a temperature - dependent chemical potential @xmath55 .",
    "we absorb the energy shifts into the band center @xmath43 of the conduction band , as well as the @xmath2 level @xmath44 . for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "the uncorrelated system is an insulator at @xmath58 , since the lower of the two hybridized bands is completely filled . according to luttinger s theorem , a finite @xmath49 of arbitrary strength does not change the fermi volume , which includes the full first brillouin zone .",
    "as long as the ground state does not change the symmetry due to a phase transition , the system remains an insulator at arbitrarily large coulomb repulsion .",
    "therefore , the nonmetallic ground state of kondo insulators is not correlation induced , but it is already present for the noninteracting system and is a consequence of luttinger s theorem . for nonintegral values of @xmath59 , the paramagnetic phase of the system must be metallic .      the simplest version ( [ eq : pam - hamil ] ) of the pam can be extended to describe two subsystems by replacing the matrix @xmath60 by a random potential @xmath61 . at each lattice site @xmath45 ,",
    "two different values are possible with a probability @xmath1 that is given by the relative concentration of subsystem @xmath28 : @xmath62    in the case of no doping ( i.e. , @xmath63 or @xmath24 or @xmath64 ) , the extended model reduces to eq .",

    "no exact analytical solution has been found for the model ( [ eq : pam - hamil ] ) with finite @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , one has to rely on suitable approximations for the pam . an obvious first approximation is the assumption of a purely local , site - diagonal ( i.e. , @xmath67 independent ) self - energy , which for the pam is even better justified than for other lattice models of correlated electron systems , as the first corrections are at least of order @xmath68 . within a local self - energy approximation , the complicated lattice model can be mapped on an effective siam.@xcite such a mapping was first used about 20 years ago in connection with the applications of the noncrossing approximation@xcite ( nca ) to the pam.@xcite the effective site is viewed as a correlated atomic problem within a time - dependent ( or energy - dependent ) external field@xcite which is determined self - consistently , thus accounting for the feedback of the electron propagation through the lattice.@xcite using the scaling of the tight - binding hopping parameter in large dimensions by metzner and vollhardt,@xcite mller - hartmann@xcite has proven that the local self - energy approximation becomes exact in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions . therefore , the self - consistency condition of the dmft,@xcite which neglects spatial fluctuations in the single - particle self - energy , becomes exact in the limit @xmath69 . within weak - coupling @xmath49-perturbation theory",

    "we can put the site - diagonal green functions into a green function matrix    [ eq : gf - matrix ] @xmath87 but it is sufficient to know one of the components because they are connected to each other : @xmath88    furthermore , the self - consistency condition ( [ eq : pam - scc ] ) extends to the full matrix , @xmath89 .",

    "our approach reduces to the standard dmft at those points corresponding to concentrated systems ( @xmath24 and @xmath64 ) ; i.e. , our treatment of the transport properties interpolates between two concentrated systems consisting only of pure @xmath28 or @xmath29 sites .    to make contact to typical experimental situations ,",
    "we have studied two types of local disorder : introduction of kondo holes and disorder on the ligand sites . in the case of doping with kondo holes ,",
    "we find an increasing characteristic low - temperature scale @xmath203 , defined via the quasiparticle renormalization factor , as a function of the hole concentration for constant hybridization .",
    "this is consistent with a previous comparison between the dmft and siam energy scales.@xcite however , in experiments , often only a weak dependence of the low - energy scale as a function of doping has been observed.@xcite therefore , we investigated the change of the transport properties as a function of concentration for a fixed effective low - energy scale .",
    "such an ansatz is consistent with an experimentally found increase of the lattice constants upon ce substitution by la , justifying a linear reduction of the hybridization strength with increasing concentration of the kondo holes .",
    "the calculated resistivity normalized to the ce concentration shows a characteristic logarithmic upturn when lowering the temperature . in the periodic system ,",
    "the resistivity decreases again after a maximum is reached , which is a sign of lattice coherence .",
    "introducing kondo holes reduces the scattering of the @xmath2 electrons and gradually destroys lattice coherence .",
    "the normalized resistivity continuously varies from that of a concentrated system to that of a typical dilute kondo scatterer .",
    "while we observe scaling with the concentration at high temperature , multiscattering of conduction - band electrons introduces an additional enhancement factor @xmath298 in the residual resistivity for @xmath359 , which can become already important for concentrations less than 10% . since the thermoelectric power is given by a ratio of two transport integrals , it is much less sensitive to disorder .",
    "the scaling properties of doped and undoped heavy - fermion materials appear to be inconsistent with a simple fermi - liquid theory and have caused a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "the terminology `` non - fermi liquid '' was coined for those materials whose thermodynamic and transport properties are not well understood  for a review , see ref .  .",
    "usually , the deviation from a @xmath8 law has been attributed to scattering of conduction electrons on thermal and quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order parameter in the vicinity of a quantum critical point .",
    "such effects would generate a @xmath139-dependent self - energy which is not included in our treatment . the effective site for the kondo - hole disorder problem reaches the strong - coupling fixed point at low enough temperature in our cpa - nrg theory .",
    "consequently , we know analytically that the local self - energy @xmath360 has fermi - liquid properties in this regime .",
    "the scaling regime for such a @xmath8 law , however , turns out to be very small . the self - consistency condition and multiscattering contributions to transport properties reorganize spectral weight in our many - body calculation .",
    "therefore , the crossover regime starts relatively early . in this regime",
    ", one might be able to identify a rather extended temperature range in which a power law with a fixed exponent @xmath361 can be obtained with the same accuracy as determined in experiments .",
    "however , the physical meaning of such an exponent obtained in a crossover from a low - temperature scaling regime is not apparent to us .",
    "thus , we did not intend to extract such a parameter .    in the case of ligand disorder",
    ", we have shown calculations which interpolate between two metallic systems as well as describe the crossover from a kondo insulator to a metallic hfs .",
    "each unit cell contains one kondo scatterer which experiences a different environment .",
    "a changing hybridization matrix element leads to two different local low - temperature scales . for a constant hybridization matrix element",
    ", we do not observe a shift in the position of the resistivity maximum .",
    "the resistivity follows the typical heavy - fermion behavior with a concentration - dependent residual resisitivity which peaks close to the concentration of @xmath292 . in the thermoelectric power , however , we note a sign change at very low temperatures from positive values for @xmath327 to negative values for @xmath362 similar to the one observed@xcite in cecu@xmath7si@xmath7 .",
    "the thermoelectric power is very sensitive to particle - hole asymmetries in the spectral functions .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that the combination of cpa and dmft is capable of accurately capturing the interplay of effects that are connected to local correlations , on the one hand , and the average influence of disorder , on the other hand .",
    "we discuss ligand disorder in addition to the conventionally investigated introduction of kondo holes .",
    "such ligand disorder is relevant for a variety of hfss and , in particular , interesting in connection with cecu@xmath363au@xmath18 , the paradigm of non - fermi - liquid behavior in the vicinity of a quantum phase transition . due to the lack of nonlocal fluctuations in the dmft - cpa treatment",
    ", it will not be possible to study the quantum critical regime within our method .",
    "however , within our approach0 we can investigate the influence of the ligand disorder on magnetic properties to obtain the magnetic phase diagram .",
