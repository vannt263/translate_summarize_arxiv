    "the formation mechanism of jets is a key issue in the study of the magnetospheric structure of compact astrophysical objects .",
    "indeed , jets are observed in most compact sources , ranging from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , quasars , and radio galaxies  @xcite to accreting neutron stars , solar - mass black holes ( ss 433 , x - ray novae )  @xcite , and young stellar objects  @xcite .",
    "moreover , jets have also been recently discovered in young radio pulsars  @xcite . at the same time , in most studies devoted to the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model of such objects  @xcite , in which the formation of jets is coupled with the attraction of longitudinal currents flowing in the magnetosphere , the attention was focused on intrinsic collimation in the sense that the effect of the external medium was assumed to be marginal .",
    "however , such a situation is possible only for a nonzero total current @xmath2 flowing within the jet  @xcite , so the question of its closure in the outer parts of the magnetosphere arises . on the other hand , the longitudinal current",
    "is often constrained by the regularity condition at the fast magnetosonic surface , which by no means always leads to the sufficiently large longitudinal currents required for collimation  @xcite . in other words , with the exception of the force - free case  @xcite , as yet no working model of a jet in which , on the one hand , the total electric current would be zero and , on the other hand , the total magnetic flux @xmath3 in the jet would be finite , has been constructed .",
    "however , the force - free approximation , in which , by definition , the particle energy density is disregarded , does not allow the fraction of energy transferred by the outflowing plasma to be determined .",
    "at the same time , the question of collimation can not be solved in isolation from the external conditions ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in particular , this is clear even from a popular example of the magnetosphere of a compact object with a monopole magnetic field , because for any arbitrarily weak external regular magnetic field , the monopole solution ( for which the magnetic field falls off as @xmath4 ) can not be extended to infinity . moreover , as is well known from an example of moving cosmic bodies , such as jupiter s moons  @xcite or artificial earth satellites  @xcite , as well as radio pulsars  @xcite , the external magnetic field can serve as an effective transfer link , which occasionally determines the general energy losses of the system .",
    "for this reason , constructing a consistent magnetospheric model for compact objects immersed in an external magnetic field is , in our view , of undeniable interest , especially since , as was noted above , such a jet model was previously constructed in the force - free approximation  @xcite .    undoubtedly , the existence of an external regular magnetic field in the vicinity of compact objects is largely open to question .",
    "the regular magnetic field in our galaxy , i.e. , the field that is constant on scales comparable to the sizes of our galaxy , is known to be @xmath5 and essentially matches the random magnetic - field component , which varies even on scales of several parsecs  @xcite .",
    "however , if the collimation is assumed to be actually produced by an external magnetic field , it becomes possible to estimate the jet radius .",
    "indeed , assuming the magnetic field in the jet to be similar to the external magnetic field  ( [ 1 ] ) , we obtain from the condition for the conservation of magnetic flux @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the radius and magnetic field of the compact object , respectively .",
    "for example , for agns ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , we have @xmath11 which corresponds to the observed jet radii  @xcite",
    ". one might expect such a picture to be also preserved for an external medium with pressure @xmath12 ; therefore , it seems of interest to consider the internal structure of a one - dimensional jet immersed in an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "however , a discussion of the more realistic case of a medium with pressure is beyond the scope of this study . nor",
    "do we discuss the collimation itself but only consider the internal structure of observed one - dimensional jets .",
    "this issue has become particularly urgent because of the new possibilities offered by space radio interferometry , which enables the internal structure of such jets to be resolved .",
    "the effect of an external medium on the internal structure of relativistic jets in the mhd model discussed here was previously studied only by appl and camenzind  @xcite .",
    "they considered only a special case with a constant angular velocity of the plasma , in which the solution with a zero total electric field flowing inside the jet could not be constructed . as we show below",
    ", it is for the case of an angular velocity decreasing toward the jet periphery ( which , incidentally , is typical of all models with a magnetic field passing through the accretion disk ) that the solution with finite magnetic flux @xmath3 and zero total current @xmath13 can be constructed .",
    "on the other hand , many authors  @xcite obtained a universal solution with a central core for a cylindrical jet : @xmath14 where , in the relativistic case , @xmath15 is the size of the central core , @xmath16 is the angular velocity of the compact object , and @xmath17 is the characteristic lorentz factor of the outflowing plasma . as can be easily seen , such a solution results in a rapid falloff of the poloidal field @xmath18 far from the rotation axis @xmath19 .",
    "however , this solution is in conflict with the force - free approximation , in which the poloidal magnetic field remains essentially constant  @xcite .",
    "indeed , when the energy density of the electromagnetic field exceeds appreciably the plasma energy density ( and it is this case that was considered ) , it would be natural to assume that the internal jet structure must be similar to the force - free one .",
    "the examples given above show that a more detailed study with allowance for all possible solutions is required even in the simplest case of a one - dimensional cylindrical jet considered in terms of ideal magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "our study aims at a consistent investigation of this issue .",
    "several features that we use when studying the structure of relativistic jets typical of agns and radio pulsars should be immediately noted .",
    "first of all , the jet radius @xmath20 in all real cases proves to be considerably larger than the light - cylinder radius @xmath21 .",
    "this implies that , when the internal structure of jets is investigated , the corresponding equations must be written in complete relativistic form . on the other hand ,",
    "the gravitational forces can be disregarded in them far from the compact object . finally , for simplicity , we consider below a cold plasma , which is justifiable because the thermal processes in the magnetospheres of radio pulsars play no crucial role . as for the jets from agns , this approximation is applicable here in those magnetospheric regions in which the plasma density is low . in any case , this is true for the field lines passing through the surface of a black hole .",
    "the one - dimensional solutions describing collimated jets are obtained in sect .",
    "2 ; analytic and numerical solutions for the basic physical quantities characterizing the structure and physics of jets are given in sect .",
    "the problem is solved in straightforward statement ; i.e. , all jets characteristics are determined by a set of parameters in the compact source and , most importantly , by the physical conditions in the external medium . as a result , we have found the conditions under which most of the energy in actual relativistic jets must be transferred by the electromagnetic field , while a region with subsonic flow exists in the central jet regions .",
    "we also show that the solution with a central core  ( [ 4 ] ) and  ( [ 5 ] ) can not be realized in an external magnetic field . finally , some astrophysical implications of the theory developed for one - dimensional jets are discussed in sect .",
    "let us consider the structure of a one - dimensional jet where all quantities depend only on radius @xmath22 ; in what follows , the temperature of the matter is assumed to be zero , and @xmath23 . as in the general axisymmetric case , it is convenient to describe the magnetic - field structure in terms of magnetic - flux function @xmath24 , which is related to the longitudinal magnetic field by b_z()=. [ 6 ]    accordingly , it is convenient to write the toroidal magnetic field , the electric field , and the 4-velocity vector of the matter as b_()=- , [ 7 ] = - , [ 8 ] = + _ f , [ 9 ] where @xmath25 is the total current within @xmath26 . in the case of a cold plasma , at the cylindrical magnetic surfaces @xmath27 , four `` integrals of motion ''  @xcite can be introduced , which should be considered precisely as functions of magnetic flux @xmath28 in the most general statement .",
    "these are primarily @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the definitions  ( [ 8 ] ) and  ( [ 9 ] ) , as well as the @xmath31-component of angular momentum @xmath32 and the energy flux @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 is the relativistic specific enthalpy , which is equal to the mass of particles for a cold plasma .",
    "the specific form of the integrals of motion must be determined from boundary conditions in the compact source and from critical conditions at the singular surfaces .    as a result ,",
    "the equilibrium equation for magnetic surfaces far from gravitating bodies ( grad  shafranov s equation ) can be written as ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) ( ) + _ f()^2 + ( ) -=0 , [ 10 ] where @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the square of the mach number with respect to the alfven velocity @xmath39 , and the derivative @xmath40 acts only on the integrals of motion .",
    "the remaining jet parameters are given by the well - known algebraic relations ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) : @xmath41    equation  ( [ 10 ] ) contains four integrals of motion ; this equation has no singularity at the fast magnetosonic surface , because it depends only on coordinate @xmath22 . as for the alfven surface , @xmath42 , the problem of the boundary conditions generally requires a further study beyond the theory of ideal magnetohydrodynamics . at the same time , for the fairly large currents @xmath43 considered here , a solution continuous across this surface can always be constructed by a small change in the integrals of motion near the alfven surface , @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , equation  ( [ 10 ] ) requires six boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions primarily include the external uniform magnetic field b_z(r_j)=b_ext , [ 14 ] and the regularity condition at the magnetic axis @xmath45 @xmath46    in addition , all four integrals @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 must be specified . as for the remaining quantities characterizing the flow , such as the jet radius @xmath20 and the outflowing plasma energy ,",
    "they must be determined as a solution of the problem formulated above .",
    "similarly , the solution of the problem must also give an answer to the question of whether the flow in the jet is supersonic .",
    "let us now consider the determination of the integrals of motion in more detail",
    ". it would be natural to assume that , at the jet boundary where there is no longitudinal motion of the matter , all four integrals of motion become zero _",
    "f(_0 ) = 0 , e(_0 ) = 0 , l(_0 ) = 0 , ( _ 0 ) = 0 .",
    "[ 16 ] here , @xmath3 is the finite total magnetic flux concentrated in the jet .",
    "this case corresponds to the absence of tangential discontinuities at the jet boundary ; according to  ( [ 11 ] ) , the total electric current within the jet is automatically equal to zero .",
    "we use the integrals of motion @xmath29 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 derived by beskin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the force - free magnetosphere of a black hole , which satisfy the conditions  ( [ 16 ] ) and , consequently , can be directly used to study the jet structure .",
    "the only but very important change here is the fact that , for a finite magnetization parameter @xmath53  @xcite , = , [ 17 ] which tends to infinity in the force - free approximation , the particle contribution must be added to the energy integral @xmath54 , because the energy flux of the electromagnetic field near the rotation axis must inevitably vanish .",
    "as a result , we have with accuracy up to @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 below , we assume , for simplicity , that @xmath59    we emphasize that @xmath60 in expression  ( [ 20 ] ) has the meaning of the injection lorentz factor in the region of the compact object and it is not equal to the lorentz factor of the jet particles .",
    "thus , we see from the formula for the energy flux @xmath54 that the contribution by the electromagnetic field becomes dominant only at @xmath61 , where @xmath62    at low values of @xmath28 , most of the energy is transferred by the relativistic particles ; as directly follows from relation  ( [ 20 ] ) , their lorentz factor is constant and equal to their initial value @xmath60 . as for the integral @xmath30 , the particle - to - magnetic flux ratio , we chose it in the form ( ) = _ 0(1-/_0 ) , [ 23 ] which satisfies the condition  ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the very possibility of using the integrals of motion obtained by analyzing the inner magnetospheric regions , is not trivial . indeed ,",
    "the flow outside the fast magnetosonic surface is completely determined by four boundary conditions at the surface of a rotating body . at the same time , a one - dimensional flow can be produced by the interaction with the external medium , which gives rise ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) to perturbations or shock waves propagating from `` acute angles '' and other irregularities .",
    "therefore , in regions where the conditions for the validity of ideal magnetohydrodynamics are violated , a significant redistribution of energy @xmath48 and angular momentum @xmath49 is possible ( e.g.  a part of them can be lost via radiation ) .",
    "nevertheless , we assume here , for simplicity , that the integrals of motion @xmath54 and @xmath63 , functions of flux @xmath28 , remain exactly the same as those in the inner magnetospheric regions .    in the one - dimensional case we consider ,",
    "it is convenient to reduce the second - order equation  ( [ 10 ] ) to a set of two first - order equations for @xmath24 and @xmath64 . multiplying equation  ( [ 10 ] ) by @xmath65",
    ", we obtain + a()^2 + ( ) -(^2 ^ 2)=0 , [ 24 ] with the derivative @xmath66 acting only on the integrals of motion . finally , we use `` bernoulli s relativistic equation '' @xmath67 , which , given the definitions of the integrals of motion @xmath54 and @xmath63 , can be written as a^2()^2= + - - , [ 25 ] where we introduced the dimensionless variables @xmath68    as a result , substituting the right - hand part of  ( [ 25 ] ) into the first term of  ( [ 24 ] ) and performing differentiation , we obtain the first first - order differential equation @xmath69\\frac{dm^2}{dx}= \\frac{m^6}{x^3a}\\frac{\\omega_{\\rm f}^2(0)l^2}{\\mu^2\\eta^2}- \\frac{xm^2}{a}\\frac{\\omega_{\\rm f}^2}{\\omega_{\\rm f}^2(0 ) } \\left(\\frac{e^2}{\\mu^2\\eta^2}-2a\\right ) \\nonumber",

    "\\label{28}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the second first - order differential equation is bernoulli s equation  ( [ 25 ] ) , which should now be considered as an equation for the derivative @xmath70 .",
    "the set of equations  ( [ 25 ] ) and  ( [ 28 ] ) allows a general solution to be constructed for a one - dimensional jet immersed in an external magnetic field .",
    "we emphasize one important advantage of the set of first - order equations  ( [ 25 ] ) and  ( [ 28 ] ) over the initial second - order equation  ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the point is that the relativistic equation  ( [ 10 ] ) , which is basically the force balance equation , contains the electromagnetic force _ em = _ e*e * + * j * , [ 29 ] in which the electric and magnetic contributions virtually cancel each other far out from the rotation axis @xmath71 . using bernoulli s equation  ( [ 25 ] )",
    ", we can derive  @xcite ~. [ 30 ]    when analyzing  ( [ 10 ] ) , we therefore must retain all higher order terms @xmath72 , while the zero - order quantities @xmath73 and @xmath74 in  ( [ 28 ] ) are analytically removed using bernoulli s equation , so all terms of this equation are of the same order .    finally , it is also important that the exact equation  ( [ 28 ] ) has no singularity near the rotation axis .",
    "in other words , its solution contains no @xmath75-shaped current @xmath76 flowing along the jet axis ; several authors pointed out to the necessity of it  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the basic properties of the set of equations  ( [ 25 ] ) and  ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "as can be easily verified , in the relativistic case under consideration , we may assume @xmath77 with high accuracy .",
    "far from the rotation axis , @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) , equation  ( [ 25 ] ) can be rewritten in the limit @xmath80 as @xmath81 or , equivalently , @xmath82    as we see , equation  ( [ 31 ] ) does not contain @xmath83 at all and can therefore be integrated independently",
    ". this must be the case , because equation  ( [ 31 ] ) must coincide with the asymptotics of the force - free equation , which can be derived from  ( [ 25 ] ) by going to the limit @xmath84 .",
    "assuming now that @xmath85 in  ( [ 32 ] ) , we obtain , in particular , for the jet radius @xmath86    consequently , the jet radius is determined by the limit of the @xmath87 ratio as @xmath88 . in particular , for @xmath54 and @xmath29 given by  ( [ 18])([20 ] ) , we have @xmath89 so the limit  ( [ 33 ] ) does actually exist . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath90 which essentially coincides with estimate  ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "this is no surprise , because we show below that equations  ( [ 25 ] ) and  ( [ 28 ] ) for the integrals of motion  ( [ 18 ] ) ,  ( [ 20 ] ) , and  ( [ 23 ] ) have a constant magnetic field as their solution over a wide range of @xmath22 .",
    "let us now consider in more details the behavior of the solution in the inner jet region , where @xmath91 and , hence , the integrals of motion can be approximately written as @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 . as a result , @xmath95 , and we can rewrite equations  ( [ 25 ] ) and  ( [ 28 ] ) as @xmath96 @xmath97    equations  ( [ 39 ] ) and  ( [ 40 ] ) describing the internal jet structure can be solved analytically .",
    "it can be verified by direct substitution that we have the following asymptotics for @xmath98 : m^2(x ) = m_0 ^ 2 = const , [ 41 ] y(x ) = x^2 , [ 42 ] which correspond to a constant magnetic field b_z = b_z(0)= = b(r_l ) = const , [ 43 ] where @xmath99 . here , we assume that @xmath100 , which is the typical for jets from agns and radio pulsars .",
    "the solution of  ( [ 39 ] ) and  ( [ 40 ] ) for @xmath101 , i.e. , at @xmath79 , depends on the relationship between @xmath60 and @xmath102 .",
    "for example , at @xmath103 , when , according to  ( [ 43 ] ) , the axial magnetic field is fairly weak , the total magnetic flux within @xmath104 @xmath105 can be written as @xmath106 where the flux @xmath107 is given by  ( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "we see that , if the condition @xmath103 is satisfied , then the total magnetic flux within @xmath104 is lower than @xmath107 ; so , outside this region , the particles also make the main contribution to @xmath54 as before , while the contribution of the electromagnetic field may be neglected . as a result , at @xmath79 , the solution of  ( [ 39 ] ) and  ( [ 40 ] ) has a quadratic rise of @xmath83 and a power - law falloff of the magnetic field  @xcite : m^2(x ) = m_0 ^ 2x^2 , [ 46 ] @xmath108    consequently , the magnetic flux increases very slowly ( logarithmically ) with the distance from the rotation axis : @xmath109    such a behavior of the magnetic field , in turn , shows that the transition flux @xmath110 is reached exponentially far from the rotation axis , in conflict with the estimate  ( [ 2 ] ) corresponding to the assumption of jet collimation .",
    "we may thus conclude that an external constant magnetic field limits the mach number at the rotation axis above @xmath111    accordingly , as follows from  ( [ 43 ] ) , the magnetic field at the rotation axis can not be weaker than @xmath112    if , however , the mach number at the rotation axis does not exceed @xmath60 ( i.e.  if @xmath113 ) , then , as for the similar asymptotics @xmath114 , the solution of  ( [ 39 ] ) and  ( [ 40 ] ) for @xmath115 gives a constant magnetic field  ( [ 43 ] ) , which corresponds to the solution y(x ) = x^2 . [",
    "51 ]    at the same time , in this case , we have only a linear increase in the square of the mach number m^2(x ) = m_0 ^ 2x^2 . [ 52 ]    then , according to  ( [ 27 ] ) and  ( [ 51 ] ) , the jet radius can be written as @xmath116 which is equivalent to  ( [ 35 ] ) [ and in agreement with  ( [ 2 ] ) ] .",
    "moreover , as can be easily verified , the constant magnetic field @xmath117 for the invariants  ( [ 18])([20 ] ) proves to be an exact solution of  ( [ 31 ] ) in the entire jet up to the jet boundary , @xmath118 . here",
    ", we may therefore assume @xmath119 .",
    "consequently , according to  ( [ 43 ] ) , we obtain m_0 ^ 2 = .",
    "[ 54 ]    using relation  ( [ 54 ] ) , we can also express all the remaining jet parameters in terms of the external magnetic field .",
    "note that the absence of a declining solution @xmath18 [ see  ( [ 4 ] ) ] is associated with the first term in the right - hand part of  ( [ 28 ] ) proportional to @xmath120 .",
    "this term , which changes appreciably the behavior of the solution , appears to be missed previously . as it was already emphasized above",
    ", this is not surprising because the corresponding term in the second - order equation  ( [ 10 ] ) is of high order and small . on the other hand , far from the rotation axis @xmath121 , equation  ( [ 28 ] )",
    "can be rewritten as + l^2 = 0 , [ 55 ] in which both terms are of the same order . neglecting the term proportional to @xmath120 , we arrive at the solution  ( [ 46 ] ) , @xmath122 , for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the conservation of function h = [ 56 ] was first found by heyvaerts and norman  @xcite for conical solutions , when all quantities depend only on spherical coordinate @xmath125 , but has also been repeatedly discussed when analyzing cylindrical flows .",
    "however , as we see , @xmath126 is generally not conserved in the cylindrical geometry for relativistic jets . to be more precise , the second term in  ( [ 55 ] )",
    "turns out to be significant for all models with a nearly constant density of the longitudinal electric current in the central jet region , where the invariant @xmath63 linearly increases with magnetic flux @xmath28 if @xmath127 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the solution with a central core  ( [ 4 ] ) can not be realized in the presence of an external medium with a finite regular magnetic field .",
    "this conclusion appears to be also valid in the presence of a medium with finite pressure @xmath128 .",
    "indeed , since the magnetic flux  ( [ 48 ] ) increases very slowly ( logarithmically ) , the solution  ( [ 4 ] ) yields an exponentially large jet radius @xmath129 .",
    "accordingly , the magnetic energy density must also be low at @xmath130 .",
    "however , this configuration can not exist in the presence of an external medium with finite pressure @xmath128 , irrespective of whether it is produced by a magnetic field or by a plasma .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the solutions with a central core can be realized only for a special choice of the integral @xmath63 , which increases only slightly with the magnetic flux , and only in the absence of an external medium .",
    "for the most natural ( from our point of view ) models with a constant current density in the central jet regions , the solution with a central core can not be realized even in the absence of an external medium .    in order to derive now the energy distribution in the jet and the particle lorentz factor , it is convenient to introduce the quantity g(x)=. [ 57 ]    since at large distances @xmath79 , according to  ( [ 12 ] ) , we have = , [ 58 ] @xmath131 is simply the ratio of the energy flux transferred by particles @xmath132 to the energy flux of the electromagnetic field . as a result , from relation  (",

    "naturally , such a simple asymptotics can also be derived from simpler considerations . indeed , using the `` frozen - in '' equation @xmath138",

    "it thus follows that , for example , for electron  positron jets from agns , the jet particle energy is typically @xmath142    on the other hand , according to  ( [ 57 ] ) , we reach a very important conclusion that , far from the light cylinder , @xmath143 , @xmath144    consequently , according to  ( [ 58 ] ) , the particle contribution to the general energy flux balance proves to be minor .",

    "this implies that , at @xmath164 , the particles must be additionally accelerated during the collimation coupled with the interaction of the outflowing plasma with the external medium . if , alternatively , @xmath167 , then , in the inner jet regions , at @xmath168 the particle energy on a given field line turns out to be even lower than that for a monopole magnetic field , as shown in figure  [ fig_2](b ) .",
    "the latter result can be easily explained .",
    "indeed , for the integrals of motion  ( [ 36])([38 ] ) we consider , the factor @xmath169 , whose zero value determines the location of the fast mhd surface ( see  @xcite for more detail ) , can be rewritten in the case of a cold plasma as @xmath170    it is easy to show that expression  ( [ 76 ] ) for @xmath161 and @xmath83 given by  ( [ 51 ] ) and  ( [ 52 ] ) is negative at @xmath171 i.e. , at @xmath154 corresponding to  ( [ 75 ] ) .",
    "consequently , we may reach another important conclusion that , for sufficiently strong external magnetic fields @xmath167  ( [ 73 ] ) when @xmath172 , a region with a subsonic flow inevitably emerges in the inner jet regions @xmath173 , where @xmath174^{3/2}r_{\\rm l}. \\label{78}\\ ] ] at the same time , a region with the subsonic flow can be produced far from the compact object either by a shock wave or by a strong distortion of the magnetic field within the fast magnetosonic surface located in the vicinity of the compact object . in both cases ,",
    "the magnetic - field perturbation causes the particle energy to decrease .",
    "thus , we conclude that the exact equilibrium equations  ( [ 25 ] ) and  ( [ 28 ] ) do actually allow a construction of a self - consistent model for a jet immersed in an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "the advantage of these equations over equation  ( [ 10 ] ) results from the fact that all terms in  ( [ 28 ] ) are of the same order . in this case , the uniformity of the poloidal magnetic field within the jet  ( [ 43 ] ) results from the choice of integrals  ( [ 36])([38 ] ) . in general , the poloidal magnetic field depends on the specific form of the integrals .",
    "a full analysis of the possible solutions is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have shown that the fraction of energy transferred by particles @xmath175 must be largely determined by the parameters of the external medium . in case @xmath176 , where @xmath177^{1/2 } , \\label{79}\\ ] ] the energy transferred by particles is only a small fraction of the energy flux @xmath178 transferred by the electromagnetic field .",
    "consequently , the jet is strongly magnetized ( @xmath179 ) only at sufficiently large @xmath53 .",
    "if , however , the magnetization parameter does not exceed @xmath180 , then , in this case , an appreciable part of the energy in the jet is transferred by particles .",
    "this , in turn , implies that a considerable part of the energy must be transferred from the electromagnetic field to the plasma particles during jet collimation .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath180 turns out to be approximately the same both for agns and for fast radio pulsars : _ cr 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 6 .",
    "[ 80 ]    we have shown that the central part of the jet must be subsonic for sufficiently strong external magnetic fields . thus , the theory gives direct predictions whose validity can be verified by observations .",
    "it should also be noted that the results obtained above are applicable both to electron  positron and to electron  proton jets .",
    "however , a direct evidence that the jets in agns are actually electron ",
    "positron ones has recently appeared  @xcite .    in our view , an important result is that , if the external regular magnetic field is taken into account , the mhd equations allow a self - consistent model to be constructed for a jet with a zero total longitudinal electric current , @xmath181 . in this case , a uniform magnetic field that matches the external magnetic field can also be a solution for the inner jet regions . as was already emphasized above , the radii of the jets from agns can thus be also explained in a natural way .",
    "in addition , since only a small fraction of the electromagnetic - field energy is transformed into the particle energy , the energy transfer from the compact object in the region of energy release can be explained as well .",
    "at the same time , extending the mhd solution to the jet region requires very high particle energies ( @xmath182 ) , which have not been recorded yet .",
    "however , a consistent discussion of the outflowing - plasma energy requires a proper allowance for the particle interaction with the surrounding medium ( for example , with background radiation ) , which may cause a significant change in particle energy .    as for the quantitative predictions about the real physical parameters of jets , they , as we showed above , essentially depend only on the following three quantities : the magnetization parameter @xmath53  ( [ 17 ] ) , the lorentz factor @xmath60 in the generation region , and the external magnetic field @xmath183 . in this case , the main uncertainty for electron  positron jets from agns ( @xmath9 , @xmath184 ) is the value of the magnetization parameter .",
    "indeed , this quantity depends on the efficiency of pair production in the magnetosphere of a black hole , which , in turn , is determined by the density of hard gamma - ray photons . as a result ,",
    "if the density of hard gamma - ray photons with energies @xmath185 near the black hole is high enough , then the particles will be produced by direct collisions of photons @xmath186  @xcite .",
    "this causes an abrupt increase in the multiplicity parameter @xmath187@xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the characteristic particle density required to shield the longitudinal electric field . using the well - known estimate ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) @xmath190 we obtain @xmath191    on the other hand , for low densities of gamma - ray photons when an electron  positron plasma can be produced only in regions with a nonzero longitudinal electric field , which are equivalent to the outer gaps in the magnetospheres of radio pulsars  @xcite , the multiplicity of the particle production is fairly small : @xmath192@xmath193 . in this case",
    ", we obtain @xmath194    finally , for fast crab- or vela - type radio pulsars ( @xmath195 , polar - cap radius @xmath196 , and @xmath197 ) in which jets are observed , we have  @xcite @xmath198    relations  ( [ 82 ] ) and  ( [ 83 ] ) show that the properties of the jets from agns considerably depend on the magnetization parameter @xmath53 .",
    "for example , according to  ( [ 79 ] ) , the jet particles for sources with large @xmath199 transfer only a small fraction of the energy compared to the electromagnetic flux , so the flow within the jet differs only slightly from the force - free flow .",
    "in addition , in this case the external magnetic field @xmath200 exceeds the critical magnetic field @xmath201 . according to  ( [ 43 ] ) and  ( [ 73 ] )",
    ", this implies that a subsonic region must exist in the inner regions of such jets . on the other hand ,",
    "a substantial part of the energy in sources with magnetization parameter @xmath202 during jet collimation must be transferred by plasma particles , and no subsonic region is formed near the rotation axis . as for the fast radio pulsars , the condition @xmath203 is satisfied for them , so a subsonic region in the central parts of pulsar jets is not achieved either . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimate  ( [ 79 ] ) shows that an appreciable part of the jet total energy must be coupled with particles .",
    "we emphasize that , since the jet radius  ( [ 53 ] ) for agns always exceeds the light - cylinder radius by several orders of magnitude , @xmath204 the toroidal magnetic field @xmath205 within the jet must exceed the poloidal magnetic field @xmath206 in the same proportion , @xmath207    consequently , detection of such a strong toroidal component would be a crucial argument for the picture discussed here .",
    "unfortunately , determination of the actual physical conditions in jets currently involves considerable difficulties .",
    "nevertheless , not only data on the direct detection of such a structure  @xcite but also evidence for the existence of magnetic fields @xmath208 , closely matching the estimate  ( [ 86 ] )  @xcite , have recently appeared .",
