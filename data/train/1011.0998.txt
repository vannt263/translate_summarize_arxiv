    "interesting processes in physics are frequently associated with nonequilibrium situations . for instance , for a device to do some work an energy current must flow .",
    "the state of the system is therefore a nonequilibrium one .",
    "it is clearly desirable to understand nonequilibrium physics , unfortunately , as opposed to equilibrium physics , no general theory of nonequilibrium processes exists , for instance , for their stationary distribution . for equilibrium systems on the other hand",
    "the invariant equilibrium distribution is well known .",
    "the main difference between equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems is that in an equilibrium a principle of detailed balance holds , stating that the net flow of probability between any two states @xmath1 and @xmath2 is zero .",
    "that is , in equilibrium the probability to go from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is equal to the probability to go from @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "this simple rule greatly simplifies the analysis . in a stationary nonequilibrium situation on the other hand ,",
    "only the total probability flow out of a state @xmath1 has to be zero and not along each connection individually . in view of the lack of general theory",
    "it would be desirable to find some exact solutions for nonequilibrium situations , from which we could perhaps draw some generic rules .",
    "particularly simple are nonequilibrium states that do not change in time , also called nonequilibrium stationary states ( ness ) .    in classical physics",
    "there are a number of exactly solvable nonequilibrium models , most notably various stochastic lattice gasses described by exclusion processes  @xcite .",
    "the picture is quite different in quantum physics .",
    "there are hardly any analytically solvable models known , see though for instance an example of a single spin coupled to a bath in a star configuration  @xcite .",
    "an exception of solvable models are those that are quadratic in the fermionic variables .",
    "one possibility for studying ness is to take an infinite system in which an infinite sub - part serves as a bath .",
    "such was the case in the doubly infinite xy chain studied in  @xcite .",
    "the other approach is to write an effective master equation that describes the evolution of only the central system without baths .",
    "the simplest master equation is the lindblad equation , which can be diagonalized if the superoperator ( a generator of a markovian flow ) is a quadratic function of fermi onic operators  @xcite , giving the exact solution for the ness  @xcite .    in the present work we are going to find a solution for quantum ness in a system whose",
    "lindblad superoperator @xmath3 ( eq.[eq : lin ] ) is not a quadratic function of fermions but is , nevertheless , simple enough to enable an explicit solution .",
    "some parts of the solution have been presented in recent refs .",
    "@xcite , while the same model has been numerically studied in  @xcite .",
    "the model we are going to study is the xx chain with a local dephasing at each site and coupled to nonequilibrium baths . a nonequilibrium xx model without dephasing",
    "was solved in  @xcite , for a compact solution see also  @xcite .",
    "besides providing an explicit solution we also show that it is fundamentally different from those in quadratic systems .",
    "namely , the wick theorem does not hold and the ness is not gaussian .",
    "another interesting aspect is that in a certain thermodynamic or weak driving limit the solution can be written as a matrix product operator ( mpo ) with matri ces of small fixed dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this extends the mpo solution obtained for the ness in a model without dephasing  @xcite .",
    "the applicability of a matrix product ansatz has important implications for the properties of the system as well as for numerical methods that can be used to calculate ness .",
    "it has been known for some time that the matrix product ansatz can describe ground states of certain 1-dimensional systems  @xcite , ness of classical exclusion models  @xcite , and is a rather useful concept in quantum information and numerical methods used to simulate quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "a mpo ansatz of small fixed dimension can describe the time evolution of certain operators in integrable systems  @xcite .",
    "the mpo solution presented here extends the applicability of a mpo ansatz to nesss in non - quadratic systems .    the final section deals with phase transitions in nonequilibrium stationary states .",
    "it is shown that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition at zero dephasing , going from the ness that is gaussian and displays a ballistic transport , to the ness that is non - gaussian , shows diffusive spin transport , and exhibits long - range correlations for nonzero dephasing .",
    "we show that the characteristic feature of the phase transition point is a faster closing of the gap of the superoperator with the system size than away from the phase transition .",
    "this seems to be a general property of nonequilibrium phase transitions , see recent studies in refs .",
    "the hamiltonian of the xx spin chain in a homogeneous magnetic field is given by @xmath4 with standard pauli matrices .",
    "an exact evolution of a central system , like the xx chain in our case , which is coupled to environment is in general complicated .",
    "however , if the environment correlation time is sufficiently small , i.e. , so that it has no `` memory '' , and the evolution has a property of the semigroup , then the reduced evolution of the central system can be described by the lindblad equation  @xcite , @xmath5 + { \\cal l}^{\\rm dis}(\\rho)={\\cal l}(\\rho ) .",
    "\\label{eq : lin}\\ ] ] the dissipative linear operator @xmath6 can be written in terms of lindblad operators @xmath7 , @xmath8 + [ l_k,\\rho l_k^{\\dagger } ] \\right).\\ ] ] the lindblad master equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) can describe the most general completely positive trace preserving map that is a dynamical semigroup , i.e. , a map that is a semigroup for a continuous time parameter .",
    "while the complete positivity must arguably be satisfied by any evolution , the semigroup property can be violated when the environment has a `` memory '' that causes a back - action on the central system .",
    "the model we study here has two different dissipative parts .",
    "one describee the action of two baths , inducing a nonequilibrium situation if they are different , while the other describes a local dephasing at each site , for instance , being due to the coupling of each site to unobservable degrees of freedom .",
    "the lindblad dissipator is therefore a sum of two terms , @xmath9 the dephasing part @xmath10 is a sum of @xmath11 , each of which acts only on the @xmath12-th site and is described by a single lindblad operator , @xmath13 sometimes it is useful to write a matrix representation of the dissipative superoperator @xmath11 . if we use a basis of pauli matrices and we order them as @xmath14 , we have a matrix representation @xmath15 dephasing with strength @xmath16 causes an exponential decay of the off - diagonal elements of a density matrix , if we write it in the diagonal basis of @xmath17 . using jordan - wigner transformation , such basis corresponds to the number basis of spinless fermions . note that it is precisely the dephasing term which makes the superoperator non - quadratic , in fact quartic , in fermionic operators .",
    "namely , the superoperator @xmath18 is quadratic in the lindblad operator @xmath19 which is itself quadratic in fermionic operators .    for the dissipative bath part @xmath20 we shall take the simplest possible lindblad operators that are still able to describe a nonequilibrium situation",
    "first , they are going to act locally only on the first and the last spin , and second , there will be only two operators at each end .",
    "writing the dissipative part @xmath21 as a sum of a part acting only at the left end ( site index @xmath22 and label `` l '' ) and a part acting only at the right end ( site index @xmath23 and label `` r '' ) , we have @xmath24 + [ l_k^{\\rm l , r},\\rho l_k^{{\\rm l , r}\\dagger } ] \\right)$ ] .",
    "the two lindblad operators at the left end are @xmath25 while on the right end we have @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the matrix representation of both superoperators is @xmath28 such simple local lindbald operators involving @xmath29 and @xmath30 are often used when studying transport in spin chains , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 play the role of a coupling strength , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 determine the magnetization that the bath tries to impose on the chain ends . to see that this is indeed the case one can look for a stationary state of the bath @xmath35 dissipator only .",
    "that is , we look for a single - spin state @xmath36 that satisfies @xmath37 .",
    "one easily finds that @xmath38 and therefore @xmath39 .",
    "the chosen bath is therefore such that it tries to induce a local magnetization of size @xmath40 at the left end and @xmath41 at the right end ( these two parameters can be thought of as magnetizations of an infinite bath to which the central system is coupled ) .",
    "of course , the nonequilibrium stationary state of the whole master equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) , which in addition includes a unitary part and a dephasing , will have a slightly different magnetization at the ends .",
    "one can also invert the problem and ask , is it possible to choose lindblad operators that will target an arbitrary stationary state @xmath36 of @xmath20 , even on many qubits ?",
    "the answer is positive with the explicit procedure given in  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to analytically find the ness of the master equation ( [ eq : lin ] ) .",
    "this state , simply denoted by @xmath42 in the following , is an eigenstate of the lindblad superoperator with an eigenvalue of @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "as shown in ref  @xcite , when @xmath45 the solution , i.e. the ness , can be sought in the form of a series in powers of the driving @xmath33 . while a perturbative expansion is always possible , our solution is different .",
    "it is nonperturbative due to the special algebraic structure .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail later .",
    "the ansatz for the ness is @xmath46 as we shall see , the term @xmath47 is of the order @xmath48 and there is a closed set of equations that give @xmath47 . the solution can therefore be obtained term by term , without having to to deal with the whole set of exponentially many equations .",
    "we are first going to discuss the case with the zero bath magnetization offset , @xmath45 .",
    "the non - zero case will then be obtained as a simple modification of the solution for @xmath45 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the solution @xmath42 is a sum of terms , where each is a product of operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 at different sites .",
    "@xmath51 is a spin current operator .",
    "this simple structure is a consequence of the fact , that all other operators , that could result in @xmath51 or @xmath49 when operated on by @xmath3 , are zero .",
    "the ness can therefore be sought within the algebra of @xmath49 and @xmath51 . before actually going to the solution itself ,",
    "let us discuss the role of a homogeneous magnetic field of strength @xmath52 .",
    "the action of a single @xmath53 term in the hamiltonian is simple .",
    "the matrix of the superoperator @xmath54 has only two nonzero elements .",
    "they are @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , while all other are zero , @xmath57 . because the ness is a sum of products of only @xmath58 and currents @xmath51 , and because for homogeneous field we have @xmath59 as well as @xmath60 , the ness for zero field , @xmath61 , is also an exact solution for arbitrary nonzero field @xmath62 . in short ,",
    "the homogeneous magnetic field has no influence on the ness .",
    "let us briefly argue why the ness can be calculated term by term in the expansion over @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : series ] ) , and why the set of equations for each term is closed . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath45 .",
    "a key is a simple algebra generated by various superoperators in the master equation .",
    "the dephasing term acts as @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as well as @xmath65 .",
    "the bath at the left end acts as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the bath at the right end . the unitary part due to @xmath69 acts as @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "note that t here are no overlapping products of operators in @xmath42 .",
    "the condition that there are no products of operators at the same site , i.e. , either @xmath73 or @xmath74 , ensures that the explicit normalization of @xmath42 by @xmath75 is not broken ( [ eq : series ] ) .",
    "other terms not present due to hermiticity are @xmath76 and @xmath77 ; note however that @xmath78 are allowed . from the action of superoperators we note two things : ( i ) if @xmath79 is a sum of operators , each of which is a product of non - overlapping @xmath49 and @xmath51 , then @xmath80 is again a sum of non - overlapping @xmath49 and @xmath51 ; and ( ii ) the number of operators @xmath49 and @xmath51 in each term is preserved by the action of @xmath81 and @xmath18 .",
    "the only superoperator that does not conserve the number of operators is that of the bath , which can create @xmath17 out of an identity .",
    "these two observations are crucial .",
    "let us now write our solution @xmath42 as a series in @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : series ] ) , where the @xmath82-th order term is a sum of all possible non - overlapping products , where each is a product of exactly @xmath82 operators @xmath49 or @xmath51 ( here we always mean the number of non - identity operators ) .",
    "we put all ( unknown ) coefficients appearing in the term @xmath47 in a set @xmath83 .",
    "for instance ,",
    "the set @xmath84 has only one coefficient , namely a known normalization @xmath75 in front of @xmath85 , the set @xmath86 consists of @xmath87 unknown coefficients in front of @xmath49 and @xmath88 unknown coefficients in front of @xmath51 .",
    "the ness must satisfy the equation @xmath44 , therefore , the coefficient in fron t of each operator appearing in @xmath89 must be zero . if we look at the coefficient in front of an operator that is a product of @xmath82 non - identity operators , then this coefficient is a linear function of coefficients in the set @xmath90 and coefficients in the set @xmath91 ( these come from the action of the bath @xmath20 ) .",
    "this structure enables us to solve for @xmath47 , i.e. , coefficients in @xmath90 , iteratively , starting with known @xmath84 .",
    "note that the only coefficient in @xmath84 is equal to @xmath92 . using",
    "this known @xmath84 we can now write a set of linear equations for coefficients in @xmath86 , where the coefficient from @xmath84 will act as a source term , i.e. , an inhomogeneous part of equations . because when @xmath20 makes a term of type @xmath93 from @xmath90 , it always multiplies it by @xmath33 , the source term will scale as @xmath94 . therefore , all coefficients in @xmath86 are proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "iteratively repeating the procedure we see that , ( i ) coefficients in @xmath90 scale as @xmath48 , that is the terms in @xmath47 indeed scale as @xmath48 , and ( ii ) at each order we have to solve a closed set of equations for coefficients in @xmath90 .",
    "these determine all @xmath82-point correlations in the ness . helping ourselves for the moment with the solution for the first three orders given in the following",
    ", we can say even more .",
    "if one writes equations for @xmath82-point connected correlations , instead of for non - connected ones , we can also predict how the source term at the @xmath82-th order scales with the number of spins @xmath87 . using equations from the previous order @xmath91",
    "one can see that the source term scales as @xmath96 . in the following",
    "we shall see that the spin current , the coefficient of which is denoted by @xmath97 , scales in the same way .",
    "therefore , the source terms scale as the @xmath82-th power of the current , @xmath98 .",
    "a consequence of this is that the largest co nnected term in @xmath47 scales as @xmath99 and comes from the connected correlation of @xmath82 operators @xmath49 .",
    "the largest non - connected term in @xmath47 on the other hand scales as @xmath100 and comes from the product of @xmath82 operators @xmath49 , see also the explicitly ansatz below .",
    "we are now going to find an explicit form of the first three orders .",
    "for special values of parameters , the solution for the first two orders has been presented in  @xcite .",
    "let us first find the ness for a bath with a zero offset of magnetization , @xmath45 .",
    "it is instructive to first find the equilibrium stationary state in the absence of driving , when @xmath101 . in this case",
    "both baths ( [ eq : lbath ] ) act with @xmath29 and @xmath30 with equal probability , inducing no net magnetization .",
    "in fact , the equilibrium state is very simple and equal to the totally mixed state , @xmath102 this equilibrium state can therefore be thought of as an infinite temperature state .",
    "the ansatz for the first two orders is the following , @xmath103 the spin current operator is @xmath50 .",
    "the 2nd order ansatz is @xmath104 @xmath105 in the solution a specific factor will appear in all expressions for connected correlation functions .",
    "we denote it by the letter @xmath106 , @xmath107 for large @xmath87 it scales as @xmath108 , in fact , for @xmath109 it is equal to @xmath110",
    ". it therefore plays the role of an effective system size .",
    "the solution for the 1st and the 2nd order is found in exactly the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite for specific parameters .",
    "one writes a closed set of equations and solves it .",
    "we do not repeat the details of the derivation here , but just present the solution for general values of parameters .",
    "the 1st order terms are @xmath111 and @xmath112 alternatively , we can express local magnetizations @xmath113 as @xmath114 away from the boundary we have @xmath115 , while @xmath116 .",
    "the expectation value of the magnetization at site @xmath12 is just @xmath117 and of the spin current @xmath118 .",
    "several interesting observations can be made .",
    "our one - spin lindblad bath is constructed in such a way that it targets magnetization @xmath119 on the 1st and the last site . because there are other terms besides the bath in the lindblad equation the actual magnetization in the ness at the boundaries is slightly different .",
    "namely , we have @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "expectedly , one can see that if the coupling strength @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) is very small the difference from the targeted magnetization is large .",
    "second , the magnetizaton difference between two neighboring sites is @xmath122 in the bulk , while it is @xmath123 at the left end and @xmath124 at the right end .",
    "the magnetization profile is theref ore linear , apart from two sites at both ends , where a contact resistance due to @xmath31 and @xmath32 is felt .",
    "one could in fact generalize our solution to allow for an inhomogeneous dephasing @xmath125 at each site .",
    "the difference in the first order solution ( [ eq : a ] ) would be having terms @xmath126 instead of @xmath127 . using @xmath128 and having @xmath129 one",
    "could therefore achieve a perfectly linear profile , without any contact resistance jumps at the boundaries . however , higher order terms in @xmath33 are more complicated in this case ( although of the same form ) and we do not discuss inhomogeneous dephasing in the present work .",
    "the expectation value of the current @xmath130 is maximal for intermediate couplings @xmath131 . keeping the system size and the dephasing strength",
    "@xmath16 fixed , we can see that @xmath97 has a maximum at @xmath109 .",
    "it is equal to @xmath132 .",
    "if the couplings are smaller the current is smaller because the ness is only weakly nonequilibrium due to the weak coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath133s are large the current is again smaller because the hamiltonian part @xmath69 , which transports magnetization , is less important compared to baths .",
    "the dependence of the maximal current on @xmath16 is trivial , the smaller the dephasing the larger is the current .",
    "another observation is that the magnetization difference between the two ends is @xmath134 .",
    "the transport coefficient @xmath135 , defined via @xmath136 , is @xmath137 .",
    "as long as the dephasing is nonzero it asymptotically behaves as @xmath138 and is independent of the system size @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath139 is on the other hand smaller than @xmath140 , for instance if the dephasing is zero , then in the limit of weak coupling , @xmath141 , @xmath135 diverges .",
    "the expressions for the 2nd order terms are rather simple , @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 the connected correlation function of magnetization , @xmath145 is for @xmath146 equal to @xmath147 , while it is equal to @xmath148 for nondiagonal @xmath149 . for large system size @xmath87",
    "the connected correlation function @xmath150 achieves its maximal value at @xmath151 , when a product of @xmath152 is the largest .",
    "we therefore have @xmath153 . the maximum",
    "is again achieved at @xmath109 .",
    "the dependence of the maximal @xmath154 connected correlation on @xmath16 is though the opposite of that of the current . here",
    "the correlations monotonously increase with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "the 3rd order terms are obtained in an analogous way .",
    "the calculation is a little tedious , nevertheless , we managed to obtained closed expressions .",
    "detailed results can be found in the appendix  [ app : a ] . at this point",
    "we just list the dominant term for large @xmath87 .",
    "it is a three - point connected correlation of @xmath17 .",
    "away from boundaries and for non - neighboring indices , where the kronecker - delta terms are zero , the general expression ( [ eq : zzz ] ) simplifies .",
    "for instance , for @xmath155 and @xmath156 it is just @xmath157 where we have introduced rescaled position variables @xmath158 .",
    "the two - point function is for the same parameter values and @xmath159 @xmath160 scaling of the first two connected correlations on @xmath33 and @xmath87 therefore follows a general rule : the @xmath82-point connected correlation function is @xmath161 in accordance with the general discussion in the subsection  [ sec : scaling ] .",
    "the form of these two correlation functions is the same as in some classical exclusion processes  @xcite , for a recent work on an analogous quantum master equation exhibiting some features similar to our model see  @xcite . whether this is only a consequence of the same hydrodynamic limit or whether there perhaps exists an exact mapping from the quantum model to a classical one is unknown at present .",
    "let us now go to the case where there is an offset of magnetization in the baths .",
    "for nonzero @xmath34 the equilibrium state , when @xmath101 , is again simple , although not trivial @xmath163 as in the case of zero @xmath34 .",
    "it is a product state with nonzero magnetization @xmath164 it is therefore a state with all connected correlations being zero ( trivially gaussian state ) apart from nonzero magnetization .",
    "this equilibrium state can be equated to the grandcanonical state @xmath165 , with @xmath166 , having an infinite temperature @xmath167 and a finite chemical potential times the inverse temperature , @xmath168 .",
    "one should note though that integrable systems , such as our xx chain , do not thermalize for generic local lindblad baths  @xcite .",
    "out of equilibrium , when @xmath169 , the solution is actually very similar to the one with zero @xmath34 .",
    "namely , the only thing that changes is the expression for magnetization , @xmath113 , while all other @xmath87-point connected correlations are the same as in the case of no offset , @xmath45 . for nonzero",
    "offset the solution is therefore @xmath170 with the same @xmath171 ( [ eq : kj ] ) as before .",
    "all other terms ( [ eq : b],[eq : c],[eq : zzz],[eq:3rdx],[eq:3rdy ] ) are the same .",
    "in this section we are going to show that the ness obtained above is not gaussian , i.e. , that the wick theorem does not hold . because three - point connected correlation functions are nonzero , see e.g. eq .  ( [ eq : zzz ] ) , it is obvious that the wick theorem does not apply in spin variables .",
    "however , it is not clear that it does not apply in the spinless fermion picture .",
    "a system of spin-@xmath172 particles can be mapped to spinless fermions using the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "denoting by @xmath173 and @xmath174 canonical fermionic annihilation and creation operators , satisfying anticommutators @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , the transformation is given by the mapping @xmath178 or its inverse @xmath179 where we denote by @xmath180 a number ( density ) operator at site @xmath12 . denoting by @xmath181 a string of @xmath82 consecutive @xmath17 , and introducing an energy - density - like operator @xmath182 and a current - like operator @xmath183 , we have @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 . from our solution for the ness ( see also comments in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) ) we can see that expectations of all @xmath187 and @xmath188 , apart from @xmath189 , are zero .",
    "the only nonzero two - point fermionic expectations are therefore @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "an important point is that only on - site or nearest - neighbor two - point fermionic correlations are nonzero .",
    "if the ness would be gaussian and the wick theorem would hold all connected correlations beyond nearest neighbor would have to be zero . because this is not the case the ness is clearly not gaussian .",
    "for instance , rewriting the connected @xmath154 correlation as @xmath192 , and using the wick theorem , we would have @xmath193 .",
    "the last expression is nonzero only if @xmath194 , whereas on the other hand we have long - range correlations with all @xmath150 being nonzero if @xmath195 . the wick theorem",
    "therefore does not hold if @xmath195 .",
    "the ness is non - gaussian and presents an interesting new solvable model .",
    "whether it is nevertheless equivalent to some existing solvable model is at present unknown .",
    "even - though the ness is non - gaussian , it is still , in a sense , weakly correlated , meaning that it can be represented in terms of a matrix product operator ( mpo ) form @xmath196 with matrices of small size .",
    "note that in an mpo formulation a density matrix is treated as an element ( a pure state ) of @xmath197 dimensional hilbert space of operators . for @xmath198 the matrices @xmath199 of finite size @xmath200 that is independent of the system length suffice  @xcite . for nonzero dephasing an exact representation with matrices of fixed size is not possible .",
    "we have numerical indications though that the schmidt rank , i.e. , a number of nonzero schmidt coefficients , for a bipartite cut after the first @xmath201 spins is @xmath202 .",
    "we have verified this conjecture by numerically computing an exact ness for systems of up - to @xmath203 spins . because the schmidt rank is equal to the necessary dimension of matrices in the mpo ansatz",
    ", the exact representation of the ness requires an mpo of dimension @xmath204 .",
    "looking at the series solution for ness ( [ eq : series ] ) we can see that the largest connected term in the @xmath82-th order @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath82-point connected correlation function ) scales for large @xmath87 as @xmath205 and comes from the connected correlation of @xmath82 @xmath17s .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit of large @xmath87 one could neglect all higher order connected correlations , keeping in the ness only the leading terms that scale with @xmath87 as @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "these are magnetization @xmath49 , spin current @xmath51 and @xmath154 connected correlations , as well as their products decaying no faster than @xmath207 that appear in higher order non - connected correlations . because all these terms are already present in an exact mpo solution for @xmath198  @xcite having @xmath200",

    "the two conditions can in fact be put under the same hood . observing that to fulfill @xmath260 in the thermodynamic limit one must necessarily have @xmath245 , and similarly , to have @xmath261 in the weak - driving limit one must necessarily have @xmath244",
    ", one can reformulate both in a single statement , saying that the mpo of dimension @xmath200 ( [ eq : mpo ] ) gives the leading order solution in the limit @xmath244 having at the same time @xmath245 .",
    "another interesting point is that for @xmath243 the second largest schmidt coefficient is independent of @xmath87 and scales as @xmath262 .",
    "this means that despite the fact that our system is at an infinite effective temperature , there is a nonzero bipartite entanglement present , even in the thermodynamic limit of large @xmath87 ( at a fixed @xmath33 ) .",
    "this entanglement at an infinite temperature is of purely nonequilibrium origin .",
    "from the exact solution we can see that the ness undergoes a transition from a state without long - range correlations for @xmath198 , to the one with long - range correlations for @xmath195 . a point in a parameter space where a system undergoes a sudden change in some expectation values",
    "is usually called a phase transition point .",
    "we use the same nomenclature here and call this transition a nonequilibrium phase transition , because the nature of the correlations changes .",
    "transport properties also change suddenly at @xmath198 , going from a ballistic ( superconducting ) state to a diffusive for nonzero dephasing . in the phase with long - range correlations two - point @xmath154 correlations scale as @xmath263  @xcite and are therefore of purely nonequilibrium origin .",
    "they also go to zero in the thermodynamic limit making this transition different than equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "the correlation function has a plateau because in the thermodynamic limit the decay of @xmath264 with the distance between indices @xmath265 gets increasingly slower ( [ eq : plat ] ) .",
    "recently , similar quantum nonequilibrium phase transitions have been discovered in the xy model  @xcite , in which the long - range correlations scale as @xmath263 , in the xxz model with dephasing  @xcite ( the same scaling of the correlation plateau as here ) , as well as in the xxz model without dephasing  @xcite , where though the correlation plateau scales as @xmath266 ( the plateau is independent of @xmath87 ! ) at an infinite temperature and as @xmath267 at a finite temperature .",
    "it has been conjectured that long - range correlations are a generic feature of quantum nonequilibrium steady states  @xcite",
    ".    it would be nice to understand this phase transition more in detail . at equilibrium ,",
    "phase transitions are connected with the nonanaliticity of the free energy , or equivalently , zeros of the partition function .",
    "difficulty with the nonequilibrium situation is that there is no general theory , in particual , free - energy - like quantity whose analytic property could be studied is not known . nevertheless , because observable properties of the system change suddenly at our nonequilibrium phase transition point there must be some underlying nonanalytic property .",
    "we can mention that the lee - yang theory of equilibrium phase transitions has been used with some success on certain classical nonequilibrium systems  @xcite whose stationary state can be represented in a matrix product form . for some classical exclusion processes in the thermodynamic limit",
    "even a free - energy like functional can be calculated  @xcite . until recently  @xcite no quantum stationar y state solvable by matrix product ansatz has been known and the theory of quantum nonequilibrium phase transitions is lagging behind the classical .",
    "for classical nonequilibrium systems a product of all nonzero eigenvalues of a superoperator can play a role of a `` partition '' function , @xmath268 , whose zeros then determine the location of nonequilibrium phase transitions .",
    "it is shown  @xcite that the product of nonzero eigenvalues is equal to a sum of all expansion coefficients of the ness .",
    "there are problems with such an approach though .",
    "the principal difficulty is that @xmath269 is defined only up - to to an arbitrary normalization factor and it is a priori not known which normalization one should take .    in the present work we look for non - analytic signatures in the spectrum of the superoperator , trying to see if there is any characteristic change at the phase transition point . because the ness is an eigenstate of @xmath3 with an eigenvalue zero , a change in the properties of the ness should be connected with the closing of the gap between the second largest eigenvalue and the one of the ness .",
    "if this gap goes to zero there is the possibility for a scenario reminiscent of an avoided - crossing between two eigenenergies happening at a zero - temperature quantum phase transition , where at the crossing the nature of the two levels involved is exchanged . of interest for nonequilibrium phase transitions",
    "is therefore the second largest eigenvalue @xmath270 of the lindblad superoperator @xmath3 , or in particular the gap @xmath271 , @xmath272 .",
    "we note that the size of the gap also determines the decay rate , i.e. , the relaxation rate , to the ness .",
    "namely , the initial nons tationary state will , for large times , relax to the ness as @xmath273 . because we in general expect the relaxation time ,",
    "in the case of local coupling to baths at chain ends , to grow with the system size at least as @xmath274  larger system simply needs more time to relax  , the gap is expected to decrease with @xmath87 , even if we are not at the nonequilibrium phase transition point .",
    "the signature of nonequilibrium phase transition can therefore not be simply the closing of the gap @xmath271 .",
    "what is generally observed though is that the closing of the gap @xmath271 with @xmath87 is at the phase transition point _",
    "faster _ than away from the phase transition point .",
    "such behavior has been observed , for instance , in an open xy chain  @xcite , where at a nonequilibrium phase transition point the gap scales as @xmath275 , while it scales only as @xmath276 away from the transition point .",
    "we therefore studied the scaling of the gap in our model .",
    "th e results can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : gap ] .     and for the system with long - range order in the case of @xmath277 . at the nonequilibrium phase transition point at @xmath198",
    "the gap decays faster , as @xmath276 , than away from the transition point ( @xmath277 ) where @xmath278 .",
    "we also show the scaling of the inverse relaxation time of the magnetization at site @xmath221 ( squares ) .",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath45 and @xmath228.,width=336 ]    we numerically exactly calculated the gap @xmath271 for systems of up - to @xmath279 spins . for larger systems a relaxation time @xmath79 of some observable can be used as an estimate of the gap . using the tdmrg we have solved the lindblad equation in time , thereby obtaining time dependent expectations of observables .",
    "we fitted an exponential function to the relaxation of the magnetization at site @xmath221 , @xmath280 , and determined @xmath79 for systems with up - to @xmath225 spins .",
    "as the second largest eigenvalue @xmath270 is nondegenerate for @xmath277 the relaxation time can serve to estimate the gap through @xmath281 . from the figure",
    "we can see that at the phase transition point the gap scales as @xmath276 .",
    "this of course agrees with a previous analytic result for the isotropic xy chain  @xcite .",
    "away from the nonequilibrium phase transition , at @xmath277 , the gap decays more slowly , as @xmath278 .",
    "we therefor e conjecture that the characteristic feature of nonequilibrium phase transitions is that the gap of the superoperator decays faster at the nonequilibrium phase transition point than in its neighborhood . at a nonequilibrium phase transition point",
    "the relaxation slows down , similary as at an equilibrium phase transition point .",
    "how much faster the gap decays depends on a particular system .",
    "here we have @xmath282 vs. @xmath283 , for the xy model on the other hand one has @xmath284 vs. @xmath282  @xcite .",
    "note that this criterion is different from those used in equilibrium physics as it makes a reference also to the neighborhood of the transition point .",
    "interesting to note is that the relaxation time of the spin current is in our model by about a factor @xmath285 shorter than that of @xmath286 .",
    "the reason must lie in the fact that some of the eigenstates that are just below the ness in the spectrum carry no current .",
    "another observation about the spectrum of the lindblad superopera tor for the xx model with dephasing is that the eigenvalues are independent of the driving @xmath33 , only the eigenvectors depend on @xmath33 .",
    "this probably happens due to the hierarchical structure of the master equation .",
    "we have provided exact expressions for all one - point , two - point and three - point connected correlations in the nonequilibrium stationary state of the xx model with dephasing .",
    "a hierarchical structure of stationary equations is explained , a consequence of which is that equations determining all @xmath87-point correlations form a closed set .",
    "the nonequilibrium stationary state is non - gaussian because the wick theorem does not apply . in the thermodynamic and weak - driving limit",
    "the solution can be written in terms of a matrix product ansatz with matrices of fixed dimension 4 . at zero dephasing",
    "the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition from a state with only nearest - neighbor correlations to a state possessing long - range correlations .",
    "it is conjectured that at a quantum nonequilibrium phase transition point the gap of the superoperator closes with the system size more rapidly than in the vicinity of the transition point .",
