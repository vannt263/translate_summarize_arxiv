    "along with nak and narb , the krb molecule is one of the most extensively studied among the mixed alkalis .",
    "the ground state , the lowest singlet states and some of the triplet states were studied by various spectroscopic techniques .",
    "it is therefore surprising that the triplet state  was not characterized experimentally so far .    in recent years ,",
    "understanding interactions between different alkali - metal species in their singlet and triplet ground states of the pairs became important due to the experiments in mixed atomic traps .",
    "this stimulated investigations of the molecular states as well . using molecular spectroscopy ,",
    "several ground state asymptotes were examined : narb @xcite , nacs @xcite , lics @xcite . in the present study we applied the same technique for krb .",
    "this molecule is particularly interesting since several groups are operating two - species traps , cold krb molecules have been already formed , positions of several feshbach resonances in @xmath0k@xmath1rb have been measured @xcite and new ones are still being searched for . the study of the ( 4s)k+(5s)rb asymptote has therefore several strong motivations : ( i ) to obtain complete and accurate potentials for the  and  states , to be able to model cold collisions ; ( ii ) to prove of the validity of the isotopic scaling rules , i.e. applying the potentials derived for the main isotopic combination @xmath2k@xmath3rb to reproduce the experimental observations ( including the feshbach resonances ) in other isotopes of krb ; ( iii ) to predict new feshbach resonances that can be later verified and precisely measured experimentally with much reduced effort for the search procedure .    along with the theoretical calculations of the long range dispersion coefficients",
    "@xcite there is only one theoretical work yet devoted to the study of the electronic structure of krb @xcite .",
    "the ground state of krb was first studied for v@xmath4 at high resolution by ross and coworkers @xcite .",
    "a significant step towards the asymptote was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an accurate potential energy curve for v@xmath5 up to 87 was derived . in both investigations the laser induced fluorescence to the krb ground state was recorded by exciting the a@xmath6 state by radiation of a ti : sapphire laser .",
    "the b(1)@xmath7 state was studied in refs .",
    "numerous perturbations were observed due to mixing with the nearby lying triplet states .",
    "therefore in order to study the  state it was expected to follow straightforward the strategy which was successfully applied fot the investigation of the same states in narb @xcite and nacs @xcite , i.e. to use the perturbations in the b(1)@xmath7 state as a window to the triplet manifold .",
    "the krb molecules were produced in a stainless steel heat - pipe similar to that developed for narb @xcite and nacs @xcite .",
    "metallic k and rb were mixed in an approximate mass ratio 1:1 .",
    "the heat - pipe was operated typically at a temperature of 550 k with 2 - 5 mbar of ar as buffer gas .",
    "the laser induced fluorescence ( lif ) was excited with narrow band single mode lasers and resolved with a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) bruker 120 hr .    for excitation of the b(1)@xmath7 state we used a coherent 599 linear laser with dcm dye delivering a power of about 70 mw . in the region between 15000  and 15300  we found a lot of transitions in the b - x band system .",
    "along with them , transitions in the similar system of k@xmath8 were often seen with comparable intensity .",
    "going to higher frequencies the transitions in k@xmath8 dominated those in krb .",
    "it is worth noting here , that when we tested a heat - pipe filled only with potassium , the fluorescence due to k@xmath8 at similar experimental conditions ( temperature , laser frequency , laser power ) was at least a factor of 3 stronger than in the krb heat - pipe . obviously in case of mixtures the concentration of molecules",
    "can not be derived simply from the saturated vapour pressure of the correspondent pure metals as often stated in spectroscopic papers .",
    "this is confirmed also by the fact that rb@xmath8 fluorescence was not observed in the studied spectral region , although rb@xmath8 was reported to absorb there @xcite .",
    "the fluorescence from the b state led usually back to the ground  state .",
    "however when exciting a perturbed level with triplet admixture , fluorescence down to the triplet state  was seen as well .",
    "it appeared in the region of 11000 - 12000 well separated from the b - x fluorescence .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ trips],where the fluorescence progression extends close to the dissociation asymptote , which can be concluded from the large decrease of the vibrational spacing below 10950 . when resolved by the fts with a resolution of typically 0.03 most lines to the state",
    "show the expected hyperfine structure ( hfs ) similar to that observed in ref .  @xcite . in those cases",
    "it could be explained by the fermi contact interaction @xcite using the atomic hfs parameters of rb and k @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to the narb and nacs cases @xcite , there was also a large number of progressions all lines of which show unusual hfs ( see fig .",
    "[ hfs ] ) .",
    "this we shall discuss in the following section  [ analysis ] .",
    "the ground state  was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite up to v@xmath5=87 .",
    "the classical outer turning point of the last observed level is about 11.3  .",
    "this value differs from that given in the title of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely 10   , since the latter corresponds to the turning point of the level ( @xmath9=87 , @xmath10=0 ) , but in fact the authors observed that vibrational level for @xmath10=51 which shifts the classical turning point to a larger internuclear distance .",
    "this distance , however is still too small in order to study the coupling between the  and  states due to the hfs mixing .",
    "therefore , we revisited the  state asymptote in order to extend the experimental information closer to the dissociation limit . for this purpose",
    "we excited the - system using a ti : sapphire laser ( from tekhnoscan ) pumped by a 10 w cw frequency doubled nd : yag laser ( coherent verdi 10 ) and repeated as first steps measurements from @xcite for internal calibration check .",
    "then we extended the experimental data set by recording progressions from the same upper vibrational level but with different j@xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that some of the lines of the progression reported in ref .",
    "@xcite which go to v@xmath12=87 turned out to be overlapped with stronger lines from different progressions .",
    "exciting other upper vibrational levels that would give fluorescence to high lying ground state levels was not applicable due to the presence of strong k@xmath8 fluorescence in the same spectral region .",
    "we searched also for transitions to the  state due to the so called long - range - changeover which provided precious information in the case of narb @xcite and lics @xcite . by exciting a b state level close to the atomic asymptote ( in those cases ( n@xmath13s)+(m@xmath13p ) )",
    "we actually approach the range where hund s case ( c ) starts to be more appropriate than hund s case ( a ) ( due to the large fine structure splitting of the lowest p state in rb and cs ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a decay from such excited levels to both   ( @xmath14 ) and  ( @xmath15 component ) states is possible , which can not be explained within the hund s case ( a ) or ( b ) models either due to selection rules or due to vanishing franck - condon factors for the case of local perturbations .",
    "the case of krb , however , turned out to be more similar to that of nacs @xcite , where the long - range changeover appeared rather fragmentary and provided only few transitions to near asymptotic levels in the  and  states .",
    "our previous experience @xcite has shown , that the states  in the heteronuclear alkali - metal dimers can be modeled within the experimental resolution in the born - oppenheimer approximation by a single potential curve while the hyperfine splitting is well described within our resolution with the atomic hyperfine parameters .",
    "this is possible if the hyperfine structure does not depend on the internuclear separation . only close to the atomic asymptote it is necessary to take into account the mixing with the ground states .    the usual appearance of the hyperfine splitting of the levels is shown in fig",
    "[ hfs ] ( inset of left graph ) .",
    "the splitting into three components is due to the interaction of the electrons with the nuclear spin of the rb atoms .",
    "each of these components is further split due to the interaction with the k nuclear spin .",
    "this interaction is small , contrary to the case of na in narb for example @xcite , and is below our experimental resolution .",
    "in the case of krb we observed for the first time several progressions where the hfs differs from the expected one ( see fig .",
    "[ hfs ] ) .",
    "we made special efforts to study these `` unusual '' features within the possibilities of our experimental setup .",
    "we found out that within a given progression the hyperfine splitting is always independent of the rotational and vibrational quantum numbers of the  ( both for the usual and the unusual cases ) . at the same time transitions to one given  level coming from different excited levels can show different structure .",
    "therefore , we concluded that it should be the structure of the upper state levels which is responsible for the deviations from the expected hfs .",
    "this idea was confirmed by the observation that the unusual hfs changes its appearance when the excitation laser is detuned within the doppler profile of the molecular transition . in fig .",
    "[ hfs2 ] we show results of such an experiment .",
    "the laser excites simultaneously two transitions , one ( ( @xmath16)@xmath17(@xmath18 ) ) gives rise to a progression with usual hfs ( @xmath19 are involved , @xcite ) and the second ( ( @xmath20)@xmath17(@xmath21 ) , the assignment of @xmath22 is not certain , which is unimportant for the analysis of the ground states ) - with unusual one ( @xmath23 are involved ) .",
    "we chose a portion of the fluorescence spectrum where two lines , each belonging to one of the progressions , appear closely together .",
    "then we set the laser frequency within the doppler profile of the transitions at the three position ( center and @xmath24 0.018 and observed the change of the hfs of these lines .",
    "it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ hfs2 ] that while the structure of the line with n@xmath5=9 remains almost unchanged and varies only in intensity , the overall pattern of the line with n@xmath5=11 changes . for the blue and red detuned excitation frequencies , different components of the hyperfine triplet are missing .",
    "moreover , from the relative changes of the intensities of the lines from one laser frequency to another we can expect that the effective widths of the excitation transitions are different .",
    "the transition producing the progression with unusual hfs could be broader , which is probably due to hfs of the upper state level , being comparable with the doppler width of the transition .",
    "this hypothesis seems to be reasonable if we compare it with the hfs of the ( 2)@xmath25 state in narb observed by matsubara _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "so , presently , we understand our observations in the following way : the hfs of the excited complex of singlet and triplet states in krb is in some cases larger than the doppler width of the transitions .",
    "the laser with given frequency excites a selected set of hyperfine components which in turn does not give fluorescence to the full multiplet of the  levels .",
    "the observed structure of the spectral lines reflects the hfs both of the lower and the upper electronic states .    as a center frequency for a given hyperfine multiplet we chose the frequency of the central component of the hfs triplet ( see the left part of fig .",
    "[ hfs ] ) which is normally also the strongest . for the potential fit we used these frequencies and included the term energy of the upper level as a free parameter , common for all frequencies forming one progression .",
    "this selection is possible , because in a given progression the appearance of the hfs turned out to be independent of the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers within the experimental resolution . in case of progression with unusual hfs",
    ", we took a characteristic feature of the hyper fine group of lines ( usually the strongest peak ) . in this way we were able to reproduce correctly the vibrational and rotational spacings of the within a progression",
    "we did not make efforts to reproduce the unusual hfs of the transitions , because our present understanding of the problem indicates that we need to include also the hfs of the upper state , the study of which is outside the scope of this work and would ask for a different experimental setup to get sufficient data for a convincing analysis .      establishing",
    "the rotational numbering of the triplet progressions was straightforward because almost always they were accompanied by the corresponding progression to the ground  state . for finding the proper vibrational numbering",
    "we first decided to rely on the possibility of scaling the molecular constants of one electronic state with the ratio of the reduced masses of different isotopomers .",
    "experimentally , progressions belonging to the molecule with the less abundant isotope @xmath1rb were easy to distinguish by the broader hfs compared to @xmath3rb . in our initial analysis we had several progressions in @xmath2k@xmath3rb and one in @xmath2k@xmath1rb .",
    "the range of n@xmath5 @xcite was from 31 to 68 and v@xmath5 spanning a range of 15 vibrational quanta .",
    "several fits of dunham - type coefficients with different vibrational assignment including both isotopomers indicated the most probable one which we took for further analysis of the experimental data and potential energy curve ( pec ) construction .",
    "once the initial vibrational numbering was suggested , we fitted a potential curve for the  state using a point - wise representation @xcite and used it to assign new vibrational progressions . periodically , as the size of the experimental data set significantly increased , the pec was refined .",
    "we noticed , however , that for larger n@xmath5 there was a growing systematic disagreement between the observed and the calculated transition frequencies , which reached about 0.05  for the highest n@xmath5 . after all experimental data were assigned",
    ", this problem remained . similarly to the  state in narb @xcite , we can exclude the possibility for significant spin - rotational and second order spin - orbit effects in the  state of krb .",
    "therefore , we searched for a connection between these systematic disagreements and the presence of unusual hfs of the transitions to the  state levels - a phenomenon observed only in krb up to now . careful examination of the spectra and collection of new experimental observations proved that such a connection is not indicated by our data set . therefore , we were forced to revise the initially established vibrational numbering , since our experience from the state in narb had shown that a wrong vibrational numbering could lead to similar systematic disagreements for high rotational quantum numbers .",
    "we tried several hypothesis of shifting v@xmath5 by up to 2 vibrational quanta and finally for one of them we got an excellent description of the whole data set within the experimental uncertainty .    here",
    "we want to direct special attention to this problem , because it is common practice to establish vibrational numbering by using the mass relations between the isotopes .",
    "our experience in narb and krb  states demonstrates now , that given a limited set of levels with assinged rotational and vibrational quantum numbers , it is still possible to achieve an almost satisfactory quality of the fit assuming an incorrect vibrational assignment . in both molecules ,",
    "discussed as examples here , we were able to construct pecs that fit the experimental data up to n@xmath5=70 , but turned out to be systematically inadequate when going to higher n@xmath5 .",
    "it is important to note also that in both cases the lowest vibrational levels ( @xmath26 for krb ) were not observed experimentally thus missing in the data field .    finally , the analysis of our experimental data led to the assignment of 2400 transition frequencies to about 1100 rovibrational levels in the  state in krb . in fig .",
    "[ dataset ] the range of the observed triplet state energy levels is presented .",
    "the full list of the transition frequencies is given in table i of the supplementary material .",
    "after the assignment of the levels of the  state and the derivation of a preliminary potential for it , we made first coupled channel calculations including the two states correlated to the 4s+5s atomic asymptote and the hyperfine interaction @xcite .",
    "the purpose was to determine the region where the  and  states could be treated as uncoupled , and to use this region for fitting the pec for the  state .",
    "for the  we took the potential given in ref .",
    "@xcite , extended it by the dispersion coefficients from refs .  @xcite .",
    "these calculations indicated that the mixing between the two states is expected to be strong around @xmath27 and exactly there we found the largest disagreement between the results of the single channel fit and the experimental observation .",
    "this disagreement , however could not be fully explained even after the coupling was taken into account .",
    "therefore , we decided to reinvestigate experimentally the highest levels of the ground state in krb , trying to collect higher vibrational levels with a wider range of j@xmath5 .    due to better signal - to - noise ratio in our experiment",
    "we were able to extend the highest observed vibrational quantum number to v@xmath5=88 .",
    "the corresponding levels were observed for j@xmath28 .",
    "the assignment of the observed transitions was based on the analysis of ref .",
    "as already mentioned in section  [ exper ] the weak krb progressions close to the asymptote were overlapped by stronger k@xmath8 transitions . apparently , this led to an incorrect determination of the transition frequency to the ( v@xmath5=86 , j@xmath5=52 ) level in ref .",
    "@xcite by about 0.02 . in order to increase the confidence in our assignment and avoid similar situations we excited the same upper level from different  levels .",
    "thus , krb lines of interest should be the same , but overlapping krb or k@xmath8 lines should be shifted or disappear . as an example , we show in fig .",
    "[ v88 ] progressions starting from ( v@xmath11 , j@xmath11=51 ) , excited from ( v@xmath5=8 , j@xmath5=50 ) for the upper trace and ( v@xmath5=9 , j@xmath5=52 ) for the lower trace . the same progression is shown also in fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , but there excited from ( v@xmath5=9 , j@xmath5=52 ) . by a simple inspection it is immediately clear what lines appear in both traces and are thus the desired krb lines .",
    "overall , the present experiment brings 1200 additional lines to the data set of the  state .",
    "in order to make a reliable connection in the energy scale between the  and the  states we added to the ground state data set also levels of progressions ( about 600 transitions ) that were recorded simultaneously with progressions to the triplet state and originating both from a common upper state level . in this way",
    "we add in total about 1800 new transition frequencies to the primary data set obtained in ref .",
    "the full description of the experimental data needs a model including adiabatic pecs of the two electronic states and parameters that describe the coupling between them due to the hyperfine interaction .",
    "similarly to the approach adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite we first constructed the potentials using single channel fits and then we performed coupled channels calculations and determined the shifts due to the interaction between the states . as a next step , we corrected the experimental data with the calculated corrections , obtaining in this way `` adiabatic '' data sets , i.e. data sets that would have been observed if the states would not couple .",
    "afterwards the whole procedure was repeated until the results of the coupled channels calculations agreed with the experimental observations .    for the potential construction we first used the pointwise representation .",
    "in the initial stages of fitting it has the advantage to be very flexible , achieving a convergence in only few iterations . in this way",
    "the potential curve was refined following the growth of the experimental data set , several hypothesis of the vibrational numbering in the  state were tested and also some wrong line assignments were identified . for the coupled channels fit the pointwise potentials were transformed into analytic form @xcite with which the number of free parameters is reduced by almost a factor of two .",
    "we split the representation of the potentials into three regions : the repulsive wall ( r@xmath29r@xmath30 ) , the asymptotic region ( r@xmath31r@xmath32 ) , and the intermediate region in between .",
    "the analytic form of each potential in the intermediate range is described by a finite power expansion with a nonlinear variable function @xmath33 of internuclear separation r :    @xmath34    @xmath35    where \\{a@xmath36 } are fitting parameters and @xmath37 and @xmath38 are chosen during the transform process from the spline representation to the analytic one , @xmath38 is close to the value of the equilibrium separation .",
    "the potential is continuously extrapolated for r @xmath39 with :    @xmath40    by adjusting the @xmath41 and @xmath42 parameters .",
    "for large internuclear distances ( r@xmath43 ) we adopted the standard long range form of molecular potentials :    @xmath44    where the exchange contribution is given by    @xmath45    and @xmath46 is the energy of the atomic asymptote ( excluding the hyperfine energies ) with respect to the minimum of the state .",
    "it coincides with the dissociation energy of this state , @xmath47 .",
    "the exchange energy is repulsive for the triplet state ( plus sign in ( [ lrexp ] ) ) and attractive for the singlet state ( minus sign ) .",
    "all parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ lrexp],[exch ] ) are common for the  and the  states .    as a first guess we used the theoretical estimates of long range parameters published by derevianko et al . and porsev et al .",
    "@xcite for the  and the triplet  state .",
    "for the exchange energy amplitude we adopted the estimation from theoretical potentials in ref .",
    "the continuation at @xmath48 was obtained smoothly by variation of @xmath46 or @xmath49 , the latter is preferred because the dissociation asymptote is taken as common energy reference for both states and set to zero here .    for the coupled channels calculations",
    "the hyperfine interaction is taken into account as caused by the fermi contact interaction .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the electronic spin @xmath50 and the nuclear spin @xmath51 defines the interaction parameters :    @xmath52    from the experimental spectra the a@xmath53 and a@xmath54 constants could be determined applying hund s case @xmath55 as basis . generally , the molecular coupling parameters correspond to the atomic constants a. but for atoms forming a diatomic molecule the dependence of these parameters on the bond length and thus on the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers can not be excluded ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within the resolution of our experiment we recorded partially resolved hyperfine structure of the levels of the  state and since our data covered a broad range of such levels we checked the dependence of a@xmath53 , a@xmath56 and a@xmath57 on vibrational and rotational quantum numbers .",
    "as obtained in other cases of mixed alkalis the observed hyperfine splitting is described within experimental accuracy by using the atomic parameters as compiled by arimondo @xcite .",
    "then , each special case of strong coupling between the singlet and the triplet levels is well described by the coupled channels calculations .    with the definitions by equations [ xv ] to [ hfs ]",
    ", the iteration process of potential fitting and calculation of the corrections by singlet - triplet coupling was performed on all spectroscopic observations of the state by @xcite and from the present work and of the state .",
    "it is especially important to note that we obtained a large set of fluorescence progressions of and with a common excited level , which fixes the relative energy positions of singlet and triplet level schemes precisely and gives information on the exchange energy from levels close to the dissociation asymptote . in total , 12502 transition frequencies were contained in the fit and 68 free parameters were varied , which gave a dimensionless standard deviation @xmath58 for both states together .",

    "as it was already mentioned in the introduction , feshbach resonances for @xmath0k@xmath1rb were observed by several groups @xcite . in this section",
    "we apply the derived potentials to calculate these feshbach resonances and compare them with observations .",

    "we use for the comparison the s - wave resonances observed by ref .",
    "@xcite , because these data represent the largest set and come from the same lab , thus they should not show possible internal inconsistency like calibration errors of the magnetic field .",
    "all calculated resonances were found within 50 gauss from the observed ones , this deviation is not surprisingly large because these calculations are extrapolations out of the range of spectroscopic observations ; the largest outer turning point of observed levels is at 12.6   for the singlet state and at 14.8   for the triplet state being 6.4 @xmath62and 2.3 @xmath62below the dissociation asymptote , respectively .",
    "this indicates , that the spectroscopic observation ends within the changeover to the long range behavior and the quality of the extrapolation follows more from the reliability of the theoretical estimates of the dispersion coefficients @xcite than from our experimental data .",
    "thus the measured feshbach resonances contain information on the long range function . to include them in the total potential determination we set up a non - linear",
    "least squares fitting code for the dispersion parameters , which contains the scattering calculations as subroutine and searches for the maximum of the elastic rate coefficient which corresponds to the observed feshbach resonance .",
    "the resonances have been observed by trap loss of potassium , thus by an inelastic process , which will need three body collisions .",
    "as very often assumed , the three body cross section should be enhanced by the condition of a two body feshbach resonance .",
    "the calculations were done for a temperature of @xmath130 and use the accuracy of the magnetic field of 0.2 g , as stated in ref .",

    "we checked if these are also well described with the present potentials . especially in @xcite the splitting between @xmath139 and @xmath140 of a p wave is reported and it gives the opportunity to check if the spin - spin or second order spin - orbit coupling for the triplet state needs to be adjusted which both together can be described by the effective operator @xcite :    @xmath141    @xmath142 is a function of internuclear separation r and typically is derived from spectroscopic data as an expectation value of a specific vibrational level .",
    "here we use simple functional forms to incorporate the pure dipole - dipole contribution for the spin - spin interaction as a function @xmath143 and the spin - orbit part as an exponential function reflecting effectively an overlap integral of the electronic distribution of the two atoms :    @xmath144    all quantities are given in atomic units , @xmath145 is the fine structure constant and @xmath146 , b , and r@xmath147 are the model parameters for the second order spin - orbit contribution . since the data in hand can not be sensitive to the actual function , we selected values for b and @xmath148 , which are comparable to the example of rb@xmath8 @xcite ( b= 0.7196 a@xmath149 and r@xmath147= 7.5 a@xmath150 ) and fitted the parameter @xmath151 which gives @xmath146= -0.013 a@xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) .",

    "[ lambda ] dominates in the internuclear separation interval @xmath154 important for the bound levels of the triplet state which determine the feshbach resonances .    taking this result into account ,",
    "the four resonances reported in @xcite involving _ l _ = 1 and 2 were calculated .",
    "= 1 resonances were found within the experimental accuracy , and it is predicted that the resonance at 456 g is split for m@xmath155=0 , @xmath24 1 by about 0.1 g where the component m@xmath155=0 is higher in field than the others . this is opposite to the case of the observed resonance at 515 g. the _ l _ = 2 resonances were found above the observed magnetic field but not more than 0.7 g , the reason for this difference is presently unclear .",
    "these resonances are very sharp , the calculated rate constants of the corresponding elastic collisions have half widths of less than 0.001 g , which depends on the magnitude of the above mentioned ss coupling . no value was given in @xcite for their calculations of the widths .",
    "an extensive dataset on the  state of krb was collected covering energy levels in a wide range of vibrational and rotational quantum numbers in @xmath2k@xmath3rb and @xmath2k@xmath1rb .",
    "the classical turning point of the last observed level ( @xmath156 , @xmath157 ) lies at 14.6   on the fitted rotationless potential energy curve .",
    "the long range parameters c@xmath158 , c@xmath159 , and c@xmath160 deviate only slightly from the theoretical estimates by ref .",
    "@xcite , but we should remind the reader , that the present data set does not allow to determine independently all three parameters . thus due to correlations between those of the data analysis",
    ", there is no contradiction to those of the theory .",
    "but for modeling of cold collisions one should use the values reported in tables  [ tabx ] and [ taba ] of the present work .",
    "the complete determination of the potential curves allows for reliable extrapolation to the dissociation limit and thus their depths .",
    "tables  [ tabx ] and [ taba ] give 4217.815(10 ) @xmath62  and 249.031(10 ) @xmath62   for the respective dissociation energies .",
    "recently , wang et al .",
    "@xcite reported about an independent determination of the dissociation energy of the singlet state using a photoassociation - depletion process to obtain binding energies of loosely bound vibration levels , namely @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the dissociation energy was derived by adding level energies with respect to the minimum of the potential curve as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite by a near - dissociation expansion ( nde ) approach . the final value 4217.822(3 ) @xmath62  agrees with ours within the given error limits .",
    "but for estimating the error limit wang et al .",
    "assume that the accuracy of level energy @xmath161 is equal to the standard deviation of the nde fit , 0.0015 @xmath62 .",
    "looking into the actual data set from ref .",
    "@xcite one finds that for @xmath161 only two high rotational states with @xmath163 = 50 and 52 were observed .",
    "thus a fairly far extrapolation to the levels with @xmath164 is done , and one should certainly include the correlation of the nde parameters for the error estimation . additionally , we would remind the reader , that we corrected a misidentification of v=86 levels , due to overlapping lines , and this would effect the nde analysis .",
    "therefore , the good agreement between our present dissociation energy and that reported by wang et al . could be fortunate . as a second check we calculated the binding energies for @xmath161 and 89 from our results and found them larger by 0.026 @xmath62  and 0.053 @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath161 the deviation is about 12 times the error limit reported by wang et al .",
    "we tried to incorporate the measured binding energies in a new fit of the potentials including our spectroscopic results and the feshbach resonances from ref .",
    "@xcite , but no convincing result was obtained up to now .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is unclear for us , especially because we extended the dataset from ref .",
    "@xcite just around @xmath161 with more @xmath163 levels and by measurements with @xmath165 .",
    "thus the energy interval where the @xmath161 is located is well covered by our measurements which have an accuracy of typically 0.003 @xmath62 .    by new spectroscopic data",
    "the potential curve of could be refined compared to the work by ref .",
    "@xcite , and we were able to link it to the potential curve of with respect to the asymptotic function and to the relative energy position of both functions .",
    "this was the prerequisite to start the inclusion of the observed feshbach resonances @xcite into the modeling , which finally leads to a complete system for predicting ultracold collision properties .",
    "such prediction can be extended to other isotopomers , as presented partly in table [ scatlength ] .",
    "but it would be clearly desirable to get precise feshbach resonances also for different isotopomers in order to check the degree of validity of the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "despite the combination of the spectroscopic and feshbach data there is a significant gap in the energy interval below the atomic asymptote ( about 3 ) in which bound levels of low rotational quantum numbers , preferable j or n = 0 , could be observed .",
    "thus the prediction in this region relies on the quality of the long range parameters and measurements e.g. by two - color photo association would be valuable . to reach such levels by feshbach spectroscopy",
    "is not promising because too high magnetic fields would be needed .",
    "krb is very often discussed for applications in studies of dipolar cold gases or even quantum computing . to transfer feshbach molecules to deeply bound levels which are stable and would have large electric dipole moments , spectroscopic data on excited states",
    "will be of importance to predict efficient processes .",
