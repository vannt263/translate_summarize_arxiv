    "therefore accurate modeling needs to cover lengths from atomistic to mesoscopic scales . the problem is usually tackled either by the tight - binding methodology @xcite or by means of the effective mass theory @xcite .",
    "the first one is more rigorous in treating atomistic details of wave functions , while the effective mass theory requires less computational time and has better scaling with the size of the system .",
    "however , since its application to donors in early days , the effective mass theory has been faced with including the effect of the valley - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "the valley - orbit coupling , induced by a fast varying part of the confinement potential , lifts the six - fold degeneracy of the conduction band minima in the presence of a fast - varying confinement potential and leads to a specific valley composition for each bound state .",

    "an accurate interpretation of stm images of dopants usually starts with computing their single - electron wave functions which are employed in further analysis based on the quasi - particle picture @xcite .",

    "<S> using the effective mass theory and the multi - valley envelope function representation , we have developed a theoretical framework for computing the single - electron electronic structure of several phosphorus donors interacting in an arbitrary geometrical configuration in silicon taking into account the valley - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology is applied to three coupled phosphorus donors , arranged in a linear chain and in a triangle , and to six donors arranged in a regular hexagon . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the simulations evidence that the valley composition of the single - electron states strongly depends on the geometry of the dopant molecule and its orientation relative to the crystallographic axes of silicon . </S>",
    "<S> the electron binding energy of the triatomic linear molecules is larger than that of the diatomic molecule oriented along the same crystallographic axis , but the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state is not significantly different for internuclear distances from 1.5 to 6.6 nm . </S>",
    "<S> three donor atoms arranged in a triangle geometry have larger binding energies than a triatomic linear chain of dopants with the same internuclear distances . </S>",
    "<S> the planar donor molecules are characterized by a strong polarization in favor of the valleys oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization increases with number of atoms forming the planar molecule . </S>"
