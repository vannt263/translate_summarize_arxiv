    "in case of conductivity over delocalized states ( diffusive conductivity ) the electric field dependence of the conductivity originates from heating of 2dhg up to temperature @xmath10 , greater than lattice temperature @xmath8 . in the stationary conditions @xmath10",
    "is determined by the balance between incoming energy rate @xmath11 and energy relaxation rate @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , studying the nonohmic conductivity , one can find the energy relaxation rate @xmath12 , its dependence on @xmath8 , @xmath10 and determine the main mechanisms of the energy relaxation .",
    "moreover , the study of the nonohmic conductivity provides an opportunity to find the conditions in which the diffusion conductivity changes to hopping conductivity with the change of density , disorder and temperature .",
    "it is possible due to the fact that in the hopping regime of conductivity @xmath13 dependence results not only from the change of the carrier distribution over energy , but also from the change in probability of hopes along the field .    over the past 20 years",
    "there have been published a number of experimental papers , investigating heating of 2d electron gas in gaas structures at high conductivities @xcite , and a few papers studying p - type @xcite , but only for lattice temperatures below 100mk . to the best of our knowledge , there is no experiment within a wide conductivity range at higher temperatures in the present paper , we investigate the dependence of the energy relaxation rate on the carrier density and the strength of disorder in ingaas based 2d hole structures in the temperature range of 1.4 - 4.2k and a wide range of conductivities @xmath2 .",
    "we have obtained the following results .",
    "it was shown , that at conductivities above @xmath14 the energy relaxation rate is well described in terms of scattering on acoustic phonons @xcite . at lower conductivities @xmath15",
    "the energy relaxation rate deviates down from the theory in ref .  , while the regime of conductivity remains diffusive .",
    "this deviation is associated with the pippard ineffectiveness of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "it was shown that a crossover to the hopping conductivity with lowering of @xmath16 occurs at @xmath17 .",
    "the structures investigated were grown by metalorganic vapor - phase epitaxy on a semi - insulating gaas substrate and consist of a 0.2mkm thick undoped gaas buffer layer , a 10 nm ingaas quantum well and a 0.2 - 0.3mkm cup layer of undoped gaas .",
    "the carbone @xmath18-layer was situated at the distance of 7 nm ( samples 3855 , 3857 ) or 15 nm ( 3953 ) from each side of the quantum well .",
    "the samples were mesa - etched into the standard hall bars .",
    "the hole density was varied by applying voltage to the al gate electrode , deposited by thermal evaporation .",
    "nonohmic conductivity measurements on gated structures require special care : the voltage drop along the sample must be significantly lower than the gate voltage , otherwise the distribution of the carrier under the gate electrode would be non - homogeneous . to avoid this effect",
    "the sample surface was covered by a 3 - 5mkm thick dielectric ( parylen ) layer before depositing the gate electrode . with this layer",
    "@xmath19 was less than @xmath20 and we could apply gate voltage @xmath21 up to 300v ( while the voltage drop along the sample was less than 0.5v ) .",
    "the hole densities and conductivities at zero gate voltage and lattice temperature @xmath22 for the structures investigated are listed in table 1 .",
    ".the parameters of the samples . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    the hole effective mass @xmath23 was obtained from temperature dependence of shubnikov - de haas oscillations @xcite .",
    "the dependence @xmath24 was obtained in a set of measurements with a long gate electrode , covering two pairs of hall contacts ( upper inset in fig .",
    "the heating experiments were taken with a shorter ( hall contacts remained uncovered ) gate electrode ( lower inset in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) to avoid the rise in contact resistance at a high bias voltage .",
    "the current dependence of voltage drop between potential contacts 3 - 4 was measured during the current sweep while the lattice temperature remained constant .",

    "the temperature dependence of conductivity of degenerate gas ( @xmath27 , @xmath28- fermi level ) at low temperatures is fully determined by temperature dependence of quantum corrections to the conductivity .",
    "the corrections depend on nothing but the carrier temperature @xmath10 ( the dependence @xmath29 for similar structures was investigated in ref .  ) . in this case , having compared the temperature dependence of conductivity in ohmic regime and electric field dependence of conductivity , we have reconstructed ( follow the dashed line in fig . [ f1 ] ) the electric field dependence of hole temperature @xmath10 , and , then , we have calculated the incoming power @xmath30 , required to heat the holes up to @xmath10@xcite . in stationary conditions",
    "@xmath31 is equal to energy relaxation rate @xmath5 .",

    "similar results were obtained for all the structures investigated over a wide conductivity range .",
    "let us compare our experimental data with the theory .",
    "as the mechanism governing a relaxation rate at low temperatures is scattering on acoustic phonons with both piezoelectric and deformational coupling , for the quantitative analysis we use the theory from ref .  .",
    "the energy relaxation rate as a function of hole temperature @xmath10 and lattice temperature @xmath8 is written as a difference of two identical functions , where one term depends on @xmath10 , and the other on @xmath8 ( eq.(12 ) in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath32    with    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the form factor for the normal - direction wave function @xmath35 ; 2d is the width of quantum well ; @xmath36 is a screening factor ; @xmath37 isthe phonon distribution function ; @xmath38 is a quantity , associated with the three - dimensional scattering matrix . in general @xmath39 is the sum of deformation - coupled and piezoelectric - coupled contributions :    @xmath40    where index ln refers to the longitudinal component of the wave - vector , and tr to the transversal one",
    ". then each component of @xmath38 could be expressed as follows@xcite :    @xmath41    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is a piezoelectric coupling constant , @xmath45 - deformation potential , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the components of the wave - vector , respectively normal to and parallel to the heterolayer plane .",
    "the constant @xmath48 is equal to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 - is an elastic constant equal to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the density of gaas , @xmath53 is the longitudinal velocity of sound ) .",
    "we have calculated temperature dependences of the energy relaxation rate using the following coupling constants : @xmath54 ( ref .  ) , @xmath55 ( ref .  ) and the two - dimensional screening constant @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is an effective bohr radius .",
    "the calculated curves @xmath5 are presented in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . the dashed and dotted lines are the contributions of the deformation and piezoelectric coupling respectively .",
    "one can see that their contributions are comparable within the whole temperature range .",

    "[ f2 ] the theoretical curves are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "it is impossible to compare directly our experimentally obtained values of the energy relaxation rate with the results in refs .",
    ", , as they have been obtained at lower temperatures ( below 100mk ) . however , if we calculate @xmath5 with the coupling constants , we used , we would get the energy relaxation rate only twice bigger than the experimental value in refs .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) it follows that besides coupling constants , temperatures @xmath10 and @xmath8 , the only sample parameter which the energy relaxation rate depends on is hole density .",
    "let us analyze the dependence of the power @xmath58 required to heat holes from lattice temperature @xmath22 up to @xmath59 , shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that at densities above a certain value ( different for each sample ) , the experimental data is in agreement with the theory . at lower densities",
    "the experimental energy relaxation rate significantly deviates downward from the theoretical value significantly .",
    "such divergence for all the cases takes place when the conductivity of 2d gas falls below @xmath14 ( fig .",
    ".    a possible reason for such divergence could be the change of a conductivity mechanism ( it is commonly believed that at @xmath60 conductivity is hopping ) , and in this case the described above treatment with @xmath12 is not valid any more . to clarify the conductivity mechanism",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) it is seen that in a diffusive regime the derivative @xmath63 is independent of lattice temperature @xmath8 .",
    "it means that experimental dependences @xmath64 , obtained at different @xmath65 should fall on the universal curve@xcite .",
    "this statement is valid when the change of @xmath16 with the electric field originates from the change of the hole temperature only . as the consequence , the set of curves @xmath66 as a function of @xmath16 also has such a property . besides , the treatment with @xmath66 is more consequent because when the approximation of the hole temperature fails , @xmath66 remains defined .    in the hopping regime , firstly",
    ", @xmath16 depends both on lattice and hole temperatures .",
    "secondly , the change of conductivity with the electric field results not only from hole heating , but also from the change in probability of hopes .",
    "finally , the energy distribution function of holes in the electric field can deviate from the fermi - dirac function .",
    "all these effects have to lead to a divergence of dependences @xmath67 at different @xmath8 .",
    "dependencies @xmath66 for sample 3855 , obtained experimentally , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . as seen from fig .",
    "[ f3](a ) the data taken at different lattice temperatures fall on one universal dependence when the conductivity of the 2d gas is relatively high @xmath68 . with decreasing of conductivity",

    "[ f3 ] ( b , c ) ) . and",
    "only at @xmath70 the curves begin to diverge , and with a decrease in conductivity they diverge drastically ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ( d , e , f ) ) .",
    "such divergence indicates a crossover to a hopping regime of conductivity in the investigated structures .     at different lattice temperatures for sample 3855 .",
    "the values of conductivities at @xmath22 are presented at figures . ]    hence , the conductivity remains diffusive at @xmath71 and the drop in the energy relaxation rate at conductivity range @xmath72 is caused not by a crossover to the hopping conductivity .",
    "we believe that the it is caused by the pippard ineffectiveness of the electron - phonon interactions@xcite , which takes place under the following conditions : i ) the number of carriers within the length of the thermal phonon is sufficient to introduce the local conductivity @xmath73 ( @xmath74 is the wave vector of the thermal phonon ) , and ii ) @xmath75 , ( @xmath76 means free path ) .",
