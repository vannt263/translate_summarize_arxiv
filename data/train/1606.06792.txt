    "an active field of research in quantum optics and quantum information is the development of techniques for producing arbitrary quantum states of different physical systems .",
    "this is by virtue of the broad range of applications including quantum computation and communication  @xcite , quantum simulation  @xcite , and quantum metrology  @xcite , that each need different specific quantum states as a resource .",
    "light is a key quantum system which can be interfaced with a variety of other individual quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "there are particular states , e.g. , w - states  @xcite , ghz - states  @xcite , and cluster states  @xcite , which are of great importance for many protocols , and it is anticipated that the exploration of other multimode states will also be promising .",
    "thus , having a single easily reconfigurable device which prepares arbitrary multimode quantum states would provide considerable versatility for numerous applications  @xcite . towards this goal , a number of theoretical and experimental studies have been performed concerning the preparation of arbitrary single - mode  @xcite as well as arbitrary multimode quantum states  @xcite .",
    "it is usually the case that universal schemes possess a high degree of complexity due to their extremely large number of degrees of freedom , even for a small number of modes , which makes them impractical without some restrictions .",
    "a feasible approach to this problem can be taken if we restrict the dimensionality of each output mode to two .",
    "in other words , we restrict ourselves to _ arbitrary multi - qubit state generation_. regarding the cost of the scheme , we will be utilising passive linear transformations ; avoiding any active elements , which in turn means to only use beam splitters and phase shifters , and we allow measurements on some ancillary systems to introduce the required nonlinearity .",
    "we would also like to encode quantum bits in the absence or presence of photons , the so - called single - rail encoding  @xcite . as well as requiring fewer resources , such states are efficient under temporal multiplexing  @xcite and suitable for interactions with matter quantum systems .",
    "the key goal is thus a device which produces arbitrary single - rail multi - qubit resource states for a variety of quantum tasks .",
    "importantly , we want to prepare the target state by heralding via measurements of the ancillae and without postselection .",
    "to the best of authors knowledge , our scheme is the first of this kind which provides all of the properties mentioned above .    in the present contribution",
    ", we introduce and analyse a universal scheme for generation of arbitrary multi - qubit quantum states in a single - rail encoding using passive linear optics and heralding measurements .",
    "our scheme makes use of @xmath0 single - photon input states .",
    "we extract part of their amplitude using beam splitters and inject it into a unitary network of size @xmath1 .",
    "the other ports of the unitary will receive @xmath2 ancillary single - photon inputs and @xmath3 ancillary vacuum inputs , while there will be @xmath4 projections onto single - qubits and @xmath5 vacuum measurements at the output .",
    "we show our scheme is universal and give particular examples of two- and three - qubit cluster states as target states , a class of states known to be very hard to prepare in single - rail encoding .",
    "we show that our scheme delivers a high probability of success , for low numbers of photons , even compared to non - universal schemes where there exists a fairly comparable strategy .",
    "we also analyse the effects of loss and imperfections .",
    "our scheme is experimentally feasible for a small number of photons using current technology .",
    "moreover , we study the general case of @xmath0-qubit generation and give interesting connections to the boson sampling problem  @xcite .",
    "the method presented here is equally applicable to other bosonic systems , e.g. spin ensembles  @xcite and optomechanics  @xcite by making use of light - matter beam splitter interactions and photonic ancillae .",
    "in this section we design a linear - optics scheme to generate arbitrary two - qubit target states , @xmath6 with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) being complex numbers .",
    "such a state can be for example shared between two distant parties , alice and bob .    a major problem in any such a device",
    "then would be the suppression of the two - photon terms @xmath9 and @xmath10 due to hong - ou - mandel effect .",
    "it has been shown that without relying on measurements one can not avoid these bunching effects  @xcite .",
    "a simple way to circumvent this issue is by preventing the photons from exchanging between two principal modes from input to output , rather than using fock basis truncations  @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ twoqbsch ] .",
    "we will show that this technique despite its simplicity is very effective .",
    "accordingly , we split the circuit into two stages : ( i ) an entangling projector  this could be carried out by a third party , say charlie , as a central station who sends signals to alice and bob on the successful events , and ( ii ) a quantum _ pick - off _ ; this could be done locally with the help of alice and bob ( c.f .",
    "[ twoqbsch ] ) . in the following",
    "we give a detailed description of both stages .",
    "firstly , let us discuss what we mean by entangling measurement in our scheme .",
    "we note that to be able to produce the state in  , there is a need for independent control of four coefficients @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . for the moment , we do not take into account the reduction of degrees of freedom by normalization constraint , because it should be possible to equate any of the coefficients with zero .",
    "this demands charlie to realize projectors of the form @xmath11 such that the first four complex coefficients , @xmath12 ( @xmath8 ) , are arbitrarily controllable .",
    "notice that the need for two - photon components arises from the use of linear optics as previously commented .",
    "as we will show , a @xmath13 unitary operation with an ancillary vacuum measurement and two arbitrary single - qubit projectors is the smallest unitary circuit having the capability to produce @xmath14 . using a retrodictive approach",
    ", we now calculate the projector in fig .",
    "[ twoqbsch ] just before the unitary .",
    "this is given by @xmath15 in which @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath18 .",
    "using the definition @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , we now switch to the heisenberg picture via the isomorphic matrix representation , @xmath21 in which @xmath22 we call the submatrix @xmath23 the _ active _ submatrix .",
    "rearranging the resulting components in   and projecting onto the ancillary vacuum input , @xmath24 , gives @xmath25 in which @xmath26 here , that is the case when a single photon is input into port two and no photons into port one : ( i ) either a photon is detected at the output mode two with probability amplitude of @xmath27 coming from mode two with a transition probability amplitude of @xmath28 , ( ii ) or a photon is detected at the output mode one with probability amplitude of @xmath29 coming from mode two with a transition probability amplitude of @xmath30 .",
    "also @xmath31 represent the probability amplitudes of getting no photons in the other port .",
    "] , @xmath32 represents the _ permanent _ of the active submatrix , which are obtained from elements on the intersection of rows @xmath33 and columns @xmath34 .",
    "note that , permanents have cyclic symmetry , that is @xmath35 for any permutation @xmath36 of the index set , and @xmath37 trivially .      at the second stage ,",
    "we need to chop off the extra dimensions of our entangling measurement . for this , alice and bob split their single - photons using two variable beamsplitters , characterized by transmissivity - reflectivity ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( c.f .",
    "fig  [ twoqbsch ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath40 upon beamsplitter transformation @xmath41 .",
    "now , charlie applies his entangling projector on two branches he receives from alice and bob , and thus the un - normalized output is @xmath42 in which @xmath43 and @xmath12 ( @xmath8 ) are given by eqs .   and  .",
    "for future reference , we have used the superscript @xmath44 to indicate that the input was @xmath45 .",
    "the probability of success for getting the desired target state is then given by the trace of output state , @xmath46 . by comparing eq .",
    "with eq .  , we can write down a set of nonlinear equations to be solved for all parameters , such that the probability of success is optimized : @xmath47 there are also constraints to be satisfied by the @xmath48 entries : ( i ) each row must be normalized , and ( ii ) each row must be orthogonal to all other rows .",
    "let us show that a @xmath48 matrix is the smallest unitary matrix for which the set   possesses a solution under the aforementioned constraints .",
    "first , we note that @xmath49 is uniquely determined by @xmath50 through @xmath51 and @xmath52 , independent of the unitary .",
    "therefore , we need to control three amplitudes and only three phases using the unitary .",
    "second , notice that the matrix @xmath48 in eq .",
    "has six free parameters , three amplitudes and three phases .",
    "also , one should note that one of the phases is global which could determine the relative phase between @xmath53 and the other components .",
    "however , this can be also absorbed into the phase of @xmath31 . as a result ,",
    "only two phases are sufficient . nevertheless , due to the fact that three free amplitudes are required , the smallest matrix would be that of a @xmath48 . in appendix  [ appa",
    "] , we have shown that the set of equations   indeed possesses a solution when there are three complex variables available . in the next sections",
    "we will first describe how it is possible to perform single - qubit projections , and then we demonstrate our solution strategy to these equations through an example .      in the scheme already discussed , two arbitrary single - qubit projectors at the output of the unitary network play crucial roles .",
    "for instance , their coefficient directly determine the coefficient of @xmath53 component ; see e.g. eqs .   and  .",
    "here we describe how these measurements can be realized and discuss the associated heralding probabilities .",
    "first , let us propose a simple way of implementing our arbitrary single - qubit projector . in this proposal ,",
    "a coherent state @xmath54 hits a beamsplitter of trasmissivity - reflectivity @xmath55 ; see fig .",
    "[ sqprojcoh ] .        for simplicity , we are assuming both trasmissivity and reflectivity take on real values .",
    "the output is then measured by two single - photon counters .",
    "the beamsplitter transformation is assumed to be @xmath56 with @xmath57 , thus , the resulting projector can be calculated as @xmath58 choosing @xmath59 can generate any single - qubit measurement with probability of @xmath60 , while the phases can be implemented via some phase shifts on beamsplitter .    the @xmath60 overhead from this scheme is entirely due to the exponential prefactor which originates from the use of a coherent state input .",
    "this overhead could be eliminated if the state were confined to the lowest two fock basis states .",
    "therefore , inspired by the work of ralph _ et al _",
    "@xcite which proposes the use of real - time adaptive detection of phase from  @xcite to _ deterministically _ prepare superposition states of zero and one photon , we propose the following . assuming that one can deterministically prepare arbitrary single - qubit states via adaptive phase measurement , the coherent state @xmath54 is replaced by a single - qubit state @xmath61 and",
    "the beamsplitter is being fixed to be balanced . at the output ,",
    "there are three possible events containing different combinations of zero and one clicks : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( the failure event ) . considering the @xmath62 event , using a retrodictive approach , we find @xmath65 this is half of the desired event , in the sense that if we inject the correct state @xmath66 into the device , only half of the times it will pop - up the occurrence of the event .",
    "there are , however , two other possible events : @xmath64 , the total failure event , and @xmath63 .",
    "the latter is of particular interest as we will see shortly .",
    "if we get the event @xmath63 instead of @xmath62 , we have @xmath67 in the following , we show that one could correct the output state simply by feed - forwarding two extra classical bits to the principal output modes .",
    "notably , in general , the two positive operator - valued - measure ( povm ) elements @xmath68 and @xmath69 are not orthogonal . the failure event is also given as @xmath70 .",
    "note that the event space of the clicks for our two - qubit scheme is nine fold : @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , and only one of them is the desired click , namely @xmath73 , corresponding to two @xmath63 events of the form   and resulting the projection @xmath74 of eq .  .",
    "importantly , the factor of @xmath75 causes the overall probability of success to reduce by a factor of @xmath76 with respect to the ideal case .    now",
    ", suppose that we get the _ invert _ event @xmath77 .",
    "in view of eq .  , this will result in two phase shifts of @xmath78 in @xmath79 and thus , according to eqs .",
    ",  , and  , nothing is changed except the two coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 which pick up an extra phase of @xmath78 . evidently , the invert output occurs with exactly the same probability of success as the desired one .",
    "moreover , we may correct the invert output by feed - forwarding the outcome to apply two local phase shifts to the principal modes ; c.f .",
    "such phase shifts will change the sign of the coefficients of @xmath82 and @xmath83 terms leaving the @xmath53 component intact .",
    "we may ask how much does the correction improve the overall probability of success ? to answer , we note the probability of success of invert event to be the same as desired event .",
    "this implies that taking into account the possibility of feed - forward correction doubles the overall probability of success , and decreases its reduction due to nondeterministic measurements to a factor of @xmath84 with respect to the ideal case .",
    "let us consider the example of preparing the state , @xmath85 which gives the usual two - qubit cluster state when @xmath86 .",
    "we consider the output state   and without loss of generality assume @xmath87 can be absorbed into the unitary elements , as they can be represented by some phase shifters in front of the unitary circuit . ] with @xmath88 and that @xmath89 .",
    "we also take @xmath90 and @xmath91 to be real .",
    "similar to eq .",
    ", these lead to the following set of nonlinear equations @xmath92 in which @xmath93 , and it is constrained to @xmath94 the success probability for this state is given by the norm of the output state , @xmath95 this set of equations is a regular chain the solution of which can be obtained by solving the first equation for one variable , substituting the result into the second one , and then continuing until all the variables are expressed in terms of five variables , say @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the step - by - step algorithm for numerical optimization is given in appendix  [ appc ] .",
    "the last step is to run an optimization for the probability of success   over parameter ranges .",
    "we have depicted the probability of success of the scheme for a range of relative phase @xmath98 in fig .",
    "[ twoqbclustphi ] .",
    "in particular , the success probability at @xmath86 is @xmath99 .",
    "once we have found the optimal solution for a particular phase @xmath100 , we can use the well - known decomposition by reck _",
    "_  @xcite to evaluate the parameters of the linear optical network realizing @xmath13 . for the special case of @xmath101 and @xmath86 ,",
    "the resulting unitary matrix has been given in appendix  [ appd ] .",
    "we can compare the method used here against other schemes for achieving this particular output state .",
    "knill  @xcite was motivated to find optimised probabilities for controlled - z rotations between optical qubits using linear interactions and post - selection in the fock basis .",
    "knill s constructions were single - rail as for the case of the controlled - z rotations the single - rail operations are directly embedded in the dual - rail operations .",
    "the result of knill also did not have the multi - party preparation model that is used in this paper and hence considered arbitrary linear ineractions between all modes .",
    "knill found that when @xmath86 and with two ancillary modes containing single photons the highest probability of success was @xmath102 .",
    "later extensive numerical searches confirmed this maximal probability over a wider range of networks with more ancillary modes  @xcite .",
    "the ability to exceed this value for the device presented here can be attributed to the lack of need to construct a gate which operates over an entire hilbert space .",
    "the protocol here is merely the generating of the state and hence leaves open the possibility for probabilities exceeding that from implementations which utilise gates .",
    ", of the generalized two - qubit cluster state given in eq .   for @xmath101 . , width=302 ]      it is of interest to ask `` how the scheme of fig",
    "[ twoqbsch ] may transform a given two - qubit input state ? '' in the first place , our scheme is _ passive _ in the sense that there is no possibility for photon addition to any of the modes .",
    "secondly , one can not switch photons between the two modes ( bit flip ) and this is exactly how we prevented the photon bunching effect in the output modes , i.e. , the @xmath9 and @xmath10 components .",
    "it is straight forward to calculate the output state similar to that of eq .",
    "starting with an arbitrary two - qubit state state @xmath103 .",
    "it turns out that the coefficients of the output are just linear combinations of @xmath104 s of eqs .  ,   and  .",
    "a regular chain remains as a regular chain under linear combination of equations , and thus the resultant set always possesses a solution .",
    "this means that our scheme is also a universal quantum state modifier for a known two - qubit inputs in a passive way . of course",
    ", starting with an input state within a subspace of @xmath105 with only one or no photons means an overhead in the free parameters of the scheme .",
    "however , such redundancy will be automatically resolved via optimization of success probability .",
    "inefficiencies and losses are present in any experiment . here , we analyse such deleterious effects , which are four fold : ( i ) imperfect single photon sources , ( ii ) the transmission losses through channels , ( iii ) losses through the unitary circuit , and ( iv ) inefficient measurements . these imperfections directly affect the fidelity of the output state . therefore , to simplify the analysis , we make the following assumptions :    a.   all the measurement devices are the same , and thus they have equal losses , b.   we model all the losses within the unitary network via symmetric losses on all input modes . c.   all the photon sources are the same having equal purities , and , d.   the losses within the principal output modes are equal to that of entangling measurement circuit .    it is known that when the losses within all output ports of a linear network are equal , one can commute the loss with the network . in this way , using the assumptions above , we may express all the imperfections just in terms of imperfect photon sources , and considering all the other elements to be ideal . to justify the last assumption",
    ", we may think of a lossy measurement process on the output state such that it exactly equates the loss of entangling measurement circuit .",
    "we can therefore model all the losses using impure input states , i.e. , @xmath106 in which @xmath107 is assumed to be the overall efficiency of the scheme .",
    "now , the un - normalized output , @xmath108 , is clearly a mixture of four input combinations , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "we have already calculated the output resulting from the last input , @xmath113 .",
    "the other three will give @xmath114 in which @xmath115 is the probability of success for getting the desired target state when the input states are pure single photons . using the expressions in eq .",
    "it is straight forward to evaluate the success probability as @xmath116,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath117 this result demonstrates the fact that , having imperfections , the heralding probability strongly depends on the target state as well as losses . in a similar way , one can calculate the fidelity of the output state as @xmath118 in which @xmath119 expanding the fidelity around one , we find the rate at which it decays as @xmath120 or , equivalently , for nearly perfect efficiency ( @xmath121 ) @xmath122 for the example of a cluster state @xmath123 and thus , this rate is given by @xmath124",
    "a similar strategy as the previous section can be taken to generate arbitrary three - qubit states .",
    "we take three single - photon input states , split them and make an entangling measurement .",
    "the scheme thus would consist of a @xmath125 matrix instead of @xmath48 as described in appendix  [ appb ] , injection of three single photons and three ancillary vacua into the circuit , three arbitrary single - qubit and three vacuum measurements ( c.f .",
    "[ threeqbsch ] ) .     to perform the entangling measurement .",
    ", width=302 ]    after repeating the process , we find the projector @xmath126 in which @xmath127    as an example , we have determined the optimal probability of success for generation of a generalized greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state , @xmath128 to be @xmath129 . clearly , the probability of preparing such a state is independent of the phase value @xmath100 , since it can be obtained by a local @xmath100-phase shift of one of the bits at the output .    in parallel with discussions of sec .",
    "[ sqproj ] , we may represent events as @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "for this scheme as well , all the arguments of sec .",
    "[ sqproj ] hold such that we may improve the heralding probability by a factor of 2 , if we take into account not only the event @xmath132 , but also the invert event @xmath133 . from eqs .   and",
    ", it is evident that we may correct the output just by feed - forwarding three extra classical bits and operating locally on the principal output modes by phase shifters of angle @xmath78 .",
    "a second important thing to note is that , as we can see , all the permanents of the active submatrix of @xmath125 appear in the expressions for the coefficients of the projector . in the next section , we will show that this is generally true for arbitrary large number of qubits .",
    "we also discuss the implication of this pattern about the scalability of our scheme , and we will see that this puts strong limitations on any measurement based scheme .    the non - deterministic remote state preparation of a single - rail ghz state using linear optics and post - selection does not appear to have been proposed before . though the generation probability here is low , to the best of authors knowledge ,",
    "there is no other schemes with which to fairly compare it to .",
    "as we promised , in this section we show that our method can be generalized to prepare arbitrary @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "thus , from an architectural point of view , everything seem to be fine for having such a machine . in appedix  [ appb ] , we have discussed the size of the unitary matrix and the active submatrix to be considered . in general , @xmath134 scales as @xmath135 , the same as the size of the active submatrix .",
    "let us point out that the active submatrix need not be square in general . in fact , one can choose the size depending on the required number of free parameters by choosing any ancillary input port to be injected by a vacuum or a single photon state and any output port to be measured in a vacuum or a single - qubit basis . as a rule of thumb , the input - port number and the output - port number label the row and column index respectively .",
    "for instance , if the output - port one is the only one being projected onto a single qubit , and input ports one and two are open to alice and bob whilst the rest are injected by vacuum state , then the active submatrix is @xmath136 if , in addition , charlie decides to inject a single photon into the port three , then the resulting active submatrix will be @xmath137    in the general scenario , we inject @xmath0 single - photons into @xmath0 principal modes , extracting a bit of each photon and processing them through a unitary of size @xmath1 . the ports @xmath138 of @xmath139 are dedicated to principal inputs , the ports @xmath140 are injected with ancillary single photons and the remaining @xmath3 with ancillary vacua . at the output , single - qubit and vacuum measurements",
    "are performed on the ports @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "note that it is required to have @xmath143 , otherwise there would be no @xmath144 component in the output .",
    "the projector @xmath145 in this case will have coefficients of the form    @xmath146    where the sums run over all the permutations @xmath36 of @xmath4 index numbers .",
    "evidently , the size of the active submatrix is @xmath147 .    according to eq  , to determine the elements of the active submatrix @xmath148 and",
    "@xmath139 one should solve a set of polynomial equations of degree at most @xmath149 over complex numbers and optimize the probability of success .",
    "the question is whether or not we can determine if the set of equations obtained by comparing eq",
    ".   with the coefficients of any arbitrary target state possesses a solution and if so , can we find it ?",
    "this question can be answered for complex variables using the well - known grbner basis and elimination techniques  @xcite . however , as noted in  @xcite , there is generally no efficient algorithm to calculate solutions to such sets of equation .",
    "furthermore , we can note from eq .",
    "that merely writing down the problem to be solved is inefficient as in principle there may be exponentially many @xmath150 coefficients .",
    "if we posed a problem restricted to polynomially many @xmath150 s , then the sum over the entire symmetric group will be exponentially large .",
    "finally , even if there were only polynomially many non - zero @xmath151 s and @xmath152 s we are still left with evaluating matrix permanents , a problem known to be classically hard to compute , over polynomials of the unknown elements of the active submatrix @xmath148 . as a consequence",
    ", we are encountering a _ verification problem_. therefore , the solution to the posed problem , although it might exist , can not be efficiently found",
    ". however , it is interesting to note that , in the case where there is polynomially many @xmath150 coefficients and a polynomial error bound , a universal quantum computer would very likely be able to implement the projector @xmath145 on qubits efficiently .",
    "the other important question is how does the success probability scale ? unfortunately there is no unique answer to this question , because the success probability strongly depends on the target state .",
    "for example , preparing @xmath0-mode separable single - photon or vacuum state is trivially possible with success probability of @xmath153 irrespective of the number of modes or measurements .",
    "similarly , assuming that we could perform deterministic single - qubit measurements at the output of @xmath139 , by making use of a feed - forward strategy and correcting the phase at the output , the probability of success for preparing any @xmath0-mode separable state would be equal to one . including the success probability of the single - qubit measurements",
    ", however , causes the scale of the scheme to be @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the success probability of one single - qubit measurement , even for generating separable states .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a technique for the generation of arbitrary multi - qubit quantum states using linear optics and heralding measurements in a single - rail encoding scenario .",
    "our approach avoids any multi - photon terms at the output .",
    "we explicitly showed that our scheme leads to the set of equations , involving permanents of a submatrix of the linear optical network , which is solvable for a small number of qubits .",
    "in particular , we solved the problem for generalized cluster states of two- and three - qubits as target states and obtained a heralding probability for our universal scheme which is comparable to the state - of - the - art proposals for specific states alone .",
    "we also considered the scalability of our scheme and discussed the efficiency of finding a solution to the general set of equations from various perspectives .",
    "it turned out that a universal quantum computer is the only hope for solving the general problem .",
    "our proposal thus can be reliably used for sharing universal multi - qubit quantum states between a few number of parties . moreover",
    ", it can be applied equally to other quantum optical systems such as opto - mechanics and spin ensembles .",

    "this gives the _ unique _ solution for @xmath159 and putting it back into @xmath161 gives the solution for @xmath158 .",
    "a simple calculation then leads to @xmath172 now , we have both solutions in terms of the remaining free variable , @xmath160 . note that @xmath173 is determined from conditions on @xmath48 .",

    "notably to say , there is also a second method to prove that the set   has a solution , and that is to show that the macaulay s resultant of the set is zero ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed account of the method ) .",
    "let us consider the general case of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "an arbitrary state has @xmath174 free complex coefficients . therefore , we need a unitary of the size @xmath134 such that it has enough free magnitude and phase degrees of freedom . any @xmath175 unitary has @xmath176 free parameters , @xmath177 of which are magnitudes and @xmath134 of them phases .",
    "one should also notice that one of the phases is global which makes the difference between @xmath139 and @xmath178 ( the @xmath175 special unitary matrices ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath134 must satisfy @xmath179 we note that the second condition has the a slower growth in @xmath134 , and thus determines @xmath134 as @xmath180 for @xmath181 there is no need for a unitary at all , since there is enough degrees of freedom in measurement and pick - off .",
    "besides this general consideration , @xmath134 could be chosen to be smaller or larger based on the particular value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because for @xmath134 to have enough free parameters is necessary , but the more important is to chose the active submatrix of the right dimensions to involve enough free parameters in the equations .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath182 of sec .",
    "[ po ] , the coefficient @xmath183 is uniquely determined via the measurements ; cf .",
    ". thus , the global phase of the unitary can effectively cause a relative phase between @xmath184 term and the rest . as a result , instead of a @xmath185",
    ", a @xmath125 delivers enough free parameters when a @xmath186 active submatrix is chosen .",
    "to solve eqs .   and   numerically , we follow the procedure :    1 .",
    "solve the first equation in   for @xmath28 in terms of @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   solve the second equation in   for @xmath187 in terms of @xmath188 .",
    "3 .   substitute the results into the third equation and solve it for @xmath188 to obtain it as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "4 .   substitute the result back into the second equation to transform @xmath187 in terms of @xmath30 . at this stage , we have all the parameters as functions of variables @xmath189 , and @xmath190",
    "notice that @xmath191 is directly given in terms of @xmath30 from the first constraint in  , since @xmath188 is obtained in step ( 3 )",
    "now , we are left with two unknowns , @xmath30 and @xmath192 .",
    "they can be obtained from the second and third constraints in  .",
    "however , we prefer to calculate @xmath192 from the last one in terms of @xmath30 .",
    "7 .   as the last step",
    ", we run an optimization of the success probability , eq .  , over variables @xmath189 , and @xmath190 constrained to the second condition in eq .  .",
    "here we give our numerical result for the @xmath48 leading the highest probability of success for generating a two - qubit cluster state ( see eq .  ) of @xmath101 and @xmath86 .",
