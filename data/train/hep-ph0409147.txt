    "the simplest model is based on an su(5 ) group  @xcite . in spite of the theoretical appeal",
    ", there have been several puzzles in construction of supersymmetric gut models : the first puzzle is the higgs sector . in general , the very complicated and innovative higgs sector should be considered .",
    "the gut gauge breaking usually requires the higgs field(s ) in the adjoint or higher - dimensional representation(s ) .",
    "in particular , the most annoying difficulty is the mass splitting between higgs weak - doublets and color - triplets .",
    "various mechanisms for this problem have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "the second one concerns the matter sector .",
    "quarks and leptons are unified into irreducible representation(s ) of the gut group .",
    "this matter unification ensures the electric charge quantization , but also predicts a promising mass relation , @xmath4 , in the simplest su(5 ) model .",
    "however , it predicts also the unwanted mass relations , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are badly broken in nature .",
    "moreover , recent neutrino experiments  @xcite reveal that the neutrinos own non - zero masses which are much smaller than the electron mass , and remarkably that the mixing angles in the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations are both large .",
    "the rest angle is only limited by experiment  @xcite .",
    "we then have to explain small and large mixing angles in the quark - lepton sector at the same time .",
    "the observed fermion properties may also require the gut models to be complicated .",
    "one way to evade these issues is to give up the fundamental assumption  a simple group  , @xmath7 , to go into the product group like @xmath8 or @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the gut gauge groups  @xcite . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite the class of these models , called the product - group unification , still preserves the nice features of the guts .",
    "namely , the standard gauge group is contained in the diagonal subgroup , and hence the coupling unification is realized at tree - level . in addition",
    ", quarks and leptons are unified in each gut group @xmath10 , and the electric charge quantization is also explained .",
    "there are three major advantages in the product - group unification : first , the breaking of gauge symmetry is accomplished without introducing the higgs fields in the adjoint or higher - dimensional representations  @xcite .",
    "this seems very promising for the connection to the string theory .",
    "in fact , it is known that there is no state in the adjoint or higher representation in the string spectrum with the affine level one  @xcite .",
    "second , the doublet - triplet problem may receive a natural solution by the use of the discrete symmetry  @xcite .- symmetry is used for the doublet - triplet splitting  @xcite . ] finally , we may gain important insights to the flavor physics .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the usual guts ( as well as the standard model ) to understand the origin of the hierarchical structure in the yukawa couplings , which are essentially free parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass hierarchy between different flavors may be explained by the breaking of the product group when they belong to different gut group factors  @xcite .",
    "this illustrates the idea of refs .",
    "@xcite in the unified theories .",
    "moreover , the discrete symmetry for the doublet - triplet splitting can be utilized as the horizontal flavor symmetry , which is also crucial for the suppression of the dimension - five operators to avoid a rapid proton decay  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we present an explicit model for realistic fermion masses based on the product group su(5)@xmath0su(5)@xmath0su(5 ) .",

    "@xcite , the model in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to the small angles for neutrino mixing , and in ref .",
    "@xcite the neutrino physics has not been discussed .",
    "our model is constructed by imposing the discrete symmetries @xmath1 , where the @xmath11 symmetry is introduced to solve the doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "the observed masses and flavor mixing of quarks and leptons , including neutrinos , are well described by the breaking of the product gauge group together with these discrete symmetries .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath11 breaking is crucial for generating ( _ i _ ) an effective @xmath3-term for the higgs doublets , ( _ ii _ ) the charged fermion mass hierarchies , and ( _ iii _ ) the majorana masses for right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we point out that the @xmath3-parameter at the weak scale is suggested from not only the observed masses of charged fermions , but also the neutrino masses indicated by the oscillation experiments .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in the next section , we first present our model based on a product group su(5)@xmath0su(5)@xmath0su(5 ) . in particular , the gauge symmetry breaking and the doublet - triplet splitting are discussed . in sec .",

    "in this article we will investigate a supersymmetric model based on a product group : @xmath15 one of the advantages in this class of models based on product groups is that the gauge symmetry breaking can be achieved without introducing higgs fields in the adjoint or higher - dimensional representations .",
    "in fact , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bifundamental fields are sufficient for this task .",

    "the breaking of the group @xmath10 into the standard model group su(3)@xmath0su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) is achieved by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of these fields :    [ eq : vev_bfh ] @xmath21    where we take all the vevs are real and positive .",
    "these bifundamental fields play also an important rle for fermion masses and mixing . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : massmixing ] , the observational data suggest the scale of the vevs is typically of the order of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the cut - off scale which is taken as the reduced planck scale in this analysis ) .",

    "the above vevs might be determined by a superpotential for the bifundamental fields .",
    "such a superpotential should avoid the appearance of the massless nambu - goldstone fields .",
    "the standard model group is embedded in a diagonal su(5 ) group of @xmath10 , and the gauge coupling unification is ensured at the leading order , although we have to include the threshold corrections around the @xmath10 breaking scale . in this article , we will not discuss these issues , but we assume the vevs as in eqs .",

    "@xmath24      one of the serious difficulties in construction of gut models is the doublet - triplet splitting in higgs masses .",
    "there exist two weak - doublets of higgs fields , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are superfields whose vevs give masses to up- and down - type quarks , respectively .",
    "we incorporate these higgs doublets by introducing @xmath27 together with color - triplet higgs @xmath28 and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are @xmath32 and @xmath33-plets of su(5)@xmath14 and su(5)@xmath34 , respectively .",
    "it should be emphasized that the gauge symmetry @xmath10 forbids an invariant mass term for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , however , the terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 are allowed in the superpotential .",
    "although the former term is desirable to give a heavy mass to the color - triplet higgs , the latter should be forbidden to leave the weak - doublet higgs massless below the @xmath10 breaking scale .",
    "how can we distinguish the weak - doublet higgs from the color - triplet higgs in a natural way ?",
    "the doublet - triplet splitting can be realized by using a discrete symmetry in the framework of the product - group unification  @xcite .",
    "here we shall follow the discussion of ref .",
    "such a symmetry can be constructed from a usual discrete symmetry @xmath37 and a discrete `` hypercharge '' subgroup of u(1)@xmath38 su(5)@xmath34 or u(1)@xmath39 su(5)@xmath14 . in the present model",
    "we choose that of u(1)@xmath34 for example .",

    "in fact , if it is the case , the term @xmath36 will be absent in the superpotential , while the following term is still allowed @xmath53 which generates a heavy mass of @xmath54 to the color - triplet higgs .",

    "finally , three gauge - singlet fields @xmath72 ( right - handed neutrinos ) are introduced to generate neutrino masses .",

    "all other yukawa couplings are induced effectively by the @xmath10 breaking and are suppressed by some powers of vevs of the bifundamental fields .",
    "this accounts for , at the first approximation , a large top - quark mass and smaller masses for the other fermions .",
    "second , our model offers naturally the so - called `` lopsided family structure ''  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of @xmath70 under @xmath10 is different from that of @xmath79 to cancel the gauge anomalies .",
    "this may be the reason why there is a difference in the mass hierarchies between up- and down - type quarks .",
    "more importantly , the same gauge charge between @xmath80 and @xmath81 may ensure a large @xmath82-@xmath83 mixing angle confirmed in the atmospheric neutrino oscillation .",
    "in this section we present fermion mass matrices in our model . as discussed above , the product gauge group @xmath10 is considered as the flavor symmetry .",

    "<S> we discuss a supersymmetric unified model based on a product gauge group su(5)@xmath0su(5)@xmath0su(5 ) , where the gauge symmetry breaking is achieved without the adjoint or higher - dimensional higgs field , and the doublet - triplet splitting in the higgs masses is realized by the use of the discrete symmetry . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we present an explicit model for realistic fermion masses with the discrete symmetries @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that all the observed masses and mixing angles for quarks and leptons , including neutrinos , are well described by the breaking of the symmetries imposed in the model . </S>",
    "<S> especially , the maximal and large mixing angles in the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations are obtained as the most preferred values , and the typical value of the neutrino mixing element @xmath2 is 0.10.3 . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out the non - trivial relations among the @xmath3-parameter for the higgs mass , the charged fermion hierarchies , and the neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> these relations suggest that the scale of @xmath3 is of order of the weak scale . </S>"
