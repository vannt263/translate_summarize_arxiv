    "third , the possible operation frequencies of the proposed structure are limited by graphene quality and the intrinsic behaviour of tm spps . on the one hand ,",
    "the minimum operating frequency is within the low terahertz band ( @xmath115 0.5thz ) where graphene losses start to considerably increase and the surface reactance can not be widely tuned by applying reduced dc voltages . on the other hand , the maximum operating frequency is predicted to be at few tenths of thz . at these frequencies ,",
    "the plasmons are extremely confined at the graphene sheet and the dimensions of the polysilicon pads become really small to be implemented with current manufacturing processes .",

    "a back - metallized bare si p - type wafer can be employed as sacrificial substrate , covered by two dielectric layers ( conducting polysilicon and sio2 ) by using a deposition process . before depositing the sio2",

    "then , graphene is transferred onto the stacks .",
    "metalling contact must be defined at the edge of the polysilicon pads by using optical lithography , followed by the evaporation of gold with a chromium adhesive layer and a lift - off process @xcite .",
    "it is also important to mention that the fringing electrostatic fields between consecutive polysilicon pads can be neglected and , therefore , they do not perturb the conductivity profile along the z - axis on graphene .",
    "first , it is shown in @xcite that a finite - width gating pad imposes a _ soft _ boundary condition on the graphene sheet , leading to a smooth conductivity profile .",
    "second , in order to provide a sinusoidal modulation of graphene s surface reactance , consecutive pads are dc biased with relatively similar voltages ( as graphically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : reconf ] ) thus reducing even more the possible influence of the fringing fields .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that no power handling issues are foreseen in the proposed antenna structure .",
    "similar mono - layer configurations have been studied and measured exhibiting really good performances in terms of thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "a graphene leaky - wave antenna which allows electronic beamscanning at a single frequency has been proposed .",
    "its radiation principle is based on sinusoidally - modulated reactance surfaces which can be easily implemented using a graphene sheet thanks to its tunable characteristics when applying electric field biasing .",
    "this novel antenna concept offers unprecedented performances at the thz band such as electronic control of several radiation characteristics preserving a radiation efficiency above 10@xmath98 .",
    "the main limitations in its design are imposed by graphene properties ( such as the relaxation time @xmath10 ) , the range of feasible voltages that can be applied to the gating pads , and the availability of substrates in the thz band .",
