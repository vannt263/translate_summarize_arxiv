    "bright points ( bps ) are frequently detected as the small scale brightness enhancements on solar disk .",
    "different from the larger scale solar burst phenomena , i.e. , flares and cmes , they are very common phenomena in the active regions , quiet sun or even coronal holes . the bps are usually observed at the solar atmosphere , i.e. , from photosphere through chromosphere to corona .",
    "the bps observed at x - rays @xcite , extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) @xcite , and ultraviolet ( uv ) @xcite bands are generally called coronal bright points ( cbps ) .",
    "they usually display the small roundish or loop - shaped features .",
    "the cbps have a typical size of about 5@xmath240 , and they can last for a few hours or longer @xcite .",
    "statistical results indicate that about 1500 cbps emergence at the full solar surface every day @xcite .",
    "and further studies suggest that there are 800 cbps emergence on the entire solar surface at any given time @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are thought to be contributed to the coronal heating .",
    "however , the number and distribution of the cbps on solar atmospheres are different between solar maximum and minimum years . in other words , there are much more cbps emergence at sunspot minimum than that at sunspot maximum , and they appear more uniformly during solar minimum over the solar surface . the number of the cbps becomes less when their lifetimes are longer @xcite . on the other hands , previous studies have found that the temperature of the cbps is about several mk , while their electron density has an order of @xmath010@xmath3  @xmath4 , which corresponds to the emission measure ( em ) of about 10@xmath5 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the cbps are usually believed to be the results of the small - scale magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "observations show that the cbps are always associated with the small - scale magnetic fields which have opposite - polarity poles @xcite .",
    "and these small magnetic fields are always new emergence and have the fluxes of about 10@xmath7@xmath210@xmath8 mx @xcite .",
    "previous findings further indicated that one third of the cbps occur at the new ephemeral magnetic regions , whereas the other two thirds of them are lied above the cancelations of the opposite - polarity magnetic fields @xcite . using the observations with high time resolution ,",
    "several authors have investigated the relationship between the cbps and the moving behaviors of magnetic fields ( or the change of the magnetic flux ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they found that the cbp is associated with magnetic cancelation .",
    "all these findings support the magnetic reconnection model for the cbps . based on the 2-d reconnection model @xcite , the bi - directional outflows can be produced simultaneously , and the radiation along their propagation path",
    "could be observed at euv or optical wavelengths .",
    "for example , the bi - directional outflows are well detected in the transition - region explosive events @xcite and solar flares @xcite .",
    "the reconnections flows are called as the downflows and upflows according to the moving directions ( toward or away ) from the solar surface .",
    "similar as the quasi - periodic oscillations in the solar flare @xcite , some cbps also display the quasi - periodic oscillations , such as the periodic variation in intensity and doppler shifts at x - ray and euv bands @xcite , or the repeated bi - directional flows at euv bands @xcite .",
    "the periods of these oscillations are ranging from seconds to tens of minutes .",
    "for example , @xcite detected the quasi - periods between 80 and 100  s at 9 aia euv ( or uv ) bands in a curved cbp . while @xcite found the intensity oscillations with long periods ranging from 8 to 64  min in the cbps .",
    "recently , @xcite found the correlation between the imaging intensity and the spectral line parameters in a cbp .",
    "all these findings suggest that the quasi - periodic oscillations in the cbp could be explained by the repetitive and small - scale magnetic reconnections on the solar surface @xcite . and",
    "the observed period could be the same as that of the modulated mhd waves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also consistent well with the 2-d reconnection model @xcite .    using the observations from soho / sumer @xcite ,",
    "the studies of the bi - directional outflows had been breakthrough .",
    "however , these phenomena are mostly in the short - time scale , such as explosive events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , chromospheric upflow events @xcite , and blinkers @xcite .",

    "[ snap ] just displays the cbp evolution at aia 171  . in order to display this cbp at other wavelengths ,",

    "[ cbp ] and [ snap ] . here",
    "we use a constant width of @xmath012  in order to cover the bulk of the cbp brightness as much as possible during its lifetime at various wavelengths .",
    "secondly , the intensities between these two dashed curves are integrated .",
    "thus , we can obtain the time - distance slices of the intensities at 7 aia euv bands and 2 sji fuv channels , as shown in fig .",
    "the y - axis is the artificial slit from southeast ( bottom ) to northwest ( top ) .",

    "the moving structures from the cbp core are identified as the oblique streaks on the time - distance slices .",
    "they are considered as the flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the flows are still identified as the oblique streaks , which are shown clearly and each one is labeled by the arrow . in this case , one flow is divided into two streaks , a white streak followed by a dark one .",
    "similar as the method used to study the thread in a prominence @xcite , a pair of white and dark streaks here are consistent with the movement of a pair of white and dark kernels on the running - difference images in fig .",

    "the region of p2 is located at the cbp core , while p1 and p3 regions are outside of the cbp .",

    "similarly for the em , p1 and p3 regions reach their peak values after the cbp core ( p2 ) , and the peak em at the cbp core is almost at the same time as the aia 171  maximum brightness ( blue profile ) .",

    "<S> we report the bi - directional moving structures in a coronal bright point ( cbp ) on 2015 july 14 . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed by the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) onboard _ solar dynamics observatory ( sdo)_. this cbp has a lifetime of @xmath010 minutes , and a curved shape . </S>",
    "<S> the observations show that many bright structures are moving intermittently outward from the cbp brightness core . </S>",
    "<S> such moving structures are clearly seen at aia 171   , 193   , 211   , 131   , 94   , 335   and 304   , slit - jaw ( sji ) 1330   and 1400   . in order to analyze these moving structures , </S>",
    "<S> the cbp is cut along the moving direction with a curved slit from the aia and sji images . </S>",
    "<S> then we can obtain the time - distance slices , including the intensity and intensity - derivative diagrams , from which , the moving structures are recognized as the oblique streaks , and they are characterized by the bi - direction , simultaneity , symmetry , and periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> the average speed is around 300  km  s@xmath1 , while the typically period is @xmath090  s. all these features ( including the bi - directional flows and their periodicity ) can be detected simultaneously at all the 9 wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> this cbp takes place at the site between a small pair of magnetic polarities . </S>",
    "<S> high time resolution observations show that they are moving close to each other during its lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> these facts support the magnetic reconnection model of the cbp and the bi - directional moving structures could be the observational outflows after the reconnection </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , they can be as the direct observation evidence of the magnetic reconnection . </S>"
