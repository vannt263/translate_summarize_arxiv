    "the past two decades has witnessed a revolution in the study of faint galaxies . with the advent of larger telescopes , more efficient detectors and new observing techniques , we are now able to reach stars down to fainter limiting magnitudes over large areas of the sky . in recent years",
    ", the complex nature of dwarf galaxies has consequently become apparent .",
    "historically , dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies were seen essentially as large , diffuse globular clusters , uncomplicated structures consisting of a single - age stellar population .",
    "this view has been changed on several fronts . in terms of star formation",
    ", @xcite first showed that the stellar population of the carina dsph is complex .",
    "subsequently , the star formation histories of nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been revealed to be complex and varying from system to system .",
    "for example , whereas the ursa minor dsph consists mainly of old stars @xcite , @xmath6 of the stars in leo i formed in the last seven billion years @xcite .",
    "the importance of dwarf galaxies in the dark matter regime has also become apparent .",
    "measurements of individual stellar velocities in the dsph systems reveal that they are surprisingly massive for their luminosity",
    ". the optical mass - to - light ratios of some dwarf galaxies are found to be @xmath5@xmath7 or more , indicating that these objects are dominated by dark matter . indeed , dwarf galaxies are the darkest objects in the universe which we can directly observe",
    ". the velocity profiles of these objects are flat ( for example , @xcite ) , revealing that the dark halos of dwarf galaxies extend beyond the detected limits of the luminous material .",
    "that is , the luminous material of dwarf galaxies is only a minor component of such objects .    in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "scenario , fluctuations in the power spectrum during the early times of the universe resulted in small clumps of dark matter with masses @xmath5@xmath8 ( for example , @xcite and references therein ) . by redshift @xmath9",
    ", dwarf galaxies have formed through the merger of these small dark halos .",
    "indeed , @xcite predict that despite existing for several crossing times , the inner region of isolated dark halos should exhibit little structural evolution after @xmath10 .",
    "the majority of these dwarf galaxies were not sufficiently isolated to survive to the present day , and have since merged to form the large scale structure now visible .",
    "therefore , the dwarf galaxies currently orbiting the galaxy are survivors from this merger process , and are thought to be only a small part of the original low - mass galaxy population .    hence , dwarf galaxies provide the link between smaller and larger structures .",
    "if dwarf galaxies are built up through the accretion of smaller dark halos , it may be possible to find the primordial building blocks in the local universe @xcite .",
    "@xcite claim to have found an relic from the epoch of dwarf galaxy formation in the nearby satellite in ursa minor ( umi ) in the form of a dense , kinematically cold population of stars , although the presence of dm in umi has not been categorically proven @xcite .",
    "assuming these stars trace the distribution of underlying dark material , then this clump represents a density spike in the distribution of dark matter outside the centre of umi .",
    "however , although dwarf galaxies are considered to have formed through the merger of smaller systems , such interactions are generally thought to be confined to the early epoch of the universe .",
    "in contrast , a clump of stars detected in fornax @xcite was interpreted to be the remnant of the merger between two dsph - sized objects as little as 2 gyr ago .",
    "this may be related to the enhanced period of star formation found by @xcite , occuring approximately @xmath11 gyr ago in concert with a period of increased metal enrichment .",
    "hence , fornax could be an important test object for recent dwarf galaxy interactions .",
    "measuring structural parameters is difficult for nearby dwarf galaxies , since relatively deep , wide - field data are required for these extended , low surface brightness objects .",
    "however , the structure of satellite systems may be used to examine properties of the galaxy",
    ". simulations @xcite predict that the structure of these satellites will be distorted by tidal forces as they orbit the host object . an extreme form of such structural distortion is evident in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite and the globular cluster palomar 5 @xcite .",
    "these two objects have lost a significant portion of their stars to tidal tails caused by the galactic tidal field .",
    "several authors have shown that the shape and kinematics of these tails can be used to trace the distribution of dark matter throughout both the host and satellite @xcite .",
    "also , as the host tidal field heats the satellite , its survivability is highly dependent on its dark matter distribution ( for example , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , although fornax is situated far from the galaxy , it may be possible to detect the first signs of heating due to the galactic tidal field by studying the outer structure of this dsph .    in this paper ,",
    "we describe a wide - field survey of the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "the aim of this investigation was to search for substructure in fornax , especially in the poorly - mapped outer regions .",
    "our goal was to determine if fornax has a recent merger history , and relate this to its most recent star formation history , and to examine whether the galactic tidal field is heating the outer regions of this dsph . a short description of some of these results",
    "is given in @xcite ; here we present a comprehensive analysis .",
    "section 2 describes previous studies of fornax , and summarises its stellar population , structure and kinematics .",
    "section 3 details the fornax survey , describing the observations and data reduction .",
    "the photometry and calibration is detailed in  4 , and  5 examines the results of the survey .",
    "an analysis of the outer and inner region of fornax is presented in ",
    " 6 and 7 respectively , and we conclude in ",
    " 8 and 9 .",
    "the fornax dsph galaxy was first detected on harvard blue photographic plates as a diffuse system which could be separated into individual stars only by the most powerful telescopes of the time @xcite . with an integrated @xmath0-band magnitude of @xmath12 and a mass ( including dark matter ) calculated from the best fit king profile to be @xmath13 @xcite",
    ", fornax is the most massive known object of this type orbiting the galaxy , excluding the disrupting sagittarius dsph .",
    "the integrated absolute magnitude of fornax makes it more luminous than all the other eight known galactic dsphs put together ( excluding sagittarius ) .",
    "fornax covers a large area on the sky , with a tidal radius of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it is situated at a distance of @xmath15 kpc @xcite , and hence the linear tidal radius is @xmath16 kpc .",
    "dwarf galaxies are typically small , diffuse systems , yet can contain complex star formation histories .",
    "the star formation history of fornax appears to be unusually complex in comparison to most other dwarf galaxies . @xcite",
    "first detected an extended giant branch in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , possibly made up of carbon stars .",
    "these were later spectroscopically confirmed by @xcite .",
    "more recent deep studies have covered a large area of fornax and found the intermediate - age ( @xmath17 gyr ) stars are the dominant population .",
    "@xcite covered an area approximately 1/3 deg@xmath2 down to a depth of @xmath18 , revealing the intricate history of star formation in fornax .",
    "this , combined with a more recent study by @xcite , indicated that the stars in fornax can be divided into three main classes : ( i ) an old population ( age @xmath19 gyr ) identified by the old horizontal branch , the old red giant branch ( rgb ) and rr lyrae stars ; ( ii ) an intermediate - age population , represented by the upper asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , part of the rgb , and the red clump , and ; ( iii ) a population of young ( age @xmath20 gyr ) main sequence stars .",
    "the position of a star in the rgb reflects its age and metallicity , although these quantities exhibit a degeneracy in this region of the cmd .",
    "therefore , using the position and width of the rgb can lead to erroneous estimates of the metallicity ( or metallicity spread ) in a system possessing a substantial intermediate age population such as fornax .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by collecting spectra for rgb stars , which allows an independent determination of the mean abundance ( and its dispersion ) in a stellar system .",
    "once these parameters are known for a large sample of stars , the chemical enrichment history of the stellar system may be pieced together .",
    "consequently , @xcite collected spectra for 32 stars in fornax and determined the mean heavy - metal abundance from the ca ii triplet to be @xmath21[fe / h]@xmath22 , with the bulk of fornax stars between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite repeated this experiment with 117 red giants towards the centre of fornax , finding evidence of metal - rich population ( @xmath25 [ fe / h ] @xmath26 ) with ages @xmath27 gyr .",
    "they conclude that the age - metallicity relation for fornax is complex , and that the system has experienced a significant period of metal enrichment in the last few gyr .",
    "@xcite also find that the chemical enrichment history of fornax makes it more comparable to the lmc or the galactic disk rather than the remainder of the galactic dsph population .    in summary , the star formation of fornax appears to have begun approximately 12 gyr ago and has continued almost to the present day .",
    "saviane et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimate stars in the blue main sequence may be as young as 200 myr .",
    "@xcite find that the metal abundance rose to [ fe / h ] @xmath28 within the first few gigayears , and that the last @xmath54 gyr have seen a significant increase in chemical enrichment .",
    "while the formation of stars in fornax appears to have been a relatively continuous process @xcite , @xcite find evidence for gaps in the sub - giant branch , possibly indicating breaks in the star formation . indeed",
    ", the well - populated subgiant branch indicates a significant population with an age of @xmath11 gyr .",
    "stetson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed that the recent star formation in fornax occurred in the central regions .",
    "however , @xcite searched the same area and was unable to detect a corresponding supply of neutral hydrogen , inferring that the burst of star formation has ionised the gas or possibly ejected it beyond their search area .",
    "an hi survey of the fornax region over a wider field did not detect a significant amount of neutral hydrogen ( bouchard 2004 , personal communication ) .",
    "the various stellar populations show different spatial distributions throughout fornax .",
    "the old and intermediate populations , represented by the rr lyrae variables and red clump stars respectively , have the most extended distribution .",
    "conversely , the young main sequence stars are more centrally concentrated , appearing to define a bar with the position angle of the major axis offset by approximately @xmath29 from that of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "there is also the possibility that the young stars are concentrated towards both ends of this bar , suggesting a `` bilateral rather than a rotationally symmetric structure '' ( stetson et al .",
    "thus , recent star formation has occurred irregularly throughout fornax .",
    "in addition , first results from the current program @xcite indicated an apparent association of young stars located approximately @xmath30 from the centre of fornax , using the data of stetson et al .",
    "this feature is aligned with the major axis , located on the minor axis and appears shell - like in nature .",
    "our inference was that it represented shell structure in fornax . if true , this is the first such discovery in a dwarf galaxy , and probably represents a merger between fornax and another gas - rich companion approximately 2 gyr ago . in such an interaction ,",
    "perturbation of the neutral hydrogen may well lead to an accelerated star formation rate consistent with that observed by @xcite .",
    "the first study of the structure of fornax was by @xcite using star counts from photographic plates .",
    "hodge constructed a radial profile and contour plot for fornax , noting two main points concerning its structure : ( i ) the ellipticity increased with increasing radius , and ; ( ii ) an asymmetry , such that the point of highest density was offset from the centre by @xmath5@xmath31 .",
    "two later studies @xcite used photoelectric surface photometry to map the structure of fornax .",
    "both confirmed the asymmetry found by @xcite , however these studies were hindered by the faint surface brightness of fornax .",
    "more recent analyses @xcite have used wide - field photographic plate data to search for substructure and extra - tidal stars in fornax .",
    "although these studies have confirmed the asymmetry in the inner regions ( @xmath32 ) , the presence of otherwise extra - tidal stars remains controversial .",
    "@xcite estimate their detection of fornax stars outside the nominal tidal radius at the @xmath33 significance level . a recent ccd - based survey by @xcite covered an area @xmath34 deg@xmath2 around fornax in the @xmath0-band .",
    "they did not find evidence of extra - tidal stars , however they claim a significantly increased tidal radius of @xmath35 .",
    "hence , the possible tidal distortion of fornax by the galaxy is still to be constrained .",
    "the kinematics of fornax may provide some insight into the structural development of this dsph .",
    "however , the low heliocentric velocity ( @xmath36 km s@xmath37 ; @xcite ) makes fornax unsuitable for large - scale intermediate - resolution spectroscopy with the aim of measuring radial velocities .",
    "in addition , high s / n spectra of a large number of stars in fornax are difficult to obtain due to its relatively large distance of 138 kpc @xcite .",
    "consequently , dynamical studies of fornax have been limited to an analysis of upper rgb stellar velocities . @xcite",
    "collected echelle spectroscopy of 44 stars located in two fields of fornax ; one located at the centre and the other approximately two core radii sw along the major axis from the centre of fornax . rejecting some stars",
    "based on radial velocities and photometry , they found the central velocity dispersion of fornax to be @xmath38 km s@xmath37 .",
    "these results imply a mass - to - light ratio of at least 5.3 , and possibly as high as 26 .",
    "the large range in these values is a result of the range of published central surface brightness values @xcite .",
    "hence , fornax appears to contain a significant amount of dark matter ; @xcite estimate at least @xmath39 of the _ central _ mass of fornax is dark .",
    "the analysis also found the velocity dispersion of the outer field to be similar to that of the central field , suggesting a flat velocity dispersion profile for the luminous material .",
    "this is unlike a @xcite model ; a tidally truncated isotropic system in which mass follows light has a declining velocity dispersion with increasing radius .",
    "consequently , the dark halo appears to be more extended than the visible component , and may dominate the dynamics of fornax at all scales .",
    "the structural and dynamical history of fornax is still to be fully determined .",
    "previous studies have found evidence of substructure in the inner regions , and possible fornax stars lying beyond the nominal boundary of the system .",
    "these may be indications of the perturbation suffered by fornax under the gravitational influence of the galaxy .",
    "however , the attempt to find fornax structure outside the nominal tidal radius has been limited by the low surface brightness of the region . at radii approaching the tidal radius the star counts fall into the noise of the background sources .    an effective method to increase the",
    "signal - to - noise of stellar counts in the outer regions of nearby systems is to use the cmd to detect candidate extra - tidal stars @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for recent examples of this process .",
    "we have compiled a multi - colour spatial map of fornax using a mosaic of ccd observations .",
    "the inner regions provided a cmd of fornax , which was used to select candidate fornax stars beyond its nominal tidal boundary , thereby reducing contamination from background and foreground sources , and resulting in a better model of the outer structure of the object .",
    "this is the first such survey of the fornax dsph galaxy .",
    "the fornax dsph covers a relatively large area on the sky , with a major axis length of approximately @xmath40 .",
    "hence , a complete map of this object requires a survey region several degrees across .",
    "ccd images were obtained with the siding spring observatory 1 metre telescope using the wide - field imager ( wfi ) , which comprises eight 4096 @xmath41 2048 ccds arranged in a @xmath42 mosaic to give a total format of 8192 @xmath41 8192 pixels .",
    "this gives a field - of - view of @xmath43 arcmin@xmath2 at a scale of @xmath44 per pixel , ideal for covering large areas of the sky to a reasonable depth .",
    "a @xmath45 grid of fields centred on fornax was observed over four observation runs between october 2001 and december 2003 ( table [ fornaxobservations ] ) , covering an area of @xmath46 on the sky .",
    "a @xmath47 overlap region between adjacent fields was used to determine the internal astrometric precision and to ensure the photometric zeropoint was constant across the survey .",
    "a map of these fields is given in fig .",
    "[ obsmap ] , where the sixteen fields are labelled @xmath48 .",
    "each field was observed in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands . the red giant branch ( rgb ) of fornax",
    "is located in the approximate magnitude range @xmath49 at a colour of @xmath50 . to accurately map the fornax rgb stars , errors less than 0.05 mag ( an approximate signal - to - noise ratio of 25 )",
    "were required down to magnitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , multiple images were recorded for each field with total exposure times of 2400s in @xmath0 and 1800s in @xmath1 . by coadding the images , effects such as cosmic rays and satellite trails",
    "were removed .",
    "the exposure times for each field are listed in table [ fornaxobservations ] .",
    "poor seeing was compensated by taking an extra exposure of the relevant field ( for example , see field 15 in table [ fornaxobservations ] ) .",
    "the tracking of the telescope was found to deteriorate with increasing zenith distance .",
    "therefore , if the desired field was located @xmath52 hours from the meridian , the exposure times were halved and the number of exposures were doubled . additionally , during periods of good observing conditions ( seeing approaching @xmath53 ) , guide stars were used to reduce the effect of telescope tracking on the star profiles .",
    "image reduction was accomplished using standard routines in the image reduction and analysis facility program following the standard procedure .",
    "the bias images and overscan region were subtracted from all object and flat field exposures .",
    "all object images were divided by the appropriate combined twilight flat field , accounting for variations in ccd pixel sensitivity .",
    "the images were also divided by a secondary dark sky flat , a median combination of long exposures from each of the sixteen pointings listed in table [ fornaxobservations ] .",
    "each image was split into its eight ccd component parts .",
    "the eight ccd images were then individually registered with all other ccd images for that field , by comparing the pixel coordinates of several bright stars .",
    "the ccd images were median combined to create the final object image , where the final images only included stars falling in the common areas of each exposure . by ensuring that the maximum offset between each frame was less than 30 pixels , the amount of sky coverage lost was limited to @xmath54 of the wfi frame .",
    "wfi has a ` filling factor ' of approximately @xmath55 , therefore the fornax survey covered approximately @xmath56 of the desired area .",
    "an astrometric calibration was made using the first usno ccd astrograph catalogue ( ucac1 ; @xcite ) , which is estimated to have an average precision of 31 mas in the magnitude range @xmath57 . to test astrometric accuracy ,",
    "stars were matched in the overlap regions of the fornax survey .",
    "this was accomplished by searching for a neighbour within @xmath58 of each star , where the star and its neighbour were required to originate from different fields .",
    "a total of 6556 matches were found in the overlapping @xmath0 images in the magnitude range @xmath59 , while the algorithm yielded 3779 matches in the @xmath1 magnitude range @xmath60 ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 are magnitudes on the standard system ; see the following section ) . figs .",
    "[ coordsv ] and [ coordsi ] show the resulting difference in coordinates between these matched pairs .",
    "the distributions are well fit by a gaussian function ( dotted lines ) , and are centered close to zero , indicating there are no systematic errors affecting the coordinates . also , the standard deviations of the best - fit gaussian distributions give the astrometric error as @xmath61 in ra and @xmath62 in dec .",
    "these errors are not magnitude - dependent in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ranges given above .",
    "stellar magnitudes in all science images were measured using the daophot program @xcite within iraf , which uses an interactive psf - fitting algorithm . the daophot program searches for stars in the image using the psf full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) and standard deviation of the background ( calculated as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the background level in electrons ) as search parameters .",
    "we searched each image for sources with a peak flux greater than @xmath65 above the background level .",
    "if the source was well - fit by an analytic gaussian , the total flux within 25 pixels ( @xmath66 ) was measured to provide an aperture magnitude .",
    "the twenty brightest stars in each image were examined by eye , and those with a ` good looking ' profile ( that is , those stars without bright neighbours or nearby pixel defects ) were median combined to produce an empirical psf model for each ccd image . the psf model radius was 25 pixels .",
    "the psf was then fitted to the profile of each star in the coordinate list using a fitting radius of 6 pixels ( @xmath67 ) or @xmath68 half - width , half - maximum of the psf , dependent on atmospheric seeing . selecting a fitting radius close to the psf hwhm",
    "has a twofold effect : ( i ) the probability of interference from nearby stars is decreased , and ; ( ii ) the effect of background noise on the stellar profile is reduced ( especially in faint stars ) . for images recorded during poor seeing , the daophot search algorithm was found to occasionally identify more than one centre to a star . to remove such double detections , the magnitudes and centres of these ` double stars '",
    "were averaged .",
    "the selection of candidate fornax stars in the outer regions of the object was dependent on an accurate photometric calibration of the entire dataset .",
    "for straightforward observations , a series of standard fields are imaged throughout the observing run , and the instrumental magnitudes of the standard stars are compared to their magnitudes on the standard system .",
    "this results in a solution to the transformation equations , which are then used to shift the observations to the standard system .",
    "however , the fornax survey was a compilation of sixteen fields imaged in two filters throughout four observing runs , and the process of using several sets of standard star measurements to independently calibrate each field would be overly time consuming . also , the detection efficiency is not constant over the wfi array , hence an independent calibration of each ccd was required .",
    "therefore , the photometric calibration was divided into three parts .",
    "first , an internal calibration of the wfi mosaic was conducted , using standard field obervations on each ccd during the december 2003 observing run .",
    "this allowed a comparison of the zero - points of each ccd , shifting the photometry to the same instrumental photometric system .",
    "second , an inter - field calibration was achieved by comparing the instrumental magnitudes measured in the overlap regions between each field .",
    "the zero - points of each field were adjusted to match the field f10 , such that all fields were on the same photometric system . finally , a set of standard fields observed concurrent with f10 in october 2001 were analysed to solve the transformation equations .",
    "thus , the entire fornax dataset was adjusted to the standard magnitude system . a full description of these three procedures is contained below .",
    "all standard fields were chosen from those provided by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when possible , the standard magnitudes used throughout the following analysis came from the canadian astronomy data centre standards web page @xcite .",
    "each ccd in the wfi array displays a significantly different gain ( ranging approximately from 1.4 to 2.0 @xmath69/adu ) , thus the zeropoint calibration in adus is ccd - dependent .",
    "consequently , the first step in the photometric calibration was to measure the photometric difference between the ccds .",
    "the e2 standard field @xcite was imaged on each ccd during the photometric night of 17th december 2003 .",
    "these observations was conducted over a small airmass range to maintain observing conditions for each ccd .",
    "the images were recorded in sets of six , where each set consisted of three @xmath0 and three @xmath1 images with exposure times of 10 , 20 and 30s .",
    "image reduction was achieved following the method described in the reduction section above .",
    "dark sky flat images were obtained by combining long - exposure fornax images from the december 2003 observing run .",
    "a measurement of a stellar magnitude can be accomplished using either a psf - fitting technique or aperture photometry .",
    "although the psf technique is effective for faint stars and/or a crowded stellar field , aperture photometry provides an accurate measure of the total light from a bright , uncrowded source such as a standard star .",
    "therefore , the instrumental magnitudes of all standard stars were measured using aperture photometry .",
    "a series of concentric circles were placed on each standard star and the flux through each aperture was measured using the _ phot _ routine in iraf . the aperture magnitude ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) of the standard star",
    "was then measured as the asymptote of these values .",
    "a total of 336 aperture magitudes were measured for standard stars across the eight wfi ccds from the december 2003 dataset .",
    "these standard star magnitudes were used to provide a solution to the transformation equations , @xmath72 for each ccd .",
    "the zeropoints ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) and the colour terms ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) are ccd - dependent , and are usually calculated using the measured aperture magnitudes ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) and the known standard magnitudes ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "however , the e2 standard stars have a colour range of @xmath79 , which is not large enough to provide an accurate value for the colour terms .",
    "hence , @xmath75 and @xmath76 were assumed to be zero , and the zeropoints ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) of each ccd were determined using the e2 standard star solutions .",
    "an analysis of ccd 2 with a large standard star colour range ( section [ photcal ] ) indicates colour terms of @xmath80 in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , too small to significantly affect the photometry .",
    "hence , we assume colour dependence is negligible over the wfi array .    figs .",
    "[ vstandards_ccd ] and [ istandards_ccd ] display the standard star observations for each ccd . @xmath81 and @xmath82 are defined as the difference between instrumental ( extinction - corrected ) and standard magnitude , @xmath83 therefore , under the assumption that the colour terms @xmath75 and @xmath76 are zero , the mean @xmath81 and @xmath82 values provide an independent measure of the zeropoints for each ccd .",
    "these @xmath73 and @xmath74 values are listed in table [ ccdcalib ] , where the errors are the standard deviation of the mean of the points in figs .",
    "[ vstandards_ccd ] and [ istandards_ccd ] .",
    "table [ ccdcalib ] also includes values for @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the ccd number .",
    "these are calibrating values to convert all wfi magnitudes to a photometric system consistent with ccd 2 . for example , the @xmath86 values in table [ ccdcalib ] indicate that instrumental stellar magnitudes measured in ccd 1 ( @xmath87 mag ) are significantly fainter compared to the remainder of the array in @xmath1 band .",
    "this is the result of lower @xmath1 band quantum efficiency for this ccd .",
    "all subsequent wfi photometry was adjusted by the appropriate @xmath86 value , thus producing constant photometry across each wfi image .",
    "the selection of fornax - candidate stars is dependent on a consistent photometric system across the entire mosiac of fields .",
    "however , variable atmospheric conditions over several observing runs implies a different zeropoint for each field . also , the limited time at the telescope did not allow enough instrumental standard field observations to independently calibrate each field in the survey .",
    "therefore , a robust process was required to adjust the magnitudes in each field such that the survey constituted an internally calibrated dataset .",
    "the previous section described the method to internally calibrate each wfi field such that magnitudes were not ccd - dependent .",
    "this section outlines the process to calibrate all fornax fields to the same photometric system .",
    "@xcite describe the photometric calibration of the millenium galaxy catalogue , a ccd - based imaging survey covering 37.5 deg@xmath2 along the celestial equator .",
    "the internal calibration of the fornax dataset followed the same process .",
    "stellar magnitudes for all fornax fields were measured using the daophot psf - fitting procedure , and those in the @xmath47 overlap region were matched based on astrometry to find multiply detected stars .",
    "the overall zeropoint difference between fields was calculated as the average of these magnitude differences .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ field5calib ] shows the magnitude difference measured between the fields f5 and f6 based on 120 and 133 doubly detected stars in @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the dashed lines represent the measured zeropoint difference between f5 and f6 in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "that is , the overall photometric shift between these fields was found to be , @xmath88 where the errors are the standard deviation of the distributions in fig .",
    "[ field5calib ] .",
    "this process was repeated for all 24 overlap regions .",
    "note that these zeropoint differences were measured after adjusting all magnitudes by the values given in table [ ccdcalib ] to a ccd - independent photometric system .",
    "the magnitude shift for each field was measured by averaging the zeropoint differences obtained for all adjacent fields .",
    "table [ fieldconv ] lists the resulting values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which were added to the zeropoint of each field to adjust them to the f10 photometric system .",
    "table [ fieldconv ] does not include the errors for @xmath89 and @xmath90 due to the difficulty in estimating the propogation of errors across the mosaic of fields . to estimate the internal calibration error the magnitude shifts listed in table [ fieldconv ]",

    "although @xcite found evidence for a break in the profile , it occurred at a larger radius in their data .",
    "this effect may be due to increased contamination from field stars in the irwin & hatzidimitriou survey compared to the current study .",
    "furthermore , the survey of @xcite did not cover a large region outside the fornax system , which may have resulted in an inaccurate estimate of the field star density ; consequently , walcher et al .  may have interpreted the excess of stars at large radii as an indication of a large tidal radius .    although we were able to remove a significant number of the field stars , @xcite possessed photometry at a greater depth than the current survey .",
    "therefore , unless stated otherwise , we use the irwin & hatzidimitriou tidal radius as the nominal value for the remainder of this paper .",
    "we note that the choice of tidal radius has no substantial effect on our final results .",
    "to investigate the possibility of fornax stars beyond the nominal tidal radius , we conducted two independent statistical analyses of the extra - tidal region to search for stellar structure , the results of which are described in the next section .",

    "that is , the density contours were more closely spaced on the eastern side of the major axis than in the west .",
    "the inner structure of a satellite system can be distorted by the gravitational potential of the host galaxy .",
    "simulations of a small stellar system orbiting a larger body ( for example , @xcite ) have found that the structure of the satellite often displays isophotal twisting , such that the ellipticity increases towards the outer regions , and is often accompanied by a changing position angle .",
    "these effects have been observed in the ursa minor dsph @xcite which appears to be experiencing significant perturbation from the galaxy .",
    "consquently , we examined the inner structure of fornax for similar effects .    to reproduce a contour map of fornax , we convolved each fornax rgb star with a gaussian using a radius of @xmath188 .",

    "ellipses were placed at major axis radii @xmath191 arcmin . at each radius , we iteratively measured the best - fitting centre , ellipticity and position angle . fornax has a nominal tidal radius of @xmath192 , though beyond @xmath193 the number density of stars was too small to accurately fit an ellipse .",
    "the results were then placed in @xmath194 radial bins and are shown in fig .",
    "[ lscontour ] .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the central coordinates , ellipticity and position angle of fornax from @xcite , and the errors are the standard deviation of each bin .",

    "[ lscontour](b ) indicates that despite the large difference between our central declination coordinates and those listed for fornax ( @xmath195 ) there appears to be little dependence of this value on radius .",
    "in contrast , the right ascension ( fig .  [ lscontour](a ) ) demonstrates significant radial dependence , such that the centre of fornax moves by @xmath196 west within the inner @xmath197 of fornax .",
    "this confirms the result of @xcite that the eastern contours are more closely spaced than those on the west .",

    "are most likely influenced by the young ms population forming a significant portion of the stars towards the centre of fornax . if we take the values at @xmath200 in fig .",

    "however , beyond this radius the ellipticity decreases with radius : the middle radii of fornax ( @xmath206 ) are quite elliptical ( @xmath207 ) , while inner and outer regions are more circular .",
    "@xcite cites the ellipticity of fornax as @xmath208 , which is consistent with our result at mid - range radii .",
    "the overdensity described in  ",
    "[ results ] and [ outerstr ] bears a striking resemblance to the concentric shells previously discovered in large galaxies @xcite .",
    "numerical modelling by @xcite demonstrated that shell structure is a common remnant of the slow collision between a large galaxy and a lower mass companion .",
    "after the interaction , material from the companion galaxy is distributed in phase - wrapped orbits throughout the large galaxy , and the resulting shells appear as density maxima at the instantaneous turnaround points of the star orbits .",
    "consequently , shells are often observed to be radially interleaved .",
    "for example , the elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 contains a complex shell system thought to have originated from a merging disk galaxy @xmath5@xmath209 yr ago @xcite .",
    "cdm simulations predict that infalling material is often aligned on one or two preferred axes , often forming filamentary structures ( for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these results support the formation of shells through the slow collision between a large galaxy and a smaller companion .",
    "smaller systems are generally bluer than the large elliptical primaries , hence a characteristic of shells is the presence of a bluer population of stars compared to the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "further , the companion often contains a reservior of neutral gas which is shocked during the interaction , thereby producing a new population of stars .",
    "this adds to the blue nature of the resulting shells , which may also retain complexes of hi ( for example , ngc 5128 ; @xcite ) . for the remainder of this section , we discuss alternative scenarios which may have resulted in the observed extra - tidal structure , and present the evidence supporting shell structure in fornax .",
    "if the overdense feature located @xmath116 to the nw of fornax is a shell , then this would support our previous interpretation of the small structure located near the centre of the system @xcite .",
    "however , it is worthwhile investigating other possible origins of the current feature .",
    "an initially plausible explanation is that the feature represents a disrupted globular cluster .",
    "five globular clusters are known to be associated with fornax @xcite , and they are approximately coeval with the formation epoch of the dsph @xcite .",
    "the subtracted cmd we produced for the overdense region ( fig .  [ cmdregsub ] ) does not preclude a star system of this age .",
    "in addition , having subtracted the background stellar population , we measured the absolute integrated magnitude of the observed stars in this feature to be @xmath186 , which falls in the range defined by the other five fornax clusters @xcite .",
    "it thus seems reasonable that this feature may be a sixth fornax cluster , currently suffering a tidal pertubation due to the gravitational influence of its host galaxy .",
    "however , the angular separation of this feature from the centre of fornax is approximately @xmath116 , while the globular clusters are all located within @xmath210 .",
    "@xcite found that the fornax clusters @xmath211 show no evidence for tidal truncation , demonstrating the weak tidal field of fornax .",
    "also , @xcite did not find any sign of structures such as tidal tails in the five fornax clusters .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that a distant cluster would display signs of extreme tidal distortion without a similar effect observed in the other clusters , unless the purported ` sixth cluster ' is contrived to be a very low density system on a highly elliptical orbit with a small pericentric passage .",
    "consequently , the likelihood of this feature being a disrupted globular cluster appears improbable .    a second argument against the disrupted globular cluster explanation is the presence of low surface brightness stellar structures discovered in the nw / se extra - tidal regions of fornax .",
    "both these features and the nw overdensity are abnormal in dsph galaxies , making it far simpler to assume they have a common basis .",
    "a visual examination of the contour plot ( fig .  [ fornaxcontour ] ) supports this view ; these structures display the same orientation as the nw feature ( along the minor axis ) thus implying they stem from the same event .",
    "assuming they have a stellar population similar to the fornax system , we estimate the lobed structures have a mean surface brightness ( after background subtraction ) of @xmath5@xmath212 mag / arcsec@xmath2 , with an absolute integrated magnitude ( to the survey limit ) of @xmath213 .",
    "we note that the structures may continue beyond the current survey limit , thus they may possess a higher luminosity than has been detected in the current survey . however , this value is similar to the integrated magnitudes of the faintest galactic dsphs , such as ursa minor and draco .",
    "another possibility is that these structures may be tidal tails , made up of stars stripped from fornax by the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "stripped stars follow the orbit of the satellite , and can fall back into this system at later times when the gravitational influence of the large host galaxy is reduced .",
    "the fornax structures appear similar to the tails formed in numerical models of a disrupting satellite orbiting a large host galaxy @xcite .",
    "these simulations also predict that the tidal tails may be clumpy , as matter is preferentially stripped from the satellite at perigalacticon .",
    "observations of disrupting satellites , such as palomar 5 @xcite and the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) support these predictions .",
    "hence , the nw feature may represent a clump in the tidal tail of fornax .",
    "however , clear tidal tails have only been observed in a single dsph satellite of the galaxy ; the sagittarius dsph .",
    "the sagittarius orbit brings it within approximately 15 kpc from the galactic centre with an orbital eccentricity of @xmath214 @xcite , thus experiencing substantial tidal forces .",
    "in contrast , fornax is located at a distance of 140 kpc @xcite , and proper motion measurements indicate it is on a polar orbit with a small eccentricity ( @xmath215 ) , and is currently at perigalacticon @xcite . also , @xcite measured fornax to be moving towards the ene direction , which does not support tidal extensions to the nw / se quadrants .",
    "moreover , fornax contains a mass larger than all the other galactic dsphs combined ( excluding sagittarius ) , which further precludes the possibility of stars escaping from this relatively deep potential well .",
    "the ursa minor dsph also displays signs of interaction with the galaxy ; its internal structure is clearly disturbed @xcite and umi has a significant population of stars beyond the tidal radius @xcite .",
    "however , this object lies at a galactocentric distance less than half that of fornax , and its total mass is approximately one third that of fornax .",
    "that is , umi experiences stronger tidal forces than fornax , and is less able to resist the consequential mass loss .",
    "therefore , we do not expect to see a more prominent effect of galaxy - satellite interaction in fornax compared to umi .",
    "thus , given the relatively large mass , distance and orbital parameters of fornax , the likelihood of it forming extra - tidal structures due to the galactic tidal field is low .",
    "based on data from the deep fornax survey by stetson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we presented an analysis of an overdensity of stars located approximately @xmath30 from the centre of fornax , or just outside the core radius @xcite .",
    "the overdense region of stars was shell - like in appearance , and after performing a similar cmd subtraction technique as described in  [ nwshell ] , we found it to be dominated by stars with an age @xmath52 gyr .",
    "our inference was that this feature represented shell structure in fornax , the remnant of a collision between the dsph and a gas - rich companion approximately 2 gyr ago .",
    "however , this conclusion was based on a single shell with an absolute integrated magnitude of @xmath216 . here",
    "we have shown the presence of another shell - like feature , @xmath4 , located on the opposite side of fornax at an angular separation of @xmath217 from the centre of the dsph .",
    "the two shells are concentric ; they are aligned with the major axis of fornax and are situated on the minor axis . from these results , and",
    "the arguments presented above , we propose that this nw feature is a second shell , supporting the hypothesis of shell structure in a dsph . in this case , the two lobes of material in the nw / se extra - tidal regions represent those stars which are not at the extremes of their radial orbits .",
    "this effect is seen in large galaxies containing a shell system ; the region inside the shells display a small increase in surface brightness compared to the background @xcite .",
    "although we do not have deep enough photometry here to accurately investigate the stellar populations of these features , a supporting result for shell structure would be a prominent young stellar population similar that seen in the inner fornax shell @xcite .    if a gas - rich companion merged with fornax , then this encounter should have affected the star formation and chemical enrichment histories .",
    "fornax is known to have experienced a complex star formation history .",
    "the deep photometric studies by stetson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and saviane et al .",
    "( 2000 ) revealed that this system contains a young main sequence incorporating stars possibly as young as @xmath218 yrs , which is unusual compared to the other dwarf spheroidals associated with the galaxy .",
    "indeed , @xcite examined the chemical enrichment history of fornax using infrared spectra of 117 stars located towards the centre , and they note that the `` metallicity distribution and amr [ age - metallicity relation ] that we derive for fornax make it a complex system , more reminiscent of the lmc or the milky way s disk than of the other dsphs . ''",
    "perhaps the most pertinent point relating to our encounter hypothesis was found by @xcite , who were able to reproduce the qualitative appearance of the fornax cmd using their amr .",
    "they noted that fornax contains a tail of relatively metal rich red giants , with an approximate abundance range of @xmath219 [ fe / h ] @xmath220 , and that these stars have an age of @xmath52 gyr .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that fornax experienced a substantial metallicity increase in the last few gigayears , and that the star formation rate increased by a factor of @xmath52 in the last @xmath11 gyr .",
    "although this result contains uncertainties depending on stellar evolution models , it is highly relevant to our claim of a merger between fornax and a gas - rich companion @xmath52 gyr ago .",
    "the ensuing gas shocking mechanisms would have resulted in a significantly accelerated star formation .",
    "shells are formed during the slow collision between a galaxy and a small counterpart , and this process is dependent on having a relatively fixed potential and a dynamically cold intruder . as such",
    ", we do not expect the overall structure of fornax to have been adversely affected by this event , and this is supported by our analysis of the inner regions of fornax ; apart from a slight radial dependence of isophote centre , position angle and ellipticity , there are no signs of significant perturbation .",
    "the radial profile we derived for fornax indicated an excess of stars compared to the king model at large radii , which is often interpreted as representing extra - tidal structure .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite performed simulations describing the build of dark halos through merging satellites .",
    "they predict that an infalling satellite with a `` puffy '' structure may cause baryonic feedback effects in the central regions of the host system , causing in an expanding halo centre and initiating a burst of star formation .",
    "the resulting radial profile resembled a power law distribution with a flat core , qualitively similar to the profile we derived for the fornax rgb stars .",
    "stetson et al .  ( 1998 ) note that the most recent burst of star formation appears to have been concentrated at the centre of fornax and the young main sequence stars define a bar ( @xmath520 arcmin in length ) possibly with two lobes at either end ( see their fig .",
    "this distribution bears a remarkable similarity to the ` bow - tie ' structures produced in the shell formation models of @xcite .",
    "the concentric nature of the two fornax shells , and their location on opposite sides of fornax , support a low angular momentum ( radial ) encounter . on the other hand , the young ms bar found by stetson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is not aligned with these shells , which , on the basis of the hernquist & quinn models , would suggest a high angular momentum ( non - radial ) encounter .",
    "however , a high angular momentum encounter is often characterised by chaotic streams which we have not detected in fornax , and thus this particular encounter may fall somewhere between the two scenarios .",
    "modelling of the interaction is required to shed further light on the merger process .",
    "large galaxies have been observed to contain up to 20 shells @xcite which are interleaved with radius .",
    "consequently , fornax may contain a larger number of shells than has been observed here , and these may also be radially interleaved .",
    "shells occur at the turnaround points of the stellar radial orbits , and hence those at larger radii contain stars with longer orbital periods , thus implying a longer formation time than those at small radii . that is , the formation of shells propagates outwards with time . as such ,",
    "a deeper wide - field study of fornax may reveal more shells closer to and further from the galaxy centre than the nw feature . also , stars occupying the shell are turning around in their orbits , and hence the motion of these stars ( relative to the host galaxy ) will be close to zero @xcite .",
    "consequently , shells are expected to be kinematically cold , and the radial velocity dispersion of the fornax shells may further reveal the nature of this interaction .",
    "dwarf galaxies are dominated by dark matter , hence numerical simulations ( with a complete model of baryonic and dark matter ) are required to confirm if the slow collision of two dwarf galaxies can produce the structure observed in fornax .",
    "we note though that the extra - tidal structures appear remarkably similar to the models of interacting dark halos presented by @xcite .",
    "accurate photometry in two colours ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) was obtained for a 10 deg@xmath2 region centred on the fornax dsph galaxy with the aim of searching for extra - tidal structure .",
    "we have complete photometry down to a magnitude of @xmath3 , which corresponds to stars approximately 1 mag brighter than the fornax red clump .",
    "stars were selected using the cmd of fornax as a mask , thereby increasing the contrast of fornax red giants compared to the field star population .",
    "the radial profile revealed a significant excess of stars compared to the best - fitting king profile beyond a major axis radius of @xmath5@xmath221 , a strong indication of extra - tidal structure .",
    "the distribution of candidate rgb stars revealed a high - density feature located @xmath222 deg nw from the centre of fornax , or approximately 30 arcmin beyond the nominal tidal radius .",
    "the feature has a similar appearance to the shells discovered in e galaxies @xcite , and is located on the opposite side of fornax to the original shell postulated by @xcite .",
    "we removed the background stellar population , and calculated the absolute integrated magnitude from all observed stars in the nw feature to be @xmath223 . after including the unseen light from stars below the survey limit ( @xmath5@xmath155 of the total ,",
    "depending on the imf and age of the stellar population ) then we estimate the total light from the nw feature to be @xmath4 .",
    "a full statistical analysis of the density of candidate red giants in the extra - tidal region revealed two ` lobes ' to either side of fornax , located in the nw and se quadrants .",
    "these lobes are situated along the minor axis , symmetric about the fornax major axis , and share the alignment of the two shells mentioned above . after removing the background population ( and assuming these features have approximately the same luminosity function as fornax ) we measured their mean visual surface brightness to be @xmath224 mag / arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "thus , to the spatial limit of our survey , they display an integrated absolute magnitude of @xmath213 , approximately equal to that of the faintest galactic dsph systems in ursa minor and draco @xcite .",
    "we propose these structures and the new nw shell are the remnant of an merged companion galaxy , the same event we claim to have caused the inner shell @xcite .",
    "in addition to the original fornax shell , these structures present strong evidence for an interaction with a smaller companion in the relatively recent past .",
    "cdm simulations predict that the accretion process is scale - free , hence dwarf galaxies are predicted to have formed through the merger of several smaller systems .",
    "although recent infall is not expected to have occurred in dwarf galaxies , our observations provide evidence for a recent accretion into the fornax system .",
    "albeit at a smaller scale , this scenario is analogous to the merger event occurring between the sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the milky way .",
    "deep photometric ( and spectroscopic ) data are required to explore the nature of these fornax structures .",
    "if the stellar population is similar to the fornax system , this would indicate the substructures are tidal tails . however , if the stars in the shell display a marked difference from those in fornax ( such as a blue , kinematically cold population ) , this would support the possibility of shell structure in a dsph .",

    "<S> the results of a photometric survey of the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy are presented herein . </S>",
    "<S> accurate photometry in two colours ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) was collected over a 10 deg@xmath2 area centred on the fornax system with the aim of searching for extra - tidal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the data were complete to a magnitude of @xmath3 , or approximately one magnitude brighter than the fornax red clump stars . </S>",
    "<S> stars were selected with a colour and magnitude lying near the fornax red giant branch , thereby reducing contamination from the field star population . </S>",
    "<S> we were thus able to probe the outer structure of this dwarf galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> immediately visible was a shell - like structure located 1.3 degrees nw from the centre of fornax , approximately 30 arcmin beyond the nominal tidal radius at this position angle . </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the absolute visual magnitude of this feature to be @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the feature is aligned with a previously reported shell ( age @xmath5 2 gyr ) located near the core radius of fornax . </S>",
    "<S> a statistical analysis of the extra - tidal stellar distribution further revealed two lobes situated on the fornax minor axis which are aligned with the two shell - like features . </S>",
    "<S> the two - lobed structure combined with the two shells provide strong evidence that fornax has experienced a merger event in the relatively recent past . </S>"
