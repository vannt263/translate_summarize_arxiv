    "the linear optical polarization @xmath2 of photo - luminescence ( pl ) in quantum wells ( qws ) are very sensitive to low symmetry interactions @xmath3 , which can be responsible for this polarization ( refs @xcite ) .",
    "a typical situation corresponds to relatively weak @xmath3 , which mixes the light hole ( lh ) and heavy hole ( hh ) states . by this virtue the polarization reaches the magnitude about @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is hh - lh energy splitting ) without external magnetic field ( refs@xcite ) .",
    "strong polarization of luminescence from [ 001 ] - oriented quantum wells cd@xmath6mn@xmath7te /cdte/ cd@xmath8mn@xmath7te and its @xmath9-periodic anisotropy ( i.e. dependence on sample rotation about qw normal ) has been observed in refs @xcite under in - plane magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "there was assumed that these properties are due to @xmath11 symmetry potential of a hole in qw .",
    "it was found that polarization and its anisotropy increases sharply with increasing of in - plane magnetic field and reaches few tens percents .",
    "this fact can not be consistent with small value of ratio @xmath12 . moreover , strong polarization effects as well as the significant contribution of fourth harmonic of aforementioned anisotropy for narrow qws remains so far unexplained@xcite . the phenomenological approach developed in ref@xcite in terms of bilinear in @xmath13 representation of @xmath2 can not describe the strong effects when @xmath14 .    the complementary approach of ref.@xcite in terms of pseudospin formalism requires the proper determination of pseudospin basic functions both for real electron spin operators and for non - spin part of interaction being responsible for optical transitions .",
    "moreover different kinds of hh interactions , which determine the hh splitting under in - plane magnetic field need further consideration .",
    "this means that for correct description of above experimental data it is necessary to have a microscopic theory in terms of actual electron and hole spins rather then pseudospins .    here , we pay attention to the well - known fact that any interaction splitting the degenerate electron and hh levels imposes some phase correlations between the electron and hole wave functions .",
    "in addition to above small contribution caused by lh - hh mixing , this correlation forms the polarization and its anisotropy associated with some pair of distinguishable electron - hole optical transitions regardless of spin levels splitting value .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are different possible interactions which are able to lift the hh degeneracy in a magnetic field ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "latter interactions impose their specific correlations between electron and hole @xmath0 - function phases as well as the period and phase of optical polarization anisotropy ( opa ) , i.e. polarization dependence on qw rotation about its normal .",
    "thus , if one of the four possible electron - hh transitions prevails ( for instance , due to low enough temperatures ) , one can expect the appearance of strong optical polarization .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a quantitative microscopic analysis of optical polarization anisotropy caused by different low - symmetry interactions of a hole in qw .",
    "first , we discuss the general expression for opa in terms of electron and hh @xmath0- functions phases .",
    "then we show that the different interactions leading to hh splitting reveal the various opa dependencies on in - plane magnetic field @xmath13 rotation .",

    "we discuss the effects of spectral shifts of electron - hh optical transitions caused by spin splitting ( [ f2])_. _ a simplest situation corresponds to the electron - hh optical line splitting into the four plainly distinguishable components with polarizations @xmath101 and intensities @xmath102 .",
    "if these components overlap with each other ( i.e. splitting of spectral components are smaller than their linewidth @xmath103 ) , the polarization depends on spectral position at the contour of a composite line of optical transitions .",

    "the profile of this potential ( and therefore the hole density ) is not symmetric in qw plane . in - plane asymmetry of localized hole @xmath203-function leads to mixing of hh @xmath204 and lh @xmath205 states that results in appearance of a finite hh @xmath90-factor ( ref.@xcite ) .",
