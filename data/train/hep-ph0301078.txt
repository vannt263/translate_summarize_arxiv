    "despite standard model ( sm ) describes successfully all low energy experiments , it is an incomplete theory .",
    "this theory contains many unsolved and fundamental problems , such as the origin of cp violation , mass spectrum and the number of generations .",
    "recent observation of neutrino oscillations @xcite indicated that neutrino sector of sm must be enlarged .",
    "one of the most straightforward and economical extension of the sm is adding the fourth generation to the fermionic sector , similar to the three  generation case .",
    "the extra generation can contribute to the electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "latest studies in the electroweak sector allow the existence of a fourth generation with heavy dirac neutrino @xcite .",
    "moreover , two or three extra generations with relatively `` light '' neutrinos , with a mass about @xmath7 are also allowed @xcite .",
    "changing neutral current ( fcnc ) transitions provide potentially the most sensitive and stringiest test for the sm at loop level , since they are forbidden in the sm at tree level . at the same time",
    "these transitions are very sensitive to the new physics beyond the sm via contributions of the new particles to the loop diagrams .",
    "it should be stressed that if newly proposed particles are heavy and if they can not be produced directly in the accelerators , their influence through the loop diagrams can be a unique possibility for establishing new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the effects of the fourth generation to rare decays have been studied in many works @xcite@xcite .",
    "although theoretically fcnc processes are highly suppressed in the sm , very exciting results are obtained on the experimental side .",
    "the first measurement of the fcnc processes through @xmath8 were reported by cleo @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath9 decay is observed at b factories at slac and kek @xcite@xcite .",
    "babar collaboration also reported their preliminary results about the observation of @xmath10 decay with branching ratio @xmath11 and @xmath12 c.l .",
    "@xmath13 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the contributions of the fourth generation to the processes induced by the @xmath1 transitions and use the experimental results of the branching ratio for the @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays and try to determine the constraints on the extended cabibbo  kobayashi",
    " maskawa matrix ( ckm ) elements @xmath4 and @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the basic theoretical expressions for the differential widths of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays , and for the mass difference @xmath15 , with sequential up  like quark in the fourth generation model .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis and the conclusion .",
    "in this section we present the necessary theoretical formulae for the @xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 decays and for the mass difference in the @xmath2 system in presence of the fourth generation .",
    "all these processes , except mixing in the @xmath2 system , are induced by the @xmath1 transition . at quark level",
    "this transition is described by the effective hamiltonian [ e1 ] h_eff = v_tb v_ts^_i=1 ^ 10 c_i ( ) o_i ( )  , where the full set of operators in @xmath16 and the corresponding expressions for the wilson coefficients in the sm3 ( here and in all further discussions sm3 and sm4 will denote sm with three and four generations , respectively ) are given in @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the fourth generation introduces the first three generations into sm copiously , and hence it is clear that it changes only values of the wilson coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 with the help of the running fourth generation up quark @xmath6 at loop level , and do not introduce any new operator structure , i.e. , [ e2 ] c_7^tot ( ) & = & c_7^sm ( ) + c_7^t^ ( )  , + c_9^tot ( ) & = & c_9^sm ( ) + c_9^t^ ( )  , + c_10^tot ( ) & = & c_10^sm ( ) + c_10^t^ ( )  , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the elements of the @xmath22 cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "the explicit forms of the @xmath23 can easily be obtained from the sm results by simply substituting @xmath24 . neglecting the @xmath25 quark mass",
    ", the effective hamiltonian leads to the following matrix element for the @xmath26 transition [ e3 ] m & = & v_tbv_ts^  , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the four  momenta of the final leptons .",
