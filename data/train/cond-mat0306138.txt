    "<S> the technique of damage spreading is used to study the phase diagram of the easy axis anisotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet on two geometrically frustrated lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the triangular and kagome systems are built up from triangular units that either share edges or corners respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the triangular lattice undergoes two sequential kosterlitz - thouless transitions while the kagome lattice undergoes a glassy transition . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the phase boundaries obtained using damage spreading are in good agreement with those obtained from equilibrium monte carlo simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> frustrated antiferromagnets are particularly interesting because they allow novel kinds of low - temperature magnetic states to develop @xcite which are quite different from those observed in conventional magnets @xcite . when the frustration is due entirely to the geometry of the lattice </S>",
    "<S> , exact results for the @xmath0 ising model on the triangular @xcite and kagome @xcite lattices have shown that there is no long range order at any temperature and the system has a macroscopic ground state degeneracy . in the triangular case , the spin - spin correlation function decays with a power law @xcite whereas , in the kagome geometry , it decays exponentially at zero temperature @xcite . for isotropic vector spin models ( xy or heisenberg ) on a triangular lattice @xcite where the elementary triangles share edges , the frustration is partially relieved and a noncollinear planar ground state forms with neighbouring spins making angles of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> finite temperature transitions are evident in both cases ( xy and heisenberg ) but are topological in nature . however , for the kagome lattice , the cornering sharing geometry leads to a disordered ground state for the heisenberg model with the phenomenon of order by disorder occuring in the limit @xmath2 with fluctuations favouring coplanar spin configurations @xcite    in order to explore the heisenberg model on these geometrically frustrated lattices , various types of perturbations have been applied and have shown a strong effect on the ground state manifold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the following anisotropic hamiltonian    @xmath3    where @xmath4 represents a classical three component spin of unit magnitude located at each site @xmath5 of a ( triangular / kagome ) lattice and the exchange interactions are restricted to nearest - neighbour pairs of sites . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath6 describes the strength of the exchange anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our attention to the case where @xmath7 represents an easy - axis anisotropy and we measure temperature and energy in units of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the limit @xmath9 corresponds to the isotropic heisenberg model whereas the limit @xmath10 corresponds to an infinite spin ising model .    </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo studies have shown for the triangular lattice the existence of two distinct kt types of defect - mediated phase transitions at finite temperature @xcite for @xmath7 . by examining the limit @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , the transition at the heisenberg point also appears to be purely topological in character @xcite but with exponentially decaying spin correlations in the low temperature phase . </S>",
    "<S> studies of the same model on the kagome lattice @xcite indicate the existence of a finite , but very low , temperature ferromagnetic transition for intermediate values of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> static results for the magnetization , susceptibility and specific heat indicate an ising - like transition but with a nonuniversal critical behaviour @xcite in which the values of the exponents vary with the strength of the anisotropy @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the individual spins do not exhibit any long ranged spatial order and resemble a glassy phase . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the time evolution of the double time spin auto - correlation function following a quench of the system from infinite temperature into a non - equilibrium state at low temperature displays the phenomenon of aging which is a characteristic of many glassy systems . </S>",
    "<S> additional evidence for the glassy nature of this low temperature state has also recently been found in a study of relationship of the spin autocorrelation function to the response of the system to an external magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem is observed with properties similar to both structural glasses and spin glasses .         versus temperature for the triangular lattice with @xmath11 and two differents values of the anisotropy ( a ) @xmath12 and ( b ) @xmath13 for different initial damage : @xmath14(plus ) and @xmath15(crosses ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insets show the average distance associated with the transverse components.,title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=347 ]   versus temperature for the triangular lattice with @xmath11 and two differents values of the anisotropy ( a ) @xmath12 and ( b ) @xmath13 for different initial damage : @xmath14(plus ) and @xmath15(crosses ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insets show the average distance associated with the transverse components.,title=\"fig:\",width=453,height=347 ]    in the present work we present a numerical study of the model described by hamiltonian ( 1 ) for both lattices using a damage spreading algorithm . in the damage spreading method @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the damage distance between two different initial spin configurations is measured as they evolve with the same thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between two configurations is defined in the following way : if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the spins of the two different replicas , then the distance between them at time @xmath18 is defined as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the total number of spins and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure of the spreading of damage is as follows : for a given value of the anisotropy @xmath6 and temperature @xmath22 we first initialize the system @xmath16 in a random configuration and then let it evolve to a steady state . then we make two additional copies of the system , @xmath17 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce damage in both systems @xmath24 and @xmath25 by inverting a fraction of the spins . </S>",
    "<S> the two copies @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to cases where ( 1 ) a randomly chosen spin is flipped with @xmath26 and ( 2 ) all the spins are flipped with @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> given these different initial conditions we let all the configurations evolve in time according to the same dynamics , i.e , the same rule and the same random number sequence in the monte carlo procedure . after a relaxation time needed for the damaged copies to be thermalized , we monitor the damage in order to calculate the time average @xmath28 of the distance ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is repeated for many different samples ( initial configurations @xmath6 and damaged configurations @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . at high temperatures , the averages @xmath29 and @xmath30 are equal but at low temperatures they approach different values . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this result as indicating that the free energy landscape has a single valley at high temperature and that a transition to a more complicated multi - valley landscape occurs as the temperature is lowered .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the geometry of the two lattices for different sizes @xmath31 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the number of sites @xmath32 and periodic boundary conditions are applied . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations have been performed for sizes ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , but all of the results are presented with @xmath11 where finite size effects are sufficiently small and a larger number of monte carlo sweeps ( mcs ) are possible . </S>",
    "<S> for each temperature we calculate the time average of the damage using 10000 mcs and typically 200 samples were used to compute the averages .    in the case of the triangular lattice , recent monte carlo simulations </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have shown the existence of two finite temperature kt transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the upper transition @xmath35 corresponds to the onset of power law correlations for the spin components parallel to the easy axis @xmath7 and the lower transition @xmath36 corresponds to the onset of power law correlations for the perpendicular components . in both cases there </S>",
    "<S> is a corresponding spin stiffness coefficient which vanishes . in order to identify both transitions </S>",
    "<S> , we also compute the following measure of the damage distance associated with the transverse ( xy ) components of the spins in the two replicas    @xmath37    as shown in figure 2(a ) for the isotropic heisenberg case @xmath38 both distances are independent of the initial damage at high temperature but become dependent on it below the same temperature @xmath39 which agrees quite well with previous estimates of the transition temperature using equilibrium methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for values of @xmath7 , three different temperature regions are observed as shown in figure 2(b ) for the case @xmath13 : ( i ) @xmath40 , both distances depend on the initial damage , ( ii ) @xmath41 , @xmath42 is independent of the initial damage whereas @xmath43 still depends on the initial damage and ( iii ) @xmath44 , both distances become independent on the initial damage . </S>",
    "<S> the damage spreading approach is able to identify both transitions which , in this case , correspond to defect unbinding transitions and it also predicts a finite temperature transition in the heisenberg limit .        our results for the kagome lattice are shown in figure 3 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> there are only two phases : a low temperature phase @xmath45 where the value of @xmath43 is dependent on the initial value of @xmath46 and a high temperature phase @xmath47 where @xmath43 is independent of the initial damage . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse distance @xmath48 does not indicate any transition at all . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath49 depends on the value of the anisotropy @xmath6 and approaches zero in both the @xmath9 and @xmath50 limits . in figure 4 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the phase diagrams obtained using this damage spreading approach for both lattices . </S>",
    "<S> both phase diagrams are in remarkably good agreement with those obtained from equilibrium studies @xcite within errorbars .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the technique of damage spreading can be applied successfully to models where analytical solutions are lacking and where the low temperature phase displays novel behaviour associated with geometrical frustration . </S>",
    "<S> we can clearly identify the damage transitions with those obtained previously using conventional monte carlo simulations . both defect - mediated and glass - like transitions are detected by the method . </S>",
    "<S> further work is needed to extract more detailed information about the critical properties using this approach . + * acknowledgments *    the authors would like to acknowledge support from the natural sciences and research council of canada and the high performance computing facility at the university of manitoba . </S>"
