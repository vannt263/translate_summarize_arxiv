    "these issues include cosmic censorship , the hoop conjecture , the penrose inequality , and critical phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the other , more practical one , is to study the dynamics of astrophysically compact objects . to meet the needs of existing ( e.g. , ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo600 @xcite , and tama @xcite ) and planned ( e.g. lisa @xcite ) gravitational wave detectors ,",
    "the theoretical prediction of the gravitational waveform for realistic sources has become urgent . in both of the aspects of numerical relativity ,",
    "the most important targets for study are black holes and neutron stars , especially those in binary systems .",
    "after decades of exploration by many researchers , recently there have been exciting breakthroughs in the simulation of the evolution of binary black holes ( bbhs ) @xcite .",
    "soon after these breakthroughs , the moving puncture method based on the bssn formalism @xcite was widely used by numerical relativity groups to deal with black hole systems @xcite and neutron star systems @xcite . much interesting physics related to bbhs",
    "has been explored , including the waveform of the gravitational radiation @xcite , the spin - orbit coupling effect @xcite , and the recoil velocity @xcite .",
    "it has been emphasized in almost all of these studies that the treatment of the singularity problem , i.e. , the moving puncture method and the gauge condition , are both key factors in this series of successes . not needing any inner boundary condition",
    "makes the moving puncture method much simpler to handle , compared with the excision method @xcite .",
    "this simplicity has made the moving puncture method popular in the numerical relativity community .",
    "the bona - masso type slicing gauge conditions @xcite for the lapse function and many driver gauge conditions ( e.g. , the @xmath0-driver ) for the shift vector @xcite have been shown to be very important in making the moving puncture method work . however , in @xcite it was shown that , although the details of the gauge conditions used in the punctured bbh evolutions are different , only certain gauge choices allow one to evolve a single moving puncture black hole .",
    "it is desirable to better understand the effect of the gauge choices on black hole evolutions .    in order to study numerical relativity and",
    "also investigate the specific aforementioned topics we develop , from scratch , a code based on the moving puncture method .",
    "we adopt a fourth - order finite differencing scheme for the spatial derivatives and the crank - nicholson scheme for the time integrations .",
    "we use the grace package @xcite to implement both the mesh refinement and the parallelization in our code . in this paper",
    "we present our primary results about the evolution of a single static black hole , of a single moving black hole , of the head - on collision of a bbh , and of the head - on collision perturbed by a scalar field .",
    "our results confirm many results obtained in the previous works by other groups . on the other hand",
    "we find a new gauge condition , which has not been tried by other researchers , that can also give stable and accurate black hole evolution calculations .",
    "we also observe the effects of the existence of a massless scalar field in delaying the head - on collision , depending on the initial configuration of the scalar field .",
    "all of these results enhance our confidence in this code , and thus we will apply the code to more realistic astrophysical calculations in the near future .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ secii ] , we first summarize the bssn formulation , the conventional modifications and adjustments , and the gauge conditions .",

    "the initial data is outlined . in section [ secv ] , we present our numerical results on the evolutions of a single static black hole , of a single moving black hole with and without spin , and of the head - on collision of a bbh , with and without a massless scalar field . we summarize and discuss the implications of our findings in sec .",

    "we apply the standard centered finite differencing approximation to all spatial derivatives except the advection terms ( i.e. , the terms of the form @xmath62 ) . for these advection terms",

    "the computational domain is represented by a hierarchy of nested cartesian grids ; we adopt the cell - centered scheme , and the grid hierarchy follows the berger and oliger algorithm @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy consists of @xmath73 levels of refinement indexed by @xmath74 , ... ,",

    "a refinement level consists of one or more cartesian grids with constant grid spacing @xmath77 on level @xmath78 .",
    "all grid blocks have the same logical structure , and refinements are bisected in each coordinate direction .",
    "a refinement factor of @xmath79 is used such that @xmath80 .",

    "this understanding leads us to try combinations of these three cases .",
    "panel vi shows that the combination of the @xmath96 and the @xmath98 advection term additions , i.e. , @xmath103 , results in a profile with high frequency noise for @xmath102 around the black hole and makes an even stronger instability .",

    "panel ix shows that all the variables behave very well and smoothly .",
    "the curve profiles in panels ii , vii , and ix look almost the same .",
    "the linearized analysis of the bssn formulation with the gauge conditions in @xcite shows that both gauges ii and vii have zero - speed modes .",
    "however , from the results described in this section , we can not distinguish the difference between gauges ii , vii and ix . furthermore , fig .  5 of @xcite , which corresponds to gauge ii , shows no zero - speed modes at all .",
    "we conjecture that the nonlinearity of the full theory could eliminate the zero - speed modes for gauges ii and vii in general .",
    "in fact , gauge ii @xcite , as well as gauge ix @xcite , has been successfully used in the simulations of black hole evolution .",
    "and gauge vii is as good as gauges ii and ix for black hole simulations , at least in the cases tested in this work .",

    "someone may raise the doubt that the moving velocity is not large enough to excite the zero speed mode for the newly found gauge condition here .",

    "our results will show that gauge vii , as well as gauges ii and ix , passes these two tests .          in this subsection , we investigate the effect of spin on a moving black hole .",
    "firstly , we set the spin direction of the black hole to be parallel to its moving direction , specifically , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the only difference between the setting here and in the previous subsection is that , in this subsection , the black hole has a spin of amplitude @xmath113 which is along the moving direction .",
    "here we only test the `` good '' gauge choices , i.e. , gauges ii , vii and ix .",
    "the curve profiles at @xmath93 are presented in the upper panels of fig .",
    "we find that , with any of these three gauges , the code can stably simulate a spinning black hole .",
    "the curves in the three upper panels look the same , not showing a sign of instability . compared with fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we find that the black holes in this case move slower ( @xmath114 ) than the spinless ones ( @xmath115 ) with the same gauge choices described in the previous subsection .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical prediction : from eq .",
    "( [ admmass ] ) we can see that the moving black hole with a nonvanishing spin will have a larger adm mass than the spinless one due to the rotational energy . for the moving velocity being @xmath106",

    "our conclusion in this test is that gauges ii , vii and ix all handle this scenario well , since these three gauges give almost the same result .",
    "secondly , we set the spin direction of the black hole to be perpendicular to the moving direction , specifically , @xmath111 and @xmath116 .",
    "similarly , we only test gauges ii , vii and ix .",
    "the curve profiles at @xmath93 are presented in the lower panels of fig .",
    "the results are similar to those obtained in the parallel - spin case . from eq .",
    "( [ admmass ] ) , the moving velocity of the black hole for this case is the same as the velocity in the parallel - spin case , i.e. , @xmath114 .",

    "[ fig2 ] . in this case",
    ", the peak amplitude of the variable @xmath8 becomes smaller than in the parallel - spin case .",
    "however , this difference basically comes from the spin orientation ; it does not bring any instability to the results with the three `` good '' gauges ii , vii and ix .",
    "these three `` good '' gauges give essentially the same stable behavior .",
    "similar to the moving velocity being bounded , the magnitude of the specific angular momentum , @xmath117 , has a maximal value for the approximate initial data ( [ idsoln ] ) . for @xmath118 ,",

    "we find that , with this gauge choice , the code can simulate these dynamical spacetimes well . since experience tells us that a higher spin is more likely to trigger a quicker instability in the numerical simulations , one might doubt whether the newly found gauge condition can handle a high - spin case well . in this subsection",

    "the curves overlap each other well .",
    "the profiles of @xmath102 and @xmath92 are consistent with the experience that they almost give the same shape . due to the limits on computational resources ,",
    "the runs are stopped at @xmath93 .",
    "this might raise the doubt whether the runtime is long enough to excite an unstable mode . since the spin of the black hole in this case is close to the maximal one ( @xmath127 ) that a punctured black hole can have in a bowen - york type initial data @xcite",
    ", we expect that some difference between these runs , caused from instability , will appear in this period of time .",
    "however , we find that the results with these three gauge choices are almost the same",
    ". this should indicate that gauge vii is as good as the other two in this case , unless all three of these gauge choices cause the same instability , which is highly unlikely .",
