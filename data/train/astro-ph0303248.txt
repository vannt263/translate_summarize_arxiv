    "if we define a representative length @xmath30 along a particle world line by @xcite @xmath31 then @xmath30 represents the volume behaviour of the fluid completely .",
    "for example from @xmath30 one can define the hubble function @xmath32 and the deceleration parameter @xmath33 by @xmath34 using definition ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) , equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath35 this shows how the acceleration of the universe ( the curvature of curve @xmath36 ) is directly determined at each point of spacetime .",
    "let us note that @xmath37 acts as a constant repulsive force whereas rotation as a variable repulsive force .    when @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are given as a function of @xmath30 we can integrate equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) . to simplify matter",
    "we take @xmath41 ( because the acceleration vector represents the effects of non - gravitational forces it vanishes when a particle moves along a geodesic , which would necessarily follow in the case of dust ) .",
    "it has been shown that spatially homogeneous , rotating , and expanding universes with the perfect fluid have the non - vanishing shear @xcite .",
    "this is quite contrary to the case of the homogeneous newtonian cosmology where many such solutions are known .",
    "these homogeneous shear - free solutions are independent of the pressure which may be set equal to zero or a constant .",
    "this difference in the two theories seems to be both surprising and interesting since ellis theorem has a purely local character , and it is completely independent of the strength of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "let us consider solutions with @xmath42 , @xmath43 . in this case @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "then we can integrate the raychaudhuri equation using the conservation equation @xmath46 the occurrence of term @xmath22 in the factor @xmath47 is a special relativistic effect @xcite .    in the considered case of @xmath48",
    "we obtain the generalised friedmann equation    [ eq:6 ] @xmath49    where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the scale factor . from the mathematical point of view equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) is a first integral of system ( [ eq:4 ] )",

    "solutions of this equation represent shear - free newtonian cosmologies which are in general both expanding @xmath53 and rotating @xmath54 .",

    "we can then integrate the raychaudhuri equation to obtain the generalised friedmann equation    [ eq:7 ] @xmath60    where @xmath61 is an average scale factor .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to assume that @xmath62 is sufficiently small compared with @xmath63 since the shear falls off more rapidly than the rotation @xcite .    in the case of dust @xmath64 whereas @xmath65 .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum gives @xmath66 @xcite .    from equation ( [ eq:7 ] )",
    "we see that the effect of anisotropy is like in the frw model with stiff matter . in our further analysis of observational effects we consider equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) as a simplest model in which the effect of global rotation can be investigated .",
    "however , we also consider the presence of additional non - interacting radiation matter which can be treated as a simple extension beyond the newtonian model .",
    "the supernovae observations indicate that the universe s expansion has started to accelerate during recent cosmological times , and cmb observations suggest that the universe is dominated by a dark energy component , with negative pressure , driving the acceleration @xcite .",
    "while the most obvious candidate for such a component is the vacuum energy a plausible alternative is the dynamical vacuum energy or quintessence .",
    "however , these models usually face fine - tuning problems , because there is a question of explaining why the vacuum energy dominates the universe only recently @xcite .",

    ".    the form of ( [ eq:12 ] ) can be useful in particle - like description for the simplest model with global rotation , whereas form ( [ eq:11 ] ) is helpful in the analysis of dynamics on a phase plane @xmath83 .",

    "we can see that rotation lowers the value of cosmological constant needed to explain the sn ia data .",
    "the important test to verify whether rotation may represent `` dark energy '' ( which can be called true dark radiation because causes the acceleration of the universe ) is to compare rotation effects with the supernovae type ia data .",
    "the answer is that global rotation may be seriously taken as a candidate to describe only part of dark energy and the cosmological constant is still required .",
    "it is well known that cosmic distance measures , like the luminosity distance , depend sensitively on the spatial geometry ( curvature ) and dynamics .",
