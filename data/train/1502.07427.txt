    "in a recent paper  @xcite we presented a spectral method for tensorial partial differential equations on geometries with a spherical component . we showed how to implement the ` eth'-formalism based on spin - weighted spherical harmonics following the work by newman , penrose and others  @xcite .",
    "the restriction to tensorial equations implied the use of spin - weighted functions with integer spin - weights . in the present work",
    "we extend our method to also include functions with half - integer spin - weight on spherical geometries .",
    "in particular , we show how the evolution of dynamical half - integer spin fields can be accomplished .",
    "our motivation for doing so stems mainly from general relativity : spinorial fields describing elementary particles such as electrons or neutrinos are fundamental sources for the einstein equations and are studied for instance as test fields on kerr - newman backgrounds , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , there are also interesting developments in condensed matter physics in relation to the description of graphene  @xcite for which our method might be relevant .",
    "the numerical treatment of the dirac field is particularly interesting as its evolution can be rather peculiar and sometimes even counter - intuitive as visualised by thaller  @xcite .    it is well known that when working with @xmath1 ( and other compact geometries ) coordinate singularities can lead to instabilities that spoil the accuracy of numerical schemes .",
    "these issues can be avoided by working with spectral methods where coordinate - independent manipulation of expressions in terms of a well - defined basis of functions upon which the action of differential operators reduces to algebraic manipulation is possible @xcite .",
    "thus , issues of coordinate singularities are dealt with automatically by the method .",
    "our spectral method makes use of the spin - weighted spherical harmonics ( swsh ) @xcite which can be shown to be equivalent to the well - known wigner @xmath2-functions @xcite and thus provide a complete , orthonormal basis for @xmath3 . in the description of half - integer spin fields , we have found it convenient to work directly with the half - integer swsh due to the particularly simple action of the associated @xmath4 and @xmath5 differential operators which may be thought of as constituting covariant derivative operators on the sphere @xcite . as the action of the aforementioned operators on the swsh reduces to simple algebraic manipulation we may translate pde systems into coupled ( infinite dimensional ) ode systems and thus construct a spectral evolution scheme for an initial value problem ( ivp ) of interest .",
    "our work extends that of @xcite into a spectral algorithm for spin - weighted spherical harmonics ( swsh ) with half - integer spin - weight @xmath6 .",
    "the method we present inherits several desirable properties from  @xcite .",
    "in particular it is theoretically exact if a minimum number of grid points are used at a given band - limit @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore the same algorithmic complexity of @xmath8 is achievable for spectral transformations . in brief , @xcite seek to calculate values for the integer swsh over @xmath1 by mapping the sphere into the @xmath0-torus ( thus allowing for fast fourier transforms to be used ) and relate the swsh to the reduced wigner @xmath9-functions evaluated at @xmath10 . for a short summary of past work related to the integer case see @xcite .",
    "the approach to the half - integer case is in principle similar , however suitable modification of the @xmath0-torus map must be made in order to account for the periodicity of spinor fields .",
    "in addition , the recursion relation @xcite that allows for evaluation of the wigner @xmath9-functions must be modified .    as a toy model",
    "we numerically explore the dynamics associated with a dirac equation on a 2-dimensional manifold with spatial topology of @xmath1 as an ivp .",
    "this will allow for a test of the spin - weighted spectral transformations we present in the context of evolution equations .",
    "common techniques for treating the numerical problem of the dirac equation consist of : fd schemes formulated on a flat - lattice in configuration space @xcite , on a grid within a finite - volume in momentum - space @xcite and using methods based on the split - step operator technique @xcite .",
    "particular to the fd approach special care must be taken so as to avoid the fermion - doubling problem @xcite .",
    "elimination of spurious modes introduced to the solution may be accomplished by means of nonlocal approximation for the spatial derivative operator @xcite or by staggered - grid schemes @xcite . as remarked upon in @xcite",
    "the issue of spurious modes is not particular to the dirac equation but can occur whenever a symmetric fd approximant is used for a first derivative on a uniform grid .",
    "we seek to avoid the above issue entirely by making use of the global approximation to functions and derivative operators that spectral methods provide @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion ( eom ) that we derive for the dirac equation in the aforementioned geometric setting result in a coupled system of variable - coefficient linear hyperbolic pdes .",
    "when performing a swsh decomposition this results in product terms that must be further simplified . from past experience @xcite",
    "we have found that while it is possible to make use of clebsch - gordan expansions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : swshsum ] ) , i.e. , working entirely in the space of coefficients , it is far more convenient to instead work with a pseudo - spectral method ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : psmethod ] ) , and thus we follow the latter approach in this work .",

    "in this section we briefly summarise key properties of the spin - weighted spherical harmonics ( swsh ) that we will make use of in the presentation of our half - integer spectral algorithm and in the pseudo - spectral method for solution of dynamical systems . for further details",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "geometrically , the spin - weighted functions are sections of certain line bundles over the 2-sphere @xmath1 .",
    "they have a representation in terms of ordinary functions over patches of @xmath1 which depend on the choice of coordinates and the choice of an orthonormal frame at points of the patch .",
    "the behaviour of this representation under changes of the frame is captured by the spin - weight assigned to the function . here",
    ", we will deal only with representations of the spin - weighted functions given in terms of the standard polar coordinates @xmath12 and the orthonormal frame defined in terms of the coordinate derivative vectors @xmath13 equivalently , these vectors can be obtained as real and imaginary parts of the complex linear combination @xmath14 which , together with its complex conjugate , satisfies the orthonormality relations @xmath15 at all points of @xmath1 covered by the polar coordinates with respect to the standard metric on @xmath1 .",
