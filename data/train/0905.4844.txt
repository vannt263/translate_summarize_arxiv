    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in la(o , f)feas  @xcite immediately raised great expectations to advance the theory of high - temperature superconductivity in general , since the crystal structure appeared quite simple and on a first glance displayed similarity to that of the cuprates .",
    "it quickly turned out , however , that there are also striking differences , in particular of the correlated nature of the electron state .",
    "the analysis of many problems in this respect demands real space approaches based on tight - binding ( tb ) models .",
    "an early paper in this direction used a two - orbital tb model.@xcite the need for gradually improving such models was already clearly seen in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , improvements turned out to grow terribly in complexity , and hopping matrix elements up to the fifth neighbor matter.@xcite the situation clearly calls for a detailed analysis of the electronic structure in the tb language as complete as possible . the present paper tries to contribute to this task .    among the new iron based superconducting materials",
    "there are essentially four structural families christened 11 , 111 , 1111 , and 122 according to their stoichiometry in the undoped cases .",
    "fese and fete are representatives of the first family,@xcite lifeas and nafeas represent the second,@xcite    nohyphenation reofepn ,    where re is y , la or a light rare earth element and pn is p , as or sb , belong to the third,@xcite and afe@xmath0as@xmath0 , where a is ca , sr or ba , belong to the last.@xcite all families exhibit a tetragonal structure at room temperature which slightly distorts below the nel temperature of the anti - ferromagnetic order .",
    "the first three families have the non - symmorphic space group p4/nmm in common , while the last family crystallizes in the symmorphic space group i4/mmm .",
    "the unit cells of the first three families as well as the tetragonal cell of the last ( which contains two unit cells ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] .",
    "the generic structural element is a metallic iron chalcogenide / pnictide layer consisting of a square iron atom plane sandwiched between two chalcogen / pnictogen ( c / p ) atom planes in such a way that every fe atom is in the center of a c / p tetrahedron .",
    "the families 11 and 111 consist of neutral metallic layers only , stacked on top of each other in the direction of the tetragonal axis and only weakly bonded in this direction .",
    "thereby lias is isoelectronic with se .",
    "they should easily cleave in planes perpendicular to the tetragonal axis .",
    "in contrast , in the 1111 and 122 families the feas layer is charged and anionic and is intercalated with a non - conducting cationic layer , e.g. lao in the 1111 family and ba in the 122 family .",
    "hence , these materials can not neutrally cleave between intact atom layers .",
    "phenomenologically , superconductivity seems to be quite robust in the ( doped ) families 1111 and 122 , but more sensitive to imperfections in the families 11 and 111 .",
    "this at least goes in line with a remarkable structural difference revealed in table  [ tab:1 ] . for representatives of the four families",
    "this table shows the nearest in - plane fe - fe distance @xmath1 in  , and the ratio @xmath2 of the distance of c / p layers from the fe layer related to the in - plane fe - fe distance .",
    "this latter ratio would be 0.5 in the case of regular c / p tetrahedra . as is evident from table  [ tab:1 ] ,",
    "the cationic interlayers of the 1111 and 122 families put the fe layer under considerable tensile strain , and in line with that the c / p tetrahedra are considerably contracted in the direction of the tetragonal axis .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 is by the way unusually badly reproduced by lattice relaxation within non - magnetic density functional theory ( dft ) , and it seems to be somewhat sensitive to magnetic order . which of the fe @xmath3 bands cross the fermi level and the sequence in energy of these bands depends on the actual value of @xmath2 and often differs for the experimental value and for the dft relaxed value .",
    ".structural parameters of the four families as described in the text .",

    "[ fig:01 ] the essential atomic - shell resolved partial densities of states ( dos ) together with the total dos are shown for the experimental structure parameters of fese ( @xmath4  , @xmath5  , @xmath6).@xcite all band structures in this work are obtained with the high precision full potential local orbital code fplo8@xcite using the perdew - wang 92@xcite version of the local density approximation ( lda ) density functional .",
    "generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) results would somewhat differ in the lattice relaxation by total energy minimization . since",
    ", however , for given fixed structural parameters the results considered here hardly differ at all , and all results presented in this text are for the experimental structures , lda was used throughout",
    ".    for what follows it is relevant that the all electron approach fplo8 uses a carefully optimized ` chemical ' basis ( one basis orbital per atomic core or valence orbital ) plus at most one polarization orbital per band .",
    "the quality of the chemical basis results in occupation numbers of polarization orbitals usually well below 0.02 ( per spin ) , in most cases even much lower ( without loss in accuracy which competes with any of the advanced all - electron full - potential tools presently available . for instance , in a recently published work@xcite results for the 1111 compound laofeas obtained with different band structure methods were compared and very good aggreement between fplo and fplapw results was assessed ) .",
    "this is the reason why projections on the fplo chemical basis orbitals have a lot of chemical relevance , and also produce nearly optimally localized wannier orbitals from band structures in an approach described below in sec .",
    "the situation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] which is generic for all four families considered here can be understood as follows : since there are two fe atoms per unit cell , there is fe - fe homo - covalency . put the structural layers in the @xmath7-plane stacked in @xmath8-direction . for zero wave vector",
    "there are in - plane bonding combinations of fe-@xmath3 orbitals with angular dependence @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , with the same coefficient on both sites and anti - bonding combinations with sign - alternating coefficients . for the angular dependence @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 it is just the other way round , while the orbitals @xmath13 form essentially non - bonding bands . hence , there are four fe - fe bonding bands , four fe - fe anti - bonding bands and two non - bonding bands .",
    "the se-@xmath14 orbitals may couple with the fe - fe anti - bonding combinations only , developing fe - se hetero - covalency with predominantly se-@xmath14 bands below @xmath15  ev and predominantly fe-@xmath3 bands above the fermi level ( the latter put at zero band energy ) .",
    "the fermi level itself falls in a fe - fe covalency pseudo - gap between the bonding plus non - bonding bands of essentially pure fe-@xmath3 character and the anti - bonding bands of hybridized fe-@xmath3-se-@xmath14 character .",
    "this picture prevails in large parts of the brillouin zone ( bz ) and only modifies in the vicinity of the bz - edges parallel to the @xmath8-axis ( through point m of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] below ) .",
    "it results in rather small hole fermi surfaces ( fs ) of fe - fe bonding bands around the @xmath16-axis and in likewise small electron fs around the bz edges parallel to this axis , and hence in the pseudo - gap at the fermi level .",
    "the materials are not far from semi - metals .",
    "there is also fe-@xmath17-se-@xmath14 covalency with a gap of about 7  ev as seen on the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] .",
    "the modifications in the other families compared to 11 are gradual , see figs .  [ fig:02][fig:04 ] .",
    "since the as-@xmath14 states are about 1 ev higher than the se-@xmath14 states , the gap below @xmath18  ev is less pronounced or absent in the arsenides . in lifeas",
    "the pseudo - gap at the fermi level is less pronounced too as the fermi radii are somewhat larger ( larger energy overlap between fe - fe bonding and anti - bonding band groups ) . in laofeas and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 there is also no gap above 2  ev as the la-@xmath19 states and the ba-@xmath20 states , respectively , come down close to the fermi level .",
    "( about 0.4 ba-@xmath20 states are occupied in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 while , when doping with k , the k-@xmath3 states remain empty ; this is why one k atom when replacing ba donates only about 0.6 holes , or 0.3 holes per fe atom , into the fe-@xmath3 bands . )",
    "moreover , the o-@xmath21 states of laofeas appear below @xmath18  ev in addition to the as-@xmath14 states . in the range between @xmath18  ev and the fermi level",
    "there is not so much difference in the bands being almost purely fe-@xmath3 in all cases .",
    "the whole situation with fe-@xmath3-fe-@xmath3 and fe-@xmath3-c / p-@xmath17 covalency is illustrated for the generic example of fese in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] .",
    "the projection of the lda bands on the fplo chemical basis orbitals is given as line thickness in color code .",
    "( the diameter of the color balls in the legend of the figure indicates the thickness for 100 percent orbital content in the band wave function . )",
    "the cyan ( c / p-@xmath22 ) band on the line @xmath23-z which disperses down close to the fermi level has a black component ( fe-@xmath7 ) hidden behind the cyan and amounting to about half of the band state near z. the narrowness below the fermi level of the non - bonding fe-@xmath24 bands is clearly seen .",
    "again seen is that the fe - fe bonding bands below the fermi level do not hybridize with the c / p-@xmath14 orbitals while fe - fe anti - bonding bands strongly hybridize . due to the far extend of the radial orbitals ,",
    "the c / p-@xmath14 states extend even above the fe-@xmath3 bands , over an energy range of more than 10 ev .",
    "it is also seen that the fermi level is crossed by fe @xmath7 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 bands only with a small admixture of c / p @xmath27 orbitals .",
    "right below fermi level fe @xmath28 and @xmath24 admixture sets in , so that one fails to reproduce fermi velocities even qualitatively without consideration of the latter orbitals and their corresponding bands .",
    "remarkable in this respect is also the orbital anisotropy of the fs , again in stark contrast to the case of the cuprates .",
    "while the three fs hole cylinders around @xmath23-z appear more or less orbitally isotropic with one of the outer cylinders and the inner cylinder of @xmath29 character ( of course with their mixing rotating together with @xmath30 ) and the other outer cylinder of @xmath7 character , the outer fs electron cylinder around m in the @xmath31 plane appears totally orbitally anisotropic with @xmath29 character in the directions towards x and nearly pure @xmath7 character in the directions towards @xmath23 .",
    "the inner electron cylinder is again more or less orbitally isotropic with @xmath29 character . in the @xmath32 plane",
    "the inner and outer electron cylinders have interchanged their orbital character .    in all those considerations",
    "the presence of the c / p atoms is essential . without there presence",
    ", the unit cell would reduce to containing one fe atom only , and no interband fe - fe covalency could develop . in fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] the dos of a hypothetical lattice is shown with the se atoms removed from the fese crystal , but the fe atoms left at their positions .",
    "the fe-@xmath3 occupation remains nearly the same ( mullikan analysis with the fplo8 basis results in charge transfer between fe and c / p of less than 0.1 electron charge / atom ) , but no pseudo - gap whatsoever appears as there are now only five fe-@xmath3 bands in the doubled bz .",
    "there is also no covalency band gap of the fe-@xmath17 states any more .",
    "fe - fe covalency appears only due to the doubling of the unit cell caused by the presence of the c / p atoms , due to their additional potential and due to hybridization with c / p-@xmath33 orbitals . also , the width and depth of the pseudo - gap are quite sensitive to the c / p position , that is , to the actual value of the wyckoff parameter @xmath34 .    in a vicinity of half an ev around the fermi level , the band structure in the 1111 family exhibits a pronounced quasi-2d character .",
    "it is somewhat less 2d and in a narrower energy window at the fermi level in the 122 family and much more 3d in the 11 and 111 families .    in the next section",
    "the implications of symmetry on the electronic structure are analyzed in detail .",
    "this provides some key to the construction of reduced tb models . in sec .",
    "iii , a minimum 2d tb model is derived for reasonable quantitative approximations of the low - energy band structures of the fe - c / p layers ( the focus being essentially on excitation energies below 0.1  ev ) , and parameters are given for representatives of all four families .",
    "these are based on a wannier function representation introduced in sec .",
    "the families 11 and 111 exhibit quite sizable 3d dispersion close to the fermi level .",
    "corresponding 3d tb models for these cases are given in sec .",

    "then , ( [ eq:15 ] ) immediately yields @xmath203    the next section deals with the determination of tb parameters from fplo8 band structure results . here , the tb model ( [ eq:09][eq:16 ] ) for the case of fese is analyzed as a typical example .",
    "the corresponding tb parameters are @xmath204 only in a few cases the on - site energies @xmath205 and the hopping matrix elements @xmath206 directly obtained from the wannier approach described in the next section are slightly renormalized in order to grossly account for the neglected hoppings to higher neighbors .",
    "[ fig:09 ] shows the obtained 2d two to five neighbor tb bands in comparison with the full lda bands of the 3d fese crystal . for good reasons the focus of this treatment is on the vicinity of the fermi level . on the first glance it seems not to be an optimal fit there , in particular not around the points m and a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for m , the points z , r , a are at @xmath32 above @xmath23 , x , m ) . however , due to hybridization with the se-@xmath14 states the fe - fe anti - bonding bands have a sizable @xmath16-dispersion which can not be provided by a 2d tb model . the quality on average of neglect of @xmath16-dispersion of this tb model is also seen from the comparison of the dos in fig .  [ fig:10 ] showing that the fit is not unreasonable close to the fermi level .",
    "a further feature of the 2d tb model is the block diagonalization ( [ eq:16 ] ) of the hamiltonian matrix by means of lattice symmetry .",
    "there are two five - band groups in this model which do not interact in the whole bz .",
    "one group comes from symmetric binary wannier states ( [ eq:15 ] ) and one group from alternating ones . from what was said in the introduction",
    "it follows that each of the two groups contains two fe - fe bonding and two fe - fe anti - bonding bands as well as one essentially non - bonding band .",
    "the two groups are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] . within each group",
    "there is no further decoupling in the whole bz . in other words ,",
    "a further reduction of the number of bands of a tb model necessarily demands inclusion of ( many ) higher than second neighbors to mimic the @xmath30-dependent interaction with the omitted bands .    on the side faces of the bz",
    "the two groups are degenerate . as was demonstrated in section  ii",
    ", this degeneracy is a general property of the p4/nmm space group .",
    "it enables to fold out smoothly the ten bands into five bands in a doubled bz ( jones - zone @xcite ) .",
    "one may chose the ss - bands in the bz proper and the aa - bands folded out , or vice versa .",
    "it is now clearly seen that in any case this is not an out - folding of anti - bonding bands against bonding bands .",
    "were it so , a pseudo - gap between bonding and anti - bonding bands could not develop .    the other simplification , the reduction of a @xmath124 hamiltonian matrix to a matrix structure with two @xmath207 blocks @xmath99 ( hermitian ) and @xmath101 ( symmetric ) , is already guaranteed by ( 4 ) which holds for the 122 family too , for which there is no continuous outfolding .",
    "there is no additional benefit besides that .    in summary",
    "so far , without considerably worsening the fit , no less than the 27 tb parameters ( [ eq:17 ] ) will do in reasonably modeling the electronic structure of the iron chalcogenides / pnictides , even if one focusses on the fermi level only .",
    "this is , unfortunately in stark contrast to the situation for the cuprates .    as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig:09 ] , a 2d tb fit for fese can not be very satisfactory for quantitative studies even in an energy window of @xmath208  ev around the fermi level , relevant for low temperature many - body approaches .",
    "this is different for the families 1111 and 122 . in this respect , although their crystal structures are more complex their low - energy electronic structure is simpler and really distinctly 2d .    for laofeas , the 2d tb parameters are obtained as @xmath209 the corresponding low - energy 2d bands are compared with the full 3d lda bands in fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] . since here",
    "the feas layers are separated by lao layers which have no states in the vicinity of the fermi level , the full band structure has a pronounced 2d character there , and consequently the 2d tb approximation is of high quality .",
    "it does not need improvement by considering 3d dispersion . nevertheless , for the lda or gga relaxed structure instead of the here considered experimental wyckoff positions one of the @xmath24-derived bands crosses the fermi level instead of the @xmath7-derived one .",
    "this is why many published band structures show a hole pocket around z instead of the third hole cylinder .    on the expense of an increase of the number of tb parameters to 44 , of course a better overall fit of the 2d band structure in a larger energy window can be obtained.@xcite     +    somewhat surprisingly , the situation for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 in a narrower energy window is similar although not equally perfect .",
    "this allows to treat the low - energy band structure of the 122 family within the same space group p4/nmm ( and bz ) which is the space group for one triple layer of feas , although the space group of the full 3d crystal is i4/mmm ( due to an @xmath39-reflection of adjacently stacked feas triple layers ) . as a convenient consequence",
    ", the hamiltonian ( [ eq:09 ] , [ eq:11 ] ) with its simplifying block structure ( [ eq:13 ] ) applies .",
    "the 2d tb parameters for bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 are obtained as @xmath210 and the low - energy bands together with the full 3d lda bands are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] .",
    "( note , that we used the same path along the bz as for the other cases , although the symmetry of the 122 system differs .",
    "this , however , facilitates comparision . )",
    "+    of course , in both figs .",
    "[ fig:12 ] and [ fig:13 ] the tb bands on lines @xmath23-x - m-@xmath23 and z - r - a - z are identical , but the full 3d lda bands are not and the plot in particular also shows the distinct 2d character of the full bands and the quality of the 2d fit .    for later use",
    "we also give the 2d tb parameters for lifeas valid in connection with the hamiltonian ( [ eq:09 ] , [ eq:11 ] ) although without a 3d generalization provided in sec .",

    "there are basically three goals pursued , when calculating wfs , the first being to obtain functions , which form a suitable basis for the setup of model hamiltonians .",
    "this aim usually implies that the resulting wfs should resemble basis functions , which have a certain chemical characteristic .",
    "the second goal is to reduce the degrees of freedom in the resulting model by projecting out high energy sectors resulting in few - band models .",
    "the last goal is to obtain model hamiltonians with as few as possible parameters , which is essentially the requirement of maximal localization of the wfs .",
    "@xcite introduced a general method of calculating maximally localized wfs . due to the nature of the problem at hand",
    "this approach is rather involved .    in order to fulfill the condition on the chemical characteristics it is in general desirable to pose symmetry restrictions on the wfs . in a local orbital scheme with an optimized chemical basis set",
    "the basis orbitals usually show those characteristics , however , the resulting basis is non - orthogonal .",
    "nevertheless , the local basis orbitals can be used as a starting point for the definition of wfs of a certain symmetry , which by construction have a high degree of localization .",
    "we follow the ideas sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite and introduce a projection of the bloch functions @xmath214 onto local test functions @xmath218 .",
    "the resulting matrix elements @xmath219 enter the phase factors @xmath220 .",
    "they assign weights to the bloch states entering the fourier transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : wffourierbloch ] ) such that the bands with the largest test function character contribute the most .",
    "it is very conceivable that optimized local basis orbitals are among the best possible choices of test functions .",
    "thus in the simplest case we choose @xmath218 to be a local orbital at the site @xmath221 with orbital quantum numbers @xmath122 .",
    "alternatively , a linear combination of local orbitals ( molecular orbital , mo ) centered at the wf center @xmath222 could be used , in which case @xmath122 denotes the characteristics of the mo .",
    "the choice of the projector singles out all the bands exhibiting a particular character . in order to construct few - band models",
    "it is often desirable to additionally project out certain parts of the band complex with a particular character , say one is interested in wfs describing the anti - bonding part only .",
    "this is achieved by introducing energy windows described by functions @xmath223 , which are basically unity in the relevant energy range and zero everywhere else .",
    "all the projectors put together define the bloch sums corresponding to the wfs @xmath224 which in general will be non - orthogonal .",
    "a subsequent symmetric orthogonalization defines the orthogonal wf bloch sums .",
    "@xmath225 where @xmath226 .",
    "the resulting phase factors @xmath227 are then used in the fourier transform eq .",
    "( [ eq : wffourierbloch ] ) to calculate the wfs .",
    "they have predominately the character of the test functions @xmath218 and approximate the bands which exhibit this character and lay in the chosen energy window .",
    "the wfs will transform according to the symmetry of the test functions . due to the construction the largest part of the wf is actually formed by the test function itself . since",
    ", we use optimized chemical orbitals as test functions , the resulting wf will have a high degree of localization .    furthermore , this construction results in wf band structures which do not only fit the band energies but also the orbital character of the bands . a band , which has predominantly a particular orbital character in the lda bands will have the character of the corresponding wannier function in the wf bands .",
    "since the wfs are constructed to resemble the orbitals the wannier character reflects the original orbital character .",
    "we confirmed this behaviour explicitely by comparing orbital / wf projected bands .    in the present work",
    ", we used the fe @xmath3 orbitals as test functions .",
    "the energy window was chosen such that the c / p-@xmath14 bonding bands where excluded from the energy window and only the 10 fe - dominated bands were included .",
    "as indicated in sec .",
    "iii , there are reasons to consider the @xmath16-dispersion close to the fermi level in the family 11 , and this becomes mandatory for the family 111 .",
    "this increases the number of parameters considerably since it is connected with hopping through several layers , and , since there are no vertical bonds , each of these hoppings adds also one vector @xmath228 or @xmath229 ( for hops from fe to c / p ) or @xmath230 or @xmath231 ( for hops from c / p to c / p or to a cation ) .    in the 11 and 111 families , at least three hops are involved from an fe layer to the next fe layer ( @xmath232 with @xmath233 ) , and hence @xmath234 with @xmath235 or @xmath236 or @xmath237 or @xmath238 or @xmath239 or @xmath240 or @xmath241 or @xmath242 are of the same order of magnitude and have to be considered together .",
