    "galaxies when characterised by their morphology or radial profiles , integrated or central colours , and total luminosity or stellar mass , exhibit a range of relationships .",
    "these include colour - morphology relations @xcite , and colour - magnitude relations separately for early - type galaxies @xcite and late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "while it was often considered that the natural dividing line was between spirals and ellipticals / lenticulars ( e.g.  @xcite ) , it was not until the multi - wavelength sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that the galaxy population was considered strongly bimodal in colour @xcite .",
    "even when considering other galaxy properties such as radial profiles , the natural division is into two galaxy populations @xcite . given that large automated imaging surveys are better at defining a galaxy s colour than morphology , it is more natural to describe a galaxy as being on the `` red sequence '' or `` blue sequence '' rather than being an `` early type '' or `` late type '' . this interpretation also has the advantage that galaxy colours are directly related to the star formation , dust and metal enrichment history of the galaxy and can thus be more readily interpreted in theoretical models .",
    "a key goal of galaxy evolution theory is to explain the bimodality and the relationships within each sequence , and there has been considerable work in this area recently ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the key ingredient of many of these models is the inclusion of feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "although agn feedback ( or its equivalent ) is implemented in different ways in each of these models , the overall effect is to suppress cooling in massive halos .",
    "for example , in @xcite the agn feedback suppresses quasi - hydrostatic cooling flows , while @xcite adopt a semi - empirical description for the agn power related to the bondi accretion rate .",
    "bimodality of galaxy colours does not directly result from these schemes , however , the agn feedback allows the star formation rate parameterisation to be adjusted in such a way as to simultaneously obtain a good description of the colour distribution at faint magnitudes and a good match to the shape of the luminosity function . in these models red galaxies at faint magnitudes",
    "are predominantly satellite galaxies of brighter systems , while at bright magnitudes the central galaxies are also red because of the agn feedback ( e.g.  fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "in the real universe , however , the association between galaxy colours and their location in the halo is unlikely to be so simple @xcite , and measurements of the dependence of galaxy colours on luminosity and redshift are an important constraint on the new generation of galaxy formation models .",
    "analysis of the relationship between galaxy colours and environment will place important constraints on the processes defining galaxy evolution .",
    "this paper provides a detailed analysis of the variation of the bimodality with stellar mass and environment .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in  [ sec : earlier - work ] , we review a series of papers providing the buildup to this paper ; in  [ sec : data ] , we describe the data ; in  [ sec : results ] , we present the results ; in  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications and compare the data with models ; and in  [ sec : summary ] , we summarise the main results",
    ". fits to the mass functions are presented in the appendix . the data represented in this paper is available at http://www.astro.livjm.ac.uk/@xmath13ikb/research/ or upon request .",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) characterised the volume - averaged colour - magnitude distribution of galaxies by fitting double gaussian functions to the colour histograms in magnitude bins .",
    "this showed that the red sequence transitioned from a broader colour distribution at @xmath14 to a narrow distribution for massive early types at @xmath15 while the blue sequence become significantly redder over the range @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( using centrally - weighted colours ) .",
    "this supported the suggestion of a transition in galaxy properties around @xmath18 @xcite and the former is consistent with faint red - sequence galaxies forming more recently @xcite but not necessarily in the richest clusters @xcite .",
    "the difference in star formation history for galaxies below and above the transition mass may be related to the balance between hydrostatic versus rapid cooling @xcite , or to the diversity of star formation histories of satellite galaxies at low masses @xcite .",
    "* hereafter paper  ii ) analysed h@xmath19 emission strength as a function of galaxy environment .",
    "the h@xmath19 equivalent width ( ew ) distribution is bimodal with the distribution of the star forming population ( blue sequence ) not depending strongly on environment .",
    "the fraction of galaxies with @xmath20  varied continuously with environmental density and there was no evidence of a break density that had been reported before @xcite .",
    "this demonstrated the importance of describing the variation of the bimodal population by comparing the number of galaxies within each population rather than using a quantity averaged over both populations .    in paper  ii , the results indicated a dependence of the star - forming fraction on scales of about 5mpc ( after accounting for local environment ) .",
    "however , the interpretation is difficult because the small - scale measurement is noisy and the large - scale measurement could actually be adding information about the small - scale environment @xcite , and @xcite found no environmental dependence on scales larger than 1mpc .",
    "it is also known that for galaxies in clusters properties can depend on environment for scales smaller than 1mpc @xcite .",
    "these argue for an @xmath12th nearest neighbour approach to measuring environmental density as the radius is smaller in high density regions and expands in low density regions where there are often insufficient galaxies on small scales ( for a fixed luminosity cut ) .",
    "* hereafter paper  iii ) extended the double gaussian fitting of paper  i to colour histograms across environment and luminosity . at fixed luminosity ,",
    "the mean positions of the sequences become marginally redder with environmental density . for the red sequence ,",
    "this can be explained by a small difference in age between low- and high - density environments of @xmath21gyr @xcite or less @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the fraction of red - sequence galaxies varied strongly with environment as measured by projected density . no effect related to velocity dispersion of a group or cluster",
    "was detected which is consistent with the morphology - density relation being similar in groups and clusters @xcite .",
    "@xcite confirmed the shifts in colour of the red and blue sequences , 0.05 and 0.1 in @xmath22 , respectively , over a factor of 100 in projected density .",
    "the red fraction varied from 0% to 70% for low - luminosity galaxies and 50% to 90% for high - luminosity galaxies",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of environment and luminosity could be unified in that the fraction of red - sequence galaxies was related to a combined quantity : @xmath23 where @xmath2 is the projected density and @xmath24 is luminosity of a galaxy with @xmath25 . in this paper , this effect is explored in more detail using a larger sample and by converting luminosity to stellar mass .",
    "in this section , the selection of data from the sdss catalogue and the derived quantities for each galaxy are described .",
    "the basics of the sdss are described in  [ sec : sdss ] while the sample selection is described in ",
    "[ sec : samples ] .",
    "the primary sample consists of spectroscopically observed galaxies but a larger sample was used to determine spectroscopic completeness (  [ sec : completeness ] ) and to measure uncertainties in environmental densities (  [ sec : densities ] ) for which photometric redshifts were determined (  [ sec : photoz ] ) .",
    "number density corrections are described in  [ sec : volume - density - corr ] .",
    "the derived quantities include absolute magnitude @xmath26 , rest - frame colour @xmath27 , inverse concentration index @xmath28 (  [ sec : absmag - colour - concentration ] ) , projected density of neighbouring galaxies @xmath2 (  [ sec : densities ] ) , and an approximate stellar mass @xmath1 (  [ sec : stellar - mass ] ) .",
    "the sdss is a project , with a dedicated 2.5-m telescope , designed to image @xmath29deg@xmath30  and obtain spectra of @xmath31 objects @xcite .",
    "the imaging covers five broadbands , @xmath32 with effective wavelengths of 355 , 467 , 616 , 747 and 892 nm , using a mosaic ccd camera @xcite .",
    "spectra are obtained using a 640-fibre fed spectrograph with a wavelength range of 380 to 920 nm and a resolution of @xmath33 .",
    "the images are reduced using a pipeline photo that measures the observing conditions , and detects and measures objects . in particular",
    ", photo produces various types of magnitude measurement including : ( i ) ` petrosian ' , the summed flux in an aperture that depends on the surface - brightness profile of the object ; ( ii ) ` model ' , a fit to the flux using the best fit of a de - vaucouleurs and an exponential profile ; ( iii ) ` psf ' , a fit using the local point - spread function .",
    "the magnitudes are extinction - corrected using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "details of the imaging pipelines are given by @xcite .",
    "once a sufficiently large area of sky has been imaged , the data are analysed using ` targeting ' software routines that determine the objects to be observed spectroscopically .",
    "the main sets of targets are : ( i ) the main galaxy sample ( mgs ) , an @xmath34 selection @xcite ; ( ii ) luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , an @xmath35 and colour - selected galaxy sample @xcite ; and ( iii ) quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ; @xcite ) .",
    "the targets from all the samples are then assigned to plates , each with 640 fibres , using a tiling algorithm @xcite .",
    "the main restriction is that two fibres can not be placed within @xmath36 on the same plate .",
    "spectra are taken using , typically , three 15-minute exposures in moderate conditions ( the best conditions are used for imaging ) . the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is typically 10 per pixel ( @xmath372 ) for galaxies in the mgs . the pipeline spec2d extracts , and flux and wavelength calibrates , the spectra .",
    "the spectra are then analysed by another pipeline that classifies and determines the redshift of the object .",
    "the redshift success is about 99% for galaxies considered in this paper .",
    "the data used in this paper are from the sdss data release four ( dr4 ) @xcite .",
    "the primary sample consists of 151642 galaxies with @xmath34 in the redshift range 0.0100.085 ( sample  c ) , with environmental densities determined from the distance to the 4th and 5th nearest neighbours with @xmath38 .",
    "however , the spectroscopic sample is not 100% complete ; some galaxies are missed because of fiber - placement restrictions or are not yet observed , and there are edges to the sky coverage .",
    "figure  [ fig : edges ] shows the sky coverage for the photometric and spectroscopic data . in order to accurately account for missed spectra and to calculate completeness corrections ,",
    "a larger photometric sample was considered .",
    "the galaxy sample selection and calculation of environmental densities are outlined below .",
    "objects were selected from the ` casjobs ' catalogue archive server with criteria @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the petrosian magnitude corrected for milky - way extinction , and @xmath41 photometric data ( ` galaxy ' table ) and spectroscopic data ( ` specobjall ' table ) where available were extracted .",
    "this produced an initial sample of 1016565 objects after removing duplicates ( sample  a ) .",
    "the next stage was to remove low - surface brightness artifacts and stars .",
    "a modified surface brightness was defined : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mean surface brightness ( sb ) within the petrosian half - light radius ( eq .  5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the slope of 0.3 per magnitude was determined empirically from the sb - magnitude distribution so that the modified quantity was a better separator for stars , galaxies and artifacts .",
    "figure  [ fig : sb - mag ] shows sb versus magnitude for various samples and the dividing lines .",
    "objects with no spectroscopy were then trimmed to @xmath44 and ` not saturated ' while spectroscopic objects were selected with @xmath45 the trimmed sample contained 850906 galaxies ( sample  b ) .",
    "spectroscopic completeness was determined from a related sample that included all spectra and was reduced to spectroscopic regions ( 634395 galaxies , 478385 with @xmath34 ) .",
    "galaxies were divided into classes based on their magnitude and the number of @xmath34 neighbours within @xmath36 ( 0 , 1 or @xmath46 ) .",
    "the completeness was given by the number with spectra divided by the total number in a class .",
    "figure  [ fig : completeness ] shows completeness versus magnitude .",
    "as expected the completeness is low above 17.77 and it becomes colour dependent ( lrg selection ) .",
    "thus , the final sample ( sample  c ) is restricted to this mgs limit where the completeness corrections are reliable .",
    "it is also clear that in order to determine the relative numbers of galaxies in different environments , it is important to account for the change in completeness as a function of the number of neighbours .",
    "neighbours within @xmath36 ( corresponding to the ` fibre collision ' radius ) .",
    "the arrow shows the limit for mgs selection ; the completeness drops prior to that because of changes in catalogue photometry and targeting algorithms .",
    "here we have used the dr4 best photometry . ]",
    "photometric redshifts were determined for sample  b using @xmath47 fitting to ` training set ' galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts . the training set consisted of 396302 galaxies out of a possible 410206 , with some galaxies rejected because of low redshift confidence , or extreme colours or colour errors .",
    "the data fitted for each galaxy were @xmath48 and 4 ` model ' colours : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the underlying assumption is that the redshift - magnitude - colour distribution is similar for the galaxies with missing spectra as for the training set .",
    "softening errors were added in quadrature , prior to determination of the @xmath47 values . these were 0.1 for the magnitude ( larger for @xmath53 ) and 0.02 for the colours .",
    "values were determined only using the errors for the galaxy being considered , not the training - set galaxies , otherwise higher weight would be given to training - set galaxies with larger errors !",
    "for testing and calibration of the redshift errors , training - set galaxies were not matched to themselves . ]",
    "the photometric redshift is then given by the weighted mean of training - set redshifts that fitted within @xmath54 ( 99% limit for 5 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the weight for each match is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a minor adjustment to reduce the implicit weight given to redshift peaks within the training set .",
    "objects with no matches within the limit or with few matches in the range @xmath57 were assumed to be outside the redshift range of the training set ( i.e.  stars , or @xmath58 ) and not considered in further analysis ( 13741 objects ) .",
    "an initial photometric redshift error was determined from the standard deviation ( with weights ) .",

    "the data available for @xmath180 is the most comprehensive , e.g. , from sdss and 2dfgrs data , but gains have been made at higher redshift @xcite . while local density measurements illuminate various environmental trends in the data , galaxies in semi - analytical models are primarily associated with dark - matter halos .",
    "the main focus of this discussion is comparing models with the data by ` measuring ' the analogous quantity to projected galaxy density in the models .",
    "our results show that the local galaxy population divides neatly into two types , and that the fraction of each type depends exclusively on a combination of stellar mass and local environment .",
    "importantly , the environmental dependence is not a second - order effect , but is at least as important as stellar mass in determining the fraction of red galaxies in a population .",
    "by contrast , in simple galaxy formation models , the characteristics of a galaxy are usually determined primarily by the mass of its dark matter halo , which is closely related to the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "that is because the formation time , cooling rate and merging history of a halo are most strongly related to its present day mass .",
    "the most important environmental consideration in most of these models is that galaxies at the centre of a dark matter halo are treated differently from non - central , or satellite galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "only the central galaxies are assumed to possess a halo of hot gas that can potentially cool and replenish the disk .",
    "in addition , there are second - order effects related to the large - scale density field that , qualitatively at least , can mimic some of the observed trends with environment @xcite , depending on how the details of star formation and feedback are treated .",
    "our results lead naturally to two questions in this context .",
    "one is , how does our measurement of environment , @xmath2 , relate to the dark matter density field @xmath181 ? and the other is whether or not galaxy formation models that are successful in other respects are also able to reproduce the observed dependence of galaxy colour on environment .",
    "we will address these questions using the @xmath182 output of the virgo consortium s millennium simulation .",
    "the details of the dark matter are described in @xcite , and we will compare with the galaxy formation models of both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these models are improved over earlier efforts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in that , by including a model of feedback from agn , they are able to better match the observed colour distribution as a function of galaxy luminosity .",
    "specifically , the inclusion of agn feedback removes most of the bright blue galaxies , and increases the colour difference between the red and blue populations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although both models include feedback from radio - jets and agn , the models use different schemes to implement the feedback .",
    "@xcite compute an energy feedback rate based on a semi - empirical model involving the mass of the host halo and that of the central black hole .",
    "their paper discusses how the expression they use is related to the bondi accretion rate .",
    "in contrast , the @xcite model assumes that agn feedback will be self - regulating if the cooling time is long compared to the sound crossing time of the system so that the cooling of gas takes place from a quasi - hydrostatic atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the model also requires that central black hole is sufficiently massive to provide heating rate .",
    "in addition to the treatment of agn jets , the models also differ in many details of the implementation of cooling galaxy merging , star bursts and many other factors .      to construct a mock - observational sample to compare with our data , we select galaxies at @xmath182 from the simulation .",
    "we restrict most of the analysis to galaxies with stellar masses @xmath183 , which typically belong to dark matter halos with at least 100 particles ( so their merger histories are reasonably well resolved ) . however , to define the local density we will select a luminosity - limited sample ( see below ) that includes lower - mass galaxies .",
    "the redshift of each galaxy is determined as @xmath184 , where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are arbitrarily taken to be the position and peculiar velocity in the @xmath88-axis - coordinate of the simulation .",
    "the simulation box is 714mpc on a side , large enough that we can select the redshift range @xmath187 to match our data sample , without the need to tile the box .. the sdss @xmath40-band luminosity is computed from the @xmath188- and @xmath189-band magnitudes in the catalogue via the transformation @xmath190 .",
    "this is based on the calibration of @xcite , with an additional 0.1mag shift to ensure the space density of galaxies with @xmath106 matches that of the data . ]",
    "we measure @xmath2 in the simulation using a similar prescription to that used for the data .",
    "specifically , for each galaxy we define a ddp as all galaxies in the galaxy catalogue brighter than @xmath106 , and within @xmath191 km / s .",
    "the distances to the fourth- and fifth - nearest neighbours within this ddp are calculated for each galaxy in the simulation , and the projected density @xmath2 is computed as for the data .",
    "we do not attempt to model the sdss spectroscopic completeness , and thus ignore the small effect of only having photometric redshift estimates in incomplete regions ( galaxies with large uncertainties are not included in the data analysis in any case ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mill - density - full ] shows how the measurement of @xmath2 compares with the smoothed dark matter overdensity , @xmath192 , computed with a gaussian kernel of radius 1.78mpc , for all galaxies in the @xcite catalogue with @xmath193 .",
    "there is a clear correlation , in that galaxies with higher @xmath2 tend to lie in regions that are overdense in dark matter .",

    "figure  [ fig : mill - density ] shows how this correlation depends on halo mass , by which we mean the mass of the largest dark matter halo associated with the galaxy ( i.e. , not the subhalo in which the galaxy may reside ) .",
    "the three sets of contours correspond to halos with masses within 0.1 of @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 . for halos of a given mass",
    ", there is a large range in @xmath2 ; thus , this estimate of local density is sensitive to variations in environment within a given halo .",
    "moreover , the distribution of @xmath2 is only weakly dependent on mass , for @xmath198 , which reflects the fact that the density structure of dark matter halos are nearly self - similar . on the other hand , the dark matter overdensity on @xmath199 mpc scales is more sensitive to halo mass , because the size of the smoothing kernel is comparable to , or larger than , the typical halo . for low - mass halos , where the number of bright @xmath38 galaxies per halo is small , @xmath2 traces dark matter overdensity reasonably well , because both are probing similar scales .    , smoothed with a gaussian kernel of radius @xmath199 mpc , and projected galaxy surface density @xmath2 , from the model of @xcite .",
    "the data are binned by 0.1 in the logarithm of each quantity , and the contours are logarithmically spaced by 0.4 with the lowest contour representing 75 galaxies per bin .",

    "the solid contours are restricted to galaxies with @xmath200 ; the dotted contours represent @xmath201 , the dashed contours @xmath202 , and the dash - and - dotted contours @xmath203 . for halos of fixed mass , @xmath2 spans a wide range , as it is sensitive to the local environment of galaxies . ]",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated that although the models of @xcite do a good job of reproducing the overall luminosity - dependence of the observed galaxy colour distribution , they do not succeed in matching the colour distribution in groups and clusters .",
    "specifically , they found that the model predicts too many faint , red galaxies in these large halos .",
    "we will investigate this further by characterising environment using the continuous variable @xmath2 , which is more closely related to the large - scale dark matter density field than to the mass of the halo .    to divide the model into red and blue galaxies we follow the approach of @xcite and make a magnitude - dependent colour cut .",
    "we find that a separation at @xmath204 provides a good separation between the red and blue populations of the model ( our results below are not sensitive to this cut , because the model populations are so well separated in colour ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mill - fred ] shows the fraction of red galaxies , using this criterion , as a function of stellar mass and local density @xmath2 .",
    "qualitatively , the models reproduce the observations well , as the red fraction increases with both stellar mass and @xmath2 . however , quantitatively there are some interesting differences .",
    "in particular , the dependence in the model is actually too strong relative to the data . at low densities ,",
    "the model predicts too few red galaxies , with a red fraction that varies from 0.05 to 0.6 over the plotted mass range .",
    "by contrast , over the same mass range , the data show a red fraction ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 .",
    "another point of interest is that the mass dependence of the red fraction in the models is weak below @xmath205 , while the data show a continuous decrease in red fraction with stellar mass over another order of magnitude . at the high - density end ,",
    "the models seem to do a better job of reproducing the high red fraction and weak stellar - mass dependence seen in the observations .",
    "the main source of the environmental dependence in the model is simply illustrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mill - fred ] , where we divide the sample into central and satellite galaxies . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "most satellite galaxies are red , independent of luminosity and density , in the models .",
    "the central galaxies , on the other hand , have a strong stellar mass dependence , and a dependence on environment that is considerably weaker than that shown by the population as a whole , in the left panel .",
    "the overall environmental trend is therefore largely due to the fact that low - density regions are dominated by central galaxies , while the high - density end is dominated by satellite galaxies .",
    "the main source of the discrepancy with the observations , therefore , can be identified as the low fraction of red galaxies amongst the central galaxies in low - density environments .",
    "figure  [ fig : mill - fred - bower ] shows the analog of fig .  [ fig : mill - fred ] for the @xcite models . in these models ,",
    "the colour - luminosity relation is significantly different from @xcite , so we have had to adopt a different definition of red galaxy , with a colour cut given by @xmath206 . for this model ,",
    "the agreement with the observations is remarkably good .",
    "the difference lies in the colour distribution of the central galaxies , for which , at all densities , a larger fraction lie in the red sequence than in the @xcite  model .",
    "this is not surprising , as the main difference between the two models lies in the treatment of agn feedback , within central galaxies .",
    "therefore , the satellite populations are largely unaffected .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xcite model fails to predict the presence of faint blue galaxies in groups and clusters , and link this discrepancy to the uniformly red satellite population that is seen here in both the @xcite  and @xcite model .",
    "this is quite a different effect from the discrepancy revealed by our results , as our data show that the fraction of red galaxies in the densest environments is nearly as high as the models predict .",
    "instead , our analysis shows a problem with the _ opposite _ population in the @xcite  model , in that the central galaxies in low - density environments are too frequently blue .",
    "interestingly , this problem does not appear to be as severe in the @xcite  model .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this improvement is due to their different prescription for agn feedback , or to some other aspect of the model . unambiguously identifying the root cause of this difference requires a more detailed comparison between the two models , which is beyond the scope of this paper .    the comparison between models and data that we have discussed and shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mill - fred][fig : mill - fred - bower ] is only the red - blue sequence galaxy fraction ; clearly colour - mass , colour - concentration relations and gsmfs could also be compared as a function of environment .",
    "however , colour - mass and colour - concentration relations are more dependent on the detailed physics of stellar and galaxy evolution such as chemical and dynamical evolution ; whereas the red fraction ( based on a colour cut dividing the bimodal population ) represents the the most significant variation with environment .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the unified relation of the red fraction versus stellar mass and environment , and we have shown that semi - analytical models with their distinction between central and satellite galaxies can match this with an appropriate feedback description ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mill - fred - bower ] ) . of course",
    "this does not mean that the @xcite model has the right answer for the galaxy bimodality as there are many other pieces of data to match , e.g. , lower mass galaxies , colour relations and gsmfs .",
    "given that the @xcite model produces a good match to the unified relation we are now in a position to interpret it in the context of the model .",
    "in the model , the likelihood that a galaxy lies on the red sequence depends on two factors .",
    "firstly , the probability that the agn feedback is able to prevent the collapse of further gas depends on the mass and dynamical time of the halo , and the mass of the central black hole .",
    "both of these factors become more effective in larger mass galaxies ( through the correlation between central galaxy mass and halo mass , and through the correlation between bulge mass and black hole mass , respectively ) . secondly",
    ", the probability that a galaxy is a satellite ( and therefore unable to accumulate cold gas ) increases as @xmath2 increases . as the galaxy mass increases , the galaxy is more likely to be central and red regardless of the @xmath2 parameter .",
    "conversely the galaxies with the lowest mass are very unlikely to be central if @xmath2 is high .",
    "thus the sensitivity to @xmath2 depends strongly on galaxy mass , and this dependence is reflected in the unified relation that we have presented .",
    "the success of the model in representing the impact of environment may at first seem surprising since the models presented do not yet include many environment - related process such as ram pressure stripping of cold disk gas and tidal interactions between satellite galaxies . in the models ,",
    "interaction with the environment occurs because the galaxies external gas reservoir is removed as it becomes a satellite galaxy orbiting within a larger halo .",
    "however , because the models assume a rapid interchange between the cold disk gas and the external gas reservoir , the loss of the external halo quickly suppresses the formation of disk stars .",
    "it seems that this provides a good approximation to the effect of the complete suite of environmental interactions .",
    "the caveat , of course , is that the process ( as currently model ) seems overly effective so that too few satellite galaxies are able to continue star formation , even in if the parent halo has relatively low mass .",
    "clearly this is an important area in which the models can be developed by introducing a more complete description for the removal of the external reservoir .",
    "we have analysed a primary sample of 151642 galaxies from the sdss determining stellar masses , rest - frame colours and projected environmental densities .",
    "the peak , or characteristic mass , of the gsmfs increase by about 0.4dex from @xmath207 to @xmath208 ( fig .",
