    "the interest to the electron spin in semiconductors has revived in recent years due to potential applications in spintronics@xcite and quantum computing.@xcite on the way to building spin - based qubits , a number of interesting spin - related phenomena have been studied experimentally in semiconductor quantum dots . for instance , single - shot read - out of an individual electron spin in a quantum dot has been demonstrated,@xcite optically programmable electron spin memory using arrays of self - assembled quantum dots has been implemented,@xcite entanglement of a two - electron correlated state has been predicted@xcite and accessed in transport measurements,@xcite mixing of singlet and triplet states in double quantum dots ( due to hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins ) has been studied,@xcite direct access to the spin - orbit interaction in nanowires has been demonstrated.@xcite the use of electron spin in quantum information requires long spin coherence times .",
    "identifying the mechanisms that govern spin decay in nanostructures is very important .",
    "knowledge about the dominant mechanism can help one build structures with the least coupling of spin to the environment and therefore increase the spin lifetimes by orders of magnitude .    in semiconductor quantum dots,@xcite",
    "the electron spin interacts with the environment via a number of interactions .",
    "the spin - orbit , hyperfine , and zeeman interactions are extremely relevant for the coherent spin dynamics .",
    "the decoherence time @xmath0 is limited by two kinds of processes : ( i ) spin - flip processes and ( ii ) dephasing processes .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath1 is determined only by spin - flip processes .",
    "the characteristic relaxation time @xmath1 is typically very long in semiconductors .",
    "recently , @xmath1 was measured in electrostatically defined lateral gaas quantum dots,@xcite observing @xmath1 from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , depending on the strength of the external magnetic field . in self - assembled ingaas quantum dots@xcite @xmath1",
    "varies from @xmath2 to @xmath4 .",
    "dephasing of spin occurs due to environmental changes that affect the phase of a coherent superposition of `` spin up '' and `` spin down '' states . in a zeeman field ,",
    "the process ( i ) is associated with exchanging energy with the environment , whereas the process ( ii ) is purely elastic and results from adiabatic ( with respect to zeeman energy ) dynamics of the environment .",
    "there are two major mechanisms that govern the electron spin lifetimes in quantum dots .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is responsible for the spin relaxation ( @xmath5 ) , limiting the spin coherence time to @xmath6 .",
    "the hyperfine interaction is responsible for the spin dephasing and gives the main contribution to the decoherence rate ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the decoherence time @xmath8 ( averaged over many runs ) has recently been accessed in experiment,@xcite finding @xmath9 and @xmath10 for a gaas quantum ( double- ) dot , in agreement with theory.@xcite the hyperfine interaction has recently been investigated experimentally in refs .  .    in gaas quantum dots ,",
    "the electrons are strongly confined in one direction and can be described by a two - dimensional hamiltonian .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is related to the absence of inversion symmetry , either in the elementary crystal cell or at the heterointerface , and is described by the spin - orbit terms in the electron hamiltonian@xcite that are linear in the two - dimensional electron momentum .",
    "these terms can be removed in the case of localized electrons by a spin - dependent unitary transformation@xcite ( for the case of delocalized electrons see ref .  ) . as a result",
    ", the contribution to the spin - flip rate proportional to the second power of the spin - orbit coupling constant appears only if one takes into account the zeeman splitting in the electron spectrum .",
    "this results in unusually low spin - flip rates . for a quantum dot defined in a two - dimensional electron layer , the linear in momentum terms in the spin - orbit interaction are dominant , provided the dot lateral size @xmath11 is much larger than the layer thickness @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction in quantum dots is a weak perturbation on top of the dot confining potential .",
    "the spin - orbit length @xmath14the distance a bulk electron travels until its spin precesses around in the spin - orbit field ",
    "is typically much larger than the quantum dot lateral size @xmath11 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction introduces small corrections ( @xmath15 ) to the spin states of the quantum dot and , more importantly , mediates a coupling between the spin and the electron orbital bath .",
    "thus , for example , the electron spin couples efficiently to acoustic phonons.@xcite coupling to a functioning qpc has also been considered.@xcite recent experiments@xcite suggest that the spin - phonon coupling dominates the spin relaxation in gaas quantum dots in strong magnetic fields ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in contrast to spin relaxation , spin dephasing due to spin - orbit interaction is inefficient in gaas quantum dots,@xcite leading to @xmath17 for a realistic system with @xmath18 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction can also be used as a means of control over the electron spin in quantum dots .",
    "an oscillating electric field couples to the electron spin via the spin - orbit interaction and produces an electric - dipole - induced spin resonance in the quantum dot.@xcite the coupling of spin to electric fields can be envisioned as being due to a spin - electric moment of electron.@xcite a dipole - dipole coupling between such moments is usually much stronger than the magnetic dipole - dipole coupling and occurs between distant spin-@xmath19 quantum dots coupled with each other only through the coulomb interaction.@xcite    two - electron quantum dots provide a unique possibility to verify the dominant mechanisms of spin relaxation in quantum dots .",
    "the two - particle ground state is a singlet at zero magnetic field .",
    "the triplet level is separated from the singlet by a sizable energy ( @xmath20 in gaas quantum dots ) . in an orbital magnetic field @xmath21",
    ", the singlet and triplet levels can be brought to intersection at @xmath22 in gaas quantum dots .",
    "the singlet - triplet splitting , @xmath23 , was studied as a function of magnetic field in a number of experiments ( see _ e.g. _ refs .  ) .",
    "furthermore , by applying an in - plane component of magnetic field , one can control the zeeman energy @xmath24 independently of @xmath25 .",
    "the triplet - to - singlet relaxation was studied in refs .   with the help of a pulsed relaxation measurement technique.@xcite in ref .",
    ", the spin lifetime reached up to @xmath26 and was limited by cotunneling processes . in ref .  , the spin lifetime reached @xmath27 and showed a clear @xmath28 dependence .",
    "in the present paper , we consider a two - electron quantum dot and calculate the triplet - to - singlet relaxation rates , applying the method used in refs .   to the two - electron case .",
    "we emphasize the necessity of three ingredients for the spin relaxation , @xmath29 where `` orbital bath '' stands for any environmental bath that couples to the electron charge . as an example of orbital bath , in this paper , we consider the electron - phonon interaction , which governs the spin relaxation in single - electron gaas quantum dots.@xcite as in the single - electron problem , the effect of the spin - orbit interaction cancels at the lowest order in the absence of the zeeman field . as a result , the lowest - order singlet - triplet relaxation rates are proportional to @xmath30 , as observed in experiment .",
    "in the two - electron case studied here , the coulomb interaction between electrons plays an important role and the relaxation rates depend on the scale @xmath25 , which can be varied by magnetic fields . in the case of acoustic phonons , an enhancement of spin relaxation",
    "is expected at a characteristic scale @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the speed of sound and @xmath11 is a lateral size of the quantum dot . for the simplicity of discussion",
    ", we do not resolve the zeeman splitting of the triplet level until the end of this section . in the regime @xmath33",
    ", we obtain a relaxation rate @xmath34 in contrast to the dependence @xmath35 found in the single - electron quantum dots.@xcite note that the experimental technique used in ref .",
    "allows one to study spin relaxation across the singlet - triplet crossing and thus to probe a wide range of energy scales,@xcite @xmath36 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction gives rise to avoided crossings of the singlet and triplet levels in a magnetic field .",
    "for the linear in momentum spin - orbit interaction , we find that the singlet undergoes avoided crossings with the triplets @xmath37 , and the energy gap which determines the anti - crossing is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the average distance between the electrons .",
    "@xmath39 is an increasing function of the coulomb interaction strength @xmath40 ( ratio of dot confinement size to effective bohr radius ) , and therefore , the energy gap @xmath41 is enhanced by coulomb interaction . at an avoided crossing ,",
    "the spin selection rules are maximally violated and one would expect a strong coupling of spins to the orbital bath .",
    "the anti - crossing energy @xmath41 is , however , very small compared to the optimal phonon - emission energy @xmath42 , and the spin - flip rate is , therefore , extremely small at the avoided crossing .",
    "[ the suppression occurs here mainly due to a small density of states of acoustic phonons at the phonon emission energy @xmath43 . ] as a result , the maximum of spin relaxation takes place away from the point of avoided crossing , at an energy @xmath25 satisfying @xmath44 .",
    "the spin relaxation rate has , therefore , a non - monotonous behavior as function of the magnetic field around the singlet - triplet transition . in the case considered here ( small zeeman energy @xmath45 )",
    ", a maxima in the spin relaxation rate occurs on each side of the singlet - triplet transition , _",
    "i.e. _ at energies @xmath46 .",
    "the coulomb interaction has two competing effects on the singlet - triplet relaxation . on the one hand",
    ", it enhances the mixing between the singlet and @xmath37-triplet states .",
    "this enhancement happens , as mentioned above , through the renormalization of the energy gap @xmath41 . on the other hand",
    ", the coulomb interaction reduces the difference between the singlet and triplet charge densities , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this effect is easy to understand on the example of a double dot . with increasing the strength of the coulomb interaction the double occupancy of the electrons on one and the same quantum dot decreases and the charge distributions of the singlet and triplet states",
    "become alike . the parameter that controls",
    "the double occupancy in the double dot is the ratio of interdot tunnel coupling to the onsite coulomb repulsion . in the case of the single dot with two electrons , the role of this parameter",
    "is played by the ratio @xmath49 .",
    "thus , in the limit @xmath50 the charge distributions of singlet and triplet coincide .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity of the singlet and triplet states to environmental fluctuations that couple to the electron charge is decreased by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the mechanism of spin relaxation in the limit of strong coulomb interaction is governed by virtual transitions to states outside the singlet - triplet sector .",
    "spin relaxation in a two - electron quantum dot has been studied theoretically in refs .  .",
    "in refs .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction hamiltonian was truncated to the subspace of the lowest lying singlet and triplet states under consideration , despite the fact that the matrix elements of the spin - orbit interaction , being proportional to the electron momentum and hence to the transition energy [ @xmath51 , couple increasingly strongly to states higher in energy .",
    "as a result , an important contribution to the spin transition amplitudes has been overlooked in refs .  .",
    "this contribution cancels out the triplet - to - singlet relaxation amplitudes calculated in refs .   at the first - order of spin - orbit interaction and in the absence of a zeeman splitting .",
    "furthermore , ref .",
    "reports a magnitude of the singlet - triplet avoided - crossing splitting on the order of the matrix element of the spin - orbit interaction ( @xmath52 ) , whereas the magnitude of the splitting is much smaller and given by the product of the matrix elements of the zeeman and spin - orbit interactions divided by the orbital level spacing ( @xmath53 ) . here",
    ", @xmath54 is the coupling constant of the linear in momentum dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction ( neglecting the rashba interaction for simplicity ) and we have assumed that @xmath55 , which corresponds to a weak or moderate coulomb interaction strength . in refs .",
    ", the spin - relaxation rates have been computed numerically and the spin - orbit interaction has therefore been accounted for to high orders of perturbation theory in a sufficiently large subspace of states .",
    "our results on the relaxation rates agree with those reported in refs .   in the regime",
    "where the second and higher order in spin - orbit interaction contributions to relaxation amplitudes can be neglected .",
    "parametrically , this regime corresponds to zeeman splittings much larger than the spin - orbit interaction matrix elements , @xmath56 .",

    "this result has the implication that the spin relaxation occurs efficiently only between the following states : @xmath828 close to an avoided crossing point , the singlet and triplet ( @xmath829 ) states are superimposed with each other and form , thus , states of no definite spin .",
    "we find , nevertheless , that the phonon emission is inefficient in this case for typical gaas quantum dots , because the transition energy is too small for the spin - phonon coupling to be relevant . as usual ,",
    "the strongest coupling to the phonons occurs at the `` optimal phonon '' emission energy.@xcite this energy is on the order of @xmath830 , which is the energy of an acoustic phonon with the wavelength equal to the dot size @xmath831 .",
    "the coulomb interaction between the electrons has a number of effects on the spin relaxation .",

    "the singlet - triplet energy @xmath25 is sensitive to the coulomb interaction and it is generally smaller than in the non - interacting case .",
    "moreover , the singlet - triplet crossing ( @xmath832 ) is possible in finite orbital magnetic fields only if the coulomb interaction is present .",

    "finally , the spin admixture mechanism that allows for the singlet - triplet relaxation to occur is essentially different in the limits of weak and strong coulomb interaction . for weak coulomb interaction ,",
    "superimposing states inside the singlet - triplet subspace is sufficient for obtaining efficient singlet - triplet relaxation . for strong coulomb interaction ,",
    "this mechanism becomes inefficient . despite the fact the states in the singlet - triplet subspace are strongly admixed to each other , the orbital parts of the wave functions of the singlet and triplet become similar to each other .",
    "more precisely , the electron charge distributions in the singlet and triplet states converge onto each other in the limit of strong coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , a different admixture mechanism , which was neglected in this paper , is responsible for singlet - triplet relaxation in the limit of strong coulomb interaction .",

    "<S> we study spin relaxation in a two - electron quantum dot in the vicinity of the singlet - triplet crossing . </S>",
    "<S> the spin relaxation occurs due to a combined effect of the spin - orbit , zeeman , and electron - phonon interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the singlet - triplet relaxation rates exhibit strong variations as a function of the singlet - triplet splitting . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the coulomb interaction between the electrons has two competing effects on the singlet - triplet spin relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> one effect is to enhance the relative strength of spin - orbit coupling in the quantum dot , resulting in larger spin - orbit splittings and thus in a stronger coupling of spin to charge . </S>",
    "<S> the other effect is to make the charge density profiles of the singlet and triplet look similar to each other , thus diminishing the ability of charge environments to discriminate between singlet and triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> we thus find essentially different channels of singlet - triplet relaxation for the case of strong and weak coulomb interaction . finally , for the linear in momentum dresselhaus and rashba spin - orbit interactions </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the singlet - triplet relaxation rates to leading order in the spin - orbit interaction , and find that they are proportional to the second power of the zeeman energy , in agreement with recent experiments on triplet - to - singlet relaxation in quantum dots . </S>"
