    "in this paper we present the first part of the construction of a calculus of pseudodifferential operators that will contain parametrices for dirac - type operators over manifolds that are generalizations of @xmath2-rank 1 locally symmetric spaces .",
    "these generalizations are complete noncompact riemannian manifolds that off a compact set have the structure @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a double fibre bundle and @xmath5 is compact .",
    "that is , @xmath5 is the total space of a fibre bundle over @xmath6 , which in turn is the total space of a fibre bundle over @xmath7 .",
    "the metrics we consider on these spaces , which we call @xmath8-cusp metrics , are metrics that as @xmath9 approaches infinity cause the two fibres to collapse at rates @xmath10 and @xmath11 for a pair of positive integers @xmath12 , while the base @xmath7 does not collapse . in the case of @xmath2-rank 1 locally symmetric spaces",
    ", the fibres will be tori , and the @xmath13 will come from the lie - theoretic weights @xcite .",
    "these algebraic manifolds have been extensively studied in @xcite , where generalized eigenfunctions are constructed and an @xmath14 index theorem is proved .",
    "the calculus we construct will also be relevant to manifolds whose metrics are conformally equivalent to @xmath8-cusp metrics . in particular , a class of metrics conformal to the * a*-cusp metrics , which we call * a*-boundary metrics , arises naturally in the analysis of * a*-cusp metric operators . given a manifold as above it is convenient to consider it as the interior of a manifold with boundary @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and where @xmath17 is a boundary defining function on @xmath15 equal to @xmath18 near @xmath19 .",
    "this is the approach we will take when these definitions are made precise in section [ section : definitions ] , and we will call such an @xmath15 a _ manifold with double - fibred boundary _ or @xmath8-manifold .",
    "we emphasize here , however , that the operators we consider act only on the _ interior _ of @xmath15 , and since their structure of degeneracy corresponds to a complete metric , we do not need to impose boundary conditions .",
    "there are several motivations for creating a pseudodifferential calculus manifolds with * a*-metrics .",
    "one of these is to develop tools to explore how analytic results about locally symmetric spaces , here particularly those of @xmath2-rank 1 , might generalize to manifolds with similar geometric structures but without strict algebraic structures .",
    "for example , it is interesting to understand what versions of the @xmath14 hodge theorem apply for such manifolds , generalizing the theorem for arithmetic locally symmetric spaces by saper and stern in @xcite or what @xmath14 index theorem might exist , generalizing that of mller in @xcite .",
    "a pseudodifferential calculus would also permit us to construct an extension of the resolvent for these manifolds , done for @xmath2-rank 1 locally symmetric spaces in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there has been recent work on analytic continuation of the resolvent of the laplacian on ( globally ) symmetric spaces by mazzeo and vasy in @xcite , who , along with mller , also continue to work on the higher rank case for locally symmetric spaces .",
    "a second motivation is to study elliptic operators on , and in particular , prove a full hodge - type theorem for , the noncompact manifolds constructed by tian and yau in @xcite as solutions of the noncompact calabi conjecture .",
    "this is part of a larger program to prove hodge theorems for manifolds with special holonomy , and is related to sen s conjecture in string theory @xcite .",
    "many mathematicians have worked in this area . to name just a few , hitchin studied the @xmath14 hodge theorem outside of the middle degree for monopole moduli spaces in @xcite .",
    "the second author , together with mazzeo and hausel , proved an @xmath14 hodge theorem for various cases of gravitational instantons in @xcite .",
    "carron has developed techniques for calculating dimensions of harmonic forms of various degrees in a variety of geometric situations , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "mazzeo and degeratu are currently writing up an @xmath14 hodge result about certain qale spaces .",
    "the hodge theorem outside the middle degree for the manifolds constructed by tian and yau was proved in @xcite , and a conjecture proposed for the middle degree case .",
    "the metrics on the manifolds in question are conformal @xmath8-metrics , and the theory in our two papers permits us to confirm the conjecture in @xcite , as will be described in a subsequent paper .",
    "a third motivation is to study spectral properties of manifolds with metrics that interpolate between infinite cylindrical ends and fibred cusp ends , both of which are interesting and well - studied classes of noncompact manifolds .",
    "it is interesting therefore to see how these can be seen as opposite limiting cases in a family of examples .",
    "a similar study , resulting in a family of hodge and signature theorems , was done for singular manifolds with metrics between finite cylinders and cone bundles off a compact set in @xcite .    finally , this work is part of a general program to construct pseudodifferential operator calculi on singular and noncompact manifolds .",
    "various groups of researchers have used different approaches to do this , including melrose and his collaborators , who construct calculi using operator kernels defined on `` blown up '' double spaces ( more on this below ) , schulze and his collaborators , for instance in @xcite , using an approach generalizing that of boutet de monvel , and recently , ammann , lauter and nistor in their paper @xcite which uses integration of lie algebroids .",
    "the calculus for double - fibred manifolds that we construct in this paper is the natural generalization and next step in the program of the melrose school after the phi - calculus of @xcite .",
    "it extends easily to the case of more than two nested fibrations .",
    "we restrict the main part of the presentation to the case of two fibrations in order to keep the notation manageable ; the essentials needed for the extension to any number of fibrations are given in an appendix .",
    "another way in which our calculus extends @xcite is that we allow arbitrary powers of degenerations ( called @xmath13 above ) for the various fibrations .",
    "this paper and its sequel build on a great deal of previous work on the construction of pseudodifferential calculi for singular and noncompact manifolds .",
    "the general approach is taken from the work by melrose , starting with his work on the b - calculus of operators over manifolds with infinite cylindrical ends @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to construct a calculus of operators through studying distributions on a `` blown up double space '' .",
    "that is , given a manifold @xmath15 as above , we identify differential and pseudodifferential operators on @xmath15 with their schwartz kernels , which are distributions on @xmath20 , and study these by lifting them to a blow - up @xmath21 .",
    "this method has been used to develop many different calculi of pseudodifferential operators , including , for instance , the scattering calculus @xcite and the 0-calculus and edge calculus , @xcite , which are all calculi designed to study geometric operators on noncompact manifolds with different types of geometry .",
    "the original b - calculus is a special case of the calculi that will be constructed in this paper , where the two boundary fibrations are trivial , as is wunsch s quadratic scattering calculus @xcite , where there is only one boundary fibration , and the scaling is given by @xmath22 .",
    "finally , the phi - calculus is suited for manifolds with fibred cusp metrics , which are metrics like those above , but where the second fibration , @xmath23 , is trivial @xcite . in 2001 , boris vaillant , a phd student working with w. mller and r. melrose , completed a dissertation supplementing the construction of the phi - calculus in a way that permitted him to prove an index theorem for fibred cusp manifolds .",
    "these two pieces of work on the phi - calculus have been much of the basis for the work in this paper and its successor . unfortunately , vaillant left mathematics after the completion of his dissertation , and this important work was therefore never revised and submitted to a journal .",
    "nevertheless , there has been a fair degree of interest in his results , which among other things have been used to prove the hodge theorem in @xcite and to prove a families index theorem for manifolds with hyperbolic cusps in @xcite , of interest in smooth k - theory of noncompact manifolds ( defined in @xcite ) and with an application to teichmller theory in @xcite .",
    "thus an additional motivation for the present work is to provide a revised and edited ( as well as generalized ) version of vaillant s work .",
    "the content of this first paper is a generalization of the material in @xcite . in it",
    "we define and study the classes of * a*-differential and * a*-pseudodifferential operators on an * a*-manifold @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath24 is a geometric operator over @xmath15 for an * a*-boundary metric , then @xmath24 will be an * a*-differential operator , and if @xmath24 is a geometric operator of degree @xmath25 associated to an * a*-cusp metric on @xmath15 , then @xmath26 will be an * a*-differential operator .",
    "these operators are elliptic in the sense that their principal symbols are invertible , uniformly up to the boundary after a suitable rescaling .",
    "a stronger condition is full ellipticity , which requires in addition invertibility of an associated family of operators on the fibres of @xmath27 .",
    "our first main theorem is :    [ th : psd - calc ] on any @xmath8-manifold @xmath15 there is an algebra of operators , @xmath28 that contains the @xmath8-differential operators and parametrices for fully elliptic elements .",
    "the elements of @xmath28 are given by conormal distributions on the blown up double space @xmath21 .",
    "here a parametrix is an inverse up to operators in @xmath29 , which are operators whose kernels are smooth on @xmath20 and vanish to infinite order at the boundary of @xmath20 .",
    "there is an obvious extension of theorem [ th : psd - calc ] to operators acting between sections of vector bundles over @xmath15 .",
    "theorem [ th : psd - calc ] applies in particular to the resolvent of the laplacian , and we obtain :    [ th : resolv ] for a manifold @xmath15 with a double - fibred boundary endowed with an * a*-boundary metric @xmath30 let @xmath31 be the hodge laplace operator on differential forms . for any @xmath32 the operator",
    "@xmath33 is an invertible fully elliptic * a*-operator of degree 2 and the resolvent @xmath34 is an element of the small * a*-calculus .",
    "we then apply theorem [ th : psd - calc ] to obtain the usual fredholm and regularity results . in the following theorem ,",
    "@xmath35 is a metric of the form @xmath36 on @xmath37 for some * a*-boundary metric @xmath30 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the associated volume form , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 , are the @xmath14 and sobolev spaces naturally associated with @xmath35 and the @xmath8-structure .",
    "[ th : mainthm ] let @xmath43 be a fully elliptic * a*-operator on an @xmath8-manifold , and let @xmath35 be a metric as described above . then @xmath44 is a fredholm operator on @xmath40 .",
    "further , if @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a tempered distribution and @xmath47 then in fact @xmath48 . in particular , all elements of the kernel and cokernel of @xmath44 in any weighted sobolev space are smooth sections that vanish to infinite order on @xmath49 .",
    "the space @xmath28 may be called the `` small '' @xmath8-calculus in the philosophy of b - type calculi , since the operator kernels have non - trivial expansions only at the highest order front face of @xmath21 . note that a fully elliptic * a*-operator is fredholm on any weighted * a*-sobolev space .",
    "this , and the vanishing to infinite order of elements of the kernel of a fully elliptic operator , is also true in the @xmath50- and scattering calculus . compare this with the b - calculus , where elliptic operators are fredholm only off a discrete set of weights , the parametrix depends on the weight and elements of the kernel have polynomial asymptotic behavior at the boundary .",
    "we also define the full @xmath8-calculus and study its mapping and composition properties . in the sequel to this paper we will show that the full @xmath8-calculus contains parametrices for a particular class of elliptic but not fully elliptic @xmath8-operators .",
    "this is an important extension , as the most geometrically interesting operators on manifolds with either @xmath8-cusp or * a*-boundary metrics , including dirac operators , belong to this class .",
    "this step is a generalization of the extension done by vaillant in his dissertation of the phi - calculus . in future papers we will apply these techniques to obtain hodge and index theorems for manifolds with @xmath8-cusp and boundary metrics .",
    "the rough outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we make several definitions necessary for the construction of the small @xmath8-calculus , then go on to a description of the geometry of the @xmath8-double space and discuss the kernels of @xmath8-differential operators lifted to this space .",
    "we then define the small @xmath8-calculus and the normal operator of an element of the small calculus , whose invertibility gives the ellipticity condition at the boundary that was discussed earlier . in section 3",
    "we define and analyze the * a*-triple space , introduce the full * a*-calculus and prove composition and mapping theorems for it .",
    "finally , in section 4 we construct the parametrix of a fully elliptic * a*-differential operator and prove the theorems stated above .",
    "let @xmath15 be a manifold with boundary , where @xmath51 is the total space of a fibre bundle @xmath52 and @xmath6 is again the total space of a fibre bundle @xmath53 .",
    "then @xmath15 is called a _",
    "manifold with double - fibred boundary_.    thus , @xmath54 comes with two fibrations , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the fibres of the latter being unions of fibres of the former .",
    "fix the notation that dim@xmath57 and dim@xmath58 , so dim@xmath59 .    for convenience we will assume throughout the paper that @xmath15 is compact .",
    "however , this is not needed for many of the considerations .",
    "the prototype of metrics we consider is the following .",
    "let @xmath15 be a manifold with double - fibred boundary and fix @xmath60 .",
    "then a metric @xmath61 on the interior of @xmath15 is called a _",
    "product - type _ * a*_-cusp metric _",
    "if for some trivialization of a neighborhood @xmath62 of the boundary , @xmath63 , it has the form , for @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a metric on @xmath7 , @xmath67 is a nondegenerate 2-form on @xmath6 that restricts to a metric on each fibre , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is a nondegenerate 2-form on @xmath54 that restricts to a metric on each fibre , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .    a _ product type _ * a*_-boundary metric _ is one of the form @xmath73 for some product type * a*-cusp metric @xmath61 , that is , has the form : @xmath74    fibred cusp metrics are closer to the intended applications , and fibred",
    "boundary metrics are more naturally associated with the calculus constructed below .",
    "note that ` product type ' refers to the fact that none of @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath70 depends on @xmath75 .",
    "the fibrations may be non - trivial .",
    "this is a stronger condition than we need for analysis , although it simplifies things if we can choose to work with such a metric , as , for instance , we can when proving hodge theorems .",
    "however , the analysis below will be carried out for a somewhat more general class of metrics having the same structure of degeneracy as @xmath76 as @xmath61 .",
    "the degeneracy as @xmath76 of these metrics and of the associated differential operators is efficiently encoded in a set of vector fields , @xmath77 , which serves as the basic object in building the pseudodifferential calculus used to analyze these operators . to make this explicit , we fix a trivialization @xmath78 and extend the fibrations @xmath79 to the interior by @xmath80 this defines a boundary defining function ( or bdf ) on @xmath62 , always denoted @xmath75 , given by the coordinate in @xmath81 , as well as the two fibrations @xmath82 and @xmath83 with total space @xmath62 and the same fibres as @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "then @xmath77 consists of those smooth vector fields @xmath86 on @xmath15 that have _ bounded length _ with respect to @xmath87 . from it",
    "is clear that these are characterized by @xmath88 here , @xmath89 , for sections of a bundle @xmath90 over @xmath15 , denotes an element of the form @xmath91 with @xmath92 a smooth ( up to the boundary ! ) section of @xmath90 .",
    "also @xmath93 is regarded as a section of the pull - back bundle @xmath94 over @xmath95 , and similar for the other maps .",
    "note that condition does not depend on @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath70 in the definition of @xmath87 ; hence we use it to define :    [ def : interior dfs ] let @xmath15 be a manifold with double - fibred boundary and @xmath96 . an _ * a*-structure _ on @xmath15 is a set of vector fields @xmath97 for some trivialization @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath15 together with an * a*-structure will also be called an _ * a*-manifold_.    condition says that @xmath86 is tangent to order @xmath98 ( as @xmath76 ) to the fibres @xmath99 of @xmath82 , tangent to order @xmath100 to the fibres @xmath101 of @xmath102 , and tangent to order @xmath103 to the fibres of @xmath75 .",
    "this shows that @xmath77 does not uniquely determine the fibrations @xmath104 , or the trivialization @xmath105 .",
    "however , it does determine @xmath104 uniquely at the boundary ( up to diffeomorphisms of the bases ) , and also to some finite orders in the interior .",
    "this is discussed in greater detail in the appendix .",
    "we assume from now on that a trivialization as in definition [ def : interior dfs ] is chosen .",
    "however , any object introduced below that is decorated with an upper index @xmath8 will be determined purely by @xmath77 and not depend on the particular choice of trivialization .    throughout",
    "we will use coordinates adapted to the trivialization and the fibrations .",

    "<S> this paper is the first of two papers constructing a calculus of pseudodifferential operators suitable for doing analysis on @xmath0-rank @xmath1 locally symmetric spaces and riemannian manifolds generalizing these . </S>",
    "<S> this generalization is the interior of a manifold with boundary , where the boundary has the structure of a tower of fibre bundles . </S>",
    "<S> the class of operators we consider on such a space includes those arising naturally from metrics which degenerate to various orders at the boundary , in directions given by the tower of fibrations . as well as </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-rank @xmath1 locally symmetric spaces , examples include ricci - flat metrics on the complement of a divisor in a smooth variety constructed by tian and yau . in this first part of the calculus construction </S>",
    "<S> , parametrices are found for `` fully elliptic differential * a*-operators '' , which are uniformly elliptic operators on these manifolds that satisfy an additional invertibility condition at infinity . in the second part we will consider operators that do not satisfy this condition . </S>"
