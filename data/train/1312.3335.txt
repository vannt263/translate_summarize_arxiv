    "the am canum venaticorum ( am cvn ) binaries are hydrogen - deficient , ultracompact , mass - transferring white dwarf binaries .",
    "this rare class of objects is characterised by their short orbital periods , which fall in the range of 5 to 65minutes , and their helium - rich spectra .",
    "the white dwarf primary accretes from a degenerate or semi - degenerate companion , allowing their periods to fall significantly below the expected period minimum of normal hydrogen - rich cataclysmic variables ( @xmath180min ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "see @xcite for a recent review of the am cvn binaries .",
    "the am cvn class is of particular interest due to their potential as progenitors of type ia supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sub - luminous sn ia - like explosions ( ` sn.ia ' ; @xcite ) .    the first am cvn binaries were discovered serendipitously in a variety of different ways , producing a small and heterogeneous sample .",
    "a total of six new am cvn binaries were discovered in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) i and sdss - ii spectroscopic data , via their helium emission dominated spectra @xcite .",
    "these provided the first well understood , homogeneous sample , that allowed @xcite to estimate the local space density by calibrating the theoretical population models .",
    "@xcite obtained a value of 13  @xmath2  10@xmath3 pc@xmath4 .",
    "this was an order of magnitude lower than the expected space density at the time , derived from population synthesis ( 2  @xmath2  10@xmath5 pc@xmath4 , based on ) .    since the known",
    "am cvn binaries have been found to occupy a relatively sparsely - populated region of colour space , which has a low spectroscopic completeness in the sdss data base , we have conducted a dedicated spectroscopic survey designed to uncover the ` hidden ' population of am cvn binaries in the sdss photometry .",
    "details of this programme , including the sample selection criteria , and the seven am cvns discovered , were presented by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we recently presented the latest results from this survey ; where we discussed increasing our am cvn detection efficiency using new colour  colour cuts based on photometry from _ galex _ , and gave our revised estimate of the am cvn space density , ( 5  @xmath0  3 )  @xmath2  10@xmath6  pc@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "more than a third of the total known population of am cvn binaries have been discovered via the sdss , though recently they have also been found increasingly via synoptic surveys here we present two new systems discovered amongst the sdss - iii spectroscopic data .",
    "motivated by their discovery , we have applied our proposed colour - cuts based on _ galex _ , whilst extending the original colour - selection in the sdss bands , to search for any further am cvns in the most recent sdss spectroscopy .",
    "the sdss - iii comprises four spectroscopic surveys , largely targeting quasars and galaxies @xcite .",
    "recent data releases have significantly increased the number of spectra available .",
    "we discovered the two new systems discussed in this article whilst examining spectra of objects targeted as white dwarfs by the sdss - iii .",
    "this motivated us to conduct a fuller search of the sdss spectroscopic data base , examining objects observed as part of the sdss - iii with colours similar to the known am cvns ( the spectroscopic observations from the sdss and sdss - ii have been well explored by previous studies , @xcite ) .    we have previously exploited the similar colours of the known am cvns to conduct a dedicated survey of objects with only photometry in the sdss data base , to search for the ` hidden ' population @xcite .",
    "the two new am cvns both have @xmath7 colours slightly outside the range occupied by the previously identified sdss am cvns , and so we have expanded @xcite s original colour selection for our new search of the spectroscopic data base , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : newcuts ] and table [ t : cuts ] .",
    "we also apply our colour - cuts based on _ galex _ nuv photometry , to increase the efficiency of our search , as these remove many of the subdwarfs and quasars from the sample @xcite .",
    "as described in @xcite , we retain objects that have extreme @xmath8 colours ( as they may be variable ) , and those that do not have a match in the _ galex _ data base .",
    "our constraints are summarised in table [ t : cuts ] .",
    "we correct colours for galactic extinction as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    ".colour selection used to search for am cvns in the sdss spectroscopic data base .",
    "we select only objects classified as a point source , with spectra that were made available in sdss data releases 8 , 9 or 10 . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .",
    "the phase folded radial velocity curve for the longer period is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : rv1137 ] .",
    "the power spectra for sdssj1505 produce a similar result , with the stronger peak corresponding to a period of 50.6min .",
    "however , with only four data points , the low radial velocity amplitude and the large uncertainties on the measurements , we do not consider this to be a reliable measurement of the orbital period .",
    "the spectra of the two new am cvn binaries are very similar to that of the long period am cvn sdssj1208 ( @xmath9min ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showing broad double - peaked helium emission with strong central spikes ( fig .",
    "[ f : spectra ] ) . due to the mass transfer rate being a steep function of the orbital period ,",
    "the spectra of am cvn binaries vary considerably with period .",
    "that these new systems have spectra that appear similar to sdssj1208 suggests that they may also be long period am cvn binaries ( @xmath1050min ) .",
    "the detection of nitrogen emission in the spectra of am cvn binaries has been used to suggest that they are more likely to have white dwarf donors than helium star donors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can not constrain the n / c ratio as there are no strong carbon lines in the optical , but the detection of ni lines likely rules out significantly evolved he star donors @xcite .    both spectra show signs of absorption wings around the hei 5875 emission line ( especially sdssj1505 ) , that could be associated with the accreting white dwarf . however , this would require a white dwarf temperature of @xmath115000k or higher , which does not seem to be compatible with the nuv flux detected for either system .",
    "it is also worth noting that at a period longer than 50min , such a temperature would be unexpectedly high , as the white dwarf should cool as the orbital period increases @xcite .",
    "we also note that where db absorption wings have been observed in other am cvn binaries , it has been strongest around bluer lines , particularly hei 4471 , and has not been noticeable around the 5875  line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". this feature may be due to interstellar na absorption , sdssj1137 shows only a red wing , and the red wing appears stronger in sdssj1505 .",
    "the continuum temperatures suggest cool accretors for both systems , this would be expected for long period systems , and helps to explain the redder than average @xmath7 colours that push these objects outside of our original colour box . even considering the low temperature of the accretor",
    ", sdssj1137 has an extremely red @xmath7 colour that puts it surprisingly close to the da white dwarf track in @xmath7 , @xmath11 colour space ( see fig . [",
    "f : newcuts ] ) .    that we found no further new systems in our search of the sdss spectroscopic data base",
    "leads us to suspect that these two systems are outliers from the main colour distribution of am cvn binaries .",
    "if they represent an additional population that is missed in our earlier systematic search @xcite , then this population is likely small , since there are only two such systems in the sdss spectroscopic data base ( compared to the nine systems with sdss spectra in @xcite s original colour box ) .",
    "the discovery of these two new am cvns should have very little effect upon previous estimates of the am cvn space density .",
