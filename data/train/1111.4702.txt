    "newton s inverse - square force law for the universal attraction of gravity successfully explained kepler s laws of planetary motion and other solar - system observations .",
    "however , with the advent of lorentz invariance , einstein s general theory of relativity integrated newtonian gravitation into a consistent relativistic framework that naturally explained the excess perihelion precession of mercury and has thus far successfully withstood various observational challenges . on the other hand , on galactic scales ,",
    "the existence of dark matter has been assumed for decades in order to resolve observational problems , such as the  flat \" rotation curves of spiral galaxies . as the nature of dark matter is still unknown ,",
    "we take the view that what appears as dark matter may very well be a novel aspect of the gravitational interaction .",
    "starting from first principles , a nonlocal generalization of einstein s theory of gravitation has been developed in recent papers  @xcite , where it is demonstrated that nonlocal gravity can naturally simulate dark matter .",
    "however , the main motivation for the development of a nonlocal theory of gravitation came from the principle of equivalence , once the general outline of _ nonlocal special relativity _ had become clear  @xcite .",
    "in nonlocal special relativity , nonlocality is induced by the _ acceleration _ of observers in minkowski spacetime .",
    "inertia and gravitation are intimately linked in accordance with the principle of equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses .",
    "hence , gravity is expected to be nonlocal as well .",
    "that nonlocality can simulate dark matter emerged later in the course of studying the physical implications of nonlocal general relativity  @xcite .",
    "in this theory of nonlocal gravity , gravitation is described by a local field that satisfies nonlocal integro - differential equations .",
    "thus gravity is in this sense fundamentally nonlocal and its nonlocality is introduced through a  constitutive \" kernel .",
    "_ this nonlocal kernel is a basic ingredient of the gravitational interaction that must ultimately be determined from observation . _",
    "a _ direct _ nonlocal generalization of the standard form of einstein s general relativity would encounter severe difficulties  @xcite ; however , it turns out that one can also arrive at general relativity via a special case of the translational gauge theory of gravity , namely , the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity .",
    "it can be shown that this theory is amenable to generalization through the introduction of a constitutive kernel .",
    "in fact , the simplest case of a _",
    "scalar _ constitutive kernel has been employed in  @xcite to develop a consistent nonlocal generalization of einstein s theory of gravitation . in this approach to nonlocal gravity , nonlocality survives even in the newtonian regime and appears to provide a natural explanation for  dark matter \"  @xcite ; that is , nonlocal gravity simulates dark matter .",
    "indeed , the nonlocal theory naturally contains the tohline - kuhn phenomenological extension of newtonian gravity to the galactic realm  @xcite .",
    "poisson s equation of newtonian gravity , @xmath0 is modified in the nonlocal theory to read  @xcite @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the newtonian gravitational potential and any possible temporal dependence of the gravitational potential @xmath3 and matter density @xmath4 has been suppressed in eq .   for the sake of simplicity . moreover ,",
    "the nonlocal kernel @xmath5 is a smooth function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , so that @xmath8 , where @xmath9 thus @xmath7 is the source of nonlinearity in eq .  .",
    "this nonlocal and nonlinear modification of poisson s equation is invariant under a constant change of the potential , namely , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "in addition , eq .   satisfies a scaling law",
    "; that is , if the matter density is scaled by a _",
    "constant _ scale factor @xmath12 , @xmath13 , then the potential is scaled by the same constant factor , @xmath14 .",
    "the functional form of the nonlocal kernel is unknown .",
    "let us tentatively assume that it does have a _",
    "dominant _ linear component @xmath15 for some gravitational systems ; that is , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a relatively small nonlinear perturbation .",
    "the physical justification for this supposition is that the implications of the _ linear _ form of eq .",
    ", for the corresponding linear gravitational potential @xmath18 , compare favorably with the physics of the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies  @xcite . in the linear approximation ,",
    "the scalar constitutive kernel @xmath5 is only a function of @xmath6 and we expect intuitively that even nonlocal gravity would weaken with increasing distance , so that @xmath5 should go to zero as @xmath19 .",
    "let us therefore start with eq .   and consider , for simplicity , a linear kernel of the form @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 in this case .",
    "furthermore , let us assume that as @xmath22 , @xmath23 falls off to zero faster than @xmath24 ; then , using integration by parts and gauss s theorem , eq .   can be written in this case as @xmath25 we assume that this fredholm integral equation of the second kind has a unique solution  @xcite , which can be expressed by means of the reciprocal convolution kernel @xmath26 as @xmath27 the conditions for the validity of this assumption will be examined in the following section . on the other hand",
    ", it is an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "that nonlocal gravity acts like dark matter ; that is , the gravitational potential in the linear regime is due to the presence of matter of density @xmath4 as well as  dark matter \" of density @xmath28 given by @xmath29 thus the laplacian of the gravitational potential is given by @xmath30 , where , in the linear approximation , @xmath28 is the convolution of @xmath4 and the reciprocal kernel @xmath31 .",

    "a similar , but more intricate , result holds when nonlinearity is taken into consideration ; that is , nonlocality still simulates dark matter , but the connection between @xmath28 and @xmath4 goes beyond eq .  .",
    "this assertion is based on the assumption that the nonlocal kernel is of the form of eq .  ; then , eq",

    ", we have @xmath43 , which means that once the nonlocal gravitational potential is known for a _ point mass _ , one can determine the potential for any mass distribution via linearity as expressed by eq .  .",
    "assuming that @xmath26 can be determined from observational data , the inverse problem must be solved to find the linear kernel @xmath15 from @xmath26 . in this paper , we study this inverse problem in connection with the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ; furthermore , we provide a general discussion of the solutions of eq .   and investigate some of their physical implications .",
    "consider the motion of stars within the disk of a spiral galaxy in accordance with the kepler - newton - einstein tradition .",
    "for revolution on a circle of radius @xmath44 about the central spherical bulge , the speed of rotation @xmath45 of a star is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass of the bulge , which we take to be the effective mass of the galaxy .",
    "observational data indicate that @xmath48 is nearly constant ; therefore , keeping the standard theory forces us to assume that mass @xmath47 has a dark component that increases linearly with @xmath49 . assuming spherical symmetry for the distribution of this dark matter",
    ", we find that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the constant asymptotic velocity of stars in the disk of the spiral galaxy .",
    "if dark matter does not exist , but what appears to be dark matter is in fact a manifestation of the nonlocal character of the gravitational interaction , then eq .   together with eq .",
    "implies that @xmath52 for @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the mass of the point source that represents the spiral galaxy and @xmath53 is a constant length . with this explicit form for the reciprocal kernel @xmath31 , eq .",
    "becomes identical to an equation that was first introduced by kuhn in the phenomenological tohline - kuhn approach to modified gravity as an alternative to dark matter .",
    "let us digress here and briefly mention some relevant aspects of the _ linear _ phenomenology associated with the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies . to avoid the necessity of introducing dark matter into astrophysics , tohline  @xcite suggested in 1983 that the newtonian gravitational potential of a point mass @xmath32 ( representing , in effect , the mass contained in the nuclear bulge of a spiral galaxy ) could instead be modified by a logarithmic term of the form @xmath54 here @xmath55 , where @xmath51 is the approximately constant rotation velocity of stars in the disk of a spiral galaxy of mass @xmath32 .",
    "thus the constant length @xmath56 is of the order of 1kpc ; henceforth , we will assume for the sake of definiteness that @xmath57 10 kpc .",
    "it follows that in this modified gravity model @xmath58 , which disagrees with the empirical tully - fisher law  @xcite .",
    "the tully - fisher relation involves a correlation between the infrared luminosity of a spiral galaxy and the corresponding asymptotic rotation speed @xmath51 .",
    "this relation , in combination with other observational data regarding mass - to - light ratio for spiral galaxies , roughly favors @xmath59 , instead of @xmath58 that follows from tohline s proposal . on the physical side , however , it should be clear that the tully - fisher empirical relation is based on the electromagnetic radiation emitted by galactic matter and thus contains much more physics than just the law of gravity for a point mass  @xcite .",
    "tohline s suggestion was taken up and generalized several years later by kuhn and his collaborators  see  @xcite and an illuminating review of the tohline - kuhn work in  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in kuhn s linear phenomenological scheme of modified gravity  @xcite , a nonlocal term is introduced into poisson s equation , namely , @xmath60 \\,,\\ ] ] such that for a point source , @xmath42 , eq .   is a solution of eq .  .",
    "it follows immediately from a comparison of eq .   with eq .",
    "that @xmath61 therefore , to make contact with observational data regarding the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , we suppose , as in previous work  @xcite , that the reciprocal kernel @xmath31 in eq .",
    "is approximately given by the kuhn kernel in eq .   from the bulge out to the edge of spiral galaxies .",
    "a remark is in order here regarding the nature of @xmath56 . while for a _ point _ mass , @xmath56 in eq .",
    "is a universal constant , the situation may be different for the _ interior _ potential of a bounded distribution of matter .",
    "consider , for instance , the newtonian gravitational acceleration for a uniform spherical distribution of density @xmath62 and radius @xmath63 .",
    "the exterior acceleration has the universal form @xmath64 for @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ; as expected , this is identical to the acceleration for a point source of fixed mass @xmath32 . for @xmath67 , the interior newtonian gravitational acceleration at a fixed radius @xmath49",
    "is given by @xmath68 , which decreases with increasing @xmath63 when @xmath32 and @xmath49 are held fixed .",
    "extrapolating from this natural consequence of newtonian gravity to the nonlocal domain , one might expect that in the interior of spiral galaxies , for instance , @xmath56 in eq .   might depend on the size of the system .",
    "indeed , in kuhn s work , @xmath56 , with a magnitude of more or less around 10 kpc in eq .",
    ", is taken to be larger for larger systems  @xcite .",
    "rotation curves of spiral galaxies can thus provide some information regarding the nature of the reciprocal kernel @xmath26 in the linear case , where eq .",
    "can be directly compared with the tohline - kuhn scheme .",
    "however , to determine the corresponding nonlocal kernel @xmath15 , we need to know the functional form of @xmath26 over all space",
    ". the simplest possibility would be to assume that @xmath69 holds over all space ; however , the corresponding @xmath70 does _ not _ exist  see  @xcite , especially appendix e , for a detailed discussion of this point .",
    "we therefore take up the crucial question of the existence of the linear kernel @xmath70 for spiral galaxies in sections ii and iii .",
    "the general _ nonlinear _ inverse problem of nonlocal gravity is beyond the scope of this paper ; therefore , we concentrate in sections ii and iii on the linear problem of finding @xmath70 from certain very simple extensions of @xmath71 beyond @xmath72 that is implied ( in the galactic disk ) by the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "we then turn to the other main goal of this paper , which is to tackle the general _ nonlinear _ form of eq .  .",
    "unfortunately , the general form of the nonlocal kernel is unknown at present . nevertheless , a formal treatment of eq .",
    "is developed in sec .",
    "iv without recourse to eq .   or any specific assumption about the nature of the nonlocal kernel .",
    "as an application of this new approach , we consider the gravitational potential of a _ point mass _ in sec .",
    "v. physically , we regard the point mass as an idealization for a spherical distribution of matter ; in practice , it will stand , for instance , for the mass of a spiral galaxy , most of which is usually concentrated in a central spherical bulge  see , in this connection , section iv of  @xcite .",
    "the _ linear _ regime , where the kernel is independent of @xmath7 , will be investigated in the first subsection of sec .",
    "v ; in fact , we illustrate the effectiveness of our procedure by demonstrating how previous results can be recovered in the new setting .",
    "specifically , we show that the tohline - kuhn scheme can be recovered in this case from the general treatment of sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi contains a discussion of our results .",
    "the nonlocal theory of gravitation under consideration in this paper is based on the existence of a suitable  constitutive \" kernel @xmath5 . for the gravitational potential of spiral galaxies ,",
    "we assume at the outset that @xmath5 contains a dominant linear part @xmath70 and a nonlinear part that we can ignore in the context of the present discussion .",
    "the reciprocal of @xmath70 for a spiral galaxy is expected to be of the form of the kuhn kernel   in order that the nonlocal theory could simulate dark matter and be therefore consistent with observational data .",
    "it turns out that with the simple form of @xmath31 given in eq .",
    ", the corresponding reciprocal kernel does _ not _ exist .",
    "that is , if we naturally extend the simple kuhn kernel to the whole space beyond a galaxy , then there is an infinite amount of simulated dark matter and we have a @xmath72 for which there is no finite @xmath70 .",
    "however , the nonlocal theory is based on the existence of a finite smooth nonlocal kernel .",
    "this important problem is taken up in this section . to determine @xmath70 from its reciprocal , it is necessary to extend the functional form of kernel   so that it becomes smoothly applicable over all space and falls off rapidly to zero at infinity .",

    "we must ensure that its reciprocal @xmath70 , the constitutive kernel of nonlocal gravity in the linear regime , indeed exists and properly falls off to zero as @xmath73 . to this end , we show in this section that it is sufficient to require that @xmath71 and @xmath70 be smooth absolutely integrable as well as square integrable functions over all space , so that their fourier integral transforms exist as well .    in the _ linear _ newtonian regime of nonlocal gravity , the nonlocally modified poisson equation is a fredholm integral equation of the second kind , cf .",
    ", @xmath74 which we assume has a unique solution that is expressible by means of the reciprocal kernel @xmath31 as @xmath75 the inverse problem , however , involves finding @xmath15 once @xmath26 is known ; that is , we wish to obtain eq .   starting from eq .  .",
    "let us note that our methods can be used in either direction due to the obvious symmetry of eqs .   and  .",

    "it is _ formally _ possible to obtain eq .   from eq .  ,",
    "or the other way around , by the application of the liouville - neumann method of successive substitutions  @xcite . that is , we start with eq .   and write it in the form @xmath85 then , we replace @xmath86 in the integrand by its value given by eq .  .",
    "iterating this process eventually results in an infinite series  namely , the neumann series  that may or may not converge .",
    "a uniformly convergent neumann series leads to a unique solution of the fredholm integral equation  .",
    "moreover , one can determine @xmath87 in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "the procedure for calculating kernel @xmath87 of eq",
    ".   in terms of the iterated @xmath31 kernels has been discussed , for instance , in  @xcite ; however , a sign error there in the formula for iterated kernels must be corrected : an overall minus sign is missing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 3 ) of  @xcite .",
    "the spherical symmetry of @xmath31 , in the cases under consideration in this section , implies that all iterated kernels are functions of @xmath88 .",

    "using the approach developed in  @xcite , and working in the hilbert space of square - integrable functions , it can be shown by means of the schwarz inequality that the neumann series converges and the nonlocal kernel exists for @xmath94 ; moreover , the solution of the fredholm integral equation   by means of the neumann series is _ unique_. however , the norms of the convolution operators of interest in our work are not square integrable , since @xmath95 so that the standard hilbert space theory developed in  @xcite is not applicable here . that is , the @xmath96 norm of @xmath31 could be finite , but the norm of the corresponding convolution operator in @xmath96 is infinite .    on the other hand , let us suppose that the space of functions of interest is a banach space @xmath97 and that @xmath98 is a bounded linear operator on @xmath97 , @xmath99 , with @xmath100 ; then , one can show that @xmath101 has an inverse given by @xmath102 , where the series converges uniformly in the set of all bounded linear operators on @xmath97 . in this formula ,",
    "@xmath103 in the series corresponds to the iterated kernel @xmath104 , @xmath105 in the neumann series and the convergence of the series is equivalent to the existence of kernel @xmath87 .",
    "it seems that the sufficient condition @xmath100 for the convergence of the neumann series can not be satisfied for any physically reasonable extension of the kuhn kernel  ; that is , our various attempts in this direction have been unsuccessful . in short ,",
    "the neumann series diverges ; therefore , we resort to the fourier transform method in this work .    we caution that our mathematical approach may not be unique , as the theory may work in other function spaces that we have not considered here .",
    "the general mathematical problem is , of course , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "following well - known mathematics ( see , for example ,  ) , precise conditions can be determined for our convolution operators to be invertible .",

    "we note in passing that the successive approximation method of the previous section leads in this case to the standard liouville - neumann solution of eq .   via iterated kernels of the fredholm integral equation of the second kind  @xcite ; however , as discussed sec .",
    "ii , the neumann series diverges in this case and the corresponding solution does not exist under physically reasonable conditions .",
    "therefore , we adopt the fourier transform method and let @xmath71 be the kernel that is reciprocal to @xmath70 ; then , @xmath314 is given by the linear integral operator , with @xmath87 replaced by @xmath31 , acting on @xmath315 .",

    "starting from our general solution of the modified poisson equation , we again recover the tohline - kuhn scheme of modified gravity .      to gain some insight into the role of nonlinearity in eq .",

    "we thus expand @xmath3 to first order in @xmath322 and thereby develop a simple linear perturbation theory for eq .",
    "such that @xmath325 here @xmath326 is given in general by eq .",

    "this feature is an example of the general scaling property of eq .  , which implies that any solution @xmath3 of eq .",
