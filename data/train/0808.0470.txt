    "gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking to the standard model sector @xcite is an interesting alternative to gravity mediation .",
    "a considerable attention has recently been paid to gauge mediation models with very heavy messengers and the gravitino mass in the gev range @xcite , as a phenomenologically interesting possibility .",
    "gravitino in that mass range is a viable dark matter candidate , consistently with a high reheating temperature needed for leptogenesis .",
    "on the other hand , there has been a revival of interest in oraifeartaigh - type mechanism of @xmath2-term supersymmetry breaking @xcite as the source of supersymmetry breaking in gauge mediation scenarios , see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this is partly motivated by the wide recognition of the role of metastable supersymmetry breaking vacua in models with @xmath3-symmetry broken spontaneously and/or explicitly by a small parameter @xcite . with explicit models of supersymmetry breaking in gauge mediation scenarios at hand and with special interest in high scale supersymmetry breaking vacua , it is important to investigate in detail the role of gravity in such scenarios .",
    "any physically acceptable model of spontaneous symmetry breaking needs gravity for eliminating massless goldstino by the super - higgs mechanism .",
    "but gravity may also be important for determination of the supersymmetry breaking vacua .",
    "a simple example is a model discussed in @xcite with the superpotential containing a linear term of a gauge singlet chiral superfield @xmath4 responsible for supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "the messengers @xmath5 and @xmath6 , transmitting the supersymmetry breakdown to the visible sector , transform as @xmath7 and @xmath8 of @xmath9 and are coupled to the field @xmath4 .",
    "the superpotential reads @xmath10 and the form of the khler potential , @xmath11 takes into account the loop corrections representing the logarithmic divergence in the effective potential coming from the effects of the massive fields in the oraifeartaigh model which have been integrated out .",
    "the sign of the second term in the khler potential is negative here . for @xmath12 supersymmetry",
    "is broken by @xmath13 and @xmath4 is stabilized at @xmath14 .",
    "supersymmetry is however restored by turning on the coupling @xmath15 .",
    "the supersymmetric global minimum is at @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "coupling the model to gravity changes the vacuum structure .",
    "supersymmetric vacuum is still present as a global minimum ( with shifted values of the fields ) but in addition a local ( metastable ) minimum with broken supersymmetry appears , with vanishing vevs for the messengers fields .",
    "a constant @xmath18 is added to the superpotential to cancel the cosmological constant at the metastable vacuum .",
    "another fact worth mentioning is that , with gravity , after decoupling the messengers ( @xmath12 ) the supersymmetric vacuum disappears ( as in the case without gravity ) but the minimum is for @xmath4 different from zero . in the above discussion , the role of gravity",
    "is linked to the negative sign of the second term in the khler potential , which follows from the oraifeartaigh model",
    ". however , more general models of a similar type can give positive sign for that term and @xmath4 can be stabilized away from the origin , with broken supersymmetry @xcite , with or without messengers even in the limit @xmath19 .",
    "one can expect that the role of gravity is then more subtle .    in both cases ,",
    "the models without messengers can be used for supersymmetry breaking and @xmath2-term vacuum uplifting in the gravity mediation scenarios @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this note is to investigate a certain broad class of oraifeartaigh - type models ( ort models ) @xcite as the mechanism for supersymmetry breaking in gauge mediation scenarios , coupled to gravity .",
    "the ort models for supersymmetry breaking may contain only sm singlets and then for gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking they must be supplemented with the messenger sector .",
    "the ort models may themselves contain fields charged under sm gauge symmetries , participating in the dynamics of supersymmetry breaking and simultaneously transmitting it to the sm .",
    "finally , the supersymmetry breaking sector may obey the @xmath9 symmetry or @xmath9 symmetry may be explicitly broken by the masses and couplings .",
    "the gravity sector may or may not contain additional fields ( moduli ) .",
    "we investigate the vacuum structure of the globally supersymmetric models and after coupling them to gravity .",
    "we find that in the latter case , metastable local minima with broken supersymmetry exist only for the values of the supersymmetry breaking field x stabilized below certain upper bound of order @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , at the tree level , there always exists a stable polonyi - type minimum with @xmath21 but we are interested only in the vacua with @xmath4 stabilized at values such that quantum corrections from the messenger and oraifeartaigh sectors are under perturbative control .",
    "this result has interesting implications for the possible importance of gravity mediation relative to gauge mediation ( see also @xcite ) in models where gravity is coupled to the ort models of supersymmetry breaking , in the presence of charged under sm gauge group messengers . after coupling to gravity , in metastable vacua gauge mediation remains always the dominant mechanism .",
    "another version of the same conclusion is that , in moduli stabilization models with @xmath2-term uplifting in metastable vacua , adding messengers changes gravity mediation into dominantly gauge mediation . at the same time , our results show that gauge mediation with messenger masses up to @xmath22 and gravitino mass up to @xmath23 is a viable possibility .",
    "we investigate some phenomenological consequences of such scenarios .",
    "one question is whether the range of values of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters consistent with the electroweak breaking can be compatible with giudice - masiero mechanism @xcite .",
    "the idea of employing gravity to solve the @xmath0 problem of gauge mediation bears some resemblance to the motivation of @xcite , though the tools we use and the models we build are quite different .",
    "we begin in section [ sec2 ] by reviewing globally symmetric ort models and classifying them according to the existence or nonexistence of supersymmetry breaking vacuum with @xmath24 . in section [ sec30 ]",
    "we discuss the role of gravity .",
    "we show that coupling to gravity has important implications for the accessible range of values for stabilized @xmath4 .",
    "we also consider the gravity sector with moduli fields and discuss the moduli stabilization in this context .",
    "we also review scenarios that , potentially , could lead to the dominance of gravity mediation in our present general set - up . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we turn our attention to ort models in which the messenger sector does not exhibit the unified @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "such models have been advocated in @xcite as a possible remedy to the fine - tuning problem of the mssm .",
    "we study some simple but viable examples of these models and determine their properties .",
    "we then proceed to section [ sec5 ] where we discuss the phenomenological implications of the models studied in sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec4 ] in the presence of the upper bound on the value of @xmath4 found in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec6 ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we discuss globally supersymmetric ort models .",
    "a simple reference model is the original oraifeartaigh model itself @xcite , with its effective form mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we consider a single field @xmath4 with @xmath25 and with a linear term in the superpotential , and a sector consisting of @xmath26 pairs of fields @xmath27 , @xmath28 belonging to @xmath29-dimensional conjugate representations of a gauge group . by 2 in our subsequent formulae . in the case of singlets",
    "we may also have to impose a parity symmetry under which these fields are odd , in order to distinguish them from the field @xmath4 . ]",
    "we assume that at tree level these fields have canonical khler potential and that their interactions are described by the most general superpotential consistent with @xmath3 symmetry : @xmath30 where the mass parameter @xmath31 can be nonzero if and only if @xmath32 , and the coupling @xmath33 can be nonzero if and only if @xmath34 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can order the fields so that the @xmath35 do not increase and @xmath36 do not decrease with @xmath37 .",
    "interactions of @xmath4 with @xmath28 and @xmath38 induce an effective potential for @xmath4 . in the leading order in the parameter @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a representative mass scale of @xmath41 , the presence of the effective potential can be accounted for by introducing a correction to the khler potential @xcite : @xmath42 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the cutoff of the theory ( we take it equal to @xmath43 ) and we denote by @xmath44 the @xmath4-dependent mass matrix for @xmath45 , @xmath27 .",
    "it is known that gaugino masses generated at one loop are proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , in order to generate gaugino masses at one loop , @xmath47 must depend on @xmath4 .",
    "however , in @xcite , it is shown that for @xmath48 @xmath3-symmetry implies that @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in order to generate gaugino masses at one loop , @xmath50 must be singular in the limit @xmath51 ( i.e.  matrix @xmath52 must have at least one zero eigenvalue ) @xcite .",
    "one possibility of constructing such a model consists in choosing @xmath3-charges so that @xmath50 can be split into a singular and nonsingular part as : @xmath53 where the matrix @xmath54 is the maximal submatrix of @xmath50 such that @xmath55 does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "we now denote by @xmath56 the submatrix of @xmath15 which has not been included in @xmath57 .",
    "a few comments are in order here .",
    "firstly , the form ( [ block ] ) is by no means necessary for constructing a successful model of supersymmetry breaking and its mediation to the visible sector , as shown explicitly in @xcite and as we show later in appendix b with our examples ( v ) and ( vi ) .",
    "however , the form ( [ block ] ) is a perfectly admissible possibility , dependent only upon the assignment of the @xmath3-charges and we thereby find it interesting to explore the structure of such models .",
    "the two sectors of the @xmath28 and @xmath38 fields distinguished by ( [ block ] ) need not belong to the same gauge representation .",
    "indeed , for generating soft supersymmetry breaking masses of the mssm fields only the sector coupled to @xmath58 has to transform nontrivially under the gauge group ( we shall call it the messenger sector ) , while it is possible that the sector coupling to @xmath57 consists only of gauge singlets .",
    "however , the nonsinglets of the latter sector ( which we shall call the oraifeartaigh sector ) , if present , can give contributions to the masses of the mssm scalars . these contributions are of the order of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a typical mass scale of @xmath57 , so they can ( but do not have to ) be much smaller than the contribution of the first sector which are of the order of @xmath61 .    finally , up to the presence of the messenger sector which becomes massless in the limit @xmath62 , the models characterized by ( [ block ] ) are the type i models of @xcite , and we shall henceforth refer to them in this manner .",
    "we shall now discuss the vacuum structure of that class of globally supersymmetric models under the additional assumption that messengers becoming massless in the limit @xmath63 give negligible contribution to the khler potential ( [ eff2 ] ) .",
    "thus , we assume that the block @xmath57 in ( [ block ] ) gives the dominant contribution to ( [ eff2 ] ) .",
    "a global unitary transformation of the fields of the same @xmath3-charge allows writing @xmath64 with real and positive @xmath41 .",
    "the case of degenerate mass parameters can be treated as a simple limit of a nondegenerate spectrum .",
    "we can then expand the correction ( [ eff2 ] ) to the khler potential in powers of @xmath65 as : @xmath66 in ( [ eff2a ] ) we have extracted the overall dependence on the representative mass scale @xmath40 and coupling strength @xmath67 , so that the dimensionless functions @xmath68 depend only on ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 . note that the scale @xmath71 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ kitanokaehler ] ) is now given ( for @xmath72 ) by @xmath73 and it can be significantly larger than the scale @xmath74 . in terms of the coefficients @xmath75 , the scalar potential ( with vanishing vevs of the messenger fields ) @xmath76 reads for @xmath77 : @xmath78\\ , .. \\ ] ] in this expansion we denoted by @xmath79 terms of higher order in @xmath65 as well as contributions from the messenger sector .",
    "we also suppressed the effects of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 in ( [ eff2a ] ) .",
    "the former amounts to overall rescaling of the superpotential and the latter restores canonical normalization of @xmath4 by rescaling @xmath82 ; both are corrections of higher order in powers of @xmath83 .",
    "obviously , the vacuum structure in the limit @xmath84 depends on the signs of the coefficients @xmath85 and @xmath86 . for @xmath72 there is a minimum for @xmath16 with broken supersymmetry .",
    "we see the correspondence to the discussion in the introduction . turning on the couplings",
    "@xmath56 we recover supersymmetric minimum at @xmath16 . for @xmath87",
    "the extremum is for @xmath24 and its character depends on the sign of @xmath86 .",
    "also the value of @xmath4 in the extremum depends of @xmath86 .",
    "turning on the couplings @xmath56 we get a global supersymmetric minimum at @xmath16 , too , but for @xmath88 the metastable minimum at @xmath89 and with broken supersymmetry is still present .",
    "the presence of a supersymmetry breaking minimum with @xmath24 may be endangered by turning on couplings @xmath56 in three ways : a large contribution of @xmath56 to the scalar potential or a development of tachyonic masses in the @xmath4 and/or messenger sector .",
    "none of these situation occurs if , parametrically , @xmath90 . since the sign of @xmath85 distinguishes between the two significantly different possibilities , it is interesting to determine @xmath85 for a generic oraifeartaigh sector",
    ". generally , the functions @xmath68 depend in a rather complicated way on the original model parameters . a general method for finding them and explicit results for a somewhat simplified class of models , in which one can write @xmath91 ,",
    "are presented in appendix a. using these results , we can calculate @xmath85 and , if necessary , @xmath86 in general type i models , as shown with a few simple examples in appendix b.    we have so far assumed that the model is described by the reducible matrix ( [ block ] ) .",
    "we have briefly analyzed the necessary conditions for the messenger sector not to affect the position of a metastable supersymmetry breaking minimum ( if it exists ) .",
    "here we would like to extend the class of models under consideration by still keeping the reducible form of the matrix @xmath92 but replacing the submatrix @xmath58 in ( [ block ] ) by @xmath93 writing this expression we assumed that in the messenger sector all the fields @xmath27 have different @xmath3-charges and that all the fields @xmath45 have different @xmath3-charges .",
    "the generalization consists in adding explicit mass terms in the messenger sector , but in such a way that in the limit @xmath51 the matrix @xmath94 has at least one zero eigenvalue and the gaugino masses can be generated . in the language of @xcite ,",
    "our model is now a hybrid of a type i and type ii model which is classified there as a type iii model . from now on we shall assume that all the mass terms @xmath95 are nonzero , otherwise @xmath96 can be split in two independent blocks whose contributions to the effective potential add up .",
    "we would like to check if the present form of the messenger sector can result in developing a supersymmetry breaking minimum with @xmath24 despite @xmath72 .",
    "as before we can extract a representative coupling strength @xmath97 and a representative mass scale @xmath98 and define coupling and mass ratios as @xmath99 and @xmath100 . around @xmath16",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath101 can then be expanded as @xmath102 and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 .",
    "the effective khler potential ( [ eff2 ] ) can then be expanded as : @xmath105\\ , .",
    "\\label{eff2d}\\ ] ] in ( [ eff2d ] ) we included the lowest - order nontrivial monomial ( recall that a @xmath81 in @xmath106 only rescales @xmath4 ) and the only term proportional to @xmath107 .",
    "for simplicity we also assumed that the messenger and the oraifeartaigh sector are made of the same representations .",
    "we also set @xmath108 and @xmath109 assuming that this choice leads to a reliable expansion of @xmath106 .",
    "now @xmath85 is a sum of two contributions : one from the oraifeartaigh sector and the second coming from the messenger sector .",
    "the latter can also be calculated from our formulae in appendix a with @xmath110 replaced by @xmath111 for @xmath112 and with additional contributions from @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the logarithmic term in ( [ eff2d ] ) generates an additional contribution @xmath116 to the expansion of the effective potential . for small values of @xmath65 the negative logarithmic term may compensate a positive value of @xmath85 to generate a metastable minimum with @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath87 then both the quartic and the logarithmic term in ( [ eff2d ] ) pull @xmath4 away from zero and one should consider higher - order terms to find the position of the minimum .",
    "a particular case of this scenario is a possibility that the oraifeartaigh sector is absent and a metastable supersymmetry breaking minimum arises only through interactions of the messenger sector ( type ii models of @xcite ) .",
    "some examples of models in which the messenger sector can affect the position of the supersymmetry breaking minimum are discussed in appendix b.    we have so far assumed that the interactions stabilizing @xmath4 at the supersymmetry breaking minimum obey a unified @xmath9 symmetry ( which includes the case of the oraifeartaigh sector consisting of gauge singlets ) .",
    "it has been argued that going beyond this assumption may lead to interesting phenomenological consequences ( e.g.  higgsino ( n)lsp , light gluinos and/or stops , small fine - tuning ) in both gravity mediated @xcite and gauge mediated @xcite scenarios of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "such models ( with gauge mediation ) will be discussed in section [ sec4 ] .    in conclusion , we have discussed in this section globally supersymmetric ort models .",
    "it is clear that the vacuum structure of such models depends on their details .",
    "both options are open : they may or may not have metastable supersymmetry breaking vacua , with @xmath89 .",
    "in this section we couple an ort model to gravity , as an illustration of gravity effects on such models .",
    "we have checked that those effects are generic and our results apply to all models considered here .",
    "they are of two kinds : one can be anticipated on the basis of the results of @xcite  for ort models with @xmath72 , i.e. with no minimum with broken supersymmetry and @xmath89 , gravity effects lead nevertheless to a metastable minimum of that kind .",
    "the other gravity effect is universal  for models with and without metastable minimum with @xmath89 in the global limit , inclusion of gravity leads to the vacuum structure such that there is an upper bound on the values of @xmath4 in the metastable vacua , @xmath117 .",
    "in addition , for the same values of parameters , there always exist a tree - level polonyi - like minimum with broken supersymmetry and with @xmath21 . clearly , those effects have interesting physical implications for the gauge mediation models , to be discussed in the next section .    in supergravity ,",
    "the scalar potential for @xmath4 is given by : @xmath118\\ , , \\ ] ] where we take @xmath119 to be the sum of the canonical khler potential and the one - loop correction ( [ eff2 ] ) , and we assume that the superpotential @xmath120 is ( [ or1 ] ) plus a constant term @xmath18 necessary to cancel approximately the cosmological constant .    for @xmath121 , the scalar potential can be written in a form similar to ( [ vgeff ] ) : @xmath122\\ , , \\label{vgeff2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first and second @xmath79 denote term of higher orders in @xmath4 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "the basic difference between the scalar potential in supergravity and in the globally supersymmetric case ( [ vgeff ] ) is the presence of odd powers of @xmath4 @xcite . in particular ,",
    "if the minimum at @xmath16 exist in the global limit , i.e.  @xmath72 , then the linear term always destabilizes it , shifting it to a nonzero value . as an illustrative example we consider a model admitting both types of vacua , depending on the values if its parameters , namely , that described in appendix b , in example ( iii ) with @xmath124 . upon identification @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 ,",
    "this model is equivalent to the model with singlet fields and the superpotential : @xmath128 a model described by ( [ wshih ] ) has been extensively studied in the global limit in @xcite . here",
    "we couple it to gravity and we again assume that the messenger sector does not affect the position of the local supersymmetry breaking minimum . when @xmath129 the effective potential ( [ vgeff2 ] ) vanishes in the limit @xmath130 .",
    "only small corrections to this relation are necessary to make the cosmological constant vanish at the supersymmetry breaking local minimum of the potential with @xmath24 and we shall use this approximate relation from now on .",
    "functions @xmath85 and @xmath86 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eff2a ] ) , have the following form : @xmath131 as shown in @xcite , the function @xmath85 is positive for @xmath132 and negative otherwise ( see also figure [ fex3 ] in appendix b ) .",
    "the function @xmath86 is positive for @xmath133 , thereby ensuring ( in the global limit ) the existence of a metastable supersymmetry breaking minimum whenever @xmath87 .    ,",

    "for @xmath87 and @xmath88 we recover the minimum previously discussed in the context of globally supersymmetric model : @xmath139 for @xmath72 the position of the supersymmetry breaking minimum is determined by a balance between terms linear and quadratic in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the solution reads then : @xmath140 where , as before , @xmath71 appearing in ( [ kitanokaehler ] ) is given by @xmath73 . finally , we may have @xmath141 , leading to a dominance of the quartic term over the quadratic one .",
    "we find then : @xmath142 note that including the supergravity corrections to the effective potential is crucial for the existence of solutions ( [ ksol ] ) and ( [ ssol2 ] ) , for which @xmath143 is proportional to negative powers of @xmath43 .",
    "all the three solutions ( [ ssol1])-([ssol2 ] ) break @xmath3-symmetry @xcite : in ( [ ssol1 ] ) @xmath3-symmetry is broken spontaneously , whereas the form of ( [ ksol ] ) and ( [ ssol2 ] ) shows that explicit soft @xmath3-symmetry breaking ( the constant term @xmath18 in the superpotential ) is transmitted to @xmath143 through gravitational interactions . in figure",
    "[ fmphi ] , we present results of numerical analysis for @xmath135 , @xmath134 and @xmath144 , basically corresponding to the solutions ( [ ssol1 ] ) , ( [ ssol2 ] ) and ( [ ksol ] ) , respectively , in terms of the original parameter @xmath52 in ( [ wshih ] ) .",
    "we conservatively assumed a rather large value @xmath137 .",

    "pairs of solid lines show the solutions ( [ ssol1 ] ) and ( [ ssol2 ] ) for @xmath135 and @xmath134 , and the solutions ( [ ksol ] ) and ( [ ssol2 ] ) for @xmath144 .",
    "the dashed lines show @xmath138 , i.e.  the value of @xmath4 for which the expansion in ( [ eff2a ] ) is expected to break down .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that all the three solutions can be realized in the simple model ( [ wshih ] ) , depending on the value of the mass ratio @xmath3 .",
    "we can also see that for increasing values of @xmath52 ( and thus @xmath143 ) the quartic term in ( [ vgeff2 ] ) becomes more important and for given @xmath3 solutions ( [ ssol1 ] ) and ( [ ksol ] ) can be replaced by ( [ ssol2 ] ) .",
    "however , unless @xmath145 , this regime occurs rather close to the @xmath138 .",
    "we note that the local minimum disappears for mass scales of the oraifeartaigh sector slightly smaller than @xmath20 this can be understood by noticing that the solution ( [ ssol2 ] ) , which is a good approximation for sufficiently large @xmath74 , can be rewritten as : @xmath146 if the left - hand side of ( [ ssol2 ] ) exceeds unity , our perturbative expansion ( [ eff2a ] ) breaks down and one should not expect the minimum to persist .",
    "it also follows from ( [ ssol22 ] ) that the maximal scale @xmath40 for which there exists a local minimum with @xmath24 scales as @xmath147 , which , upon substitution to ( [ ssol2 ] ) shows that the corresponding value of @xmath4 scales as @xmath148 .",
    "these observations are confirmed by our numerical analysis .",
    "hence our example with @xmath149 is a conservative choice indeed .",
    "we repeated the numerical analysis described above for several randomly generated models with the oraifeartaigh sector consisting from @xmath150 to @xmath151 pairs of fields ( for the details of the randomization procedure , see example ( iv ) in appendix b ) and checked if the metastable minimum disappears for large @xmath74 .",
    "we found that this is the case , indeed ; in each example we had @xmath152 , which shows that the results for the particular example discussed in this section can be applied to a broad class of ort models , including those with broken @xmath9 symmetry , to be discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "this bound can , however , be made weaker by introducing a messenger and/or oraifeartaigh sector with a very large number of fields , so that the one - loop corrections can compete more efficiently with @xmath43-suppressed corrections .",
    "we also note that although the three possibilities discussed above form an exhaustive list for the simple model we have considered , in more general situations one can have @xmath87 and @xmath153 , and to determine the position of the local minimum of the potential ( [ vgeff ] ) or ( [ vgeff2 ] )  if it exists  one has to consider terms of higher powers of @xmath4 .",
    "since in this case one obtains a solution that survives in the limit @xmath19 , we believe that it has similar properties to ( [ ssol1 ] ) .",
    "the numerical analysis supports the conclusion that the supergravity corrections provide an upper bound on the values of the mass scale @xmath74 of the oraifeartaigh sector for which the metastable supersymmetry breaking minima exist . in the particular example analyzed here",
    ", this bound is @xmath154 , which corresponds to @xmath155 .      in this subsection",
    "we would like to extend our discussion to gauge mediation in the presence of moduli or , vice versa , to the impact of messengers on moduli stabilization .",
    "the presence of moduli is a generic future of gravitational sectors rooted in extra - dimensional models .",
    "in fact , ort models , with sm singlets only , have been used as the source of supersymmetry breaking and the uplifting potential in supergravity models with moduli , stabilized by supersymmetric dynamics involving fluxes and nonperturbative superpotentials @xcite . in simple models discussed in the literature",
    ", one assumes that all moduli except one ( let us call it @xmath156 ) are stabilized by fluxes and @xmath156 is stabilized by a nonperturbative superpotential .",
