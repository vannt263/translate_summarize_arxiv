    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the study of the interaction between matter and the electromagnetic field inside a cavity at the quantum level , allows the investigation of a variety of physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "one of these phenomena is the superradiance phase transition that occurs when an ensemble of atom - like emitters and the cavity field interact strongly and form a strongly correlated thermal equilibrium state @xcite .",
    "the superradiance phase transition has been analyzed and debated theoretically for over forty years @xcite , and recent experiments have started to observe evidence of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the superradiant phase is characterized by a strongly correlated atom - cavity state .",
    "when the number of atoms is large , this state would be of the greenberger - horne - zeilinger type , which could serve as a resource for quantum technologies such as precise measurement or clocks .",
    "the recent emergence of superconducting qubits and resonators has enabled circuit - qed systems to access parameter regimes that were inaccessible with other systems @xcite . in particular , the coupling strength of a single qubit to a cavity can now be made comparable to the bare energies of the qubit and the cavity , and unconventional spectra characteristic of the corresponding highly correlated states have been observed in the experiments reported in refs .",
    "another recent experiment coupled thousands of qubits to a single cavity , and the frequency shift of the cavity frequency served as evidence of an ensemble enhancement effect in the coupling between the cavity and the qubit ensemble @xcite .    as a result of the fact that superconducting qubits are in a sense macroscopic artificial atoms",
    ", they have more tunable parameters and larger parameter fluctuations than natural atoms .",
    "this situation allows us to explore novel parameter settings but at the same time requires us to take into consideration the possibly very large parameter fluctuations . as phase transitions are abrupt changes that take place when a combination of system parameters satisfies some condition ,",
    "one question that arises is whether the sharpness of the phase transition is preserved when parameter fluctuations are taken into consideration .",
    "some related question have been discussed recently in the literature @xcite . a recent study investigated possible ways to mitigate the effect of the parameter fluctuations in the time - domain superradiance that occurs when emitters are initially excited and allowed to emit photons into the cavity @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we address the above question in the case of the superradiance phase transition in the dicke model , where a large number of qubits interact with a single cavity .",
    "the model that we study is based on typical superconducting circuit - qed systems , which include the so - called bias term and fluctuations in both the bias term and the qubit gaps .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the basic model and its ground state in the absence of fluctuations , hence introducing some basic ideas of the superradiance phase transition . in sec .",

    "[ sec : allparameterfluctuations ] we include the fluctuations in the bias terms . in sec .",
    "[ sec : finitetemperature ] we consider the effect of thermal fluctuations on the phase transition condition .",
    "after a brief discussion of typical experimental parameters and a possible measurement procedure in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimentalconsiderations ] , we conclude with some final remarks in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us consider a system with @xmath0 qubits coupled to a single harmonic oscillator , and let us ( as a first step ) assume that the qubit parameters are identical .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the qubit gap , @xmath3 is the cavity s characteristic frequency , @xmath4 is the coupling strength between a single qubit and the cavity , the operators @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) are the pauli operators of qubit @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the annihilation and creation operators of the cavity .    in the absence of parameter fluctuations",
    ", it is natural to define the collective spin operators @xmath10 which obey the standard spin commutation relations up to the factor @xmath11 , which we have not included in the definition of @xmath12 , i.e.  @xmath13=i\\varepsilon_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } \\hat{s}_{\\gamma}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the levi - civita tensor .",
    "if we also define the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 the hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath17 if we now take the classical limit , i.e. treat the spin @xmath18 as a continuous variable ( with @xmath19 ) and similarly treat @xmath20 and @xmath21 as classical position and momentum variables , and we look for the ground state of the system by minimizing the hamiltonian , we find that this state obeys the relations @xmath22 combining these equations we obtain @xmath23 for @xmath24 , the above equation has a single solution : @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath26 , the equation has three solutions : @xmath25 which now is a local maximum of the energy and therefore does not correspond to the ground state and @xmath27 or in other words @xmath28    the above derivation describes the quantum phase transition between a normal state and a superradiant state , with the well - known phase transition condition @xmath29 . if we go well above the transition point , we can approximate the above expression for @xmath20 as @xmath30 in the classical case , the @xmath0 small spins that form the large @xmath31 all point in the same direction : along the z axis if the parameters correspond to the normal state or making an angle @xmath32 with the z axis if the parameters correspond to the superradiant state .",
    "well above the transition point , @xmath32 can be approximated as @xmath33 for later convenience we define the angle @xmath34 : @xmath35 this angle is equal to @xmath36 in the normal phase and approaches zero when we go deep into the superradiant phase .",
    "we can now take the above results and infer from them the quantum mechanical ground state .",
    "a key point here is to include not only one of the two classical solutions , but rather a coherent superposition of the two :    @xmath37 , \\label{eq : manyqubitsuperradiantgroundstate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is given by the positive solution in eq .",

    "we have assumed above that all the qubits have the same values of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "we now ask what effect one can expect if one includes fluctuations in these parameters . in particular , would one still have the phase transition , or would it be smeared out ?",
    "equation ( [ eq : manyqubitsuperradiantgroundstate ] ) is very instructive in this context .",
    "it shows that if we focus on one branch in the superposition , then each subsystem ( i.e. the oscillator or each one of the qubits ) is in the ground state that corresponds to its own hamiltonian plus a mean - field contribution from the other subsystems with which it interacts . in particular , the bias term of each qubit has a mean - field contribution from the finite average value of the cavity field , while the cavity feels a mean - field force that is the sum of many small contributions from all the qubits .",
    "there is no reason to believe that fluctuations in @xmath2 and @xmath4 will modify this picture .",
    "the ground state can therefore be well approximated at the mean - field level .",
    "careful analysis of quantum fluctuations leads to the same conslusion @xcite .",
    "we can therefore take the hamiltonian @xmath40 and follow a similar procedure as the one we used in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] to find the ground state under the classical approximation .",
    "in particular , we write the oscillator hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 variables .",
    "it is not very useful to define the collective spin operator here .",
    "but we can instead proceed by considering the expectation values of the individual spins and use these as the classical values of the spins .",
    "the ground state is described by the expectation values : @xmath41 combining these equations we find that in the ground state @xmath42    since at the phase transition point @xmath25 , the condition for the phase transition is given by @xmath43 in other words , when the left - hand side is smaller than one the system is in the normal phase , and when the left - hand side is larger than one the system is in the superradiant phase . in the superradiant phase , the ground state has the same form as eq .",

    "let us now include fluctuations in @xmath46 .",
    "the hamiltonian is now given by    @xmath47    as above , the semi - classical ground state is described by the expectation values : @xmath48 combining these equations gives @xmath49    now we have a finite value of @xmath20 even for small values of @xmath4 , especially if the average value of @xmath46 is not equal to zero , because the qubits ( which are now generally biased away from the symmetry point ) give rise to a finite force felt by the cavity , shifting its equilibrium point .",

    "a small value of @xmath44 ( which corresponds to large fluctuations in @xmath51 ) leads to the conclusion that larger values of @xmath58 are required in order to satisfy the superradiance phase transition condition .",

    "typical parameters for superconducting circuit - qed setups are : @xmath885 ghz , @xmath8910 - 100 mhz .",
    "these parameters give @xmath90 0.002 - 0.2 .",
    "one therefore needs @xmath91 10 - 1000 in order to achieve the superradiance phase transition , even in the absence of parameter fluctuations .",
    "in particular , the recent experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite had @xmath8915 mhz and @xmath92 .",
    "these parameters are therefore comparable to what is needed to realize the phase transition in the absence of fluctuations . as we showed above , it is mainly fluctuations in @xmath46 that push the transition point towards higher values of @xmath4 and/or @xmath0 .",
    "these fluctuations are typically on the order of 100 mhz , which is much smaller than @xmath2 and should not lead to a dramatic increase in the required value of @xmath93 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitetemperature ] , if we consider a value of @xmath94 between 1 and 2 , the critical temperature is on the order of @xmath95 and it decreases gradually to zero as @xmath64 increases and becomes comparable to 1 .",
    "achieving such temperatures in superconducting circuits is not very challenging , even though temperatures can not go much lower than @xmath95 .",
    "the transition between the normal and superradiant states is usually studied by treating the coupling strength as a tunable parameter , with the superradiant state becoming the thermal - equilibrium state for sufficiently strong coupling .",
    "if the coupling strength is tunable in a given experimental setup , one could vary it and measure the smallest frequency appearing in the absorption or transmission spectrum of the system .",
    "this frequency shrinks to zero at the transition point , which is a feature that can be used as a signature of the phase transition .",
    "it is common in superconducting circuits that the coupling strength is not tunable . even in this case , where measuring the smallest excitation frequency would not allow one to identify the state of the system , the full spectrum will generally allow a determination of the state @xcite .",
    "another possible technique for distinguishing between the two phases relies on the fact that in the superradiant state the oscillator will be equally likely to be in two different coherent states . by suddenly shifting the qubit bias points away from their symmetry points and performing quantum state tomography",
    "one would be able to infer the state of the system ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "for reliable tomography results , this procedure would have to be performed within the coherence time that includes all decoherence process , i.e.  the inverse of the sum of all the dephasing rates , which becomes experimentally challenging for a large number of qubits . even if one can not achieve the difficult task of many qubit quantum state tomography",
    ", one could distinguish beteen the normal and superradiant phases by performing the sudden shift of the qubit bias points and measuring only the state of the oscillator ( many times ) .",
    "this way one can deduce whether the oscillator was always in the same state or in one of two different states .",
    "hence , this protocol can allow the identification of the bistable regime that corresponds to the superradiant phase .",
    "this procedure does not reveal whether the qubits and the oscillator were entangled or they were in one of two correlated but unentangled states .",
    "however , since it relies on distinguishing between two coherent states in the oscillator , the only limiting factor for the measurement time is the oscillator s relaxation time .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of various combinations of parameter fluctuations on the superradiance quantum phase transition .",
    "our results show that the phase transition is robust against these parameter fluctuations .",
    "bias point fluctuations , which constitute one of the main limitations to coherence in superconducting qubit , have the most serious effect on the superradiance phase transition , because they can significantly increase the coupling strength required to enter the superradiant state .",
    "nevertheless , a quantum phase transition is still expected to occur even in this case .",
