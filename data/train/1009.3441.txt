    "in recent years , the effort to give a physical explanation to the today observed cosmic acceleration @xcite has attracted a good amount of interest in fourth order gravity ( fog ) considered as a viable mechanism to explain the cosmic acceleration by extending the geometric sector of field equations without the introduction of dark matter and dark energy . at fundamental level",
    ", several efforts have been aimed towards the unification of gravity with the other interactions of physics , like electromagnetism , assuming gr as the only fundamental theory capable of explaining the gravitational interaction .",
    "the failure of such attempts led to the common belief that gr had to be revised in the ultraviolet limit in order to address issues like quantization and renormalization .",
    "these are only some aspects of the several physical and mathematical motivations to enlarge gr to more general approaches . for comprehensive reviews of the problem ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "other issues come from astrophysics .",
    "for example , the observed pioneer anomaly problem @xcite can be framed into the same approach @xcite and then , apart the cosmology and quantum field theory , a systematic analysis of such theories urges at small , medium and large scales . in particular , a delicate point is to address the weak field limit of any extended theory of gravity since two main issues are extremely relevant : @xmath2 preserving the results of gr al local scales since they well fit solar system experiments and observations ; @xmath3 enclosing in a self - consistent and comprehensive picture phenomena as anomalous acceleration or dark matter at galactic scales .",
    "it is straightforward to extend gr to theories with additional geometric degrees of freedom and several recent proposals focused on the old idea of modifying the gravitational lagrangian in a purely metric framework , leading to fourth - order and higher - order field equations @xcite .",
    "such an approach has become a sort of paradigm in the study of gravitational interaction consisting , essentially , _ in adding higher order curvature invariants and minimally or non - minimally coupled scalar fields into dynamics which come out from the effective action of some unification or quantum gravity theory_.    the idea to extend einstein s theory of gravitation is fruitful and economic also with respect to several attempts which try to solve problems by adding new and , most of times , unjustified ingredients in order to give self - consistent pictures of dynamics .",
    "the today observed accelerated expansion of the hubble flow and the missing matter at astrophysical scales are primarily enclosed in these considerations .",
    "both the issues could be solved by changing the gravitational sector , _",
    "i.e. _ the _ l.h.s .",
    "_ of field equations .",
    "the philosophy is alternative to add new cosmic fluids ( new components in the _",
    "_ of field equations ) which should give rise to clustered structures ( dark matter ) or to accelerated dynamics ( dark energy ) thanks to exotic equations of state .",
    "in particular , relaxing the hypothesis that gravitational lagrangian has to be a linear function of the ricci curvature scalar @xmath0 , like in the hilbert - einstein formulation , one can take into account an effective action where the gravitational lagrangian includes other scalar invariants .    due to the increased complexity of the field equations , the main body of theoretical works dealt with the effort to achieve some formally equivalent theories which could be handled in a simpler way . in this sense",
    ", a reduction of the differential order of the field equations can be achieved by considering metric and connection as independent objects in the so called _ palatini approach _ @xcite and energy conditions have to be carefully discussed @xcite .",
    "in addition , other authors exploited the formal relations to scalar - tensor theories to make some statements about the weak field regime @xcite , which was already worked out for scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "also a post - newtonian parameterization with metric approach in the jordan frame has been considered @xcite .    in this review paper , we want to address the general problem of the weak field limit for theories of gravity where higher order curvature invariants are present . in particular , we deal with theories where riemann tensor , ricci tensor , and ricci scalar are considered in the effective action .",
    "we deduce the field equations , discuss the weak field limit and derive the weak field potentials with corrections to the newtonian potential .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following :    in _ section _ [ gr ] , we provide a short summary of gr and discuss its extension to fog . besides we take into account the conformal transformations showing how such theories can be discussed under the standard of scalar - tensor gravity .    in _ section _ [ perturb ] ,",
    "we give generalities on spherically symmetric , birkhoff theorem , eddington parameters and deviations from gr solutions . a general perturbation approach for @xmath1-gravity",
    "is discussed starting from gr .",
    "_ section _ [ ppn - paradigm ] is devoted to the technical development of field equations with respect to newtonian and post - newtonian approaches .    in _ section _ [ ts ]",
    "we take into account the debate on the analogy between @xmath1- gravity and scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "we show that @xmath1-models are dynamically equivalent to ohanlon models which is a special case of scalar - tensor gravity characterized by a self - interaction potential without a kinetic term .",
    "we show that comparing the results of this theory with gr , in the weak field limit , could lead to misleading conclusions .    in _ section _ [ newtlimstandard ]",
    ", we analyze the newtonian limit of @xmath1-gravity .",
    "we are going to focus exclusively on the weak field limit within the metric approach . by using the development for a generic analytic function @xmath1",
    ", we find the solution in the vacuum with standard coordinates .",
    "besides , we show that the birkhoff theorem is not a general result for @xmath1-gravity since time - dependent evolution for spherically symmetric solutions can be achieved according to the order of perturbation . in other words ,",
    "solutions could not be stable as requested by the birkhoff theorem .    in _ section _ [ postnewtlimisitropic ] ,",
    "we report the newtonian and post - newtonian limit of field equations by using the green function method for @xmath1-gravity and the formal solutions in the harmonic gauge . a general discussion about the mathematical properties of equations , the solutions and their deviations with respect to gauss and birkhoff theorem , and the minkowskian behavior of metric tensor are reported .",
    "we derive the general solutions ( at newtonian and post - newtonian levels ) when an uniform massive spherical source is considered .",
    "the point - like source limit of the newtonian solution is discussed and the compatibility of @xmath1-gravity with respect to gr is shown .    in _ section _ [ newtlimitquadr ] , we discuss the newtonian limit but for a _ quadratic gravity lagrangian _ where quadratic curvature invariants are presents . also in this case , we adopt the green function method .",
    "we find the internal and external potential generated by an extended spherically symmetric matter source .",
    "a particularly detailed discussion about the field equations and their solutions is provided for a set of values of the arbitrary constants present in the model .    in section [ fxyzgravity ]",
    "the newtonian limit of the most general fog is discussed with no gauge condition . the most general theory with fourth order differential equations is obtained by generalizing the @xmath1-models in the action with a generic function containing the other two curvature invariants : _ ricci square _",
    "( @xmath4 ) and _ riemann square _ ( @xmath5 ) . considering the gauss - bonnet invariant , it is possible to show that only two of these invariants are really necessary .",
    "in section [ conclus ] , we draw the conclusions and discuss the possible applications of the results .",
    "any relativistic theory of gravity has to match some minimal requirements to address gravitational dynamics .",
    "first of all , it has to explain issues coming from celestial mechanics as the planetary orbits , the potential of self - gravitating systems , the solar system stability .",
    "this means that it has to reproduce the newtonian dynamics in the weak field limit and then it has to pass the solar system experiments which are all well founded and constitute the test bed of gr @xcite .",
    "besides , any theory of gravity has to be consistent with stellar structures and galactic dynamics considering the observed baryonic constituents ( e.g. luminous components as stars , sub - luminous components as planets , dust and gas ) , radiation and newtonian potential which is , by assumption , extrapolated to galactic scales .",
    "the third step is cosmology and large scale structure which means to reproduce , in a self - consistent way , the cosmological parameters as the expansion rate , the hubble constant , the density parameter and the clustering of galaxies .",
    "observations probe the standard baryonic matter , the radiation and an attractive overall interaction , acting at all scales and depending on distance . from a phenomenological point of view this is _ gravity_.    gr is the simplest theory which partially satisfies the above requirements @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that space and time are entangled into a single spacetime structure , which , in the limit of no gravitational forces , has to reproduce the minkowski spacetime . besides , the universe is assumed to be a curved manifold and the curvature depends on mass - energy distribution @xcite .",
    "in other words , the distribution of matter influences point by point the local curvature of the spacetime structure .    furthermore , gr is based on three first principles that are _ relativity _ , _ equivalence _ , and _",
    "general covariance_(see @xcite for detailed discussions ) .",
    "another requirement is the _ principle of causality _ that means that each point of spacetime admits a notion of past , present and future .",
    "let us also recall that the newtonian theory , the weak field limit of gr , requires absolute concepts of space and time , that particles move in a preferred inertial frame following curved trajectories function of the sources ( _ i.e. _ , the `` forces '' ) .    on these bases",
    ", gr postulates that gravitational forces have to be expressed by the curvature of a metric tensor field @xmath6 on a four - dimensional spacetime manifold , having the same signature of minkowski metric , here assumed to be @xmath7 .",
    "curvature is locally determined by the distribution of the sources , that is , being the spacetime a continuum , it is possible to define a stress - energy tensor @xmath8 which is the source of the curvature .",
    "once a metric @xmath9 is given , the inverse @xmath10 satisfies the condition and @xmath11 ; the latin index between @xmath12 and @xmath11 . ]",
    "@xmath13    its curvature is expressed by the _ riemann tensor _ ( curvature )    @xmath14    where the comas are partial derivatives .",
    "the @xmath15 are the christoffel symbols given by    @xmath16    if the levi - civita connection is assumed .",
    "the contraction of the riemann tensor ( [ rienmanntensor ] )    @xmath17    is the _",
    "ricci tensor _ and the scalar    @xmath18    is called the _ scalar curvature _ of @xmath9 .",
    "the riemann tensor ( [ rienmanntensor ] ) satisfies the so - called _",
    "bianchi identities _ and the _ contracted bianchi identities _",
    ", that is    @xmath19    where the covariant derivative is @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the dalembert operator with respect to the metric @xmath9 ( see for the details @xcite ) .    assuming that matter is given as a perfect fluid , that is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 defines a comoving observer ( with the conditions @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and we are assuming natural units with @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the pressure and @xmath29 the mass - energy density of the fluid , then the continuity equation requires @xmath8 to be covariantly constant , _",
    "i.e. _ it has to satisfy the conservation law    @xmath30    that are nothing else but contracted bianchi identities .",
    "the gr field equations are then    @xmath31    where    @xmath32    is the `` _ _ einstein tensor _ _ '' of @xmath9 .",
    "these equations are both variational and satisfy the conservation laws ( [ conservationlaw ] ) since the following relation holds    @xmath33    as a byproduct of the above bianchi identities @xcite .",
    "the hilbert - einstein lagrangian that allows to obtain the field equations ( [ fieldequationgr ] ) is the sum of an ordinary _ matter lagrangian _",
    "@xmath34 ( minimally coupled ) and of the ricci scalar :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 denotes the square root of the value of the determinant of the metric @xmath9 and the coupling constant is @xmath37 . the action of gr is    @xmath38    from the action principle , we get the field equations ( [ fieldequationgr ] ) by the variation :    @xmath39\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}+\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-g}g^{\\mu\\nu}\\delta r_{\\mu\\nu}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is energy momentum tensor of matter    @xmath40    the last term in ( [ variationprinciplegr ] ) is a 4-divergence    @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    then we can neglect it and we get the field equation ( [ fieldequationgr ] ) . for the variational calculus ( [ variationprinciplegr ] ) , the following relations can be used    @xmath42    the choice by hilbert and einstein was completely arbitrary but it was the simplest one both from the mathematical and the physical viewpoint . as it was later clarified by levi - civita curvature is not a `` purely metric notion '' but , rather , a notion related to the `` linear connection '' to which `` parallel transport '' and `` covariant derivation '' refer @xcite .",
    "this is the precursor idea of the `` gauge theoretical framework '' @xcite , defined after the pioneering work by cartan @xcite .",
    "it was later clarified that the principles of relativity , equivalence , covariance , and causality , just require that the spacetime structure has to be determined by either one or both of two fields , a lorentzian metric @xmath43 and a linear connection @xmath44 , assumed to be torsionless for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the metric @xmath43 fixes the causal structure of spacetime ( the light cones ) as well as its metric relations ( clocks and rods ) ; the connection @xmath44 fixes the free - fall , _ i.e. _ the locally inertial observers .",
    "they have , of course , to satisfy a number of compatibility relations which amount to require that photons follow the null geodesics of @xmath44 , so that @xmath44 and @xmath43 can be independent , _ a priori _ , but constrained , _ a posteriori _ , by some physical restrictions .",
    "these , however , do not impose that @xmath44 has necessarily to be the levi - civita connection of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this achievement justifies the fact , at least in principle , `` _ _ extended theories of gravity _ _ '' can be considered starting from the same points by einstein and hilbert : they are theories in which gravitation is described by either a metric ( the so - called `` purely metric theories '' ) , or by a linear connection ( the so - called `` purely affine theories '' ) or by both fields ( the so - called `` metric - affine theories '' , also known as `` first order formalism theories '' ) . in these theories ,",
    "the lagrangian is a scalar density of the curvature invariants constructed out of both @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the choice ( [ helagrangian ] ) is by no means unique and it turns out that the hilbert - einstein lagrangian is in fact the only choice that produces an invariant that is linear in second derivatives of the metric ( or first derivatives of the connection ) .",
    "a lagrangian that , unfortunately , is rather singular from the hamiltonian viewpoint , in much than same way as lagrangians , linear in canonical momenta , are rather singular in classical mechanics ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "a number of attempts to generalize gr ( and unify it to electromagnetism ) along these lines were followed by einstein himself and many others ( eddington , weyl , schrodinger , just to quote the main contributors ; see , _ e.g.",
    "_ , @xcite ) but they were given up because of a number of difficulties related to the complicated structure of a non - linear theory ( where by `` non - linear '' we mean here a theory that is based on non - linear invariants of the curvature tensor ) , and also because of the new understanding of physics that is currently based on four fundamental forces and requires a general `` gauge framework '' to be adopted ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further curvature invariants or non - linear functions of them should be also considered , especially in view of the fact that they have to be included in both the semi - classical expansion of any quantum lagrangian or in the low - energy limit of a string lagrangian .",
    "moreover , it is clear from the recent astrophysical observations that einstein equations are no longer a good test for gravitation at all scales , that is at solar system , galactic , extra - galactic and cosmic scales , unless one does not admit that the _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of eqs.([fieldequationgr ] ) contains some kind of exotic matter - energy density which are generically addressed as the `` dark matter '' and `` dark energy '' .    from our point of view",
    ", the philosophy of extended theories of gravity is much simpler @xcite . instead of changing the matter side of einstein equations ( [ fieldequationgr ] ) in order to fit the `` missing matter - energy '' content of the currently observed universe by adding new forms of matter and energy , we assume that it is more convenient to change the gravitational side of the equations , admitting corrections coming from non - linear lagrangians .",
    "however such an approach should be explored .",
    "of course , the lagrangians should be conveniently tuned up on the basis of their best fit with all possible observational tests , at infrared scales ( solar , galactic , extragalactic and cosmic ) and on the basis of consistency with fundamental theories at ultraviolet scales .",
    "let us take into account an important class of extended theories of gravity , the fourth order gravity .",
    "it is the first straightforward generalization of gr and can be directly related to the ultraviolet ( quantum gravity ) and infrared ( cosmology ) issues of any final comprehensive theory of gravity .",
    "let us start with the general class of _ fourth order gravity _",

    "the calculations have been essentially developed in the so - called jordan frame but we have also considered the conformal transformations and the possible shortcomings emerging in carrying the weak field limit results in the einstein frame without an appropriate interpretation of post - newtonian parameters .",
    "the general feature that emerges from the weak field limit is that corrections to the newtonian potential naturally come out .",
    "these corrections are yukawa - like terms bringing characteristic masses and lengths .",
    "conversely , the standard newtonian potential is just a feature emerging in the particular case @xmath205 .",
    "these characteristic masses ( and lengths ) come out as combinations of the parameters of the theory and fix the scales where corrections become relevant .",
    "these results open new intriguing possibilities since accurate measurements of ppn parameters could confirm or rule out these theories in view of the forthcoming space experiments as gaia and game ( see @xcite for a detailed review of the status of art ) .",

    "the fact that such `` dark '' structures have not been definitely discovered at fundamental quantum scales but operate at large astrophysical ( infra - red scales ) could be due to these corrections to the newtonian potential which can be hardly detected at laboratory or solar system scales .",

    "<S> accelerating behavior of cosmic fluid , large scale structure , potential of galaxy clusters , rotation curves of spiral galaxies could be reproduced by means of extending general relativity to generic actions containing higher order and non - minimally coupled terms in curvature invariants . in other words , gravity could act in different ways at different scales and the above `` shortcomings '' could be due to the incorrect extrapolations of the einstein theory , actually tested at short scales and low energy regimes . </S>",
