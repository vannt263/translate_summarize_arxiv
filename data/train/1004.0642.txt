    "using present data - acquisition methods , it has become possible to build enormous databases in practically all fields of science .",
    "the large size of these databases make their analysis rather intricate , but questions can now be posed which were previously unanswerable . in particular , quantitative studies of extreme events have become feasible .",
    "accordingly , extreme value statistics ( evs ) has found its way from mathematics @xcite to various disciplines , foremost among them those fields where the extremes involve great risks as in engineering@xcite , finance @xcite , hydrology @xcite , meteorology @xcite , geology @xcite . in physics ,",
    "extreme statistics was relatively dormant until the last decade when a number of studies appeared in relation to spin glasses @xcite , interface and landscape  fluctuations @xcite , random fragmentation @xcite , level - density in ideal quantum gases @xcite , atmospheric time series @xcite , etc .",
    "the above studies revealed that an important problem with the quantitative application of evs is the slow convergence in the size @xmath0 of the data set whose extremum is sought .",
    "a well known example is that the fisher - tippett - gumbel limit distribution for independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d .",
    ") variables is typically approached logarithmically slowly , i.e. proportionally to @xmath1 .",
    "this convergence problem is not cured even by the present size of the databases , thus studies of finite - size corrections are needed for a thorough analysis of evs . while the mathematical literature contains results on the rate of convergence to the universal limit distributions @xcite , and particular cases for correlated variables have also been studied in physics @xcite , to our knowledge , finite - size effects have apparently been ignored in most empirical data analysis .    in order to develop a readily usable theory of finite - size corrections giving not only the amplitude of the corrections but also providing shape corrections to the limit distribution",
    ", we recently introduced a renormalization group ( rg ) approach for the case of i.i.d .",
    "variables @xcite .",
    "the concept of using rg in probability theory has been pioneered by jona - lasinio @xcite in connection with critical phenomena . in the context of evs ,",
    "the real - space rg methods have been applied to random landscapes @xcite . in our case , it turned out that the rg equation is just a physicist s reformulation and a simple generalization of the original fixed point equation of fisher and tippett @xcite . within this approach , the fixed point condition yields the known one - parameter ( @xmath2 ) family of solutions which provides the traditional classification of evs limit distributions ( fisher - tippett - gumbel , -frchet , -weibull ) .",
    "the rg approach is instrumental in determining the finite - size corrections as well , since they emerge from the action of the rg on the neighborhood of the fixed point .",
    "we found that the resulting eigenvalue problem and the emerging eigenfunctions represent the generic leading finite - size correction functions .",
    "an important outcome of the general considerations is that the first order shape corrections display universality .",
    "namely , within a class of limit distributions characterized by @xmath2 , the correction is determined by a single additional parameter @xmath3 . the @xmath2 is long known to be related to the leading asymptote of the parent distribution , while @xmath4 , emerging as an eigenvalue index from rg , is determined by the next - to - leading asymptote of the parent distribution which is in accordance with the mathematical results @xcite .",
    "note that our rg framework also provides a simple example in addition to a series of known exact rg schemes @xcite .",
    "the above rg picture and the corresponding results have been briefly presented in a recent letter @xcite . here , we offer an extended and more detailed view on our work with new aspects relating to the nonlinear neighborhood of the fixed line including nonlinear manifolds .",
    "in particular , a detailed derivation of the rg picture is presented in sec .",
    "[ s : iid - fp ] where the fixed line of the rg transformation , parametrized by @xmath2 , is linked to the evs limit distributions .",
    "next , linear perturbations around a point on the fixed line are considered .",
    "the eigenvalue problem is solved ( sec .",
    "[ s : iid - lin ] ) , giving rise to a new parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the general aspects of the theory are developed further in sec .",
    "[ s : iid - nlrg ] where the rg transformation beyond the linear neighborhood of the fixed point is formulated to treat the case of marginal eigenfunctions within the fisher - tippett - gumbel class .",
    "the practical consequences are discussed by connecting to the finite size properties in typical evs problems and showing that the parameter @xmath3 is the finite - size scaling exponent ( sec .",
    "[ s : iid - lin - sd ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the relationship between @xmath3 and the parent distributions is determined , and we analyze in detail a family of parents with generalized exponential asymptote frequently occuring in applications .",
    "the question of unstable perturbations and the invariant manifolds associated with them are examined in sec .",
    "[ s : iid - unst ] , and they are illustrated on a series of examples . finally , the conclusion and possible avenues for further application of the rg scheme to evs problems are found in sec .",
    "[ s : end ] .",
    "in this section we recuperate known basic properties of evs and explain the emergence of limit distributions within the framework of rg theory .",
    "this is essentially a reformulation of the original proposition of the seminal work by fisher and tippett @xcite , which we will further develop in subsequent sections .",
    "the basic question of evs is the limit behavior of the distribution of extremal values of random variables . in what follows",
    "we shall restrict our attention to maxima , i.e. , the distribution of the largest variable , but by a sign change this is equivalent to the problem of minima .",
    "suppose that we have a `` batch '' of random variables @xmath5 , and we ask about the statistical properties of the largest @xmath6 .",
    "the question has a simple answer , if the original variables @xmath7 were independent , identically distributed , each according to the so called parent probability density @xmath8 .",
    "the simplicity is apparent when using the integrated ( cumulative ) distribution @xmath9 i.e. the probability that the variable is not larger than @xmath10 ( we assume here and later nonsingular densities , and differentiability if necessary ) .",
    "then the probability that the maximum is not exceeding @xmath10 is given by the joint probability that all variables do not exceed @xmath10 , hence the integrated distribution of the maximum of batch of @xmath0 variables , the extreme value distribution ( evd ) is @xmath11    since the integrated parent distribution @xmath12 is less than one whenever @xmath10 is within the support of the parent , the above quantity will converge to zero there for any fixed @xmath10 .",
    "however , we can ask whether there is a linear change of variable so that for large @xmath0 the evd is restored to a nondegenerate function in the large @xmath0 limit . specifically , we ask about the existence of parameters @xmath13 such that @xmath14 where the resulting integrated distribution represents the extreme value limit distribution .",
    "it is related to the limit density as @xmath15 .",
    "note that the parameters @xmath13 are not unique , if one choice produces a nondegenerate limit evd then adding constants to either will also yield another one .",
    "this ambiguity can be eliminated by a standardization convention , for example @xmath16 we can require this condition also at finite stages in the limit for the maximum distribution @xmath17 , which specifies uniquely the parameters @xmath13 .",
    "now let us turn to the invariance condition , which follows from the fact that @xmath18 is a limit distribution of evs .",
    "the reason behind this invariance is that if @xmath19 variables come from a parent that is a limit evd , then their maximum will be also distributed according to the same limit evd .",
    "indeed , conceiving each of the variables as themselves representing maxima of some other large collection of variables , the distribution of their overall maximum will obviously be again the same limit evd .",
    "since these statements are valid up to a linear change of variable , for the limit evd we obtain @xmath20 with appropriate scale- and shift paramenters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . while here @xmath19 should be a positive integer , we can easily convince ourselves that it can be any positive rational .",
    "indeed , considering another @xmath23 , where @xmath19 is fixed during the large size limit , and making use of @xmath24 we obtain by ( [ eq : mn - def],[eq : mn - limit ] ) again .",
    "then @xmath19 can in fact be continued to positive real numbers .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 in should be consistent with the standardization . in sum , condition should be understood such that if @xmath18 is a limit distribution then it should solve for any @xmath19 with parameters ensuring .",
    "this is known in the mathematical literature as the condition of max - stability , appearing first in the classic paper by fisher and tippett @xcite and now an exercise in textbooks on evs .",
    "in order to go later beyond the invariance condition , following our short paper @xcite , we will identify the rg transformation of an integrated distribution @xmath26 by the following operation @xmath27(x ) & =   \\mu^p(a(p)x+b(p)).\\label{eq : def - rg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can easily see that the standardization of the type for @xmath28(x)$ ] requires    @xmath29    [ eq : stand ]    a condition forming part of the rg operation .",
    "note that traditional rg used in critical phenomena is in fact a semigroup since , due to the elimination of degrees of freedom , the inverse element is missing . in our case , however , the transformations form a group , as the inverse element of a transformation with parameter @xmath19 has parameter @xmath30 .",
    "obviously , @xmath31 corresponds to the decrease of the batch size , but the above rg transformation is still meaningful .    we should note that , although there are differences , the evs version of the rg transformation [ eqs.([eq : def - rg],[eq : stand ] ) ] has the spirit of the traditional rg .",
    "namely , the raising to power @xmath32 and shifting by @xmath22 decreases the weight of the small argument part of the parent distribution ( eliminating the irrelevant degrees of freedom ) , while rescaling by @xmath21 is analogous to the rescaling of the remaining degrees of freedom .    within rg theory , the invariance condition becomes a fixed point relation @xmath33(x ) =   m(x).\\label{eq : rgfp}\\ ] ] concerning terminology , we mention that while in mathematical texts max - stability is essentially the fixed point relation , in the rg framework stability is characterized by the response to small deviations from the fixed point , to be investigated later in the paper .",
    "one can easily solve by introducing the function @xmath34 as @xmath35 where standardization requires @xmath36 furthermore , from the parameters can be written in terms of @xmath37 as    @xmath38    [ eq : stand0 ]    the equation for @xmath37 can be obtained from ( [ eq : rgfp ] ) , that is , writing as @xmath39 whence @xmath40 it follows that the sought solution for @xmath41 , independent of @xmath19 , is the reciprocal of a linear function .",
    "the only form consistent with ( [ eq : f - norm ] ) allows one free parameter , @xmath2 , yielding @xmath42 where here and later @xmath43 means differentiation by @xmath44 , and @xmath45 should hold . again using ( [ eq : f - norm ] )",
    "we get by integration the one - parameter family @xmath46 and requires    @xmath47    [ eq : fp - fab2 ]    equation ( [ eq : fp - fab1 ] ) gives with ( [ eq : m - f ] ) the well known generalized extreme value distribution and the respective density    @xmath48    [ eq : gev ]    with support extending to the range @xmath49 .",
    "this one - parameter family constitutes a fixed line of the rg transformation .",
    "the cases @xmath50 were studied separately already by fisher and tippett @xcite , and correspond to the traditional categorization into weibull , gumbel , and frchet universality classes , respectively .",
    "the @xmath51 case gives the limit distribution of integrated parent distributions approaching @xmath52 like a power @xmath53 at a finite upper border , @xmath54 corresponds to faster than power asymptote at either a finite limit or at infinity , and @xmath55 represents parent distributions approaching @xmath52 at infinity with a power @xmath53 .",
    "these three cases will be referred to by the abbreviations ftw , ftg , and ftf , respectively .",
    "while the above fixed point condition is a textbook example of deriving the limit distributions of evs , its perturbation has not been studied . nevertheless , such perturbations are important since they naturally give rise to finite - size corrections . before elucidating the connection to finite - size scaling ,",
    "let us consider the function space about the fixed point and its transformations under the rg operation represented by the right - hand - side of ( [ eq : fp - m ] ) .",
    "introduce the perturbed distribution function @xmath56 where @xmath57 is assumed to satisfy the fixed point condition .",
    "we insert the perturbation into the argument since this leads to a simpler formulation later .",
    "alternatively , one can also define @xmath58 the two formulas are equivalent to linear order in @xmath59 . on the other hand , for a given finite @xmath59 the monotonicity condition for",
    "the integrated distribution @xmath60 in @xmath44 may impose different restrictions on @xmath61 .",
    "generically , both formulas can be understood as approximations for small @xmath59 of some distribution with general @xmath59 dependence , sufficient for the present purposes . if we consider finite perturbations , that will be explicitly stated and the monotonicity condition discussed .",
    "the standardization condition of the type for both of the above integrated distribution functions is satisfied by @xmath62 the third condition sets the sign and scale of @xmath59 , the minus sign is just a convention which will be justified later .",
    "note that in our short communication @xcite we used @xmath63 , so in comparisons a sign change should be understood .",
    "now we shall study the eigenvalue problem of the linearized rg transformation around the fixed point , specifically , when the rg transformation changes the magnitude of the perturbation while leaving its functional form invariant .",
    "in other words , we are seeking the linear part of the invariant manifold of the rg emanating from the fixed point .    to make notation simpler in this section",
    ", we often omit the @xmath2 and @xmath19 arguments , when they are obviously implied , e.g. , we use @xmath64 for @xmath60 , etc .",
    "we start out from , apply the rg transformation , and assume that the result is of the same functional form with only the perturbation parameter changing @xmath65(x)= m^p(a(\\epsilon ) x+b(\\epsilon);\\epsilon)=m(x;\\epsilon ' ) , \\label{eq : rg - lin}\\ ] ] where linearization in @xmath59 and @xmath66 is understood .",
    "the transformation parameters are also expanded    @xmath67    with the zeroth order values @xmath68 taken from ( [ eq : fp - fab2 ] ) and the first order corrections @xmath69 to be determined from the standardization condition with @xmath70 . using and ( [ eq : m - f ] ) in these conditions we straightforwardly get    @xmath71    [ eq : stand1 ]    what is left is to determine the possible values of @xmath66 and the associated invariant function @xmath61 .",
    "we now use ( [ eq : fp - fab1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m - f ] ) , expand to linear order in @xmath59 and @xmath66 in the second exponential , and introduce their ratio as eigenvalue @xmath72 then we obtain @xmath73 we used to obtain the second line , which makes it obvious that the r^ ole of the constants @xmath74 is to ensure the first two conditions in .    by differentiation",
    "we can eliminate the linear part @xmath75 we remind the reader that @xmath68 are given in ( [ eq : fp - fab2 ] ) and change continuously with @xmath19 , furthermore , we recall that @xmath76 thus the @xmath19 independent solution is @xmath77 where the coefficient @xmath78 follows from the third condition in , and the eigenvalue is obtained as @xmath79 where we also used .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 labels the eigenfunctions , but it is more convenient to introduce @xmath81 , which gives @xmath82 linear stability of the fixed point for @xmath32 means that @xmath83 , then @xmath84 , the marginal case is @xmath85 , while @xmath86 characterizes unstable directions .",
    "the eigenfunction is obtained by integrating eq.([psi ] ) while satisfying the conditions ( [ eq : psi ] ) @xmath87 note that for @xmath88 ( [ eq : psi - rg ] ) simplifies to @xmath89 irrespective of the value of @xmath2 .",
    "a function equivalent to ( [ eq : psi - rg ] ) has been found in @xcite when studying convergence to the limit distribution , after starting out with parent distributions in the appropriate domain of attraction .",
    "knowing @xmath90 , a substitution in ( [ eq : stand1 ] ) yields the corrections to the parameters as    @xmath91    summing up this section , we found using the rg theory that , for each fixed point specified by a @xmath2 , the linearized rg transformation yields a one - parameter family of eigenfunctions @xmath92 .",
    "the rle of the index @xmath4 will be elucidated below in sec.[s : iid - lin - sd ] .",
    "we can immediately surmise that marginal eigenfunctions should appear on the line of fixed points @xmath93 .",
    "since two fixed point functions stay the same upon the action of the rg transformation , their difference is also invariant with respect to the rg . if , in particular , the difference function was small , i.e. , the two fixed points were differing by an infinitesimal increment in @xmath2 , then the difference function can be considered as a linear perturbation about either fixed point and , based on its invariance upon the rg , it should be proportional to the marginal eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath94 . by this",
    "implies @xmath95 , whence we conclude that @xmath96 should emerge as an eigenfunction .",
    "the above reasoning is confirmed by a simple calculation .",
    "first we display the marginal eigenfunction from @xmath97 .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{eq : psi - marg}\\ ] ] on the other hand , let us invoke the fixed point distribution and expand to leading order in @xmath98 about some nearby @xmath99 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath100 with the definition , so finally we obtain for the perturbed fixed point    @xmath101    [ eq : evd - marginal ]    a comparison with shows that indeed the difference of two infinitesimally close fixed point distributions is given by the marginal eigenfunction .",
    "this is interesting also from the viewpoint that one can determine the marginal function without solving the eigenvalue problem , by differentiation in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "presumably for non - marginal functions it remains necessary to consider the traditional eigenvalue equation .",
    "as a side - remark , the scale and sign of the eigenfunctions were defined by the requirement .",
    "this had the consequence that the perturbation formula has as small parameter @xmath59 just the increment in @xmath2 .",
    "any other convention for the curvature at the origin in would have introduced an extra factor in the perturbation in , so the prescription indeed provides the most natural scale and sign of the eigenfunctions .",
    "here we shall deal with the situation when @xmath95 , i.e. , from the eigenvalue @xmath94 , so within linear theory the size of the perturbation does not change under the action of the rg transformation .",
    "that is , the perturbation with such an eigenfunction is marginal , and we have to extend the rg formulation to terms nonlinear in @xmath59 .    for the fixed point with nonzero @xmath2",
    ", when the parent distribution has a power asymptote , the case of @xmath95 seems to be atypical , because @xmath96 has a logarithmic singularity as shown in . on the other hand , in the ftg class with @xmath54 the case @xmath95 can be considered as generic , because the correction function @xmath102 represents the natural analytic perturbation in ( [ eq : meps ] ) .",
    "we shall thus limit the rg study in the nonlinear neighborhood of the fixed line to the ftg case . consider the most natural extension of ( [ eq : meps ] ) with @xmath103 ( these arguments will be omitted in this section ) as @xmath104 where @xmath105 and we require @xmath106 where the first two equations follow from the standardization condition while the third one sets the scale of @xmath59 .",
    "the rg transformation is again given by ( [ eq : rg - lin ] ) where the right - hand - side should be expanded to second order in @xmath59 and    [ eq : ab - nonlin ] @xmath107    here the terms up to linear order in @xmath59 were taken from the @xmath108 limit of ( [ eq : fp - fab2 ] ) . since by the eigenvalue is now @xmath109 , i.e. , the eigenfunction is marginal to linear order , we assume an analytic extension of @xmath110 as @xmath111 nonlinear stability then requires @xmath112 , thus @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath114 then we have an unstable direction .    straightforward calculation based on the rg transformation of together with ( [ eq : ab - nonlin],[eq : marginality ] ) yields @xmath115 the @xmath19-independent solution @xmath116 of this equation is linear @xmath117 where @xmath118 is arbitrary , and @xmath119 is determined as @xmath120 hence @xmath121 and using ( [ eq : psi2-cond ] ) we obtain @xmath122 thus we find that in this order a new additional parameter @xmath118 arises .",
    "the corrections to the transformation parameters can also be calculated as @xmath123    nonanalytic corrections dominating the quadratic in @xmath59 can studied by the ansatz @xmath124 carrying out an analysis similar to the above one , we again obtain the cubic eigenfunction ( [ eq : psi - cub ] ) but now @xmath125 .    next , the above results will be used to obtain practicable finite - size expressions in evs .",
    "so far we have been studying the abstract space of distribution functions under the action of the rg transformation .",
    "below we explain how the results on the eigenfunctions near a fixed point can be translated to the size dependence of the convergence to the limiting evd starting out from a particular parent distribution .",
    "consider the basic situation described in sec .",
    "[ s : iid - fp ] , namely , the evd @xmath17 approaches one of the fixed points @xmath57 for a diverging batch size @xmath0 .",
    "then it is natural to assume that the convergence for large @xmath0 occurs along a dominant eigenfunction , approximated by the form , with some @xmath126 .",
    "further @xmath19 iterates of the extreme value distribution by the rg transformation corresponds to increasing the batch size to @xmath127 , and so , according to ( [ eq : rg - lin ] ) , it generates a new perturbation parameter @xmath128 using now @xmath129 ( [ eq : evalue ] ) and assuming a power law dependence for @xmath130 , one obtains @xmath131 hence the meaning of the parameter @xmath3 follows , it is the exponent of the leading finite - size correction to the limit distribution .",
    "clearly , @xmath84 is needed for power - like decay whereas a correction faster or slower than power - law should be characterized within the rg theory of linear perturbations by a @xmath132 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "one expects that slower than power such as logarithmic corrections are also consistent with and they emerge in the @xmath133 limit .",
    "we study this case by considering the marginal situation near the ftg fixed point , as described in sec .",
    "[ s : iid - nlrg ] .",
    "again we take an @xmath130 function , and get in one rg step @xmath134 .",
    "expanding the reciprocal of ( [ eq : eps - nl ] ) yields in leading order @xmath135 this is a functional equation for @xmath136 , whose solution is the logarithm function , yielding @xmath137 thus in the case @xmath103 the natural assumption of analyticity in @xmath59 leads to the cubic next - to - leading correction , and entails the logarithmic decay of the finite - size correction .",
    "this can be considered as the generic stable manifold about the ftg fixed point and explains the typically slow , @xmath1 , decay of the corrections .",
    "note that the above results consistently describe stable perturbations . indeed , ( [ eq : eps - nl ] ) gives an @xmath66 closer to zero than @xmath59 , if @xmath59 has the same sign as @xmath138 .",
    "but this is just what we obtained in ( [ eq : eps - nlin ] ) .",
    "a more general case is when the nonlinear extension in the marginal situation is .",
    "translating that to the finite - size correction we have in the end @xmath139^{\\frac{1}{\\xi-1}}}. \\label{eq : eps - log - xi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence rg theory accounts for faster - than - logarithmic decay in the case of an invariant manifold nonanalytic in @xmath59 .",
    "the conclusions drawn from the results of the rg study beyond the linear region are quite revealing .",
    "the correction characterizes how fast the parent distribution approaches the ftg fixed point .",
    "a quite slow but typical case is when the parent is attracted by the rg transformation to an invariant manifold analytic in both @xmath44 and the perturbation parameter @xmath59 , yielding a finite - size correction logarithmically decaying in @xmath0 .",
    "if the @xmath59-dependence is not analytic in next - to - leading order then a larger power of the log and so faster decay is obtained .",
    "these cases correspond to @xmath95 and polynomial corrections in @xmath44 , quadratic in leading and cubic in next - to - leading order .",
    "faster , essentially power - law correction is obtained if the convergence is characterized by @xmath84 , when the correction function is no longer polynomial .",
    "finally , faster than power decay corresponds to the case @xmath140 , thus it falls beyond the validity of the present rg theory .",
    "it remains to be seen how the perturbation parameter @xmath130 can be determined from the parent distribution .",
    "that is , we start out from the classic extreme value problem of the distribution of the maximum of @xmath0 i.i.d .  variables , each characterized by the same parent distribution .",
    "let us write the integrated parent distribution as @xmath141 then the distribution of the maximum of @xmath0 variables is @xmath142 let us assume that @xmath12 belongs to the domain of attraction of the fixed point distribution @xmath57 from .",
    "then , by using the linear transformation ensuring the standardization @xmath143 one obtains @xmath144 our basic assumption is that for large but finite @xmath0 the approach to the fixed point goes along some eigendirection as @xmath145 here @xmath130 gives the order of the correction and is assumed to vanish for large @xmath0 as characterized by the exponent @xmath4 .    taking the double negative logarithm of both sides and using we get @xmath146 in the next step we shall use the properties ( [ eq : f - norm ] ) and ( [ eq : psi ] ) together with the equalities @xmath147 and ( [ eq : an ] )",
    ". then double differentiation of at @xmath148 yields the perturbation parameter @xmath149 where @xmath150 the second equality follows from and is useful in practical calculations .    to summarize the practical recipe , given a parent distribution , one calculates @xmath151 and if @xmath152 then the parent belongs to the domain of attraction of the fixed point with parameter @xmath2 .",
    "then one determines @xmath130 from ( [ eq : epsilonn ] ) at least to leading order , whose approach to zero is characterized by the exponent @xmath4 , see .",
    "this exponent also determines the eigenfunction @xmath92 in the final approach to the fixed point , as it appears in . in the end , by linear expansion of",
    ", we obtain the leading correction to the fixed point distribution in the form @xmath153 corresponding to the density @xmath154 we relegate to a later work a more detailed discussion of the connection to the parent distributions .",
    "some examples of specific parents will be considered below .",
    "the picture that emerges from the rg study complements the long - known connection between the fisher - tippett max - stability condition and the limit distributions . by reformulating the former as the fixed point relation of an appropriately defined rg transformation",
    ", we can then solve the eigenvalue problem for distributions close to a fixed point .",
    "these eigenfunctions will then appear as correction functions in the final approach to the limit distribution for large batch sizes @xmath0 .",
    "one new parameter labeling the eigenfunctions also emerged , the characteristic exponent of the convergence in @xmath0 .",
    "the case of marginality , @xmath95 , deserves a special mention . as it was discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : iid - lin - mg ] , nearby points on the fixed line are connected by marginal eigenfunctions .",
    "using and substituting there @xmath59 by @xmath155 , we realize that the distribution is , up to leading order , a fixed point distribution with a modified index @xmath156 this property was noted already by fisher and tippett @xcite in the case of the gaussian parent , and studied since then in the mathematical literature , see @xcite . in the rg picture",
    "such an asymptote means that the final approach to a fixed point is tangential to the fixed line , which happens when the finite - size correction decays slower than a power law .",
    "we demonstrate the asymptotic analysis above on the example of a parent distribution , whose asymptote for @xmath157 is of the following generalized exponential form @xmath158 the leading singular parts of the shift and scale parameters are obtained from ( [ eq : bn],[eq : an ] ) , respectively , as @xmath159 next we calculate from the effective parameter @xmath160 the limit gives of course @xmath161 the parameter for the ftg fixed point .",
    "hence the perturbation parameter to leading order is    @xmath162    we call the attention to the fact that the above expressions do not depend on @xmath163 and @xmath164 , they would enter only in the next order in @xmath1 .",
    "it should also be noted that the case @xmath165 is special since it is not sufficiently specified by and further corrections to the asymptote need to be included .",
    "a representative case is the pure exponential parent distribution which will be treated below in this section .    in the cases described by",

    "thus it matters which distribution we start with , because they will track different manifolds .",
    "more variants equivalent to linear order are also possible , but we restrict our attention to the above two types .    a problem to be considered when various linear perturbations are introduced , as in eqs .  , is that we should have a valid ( monotonic from 0 to 1 ) distribution for finite @xmath59 in some support in @xmath10 . since the eigenfunctions @xmath206 are non - monotonic in @xmath10",
