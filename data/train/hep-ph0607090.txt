    "in scenarios where the electroweak scale is stabilized by supersymmetry , it is expected that future collider experiments give us hints of how the standard model sector feels the supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it is now important to discuss possible mechanisms for supersymmetry breaking and its mediation .    in field theory ,",
    "spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is quite easily realized .",
    "an obvious example is the polonyi model in which a singlet chiral superfield @xmath0 has a linear superpotential @xmath1 .",
    "this model also serves as the low energy effective theory of the oraifeartaigh model by introducing a non - minimal k \"",
    "ahler potential term @xmath2 with @xmath3 the mass scale of the particles which are integrated out",
    ". the same effective theory can also be realized in models with strongly coupled gauge theories such as in the iyit model in ref .",
    "recently it has been noticed that a wide class of supersymmetric qcd leads to the above effective theory around the meta - stable vacuum  @xcite .    even though spontaneous supersymmetry breaking may be a common feature of quantum field theory , mediation of the supersymmetry breaking to the standard model sector",
    "is not so simple .",
    "of course , gravity mediation is the simplest way to communicate with the hidden sector .",
    "however , we study the possibility of gauge mediation partly because it provides us with a solution to the flavor problem  @xcite ( see @xcite for earlier works . ) .    a naive way of realizing gauge mediation is to introduce vector - like messenger particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 which carry standard model quantum numbers and assume a coupling @xmath6 in the superpotential .",
    "assuming non - vanishing vacuum expectation values in the lowest and the @xmath7-component of @xmath0 , the gaugino masses are obtained by the formula @xmath8 at one - loop level .",
    "however , this model has a supersymmetric and hence global minimum where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the question is whether it is possible to have a meta - stable vacuum with non - vanishing value of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the oraifeartaigh model , the sign of the coefficient of the k \" ahler term @xmath11 is negative , which stabilizes the field @xmath0 at the origin .",
    "therefore , there is no meta - stable vacuum away from the origin",
    ".    mechanisms of realizing a ( local ) minimum away from the origin have been discussed in the literature . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the inverted hierarchy mechanism can produce a local minimum at a very large value of @xmath0 if @xmath0 is non - singlet under some gauge interaction .",
    "the possibility of having a ( local ) minimum via a non - perturbative effect has also been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite for discussions of the vacuum structure of the iyit model . ) .",
    "the introduction of a bare mass term for the messenger field also makes the vacuum meta - stable as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the context of supersymmetry",
    "breaking in chiral gauge theories , it has been discussed that a runaway direction which is lifted only by non - renormalizable operators has a minimum at a very large field value  @xcite .    in this note , we argue that the situation of supersymmetry restoration by the messenger particles can be cured once we include the supergravity effect even if the origin is the unique minimum in the limit of the planck scale @xmath12 to infinity . although the gravity effect is always suppressed by @xmath13 , it can be large enough to stabilize @xmath0 away from the origin ( @xmath14 ) when @xmath15  gev .",
    "the model we will analyze is the following : @xmath16 @xmath17 the chiral superfield @xmath0 is a singlet field , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the messenger fields which carry standard model quantum numbers , and @xmath18 is a coupling constant .",
    "the constant term @xmath19 does not have any effect if we neglect gravity interactions , but it is important for the cancellation of the cosmological constant . if we neglect the constant term @xmath19 , the lagrangian possesses an @xmath20-symmetry with the charge assignments @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we first discuss the model without gravity effect ( @xmath23 limit ) .    for @xmath24",
    ", this model breaks supersymmetry and @xmath0 is stabilized at the origin , @xmath9 , by the supersymmetry breaking effect .",
    "however , by turning on the @xmath18 coupling , @xmath4 and @xmath5 acquire tachyonic mass terms ( @xmath25-term ) which make the vacuum unstable .",
    "the true minimum is at @xmath9 and @xmath26 where supersymmetry is unbroken .",
    "therefore , there is no supersymmetry breaking vacuum in this model .",
    "we assumed here that the sign of the second term in the k \" ahler potential is negative as it is the case in the oraifeartaigh model .",
    "in general , the sign can be positive , and sometimes it is even uncalculable if this term is originated from some strong dynamics .",
    "when it is positive , the @xmath0 field may be stabilized away from the origin and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions are also stabilized at @xmath27 by the supersymmetric mass terms .",
    "however , we consider the case with a negative sign where the origin is a stable minimum . as we will see later ,",
    "the supersymmetry breaking minimum reappears when we turn on the gravity effect even in that case .",
    "first , we need to estimate the perturbative quantum correction to the k \" ahler potential for @xmath0 coming from the interaction term @xmath28 , which may be more important than the gravity effect .",
    "we can explicitly calculate the term at one - loop level : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of components in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "for example , @xmath31 if @xmath4 and @xmath5 transforms as @xmath32 and @xmath33 under su(5)@xmath34 .",
    "higher order perturbative contributions , including the dependence on the artificial scale @xmath35 , will be minimized by taking the running coupling constant @xmath18 to be the value near the scale @xmath0 .",
    "this term also tends to make @xmath9 stable .",
    "now we include the gravity effect in this model .",
    "the scalar potential of the supergravity lagrangian is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and we set @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is the derivative of @xmath40 with respect to the field @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the inverse of the k \" ahler metric .",
    "@xmath43 represents the @xmath44-term contributions .",
    "we can easily find the supersymmetric minimum , that is a solution of the equations : @xmath45 the solution is @xmath46 the gravity effect is a slight shift of the values of order @xmath47 which is @xmath48 if we assume the cancellation of the cosmological constant at the meta - stable supersymmetry breaking vacuum below .",
    "another minimum can be found with the assumption of @xmath27 .",
    "the potential is simplified to @xmath49 the equation @xmath50 with the phenomenological requirement @xmath51 , cancellation of the cosmological constant , leads to @xmath52 \\simeq \\frac{2 \\sqrt{3}}{3 m_{\\rm pl}}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the minimum is at @xmath55 supersymmetry is broken there with @xmath56 . by taking the limit @xmath57 , this minimum moves to @xmath58 and the meta - stable vacuum disappears .",
    "however , with a finite value of @xmath12 , the supersymmetry breaking and supersymmetric vacua are at the different places .    in the @xmath59 limit",
    ", there is no supersymmetric vacuum as in the case without gravity , but the minimum is not at the origin ( @xmath60 ) , even though the sign of the @xmath61 term in k \" aher potential is negative . in the supergravity lagrangian ,",
    "the origin is no longer a symmetry enhanced point because the @xmath20-symmetry is explicitly broken by the @xmath19-term . by turning on the @xmath18 coupling",
    ", the supersymmetric vacuum appears near the origin , but it is separated from the supersymmetry breaking minimum .",
    "the disappearance of the supersymmetry breaking minimum by the finite @xmath18 coupling seen before was an artifact of the approximation @xmath57 .",
    "the stability of the vacuum can be checked by looking at the mass matrices of the @xmath0 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 fields .",
    "the matrices are given by @xmath62 therefore , there is a stable minimum when @xmath54 and @xmath63 .",
    "there is another phenomenological requirement that the gauge mediation effect , the gaugino masses , is of order 100  gev .",
    "this fixes the relation between the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath3 as follows : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the electroweak scale . with this relation ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] the parameter region where the supersymmetry breaking vacuum is meta - stable .",
    "a gravitational stabilization of the vacuum is possible for @xmath67  gev . for large @xmath18 , the one - loop correction to the @xmath0 potential destabilizes the vacuum , and too small @xmath18 leads to unstable @xmath4 and @xmath5 direction because of the small supersymmetric mass terms .",
