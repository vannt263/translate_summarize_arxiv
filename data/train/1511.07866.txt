    "the chromatic number of a graph @xmath1 is by definition the fewest number of colors needed to color the vertices of @xmath1 in such a way that adjacent vertices receive distinct colors .",
    "this seemingly innocent concept is one of the most well - studied notions in combinatorics . while upper bounds on chromatic number are in some sense straightforward ( just `",
    "write down a coloring ' ) finding lower bounds often requires methods from diverse branches of mathematics . here",
    "we wish to study two of the most striking approaches developed in recent years : one involving basic notions from equivariant algebraic topology , and one invoking constructions from probability and statistical mechanics . in both cases",
    "it will be convenient to phrase chromatic number in the language of graph homomorphims ; this places the notion in a more general context and also allows us to use basic ideas from category theory . in this language ,",
    "a coloring of @xmath1 using @xmath11 colors is nothing but a graph homomorphism from @xmath1 to @xmath12 .",
    "the topological approach to bounding chromatic number goes back to lovsz s remarkable proof of the kneser conjecture @xcite . here",
    "lovsz introduced the neighborhood complex @xmath13 of a graph @xmath1 and showed that the topological connectivity of @xmath13 provided a lower bound on @xmath0 . in more modern treatments we recover @xmath14 as a space of homomorphisms from the edge @xmath3 into the graph @xmath1 ( homomorphisms from an edge ) , an example of the more general @xmath7-complexes @xmath15 of homomorphisms between two graphs @xmath16 and @xmath1 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "precise definitions are given in section  [ sec : basics ] , but the basic idea is that @xmath2 is a polyhedral complex with 0-cells given by all directed edges of @xmath1 , with higher dimensional cells given by directed complete bipartite graphs . in this language , a main result of @xcite is that for any graph @xmath1 we have @xmath17    here we use the convention that @xmath18 if @xmath19 is nonempty and disconnected . in more recent work @xcite , babson and kozlov showed that the space of homomorphisms from an odd cycle into @xmath1 provided the next expected lower bound on @xmath0 ( see also @xcite for a short proof of this result ) .",
    "on the statistical physics side , brightwell and winkler studied the notion of ` long range action ' of graph homomorphisms , and defined the _ warmth _ of a graph @xmath1 in terms of homomorphisms from the ( infinite ) @xmath20-branching tree @xmath21 .",
    "the idea is a generalization of the observation that , if @xmath22 is a _",
    "bipartite _ graph",
    ", then we can restrict the possibilities of the initial position of a random walk ( thought of as a map from the one - branching tree @xmath23 to @xmath22 ) , if we know where the walk is at the @xmath11th step , regardless of how large @xmath11 is .",
    "the warmth @xmath4 quantifies , in a way that will be made precise in section  [ sec : basics ] , how large @xmath20 needs to be for the same to be true for maps @xmath24 .",
    "brightwell and winkler @xcite show that warmth provides a lower bound on chromatic number : for any graph @xmath1 we have @xmath25    as both warmth @xmath4 and connectivity of @xmath13 provide lower bounds on chromatic number , the natural question that arises is whether the two parameters themselves are related .",
    "we note that both are defined in terms of homomorphisms of certain graphs _ into _",
    "@xmath1 ( which is why it is somewhat surprising that they influence @xmath0 , which is defined in terms of homomorphisms _ from _ @xmath1 ) .",
    "in particular they both behave well with respect to categorical graph products .",
    "both invariants also provide tight bounds on the chromatic number of complete graphs @xmath12 , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the space @xmath28 can in fact be realized as the boundary of an @xmath29-dimensional convex polytope .    aside from these similarities",
    "the two parameters borrow techniques from quite disparate branches of mathematics , so finding any connection would be of interest . as we have seen , the warmth of a graph is obtained by considering maps from _ infinite trees _ into the graph @xmath1 , whereas the connectivity of a @xmath6 is defined in terms of maps from _ spheres _ into the space of directed edges of @xmath1 .",
    "a small example of a graph @xmath1 satisfying @xmath30 is given by the _ grotszch graph _ on 11 nodes and 20 edges  @xcite .    indeed , the grotszch graph is a special case of the mycielski construction @xmath31 .",
    "the mycielski construction always increases the chromatic number of a graph @xmath1 by 1 , and up to homotopy corresponds to suspending the neighborhood complex  @xcite @xmath13 .",
    "hence it preserves tightness of the bound @xmath32 .",
    "however , it may fail to increase warmth : the grotszch graph @xmath33 has warmth @xmath34 as shown in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the warmth of a graph @xmath1 can be smaller than three plus the connectivity of @xmath13 .",
    "in fact the gap between warmth and connectivity of the neighborhood complex can be arbitrarily large . as discussed in @xcite , the family of kneser graph @xmath35 has neighborhood complex connectivity @xmath36 and constant warmth 3 .",
    "furthermore , if we allow loops on our vertices ( which of course takes us out of the world of finite chromatic number ) we see that there can even be an infinite gap between the values of these two parameters . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that a graph @xmath1 has @xmath37 if and only if @xmath1 is ` dismantlable ' , meaning that it can be folded down to a single looped vertex ( see section [ sec : bipartite ] for more details ) . there",
    "exist graphs @xmath1 with the property that @xmath13 is contractible and yet @xmath1 is not dismantlable , so in this case we have @xmath38 and yet @xmath4 finite .",
    "this leads to the question whether warmth is _ always _ less than three plus the connectivity of the neighborhood complex . indeed",
    "the following conjecture , first published in @xcite will motivate the rest of our work in this paper .",
    "[ mainconj ] for any finite graph @xmath1 we have @xmath39    conjecture [ mainconj ] suggests a nice relationship between the long range action of infinite @xmath20-branching trees and the homotopy classes of maps from a @xmath20-sphere into the edge space of a graph .",
    "it should be noted that if @xmath16 is any _ finite _ tree , it can be shown that @xmath15 is homotopy equivalent to the space @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "conjecture [ mainconj ] is related to some other open questions posed by brightwell and winkler at the end of @xcite , focussing on the connection between warmth , chromatic numbers , and another invariant known as mobility .",

    "we let @xmath12 denote the complete graph consisting of @xmath11 vertices and all possible ( non loop ) edges .",
    "the chromatic number @xmath0 of a graph @xmath1 is defined as @xmath65      we first address the warmth of a graph as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we begin with some basic definitions form @xcite .    a graph map @xmath66 is _ cold _ if there exists a node @xmath67 such that for any integer @xmath68 , there does not exist a graph map @xmath69 such that @xmath70 agrees with @xmath71 on the vertices of @xmath21 at distance @xmath68 from the root @xmath63 but has @xmath72 .",
