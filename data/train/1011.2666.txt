    "as a single atomic layer extracted from graphite , graphene has been successfully fabricated experimentally.@xcite due to its peculiar topological structure , the graphene exhibits peculiar properties.@xcite for the graphene sheet , the conduction and valence band in graphene intersect at dirac points , the corners of the hexagonal first brillouin zone . around the dirac points graphene",
    "has a unique band structure and its quasi particles satisfy the massless dirac equation where the speed of light is replaced by the fermi velocity of graphene ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "experimentally , by varying the gate voltage , the charge carriers of graphene can be easily tuned , globally@xcite or locally@xcite . as a result",
    "the fermi level can be above or below the dirac points , which is viewed as electron - like or hole - like system . along the different crystal direction in honeycomb lattice , the band structure@xcite and the transport properties are different . for the graphene ribbon with the zigzag edge , a special edge state exists.@xcite while for the graphene ribbon with armchair edge , it is metallic when the transverse layer @xmath6 with integer m and insulator otherwise.@xcite when the perpendicular magnetic field is strong enough to form landau levels ( lls ) , these differences due to different chirality at the zero magnetic field disappear .",
    "in addition , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally,@xcite the hall conductance was found to be the half - integer in the values @xmath7 with degeneracy @xmath8 , indicating that the quantization condition is shifted by a half - integer compared with the usual integer quantum hall effect .",
    "it is a direct manifestation of the unique electronic structure of graphene .",
    "the thermoelectric power ( tep ) , or the thermal gradient induced current ( or bias with an open boundary ) , results from a balance of electric and thermal forces acting on the charge carriers . in general , we consider two thermoelectric powers , the nernst effect which is the transverse tep induced by a longitudinal thermal gradient in a perpendicular magnetic field and the seebeck effect which is the thermal gradient induced bias in a two probe system .",
    "tep is of great importance in understanding electronic transport because it is more sensitive to the details of the density of states @xcite and the particle - hole asymmetry@xcite than the conductance . in the early days , because of the experimental difficulty ( particularly in low - dimensional systems or nano - devices ) , the nernst effect and seebeck effect are often neglected . instead",
    ", one usually measures the hall effect and the resistivity .",
    "now , with the development of the micro - fabrication technology and the low - temperature measurement technology , the thermoelectric measurement in low - dimensional samples has been feasible.@xcite recently , the nernst effect and seebeck effect have been widely observed and experimentally investigated in many systems , including the high - tc superconductivity,@xcite ferromagnets,@xcite semimetallic,@xcite pyrochlore molybdates,@xcite bismuch,@xcite single walled carbon nanotube,@xcite etc .",
    "for the graphene , the study of thermoelectric properties can elucidate details of the electronic structure of the ambipolar nature that can not be realized by probing conductance alone .",
    "very recently , using a microfabricated heater and thermometer electrodes , the conductance and the diffusive tep of graphene are simultaneously measured by zuev _",

    "direct measurement of seebeck coefficient @xmath9 can be compared with that calculated from the mott relation.@xcite furthermore , divergence of @xmath9 and the large nernst signal were found near the charge neutral point ( i.e. the dirac point).@xcite also , at low temperatures , depending on @xmath10 , tep is oscillating .",
    "the temperature suppresses the oscillation and enhances the magnitude of tep .    up to now",
    ", some theoretical investigations have been carried out on the thermal response in the graphene .",
    "the electronic transport coefficients including thermopower was semiclassically treated and only classical hall effect ( low field ) in graphene was studied.@xcite in addition , the nernst coefficient was studied only in weak magnetic field .",
    "it was found to be strong and positive near dirac point.@xcite for a strong magnetic field in the quantum hall regime , the seebeck coefficient was studied and was focused on its dependence of the field orientation.@xcite in all these works , the quantum nernst effect is absent because of the calculational subtleties in the presence of the strong magnetic field .",
    "for the normal two dimensional electron gas characterized by a parabolic dispersion , the nernst effect has been studied.@xcite of these works , two alternative boundary conditions were considered in calculating the thermal response functions .",
    "one is the adiabatic boundary condition that the temperatures in the upper and lower edge are fixed . in this case",
    "the nernst coefficient is similar to the seebeck coefficient.@xcite the other one is the non - adiabatic boundary condition on the upper and lower edges , in which the edge currents are in contact with two heat baths with different temperatures.@xcite the nernst coefficient is different from the seebeck coefficient .",
    "it is the purpose of our work to focus on the quantum nernst effect in the graphene nanoribbon with the adiabatic boundary condition .    in this paper , we carry out a theoretical study of the nernst effect in a crossed graphene nanoribbon and the seebeck effect in a single graphene nanoribbon in the strong perpendicular magnetic field , zero magnetic field , and weak magnetic field . by using the tight binding model and the nonequilibrium green function method , the transmission coefficient and consequently the nernst and seebeck coefficients are obtained . in a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath11 ,",
    "high degenerated lls are formed , and the edge states dominate the transport processes , so the nernst ( seebeck ) coefficients are almost the same along the different chiral directions .",
    "we find that the nernst coefficient @xmath12 and the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 show peaks when the fermi energy @xmath10 passes the lls . at @xmath13 , because the zeroth ll is shared by electron - like and hole - like landau states , @xmath12 which is an even function of @xmath10 has the highest peak while @xmath9 which is an odd function of @xmath10 vanishes . on the other hand , at zero @xmath11",
    ", there is no lorentz force to bend the trajectories of the thermally diffusing carriers , so nernst effect is absent . in this case",
    ", the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 is strongly dependent on the chirality of graphene ribbon . in particular , for the insulating armchair ribbon , @xmath9 can be very large near the dirac point . at last ,",
    "the crossover behavior of the thermoelectric power from the zero magnetic field to the strong magnetic field is also studied .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the models for crossed graphene ribbon or single graphene ribbon are introduced .",
    "the formalisms for calculating the nernst and seebeck coefficient are then derived .",

    "we consider two graphene systems : a four terminal crossed graphene nanoribbon and a two terminal graphene nanoribbon as shown in the left and right insets of fig.1(b ) . here",
    "we consider ballistic two dimensional electron gas in which the mean free path and the phase coherent length are greater than the device size . in the experiment",
    ", we can use the smaller sample to reduce the device size , and use the lower temperature or the higher magnetic field to enhance the phase coherent length . in the tight - binding representation",

    "@xmath19 is the on - site energy ( i.e. the energy of the dirac point ) which can be controlled experimentally by the gate voltage , here we set @xmath20 as an energy zero point .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath11 is expressed in terms of magnetic flux @xmath72 in the unit of @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the area of a honeycomb unit cell and @xmath26 is the flux quanta .",
    "if we set @xmath75 , the real magnetic field is around @xmath76 .",
    "the width of the graphene ribbon is described by an integer @xmath77 , and the corresponding real width is @xmath78 for zigzag edge nanoribbon and @xmath79 for the armchair edge nanoribbon . in the schematic setup-1i and setup-1ii in the inset of fig.1b , @xmath80 . in the presence of the strong perpendicular magnetic field ,",
    "since transport properties are independent of the chirality , we choose the setup-1i shown in the left inset of fig.1(b ) to study the nernst effect and the setup-1ii shown in right inset of fig.1(b ) to study the seebeck effect . on the other hand , when the magnetic field is zero , the seebeck effect strongly depends on the edge chirality , so we will study both zigzag and armchair edge nanoribbons , respectively .",
    "firstly , we study the system with strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "fig.1 shows the nernst coefficient @xmath12 and seebeck coefficient @xmath9 versus fermi energy @xmath10 for different temperatures @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "considering the ambipolar nature of the graphene and the electron - hole symmetry , the nernst coefficient @xmath12 is an even function of @xmath10 [ @xmath85 , because both the energy @xmath86 and the direction of the particle movement ( or @xmath87 ) reverse their signs under the electron - hole transformation . from fig.1(a ) , we see that the nernst coefficient @xmath12 show peaks when @xmath10 passes the lls @xmath88 and show valleys between adjacent lls . with the increase of the temperature ,",
    "the peak heights roughly remain unchanged , but the valleys rise . for convenience , the peaks are numbered and the peak at @xmath13 is denoted as the zeroth peak . in the low temperature limits , for the @xmath0-th peak with @xmath89 ,",
    "the height is @xmath2 $ ] , and the zeroth peak height is @xmath4 $ ] . in fig.2(a ) we plot inverse of the peak heights versus the peak number @xmath0 ( see the crossed circle symbols ) at the low temperature @xmath81 .",
    "it satisfies the relation @xmath90 $ ] . for comparison ,",
    "the inverse of the peak s height for the conventional metal is also plotted ( see dotted pentagram symbol ) , which is @xmath91 $ ] .    in fig.1(b )",
    ", we plot the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 versus @xmath10 at different temperatures @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 display peaks when @xmath10 passes the lls and show valleys between adjacent lls .",
    "however , @xmath9 shows two essential differences from the nernst effect : first , @xmath9 is an odd function of @xmath10 , which means that contributions to @xmath9 from electrons and holes differ by a sign due to the electron - hole symmetry .",
    "so the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 is negative for @xmath92 .",
    "second , when @xmath10 is on the zero - th ll , @xmath9 is zero instead of the highest peak in the curve of @xmath12-@xmath10 .",
    "this is because the zero - th ll with the fourfold degeneracy is shared equally by electrons and holes and the electrons and holes give the opposite contributions to @xmath9 .",
    "the inverse of the peak height of seebeck coefficient at the low temperature ( @xmath93 ) is plotted in fig.2(b ) .",
    "it is found that in graphene , the pseudospin related berry phase @xcite introduces an additional phase shift in the magneto - oscillation of tep . as a result of this phase shift ,",
    "the inverse of peak height is @xmath94 ( see the crossed circle symbol in fig.2(b ) ) . while in the conventional metal or semiconductor with massive carriers ,",
    "there is no pseudospin related berry phase , the inverse of peak height is @xmath95 ( see dotted pentacle symbol in fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "next , we study the temperature effect .",
    "since tep ( nernst effect or seebeck effect ) represents the entropy transported per unit charge , both nernst coefficient and seebeck coefficient increase with the increasing temperature which are exhibited in fig.1(a ) and ( b ) . to take a closer look in fig.3",
    ", we plot the zeroth and first peak for the temperature range @xmath96 $ ] in the step of @xmath97 .",
    "the temperature effect of @xmath9 is similar to that of @xmath12 , so we only show the nernst coefficient @xmath9 in fig.3(a ) . at low temperatures , with the increase of the temperature @xmath98 ,",
    "the peak height and position do not vary much , but the peak half - width is broadened proportional to @xmath99 , so the valley between the lls rises .",
    "when the temperature @xmath100 exceeds the spacing of nearest lls , the nernst and seebeck coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath9 are enhanced in the whole range of energies including both the peak and valley because of the overlap of the neighboring peaks .",
    "in addition , except for the zeroth peak , the peak positions for all other peaks shift towards the zeroth peak .",
    "now we study the disorder effect on the nernst and seeback effect . to consider the effect of disorder , random on - site",
    "potentials @xmath101 in the center region are added with a uniform distribution @xmath102 $ ] with disorder strength w. the data is obtained by averaging over up to 1200 disorder configurations .",
    "it is known that when the magnetic field is absent , the seebeck effect is strongly affected by the disorder , and the peaks are suppressed even in the small disorder . on the other hand , in the presence of the strong magnetic field ,",
    "the seebeck effect and nernst effect are robust to the disorder , because of the existence of the quantized landau level .",
    "the bigger the sample is ( or the stronger the magnetic field is ) , the more robust the nernst effect and seebeck effect . similar to fig.3(a ) , in fig.3(b ) we plot the zeroth and first peak at fixed temperature @xmath103 with different disorder strengths . here",
    "sample size ( @xmath104 ) is smaller than that in fig.1(a ) ( in which @xmath105 ) . with the smaller sample size",
    ", the zeroth universal values of peak height @xmath106 can still remain until disorder @xmath107 is larger than @xmath108 .",
    "for the first peak , the universal values of height @xmath109 remains at @xmath110 and washes out at stronger disorder .",
    "it means that the nernst peak corresponding to the lower landauer level can resist stronger disorders .",
    "in fact , this effect of disorder has been studied for the thermal response to the charge current@xcite or to the spin current.@xcite so , in the following , we will focus only on the clean system .      in this subsection , we study the tep at zero magnetic field . because there is no lorentz force to bend the trajectories of the thermally diffusing carriers , the nernst effect is absent and @xmath111 . at @xmath112 ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 is strongly dependent on the chirality of graphene ribbon .",
    "in addition , for the armchair edge ribbon , it is metallic when @xmath6 ( @xmath113 is an integer ) and insulator otherwise.@xcite the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 has essential difference for the metallic and insulator armchair ribbons . in the following we consider three different systems :",
    "( 1 ) zigzag edge ribbon with width @xmath104 ( sketched in inset of fig.4(a ) ) , ( 2 ) metallic armchair edge ribbon with width @xmath114 ( sketched in inset of fig.4(b ) ) , and ( 3 ) insulating armchair edge ribbon with width @xmath104 ( sketched in inset of fig.4(b ) ) .",
    "fig.4(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 versus @xmath10 for the above three systems , respectively . for the convenience of discussion , we also plot corresponding transmission coefficient @xmath115 versus @xmath10 in each panel .",
    "we can see that @xmath9 is an odd function of @xmath10 and @xmath9 increases when the temperature increases .",
    "in addition , @xmath9 peaks when fermi energy crosses the discrete transverse channels where quantized transmission coefficient jumps from one step to another .",
    "these properties are similar for the above three cases .",
    "but there are also many essential different behaviors .",
    "( 1 ) . for the zigzag edge ribbon , the transverse channels are equidistance with the energy interval @xmath116 in the conduction band or the valence band ( except that the interval from the first transmission channel in the conduction band to the first transmission channel in the valence band is @xmath117 )",
    ". so peaks of @xmath9 are uniformly distributed over energies and the peak height of @xmath9 satisfies @xmath118 $ ] where @xmath0 is the peak number ( see fig.4(a ) ) .",
    "( 2 ) . in metallic armchair edge ribbon , however , the transverse channel and consequently the peaks of @xmath9 are irregularly distributed .",
    "the peak height of @xmath9 is closely related to the transmission coefficient @xmath115 and it can be expressed as @xmath119 at low temperatures , where @xmath120 is the change of @xmath121 when @xmath10 scans over the certain transverse channel . with increasing of the temperature , some of peaks that are very close to each other merge together so that both peak height and position are irregular ( see fig.4(b ) ) .",
    "( 3 ) . finally ,",
    "for the insulating armchair edge ribbon , except for the irregularly distributed peaks for @xmath122 , the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 is very large for @xmath10 near the dirac point ( 0 ) at low temperatures .",
    "fig.5 magnifies the curves of @xmath9-@xmath10 near the dirac point . at low temperatures",
    ", @xmath9 can be very large when @xmath10 approaches the dirac point .",
    "for example @xmath9 can reach about @xmath123 at @xmath124 . at the dirac",
    "point the sign of @xmath9 changes abruptly .",
    "this is because near the dirac point the transmission coefficient @xmath125 is zero and the carriers ca nt be transmitted .",
    "in order to balance the thermal forces acting on the charge carriers , we have to add a very large bias leading to a very large seebeck coefficient near the dirac point at low temperatures .",
    "when temperature increase such that @xmath100 is greater than the gap of the insulating armchair edge ribbon @xmath9 decreases gradually .",
    "we emphasize that if the armchair edge ribbon is narrow enough ( such as @xmath126 as in our calculation ) , @xmath127 at the temperature @xmath128 .",
    "this very large @xmath9 can be observed in the present technology .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the nernst and seebeck effect when the magnetic field varies from zero to finite values ( strong magnetic field ) . at zero magnetic field ,",
    "the nernst coefficient @xmath12 is zero and the seebeck effect @xmath9 is dependent on the chirality of graphene ribbon . at high magnetic fields , however , both @xmath12 and @xmath9 are independent of the ribbon chirality . what happens with the magnetic field in the intermediate range ?",
    "first , we study the nernst effect , in which two different setups ( the setup-6i and setup-6ii ) sketched in the top of fig.6 are considered . in fig.6",
    "we plot the nernst coefficient @xmath12 versus @xmath10 at different temperatures and magnetic fields . from fig.6(a ) to ( c ) , the magnetic field increases from weak to strong enough to form edge state . at the weak magnetic field",
    "( such as @xmath129 ) , the nernst coefficient @xmath12 peaks sharply near the dirac point at low temperatures .",
    "because on two sides of the dirac point , the carriers are electron - like and hole - like and they are shifted to the opposite direction under the weak magnetic field , the nernst effect is largest at the dirac point .    in particular , in the setup-6i",
    ", the nernst coefficient @xmath12 is very large at the dirac point , which is much larger than that in setup-6ii and in the case of high magnetic field .",
    "because for the setup-6i , the longitudinal leads ( lead-1 and lead-3 ) are metallic with a large transmission coefficient but the transverse leads ( lead-2 and lead-4 ) are almost insulator near the dirac point . as a result , we have to add a much larger bias to balance the thermal current so that the nernst coefficient @xmath12 is very large in the setup-6i at the low magnetic field ( see fig.6(a1 ) and ( b1 ) ) . with increasing of @xmath11 ,",
    "lls are formed one by one .",
    "the zeroth ll located at the dirac point is formed first ( at about @xmath130 , no shown ) , then is the first ll , the second and so on .",
    "for example , in fig.6(a ) , no ll is formed while in fig.6(b ) , the zeroth , first and second ll are formed .",
    "as soon as lls are formed , the nernst coefficient @xmath12 will satisfy the relation that its peak heights are equal to @xmath109 ( or @xmath106 for @xmath1 ) . from fig.6(c ) , we can see that as @xmath131 , electrons ( or holes ) with fermi energy @xmath132 all belong to robust edge states . in this case , the nernst coefficient @xmath12 are almost the same for the setup-6i and setup-6ii .    for the seebeck effect , armchair edge ribbon",
    "can either be metal or insulator , we also consider three different systems as in the case of zero magnetic field . in fig.7",
    "we plot the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 versus @xmath10 at different temperatures and magnetic fields for three different systems .",
    "the first column is for the zigzag edge ribbon with width @xmath105 , the second column is for metallic armchair edge ribbon with @xmath105 , and the third column is for insulating armchair edge ribbon with @xmath133 . from fig.7(a ) to fig.7(c ) , the magnetic field increases gradually .",
    "we can see that in the weak magnetic field , the peaks of @xmath9 are still regularly distributed for the zigzag ribbon and are irregular for the armchair ribbon due to the different band structure for the zigzag edge and armchair edge ribbon . moreover , for the insulating armchair edge ribbon",
    ", the energy gap near dirac point is diminished because of the magnetic field @xmath11 , the very high and sharp @xmath9 at @xmath112 ( see fig.5 ) is gradually dropped with the increasing of @xmath11 .",
    "but at the weak magnetic field @xmath129 , the @xmath12 can still reach 3 ( see fig.7(a3 ) ) , which is much larger than all peaks of @xmath9 in the high magnetic field case .",
    "similar to fig.6 , with the increasing of @xmath11 further , the lls is gradually formed from dirac point to the high @xmath10 , the the properties of @xmath9 for three systems gradually tend to the same . at the high magnetic field @xmath131 , lls are completely formed for @xmath134 , then seebeck coefficient @xmath9 for three different systems are all the same to that in the hall region .",
    "in summary , by using the landauer - b@xmath27ttiker formula combining with the non - equilibrium green s function method , the nernst effect in the crossed graphene ribbon and the seebeck effect in the single graphene ribbon are investigated .",
    "it is found that due to the electron - hole symmetry , the nernst coefficient @xmath12 is an even function while the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 is an odd function of the fermi energy @xmath10 . @xmath12 and @xmath9 show peaks when @xmath10 crosses the landau levels at high magnetic fields or crosses the transverse sub - bands at the zero magnetic field . in the strong magnetic field , due to",
    "the fact that high degenerated landau levels dominate transport processes the nernst and seebeck coefficients are similar for different chirality ribbons .",
    "the peak height of @xmath12 and @xmath9 , respectively , are @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath135 $ ] with the peak number @xmath0 , except for @xmath1 . for zeroth peak",
    ", it is abnormal .",
    "its peak height is @xmath4 $ ] for the nernst effect and it disappears for the seebeck effect . while in zero magnetic field , nernst effect is absent and the seebeck effect is strongly dependent on the chirality of the ribbon .",
    "for the zigzag edge ribbon , the peaks of @xmath9 are equidistance , but they are irregularly distributed for armchair edge ribbon . surprisingly , for the insulating armchair edge ribbon , the seebeck coefficient @xmath9 can be very large near the dirac point due to the energy gap . when the magnetic field increases from zero to high values , the irregularly or regularly distributed peaks of @xmath9 in different chiral ribbons gradually tends to be the same .",
    "in addition , the nonzero values of the nernst coefficient @xmath12 appear first near the dirac point and then gradually in the whole energy region .",
    "it is remarkable that for certain crossed ribbons , the nernst coefficient @xmath12 at weak magnetic fields can be much larger than that in the strong magnetic field due to small transmission coefficient in the transverse terminals .",

    "<S> the thermoelectric power , including the nernst and seebeck effects , in graphene nanoribbon is studied . by using the non - equilibrium green function combining with the tight - binding hamiltonian , the nernst and seebeck coefficients are obtained . due to the electron - hole symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , the nernst coefficient is an even function of the fermi energy while the seebeck coefficient is an odd function regardless of the magnetic field . in the presence of a strong magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> the nernst and seebeck coefficients are almost independent of the chirality and width of the nanoribbon , and they show peaks when the fermi energy crosses the landau levels . the height of @xmath0-th ( excluding @xmath1 ) peak is @xmath2 $ ] for the nernst effect and is @xmath3 for the seebeck effect . for the zeroth peak </S>",
    "<S> , it is abnormal with height @xmath4 $ ] for the nernst effect and the peak disappears for the seebeck effect . when the magnetic field is turned off , however , the nernst effect is absent and only seebeck effect exists . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the seebeck coefficient strongly depends on the chirality of the nanoribbon . </S>",
    "<S> the peaks are equidistant for the nanoribbons with zigzag edge but are irregularly distributed for the armchair edge . in particular , for the insulating armchair ribbon , the seebeck coefficient can be very large near the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> when the magnetic field varies from zero to large values , the differences among the seebeck coefficients for different chiral ribbons gradually vanish and the nonzero value of nernst coefficient appears first near the dirac point then gradually extents to the whole energy region . </S>"
