    "quantum information science  @xcite has made rapid progress recently with scalable architectures proposed for atom based qubits through the ion - trap schemes  @xcite and for photonic qubits through the linear optical quantum computing  @xcite and cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite schemes , along with various other proposals for quantum logic operations for atomic  @xcite , photonic  @xcite and hybrid  @xcite qubits .",
    "two - qubit quantum logic operations require interaction between the physical entities used for encoding the qubits .",
    "physical systems provide natural grounds for implementations of two - qubit operations as there are plenty of cases providing controllable interaction between two entities .",
    "however , direct multiqubit operations require controllable interactions between more than two entities at a time that are difficult to come by .",
    "thus , the decomposition of multiqubit gates into their two - qubit and single - qubit counterparts is an essential step in quantum circuit design and implementations .",
    "moreover , majority of the two - body interactions have a spatially dependent interaction strength .",
    "thus , in most cases only near - neighbor interactions are available .    to this end , we note that it is possible to induce interaction between atoms coupled collectively to the cavity vacuum  @xcite .",
    "this interaction has been shown to be useful to perform quantum logic operations by gbris and agarwal  @xcite in the case of two level atoms trapped inside a cavity .",
    "here we recognize that the interaction induced between the atoms through their common coupling with the cavity vacuum is essentially independent of the distance between the atoms .",
    "we employ the long - range nature of this interaction and develop a scheme to allow any two atoms from a chain of trapped neutral atoms to interact with each other .",
    "this interaction is then exploited to perform quantum logic operations between any two qubits .",
    "our model employs metastable atomic states as qubits , thus , qubit decoherence is not an issue .",
    "moreover , the atom - cavity coupling is dispersive in nature ; therefore , cavity does not contain any real photons at any stage of the interaction .",
    "thus , the cavity decay becomes a non - issue as well .",
    "it is well known that multiqubit quantum logic operations can be achieved through a sequence of single qubit and two - qubit gates ( e.g. , controlled - not ( cnot ) and controlled - sign ( c - sign ) gates )  @xcite .",
    "thus , our scheme can be easily extended to perform multiqubit operations .",
    "in fact , as we show later , the quantum circuits for the multiqubit quantum operations as they are usually drawn , which involves several non - neighbor qubit operations , can be directly implemented through of a sequence of operations using our non - local scheme .",
    "it is also instructive to recollect that an important hurdle for scalability has been identified for the ion - trap quantum computing proposals  @xcite .",
    "namely , physical motion of ions is required to ensure proximity among the qubits for the two - qubit logic operation .",
    "this dictates tremendous speed constraints on the current ion - trap quantum computer architecture .",
    "very recently tian _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a hybrid qubit approach , by coupling the ion - trap qubits with the superconducting ones , to cure this pathology of trapped - ion systems .",
    "nevertheless , introduction of non - neighbor interactions would provide tremendous speed - up for the trapped ion proposals .",
    "furthermore , devising simple strategies for implementation of the error correcting codes  @xcite is essential , especially , in the context that the experimental demonstration has been possible only for a three - bit code  @xcite so far .",
    "the article is organized as follows . as we are proposing a non - neighbor interaction for quantum logic operations we present a simple analysis of how many operations",
    "are required in the conventional setting to carry out a non - local cnot gate between the first and the @xmath0th qubit from a set of total @xmath0 qubits .",
    "next , we present how distance - independent interaction can be induced between any two qubits from a chain having a number of them .",
    "we give a set of operations required to perform the quantum phase gate operation such that the non - local nature is maintained .",
    "then , we clarify advantages offered by our scheme and contrast it with several other quantum logic schemes for the ionic and neutral atom qubits",
    ". finally we present our conclusions . in the appendices we provide calculational details leading to the quantum logic operations .",
    "to emphasize the speed - up obtainable through non - neighbor interactions we revisit the design of multiqubit quantum logic gates through a sequence of single qubit unitary transformations and two - qubit operations .",
    "for example , we consider the circuit representation of the three - qubit toffoli gate in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath1 in terms of the cnot gates and single qubit unitary transformations , @xmath2 it needs at least two non - neighbor cnot gates . in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath3 we consider a five - bit error correction network  @xcite .",
    "it needs multiple interactions of each encoding qubit with the ancilla , therefore with only near - neighbor interactions there would be a dramatic increase in the number of operations needed for its implementation .    to quantify the number of extra operations required per non - neighbor two - qubit gate we consider an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath4 showing a decomposition of non - neighbor cnot operations through multiple near - neighbor cnot operations . thus , to perform a non - neighbor two qubit gate between the first and third qubit from a set of total three qubits the optimal sequence of operations ( as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath4 ) requires three more operations .",
    "it turns out , however , that this strategy is not optimal if it is extended in a straightforward manner to a set of total @xmath0 qubits for performing two qubit operation between the first and the @xmath0th qubit .",
    "the optimal strategy , using only local or near - neighbor interactions , is obtained by swapping the @xmath0 the qubit with the ` @xmath5 ' th qubit , then swapping the ` @xmath5 ' th qubit with the ` @xmath6 ' th one and so on till the state of the @xmath0th qubit is transferred to the @xmath7nd qubit.a simple calculation shows that this swapping operation requires @xmath6 operations .",
    "then the two qubit cnot could be performed between the near - neighbor first and second qubits .",
    "once again @xmath6 swap operations would be needed to bring back the new state of the second qubit to the @xmath0th qubit where it belongs .",
    "it is also known that a single swap operation requires three cnot operations .",
    "thus , to perform a two - qubit non - local gate between the first and the @xmath0th qubit one requires @xmath8 extra operations .",
    "it has to be borne in mind , however , that each swap operation has to be completely error - free otherwise the above procedure would introduce tremendous amount of uncorrectable errors .",
    "thus , one needs each cnot operation implemented in a fault - tolerant manner , which would require , at the least say , ten error - correcting operations per cnot gate .",
    "thus , actual number of operations require would be @xmath9 operations . to illustrate , for a moderate number of qubits , say ten , total 480 extra operations would be needed just to perform a single two - qubit gate between the first and the tenth qubit .",
    "in the above calculation we have assumed that the error correcting network needed to perform a single cnot in a fault - tolerant manner does not require any non - local operations .",
    "however , it can be easily seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath3 that this is not the case .",
    "thus , the actual number of operations would be much higher than @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , as the complexity of the quantum circuit increases , more and more non - neighbor interactions would be needed and schemes based on conventional approach would be very slow at best and very error - prone at worst . moreover , the number of operations needed to perform a single non - neighbor gate between the first and the last qubit would increase with the system size in the conventional setting .",
    "therefore , the advantage offered by efficient non - local interaction can not be overemphasized .        just to note , the single qubit operations of eq .",
    "can be attained through properly timed raman pulses coupling the two qubit - levels @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; this is routinely done in cavity - qed systems .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to the non - neighbor quantum phase gate operation .",
    "in the discussion to follow we describe our scheme in detail and show how distance- independent interaction can be introduced between a pair of atoms through their common interaction with the cavity vacuum .    to accomplish scalable architecture it should be possible to perform two - qubit operations with equal ease in the presence of other qubits .",
    "to illustrate , having only two - level systems as qubits interacting dispersively with the cavity field as considered by gbris _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , one needs twice as many operations to accomplish two qubit gate in the presence of an extra atom in the cavity as this third atom also takes part in the collective interaction .",
    "therefore we employ collective coupling with the cavity with the choice of turning on the interaction as needed instead of having it on at all times .",
    "we consider a linear array of @xmath0 atoms placed in a cavity .",
    "we note that the cavity supports standing wave field with spatially dependent field amplitude .",
    "therefore , it is important to trap atoms such that they all see the same field strength .",
    "such an architecture can be achieved using the proposals for trapping atoms inside optical cavities  @xcite , through the marriage of ion trap and cavity - qed systems  @xcite or in the chain of neutral atoms trapped in standing wave fields  @xcite .",
    "the atoms are assumed to be identical and have a four - level internal structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .     scheme for the non - neighbor two - qubit quantum phase gate with cavity mediated interaction .",
    "the cavity mode is coupled to the @xmath12 transition for all the atoms with detuning @xmath13 . the external drive fields couple different atomic states as per the hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "the external coupling could be direct or through raman pulses as discussed in the context of eq .  .",
    "the dormant atoms maintain their general state @xmath14 while quantum logic operation is being performed on the control and target atoms .",
    "the atomic energy levels @xmath15 and @xmath11 are shown to be degenerate just for convenience .",
    "this is not a requirement for the success of the proposal . ]",
    "the states forming qubits could be taken as hyperfine sublevels of an electronic states or two states of a single hyperfine manifold .",
    "the preparation of the qubit state can be accomplished through efficient mixing of the well developed optical pumping and adiabatic population transfer techniques .",
    "the states representing the qubit are chosen so that they do not directly interact with the cavity field . however",
    ", each atom has an extra pair of levels that can interact with the cavity field .",
    "thus , once the @xmath16th , and @xmath17th atoms are brought into these levels they interact with the cavity field through the hamiltonian @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the levels of atom @xmath16 close to resonance with the cavity field also , @xmath21 is the cavity mode annihilation operator and @xmath22 is the coupling strength of the atomic transition with the cavity field . here",
    "the free hamiltonian is @xmath23 including only the relevant atomic energy levels .",
    "the atomic energies ( @xmath24 ) are measured with respect to the ground state , @xmath25 , of the atoms . here",
    "the position dependence of the rabi frequency and the atomic dipole operators is not shown as the atomic positions ( for example , anti - nodes of the standing wave field of the cavity ) are chosen such that all atoms see the same cavity field strength . by including the position dependence of the cavity field and the atomic dipoles , this hamiltonian   becomes tunable and can be employed for simulation of the quantum spin systems  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the cavity field is not directly resonant with the @xmath26 transitions and it is coupled only dispersively . therefore , the cavity field is in its vacuum state and the atom does not get excited by the cavity field or if it is in the excited state it does not emit photon in the cavity mode .",
    "thus , through adiabatic elimination of the states corresponding to the presence of photons in the cavity mode we arrive at the effective interaction hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , and @xmath13 is the cavity field detuning with respect to the atomic transition .",
    "we have assumed @xmath29 for arriving at this result .",
    "the first term leads to trivial phase factors that can be corrected in a straightforward manner and the last two terms lead to coupling between the atom through virtual exchange of a cavity photon .",
    "thus , the cavity vacuum effectively induces interaction between two atoms , immaterial of their spatial position provided they both see the same cavity field strength .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction usually falls of as inverse sixth power of the distance between the dipoles .",
    "whereas , the interaction induced between the atomic dipoles through the cavity vacuum is independent of the distance between them .",
    "this long - range interaction can be employed to perform non - local quantum logic operations .",
    "in this section we provide the set of operations needed to accomplish direct two - qubit operation between any of the two qubits from a linear array of @xmath0-qubits .",
    "we note that , the two qubit cnot gate can be decomposed into hadamard transformations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath30 , and matrix @xmath31 from eq .  ) on the target qubit and a c - sign gate between the two qubits .",
    "therefore , we only resort to implementing the c - sign gate operation given by @xmath32 the calculational details are given in appendix b at length and the choice of the operations steps taken is justified .",
    "now we analyze several possible initial states of the atoms and their interaction with the cavity field .",
    "the results are summarized below : it can be seen that the states @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 remain unaffected by the cavity - field . here",
    "state @xmath36 corresponds to some arbitrary atomic level @xmath37 that does not interact with the cavity field . also if the interaction time is taken to be @xmath38 , the states @xmath39 and @xmath40 return to their original atomic configurations , and the states @xmath41 and @xmath42 acquire a phase factor of @xmath43 .",
    "another important ingradient necessary for our proposal is selective addressing of the atoms . to achieve this we consider a general interaction hamiltonian @xmath44.\\ ] ] describing application of external optical fields on certain atomic transitions",
    "here the rabi frequencies could be directing couplings between the involved levels or they could be composite rabi frequencies of a couple of raman pulses coupling the involved levels through intermediate levels @xmath45 . in the composite case",
    "the rabi frequencies can be written as @xmath46 here @xmath47 denotes the rabi frequency of interaction of levels @xmath17 and @xmath48 with the corresponding light field applied with detuning @xmath49 or @xmath50 on the @xmath51 transition .",
    "it can be noted that , the composite raman pulses are routinely used in the ion - trap quantum logic gates .",
    "we note that , complete transfer of population , @xmath52 , can be accomplished through an application of a pulse with parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the inverse operation , @xmath55 , with @xmath53 and @xmath56 .",
    "similar considerstions hold for the pulse with rabi frequency @xmath57 resonant on the @xmath58 transition of the control atom .",
    "the details of why a specific phase of the rabi frequency is necessary to achieve population transfer is discussed in appendix a.      1 .",
    "operation @xmath59 on both the target and control atoms through a pulse of rabi frequency @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "operation @xmath63 through a pulse of rabi frequency @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 to move the control qubit to the excited state interacting with the cavity .",
    "3 .   interaction of the control and target atoms with the cavity for the time @xmath67 .",
    "operation @xmath68 , to bring back the qubit state of the control qubit , through the same pulse as in step 2 except for the phase @xmath69 .",
    "operation @xmath70 on both control and target via the same pulse of step 1 , and the phase @xmath71 .",
    "we note that , steps ( 1,5 ) and ( 2,4 ) can be accomplished via appropriate terms in eq .  .",
    "the effect of these operations on various initial states of the two - qubits is summarized at length in table  [ table ] . by choosing the interaction time @xmath72 with the cavity vacuum mode such that",
    "@xmath38 , the desired two - qubit c - sign gate operation is obtained .    the fidelity calculation for the above model of the two qubit gate",
    "is summarized in appendix c. our numerical studies show a gate fidelity of 99% , with the cavity decay ( @xmath73 ) , the spontaneous decay of level @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and the detuning ( @xmath13 ) taken to be @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively . for experimental cavity parameters  @xcite ( @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ) , a modest @xmath81 and @xmath82 we obtain a fidelity of 93% .",
    "once again we would like to point out that all the states @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath83 and @xmath74 for all the atoms could be taken to be metastable and the external coupling achieved through eq .",
    "[ eq : exthamiltonian ] could be achieved through raman pulses .",
    "therefore , atomic decoherence is not an issue .",
    "we have provided above fidelity calculations just for completeness .",
    "in such a case the atomic transition @xmath84 could be taken in the microwave range .",
    "the scheme could very well be applicable in the optical range , one only needs an appropriate metastable level @xmath74 so that decoherence does not remain an issue .    to come back to the gate operations , employing hadamard transformation , @xmath31 from eq .",
    ", on the target qubit before and after the c - sign gate , one obtains a cnot gate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath30 .",
    "combining several of these cnot gates as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuits]@xmath1 and @xmath3 , the three - qubit toffoli gate and five - bit error - correcting network can be directly constructed .",
    ".[table]two - qubit non - neighbor c - sign gate operation : the effect of step 3 on the state @xmath85 is non - trivial and it leads to the state @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "thus , with the choice of @xmath38 it becomes as @xmath85 as shown below .",
    "moreover , the state @xmath87 acquires a phase factor @xmath88 under step 3 . it can be noted that the first and the last column taken together correspond to the truth table of the c - sign gate .",
