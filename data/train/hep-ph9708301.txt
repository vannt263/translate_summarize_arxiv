    "it is by now well established that the measurements of the solar neutrino flux on earth fall short of the expectations based on solar models .",
    "the question of whether this deficit can be proven to be energy - dependent is of primary importance in neutrino physics .",
    "in fact , if this were the case and ascribing the effect to oscillations , this would imply the existence of a @xmath3 smaller than @xmath4 ev@xmath5 .",
    "a careful statistical analysis of all the available evidence was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite with the conclusion that the data are consistent with an energy - independent depletion of the solar neutrino flux due to vacuum oscillations .",
    "other authors @xcite have also taken this viewpoint .",
    "however , different results have been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and more recently in ref .",
    "in particular , in this last paper , it is claimed that `` an energy independent suppression of the solar neutrino spectrum as a result of neutrino oscillation / transitions into active neutrinos or antineutrinos is ruled out by the data from the four operating experiments at 99.96 % c.l . ''",
    "two opposite conclusions can not be both right . to investigate the origin of this disagreement , we have retraced the steps of the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , starting from the same input data detailed in sect .  [ indata ] .",
    "we can reproduce all results up to the final value of the minimum @xmath6 , but we find that the confidence level for an energy - independent depletion of the solar neutrino flux is still acceptable , in agreement with our previous results @xcite . a possible explanation for this discrepancy is discussed in sect .  [ oversight ] .",
    "we present our final conclusions in sect .",
    "in order to make our comparison as tight as possible , we have used exactly the same input data as those of ref .",
    "the experimental results originate from ref  @xcite , the predictions of the `` reference '' standard solar model from ref .",
    "they are reported in table 1 .",
    "an update of the experimental information is presented in sect .",
    "[ conc ] .    the uncertainties on the theoretical predictions are obviously correlated .",
    "however , at least for the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the information available allows @xcite to calculate the relevant correlation matrix @xmath7 reported in table 2 .    within the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath8 for the hypothesis of an oscillation - induced energy - independent reduction of all predictions is then simply written as @xmath9 where :    * the indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 run over the `` four operating experiments '' ; * @xmath12 are the experimental results ; * @xmath13 are the theoretical expectations . for the gallium ( ga ) , chlorine ( cl ) and kamiokande ( ka ) experiments",
    "they are obtained from the results @xmath14 of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite through the relations @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy - independent depletion factor and @xmath17 = 0.155 is the fraction of the kamiokande detection efficiency due to flavour - blind neutral currents ; * @xmath18 is the covariance matrix . with exactly the same procedure as above , the errors on the theoretical expectations @xmath19",
    "are obtained from the estimates of the solar model uncertainties @xmath20 through the relations @xmath21 + they give rise to the solar - model - related part of the covariance matrix through the relations @xmath22 in which @xmath23 are the elements of the correlation matrix reported in table 2 .",
    "the complete @xmath18 is then finally obtained by adding in quadrature the experimental errors @xmath24 to the diagonal elements : @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath24 are in turn obtained by adding in quadrature statistical and instrumental errors .",
    "when asymmetric errors are given , the average values have been used .",
    "the minimum value of the function @xmath26 is @xmath27 = 13.5 corresponding to the result @xmath28 , in excellent agreement with the value @xmath27 = 13.0 quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the corresponding confidence level ( cl ) for @xmath29 = 3 ( 4 data points minus 1 unknown parameter ) degrees of freedom is 0.36 % .",
    "1 shows the plot of cl = cl(@xmath8 ) for different values of @xmath29 .",
    "the value @xmath27 = 13.0 found in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to a cl = 0.46 % .",
    "we find no justification for the low value ( cl = @xmath30 ) invoked to reject the energy - independent - depletion hypothesis .    a possible explanation that we venture to put forward lies in the fact that in fig .",
    "1 a vertical line at @xmath8 = 13.0 intercepts the @xmath31 curve in the range @xmath32 cl @xmath33 .",
    "so it is perhaps plausible that the confidence level of ref .",
    "@xcite was calculated for the wrong number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath31 instead of @xmath34 ) .",
    "the validity of a @xmath8 analysis relies on the two basic hypotheses that errors must be correctly calculated and gaussian - distributed . neither is really justified in the case of solar neutrinos .      on the theoretical side , different models of the same sun giving rise to different predictions",
    "can not be all simultaneously right , implying that the quoted errors are probably underestimated . in some cases",
    "the assumption of a gaussian probability density function is highly questionable and this in turn implies the likelihood of an underestimated variance .",
    "for all these reasons , the @xmath8 approach can not be taken too seriously far away from the minimum where small deviations from a gaussian behaviour in the tails of the probability density functions give rise to huge variations of the confidence level .",
    "however , even discarding all these caveats , no serious disagreement with the energy - independent - depletion hypothesis can be claimed to exist at present . making use of the recent and more precise measurement of the solar neutrino flux by the superkamiokande experiment , @xmath35 @xmath36 s@xmath37 @xcite , yields @xmath27 = 14.2 , corresponding to @xmath38 and cl = 0.26 % .",
    "the confidence levels are small , but not unacceptably small .    to gauge the acceptability of the cl obtained , it is perhaps worth remembering that `` if this probability is larger than an agreed - upon value ( 0.001 , 0.01 , or 0.05 are common choices )",
    ", the data are _ consistent _ with the assumptions ; otherwise we may want to find improved assumptions .",
    "as for the converse , most people do not regard a model as truly _ inconsistent _ unless the probability is as low as that corresponding to four or five standard deviations for a gaussian @xmath39 or @xmath40 '' @xcite .",
    "the onus of the proof is on the energy - dependence camp .",
    "as no definitive proof of the correctness of this hypothesis has been produced so far , the energy - dependence of the solar neutrino deficit must be regarded , at least for the time being , as just an attractive theoretical possibility , but not as a compelling reality .",
