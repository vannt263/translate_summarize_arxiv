    "giant resonances can be described as coherent superpositions of particle - hole excitations and their particle decays into given hole channels provide insight about the corresponding particle - hole amplitudes .",
    "thus , the study of decay properties is a unique way to test model predictions for the resonance wave function .",
    "experimental studies have recently been made of the particle decay properties of giant resonances by means of exclusive measurements where inelastically scattered projectiles , or light products of transfer reactions , are detected in coincidence with nucleons emitted by giant resonances of the target system .",
    "the corresponding results provide severe tests for the theoretical models .",
    "the gamow - teller resonance ( gtr ) is the manifestation of the spin - isospin nuclear zero sound .",
    "this mode was predicted theoretically as the mechanism for explaining the missing strength in the decay of @xmath3-radioactive nuclei @xcite .",
    "its subsequent observation in ( p , n ) reactions has opened an important chapter of the historical development of experimental study of giant resonances when the availability of higher energy projectiles in the early 80 s led to the realization of reaction conditions under which spin - isospin modes can optimally be excited @xcite . a first experiment aimed to study the proton decay of the gtr",
    "was performed in groningen , and reported in ref .",
    "the results of this measurement raised a number of questions , as they seemed to imply a vanishing spreading width for the gtr , which seems quite unlikely .",
    "renewed interest in the study of the properties of the gtr is indeed testified by two recent measurements , with different characteristics , at osaka and msu .",
    "the proton decay of the resonance in @xmath2bi has been investigated , and in the osaka experiment @xcite , the results appear in modest agreement with previous theoretical estimates given in refs . @xcite and @xcite , whereas preliminary indications from the msu experiment seem to give a somewhat different result @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the present work , in which we apply to the charge - exchange modes a model of giant resonances which includes in a self - consistent way the coupling mechanisms leading to the damping of these modes .",
    "this model has been already used to study the properties of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in @xmath2pb @xcite .",
    "we have first concentrated , as a test case , on the isobaric analog resonance ( iar ) in the nucleus @xmath2bi where the data provides a clear picture of the resonance properties .",
    "the iar would be degenerate with its isobaric multiplet partner , the ground state of @xmath2pb , if the nuclear hamiltonian were completely charge- independent .",
    "the energy difference , due mainly to coulomb effects , has been studied over a long period of time and it is accurately known .",
    "the width of the iar is known to be very small .",
    "this is because it has the same isospin as the parent state while surrounding states have the isospin of the ground state of @xmath2bi , which differs by one unit .",
    "consequently , they couple only weakly with the iar .",
    "thus , excitation energy and width of this resonance provide a stringent test for any theoretical model of charge - exchange collective states .    we shall show how this test has been passed by our model in sec .",

    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) provides , as a rule , an accurate description of the centroid of giant resonances and the fraction of the energy weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) exhausted by the mode .",

    "we present a model in which a phenomenological effective interaction of the skyrme type is used as the starting point but after this _ no further tuning of the parameters _ is introduced up to final results .",
    "we start by solving the hartree - fock ( hf ) set of equations for a given nucleus @xmath4 using a skyrme two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "a set of occupied single - particle levels is then obtained , as well as a self - consistent mean field , which is then diagonalized on a basis made up with harmonic oscillator wave functions .",
    "this diagonalization procedure can also be replaced by solving the hf mean field with a box boundary condition .",
    "it provides a discrete set of occupied and unoccupied levels , many of which are at positive energy .",
    "the quasi - bound levels belong to this set . after choosing a convenient cutoff - details about numerical procedures",
    "are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : chex ] - a finite set of occupied and unoccupied levels labeled by @xmath5 is determined . in the following , we denote the corresponding energies and wave functions by @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( the radial part of the wave function will be expressed as @xmath8 ) .",
    "let us call @xmath9 the subspace of nuclear configurations made up with the hf ground state and all the possible one particle - one hole ( 1p-1h ) excitations built within the set @xmath5 .",
    "we shall denote by the same symbol subspaces and projectors onto them .",
    "now , the nuclear hamiltonian can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hf hamiltonian and @xmath12 is the particle - hole ( ph ) interaction determined as the functional derivative of the self - consistent mean field with respect to the density . the usual tamm - dancoff approximation ( tda ) or rpa in a discrete particle - hole space amount to solve tda or rpa equations using the hamiltonian @xmath13 .    as said above ,",
    "giant resonances are known to have a decay width , and we can distinguish two main mechanisms which give rise to it . the energy of the vibrational nuclear motion can be transferred out of the system by an escaping nucleon - ray can escape when selection rules allow it to do . in what follows we neglect this decay channel as it gives a minor contribution to the total width of the mode .",
    "] , or can be distributed among internal degrees of freedom giving rise to more complicated configurations than the initial configuration .",
    "the contributions to the width coming from these two damping effects are usually called respectively escape ( @xmath14 ) and spreading ( @xmath15 ) width .",
    "we must also mention another source of broadening of the line width , namely the landau spreading which already appears at the level of discrete rpa or tda calculations .    in order to account for escape and spreading effects ,",
    "we build two other subspaces @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the space @xmath16 is made up with particle - hole configurations where the particle is in an unbound state , orthogonal to all states @xmath5 . to determine these unbound states , we use the following procedure . at positive energy @xmath18",
    "we solve , for each partial wave @xmath19 , the radial scattering equation for @xmath11 , projected on the orthogonal complement of set @xmath5 .",
    "we can thus ensure that the resulting outgoing wave functions @xmath20 have no overlap with any of the states @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath16 and @xmath9 are orthogonal subspaces ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the states @xmath20 have no resonant behaviour since quasi - bound states are among the states @xmath5 .    the space @xmath17 is built with a set of `` doorway states '' , the first step in the coupling of the ordered resonance motion with the compound nuclear states , in which energy is distributed among all degrees of freedom in a statistical way .",
    "we denote these `` doorway states '' by @xmath21 . as a first approximation we can think of them as formed by 2p-2h configurations , but we discuss later a more physical choice of them in terms of states made up with one of the 1p-1h excitations coupled to a collective vibration .",
    "we decompose the nuclear green s function @xmath22 as a sum of terms like @xmath23 . using the technique described in @xcite one",
    "can show that by virtue of the equations of motion in the different subspaces and the properties of projectors , the green s function @xmath24 obeys an equation where the effective hamiltonian , after truncation of higher order couplings , is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the excitation energy .",
    "this energy - dependent , complex hamitonian allows to work inside the space @xmath9 .",
    "it has complex eigenvalues whose imaginary parts originate from coupling to unbound and to more complicated configurations and give rise to escape and spreading widths .",
    "the escape term @xmath27 can be more easily evaluated if one replaces the complete hamiltonian @xmath28 by the one - body part @xmath11 .",
    "the neglect of matrix elements of @xmath29 should be , in the present case , rather safe since discrete and continuum wave functions are essentially restricted to different radial intervals while @xmath12 interaction has zero range . in this approximation ,",
    "the escape term can be written @xcite as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the inverse inside subspace @xmath9 of the green s function containing only the mean field hamiltonian .",
    "this green s function can be easily computed and inverted as it has only one - body matrix elements whereas taking into account the two - body interaction would have resulted in a much harder task .",
    "detailed expressions are given in appendix a. the accuracy of the procedure has been checked in @xcite , where the results obtained for the isoscalar monopole strength distribution in @xmath32ca , by using the approximate @xmath33 of ( [ appr_wup ] ) , were compared with those of exact continuum - rpa calculations and excellent agreement between the two calculations was found ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "yoshida and adachi made a similar comparison in @xcite and they concluded also that a good agreement can be obtained , provided a sufficiently large basis is employed ( see figs .",
    "1 - 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the matrix elements on a basis of @xmath9 can be also determined in a straightforward way for the spreading term @xmath34 .",
    "we make the ansatz that the configurations @xmath21 of @xmath17 are not interacting-10@xmath35 levels per mev in the region of giant resonances if we think in terms of 2p-2h configurations @xcite , so that to calculate their mutual interaction would be a formidable task . ] .",
    "this is reasonable since coupling among doorway states will correct the coupling between 1p-1h states and doorway states in higher order of the residual interaction .",
    "if we take a basis of ph configurations , i.e. , a set @xmath36 ( particle levels are labeled by @xmath37 , and hole levels by @xmath38 ) , then the generic matrix element turns out to be @xmath39 where we have omitted the subscript @xmath40 of the interaction , and @xmath41 is the energy of the state @xmath21 , in mean field approximation .",
    "further clarifications about the evaluation of ( [ me_wdown ] ) are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : chex ] .",
    "it is found convenient , in order to solve the effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) , to work on the basis of the rpa or tda states obtained by diagonalizing its first term .",
    "using this basis , we provide explicit formulas for the matrix elements of the escape and spreading terms in appendix a. in this matrix form , the eigenvalue equation for the effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a diagonal matrix with the rpa eigenvalues , and the @xmath44 matrices which are energy dependent contain the escape and spreading contributions , as explained in appendix a. we have omitted the energy dependence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in ( [ eig ] ) , for sake of simplicity in the notation , and we have collectively denoted respectively with @xmath45 and @xmath46 the amplitudes corresponding to positive and negative rpa eigenstates .",
    "the solutions of ( [ eig ] ) are denoted by @xmath47 , whereas the rpa basis vectors are labelled by @xmath48 , according to @xmath49 it is worthwhile at this point to notice that an approach based on tda instead of rpa leads to an equation in which only the upper - left quarter of the matrix that appears in ( [ eig ] ) is present .",
    "the matrix which appears in ( [ eig ] ) is complex symmetric as can be seen from its explicit form in appendix a ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the transformation which makes it diagonal , that is the matrix of its eigenvectors , is complex orthogonal , that is @xmath50 a useful quantity characterizing a mode excited by a given operator @xmath51 is the response function , @xmath52 the corresponding strength function is related to ( [ resp ] ) by the well known relation @xmath53 in terms of solutions of ( [ eig ] ) the strength function is @xmath54 where the squared matrix element of @xmath51 appears , instead of its squared modulus , due to the properties of the eigenvectors @xmath47 , which form a biorthogonal basis .",
    "we stress at this point that , although not explicitly written , the eigenvalues labeled by @xmath55 as well as the wave functions needed to compute the matrix elements of @xmath51 depend on @xmath26 , as the effective hamiltonian does .",
    "so , better than the eigenvalue distribution , which can change when diagonalizing the effective hamiltonian at different energies , the strength function really carries information about the couplings taken into account , and can be directly compared with experimental results .",
    "note also that , when all the above scheme is carried out without @xmath17 space , one should recover continuum rpa results .",

    "( [ bc ] ) is a _ real _ quantity .",
    "the strength functions and the branching ratios are the main quantities we are going to show as results of the present model and which can be directly confronted with experiment . before coming to this , we add some important remarks relevant to calculations of charge - exchange resonances .",
    "the model we have just presented was used in its tda version and without the inclusion of the spreading term @xmath68 to calculate the iar and gtr in @xmath2bi @xcite .",
    "details about the hf and tda procedures as well as the coupling with continuum configurations can be found in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of the spreading term is an improvement of the model .",
    "moreover , this term was never included in previous calculations of the iar in the form of coupling with collective vibrations , as it is done here .",
    "while coupling to collective vibrations has been used for the gtr ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , the iar case has only been treated by using for @xmath21 the 2p-2h configurations to build @xmath68 ( @xcite ) . in the present work ,",
    "we want to use the same model to construct the @xmath68 term for iar and gtr , and therefore isospin conservation rules must be carefully treated as discussed at the end of this sec .",
    "we have consistently used the two interactions siii and sgii throughout the whole procedure .",
    "the hf mean field for @xmath2pb is diagonalized on a basis of 15 shells of the set of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions with @xmath69=6.2 mev ( see also @xcite ) . for the construction of subspace @xmath9 ,",
    "the set @xmath5 contains all occupied levels and @xmath70 unoccupied proton levels for each value of @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath70 is 6 in the iar case , and 7 in the gtr case , as in @xcite .",
    "the difference with this previous work is the inclusion in the present case of the coulomb exchange term in the slater approximation inside the hf mean field .",
    "we have then performed a tda calculation within @xmath9 , as the large neutron excess of @xmath2pb should hinder ground - state correlations effects for proton particle - neutron hole configurations .",
    "this gives the basis of states @xmath48 on which eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) is solved .",
    "we have built the configurations of subspace @xmath17 by coupling a proton particle and a neutron hole in the discrete states of the set @xmath5 with collective vibrations of the @xmath2pb core .",
    "these doorway states , introduced above and labeled by @xmath21 play an essential role in the damping of giant resonances . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the reason is that the choice of 2p-2h as doorway states amounts to neglect a number of correlations induced by the residual interaction @xmath12 .",
    "many of these correlations are included if the low - lying collective vibrations are explicitly taken into account as doorway states .",
    "the collective vibrations of the nucleus @xmath2pb have been calculated in self - consistent rpa , with the same siii or sgii interaction used throughout the whole work , in a way completely analogous to @xcite , where the coupling with collective vibrations was used to study the energies and spectroscopic factors of single - particle states .",
    "we refer then for details to @xcite , summarizing here the main points .",
    "we have built the complete spectra of isoscalar modes of @xmath72 equal to 2@xmath73 , 3@xmath74 and 4@xmath73 . in the configurations of @xmath17 however , only states with more than 1% of the total strength , and with energy less than 20 mev , were included .",
    "the low - lying @xmath75 state was also included , but its contribution was found negligible .",
    "the collective states included in the calculations with siii have been shown in @xcite , and those corresponding to sgii are shown in table  [ table : pho ] and compared with @xcite . the limits in the accuracy with which this skyrme - rpa calculation can reproduce the experimental findings are comparable to the case of similar calculations performed in the past decades . at this point we can build the matrix elements of the operator @xmath76 as in eq .   ( [ me_wdown ] )",
    "( these are essential ingredients to build the matrix elements on tda basis ) .",
    "@xmath77 of ( [ me_wdown ] ) is a sum of terms whose diagrammatic representation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] . to evaluate these diagrams an expression for the interaction vertices is needed .",
    "this is provided by the particle - vibration coupling model , by introducing a one - body field which can be written in the form @xmath78 in this equation , we have introduced the radial transition density @xmath79 of the @xmath48 states of the spectrum of phonons with angular momentum @xmath80 .",
    "this is defined in terms of the rpa states as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the creation and annihilation operators of a nucleon at point @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the form factor @xmath85 appearing in ( [ pvc ] ) is related to the ph interaction derived from the skyrme force by @xmath86 , as in @xcite .",
    "once all these starting points are given , the evaluation of the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] is straightforward and their detailed expressions are given in appendix a.    up to here , the procedure is the one already applied for the giant monopole resonance in @xcite .",
    "since we deal here with charge - exchange modes , it must be noted that the operator ( [ op_wdown ] ) can mix states with different isospins .",
    "the coupling ( [ pvc ] ) is manifestly a scalar in the total fermion - boson isospin space .",
    "but the intermediate states @xmath21 do not have pure isospin , as they contain a proton particle and a neutron hole ( see the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : dia ] , where the phonons are isoscalar and therefore do not cause any change in the fermion isospin in the intermediate states , with respect to the initial state ) .",
    "this leads naturally to a coupling of the iar , which has isospin quantum numbers @xmath87 where @xmath88 , with states which in general have a mixture of different @xmath89 components .",
    "the nuclear part of the hamiltonian actually forbids this coupling , and we impose that it is strictly forbidden ( this amounts to neglecting coulomb effects in the residual interaction ) .",
    "this can be done by projecting out the @xmath90 component of the intermediate state @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , we can write in isospin space @xmath91 and we define three projectors @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 such that @xmath95 the coefficients @xmath96 are simply geometrical factors ( clebsch - gordan coefficients ) , @xmath97 therefore , in the iar case the correct spreading operator having the right isospin structure is @xmath98 actually , the matrix elements of this operator are simply proportional to those of ( [ op_wdown ] ) , the multiplicative constant being @xmath99 . in the gtr case , we use the operator @xmath100 defined in a fully analogous way , and thus proportional to ( [ op_wdown ] ) by means of the constant @xmath101 .",
    "this procedure allows us to respect isospin symmetry .",
    "a similar procedure was not necessary in the iar calculations of @xcite and @xcite , where the intermediate states @xmath21 were chosen as 2p-2h configurations .",
    "the interaction @xmath102 was the nuclear two - body interaction , and the approximation used corresponds to the well - known second rpa ( srpa ) .",
    "this automatically preserves the isospin structure , due to the respect of conservation laws in srpa @xcite , and to the character of the interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "an approach similar to ours has been used in @xcite for the gtr without any isospin factor , i.e. , with the spreading operator ( [ op_wdown ] ) ; as the correct one , @xmath100 , differs by a factor @xmath101 close to 1 in the case of @xmath2pb , the numerical results are not markedly affected by this neglecting of isospin symmetry .",
    "the calculated strength distributions in the iar region are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : iarsk3 ] ( interaction siii ) and  [ fig : iarsg2 ] ( interaction sgii ) .",
    "table  [ table : main ] includes the main quantities which can be extracted from these strength distributions , that is centroid energy , width and percentage of strength of the resonance . from the tda calculation ,",
    "a discrete state emerges which , in siii and sgii case respectively , lies at 18.59 mev or 18.54 mev , and carries 86% or 87% of the total strength @xmath103 of the operator @xmath104 .",
    "in fact , isospin is explicitly projected out only in the spreading term , whereas the tda calculation is performed in a space with all isospin components included .",
    "nevertheless , the strength relative to @xmath105 operator selects as most collective state a single one , which was checked to be almost pure in isospin by looking at its @xmath106 expectation value . in figs .",
    "[ fig : iarsk3 ] and  [ fig : iarsg2 ] the dashed line corresponds to a calculation with @xmath33 only , and the full line to the complete calculation .",
    "we remark first that , in contrast with other modes where a certain amount of fragmentation is present , in this case this strength function is essentially due to a single state .",
    "the effect of @xmath107 is to shift slightly the peak energy and to produce a total width .",
    "with siii , the peak is at 18.49 mev and has a width of 152 kev whereas the corresponding values are 18.64 mev and 99 kev with sgii . in both cases",
    "the state exhausts 97% of @xmath105 strength .",
    "if one performs calculations with @xmath33 or @xmath68 only , one can obtain separately @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we find that the sum @xmath108 is equal , within a few percent , to the total width in the complete calculation .",
    "it can be seen that this width is rather sensitive to the interaction used , since the width calculated with siii is 50% larger than that of sgii .",
    "the complex collective state , expanded on the tda basis , shows a squared overlap of 0.90 ( resp .",
    "0.91 ) with the collective tda state if one calculates with siii ( resp .",
    "sgii ) . we must also mention that the spreading term @xmath68 has been calculated with an averaging parameter @xmath109 added to the denominator of ( [ op_0 ] ) , for reason of convenience .",
    "this means that one makes a lorentzian averaging of the distribution of intermediate states @xmath21 , with @xmath110 corresponding to half of the lorentzian width .",
    "the quantity @xmath110 has been chosen to be 100 kev , but results are stable with respect to its variation , as doubling @xmath110 implies an increase by only about 20 kev in the total width .",
    "experimental values for iar excitation energy and total width are respectively 18.8 mev and 232 kev @xcite .",
    "this states exhausts more or less the whole @xmath105 strength .",
    "branching ratios corresponding to proton emission leaving the residual nucleus in a valence neutron hole state of @xmath111pb are shown in tables  [ table : iarsk3 ] and  [ table : iarsg2 ] . in these tables , the column labelled `` only @xmath33 '' refers to a calculation with only the escape included , and the results correspond to those of @xcite .",
    "the other three columns under `` @xmath112 '' include the results of the complete calculation . column ( a ) corresponds to the case where the final states are pure hartree - fock ones .",
    "these final states can be renormalized by means of energy and spectroscopic factors , either calculated with the same skyrme force , and we have these values in the siii case in @xcite so we can show the corresponding results for the branching ratios in column ( b ) , or taken from empirical estimates @xcite , and the branching ratios obtained in this way are shown in column ( c ) .",
    "these calculated results are compared with the experimental values quoted in ref .",
    "the agreement of the total sum of branching ratios with the experimental value in the siii case and in column ( b ) is quite remarkable , as this is the most consistent fashion to perform a theoretical calculation .",
    "minor discrepancies are found by looking in the same column at individual channels . on the other hand , calculated decay branching ratios depend sensitively on the skyrme force employed , even when predicted peak energy and strength are practically the same . by examining the iar wave function obtained from our calculation , we have noticed that the ph amplitudes corresponding to a change in the principal quantum number @xmath113 are not negligible and this indicates that a simple picture of the iar as given by a @xmath114 wave function is slightly too schematic , at least in the nucleus we have considered .",
    "we follow a similar pattern in presenting the results for the gtr in @xmath2bi . figs .  [",
    "fig : gtrsk3 ] and  [ fig : gtrsg2 ] show the strength functions calculated respectively with siii and sgii interactions and table  [ table : main ] includes centroids , widths and percentage of strength of these distributions . with siii ,",
    "at least two main states contribute : besides the main bump at about 21.50 mev , a smaller one appears at lower energy . in the case of sgii , there are two smaller bumps in addition to the main one at about 23 mev .",
    "one can understand this broadened line shape by looking at the underlying complex states coming out of the diagonalization of the effective hamiltonian ( [ h_eff ] ) .",
    "there are several important complex states spread over the energy interval 18 - 25 mev .",
    "this is in contrast with the iar case and it can be understood by relating to the larger density of @xmath115 states compared to that of @xmath90 states , in this energy region of the @xmath2bi spectrum .",
    "the effect of @xmath68 coupling is much stronger for gtr and consequently it admixes tda states more than for iar . the percentage of the total strength of the gtr operator @xmath116 ( the so - called ikeda sum rule , equal to @xmath117 ) , is about 61% in the energy region 18 - 24 mev for siii , and about 68% in the interval 19.5 - 24.5 mev , for sgii .",
    "this contrasts with the calculation with continuum only , where about the same fraction of strength is exhausted by the main narrower peak . in the complete calculation",
    "the remaining strength is found outside the forementioned interval ( @xmath118 ) and is rather fragmented .",
    "experimentally , the strength concentrated in the gtr peak is about 50% of the total but this percentage rises up to about 60 - 70% if the whole energy region with some strength around the main bump is considered @xcite .",
    "all the present theoretical results were calculated with an averaging parameter @xmath110 equal to 250 kev .",
    "again , the stability of the results has been checked by varying @xmath110 .    besides the peak energy",
    ", we can extract from the strength distribution a mean energy , given by @xmath119 and this turns out to be 21.11 mev ( siii ) or 22.43 mev ( sgii ) .",
    "both values of @xmath120 are somewhat larger than the experimental excitation energy of gtr which is 15.6 mev in @xmath2bi , corresponding to 19.2 mev with respect to the @xmath2pb ground state . as for the width , the fwhm is not well defined in this case due to the double or triple peak .",
    "if we extract a value for the variance @xmath121 from the strength distribution , by defining @xmath122 we obtain a full width in gaussian approximation ( @xmath1232.4@xmath121 ) of about 3 mev for both interactions ( slightly larger for sgii ) , to be compared with an experimental value of 3.8 mev @xcite .",
    "of course , a model in which only the simplest class of `` doorway states '' is considered and not their full hierarchy , can not but underestimate the width .",
    "the same model seems to predict correctly the giant monopole width @xcite which is mainly due to landau damping .",
    "the overestimation of the peak energy , and the missing part of the damping effect , is probably the cause of a result for the branching ratios which correspond to a higher yield than the experimental one , as shown in tables  [ table : gtrsk3 ] and  [ table : gtrsg2 ] . here ,",
    "as the strength is spread over several mev , we can not calculate the branching ratios at a definite energy , as it was done for iar , and we rather make an average over the energy interval ( @xmath118 ) of the numerator and denominator of ( [ bc ] ) : @xmath124 tables  [ table : gtrsk3 ] and  [ table : gtrsg2 ] are displayed similarly to tables  [ table : iarsk3 ] and  [ table : iarsg2 ] except for the column ( b ) of the theoretical findings which we discuss below .",
    "first , one can notice that the discrepancy with experiment is reduced when going from self - consistent continuum rpa ( column `` only w@xmath125 '' ) to the complete model .",
    "the results of sgii are in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "we must also mention that preliminary indications from the msu experiment @xcite leave open the possibility that experimental branching ratios might be larger than found in @xcite . on the other hand , the sensitivity of predictions with respect to the choice of the interaction is still present .",
    "we also show in column ( b ) of tables  [ table : gtrsk3 ] and  [ table : gtrsg2 ] what the proton yield would be , if the excitation energy corresponded to the experimental one ( 19.2 mev ) . the branching ratios of column ( b ) have indeed been obtained by calculating the escape amplitudes ( [ ga ] ) with the experimental outgoing proton energies @xmath18 .",
    "the empirical spectroscopic factors @xcite already used in the case of iar are also included .",
    "this renormalization obviously decreases the branching ratios and they are in good agreement with experiment in the case of sgii force .",
    "the final difference between theory and experiment , in the case of siii force , is of the same order , of even smaller than the one found in the case of the giant monopole resonance @xcite , and simply indicates once more the limit one could expect in this kind of detailed study , due to the present uncertainity in the nuclear dynamics at low energy .",
    "we can finally compare our results obtained without the spreading terms with those of muraviev and urin @xcite which are calculated in a continuum - rpa approach , where phenomenological inputs for the mean field and residual interaction are used .",
    "the large differences between the two sets of results can not be explained by invoking the approximation made in the present work in treating the single - particle continuum , as already discussed after eq .",
    "( [ appr_wup ] ) .",
    "it should be attributed to the sensitivity of branching ratios to the details of the inputs . as we have seen here differences in results coming from the same model but using two different skyrme interactions",
    ", it is not too surprising that results from phenomenological rpa calculations , based on a woods - saxon potential and a residual interaction of the landau - migdal type can also differ .",
    "a similar situation also exists in the giant monopole resonance case @xcite .",
    "within linear response theory , a microscopic model of collective excitations based on rpa states coupled to doorway states composed of 1p-1h configurations plus a collective vibration , and to 1p-1h continuum states has been applied to the study of the properties of two important charge - exchange modes , the iar and gtr in @xmath2bi .",
    "the two types of coupling are intended to describe the essential physical mechanisms leading to the spreading of the collective mode and its decay by nucleon emission .",
    "the model contains no free parameter but depends on the choice of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the physical quantities which can be calculated are the strength distributions and the cross sections of nucleon decay into various channels . from these quantities",
    "centroid energies , widths and particle decay branching ratios are obtained .",
    "the calculated results show some sensitivity to the choice of the effective interaction .",
    "in the iar case , both siii and sgii interactions predict the correct peak energy , and siii gives a good description of the data for the decay branching ratios whereas sgii tends to underestimate the branching ratios as well as the total width .    for the gtr ,",
    "interactions siii and sgii overestimate the mean energy respectively by 2 and 3 mev , while they both predict a total width of about 3 mev , i.e. , 75% of the experimental value . looking at branching ratios , it appears that sgii comes very close to experiment if one corrects for the overestimate of the gtr energy .",
    "the discrepancy with experimental values ( in the case of siii ) is of the same order or even smaller than that already found in the case of the isoscalar monopole resonance using the same model .",
    "this level of agreement with experiment indicates the present limits of existing skyrme effective interactions .",

    "it is known ( see , e.g. , the first chapter of @xcite ) that diagonalizing an effective hamiltonian including this term besides the rpa one , and with a set of 2p-2h configurations in the @xmath17 space , amounts to solve @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the rpa matrices and @xmath68 has the matrix elements defined by ( [ me_wdown ] ) .",
