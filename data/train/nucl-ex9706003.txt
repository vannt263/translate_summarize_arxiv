    "_ @xcite and cranston and white @xcite . summarizing the previous experiments , in the experimentally analyzed energy range the @xmath0ca(n,@xmath3)@xmath4ca cross section shows an almost pure @xmath2 behaviour which is typical for @xmath5wave capture . however , there is some evidence for a deviation from the @xmath2 law at @xmath6 in ref .",
    "@xcite where the experimental value is roughly 25% smaller than the calculated cross section ( corresponding to 2.8 times the uncertainty of the experiment ) .",
    "this behaviour can be explained either by the uncertainty of the experiment or by a destructive interference between the non  resonant dc and a @xmath7 @xmath5wave resonance at @xmath8 @xcite which should have been observed in the tof experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the most important energies for astrophysical scenarios are in the order of 10 to 100 kev .",
    "therefore we measured the neutron capture cross section of @xmath0ca using a quasi  maxwellian neutron energy spectrum with @xmath1 which is obtained by bombarding a thick tritium target with protons at @xmath9 ( 72 kev above the t(p , n ) threshold at @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup using the fast cyclic activation technique is close to the one described in refs .",
    "the sample is irradiated for a period @xmath11 , after this irradiation time the sample is moved to the counting position in front of a high  purity germanium ( hpge ) detector ( @xmath12 ) , the @xmath3rays following the @xmath13decay of @xmath4ca are detected for a time interval @xmath14 , and finally the sample is moved back to the irradiation position ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the whole cycle with duration @xmath16 is repeated many times to gain statistics .    the sample material consisted of caco@xmath17 powder enriched by 77.87  % in @xmath0ca .",
    "two samples were available with a diameter @xmath18 and masses @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the samples were sandwiched between two thin gold foils ( @xmath21 per foil ) , and both the sample and the two gold foils were put into a cylindrical polyethylen container with an inner diameter of 6 mm .",
    "the experiment was performed at the 3.5 mev van  de - graaff accelerator rosenau at the university of tbingen where a tritum target with an activity of 5 ci is available for the neutron production with the @xmath22h(p , n)@xmath22he reaction .",
    "the thickness of the titanium layer which contains the tritium is about 150 kev ? ? ? at @xmath9 .",
    "the neutron flux was limited by the relatively low beam current of about @xmath23 . using this current",
    "the temperature of the tritium target remained below @xmath24 c , and a constant ratio between the neutron flux and the proton beam current could be observed during the whole experiment .",
    "furthermore , the depth profile of the tritium target was constant during the experiment .",
    "this was controlled by measuring the neutron yield at different energies between the ( p , n ) threshold and @xmath9 .",
    "changes in the depth profile would affect the neutron energy spectrum .",
