    "the standard model of particle physics consists of    1 .   the theory of the strong interactions ( qcd)@xcite , 2 .",
    "the theory of the electroweak interactions , based on the gauge group @xmath4@xcite .",
    "the theory of qcd is an unbroken gauge theory , based on the gauge group @xmath5 , acting in the internal space of  color  .",
    "the basic fermions of the theory are the various quarks , which form color triplets .",
    "the 8 massless gauge bosons are @xmath5 octets , the gluons .",
    "the interactions of the quarks and gluons are dictated by the gauge properties of the theory .",
    "the quarks and gluons interact through the vertex @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the quark fields and @xmath8 the eight gluon fields .",
    "the eight @xmath5matrices are denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the strength of the coupling is given by the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "qcd is a non  abelian gauge theory .",
    "this implies that there is a direct coupling of the gluons among each other .",
    "there is a trilinear coupling , proportional to @xmath10 , and a quadrilinear coupling , proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "it is assumed , but thus far not proven , that the qcd gauge interaction leads to a confinement of all colored quanta , in particular of the quarks and the gluons . replacing the continuous space ",
    "time continuum by a lattice , one can solve the qcd field equations with the computer .",
    "the results confirm the confinement hypothesis , but it remains unclear whether one can perform the limit , in which the lattice spacing goes to zero , without changing the result .",
    "the experiments strongly support the qcd theory .",
    "it has the property of asymptotic freedom : the strength of the interactions goes to zero on a logarithmic scale at high energies . at low energies the interaction gets large , and the confinement property might indeed be true .",
    "the equations , describing the renormalization of the coupling constant , give for @xmath12 : @xmath13 ( @xmath14 : number of quark flavors with mass less than the energy scale @xmath15 ) .    since the interactions gets weak at high energies , the quarks and",
    "also the gluons appear nearly as pointlike objects at small distances .",
    "this has been observed in the experiments of deep inelastic scattering of electrons , myons and neutrinos off nuclear targets .",
    "since the strong coupling constant at high energies is small , but not zero , one expects small departures from the pointlike structure , i. e. violations of the scaling behaviour of the cross - sections .",
    "this has been observed in many experiments , supporting the qcd theory .",
    "the value of the qcd coupling constant @xmath12 depends on the energy .",
    "one has found in the analysis of the scaling violations : @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : mass of the @xmath18boson , @xmath19 )",
    ".    one can express @xmath20 as a function of the qcd scale parameter @xmath1 : @xmath21 the experiment give : @xmath22 the standard electroweak model is based on the gauge group @xmath4 .",
    "there are three @xmath23bosons , related to the @xmath24 group , and one @xmath25boson , related to the @xmath26group .",
    "the lefthanded quarks and leptons are @xmath24doublets , the righthanded ones are singlets .",
    "thus parity is violated maximally .",
    "the gauge invariance of the @xmath27model is broken spontaneously by the ",
    "the masses for the gauge bosons are generated by the spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "goldstone bosons end up as longitudinal components of the gauge bosons . in the ' ' higgs `` mechanism",
    "there exists a self  interacting complex doublet of scalar fields . in the process of symmetry breaking the neutral component of",
    "the scalar doublet acquires a vacuum expectation value @xmath28 , which is directly related to the fermi constant of the weak interactions .",
    "thus the vacuum expectation value is known from the experiments , if the theory is correct : @xmath29 this energy sets the scale for the symmetry breaking .",
    "three massless goldstone bosons are generated , which are absorbed to give masses to the @xmath30 and @xmath18bosons .",
    "the remaining component of the complex doublet is the ' ' higgsboson , thus far a hypothetical particle",
    ". it would be the elementary scalar boson in the standard model .",
    "one hopes to find this particle with the new accelerator lhc at cern , which starts to operate in 2008 .    in the @xmath4 model",
    "there are two neutral gauge bosons , which are mixtures of @xmath31 and @xmath25 , the @xmath18boson and the photon .",
    "the associated mixing angle @xmath32 is a fundamental parameter which has to be fixed by experiment .",
    "it is given by the @xmath18mass , the fermi constant and @xmath0 : @xmath33 using @xmath34 , one finds : @xmath35 note that @xmath36 is also related to the mass ratio @xmath37 : @xmath38 in the standard model the interactions depend on 28 fundamental constants , e. g. on the finestructure constant @xmath2 .",
    "there were many attempts to get further insights , how these constants arise and whether one might calculate them , but thus far all without success . at the moment",
    "we can only determine these constants by the experiments .    in physics",
    "we are dealing with the laws of nature , but little thought is given to the boundary condition of the universe , related directly to the big bang .",
    "we do not know at the moment , what role is played by the fundamental costants , but these constants could form a bridge between these boundary conditions and the local laws of nature .",
    "thus they would be relicts of the big bang .",
    "what are the fundamental constants ?",
    "some physicists believe that at least some of them are just cosmic accidents , fixed by the dynamics of the big bang .",
    "if the big bang would be repeated , these constants would take different values .",
    "thus the constants are arbitrary , depending on details of the big bang .",
    "obviously in this case there is no way to calculate the fundamental constants .",
    "indeed , some fundamental constants might be cosmic accidents , but it is unlikely , that this is the case for all the 28 fundamental constants .",
    "new interactions , discovered e. g. with the new lhc  accelerator at cern , might offer a way to calculate at least some of the fundamental constants .",
    "we also do not understand , why the fundamental constants are constant in time .",
    "small time variations are indeed possible and even suggested by astrophysical experiments . in the theory of superstrings one expects time variations of the fundamental constants , in particular of the finestructure constant , of the qcd scale parameter , and of the weak interaction coupling constants .",
    "if one finds that the fundamental constants are changing in time , then they are not just numbers , set into the fabric of basic physics ",
    "rather they would be dynamical quantities which change according to some deeper laws that we have to understand .",
    "these laws would be truly fundamental and may even point the way to a unified theory including gravity .",
    "the standard model is the successful theory of the observed particle physics phenomena .",
    "however , the electroweak interactions and qcd depend on 28 fundamental constants , and within the standard model there is no way to calculate these constants or to derive relations between them .",
    "the most famous fundamental constant is the finestructure constant @xmath0 , introduced in 1916 by arnold sommerfeld : @xmath39 in this constant the electromagnetic coupling @xmath40 enters , as well as the planck constant @xmath41 , the constant of the quantum physics , and the speed of light @xmath42 , the basic constant of the theory of relativity .",
    "sommerfeld realized that @xmath0 is a dimensionless number , close to the inverse of the prime number 137 .",
    "the experiments give the following value for @xmath43 : 137,03599907(9 ) .",
    "as early as 1905 max planck pointed out in a letter to paul ehrenfest that @xmath41 and @xmath44 , both having the physical dimension of an action , were roughly of the same magnitude .",
    "adams and lewis@xcite proposed in 1914 a relation between @xmath45 and @xmath42 : @xmath46 this can be rewritten as follows : @xmath47 the numerical value for @xmath48 is 137,348 , which is rather close to the modern value 137,036 .",
    "heisenberg proposed in 1936 : @xmath49 which gives @xmath50 .    in 1971",
    "wyler@xcite published the following expression for @xmath0 , @xmath51 which gives @xmath52 and agrees well with the experimental value .",
    "richard p. feynman wrote about the finestructure constant@xcite :  it has been a mystery ever since it was discussed more than fifty years ago , and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it .",
    "immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from : is it related to @xmath53 or perhaps to the base of the natural logarithms ?",
    "nobody knows .",
    "it s one of the greatest mysteries of physics : a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man   .",
    "based on @xmath0 the theory of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) was developed , merging electrodynamics , quantum theory and relativity theory .",
    "it is the most successful theory in science , tested with a precision of @xmath54 .    in quantum field theory",
    "the number , describing the strength of the interactions , is not a fixed constant , but a function of the energy involved .",
    "this can be easily understood .",
    "the groundstate of a system , described by a quantum field theory , is filled with virtual pairs of quanta , e. g. with @xmath55pairs in qed .",
    "thus an electron is surrountded by @xmath55pairs .",
    "the virtual electrons are repelled by the electrons , the virtual positrons are attracted , and the electron charge is partially shielded by the virtual positrons .",
    "thus at relatively large distances ( larger than the compton wavelength of an electron @xmath56 ) the electron charge is smaller than at distances less than @xmath57 .",
    "the dependence on the energy is described by the renormalization group equations , first considered by murray gell  mann and francis low@xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59    in qed at high energies one has to include not only virtual @xmath55pairs , but also the @xmath60 and @xmath61pairs , as well as the quark  antiquark  pairs .",
    "doing so , one finds that the finestructure constant @xmath0 at the mass of the @xmath18boson should be the inverse of 127.8 , in very good agreement with the experimental data taken with the lep  accelerator .",
    "another fundamental parameter of the standard model is the proton mass . in the theory of the strong interaction qcd",
    "the proton mass is a parameter , which can be calculated as a function of the qcd scale parameter @xmath1 and of the light quark masses .",
    "the qcd scale parameter has been determined by the experiments : @xmath62 the qcd ",
    "theory gives a very clear picture of mass generation . in the limit , where the quark masses are set to zero ,",
    "the nucleon mass is just the confined field energy of the gluons and quarks and can be written as : @xmath63 the _ const .",
    "_ has been calculated using the lattice approach to qcd .",
    "it is about 3,9 , predicting a nucleon mass in the limit @xmath64 of about 860 mev .",
    "the observed nucleon mass ( about 940 mev ) is higher , due to the contributions of the mass terms of the light quarks @xmath65 , which in reality are not massless .",
    "the mass of the proton can be decomposed as follows : @xmath66 the last term describes the electromagnetic self  energy of the proton .",
    "this self ",
    "energy is also proportional to the qcd ",
    "scale @xmath67 .",
    "calculations give : @xmath68 the up  quark mass term contributes about 20 mev to the proton mass , according to the chiral perturbation theory , the d-.quark mass term about 19 mev .",
    "thus the @xmath69contribution to the proton mass is about as large as the @xmath70contribution , although there are two @xmath70quarks in the proton , and only one @xmath69quark .",
    "this originates from the fact that the @xmath69mass is larger than the @xmath70mass .    in chiral perturbation theory the @xmath70 and @xmath69masses",
    "can be estimated : @xmath71 these masses are normalized at the scale @xmath72 .",
    "note that quark masses are not the masses of free particles , but of the confined quarks .",
    "the quark masses depend on the energy scale @xmath73 , relevant for the discussion .",
    "the mass of the strange quark can also be estimated in the chiral perturbation theory . on finds for @xmath72",
    ": @xmath74 thus the mass of the strange quark is about 20 times larger than the @xmath69mass .",
    "although there are no valence @xmath75quarks in the proton , the numerous @xmath76pairs contribute about 35 mev to the proton mass , i. e. more than the @xmath77 or @xmath78pairs , due to the large ratio @xmath79 .",
    "the heavy quarks @xmath80 and @xmath81 do not contribute much to the proton mass .",
    "we can decompose the proton mass as follows : @xmath82 the masses of the heavy quarks @xmath42 and @xmath83 can be estimated by considering the spectra of the particles , containing @xmath42 or @xmath83quarks , e. g. the charm  mesons or the @xmath25mesons .",
    "one finds : @xmath84 the dark corner of the standard model is the sector of the fermion masses .",
    "there are the six quark masses , the three charged fermion masses , the three neutrino masses , the four flavor mixing parameters of the quarks and the six flavor mixing parameters of the leptons ( if neutrinos are majorana particles ) .",
    "altogether these parameters make up 22 of the 28 fundamental constants .",
    "the remaining six constants are @xmath85 , the mass of the @xmath23boson , the mass of the hypothetical  higgsboson and the constant @xmath86 for gravity .",
    "what are the fermion masses ?",
    "we do not know .",
    "they might also be due to a confined field energy , but in this case the quarks and leptons would have to have a finite radius , as e. g. in composite models .",
    "the masses would be generated by a new interaction .",
    "the experiments give a limit on the internal radius of the leptons and quarks , which is of the order of @xmath87 cm .    in the standard model",
    "the masses of the leptons and quarks are generated spontaneously , like the @xmath23 and @xmath18masses .",
    "each fermion couples with a certain strength to the scalar ",
    "higgs``boson via a yukawa coupling .",
    "the fermion mass is then given by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the vacuum expectation value of the ' ' higgsfield .",
    "for the electron this yukawa coupling constant must be very small , since @xmath89 is about 246 gev : @xmath90 nobody understands , why this constant is so tiny .",
    "the problem of fermion masses remains to be solved .",
    "it seems to be the most fundamental problem we are facing at the present time .",
    "if one is interested only in stable matter , as e. g. in solid state physics , only seven fundamental constants enter : @xmath91 the mass of the @xmath75quark has been included , since the @xmath92pairs contribute to the nucleon mass about 40 mev .",
    "these seven constants describe all atoms and stable nuclei .",
    "it is possible , that there exist relations between the fundamental constants .",
    "relations , which seem to work very well , are the relations between the flavor mixing angles and the quark masses , which where predicted some time ago@xcite : @xmath93 similar relations also exist for the neutrino masses and the associated mixing angles@xcite .",
    "these relations are obtained if both for the @xmath70type and for the @xmath69type quarks the following mass matrices are relevant ( texture 0 matrices ) : @xmath94 it would be interesting to know whether these mass matrices are indeed realized in nature .",
    "relations like the ones discussed above would reduce the number of fundamental constant from 28 to about 20 .",
    "recent observations in astrophysics@xcite indicate that the finestructure constant @xmath0 is a slow function of time .",
    "billions of years ago it was smaller than today . a group of researchers from australia , the uk and the usa analysed the spectra of distant quasars , using the keck telescope in hawaii .",
    "they studied about 150 quasars , some of them about 11 billion lightyears away .",
    "the redshifts of these objects varied between 0.5 and 3.5 .",
    "this corresponds to ages varying between 23% and 87% of the age of our universe .",
    "they used the  many multiplet method  and in particular studied the spectral lines of iron , nickel , magnesium , zinc and aluminium .",
    "it was found that @xmath0 changes in time : @xmath95 taking into account the ages of the observed quasars , one concludes that in a linear approximation the absolute magnitude of the relative change of @xmath2 must be : @xmath96 we like to mention that recent observations of quasar spectra , performed by different groups , seem to rule out a time variation of @xmath2 at the level given above@xcite .    the idea that fundamental constants are not constant in time , but have a cosmological time dependence , is not new . in the 1930s",
    "p. dirac@xcite discussed a time variation of newtons constant @xmath86 .",
    "dirac argued that @xmath86 should vary by about a factor 2 during the lifetime of the universe .",
    "the latter is now fixed to about @xmath97 .",
    "only a few years ago it was found that a possible time variation of @xmath86 must be less than @xmath98 per year , and dirac s hypothesis is now excluded .    in the 1950s",
    "l. landau discussed a possible time variation of the finestructure constant @xmath2 in connection with the renormalization of the electric charge@xcite .    in the 1970s french nuclear physicists discovered that about 1.8 billion years ago a natural reactor existed in gabon , west  africa , close to the river oklo .",
    "about 2 billion years ago uranium -235 was more abundant than today ( about 3,7% ) .",
    "today it is only 0,72% .",
    "the water of the river oklo served as a moderator for the reactor .",
    "the natural reactor operated for about 100 million years .",
    "the isotopes of the rare earths , for example the element samarium , were produced by the fission of uranium .",
    "the observed distribution of the isotopes today is consistent with the calculation , assuming that the isotopes were exposed to a strong neutron flux .",
    "especially the reaction of samarium with a neutron is interesting : @xmath99 it was known that the very large cross ",
    "section for this reaction ( about @xmath100 kb ) is due to a nuclear resonance just above threshold .",
    "the energy of this resonance is very small : @xmath101 .",
    "the position of this resonance can not have changed in the past 2 billion years by more than 0.1 ev .",
    "suppose @xmath2 has changed during this time .",
    "the energy of the resonance depends also on the strength of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "one concludes : @xmath102 taking into account the two billion years , the relative change of @xmath2 per year must be less than @xmath103 per year , as estimated by t. damour and f. dyson@xcite .",
    "this conclusion is correct only if no other fundamental parameters changed in the past two billion years . if other parameters , like the strong interaction coupling constant , changed also , the constraint mentioned above does not apply .",
    "the oklo constraint for @xmath2 is not consistent with the astrophysical observation for the relative changes of @xmath2 of order @xmath104 per year .",
    "no problem exists , however , if other fundamental  constants  also changed .",
    "below we shall see that this was indeed the case .",
    "recently one has also found a time change of the mass ratio @xmath105 one observed the light from a pair of quasars , which are 12 billion light years away from the earth@xcite .",
    "the light was emitted , when the universe was only 1.7 billion years old .",
    "the study of the spectra revealed , that the ratio @xmath73 has changed in time : @xmath106 taking into account the lifetime of 12 billion years , the change of @xmath73 per year in a linear approximation would be @xmath104 / year .",
    "we shall return to this time change of @xmath73 later .",
    "in the standard model we have three basic coupling constants , one for qcd @xmath107 and two for the electroweak interactions , based on the gauge group @xmath4 : @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the gauge group of the standard model is @xmath110 .",
    "the three gauge interactions are independent of each other .",
    "since 1974 the idea is discussed that the gauge group of the standard model is a subgroup of a larger simple group , and the three gauge interactions are embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "such a grand unification implies that @xmath111 and @xmath109 are related and can be expressed in terms of the unified coupling constant @xmath112 and the energy scale of the unification @xmath113 .",
    "the simplest theory of grand unification is a theory based on the gauge group @xmath114@xcite .",
    "the quarks and leptons of one generation can be described by two @xmath114representations .",
    "let us consider the 5representation of @xmath114 .",
    "after the breakdown of @xmath114 to @xmath115 we obtain : @xmath116 thus the 5representation contains a color triplet , which is a singlet under @xmath24 , and a color singlet , which is a @xmath24doublet .",
    "we can identify the associated particles , neglecting the flavor mixing , and obtain for the first lepton ",
    "quark family : @xmath117 the representation with the next higher dimension is the 10representation , which is an antisymmetric second ",
    "rank tensor .",
    "the 10representation decomposes after the symmetry breaking as follows : @xmath118 in terms of the lepton and quark fields of the first generation we can write the 10representation ( a @xmath119matrix ) as follows : @xmath120 combining these two representations , one finds precisely the lepton and quarks , forming one generation : @xmath121 for the first generation one has : @xmath122 the second and third generation are analogous .",
    "the unification based on the gauge gruop @xmath114 has a number of interesting features :    1 .",
    "the electric charge is quantized .",
    "@xmath123 2 .   at some high mass scale @xmath124",
    "the gauge group of the standard model turns into the group @xmath114 , and there is only one single gauge coupling .",
    "the three coupling constants @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath26 must then be of the same order of magnitude , related to each other by constants .",
    "+ the rather different values of the coupling constants @xmath125 at low energies must be due to renormalization effects",
    ". this would also give a natural explanation of why the strong interactions are strong and the weak interactions are weak .",
    "it has to do with the size of the corresponding group . + apart from normalization constants the three coupling constants @xmath127 and @xmath128 , are equal at the unification mass @xmath124 .",
    "thus the @xmath4 mixing angle , given by @xmath129 , is fixed at or above @xmath124 : @xmath130    at an energy scale @xmath131 the parameter @xmath132 changes along with the three coupling constants : @xmath133 at @xmath134 the electroweak mixing angle has been measured : @xmath135 .",
    "note that above the unification energy @xmath0 and @xmath136 are related : @xmath137 this relation can be checked by experiment . in order to get a rough agreement between the observed values for @xmath127 and @xmath128 and the values predicted by the @xmath114 theory",
    ", one can easily see that the unification scale must be very high .",
    "note that @xmath138 however , the precise values of the three coupling constants , determined by the lep  experiments , disagree with the @xmath114 prediction .",
    "the three coupling constants do not converge at high energies to a single coupling constant @xmath112 .",
    "however , a convergence takes place , if supersymmetric particles are added .",
    "supersymmetry implies that for each fermion a boson is added ( s  leptons , s - quarks ) , and for each boson a new fermion is introduced ( photino , etc . ) .",
    "these new particles are not observed in the experiments .",
    "it is assumed that they have a mass of about 1 tev or more .",
    "the new particles contribute to the renormalization of the gauge coupling constants at high energies ( about 1 tev ) , and a convergence of the three coupling constants taken place .",
    "thus a supersymmetric version of the @xmath114theory is consistent with the experiments .    in theories of grand unification like",
    "the @xmath114theory one has typically quarks , antiquarks and leptons in one fermion representation .",
    "this implies that the proton can decay , e. g. @xmath139 .",
    "the lifetime depends on the mass scale for the unification . for @xmath140 in the @xmath114theory without supersymmetry",
    "one finds @xmath141 years for the proton lifetime .",
    "the experimental lower limit is about @xmath142 years .",
    "there is a natural embedding of a group @xmath143 into @xmath144 , corresponding to the fact that @xmath145 complex numbers can be represented by @xmath146 real numbers .",
    "thus one may consider to use the gauge group @xmath147 instead of @xmath114 .",
    "this was discussed first in 1975 by p. minkowski and the author@xcite .",
    "the fermions of one generation are described by a 16dimensional spinor representation of @xmath147 .    since @xmath114 is a subgroup of @xmath147 , one has the following decomposition : @xmath148 thus the fermions of the @xmath114theory",
    "are obtained , plus one additional fermion ( per family ) .",
    "this state is an @xmath114singlet and describes a lefthanded antineutrino field . using the leptons and quarks of the first generation",
    "we can write the 16representation as follows in terms of lefthanded fields : @xmath149 an interesting feature of the @xmath147theory is that the gauge group for the electroweak interactions is larger than in the @xmath114theory .",
    "@xmath147 has the subgroup @xmath150 .",
    "since @xmath151 is isomorphic into @xmath152 , one finds : @xmath153 the group @xmath154 must contain the color group @xmath155 .",
    "the 16representation of the fermions decomposes under @xmath154 into two 4representations .",
    "these contain three quarks and one lepton , e. g. @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "one can interpret the leptons as the fourth color .",
    "however , the gauge group @xmath154 must be broken at high energies : @xmath158 we obtain at low energies the gauge group @xmath159 however , the masses of the gauge bosons for the group @xmath160 must be much larger than the observed @xmath23bosons , related to the group @xmath161 .    in the @xmath114theory the minimal number of fermions of the standard model is included .",
    "but in the @xmath147theory a new righthanded neutrino is added ( the @xmath162particle ) .",
    "this righthanded fermion is interpreted as a heavy majorana particle . in this case",
    "a mass for the lefthanded neutrino is generated by the ",
    "see  sawmechanism@xcite .",
    "thus in the @xmath147theory the neutrinos are massive , while in the @xmath114theory they must be massless .",
    "the @xmath147theory is much more symmetrical than the @xmath114theory , and it is hard to believe that nature would stop at @xmath114 , if nature has chosen to unify the basic interactions .    in the @xmath147theory",
    "there is one additional free parameter , related to the masses of the righthanded @xmath23bosons .",
    "since righthanded charged currents are not observed , the masses of the associated @xmath23bosons must be rather high , at least 300 gev .",
    "since there is this new parameter @xmath163 in the @xmath147theory , it can be chosen such that the coupling constant converges at very high energies , without using supersymmetric particles .",
    "if one chooses @xmath164 gev , the convergence occurs .",
    "the idea of grand unification leads to the reduction of the fundamental constants by one .",
    "the three gauge coupling constants of the standard model can be expressed in terms of a unified coupling constant @xmath165 at the energy @xmath113 , where the unification takes place .",
    "the three coupling constants are replaced by @xmath165 and @xmath113 .    in a grand unified theory",
    "the three coupling constants of the standard model are related to each other .",
    "if e. g. the finestructure constant shows a time variation , the other two coupling constants should also vary in time .",
    "otherwise the unification would not be universal in time . knowing the time variation of @xmath2",
    ", one should be able to calculate the time variation of the other coupling constants .",
    "we shall investigate only the time change of the qcd coupling constant @xmath166 .",
    "we can also calculate the time change of the weak coupling constant , but this would be useless , since we have no information about the weak coupling constant billions of years ago , at least not about small changes of the order of @xmath167 or less .",
    "we use the supersymmetric @xmath114theory to study the time change of the coupling constants@xcite .",
    "the change of @xmath2 is traced back to a change of the unified coupling constant at the energy of unification and to a change of the unification energy .",
    "these changes are related to each other : @xmath168    we consider the following three scenarios :",
    "the result given above is consistent with no time change for @xmath1 , but it also agrees with a small time change of the order of @xmath104 per year . if we assume that the electron mass does not change in time , such a change of @xmath1 would agree with the astrophysics result on the time variation of the ratio m(proton ) / m(electron ) .",
    "theoretically we would expect such a time variation if both @xmath124 and @xmath165 change in time , as discussed at the end of chapter 4 .",
    "in this review we have summarized our present knowledge about the fundamental constants and their possible time variation . today",
    "we do not know how these constants are generated or whether they might depend on time .",
    "the phenomenon of the fundamental constants in physics remains a mystery .",
    "there might be relations between these constants , e. g. between the flavor mixing angles and the fermion masses , or relations between the three coupling constants , implied by the idea of grand unification .",
    "this would reduce the number of basic constants from 28 down to a smaller number , but at least 18 fundamental constants would still exist",
    ".    a possible time variation of the fundamental constants must be rather slow , at least for those fundamental constants , which are measured very precisely , i. e. the finestructure constant , the qcd  scale @xmath67 , and the electron mass .",
    "the constant of gravity @xmath86 is known with a precision of @xmath98 .",
    "all other fundamental constants , e. g. the masses of the other leptons or the masses of the quarks , are not known with a high precision .",
    "we would not notice , if for example the mass of the @xmath204lepton would change with a rate of @xmath205 per year , or if the mass of the @xmath83quark would change with a rate of @xmath167 per years .",
    "the present limits on the time variation of the finestructure constant , the qcd scale or the electron mass are of the order of @xmath104 / year .",
    "these limits should be improved by at least two orders of magnitude in the near future .",
    "the astrophysics experiment @xcite indicates a time variation of @xmath1 of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "is this experiment correct ?",
    "we do not know .",
    "other astrophysics experiments should be carried out .",
    "these experiments have a time scale of about @xmath206 years .",
    "they can not determine a time variation at the present time , 14 billion years after the big bang .",
    "the experiment in quantum optics , however , have a time scale of only a few years , but a very high precision .",
    "if the astrophysics experiments indicate a time variation of the order of @xmath207 , it does not mean that experiments in quantum optics should also give such a time variation .",
    "it might be that until about 10 billion years after the big bang the constants did vary slowly , but after that they remain constant .",
    "no theory exists thus far for a time variation , and there is no reason to believe that a time variation should be linear , i. e. @xmath3 throughout the history of our universe . if the fundamental constants do vary , one would expect that the variation is rather large very close to the big bang . in the first microseconds after the big bang constants like @xmath2 or",
    "@xmath1 might have changed by a factor 2 , and we would not know .      in cosmology one should consider time variations of fundamental parameters in more detail .",
    "they arise naturally in the superstring theories . perhaps allowing a suitable time variation of the constants leads to a better understanding of the cosmic evolution immediately after the big bang .",
    "some , but not all fundamental constants might simply be cosmic accidents .",
    "but in this case the constants had a rapid time variation right after the big bang .",
    "if this is true , we shall never be able to determine theoretically the values of those constants . but allowing time variations might lead to better cosmological theories and to a better understanding of particle physics .",
    "particle physics and cosmology together would give a unified view on our universe .",
