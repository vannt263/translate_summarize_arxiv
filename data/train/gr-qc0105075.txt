    "we see the same qualitative features discussed in sec .",
    "ii.a in the context of the c - metric . in this case",
    "the fluid is accelerating something that we should expect since an external field ( in this case the external dipolar field ) exert a force on the fluid .",
    "like in the precedent case we solve eq .",
    "( [ diffuv ] ) , but to avoid the singularity at the black hole horizon , we use the tortoise radial coordinate @xcite , @xmath166 now , eq . ( [ diffuv ] ) reads , @xmath167_{,r^ * } + \\left[(1-v^2 ) \\phi_{,v }   \\right]_{,v } = 0,\\ ] ] and the particle density takes the form , @xmath168 } \\left [   { { u+1}\\over{u-1 } } ( \\phi_{,r^*})^2 + { { 1-v^2}\\over{(u+1)^2 } } ( \\phi_{,v})^2 \\right].\\ ] ]    from a computational view point the difference between a rigid sphere and a black hole laid in the inner boundary condition . for a rigid sphere",
    "the condition is zero normal velocity on its surface , and for a black hole is finite particle density on the horizon .",
    "this last condition requires that @xmath169 be limited in such a way that cancels the singular term in @xmath170 . in the general time",
    "dependent case this condition reads @xcite ,    @xmath171    where @xmath172 are functions of time coordinate .",
    "hence , the following equation is valid near @xmath173 @xmath174 = 0 . \\label{condtort}\\ ] ]    with the assumption that @xmath175 this condition is also valid in our case and it will be taken as the inner boundary condition . in ( [ expan ] ) we can not set @xmath176 because we can have @xmath177 .",
    "the outer condition for this problem is found integrating eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) as before .",
    "the numerical code employed is the same of sec .",
    "iv.a with the implementation of the inner boundary condition ( [ condtort ] ) and the change of @xmath83 or @xmath125 to the tortoise coordinate @xmath178 .",
    "the program was tested with the exact solution for a black hole in a moving fluid @xcite .",
    "the computed values of @xmath22 on the black hole horizon have less than @xmath179 of error when compared with the exact solution .",
    "again , outside the horizon the precision is better .    in fig .",
    "6 the streamlines of a perfect fluid in the presence of a black hole in an external dipolar moment field with @xmath162 are plotted .",
    "like the rigid sphere case the streamlines show little difference with respect to the case @xmath165 . in fig .",
    "we present the density contours for the same values of the parameters used in the previous figure .",
    "once more we see the same pattern encountered in the c - metric case .",
    "this shows that the effect of acceleration appears always in the density contours rather than in the fluid streamlines . in the last four figures we see that the streamlines are",
    "practically the same compared to the respective case with @xmath165 , but the density contours are quite different . the density contours for the different obstacles present remarkable similar features .",
    "we think that this pattern may be taken as test for the presence of acceleration in this kind of fluids .",
    "we can summarized the results of this work as follows : in the c - metric and dipolar field cases we found that , for a stationary fluid , the difference between the accelerate and non accelerate cases lies on the form of the density contours and not , as one may think , in the shape of the streamlines .",
    "we assumed in both cases that the acceleration is near zero . in the dipolar field case",
    "the potential flow becomes very unstable and the presence of chaos may appear @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the method presented hear is valid for a stiff equation of state and the incorporation of a new barotropic equation of state for the fluid is not easily applied . in that case",
    "we need a different approach for solving the difference equation ( [ eqphi ] ) because it is nonlinear and it is necessary to impose initial conditions to the enthalpy , this may help or not in the convergence of the method . a negative value of the enthalpy could indicate a nonstationary regime for the fluid , see for instance @xcite . in the different scenarios of this work",
    "the search for suitable boundary conditions to be treated , with @xmath74 , have been a constant problem , we think that this difficulties would increase with a new barotropic equation due to the condition for the enthalpy .",
    "future applications of this work could be the study of fluids with another equation of state to model a more realistic situation , the study of chaos in the presence of instabilities , and the study of fluids in non stationary states .",
    "all this applications are currently under investigation by the authors .",
