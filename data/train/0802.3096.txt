    "in his 1991 ph.d . dissertation , g. mcshane proved the striking identity    @xmath1 where the sum is taken over all simple closed geodesics of any fixed hyperbolic once - punctured torus , and @xmath2 is the length of the geodesic .",
    "this has been reproved in various ways : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; and generalized variously : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the identity has had deep applications due to mirzakhani @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we give a proof of the original identity that is , in a sense , intermediate to mcshane s original proof and bowditch s proof by markoff triples @xcite : it is geometric ; but lengths of geodesics do not enter directly . similar to @xcite , we take a classical approach ; ours involves a uniformizing fuchsian group .",
    "we avoid mcshane s invocation of a deep result of birman and series ; in its place , we show directly that the appropriate complementary set is of hausdorff dimension zero , and thus certainly of lebesgue measure zero , as the identity itself requires .",
    "this cantor set is the set of apexes of simple open geodesics that achieve their height .    in the following two paragraphs ,",
    "we sketch the proof .",
    "it is related most directly to the singular punctured sphere that is the quotient of the punctured hyperbolic torus by its elliptic involution .",
    "the simple closed geodesics on the torus and this sphere are in 11 correspondence ( and more ) . on the sphere , each simple closed geodesic bounces between two elliptic fixed points ; thus , any hyperbolic element of the uniformizing fuchsian group whose axis projects to the simple closed geodesic can be factored as a product of elliptics .",
    "but , our first lemma shows that any elliptic element of order two increases radii of circles whose apexes lie within its _ uplift region _ , bounded by euclidean hyperbolas , in the poincar upper half plane , @xmath3 .",
    "it is well known ( from the work of h. cohn and others ) that there is a lowest horocycle ( thus , informally , loop about the cusp ) on the hyperbolic torus beyond which no simple geodesic penetrates ; this is true as well for the quotient orbifold .",
    "the appropriate tree of simple closed geodesics elliptic factorizations gives a set of uplift regions ( suitably trimmed ) that fit together so as to raise all apexes ( below the lift of the fundamental horocycle ) other than those of simple closed geodesics highest lifts .",
    "these regions meet the lift of the fundamental horocycle in disjoint intervals , our _ excision intervals _ , indexed by the tree of simple closed geodesics .",
    "one easily shows that the union of the excision intervals lies in a finite interval ; the complement of their union is a cantor set .",
    "we show that along all but countably many branches of the tree , the limit of the ratios of excised interval to ambient interval is 1 .",
    "the cantor set thus has hausdorff dimension zero .",
    "it in particular has lebesgue measure zero ; but , the length of each excised interval is a multiple of a corresponding @xmath4 , and the full interval has length one - half this multiple , mcshane s identity follows .",
    "the cantor set in our construction is the set of apexes of lifts of those open simple geodesics that have a highest apex lift .",
    "the endpoints of our excision intervals correspond to geodesics that spiral about a simple geodesic , the remaining points correspond to ` irrational laminations ' .",
    "these facts can easily be verified by using @xcite ( see especially proposition 18 there ) or the more recent @xcite . whereas our excision intervals lie along the fundamental horocycle , @xcite finds his _ gaps _ along any fixed horocycle closer to the cusp than the fundamental horocycle .",
    "our approach relies in part on replacing fricke s equation ( in trace coordinates on the teichmller space ) : @xmath5 by an adjusted equation : @xmath6 . in the modular case of @xmath7",
    ", it was cohn s @xcite recognition that the adjusted equation is the classical markoff equation that led him to investigate the geodesy of the corresponding once - punctured hyperbolic torus",
    ".    our approach should recover results of @xcite in the setting of a hyperbolic torus with geodesic boundary .",
    "generalizations to higher genus must be carefully pursued : @xcite shows that there are non - simple geodesics whose self - intersections are not caused by parabolic elements ; such geodesics must then be low in the corresponding height spectrum and thus of highest lifts of apex exterior to all uplift regions .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize our techniques to hyperbolic surfaces with more general conical singularities , see @xcite and @xcite .    finally , we mention that our approach of trees of triples of order two elements is strongly reminiscent of work of l. yu .",
    "vulakh on the markoff and lagrange spectra and their generalizations , see for example @xcite .",
    "section [ backgr ] provides background material . in  [ uplift ] we define and give basic results on the basic tool , the uplift regions . in section [ frickedoms ]",
    "we normalize by using work of a.   schmidt so as to combine our earlier work on triples of elliptic elements with standard results on trees of simple closed geodesics on hyperbolic tori .",
    "we finish the proof in  [ finalarg ] .",
    "we use @xmath8 to denote points in @xmath3 .",
    "we call a geodesic of @xmath3 with its standard hyperbolic metric an _ h - line_. to increase legibility , all h - lines mentioned are non - vertical ( in the euclidean sense ) except as explicitly stated .",
    "we thank y. cheung for conversation related to this work .",
    "we also thank the referee for suggestions and references .",
    "each hyperbolic once - punctured torus has a weierstrass involution .",
    "the quotient of this torus by its involution gives a singular punctured sphere .",
    "indeed , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the sets of uniformizing groups : fuchsian groups of signature @xmath9 and fuchsian groups of signature @xmath10 , see say @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the simple closed geodesics of each such pair are also in one - to - one correspondence , see say @xcite ( here one finds that a simple closed geodesic on a hyperbolic punctured sphere with three elliptic order two singularities actually bounces back and forth between two of the singularities ) ; indeed , the lengths of corresponding simple closed geodesics are the same : in fact , there is a common element ( primitive in each of the groups ) whose axis projects to both geodesics .",
    "we refer the reader to section 2 of @xcite for a particularly nice discussion of the structure of the graph of generators of a group of signature @xmath10 , see the left side of figure [ gendualfig ] . here , vertices represent group elements , up to inverses and conjugation .",
    "edges connect pairs that generate the group ( which is a free group on two elements ) ; one calls either element in such a pair a _ generating element_. any generating element has axis projecting to a simple closed geodesic ; its inverse and any conjugate elements give the same curve ( up to orientation ) .",
    "thus , our vertices can be seen as corresponding to the simple closed geodesics of the torus uniformized by the group . as bowditch ( see especially the discussion on p. 49 of @xcite ) pointed out , the dual graph is particularly helpful when discussing fricke triples , see the right side of figure [ gendualfig ] .",
    "( each node of the resulting tree corresponds to a triple of simple closed geodesics such that a triple of corresponding open simple `` cusped '' geodesics is mutually disjoint . )",
    "we are interested in explicit lifts of simple closed geodesics . for this",
    ", we use a variation of a. schmidt s application @xcite of work of fricke .",

    "a full set of orbit representatives under the action of the teichmller group is given when one takes @xmath16 ; this can be deduced from @xcite , see also @xcite ; we will always assume that our fricke triples @xmath17 satisfy this restriction .",
    "note that the modular case of @xmath18 corresponds to @xmath7 and in this case @xmath19 is the conjugate of @xmath20 by the translation @xmath21 .",
    "( note that our @xmath20 is not that of @xcite . )      for ease of presentation , in @xcite we restricted to the modular case .",

    "each simple closed geodesic has a highest lift which is the axis of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is elliptic of order two .",
    "there is a factorization of @xmath26 as the product of elliptic elements such that a highest lifting segment of this simple geodesic joins the fixed point @xmath27 of @xmath28 to the fixed point @xmath29 of @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the fixed point of @xmath32 .",
    "a fundamental domain for @xmath33 is given by the hexagon of vertices : @xmath34 , @xmath31 , @xmath27 , @xmath35 , @xmath29 , @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 generates @xmath33 .",
    "given a fixed fricke triple @xmath17 , we have the corresponding _ adjusted fricke equation _",

    "one can show that there is such a factorization for every simple closed geodesic , and since the adjusted fricke equation is satisfied by the traces of appropriate triples of simple hyperbolic elements , one finds the following result",
