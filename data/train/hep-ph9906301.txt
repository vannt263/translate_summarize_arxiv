    "we now believe in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as _ the _ theory of strong interaction . yet , the centauro and anti - centauro events that were found in cosmic ray experiments @xcite indicate some puzzling features .",
    "the events are characterized by large fluctuations in the ratio of number of neutral pions to that of charged pions .",
    "it appeared to be unlikely that such feature can be realized inside the conventional picture of hadronic interactions with `` soft '' qcd interaction , which implies more or less an independent emission of particles .",
    "however , several authors formulated a scenario which explains such features of the events based on the idea of formation of chirally misaligned domains , the disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc ) @xcite .",
    "it requires that a `` hot '' matter forms during hadronic collisions in which the chiral symmetry is restored , and then it rapidly cools down so that chiral orientation of the pion fields can align to a random direction different from that of the vacuum .",
    "if the low momentum mode of the pion fields are enhanced large domains of definite ( but random in direction ) isospin would form . then , a large isospin , and therefore , charge fluctuations naturally results .",
    "the amplification of low momentum pion modes was demonstrated by rajagopal and wilczek @xcite by doing numerical simulation of the linear sigma model using the quench initial condition .",
    "a more explicit confirmation of the formation of large domains was provided by asakawa , huang and wang @xcite who computed pion - field correlation functions by using an elaborated simulation code which takes into account expansion along the longitudinal as well as the transverse direction .",
    "one should note , however , that the large charge - neutral fluctuation does not necessarily imply a random isotropic ( in isospin space ) rolling down from the top of the mexican hat potential . as was shown by greiner , gong and mller @xcite any isosinglet multipion states approximately have the well known neutral fraction distribution @xmath1 @xmath2 where @xmath3 we note that this distribution was in fact derived by only requiring the isospin singlet phase space @xcite .",
    "therefore , the large charge - neutral fluctuation may merely imply isospin singlet dcc state , not a random isotropic rolling down .",
    "the interpretation of the results of the simulation by rajagopal and wilczek @xcite also requires reexamination .",
    "they interpreted the origin of the amplification of the low momentum pion mode as due to instability of the nambu - goldstone modes of chirally symmetric field configurations at around the top of the mexican hat .",
    "however , the enhancement of the low momentum pion modes actually take place with much longer time scale than that of rolling down motion , @xmath4 , as one can clearly see in fig . 1 in their paper .",
    "then , we need to identify certain mechanism which is responsible for the enhancement .",
    "the most likely candidate , to our opinion , is the parametric resonance mechanism @xcite .",
    "the mechanism , possibly being tied up with a new instability that arises within the approximation scheme we will take , seems to be capable of explaining qualitative features of long lasting amplification of low momentum modes .",
    "( see sections 3 and 6 . )",
    "some other aspects of formation mechanism of dcc were explored in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we briefly explored the parametric resonance mechanism emphasizing its characteristic features in the two pion correlations , and its possible relevance as a hunting tool of dcc . in this paper",
    "we examine the mechanism in detail , hoping that it will shed some light to the origin of enhancement of the low momentum pion modes .",
    "we focus on the pion production at around the bottom of the mexican hat potential",
    ". it may be an appropriate setting at least for the late stage of non - equilibrium phase transition which would result in the formation of coherent dcc domains .",
    "furthermore , we concentrate on the case that the sigma model fields oscillate along the @xmath0 direction .",
    "in fact , it is shown in the numerical simulation @xcite that sigma model field configurations rapidly point to the @xmath0 direction in a time scale of the order of @xmath5 . under the background oscillation of the @xmath0 field",
    "the quantum fluctuations of the pion and the @xmath0 fields can be excited .",
    "if the frequencies of background and quantum fluctuations match with each other the fluctuations are parametrically amplified , leading to an explosive pion production .",
    "we emphasize that the mechanism of pion production from dcc which we explore in this paper differs from that is usually adopted in the literature @xcite as we mentioned earlier . in the conventional picture of pion emission from dcc , one assumes that the sigma model fields roll down along the direction ( in most cases ) different from the @xmath0 direction .",
    "then , the field configurations relax toward the @xmath0 direction , the orientation of the qcd vacuum , which entails the coherent pion emission through the relaxation process .",
    "in contrast , pion production takes place even when the sigma model fields rolls down along the @xmath0 direction in our parametric resonance mechanism . to indicate this point ,",
    "we propose in the next section a set of approximations that leads to a simplified but a concrete model field theory that allows us to construct explicitly the produced multi - pion quantum state .",
    "we should remark that we do not claim that the parametric resonance is the whole story .",
    "formation and decay of dcc is a complicated nonlinear phenomenon .",
    "the instability associated with the nambu - goldstone modes is indispensable ingredient for triggering the growth of the low momentum pion modes .",
    "but , we also stress that it is _ not _ enough either . in sec",
    "vi we will calculate the power spectrum of pion and sigma fields in our framework and attempt a qualitative comparison with the result obtained in rajagopal - wilczek s simulation .",
    "it will give us a feeling on the question of to what extent the amplification of power is due to the parametric resonance mechanism .    even though the parametric resonance mechanism is the cause of the long lasting amplification of low momentum modes we still lack understanding how the initial instability is mediated to it @xcite .",
    "leaving understanding of this last point to the future investigations our emphasis in this paper is that if the parametric resonance mechanism is operative at the late stage of the non - equilibrium phase transition it may give clear signatures which should be useful for its experimental hunting .    in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the linear sigma model , formulate the system with parametric resonance by introducing successive approximations in various stages , and make clear that to what extent the approximations are valid . in sec .",
    "iii , we quantize the system in a conventional way of quantizing a system of quantum fields , and clarify the relationship with the other formulation . in sec .",

    "v we discuss the two pion correlations which display another characteristic feature of the mechanism .",

    "we will summarize our investigation , give concluding remarks , and discuss the limitations of our framework . in appendix",
    "a , we summarize the feature of multiparticle states implied by the single mode squeezed state . in appendix b",

    "the typical values of the parameters which are relevant for phenomenology of qcd are : = 20 , v_0 = 90 , m_= = 140 .",
    "these values of the parameters will be used in the numerical analysis in later sections .    as discussed in the previous section we deal with the pion production that takes place when the sigma model fields are at around the bottom of the mexican hat potential , which may be realized in the time scale of @xmath5 after rolling down .",
    "we assume that at this stage the sigma model fields oscillate along the @xmath0 direction . for clarity",
    "we construct a further simplified model by doing successive approximations in the linear sigma model that allow us to explicitly construct the produced multi - pion quantum state .",

    "nevertheless , we believe that it is a meaningful starting point , and in fact it makes theoretical analysis transparent as we will see below .    we differ from mrwczyski and mller @xcite by treating @xmath16 and @xmath15 quantum mechanically .",

    "it is given roughly as @xmath37 and the same numerical examination indicates that it is at @xmath38 .",
    "we emphasize , therefore , that under the approximation of small amplitude oscillation of background fields , ignoring nonlinear terms in the field fluctuations is a good approximation in a fairly long time even for such strong coupling as @xmath39 .",

    "we discuss in this section the quantum evolution of the time - dependent states of @xmath50 and @xmath0 fluctuations .",
    "thanks to the restrictions and approximations introduced in the previous section , the structure of quantum states formed by @xmath16 and @xmath15 quanta can be analyzed analytically .",
    "we start by writing the hamiltonian in a form analogous to the harmonic oscillators but with time - dependent frequencies :    rl h = d^3 k & + & + & + _ j d^3 k , [ effectiveh ]    where    l _ ^(t)^2 = k^2 + m_^2 + 6v_0(t ) , +   + _",

    "if the background oscillation amplitude is larger than the critical value the system have an instability which we referred to as a new instability in introduction .",
    "it definitely arises within our approximation and is indicative of a remnant of the rajagopal - wilczek instability because it arises only for negative @xmath22 ( which means toward central maximum of the mexican hat ) .",
    "nevertheless , the new instability has a characteristic feature that is quite different from that of the rajagopal - wilczek s .",
    "the former can continue for long time while the latter lasts only a time scale of @xmath59 .",
    "notice that both of the instabilities that we are talking about are the local instabilities , not the real global ones which totally destabilize the whole system .",
    "the nature of the instability , however , is not transparent to us .",
    "when one works with certain truncation in highly nonlinear systems one easily generate instabilities which may or may not be possessed by the original system .",
    "there are instabilities that one can easily understand their origin from simple consideration .",
    "for example , pion fields can have local instability by generating the winding motion encircling around the bottom of the wine bottle when the field energy of background @xmath0 field oscillation with amplitude @xmath22 exceeds the symmetry breaking energy , that is , @xmath60 .",
    "it leads to the condition for onset of the instability @xmath61    but the instability we just encountered above occurs at much smaller amplitude , @xmath62 . to our knowledge there is no intuitive way of understanding the instability .",

    "we briefly describe some details of the computation of two pion distributions .",

    "similarly , @xmath129 is given as =    ( [ twopi+ ] ) and ( [ twopi- ] ) , we obtain two pion distributions of @xmath56-th isospin component as = = |_|^2(2|_|^2 + 1)= . via analogous ways , one can compute the following expressions of the elements of nontrivial two pion correlations .",

    "now we would like to discuss in some details the problem of the origin of the long lasting amplification of low - momentum pion modes seen in linear sigma model simulations , in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us first try to make a rough estimate of @xmath140 in their simulation .",
    "it is shown in fig.2 of @xcite that @xmath141 is given by a constant superposed by an oscillatory component during the time scale of about 10 - 40 in units of @xmath142 when large amplification takes place . here",
    "@xmath142 is the lattice constant and it is taken as @xmath143 in @xcite . since the frequency of the oscillatory component reflect the pion mass not the sigma mass it can not be used to estimate the amplitude of oscillation in sigma direction .",
    "we thus interpret ( a quarter of ) the constant component as a time and spatially averaged @xmath0 oscillation .",
    "since the low momentum modes are dominant at later times it may be utilized to estimate the amplitude of uniform background @xmath0 oscillations in our scheme . using the constant component of @xmath144 in @xmath141",
    "we obtain @xmath145 .",
    "it is a small number and indicates that our approximation is not totally absurd .",
    "but it is larger than @xmath146 , which implies that a new type of instability mentioned in sec .",
    "iii must also be excited .",
    "since we confine ourselves into @xmath57 in this paper , it is not possible to directly compare our parametric resonance mechanism to the rajagopal - wilczek simulation .",
    "nevertheless , we attempt to make a bold comparison between these two by estimating the power spectrum , the corresponding quantity to the power calculated by them .",
    "rajagopal - wilczek used the definition of power spectrum @xcite p_rw(,t)=1n^3|_n_1,n_2,n_3 e^ia ( , t)|^2,[powerrw ] where @xmath147 indicates ( one - dimensional ) box size and they used @xmath148 and @xmath149 denotes a single component of pion or @xmath0 fields at lattice cite @xmath150 .",
    "it has the dimension of @xmath151 and hence the ordinates in their fig.1 must be understood to be plotted in units of @xmath152 .",
    "we define the corresponding quantity , the power spectrum , in our framework .",
    "the natural definition is : p_ours(,t)=|q_(t)|^2 .",
    "[ powerhm ] the expectation value @xmath153 is to be evaluated by using the normalized squeezed state ( [ squeezed ] ) . when the fields are confined into a finite volume @xmath154 , fourier integral in ( [ defq_k ] ) is modified to the discrete summation of the form ( , t)=1_ke^-i q_(t ) , or inversely , q_(t)=1d^3xe^i ( , t ) .",
    "then , using @xmath155 , our power spectrum ( [ powerhm ] ) is related with theirs via the following relation : p_rw(,t)=p_ours(,t)/a^3 .",
    "[ power_relation ] it should be noticed that the number presented in @xcite is @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , we must plot @xmath157 to compare our power with theirs .",
    "we present our power spectra of pions and sigmas in fig.7 - 10 .",
    "we have adjusted some parameters so that they accord with the values adopted in @xcite ; @xmath158mev , @xmath159mev , @xmath160mev , though its effect is tiny and does not affect our conclusions .",
    "we employ the amplitude parameter of background oscillation as @xmath139 in order to avoid the instability",
    ".    in fig.7 plotted is the power spectrum of pions at @xmath81 .",
    "one can see that there is a lot of power at relatively low momentum modes .",
    "one may feel curious of the fact that the power is not small at @xmath81 at which we set the boundary condition of no particle production .",
    "one can easily verify that it is natural because the latter condition implies that @xmath161 and @xmath162 .    in fig.8",
    "we present the time evolution of power of pion field at @xmath163mev , which is the longest wavelength case depicted in fig.1 in @xcite and it is where the largest amplification occurs .",
    "we observe that the average power is of order unity as we expect from the above estimation .",
    "it is a reasonable result because it is off resonance .    with these parameters",
    ", the first resonance appears in @xmath164mev and the amplification of the power in this momentum bin is depicted in fig.9 .",
    "the @xmath165 is growing by a factor of 50 and reaches to @xmath166 which is similar order of magnitude with rajagopal - wilczek s . of course",
    ", two numbers can not be compared directly because of the difference involved between two computations including the initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative feature of the growing power to the same order of magnitude may be an indication that the parametric resonance mechanism plays an important role in the long lasting amplification of low momentum modes .",
    "one may argue that our results and rajagopal - wilczek s are qualitatively different because the amplification occurs in low momentum modes in their simulation , whereas it happens at resonance in our case .",
    "however , if we have not ignored the nonlinearity it might have mediated the enhancement at resonance to other modes .    in fig.10 plotted",
    "is the time evolution of power of sigma field at @xmath163mev as in fig.8 .",
    "the power of sigmas is an order of magnitude smaller than that of pions , in agreement with the feature obtained in rajagopal - wilczek s simulation .",
    "we now summarize our present understanding on possible origin of the long lasting amplification of low - momentum pion modes seen in the linear sigma model simulations .",
    "we have suggested that the parametric resonance might be the cause .",
    "the semi quantitative features of the power spectrum including its order of magnitude and the rate of growth is not inconsistent with our proposal .",
    "we also pointed out that a new type of instability exists in our approximation scheme which , if real , would enhance the amplification of low - momentum modes . we , however , failed to achieve an intuitive understanding of the physical origin of the new instability .",
    "we have discussed the pion production via the parametric resonance mechanism within the linear sigma model . in particular , stimulated by the feature of the numerical simulations of the linear sigma model , we focused on the scenario in which classical background oscillations of the sigma model fields are in the @xmath0 direction . assuming small amplitude oscillation which may be natural in the late stage of evolution of dcc , we have shown that one can ignore effects due to nonlinearity and quantum back reactions for sufficiently long time .",
    "thanks to this fact , we were able to construct an explicit quantum pion ( and sigma ) state which allows us to calculate the two particle correlations as well as the single particle distributions .    our treatment ,",
    "though under very restrictive assumptions , may be good enough to illuminate characteristic features of the parametric resonance mechanism .",
    "we formulated the quantum theory of the system with mathieu instability on a more conventional basis of quantum field theory and clarified the relationship between our and the formalism given by shtanov , traschen and brandenberger @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the computed single particle distributions and clarified the structure of narrow resonances characteristic to the parametric resonance mechanism .",
    "we then discussed the two pion correlations as a possible experimental probe for disoriented chiral condensate .",
    "since the two pion correlations have unique characteristics , the back - to - back ( in momentum space ) correlations , it must give a clear signature which should merit the experimental hunting of dcc .",
    "in particular , it can not be masked by the identical particle interference , the hanbury - brown - twiss effect @xcite .",
    "why two particle correlation ?",
    "it is certainly far more difficult to measure compared with the multiplicity distributions , on which all the recent experimental search for dcc rely @xcite .",
    "the global analysis using multiplicity distributions is powerful if large fractions of events are accompanied by the dcc domain formation . on the other hand ,",
    "a different strategy is required for hunting if dcc is a rare phenomenon .",
    "we have discussed possible origin of the long lasting amplification of low - momentum pion modes in the last section .",
    "our discussion can not be a complete one , but we hope that it stimulates the readers interests in this problem .",
    "we should mention about the limitation and the drawback in our treatment in this paper .",
    "we ignored the quantum back reaction and the instability of @xmath0 meson which should exist in the real world .",
    "it is the perfectly legitimate approximation if the amplitudes of background @xmath0 oscillations are really small .",
    "however , it is possible that the amplitudes are sometimes large because of the prevailing thermal fluctuations in the initial stage . since we are dealing with the system in which the coupling is really strong , most probably , the peak in the single particle distributions will go away after the quantum back reaction is taken into account .",
    "then , the key question is that if anything in our results remain valid after the quantum back reaction is taken into account .",
    "we argue that the answer is yes ; it is the characteristic features of the two pion correlations which are discussed in detail in sec . v. we now engage in a computation to verify our expectation .",
    "how about the @xmath119 coupling ?",
    "it is clear that it also tends to smear out the resonance peaks and , more importantly , may obscure the signature of the back - to - back correlations .",
    "again we need more elaborate treatment which includes the instability of @xmath0 to make definitive statement about how much the signature survive in the case with @xmath119 coupling .",
    "the formalisms which may be suitable for such analysis have been investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "there are also some recent proposals @xcite that the hadronic medium effects may induce the similar back - to - back correlations in momentum space , which would mimic the signature of dcc discussed in this paper .",
    "one would hope that it should be possible to find observational features which discriminate these two mechanisms .",
    "the task is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .    during the long term investigation we benefited from numerous conversations in various stages of this work with masayuki asakawa , dan boyanovsky , berndt mller , krishna rajagopal , and valery rubakov .",
